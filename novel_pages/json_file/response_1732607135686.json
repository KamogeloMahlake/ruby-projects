    "content": "<p>While I was torn between the amusement of being the target of the cheerleader equivalent of an attempted military coup and the pleasure I was getting from the perks of such an attempt. </p><p>Then, the busty black beauty that decided a slutty nun outfit was a great approximation of a bishop started walking forward, once again making me focus on the present. </p><p>She shook her head, her beautiful hair flailing freely, though my attention was more on her statuesque legs, looking particularly striking in the white stocking and garter belt she was wearing, though, every step of hers was straining her hips, showing her body needed just one excuse to get free of the restrictive confines of her outfit. </p><p>And I was more than happy to give her that excuse as she stood in front of me, leaning forward to give a glimpse of her cleavage but nothing more, as if she was going to play a slower game than her friends. </p><p>As much as I enjoyed being a part of their little game, it wasn’t to the point of allowing them to tease me as much as they wanted without consequences. I decided to give her body the excuse they needed to escape their prison and grabbed her costume and pulled. </p><p>The fabric was already thin, and against my sharp strength, it had no chance of resisting my pull, leaving her body naked. </p><p>Technically, not completely naked, but considering she was not wearing a bra or panties, and had just a garter belt and stockings on, it wouldn’t be an unfair statement to classify her as naked. “Naughty,” she gasped in a scandalized voice, but her shock didn’t prevent her from lowering her to my lap. </p><p>Unlike her friends, she chose to sit down while looking the other way, her back pressing against my chest and leaving her tits free to jump beautifully at every move. </p><p>And I was quick to grab her naked hips as she landed, enhancing her rhythmic display even more. She might not have the perfect physique of her friends, but her thickness was certainly an amazing benefit during a lap dance as she undulated back and forth, more than compensating for a lack of close attention after the distant show of the Latino beauty. </p><p>Pity I didn’t have enough cash to stuff into her stockings to enhance the impression even more. Instead, I decided to break the impression even more by moving my hands up, grabbing her legs, and forcibly widening them before letting my fingers drift toward her core. </p><p>Only to receive another pointed cough from Megan, who was still watching the show with a surprisingly calm attitude. </p><p>I caught her gaze and smirked and let my hands go back to her hips, but not before keeping them there just enough to make a point to her, showing that her control over our fake relationship was not as strong as she might have hoped. </p><p>Meanwhile, the black beauty grabbed my hands and dragged them up, allowing them to land on her even more impressive breasts, allowing me to dig into her soft skin, moaning beautifully under the dance of my fingers. </p><p>Too bad her song came to an end soon after as well, leaving me longing for more. “You should think about where you can get proper entertainment,” she whispered, which, unlike the other girls, was not particularly low. It was more accurately classified as stage-whisper. </p><p>The rest of the girls giggled playfully, while Megan’s expression got even stonier. But, before she could say anything, the beautiful busty redhead that was representing the queen walked forward, each step beautiful and measured, yet somehow radiating allure as she strained the capabilities of her black lingerie. </p><p>Yet, she didn’t sit down, but started fiddling with my belt. “You look too uncomfortable in those pants,” she said as she unbuttoned my pants and pulled them down with a speed that surprised me, leaving the task of hiding my erection to my boxers. </p><p>A task that they were woefully unequipped for. </p><p>“Damn,” she whispered as her gaze fell on my erection, her beautiful green eyes widening. “You have so much to offer,” she whispered before she turned to look at Megan. “Too bad you have a jealous bitch as a girlfriend, afraid to share. Pity, she’s afraid of a bit of competition.” </p><p>“Oh, sweetie, she’s not afraid of sharing, she’s just more selective about who to share with,” said a familiar voice. One that neither belonged to Megan nor to the cheerleaders.</p><p>I twisted my neck, only to see Kim already inside, leaning against the wall. Normally, I wouldn’t have missed her entrance, but in my own defense, a room full of beauties, some half naked while the rest completely naked, worked rather spectacularly as a distraction. </p><p>“K-Kim,” the redhead on my lap stammered fearfully, an attitude that she didn’t even display against the others. </p><p>I couldn’t help but chuckle at her reaction, though that didn’t prevent me from grabbing the arm of the redhead and pulling her onto my lap, with no intention of wasting time. Since she released the monster from its confines, she needed to pay for it. </p><p>As I guided her hips to rock, I looked at Kim, capturing the way she dressed. She had leaned into her street punk look, even more, replacing the jeans she wore previously with leather pants — which looked spectacular on her body while still giving an aura of danger. She didn’t have a leather jacket, just a white ripped t-shirt, one that split the difference between sexy and dangerous successfully. </p><p>Kim started walking forward, each step tense and threatening, at least against the cheerleaders, making them flinch. For me, it just made her more arousing, especially with the memories of the shower still bright in my mind. </p><p>The redhead was clearly scared of Kim, but luckily, for the sanity of my self-confidence, that fear soon lost its impact as I guided her hips to rock furiously on my lap. That advantage flickered slightly when Kim stood next to us and ripped off the bra of the other redhead in the room.  </p><p>Only to disappear once again as I used my lips to capture her recently-freed nipple and renew her pleasure. </p><p>Kim looked slightly miffed at the effects of her grand gesture destroyed as she tried to look dangerous and dominant, but her smirk was back when I caught her gaze and smirked at her, challenging her to impress me. </p><p>Her gaze widened, showing that she was more than happy to take on that challenge. </p><p>When the song was finished, Kim looked at the blonde cheerleader with an amused expression, one that she met with a similar expression, showing that it wasn’t a coincidence that she was playing the king in their little game. </p><p>“So, do you think you can handle a proper show before I bring him back to proper fun,” Kim said. </p><p>“Oh, I can handle anything you can give,” the blonde answered as she threw away the scepter she was holding before she walked forward. </p><p>Kim pushed the poor redhead away, but I decided to keep my mouth shut when she followed that by pulling down my boxers. </p><p>The matching gasps of appreciation as they fully appeared for the gazes of the sexy cheerleaders were certainly an ego boost. Pity that the room had frosted glass windows, preventing the rest of the party from getting a proper view of what was going on, just getting glimpses. </p><p>The resulting boost of Intent would certainly be useful. </p><p>“Let’s see if you can handle a proper one,” Kim said as she wrapped her blonde hair before pushing her head down, challenging the head cheerleader for a deep-throat. </p><p>What an interesting relationship they shared, I thought. I was fascinated by the dynamics between Megan, Kim, and the rest of the cheerleaders, almost as much as I was impressed by the way the blonde cheerleader’s throat wrapped around my shaft, pushing me dangerously toward the edge. </p><p>I had no doubt that, without the recent physical improvements that gave me a boost in pleasure, I would have exploded into her throat. </p><p>“Feel free to tap his leg whenever you want to surrender,” Kim said as she pushed the blonde down even more mercilessly, her gags filling the room, loud enough to suppress the music for a moment. </p><p>I might have thought that Kim was being too mean, if it wasn’t for the fact that she had subjected herself to that treatment just a few days ago, and handled that work excellently. </p><p>“Not as easy as you hoped, right?” Kim murmured. I couldn’t help but smile as I remembered myself uttering the exact same words. Amusingly, even the effect was the same, an impotent angry glare, though this time targeting Kim rather than me. </p><p>The blonde managed to show excellent resistance, avoiding the need to complain even as Kim pushed her down with increasing aggression. As minutes passed, Kim started to throw hesitant glares at me, clearly afraid that I would fold before the blonde. </p><p>Her fears were accurate, as, without the recent improvements and the increased bodily control they gave me, I would have already exploded. </p><p>Luckily for Kim’s little plan, the blonde tapped my leg soon after, and Kim let her go, watching as she coughed and gasped. “Too bad you can’t handle a proper man,” Kim said smugly before she pulled my boxers back on and grabbed my hand, then, looked at Megan. “Let’s go and reward the hero of the day, properly,” Kim said smugly. </p><p>“Exactly,” Megan said as she grabbed my pants that were on the floor before she hooked her arm to my right, while Kim took the left, guiding me out of the room wearing just my boxers and t-shirt, leaving a group of frustrated cheerleaders behind. </p><p>I waited until we left the room before whispering. “You better hope that your plan is sufficiently impressive,” I said, followed by a chuckle.</p><p>They really needed to offer a lot of benefits as well as an impressive show to prevent me from returning to the slutty embrace of six cheerleaders…  </p>",

    "content": "<p>For the next ten minutes, I continued massaging her neck steadily. </p><p>Soon, her squirming stopped being only about her excitement about the potential implications of the process, saving her from the plight she had been struggling for a long, long time, and started being about the subtle yet effective betrayal of her own body.  </p><p>I was not half-bad at giving massages, and the fact that she asked me to massage her neck made things even easier. There was no mystery about her decision. I needed touch to a naked part of her body to make the massage effective due to the special blocking nature of her robe, and the neck seemed innocent enough. </p><p>The key aspect, ‘seeming’ innocent. </p><p>Unfortunately for her, that choice betrayed her inexperience more than anything else, as the neck could be a surprisingly interesting location to focus on during foreplay. </p><p>Kissing and licking would have been much more effective, especially when interrupted by a few nibbles that left a lingering mark on her flawless skin, but my expert touch was still enough to awaken some of the instincts buried deep in her body. </p><p>Very slowly, of course, as the centuries that passed without a touch while combined with the emotional oppression of the Light node left those instincts buried deep, requiring a careful excavation. </p><p>Though, the emotional oppression of the light was certainly not as intense as Titania had been suffering due to her node. I didn’t know whether it was partly due to the headmistress’ natural light nature balancing the effect of the Light Spark, the constant exposure to the Darkness spark limiting its emotional suppression effect. </p><p>Or simply the fact that the construction method of the Light node was crude enough to trigger such an effect. </p><p>I could imagine a few experiments to test that aspect, but ultimately, I decided against it, instead focusing on the slow transformation of her Divine Spark, trying to understand the nature of the mysterious merger while I slowly awakened her latent desires. </p><p>She just accepted my massage, unaware of the danger it represented. </p><p>Another ten minutes passed before I pulled my next trick. I used my biomancy subtly to pull another trick, allowing it to build up a slow resistance at the area that I was touching, one that would dissipate in a few hours, so, all she needed was to ask for a break before letting me continue. </p><p>Or, ask me to touch somewhere else. </p><p>“We should pause,” I said, wanting to bring her attention to that fact. “The constant exposure of mana would awaken a natural resistance and reduce the effectiveness of the massage,” I said. </p><p>“Right now?” she said. </p><p>“I can always continue tomorrow,” I said, exaggerating the duration of the effect a bit, and she paused, her tenseness revealing what she had been thinking was rather important. </p><p>Of course, that resistance effect was barely more than a gimmick, one that she could display with a targeted flare, but that was under the assumption that she had noticed it. And, lost in the monumental nature of the situation, she didn’t even think about a deliberate trick, still operating under the assumption that I had no idea about the true effect of the massage. </p><p>The fight between her sense of propriety and her desire to finally get rid of her dangerous plight was obvious, especially with the nature of the simplest solution I left available to her. </p><p>“Maybe you should focus on my shoulders a bit,” she murmured. </p><p>Greed was taking hold of her beautiful heart. </p><p>“As you wish, boss,” I said, not bothering to hide the fascinated tone in my voice as she slid her robe a bit, enough to reveal her naked shoulders, beautiful enough to represent perfection. </p><p>I had seen her naked before, of course, but watching her slowly slip her robe enough to reveal her shoulders was even more beautiful. </p><p>Though, the fact that she had missed the easiest solution while she was busy dealing with the shock of the moment made the situation even more incredible. Her robe was creating an impediment, because it was designed to actually absorb her natural aura, therefore impeding my massage as well. </p><p>All she needed was to change into an ordinary robe, and it would allow the effect to occur without a problem. Yet, while I never doubted her intelligence — as the solution she developed to suppress her Light Spark with Darkness Spark was simply genius — but nothing that I saw about her showed quickness to solve ordinary problems. </p><p>How amusing. </p><p>I let my hands land on her naked shoulders, repeating the same effect, using the benefits of increased access for my benefit. “Actually, there’s a way to enhance the effects even more,” I said, and before she could even answer, I used Biomancy to conjure some massage oil, one that worked wonders to enhance the intensity of my touch. </p><p>She bit her lips as she turned toward me, her face contorted in shock,  but that was the limit of her reaction, because the oil also increased the effect of the light trick I was using. </p><p>Well, at least, that was what I was making it look like. I just increased the Tantric effect of the light a bit more, making it look like the conjured oil was helping to further focus the effect. </p><p>It only worked to increase the arousal she was feeling from my touch. My fingers danced between her neck and shoulders, occasionally even sliding forward enough to caress her collarbones. </p><p>The peak of my victory was a singular purr, barely audible, when I first touched her collarbone, the surprising rush of pleasure enough to break her determination to hide the effects. </p><p>Yet, that didn’t make her stop the process, not even ask me to slow down, even as the same resistance started to appear on her shoulders, significantly restricting the impact. </p><p>I could slowly feel her growing confusion, battling with the unfamiliar presence of pleasure, combined with her desire to ask me to undress her even further. </p><p>As always, I decided to be my usual helpful self and took the initiative to help her resolve her emotional conflict. </p><p>I gently grabbed her right arm, and started massaging her by slowly rubbing her hand, my fingers dancing on her naked skin as I slowly climbed up, revealing her delicate forearm, the dance of my fingers giving her a reprieve from the earlier rush. </p><p>For a given value, of course, as while her arm was certainly not as sensitive as her neck and shoulders, it was not without its own benefits as well. As my oil-covered fingers danced back and forth on her skin in a rhythmic pattern, her helpless squirms didn’t take long to return. </p><p>A sensation that increased even more as I rolled her sleeves and started caressing her upper arm, enjoying the beautiful contrast of her flawless skin and the hard muscles underneath. </p><p>Suggesting her preference for armor was not just a stylistic choice. Maybe one day I could ask her for a melee duel for some entertainment. </p><p>Ideally, one that would be followed by something even more entertaining. </p><p>Soon, I finished working on her arms, and returned to her shoulder, but not before fixing her arms. That helped her to calm down, which was a mistake, because the only reason I pushed her sleeves down was that, with them bunched, it would be much harder to push her robe down. </p><p>Then, I returned to her shoulder, once again intensifying the pleasure she was feeling. She stayed silent. Her only reaction was a twitch of her beautiful while wings while I resumed caressing the earlier areas. </p><p>But this time, that was not my limited starting point. My fingers started slipping lower and lower on her back. First, I danced on the edge created by her rolled robe, but that was just a start. With each repeat, I pushed her robe lower, until it was restricted by the little openings that she used to let her wings stay out. </p><p>Her deliberate silence as I pushed her robe was beautiful, but that was destroyed the moment I touched her wings. </p><p>“No!” she gasped in shock as she moved forward reflexively, though I didn’t miss the infection of her tone. It was a tone of desire, one that only happened when touching a particularly sensitive spot. </p><p>The sensitivity of her wings was shockingly interesting. </p><p>Yet, considering the nature of her tone was not the only thing I had done as she reflexively moved forward. If there was one advantage how high stats, was the enhanced reflexes it provided. </p><p>Those reflexes allowed me to grab her robe as she moved forward, and I pulled back. If that happened between two ordinary people, the worst that would happen was to turn a painful tug. </p><p>But between someone with my stats, and a supernatural being that was further enhanced by her incredible power, she magically enhanced robe didn’t have the slightest change, and ripped with a spectacular sound, not only leaving her back naked, but also forcing her to grab the front to prevent a spectacular cleavage from appearing. </p><p>“You need to be more careful,” I said in admonishment even as I pressed my hands on her back once again, this time pushing her forward, my fingers dancing along her spine as she found herself lying against her desk.</p><p>“But, since the accident already happened,” I added, not bothering to hide the huskiness of my tone.</p><p> —————</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 7334 / 7334 Mana: 9000 / 9000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Grandmaster Tantric [114/140]</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [85/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Titania - Level 35/38]</p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Marianne - Level 21/29]</p>",

    "content": "<p>The expression of shock on her face as I made my offer was beautiful, especially since I didn’t try to hide my aroused expression. </p><p>On the contrary, I made a deliberate effort on the other side, revealing a carefully-calibrated sense of arousal, enough for her to pick up. </p><p>There were several reasons for that. The first was to give her a simple way to control me, one that she expected me to show considering the disdain she showed toward this so-called Degenerate. </p><p>I also wanted to test how she would react to the implied suggestion once she received the solution to the problem that plagued her for centuries. Would that make her pull back to protect her purity? Would she overestimate the strength of her authority and try to order me to continue without changing anything? </p><p>It turned out that, even for a beautiful angel living in isolation, the temptation could get too much. I felt like a demon as her beautiful eyes glanced down accepting my offer wordless. Though the sudden movement of her wings, spreading to the side to allow my approach, was a rather more impressive display of her acceptance. </p><p>If it was another woman, I would have acted silly and teased her until I earned verbal acceptance, but I could see that for her, even that silent approval was pushing her limits. Just like my earlier touch to her hand showed, she was not exactly used to physical contact. </p><p>Despite what my naughty smile implied, I was rather conservative as I put my hands on her, slowly rubbing her shoulders as I infused her body with Tantric-infused Light mana, stretching my manipulation to the limit as I used the energies begging to be released as a destructive force as a gentle massage aid. </p><p>I radiated mana from across the whole surface of my hands, the process of absorption for her getting almost three times faster — and that was with her black robe, designed to block light mana. </p><p>Without that, the process would have been ten times the initial speed. </p><p>She didn’t seem to notice that fact, lost in the speed of transformation. Of course, with the speed I was displaying, it would have taken a long time to actually allow her to absorb all those Divine Spark. </p><p>Long enough to be measured in years if I worked on her full-time. </p><p>Yet, she didn’t seem to be particularly torn-up about the speed, not that I blamed her. After all, she had been dealing with that problem for a very, very long time, making even a decade a good solution. </p><p>Especially since her only other hope was the employer of Janelor somehow solving her problem — and considering Janelor confirmed that to be impossible later on. </p><p>I could have mentioned to her about the robe blocking the touch, and I had no doubt it would succeed, but I decided to create a little trick, one that would force her to take initiative. </p><p>What was more fun than seducing a pure angel who was far too used to her power and authority?</p><p>Tempting her to seduce me instead. </p><p>And, the first step of my campaign was a subtle one. I just let my finger drag along her neck, five minutes after I started working on her beautiful body.</p><p>A momentary contact, one that could be written off as accidental even by the most suspicious mind. She tensed, but I was getting familiar enough with her physical reactions — with my experience, five minutes was enough to get an excellent read on her reactions, especially since she was accepting a steady stream of mana into her body, which significantly enhanced the accuracy of the information I was collecting. </p><p>She tensed, because just as my finger brushed against her neck, I intensified the mana flow slightly as well, making sure she didn’t miss the sudden change in the impact. </p><p>As I went back to work on her shoulders, however, she said nothing. I might have assumed my initial ploy failed if it wasn’t for her tenseness, showing her inner turmoil as her initial patience was destroyed. </p><p>It was good to see the greed slowly digging its fingers into her psyche. After all, a decade to recover was an amazing period to recover after two centuries, especially for an angel with phenomenal longevity.</p><p>Yet, greed was an interesting sin, one that even an angel was clearly not free of. </p><p>Not that I wasn’t surprised. She wouldn’t have tried to absorb that Divine Spark in a desperate gambit to become a Goddess, even risking death in the process. </p><p>Not that I blamed her. It was clearly a good strategy, one that only foiled because of the subtle Divine Spark-based enchantment, carefully integrated into her existence to prevent that merger — my best guess, though unsupported, the God of Light, adding that to his angels, preventing them from replicating his feat. </p><p>Greed was not instantaneous like lust, or unyielding like pride. It was soft and insidious, like an itch. </p><p>And, unfortunately for her, waiting for it to slowly trigger her impatience was simply too delicious to be ignored. I continued with a steady pace, determinedly avoiding her neck. </p><p>Even as she shuffled a couple of times, subtly trying to direct my touch. But with each failure, the insidious touch of greed showed its head more. </p><p>“You’re not that bad when it comes to massaging,” she commented offhandedly, trying to casually lead the discussion. </p><p>Too bad for her that it was as stealthy as an explosive spell designed to take down castles, and the fact that it came after fifteen minutes of silence made it even more obvious. </p><p>“Yeah, it’s a fun way to help my allies relax after a long battle,” I said, once again playing coy as I said so, but without letting a suggestive pride from infecting my tone. </p><p>“It shows,” she said. It was a statement that was strictly against her personality, enough to make a big smile bloom on my face. Her voice still lacked arousal, of course. She was having trouble asking me to focus on her naked neck rather than her shoulder, which was already her limit. </p><p>Her current limit, at least. </p><p>I was quite enthusiastic about redefining those, but just as greed was a sin, patience was a virtue, one that I was determined to show under the circumstances. </p><p>It was the thematically-appropriate move to seduce an angel. </p><p>I continued my steady caresses, ignoring the obvious thread of conversation she was trying to convince me to pick, the change of pace certainly entertaining. </p><p>Though, she finally surrendered that attempt as I let my hands drag down to the middle of her back. “M-maybe you should stay focused on my shoulders,” she said, her voice hitching despite her best attempt to keep it steady. “M-maybe even climb up a bit more, focus on my neck.” </p><p>“Of course,” I said as I started working on her neck. “Although, I didn’t know that angels also had trouble on their back due to that problem.” </p><p>“That problem,” she asked, sounding lost. </p><p>“You know, big breasts,” I said, enjoying the sudden tenseness of her body. </p><p>“W-what do you mean,” she stammered in shock. “I have no such problem.” </p><p>“Oh, my mistake,” I said, quick to accept her explanation, but she stayed tense for a moment. Just as she was starting to relax under my touch, I let my hands drag down to her shoulder once more. “Then, there’s no point of focusing on your back so much,” I said. </p><p>“N-no, continue!” she said rapidly. “That’s better.” </p><p>All she needed was to tell me that the massage was helping to solve her problem, and she could have openly requested me to focus on her neck without making it weird. But that would also mean revealing that she needed me even more than she revealed through the storage creation process, meaning she had to cede even more power to me. </p><p>And, she was clearly unwilling to do so. </p><p>Unaware that she was only putting herself in a more tenuous situation by doing so. </p><p>“If you wish so,” I said, accepting her request, but using a tone that conveyed just how ridiculous I found her request. I brought both hands on her neck, letting my magic slowly infuse her skin and help her to fully merge with the Divine Spark. </p><p>As she did so, I was starting to get an even more accurate understanding of the merger process and what it included, and how wildly it differed from my process. At first, I had mistaken the process for simple absorption, but as the amount of Divine Spark under her full control increased, I could see that it was turning into a second layer of circulation, slowly spreading into her body, interacting with the free mana in her body in a surprising way. </p><p>Markedly more different than my blunt way of using Divine Spark, though I had no idea whether it was an option for purified Divine Spark in the first place. </p><p>Luckily, I had the opportunity to experiment properly.</p><p> —————</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 7334 / 7334 Mana: 9000 / 9000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Grandmaster Tantric [114/140]</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [85/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Titania - Level 35/38]</p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Marianne - Level 21/29]</p><p><br></p>",

    "content": "<p>After sending Ida upstairs, I found myself with nothing to do, so I started looking around, but there was nothing that was out of the ordinary downstairs. And, with the girls at the upstairs — and would clearly stay there a bit more — I had nothing to do. </p><p>It was not the most entertaining location to spend some time, but, imagining the potential treasure at the end of the rainbow was more than enough to stave off the boredom. </p><p>Though, they seemed to be determined to test my resistance against boredom, because it took almost half an hour for them to peek upstairs. </p><p>It was Irene, her red hair peeking through the corner. “Hi Chad, sorry about the … delay,” she said. “But after the … mishap…” she said, but her voice faded, her blush seemingly determined to compete with her hair. </p><p>“Oh, sweetie, it’s unfair to term it as a mishap, I enjoyed it immensely,” I answered playfully, which gave her blush the fuel it needed to finally surpass her hair color, while she folded into a comical display of geeky stuttering and stumbling over her words, yet unable to utter one complete sentence. </p><p>I had to admit, it was mean to put her on the spot, but considering they chose to keep me waiting half an hour without saying anything, some light revenge was not completely undeserved. </p><p>It took a while for her to recover, and even then, it was hard to classify her answer as a complete sentence. \"You … uh, no?!\" she stammered.</p><p>“Don’t worry about it, it’s just a little malfunction,” I said as I walked upstairs, feeling pity for her. Her usual eloquence — especially in the standards of their little group — had been successfully destroyed by her accident, enough to earn her mercy. “So, are you ready to start?” </p><p>“Y-yeah, we can start,” she stammered. She didn’t move as I stood up and started climbing the stairs, and, due to the way she stood, only after I climbed the stairs I managed to get a full view of her body. </p><p>Only to meet with a sight I wanted to classify as disappointing. She was still wearing the same armored pants she wore earlier, but the top was another armored set — and unfortunately, it resembled real armor rather than the sexy equivalent the women often wore during games or fantasy series. </p><p>At least, those were the ones I had the exposure to, not that I had a lot of time to spend on gaming. </p><p>I was tempted to tease her about the significant downgrade her costume suffered, but as I stood in front of her, she already looked like she wanted to collapse, so I let that slide. </p><p>“Let’s go,” I said. She started walking, and I followed her into a room that I assumed to be her bedroom… </p><p>Only to be shocked. It was more of a hobby room, but the nature of it surprised me. Two of the walls were covered with shelves end to end, one piled with enough books to make me fearful of its structural integrity, the other filled with an incredible number of figurines. </p><p>The third wall had a wardrobe instead, but just a glimpse was enough to show a gamut of irregular bright colors and weird shapes, enough to reveal there was not one ordinary item of clothing there. </p><p>“W-welcome to my nerd cave,” she stammered. </p><p>“W0w, impressive,” I said as I glanced around, and I wasn’t even being sarcastic. It might not be my hobby, but just a glance was enough to show just how seriously Irene was taking it. No wonder she was a part of their little nerdy group. </p><p>That flare of respect I felt for her commitment was a reason for me to change my plans. Not the ones that would end up in her bent against her shelves as I spanked her tight ass in a particularly sexy costume — preferably while Ida was doing her best to tease my balls — but the ones about just playing around while I helped her test her costumes. </p><p>Since she took that part seriously, it was only fair for me to take it seriously as well. </p><p>“Well, I know it’s childish but…” she started, only to be silenced as I pressed my finger on her lips. </p><p>“Nonsense, it’s your hobby, and it’s your right to take it as seriously as you want. Don’t listen to anyone else.”</p><p>“M-maybe,” she stammered as I pulled back, her face bright once again after my touch. When she started moving once again, I wasn’t surprised to see her dashing toward the wardrobe. After interacting with the rest of her group, I learned that their preferred way of dealing with shame was to lean toward their area of expertise aggressively. </p><p>After experiencing it again and again with Carrie and Naomi — and also Sarah, but to a lesser extent, as she was fueled more by her competitiveness than her obsession with a particular area of expertise — the exact same behavior wasn’t shocking to Irene. </p><p>There was a reason they were best friends, after all. </p><p>“Let’s start with something simple,” she said as she pulled a costume from the end of the wardrobe. “It’s the costume of General Leon, the secret Grand Duke of the Endless Plains…” she started explaining as she passed it to me. </p><p>I turned my attention to the costume, impressed by its structure. It was a simple costume, its style similar to hers in terms of armor, but both the metal plates — naturally made from plastic and painted rather than actually being forged from metal — and the fabric was jet black, giving it an edgy kind of cool. </p><p>As I examined it, Irene was giving me a detailed breakdown of the character, her explanation getting faster and faster as her explanation sped up, leaving me no hope to actually track it as the number of unknown words increased more and more, referring to the events and characters I had never heard before. </p><p>The only thing that I was able to understand was that the guy was a merciless general, his bloodlust only rivaled by his tactical acumen. </p><p>I waited for her to finish, but five minutes into her explanation with no hint of actually stopping, </p><p>“So, where can I change?” I asked, interrupting her. </p><p>“My bedroom should be—“ she started only to stop and correct herself. “No, Ida is still there, changing. Do you mind changing in the bathroom?” </p><p>“Not at all,” I said. “Where is it?” </p><p>“At the end of the corridor,” she said. </p><p>I nodded before turning and leaving. Yet, before I could reach the bathroom, I received a beautiful surprise. Ida stepped into the corridor. </p><p>I chuckled as I noticed her freezing like she was just caught doing something wrong. She had changed her costume, which was a pity, as the earlier skirt was simply excellent. </p><p>That didn’t mean her current costume was horrible. Not even close. It was just that her skirt was longer than the previous one. Not that it was a difficult achievement. It was impossible for a skirt to be shorter than that and still classified as a skirt. </p><p>Her current skirt wasn’t exactly modest. It was a mini skirt, one that was barely long enough to prevent her steps to be filled with the great danger of creating a show. Her skirt had the same fake-armor plates my costume had, but they were painted in bright silver rather than matte black. </p><p>Luckily, this time, her top was beautiful enough to compensate for the increased coverage of her skirt. It was a chainmail armor, but unlike what Irene was wearing, it was more similar to the depictions I had seen in-game posters, small enough to qualify as a bikini. </p><p>“Y-you’re here,” she stammered. </p><p>“Yes, I’m here,” I whispered back, unable to contain my smirk as I raised my costume. “I was just about to change. Is it a problem?” </p><p>“O-of course not,” she answered as she took a step to the side, pressing against the wall to allow me to pass. The corridor wasn’t small enough to make that necessary, but she still did that. </p><p>“Good,” I said as I took a step forward, passing her. I watched her from the corner of my eye, seeing her relax. </p><p>That was the moment I chose to move back, interrupting her mood shift. “But, before going to change…” I said as I pressed my arms on both sides, imprisoning her in place, making her beautiful eyes widen. “I need to ask one question. Did you follow my order properly?” </p><p>Her fragile expression was beautiful, alluring enough to tempt me to cut my ploy short and lean forward to steal a kiss instead. </p><p>Luckily, the earlier encounter with Naomi gave me the strength I needed to reject that temptation. Instead, I put my hand outside her naked thigh and started dragging it up slowly. </p><p>When my finger finally touched the fabric of her skirt, her breathing was already going out of control as she had just run a mile, getting even wilder as my finger continued to climb up. The more my finger climbed, the more of her beautiful legs it was revealing. </p><p>Yet, just before her beautiful core was revealed to my gaze, I stopped, my finger high on her waist, enough to confirm the absence of her underwear. “Good girl,” I whispered as I pulled back and continued to walk, leaving Ida behind. </p><p>I was starting to understand people’s fascination with cosplaying… </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Let’s move,” I said, walking toward the city gates just as Isolde’s implicit direction suggested. I decided against going to the palace for two reasons. The first was Cinder. While our training session worked wonders to integrate some obedience into her personality, I had no idea how effective it would be. </p><p>Worse, I had no idea how she would react to the presence of the others like Sapphire or Aria. </p><p>Even worse, she might decide to overcompensate by reacting even more explosively, which would have a mess. </p><p>However, that wasn’t the only reason for that direction. While I expected Cinder to react explosively, I trusted myself enough to control that as long as I prioritized that. </p><p>The more important reason was the transformation I had just gone through. I could feel my magic still dancing with uncharacteristic warmth, and I needed to train to make sure everything was working as it was supposed to. </p><p>And, the palace was hardly the destination to cut loose to test the new limits of his magic, especially as the nature that he gained was the fire. </p><p>Hardly the least dazzling type of magic. </p><p>We walked forward in total silence, bypassing both the gates of the inner city and the outer city with incredible ease — which didn’t fill me with a sense of security against upcoming threats. </p><p>And, since we weren’t speaking — Isolde was not a chatty person — I decided to use the opportunity to observe her as she moved through the city. </p><p>Her movement was a bundle of contradictions. In some aspects, she moved like an expert spy, unnoticed by anyone, yet other times, she almost gave a clumsy sensation. It was her background as a ranger, I realized soon after. She was an expert in going around unnoticed, but only in nature. </p><p>Cities had a different pattern, and required a completely different set of movements to hide properly, one that required to use of the crowds to hide effectively. Of course, her skill level was high enough that it didn’t matter much in the relatively easy task of escaping the city…</p><p>But if I gave her a task like sneaking into a well-defended manor, she would have no choice but kill the guards to do so.</p><p>I decided not to just focus on myself. After all, Isolde was an interesting person, simple, yet not stupid, just direct. And, more importantly, she had the natural skill to be a true assassin. </p><p>One that I lacked. </p><p>Just like I was a passable swordsman and a passable mage, I was also a passable assassin. Certainly good enough to deal with most targets, but only after bringing in a considerable number of tricks to the deal. </p><p>Most people didn’t know much about it, but assassination was an art, not too different from a painting. </p><p>And just like the painting, the lower tier was the street variety. Just like the portrait painters that jotted quick charcoal sketches didn’t deserve the title of artist, so did the street variety of artists. </p><p>It was common enough to be treated as a standard job, usually used in petty arguments. One or two bruisers, following the target until they carefully stepped into an alleyway, rushed before the target could notice their presence. </p><p>It didn’t work against anyone with the slightest awareness of their surroundings , of course, but even then, they were often sent. After all, it was a cheap measure, and a good way to warn an individual away from a certain course of action, or toward another. </p><p>And, they could always get lucky. </p><p>Naturally, assassins of that variety died as easily, with a frequency that matched their targets. </p><p>The second kind could be termed as artisans, the equivalent of painters that worked for noble houses, with the ability to create beautiful portraits of the noble members of the houses, or impressive landscapes. </p><p>It was a category that I belonged in. The assassins of this category were consummate professionals, and not only required hefty prices to start moving, but also seldom accepted any kind of time restriction. </p><p>After all, just like an expert painter needed to study their subject, from their personality to the light that surrounded them, so did an assassin. </p><p>They did so more carefully, as a painter’s failure didn’t come bundled with execution. </p><p>Well, not always. </p><p>The professional assassins observed the target, the habits, the guards that surrounded them if any — though any target that required action from such a professional either had a sufficient cadre of guards, or had skills strong enough to make the presence of guards moot — even their preferred type of wine. </p><p>There were many ways to hit a target, of course, from poisons to a dagger into the neck while sleeping… </p><p>Yet, there was also a third type of assassin, one that could see every single weakness surrounding an estate, with the ability to simply follow the rhythm of the guards until they breached the most well-defended sanctuary, or casually walk to the target and walk away in the middle of the street, and no one to notice the deed was done before the assassin disappeared. </p><p>Including the target. </p><p>It was the master painter equivalent of an assassin, the kind that appeared once or twice in each generation. </p><p>And, as I walked alongside Isolde, I could see glimpses of such talent. All that remained was for me to see whether I could extract that. </p><p>As we left the city behind us with a brisk walk, I continued to watch Isolde, taking note of her transformation as we arrived at the forest. Her occasional awkwardness had disappeared, replaced with wondrous ease as she moved through nature, melding with the background with shocking ease. </p><p>Since that trick was done without using any magic, it was even harder to detect. </p><p>“Where are we going?” she asked. </p><p>“One of my safehouses, of course,” I answered. </p><p>That earned a hesitant glare from her. “Are we going to abandon the Empire completely?” </p><p>My answer was a smirk. “Oh, sweetie, do you really think that my safe houses are only in darklands, or at the border,” I said. She was shocked at the statement, but as a woman of few words, she kept her mouth shut, and soon, we arrived at our destination. </p><p>And arrived at a beautiful meadow, surrounded by trees, and a small lake in the middle. </p><p>“Is this your safe house?” she asked, shocked. </p><p>I didn’t say anything, just raised my hand and used a spell, activating the ward stones that were buried in the ground. </p><p>“I … see,” she murmured, noticing the shimmering field. </p><p>Of course, even activated, those wards were barely more than paper, unable to resist a dedicated assault for more than a few seconds. But the strongest wasn’t always the safest. Considering the proximity to the capital, any serious wards would earn undue attention, and no ward could defend against the full strength of an army. </p><p>That didn’t mean that the wards were useless, of course. From the outside, they were designed to look like the wards most nobles used to cover their hunting grounds, marking it as a private area, but one with nothing in value. </p><p>Perfect area to conduct some training. </p><p>“Let’s work on you first,” I said as I looked at Isolde. “First, I need to see your basics.” With that, I raised my hand, and several blocks of ice appeared on the surface of the water. “Why don’t you go and show me your footwork first,” I said. </p><p>Isolde threw a dismissive glare at me, then turned her gaze to the little challenge I had given to her. </p><p>Still, her dissatisfaction wasn’t as strong as her obedience, and she walked toward there without even bothering to disagree. </p><p>I watched for a moment as she climbed the first floating piece of ice, then jumped to the next one before it could sink. The challenge was not as simple as it looked, as not only the floating ice was enough to lift her weight, but also the surface of it was slippery. </p><p>But, to someone like Isolde, it barely qualified as a warm-up. </p><p>Luckily, that was not the training I had designed for her in the first place. “Now, about the real training,” I said as I waved my hand, and certain words started to appear on the ice, such as maid, guard, and noble. </p><p>“What’s this?” she asked. </p><p>“I want you to do your best to replicate the attitude of the job that’s written there, and not jump to the next one before you’re convinced that you have succeeded,” I said </p><p>She looked frustrated at the sudden addition, clearly not understanding the reason for it. But she still did her best, and took a combative pose when the next piece of ice had said the guard. </p><p>I let her start with a task that was relatively simple. </p><p>She waited in that combative pose for a second before she jumped to the next ice, only for that ice to suddenly evaporate, and she fell into the lake. </p><p>Already floating in the air, there was nothing she could have done, and she fell into the water. “What the hell!” she gasped as she floated on top of the water, drenched. </p><p>It was a beautiful look. </p><p>“I might have forgotten to tell you. But if you can’t convince me with your posture, your footing will disappear.” </p><p>That didn’t exactly help her anger. “So, I looked like a guard,” she answered tersely. </p><p>“Imagine the way you looked. Your weapon raised, your body tense, ready to burst into action…” </p><p>“So, you told me to look like a guard.” </p><p>I smirked. “Try to imagine the guards you have seen, patrolling around the palace, or the ones that defended the city walls. How many of them displayed that alertness.” </p><p>“So, they are bad guards,” she said. </p><p>“No,” I answered with a smirk. “Lazy and bored is the default state of most of the guards, you need to replicate it efficiently to pass my test.” </p><p>Her expression of shock was beautiful. </p>",

    "content": "<p>The cheerleaders looked less enthusiastic about Megan’s sudden decision, but her reputation was set — especially after the debacle with Kevin destroying the reputation of one of their numbers — so they just accepted. The one that dressed as the knight dragged a chair to the center of the room, and the one that was dressed as the bishop pushed me on the chair. </p><p>And then, the last one, the cute half-Asian girl that was dressed as the pawn, pushed me down and sat on my lap without the slightest hesitance. </p><p>Megan just pulled a chair and sat in front of me, playing the cool girlfriend with a permissive smile on her face. Of course, I could easily read that her satisfied expression was paper thin, barely hiding her growing anger, but unfortunately for her, she had no other option but to play along. </p><p>When the alternative was being dumped by the new star of the team, she didn’t have many options. Still, she was lucky, as the current ploy worked well with our little photo adventure back on Monday, allowing her to lean even more into her new persona. </p><p>Then, the queen turned on the music and the cute pawn started rocking her hips, pulling my attention away from Megan’s woes. She was the one who unilaterally decided to change our agreement, so she was the one that needed to find the optimal strategy for him. </p><p>I wanted to focus on the cute pawn that was doing her best to wear out my pants out of existence as she rocked back and forth. </p><p>“Damn, someone is happy to see me,” she exclaimed as she felt my presence under her — which was already in full mast thanks to the presence of the six girls doing their best to awaken me.</p><p>“Well, honey, you deserve it after working so hard to keep our team happy,” I said as I leaned back, allowing her to rock back and forth easily.  </p><p>Pity that we were still in a public location, as I would have loved to show how much I appreciated her efforts properly. </p><p>Maybe for another victory. </p><p>Then, she started rocking back and forth, and after throwing another glance at Megan — whose gaze could kill despite the smile on her face — I turned my attention back to the cutie. “So, is touching forbidden at this club.” </p><p>“I don’t see a bouncer, do you?” she whispered as she grabbed my hands and brought them directly to her chest, allowing me to squeeze them. With her lingerie weak enough to be barely there, her tits might as well be naked under my touch. </p><p>“Well, I can see one,” I said loudly, which earned six earnest laughs, and one perfunctory one that suggested I would pay for that joke. </p><p>Yet, it was certainly worth it, even without the Intent that was flowing steadily as the rest of the party watched us through the window — albeit their view was limited due to the icy nature of the glass, only giving a blur of what was going on. </p><p>I grinned as I pulled my hands away, a move that easily snapped off her fragile top, leaving her even more naked. “Sorry, it was an accident,” I said as I threw the top to the side. </p><p>“I’m sure it was,” the cutie answered, but the sudden increase in her nudity didn’t hurt her pacing the slightest.  </p><p>Unfortunately, a song was too little to properly enjoy her presence. She looked like she wanted to stay. “The song is over,” Megan said, her voice chilly, which was enough to make her stand up — albeit slowly, leaning forward to highlight her small yet beautiful tits. </p><p>“Pity, it would have been fun,” she whispered longingly, only to be pulled away. Interestingly, it wasn’t Megan that pulled away, but the ‘unlucky’ girl that struggled to hide her body with that poor excuse of a rook costume, wearing only her panties and two pieces of paper with drawn bricks. </p><p>An exemplar sample of a Middle-Eastern beauty. </p><p>\"Oh shit,\" I muttered as the song changed, and instead of a club song, a rock song blasted in the room, showing she intended to finish what her friend started. </p><p>She followed the aggressive rhythm of her song without skipping a beat as she leaned forward, her tits pressing against mine. Technically, our naked skin didn’t connect, but considering it was only a thin piece of paper that was between our bodies, it was hard to argue that it counted. </p><p>I might not be a huge fan of stripping and lap dances — mostly due to their tendency to leave one hanging on the edge — it was hard to argue the combination of a rock song and a barely dressed olive-skinned beauty was an amazing achievement, especially since those pieces of paper that were supposed to protect her breasts slid away. </p><p>“The castle has fallen,” I whispered as I used the opportunity to grab her breasts, which was an even better sensation than the earlier pawn, my fingers already around her nipples. </p><p>Seduction Trait once again proved its usefulness as my fingers assaulted her breasts, allowing me to quickly identify her sensitive locations and make her moan beautifully as a result. Her back arched beautifully, giving me even better access to her breasts as I worked. </p><p>Unfortunately, just like before, the song that was playing was not endless, and soon, it reached the end, signaling that it was time for her to stand up. </p><p>She took a breath as she tried to recover after my short yet intense display of ability. When she recovered, she hugged me once more, and pressed her lips against my ear. “Damn, and here I was, hoping that little Asian girl was exaggerating about your size. Feel free to visit me whenever you got bored of that blonde bitch,” she whispered as she stood up, jumping softly on her feet to make her beautiful tits jiggle even more beautifully.</p><p>Megan threw her a glare, but unlike the previous girl, she matched that in an equal mood, showing she wasn’t as scared. </p><p>However, before I could focus on that potential catfight, the next song started, and the Latino beauty, representing the knight, walked in front of me. She didn’t sit down, but swayed in front of me slowly. The reason was not hard to guess, as a chainmail bikini looked spectacular, but it was hardly the most comfortable thing moving around. </p><p>Yet, while she might hate the restriction, it was hard to say she didn’t look gorgeous. The glistening metal was still thin enough to cling to her body beautifully, enhancing her seductive spins to a new level. And, she was clearly a better dancer than her friends, her moves contouring her body in interesting manners. </p><p>Yet, as she reached halfway to the song, it was clear that she didn’t appreciate the restriction of her underwear, and she showed that rather directly. She spun twice more before she pushed down her panties without a warning, revealing her glistening core. </p><p>Megan coughed pointedly, but my beautiful knight didn’t give Megan the attention she tried to command, busy splitting her legs to show off her flexibility to the limit, a move that fell right between athletic achievement and immense eroticism,. </p><p>I was torn between continuing to watch her amazing dance show and grabbing and pulling her on my lap to leverage her current half-naked state in a more interesting manner, when she stood in front of me, she back turned against me, as she started to lean back more and more. </p><p>Until her hands landed on the floor, showing the impressive extent of her flexibility. </p><p>“It looks uncomfortable, let me help,” I said as I leaned forward, and, a quick fiddling later, pulled her chainmail top free, leaving her completely naked. </p><p>“Thanks, you’re my hero,” she whispered seductively as she walked around me and stood behind me. She leaned forward, and warmth enveloped my neck, the source impossible to be mistaken. </p><p>Her hands landed on my body, slipping under my shirt, dancing along the lines of my muscles — ones that got noticeably sharper after the recent strength boost, but, thankfully, not enough to ship me to a lab. “Damn, that bitch is really lucky to move on as soon as you joined the team,” she whispered, echoing the words of her friends. </p><p>One that was too similar to the statements of the others to avoid my notice, making me wonder whether the show was something Thad arranged, or the cheerleaders let him think that to seduce me. </p><p>Not because of a sudden grand attraction, but because it was shameful for the cheerleaders not to have the newest star player on the team. </p><p>I barely held back a chuckle as the hands of the Latino beauty moved even lower, caressing along my length, amused just how far they were willing to go for their ephemeral understanding of the status and other expectations as well. </p><p>Luckily, I was decent enough looking with assets to match — not to mention sufficiently sharp eyes to see through their attempts of acting — so while their intent was not pure, their attraction was certainly genuine. </p><p>Thankfully, I thought as another song came to an end and the Latino beauty walked away in a naked strut, joining her other two half-naked friends. </p><p>It would have certainly damaged my little fragile ego otherwise.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Watching the ship arranged for me by Theodora starting to move away would have been worry-inducing if it wasn’t for the great physical boost my transformation gave me, allowing me to swim faster than the ship could move — at least while in shallow waters — to the point of making me wonder whether I could swim all the way across the sea rather than dealing with the ship. </p><p>Especially since I remembered how the beasts reacted to my presence, not just the domestic animals like horses, but also the magical beasts, Nemean Lion being one example. If the creatures in the sea reacted in a similar manner, such an achievement might be even more reasonable. </p><p>I might have even attempted that if it wasn’t for my beautiful ally on my back. Her weight was not a problem, but her unconscious state certainly was, especially since I didn’t know how long this state would last after her exertion. Best case, she would wake up in a few hours. </p><p>Worst case, a few weeks. </p><p>And trying to balance an unconscious person on my back while swimming on open seas was not an attractive option compared to a ship, even an unknown one. I continued to swim, each length bringing me forward a shocking amount, allowing me to cut through the surface of the water, which was still rough after the recent surprise storm. </p><p>I did my best to ignore the source of that storm, along with the fatalistic realization that just how close I had been to death, teaching me that, even after I learned how to use my most recent power up, I was not a peak existence in the world. </p><p>Nowhere near close. </p><p>I was still a sorcerer, one with the strength and confidence to fight and win against several sorcerers once I managed to get decent control of my power, but that didn’t change the fact that the power that I felt earlier surpassed that point in an incomprehensible degree. </p><p>It wasn’t just about the magical strength, but the way they utilized it… </p><p>“Luckily, it doesn’t come for free,” I murmured even as I remembered the conceptual chains that locked down the casters, showing that such a power didn’t come freely. If it wasn’t for my own unusual ascendancy experience, I might have assumed that it was being cast by the other six beings — the Archmagus as Xia called — to restrain the newcomer, a conclusion that would have been supported by their positioning. </p><p>I didn’t think so, because I was familiar with the semi-sentient nature of the elements, far more than a sorcerer was supposed to due to unusual circumstances of my own Ascendance. And, if the four elements of Earth could rebel against my control, them restricting Archmagus was certainly not unbelievable. </p><p>A process that was conveniently confirmed by my expanded senses. </p><p>Still, it was a great lesson about arrogance. I sighed even as I started to swim, though a frown appeared on my face as I noticed the speed of the ship, faster than I expected. It didn’t take long for me to recognize layers of runic enhancements buried deep into its hull as I expanded my magical senses, but recognizing the reason was the only start of my problem. </p><p>Almost all ships had runic enhancements, both to expand their speed, and to increase their defensive capabilities in case of a beast attack. While the seas were much safer than the open ocean, where disasters beast filled the place to the brim, making any voyage an impossible affair, some danger still existed. </p><p>Yet, the level of runic enhancements on the ship was different, similar to the difference between a dagger carried for safety, and wearing a full set of legionnaire armor and weapon set. The ship could easily rival — maybe even surpass — some of the premier warships of the fleet. </p><p>It wasn’t fully apparent at a glance as they were still running well below the maximum capacity, but that only made the situation more suspicious. </p><p>If it wasn’t for the great danger the mainland represented, I would have turned and swam back to the shore, searching for a more viable option. If Xia wasn’t unconscious, I would have swam deeper into the sea, searching for another ship I could sneak in. </p><p>With the situation forcing my hand, despite the nature of the ship, raising many red flags, I continued to swim toward it. Though, I did one thing differently, and did my best to stay under the waves — which was much more challenging with the necessity of keeping Xia’s head above water, preventing her from drowning. </p><p>It was supposed to be a difficult affair to get closer to a ship on the open sea, but luckily, the earlier show of the brand new Archmagus from House Junia worked to my benefit for that purpose. The ship was running through emergency drills, focusing to gather its power to the limit. </p><p>They were too occupied with their tasks to actually pay attention to the sea, though the intensity of their activity surprised me, the captain roaring order after order, his voice sharp and intense. The power radiating from the captain, clearly marking him as a sorcerer, would have made the situation more understandable — as he clearly felt the immensity of the power, a nuance a normal mage would have likely failed — but even then, his tone was too even, packing any kind of panic and surprise. </p><p>My new senses allowed me to feel his fear, but it was too measured, too contained, to be the fear of the unknown. As if he was also aware that an Archmagus was restricted from acting. A suspicious level of knowledge considering I didn’t find anything about the subject even after raiding Patrician Libraries. </p><p>The ship I picked as a destination was clearly more complicated than I had expected, but that didn’t make me turn back. Armed with my transformation, and a patrician weapon I could use, even without my magic, I trusted myself enough to contend against a sorcerer enough to go back to the sea. </p><p>I expanded my senses, examining the layout of the ship wards, wards that were in the process of being activated along with the other runic schemes of the ship, which meant there were several great gaps along its detection surface. </p><p>Gaps that I easily ignored as I let my hands into claws, easily climbing to the side of the ship, the runes that were supposed to resist such an attempt fizzling under my touch. </p><p>“Check the side, some of the runes went off,” shouted someone, but I was quick enough to finish my destination before one could pay a glance. </p><p>My destination, a little hatch on the side, was closed by a wooden board that looked like a part of the ship, but a careful examination revealed that it was a wooden window. Even better, my enhanced sense of smell showed that the room behind was currently empty. </p><p>Without my sense of smell, I wouldn’t dare to enter there, because the room was warded several times, enough to conceal its contents even from my magical senses, and did so in a way that would avoid the attention of many others. </p><p>Supremely suspicious. </p><p>A poke of my hand was enough to destroy the rune that was holding it closed, and I slipped in. As I let it close, I heard a voice shouting. “The side is clear, but some of the runes are burned. Someone screwed up their part of the activation,” shouted the sailor tasked to catch me. </p><p>I shook my head in amusement. I had deliberately destroyed more runes than necessary to give that exact impression, but seeing a simple subterfuge working was certainly good news. </p><p>Yet, my good mood didn’t even survive until I placed the Xia down. The little room — more accurately defined as a full lower deck — was dark, almost pitch black, and the wards strong enough to block my magical senses did nothing to help my sudden sense of discomfort. </p><p>At least, blocking what I could feel from outside. Since I was inside the wards, I could feel the magical objects inside the wards. And I felt many different magical items, giving the impression of weapons. </p><p>I let my transformation spread once more, this time targeting my eyes, and just like that, the darkness turned into something much more manageable. </p><p>However, regaining the ability to see didn’t help much to contain my growing discomfort, as I realized I was in an armory, one that filled the deck from side to side. </p><p>The first thing I noticed was ballistas, a dozen in total, six on each side, the closest one directly in front of me. Their existence was probably responsible for the disguised hatches on the side. Ordinary ballistas were hardly an object for fear, but the one in front of me, every inch covered in silver runes to reinforce its structure, was hardly an ordinary weapon. </p><p>And the bolts that were stacked next to it, even more, intense magically, were even more suspect. Just one hit would take down an ordinary ward, and a volley or two would take down any ward a sorcerer could erect without the assistance of external items. </p><p>While a dozen ballistas were the most striking weapon in the warded secret deck, they were hardly the only weapon in the hold. A rack on the left was filled with spears, while an opposing rack was filled with a crossbow, their power and quality too uniform to be acquired by a trading ship, no matter how successful. </p><p>Theodora owed me an explanation, a long one. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“And, this is the little boat I rented,” I said as I gestured at the forty-two feet beautiful catamaran I had hired. It wouldn’t have been cheap, if I hadn’t had a small talk with the hotel manager, and he allowed me to ‘borrow’ it for free for a couple of days for holding such a big company event in their hotel. </p><p>A nice kickback. </p><p>“It’s beautiful, sir,” Charlie said, but I could hear the sense of defeat in his tone, no doubt thinking that Brenda wouldn’t pay attention to him now that her gaze was captured by luxury. </p><p>I gestured at Brenda to drag him away. “Amazing, now you can teach me how to swim properly,” Brenda said to him as she grabbed his arm and dragged him into the boat. </p><p>Charlie was caught flatfooted by Brenda’s action. His attitude made it clear that he had been one of the shy students that were more focused on his classes than the girls, and as a consequence, he didn’t know how to handle when he was being flirted with aggressively. </p><p>To the point of momentarily forgetting that he was being accompanied by his beautiful yet demure fiancee, who was shy enough to prevent her from starting to shout at him. </p><p>“Let me help,” I said as I stood at the small board that led the ship, presenting my hand. Umi looked hesitant at first. Not because she needed to grab my hand — which was nothing compared to everything that we had already done. </p><p>“It feels familiar,” she murmured, looking at me with suspicion. Understandable, as while the environment was different — a boat under the sun, versus a concealed restaurant booth — the implication was the same. </p><p>Smart girl, I decided as I noticed her alert expression. Unfortunately, that alertness only survived until beautiful laughter exploded from the other end of the boat. “Stop, you’re too bad,” Brenda said, the flirtatious intent in her tone enough to conjure a steamy scene. </p><p>Helped by the fact that they were already on the deck of the ship, which prevented Umi from seeing what was going on. </p><p>Umi said nothing, just grabbed my hand, and allowed me to pull her on the boat, ignoring the fact that I pulled her against my body enough to feel her curves against mine. </p><p>That didn’t even earn a comment as she started climbing the small stairs that led to the main deck, her feet stomping on the floor with a strength that surprised me coming from such a petite beauty. </p><p>I followed, only to see Brenda fixing the bottom of her bikini the moment we arrived at the deck. Charlie’s back was against us, so he didn’t see the sudden anger on his fiancee’s face, especially after a flicker of fear passed Brenda’s face, like she had been just caught. </p><p>Of course, it was just another trick from Brenda, her fake fear suggesting that Umi had just missed a naughty moment Brenda shared with Umi’s fiancee. </p><p>A beautiful way to trigger her jealously, especially when Umi lacked the attitude to react against it, leaving Charlie oblivious of the trick that had been just pulled at his expense. </p><p>“Why don’t you stay at the deck while I handle the boring part,” I said with a chuckle and started walking toward the bridge — albeit a bit grand for a small luxury boat. </p><p>“W-wait, where’s the captain,” asked Charlie, looking startled. </p><p>“Don’t worry, boy. I have been a captain for the last two decades. Of course, feel free to leave if you’re afraid.” </p><p>Charlie panicked, realizing that he had inadvertently insulted the boss he was trying to suck up in the first place. “Of course, he’s not afraid,” Brenda defended before Charlie could say anything, even putting her hand on Charlie’s shoulder, earning an appreciative smile from him. </p><p>Yet, in his emotional rollercoaster, he didn’t even notice the angry gaze of his fiancee. </p><p>I gave a subtle nod at Brenda, suggesting that she was going an excellent job at the task I had given her. “Alright, then. Have fun at the deck,” I said as I walked to the bridge, leaving the three at the desk. </p><p>For the next half an hour, I split my attention between steering the boat — which was an easy challenge in the open sea and perfect weather — and watching the three frolic on the deck, which was visible from where I was standing. </p><p>On the contrary, they were unaware that I was watching them, because the bridge windows were tinted aggressively, enough for them not to have a clue about what was going on inside. </p><p>It didn’t have a great benefit at the moment, but I could easily imagine many benefits of such a situation. </p><p>Three of them stayed at the deck, with Umi’s expression getting stormier by the second as she watched her fiancee captivated by Brenda, who was monopolizing his attention under the guise of learning how to swim. </p><p>Interestingly, the more he spoke, the more he was getting lost, his expression serious as he waved his arm, again and again, suggesting that he was giving a very technical explanation about the best way to swim. </p><p>I couldn’t help but smirk as I noticed boredom slowly growing in Brenda’s expression, hidden behind her convincingly-fake expression of interest. </p><p>At least, convincing enough to fuel Umi’s frustrations further. Her personality didn’t allow her to air her frustration, so she started looking for a reason for that. Soon, she gazed down, checking her boring one-piece before examining Brenda’s loose bikini which looked ready to snap whenever she made a big move. </p><p>She was blaming her outfit, which, considering that it was an objectively terrible outfit, was justified. It would have lost against any random person on the beach, and against Brenda’s carefully-chosen outfit, any comparison was just cruelty. </p><p>It was tragic, as Umi certainly had the assets to compete against Brenda. They were just hidden behind her horrible selection. </p><p>As I watched, Umi’s expression was turning from just stormy into a hurricane that was about to explode, finally overcoming her usual hesitancy. </p><p>I decided to stop the boat and walk to the deck at that moment. I didn’t want that hurricane to explode, because doing so would release all the frustration Umi silently collected.  </p><p>And, I had much more interesting plans for that frustration. </p><p>“Amazing view, right?” I said as I walked into the deck, still wearing a t-shirt — one that was necessary for me to maintain my harmless aura. </p><p>“It definitely is,” Brenda said as she lay on the deck and stretched playfully, the sun reflecting on her back. </p><p>“So, who’s feeling thirsty?” I said as I walked toward the small bar on the deck, one that was being neglected. </p><p>“Me,” Brenda said as she walked to the bar as well, her hips swaying amazingly as she did so. </p><p>“Isn’t it a bit early,” Charlie murmured, but that was all he did when Brenda turned to him with a seductive smile. </p><p>“I don’t think so,” Umi murmured, tense, but lacking the ability to convey that annoyance with her words. She certainly needed a drink. </p><p>Too bad for her that the cocktail I mixed for her barely had any alcohol in it. I wanted her to stay sober, with no excuse for her next actions. The one I mixed for Brenda was much better, but even that was nothing compared to the one I prepared for Charlie. </p><p>“Gah,” he gasped as he took a sip, his eyes widened. </p><p>“I can make something lighter if you can’t handle a proper cocktail,” I said, deliberately smirking smugly in a way a young man might when he thought himself superior. </p><p>With Brenda looking at him from the side, there was no chance of him rejecting that challenge. “No need,” he said as he took a large sip, unaware that the cocktail was even harder than he had expected, most of the bitterness concealed by a careful application of excess sugar. </p><p>I want Umi sober, but the same didn’t apply to his fiancee. The more his decision-making was impaired, the better. </p><p>And, thanks to a combination of sugar, sun, and alcohol, I expected that to happen soon. Then, Brenda showed her unique brand of intelligence, and started goading Charlie for drinking even more. </p><p>“I love a guy that can hold his drink,” she murmured as she put her hand on his shoulder, caressing suggestively. I might have pitied him under Brenda’s well-manicured yet merciless claws, knowing that despite all the teasing he was suspected of, it was all he would receive… Poor guy was clearly unused to the attention of the kind of predatory woman Brenda belonged to, with problems of sucking a guy to the bone metaphorically once they sensed a hint of weakness… </p><p>I would have pitied him if he wasn’t weak enough to fall for that ploy under the angry gaze of his beautiful fiancee, watching him angrily. </p><p>I watched him finish the first one quickly before I prepared another cocktail for her, this time even stronger, amused by the way his face scrunched as he took a sip, but held his complaints back to impress Brenda. </p><p>“So, Umi, don’t you feel big stuffy in that horrible piece,” I asked. “Maybe you should change into a bikini as well.” </p><p>That finally reminded Charlie that he was there with his fiancee, his eyes widening slightly at the suggestion. Yet, that was the limit of his interaction — which was understandable, considering he was still under the impression that nothing but some innocent flirting happened to humor an old yet inept boss. </p><p>How amusing. </p><p>Umi looked like she wanted to reject, but Charlie’s lack of complaint was already enough to anger her. “I would, but I don’t have a spare,” she answered. </p><p>“Don’t worry, there are some spare ones in the bedroom. Let me show you,” I said. </p><p>That finally clued Charlie, the sudden panic on his face suggesting realization. Yet, that was short-lived when Brenda grabbed his arm and dragged him toward the side of the boat, where there was a small ladder to allow them to climb down. “That’s enough theory, now, you’re going to show me how to swim,” Brenda said, dragging him away. </p><p>Leaving me alone with Umi on the deck.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

    "content": "<p>After Naomi’s surprising — though, ultimately unsuccessful — attempt to dissuade me from visiting Irene, I expected Sarah to attempt that exact same thing as well, but, interestingly, she chose to stay away. </p><p>I couldn’t help but wonder about the reason even as I drove toward Irene’s house with my bike, enjoying the wind on my body as I drove through the empty streets, the engine growling aggressively under me. </p><p>It might be a little risky, but that didn’t make it any less enjoyable. </p><p>The door opened the moment I entered the driveway. I expected Irene to be there, but it was Ida. </p><p>I was glad that I had been wearing my helmet, because the moment I took note of how she dressed, my eyes widened in shock. </p><p>Ida was wearing a colorful skirt, one that could be easily leveraged for other purposes, like a belt, or a bandana. It technically managed to cover her hips, but only because she was absolutely motionless, and there was no wind. </p><p>Most of her legs were covered with the thigh-high boots she was wearing, though they were a garish, bright red. Her crop top was modest, but only compared to the great, permanent danger her skirt provided. It had nice cleavage, enough to reveal that while Ida’s busts were not enough to compete with Carrie or Naomi, she could easily compete with Sarah. </p><p>With her thin stature, it looked even more impressive. </p><p>Her ensemble was complete with some kind of scarf around her neck, tied like a choker, with a lot of complicated lines. </p><p>Her ensemble looked roughly familiar to me, though it took a while to remember the source, one of the cartoons that played on the TV in the mornings, though it was barely an impression. I had never been one to enjoy cartoons. </p><p>Though, looking at Ida, maybe it was wrong for me to write them off as childish, if the benefits included the view in front of me. </p><p>Yet, I wasn’t the only one that was feeling shocked. My slightly widened gaze was nothing compared to the shocked look Ida wore on her face as I stepped down and removed my helmet. </p><p>It wasn’t too hard to understand the reason for her shock. </p><p>At the school, I dressed for invisibility, doing my best to maintain an ignoble aura to avoid the pointless distraction of school life — the current entanglement with my little group of nerds none-withstanding. </p><p>It was greatly different than my current bad boy looks, fitting jeans, a tight leather jacket and an even tighter t-shirt underneath to give a full map of my muscles.</p><p>A great departure from my state of invisibility. </p><p>Of course, thanks to Naomi’s loose lips, Ida already knew that my school attitude was just a facade, but there was a great difference between stories and reality. </p><p>I couldn’t help but smirk in amusement as I walked closer to her, each step making Ida tremble a little more, as if the closing distance reminded her of the reality of what she had signed for by volunteering to join the ploy.</p><p>Her gaze reminded me of Carrie, back when I had offered her the first exploration of her sensual side in the car, on a fateful weekday evening; afraid of what was to come, yet too curious to stay away, just like a beautiful butterfly drawn to a flame.  </p><p>She had the option to retreat, yet chose not to. “W-welcome,” she said, unable to prevent a shy stammer in her tone as I walked in. </p><p>“I hope I’m not late,” I asked. </p><p>“No, we were just starting,” she answered. </p><p>I didn’t answer that immediately. First, I lowered my gaze, then gave a very slow, sensual assessment of the way she dressed even as she shuffled uncomfortably. “Hmm, if this is just starting, I couldn’t wait for the main event,” I answered. </p><p>“R-right, come in,” she stammered before she turned her back and beat a hasty retreat — which was hardly the correct choice with her skirt, as she plied skirt rose to give me a beautiful glimpse of her underwear for an extended moment, which was surprisingly tiny, revealing most of her pale cheeks without impediment. </p><p>A very promising start to the evening, I decided even as I followed Ida inside. Yet, my surprises were not limited to that. Before I could take more than a couple steps inside, Irene appeared on top of the stairs, wearing some kind of complicated, armored pants that looked like it was part of a set. It was nothing compared to Ida’s beautiful micro skirt. </p><p>But Irene managed to compensate for that, because those pants were the only thing that she was wearing, leaving her top completely naked, her breasts jumping to motion as she came to a sudden stop. “Ida, did you see—“ she started, only to freeze as she registered my presence. A shocked gasp later, she run back panicked, and disappeared. </p><p>Ida threw a hesitant glare back at me, and seeing my naughty smirk, she started running up. I wanted to see her running the stairs, confident that she would forget just how amazing of a show she would provide me as she did so. </p><p>But, I had higher ambitions for it, especially since, unlike Irene, she had already learned from Naomi what awaited her on this evening adventure, yet still chose to hang around. So, before she could take her second step, I grabbed her wrist and prevented her retreat. </p><p>“There’s no hurry for you to help her,” I said, enjoying her widened gaze under my touch. </p><p>“But…” she whispered, but despite her growing panic, she didn’t try to get away. </p><p>I was planning to start our game slowly, but since Irene’s accidental flashing already set the scene,  adding to the fact that Ida had joined intentionally despite knowing the ultimate ending of Naomi’s visit — at least some of it, as I doubted Naomi explained every little detail with their little scuffle with Sarah — I decided to take a risk. </p><p>“So, I’m guessing you talked with Naomi?” I asked, enjoying the shock growing on her face as I challenged her openly. I stopped grabbing her arm, but other than a hesitant step she took backward, she didn’t move. </p><p>“W-what do you mean?” she asked, her panic growing. “S-she is my friend, of course, I talked with her. We talk a lot. There’s nothing wrong with that.” </p><p>I smirked, enjoying the way she folded rapidly under the weight of the moment, babbling without a direction as she tried to recover from her shock, only to push even deeper. </p><p>“I didn’t say that there’s anything wrong with that,” I said as I took a step forward, and she took two steps back — which, considering the height difference between us, was more or less equaled the same distance. </p><p>Amused, I took another step forward, but this time, she took only one step, because before she could take the second one, she found herself pressing against the couch, imprisoning her in place. </p><p>“So…” I said, my voice radiating smugness.  </p><p>“So, what…” she whispered back, her voice barely audible. </p><p>“Nothing much,” I said. “I was just feeling curious about just how much detail she had delivered a particular part of our adventures.” As I spoke slowly, her shock continued to grow steadily. </p><p>“W-what part,” she stammered. Her attempt to deny it was not a bad strategy. Too bad that her shocked expression didn’t leave even the slightest doubt about whether or not she had understood my not-so-hidden implications. </p><p>“Come on, Ida, you’re a smart girl. I’m sure you’re very much aware of what part I was talking about. Isn’t that right?” </p><p>“M-maybe,” she started before she steeled her expression. “A-actually, no!” she corrected her words a second later, her expression steeling for a moment. </p><p>Too bad that sudden courage shattered immediately the moment I touched her chin. “Are you saying that, a beautiful and smart girl like you don’t have the slightest idea what I’m talking about?” </p><p>“M-maybe,” she stammered again, but this time, her expression weakened even further. “Well, yes,” she admitted, surrendering. </p><p>“Excellent,” I whispered as I leaned forward, bringing my lips closer to her face, separated just by an inch, but not actually kissing her. “Then, are you ready for the next question?” She didn’t answer that, but her expression shouted she was certainly not even close to that point. </p><p>I still asked. </p><p>“Do you want to experience the same adventure?” I asked. </p><p>She didn’t say anything, just nodded hesitantly. While her nod was hesitant, her body was more honest. Her chest pushed out to enhance her cleavage, while her legs parted invitingly. </p><p>I had no doubt that, if I chose to push forward at that moment, I would get my victory. </p><p>Too bad that doing so would mean missing the opportunity to complete both stages of the plan at once. </p><p>“Excellent. Then, it should be acceptable for me to test your willingness, right?” I said. She nodded again, dazed. “Give me your panties.” </p><p>That was enough to break through her daze. “W-what?” she stammered. </p><p>“It should be simple enough,” I said. “Give me your panties right now if you want to experience the same ecstasy Naomi had enjoyed.” </p><p>“But—“ she started, but I put my finger on her lips. </p><p>“No buts,” I said as I opened my hand. “Give me your panties, or you’ll just watch while I ask Irene the same question. But maybe it would be enough to watch, right?” </p><p>Her expression of conflict was beautiful, but not as beautiful as the speed with her hands disappearing under her skirt and started dragging down her panties, abandoning their protection — which was rather essential with the skirt she was wearing. </p><p>I took a step back once she passed them to me. “See, was that so hard,” I whispered throatily. “Now, you can go and talk with your friend. You shouldn’t neglect her after she experienced such a harrowing mistake,” I said. </p><p>The sudden change of pace didn’t lessen her shock, but she was obedient as she started climbing the stairs. Her hands were locked tight around her skirt to prevent any accidental reveal, tempting me to ask her to move faster just to get a glimpse. </p><p>Yet, I let her climb unimpeded until she arrived at the top of the stairs. Only then I chose to speak. “Also, you’re not allowed to put any for the rest of the night,” I ordered. </p><p>The whimper she let out as she disappeared was simply spectacular… </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

    "content": "<p>“Be careful,” she murmured as I grabbed her hand. Her voice was steady, but it was impossible for her to hide her tenseness from me successfully. </p><p>“Don’t worry, boss,” I said, putting enough focus on the last word, enough to make it a mocking statement. Any other time, she would have reacted that badly, but this time, she didn’t even notice that, her attention on my fingers. </p><p>It was not hard to understand her. I was yet to learn the full details, but it was clear that she had spent a considerable portion of the last two centuries locked in the tower, and even the possibility of getting free from that was not so inconsiderable. </p><p>I was careful as I used Tantric to slowly imbue Arcana energy in a manner subtle enough that she wouldn’t notice, and started building a temporary container in her finger, paying attention to do so extra stable. </p><p>I considered deliberately failing a couple times before succeeding to further undersell my abilities. I would have probably done so without the presence of the princess and Janelor, their presence giving me a sense of pressure. </p><p>Both were enemies of the Eternals to a certain degree, though even without them, it was clear that the Eternals weren’t exactly a friendly organization, evidenced by the way they tried to use Zokras to take the school down. </p><p>After I completed it, she started circling her mana, once again using her clumsy mana flow to store Divine Spark into the storage, not too different from the way she used to create my Light node. </p><p>I would have been annoyed, if it didn’t give me even more chance to steal Divine Spark. </p><p>Most of the Divine Spark I stole, I just pushed into my body, cleansing through Tantric before letting my body absorb it — since the effectiveness of it helping me to level up getting lower and lower, I decided to prioritize absorption over letting the System devour it. </p><p>The next time, I would try to steal some from the Princess, to see whether the difference in Divine Spark would help. </p><p>The process took a long, and the waiting after that took even longer, so I decided to leverage the pause for something productive. I already had my mana inside her, and she was conveniently distracted to examine the performance of the storage I created. </p><p>Perfect time for some experimentation. </p><p>I started to examine the relationship between the Divine Spark and her body, to see why she was failing to absorb it. </p><p>As I carefully examined her state, I soon realized that was not entirely correct. The best way to describe her status was halfway successful — as otherwise, she would have long died due to side effects regardless of the impact. </p><p>Though, the deeper I dug, the more I respected her solution. The simplest way to describe her trick was to create a giant Light Node for herself, compressing most of the Light Spark into an immobile mess, allowing her to survive despite a half-complete process. </p><p>Of course, the actuality wasn’t as simple, as the Divine Spark was clearly resisting being compressed to such a degree, so she couldn’t just compress the Spark completely and continue to use her mana. </p><p>She had to maintain a subtle balance of letting it liquify to get rid of the pressure, circling through her body before solidifying it into a node once more —  while using Darkness Spark to suppress the process. </p><p>All the while, the way she had used the spark was diametrically opposed to mine, as even halfway successful, it was clear that she wanted to let it dance in her body freely. My trick was far more similar to Janelor’s trick, though using transformed Divine Spark rather than Mana.  </p><p>I didn’t attempt to steal the Darkness Spark, as unlike the abundance of Light Spark she was suffering, she clearly had much less, enough that the disappearance of it might actually be successful. </p><p>Curious, I created a very small probe of pure mana, one that displayed the full capability of Tantric Node.</p><p>As I did so, I could feel my competency in Tantric rising, but I received no notification from the System, the partial block working excellently. </p><p>[-14 Mana]</p><p>The transformation itself might be complete, but the amount of mana was small enough to avoid her attention, especially with the presence of the other, and I watched the process as it moved through her body. </p><p>It didn’t take long for me to notice something very important. It occasionally collided with slivers of Light Spark, only for them to disappear almost immediately. At first, it made me frown, as while Tantric was able to purify the Divine Spark, it was certainly not an instantaneous process, not even for a sliver. </p><p>I turned my full focus into the process. I realized what was going on at the fifth occurrence. </p><p>Before I could absorb Light Divine Spark, I needed to purify it completely, stripping it of its nature — or transforming it into Tantric nature, but that was not a question I was yet to answer — before my body could accept it. </p><p>Yet, the same didn’t apply to the headmistress, who was already halfway merged with Light Spark, with their nature mostly aligned. A simple touch of Tantric effect was enough to soften the rigidity of the Divine Spark, which then allowed it to merge with her properly. </p><p>As it merged with her, I understood why she was having trouble describing the interaction between Divine Spark and the gods. It directly merged into her body just like my featureless Divine Spark did, but unlike my featureless one, it also imposed its nature on the Headmistress, enhancing the nature of her light more. </p><p>It was a subtle change, impossible to notice if I hadn’t been looking for it deliberately, but impressive nonetheless. I couldn’t imagine how it would look once it was completed fully. </p><p>The best part, since it would fully merge with her, it would be protected from the absorption of the system as well. </p><p>I smiled at the process. I was certainly afraid of showing my ability to purify Divine Spark even with our growing relationship. But giving that little, almost indiscernible push to complete her half-completed merging was much less spectacular. </p><p>One that could be easily dismissed as a coincidence, just like she did the ability of the storage I created to hold Divine Spark. </p><p>Being underestimated was certainly useful. </p><p>There was no time like now, I decided as I tightened my hold over her hand, and pressed my finger to her palm, slowly infusing light energy that was infused with Tantric as I caressed her palm. </p><p>I barely held a chuckle as I used the extremely destructive light energy as a massaging aid. It was not necessary to do so. On the contrary, using healing energy or pure mana would have been more useful, and easier. </p><p>Using the destructive and aggressive nature of the Light mana as a massage aid, on the other hand, was considerably challenging. Even with my stats and magical competence, I doubted I could have achieved without Tantric’s assistance, which was, for the lack of a better term, softening the Light, making it gentler and more obedient. </p><p>“What are you doing?” the headmistress asked, quick to question as she looked at me, though it took a moment for her to react as she was still distracted by the monumental nature of my earlier achievement.</p><p>“Helping to fight against tenseness, just in case the storage somehow blocks your mana flow,” I said. “Why, is it not working?” </p><p>“That’s not what —“ she started, only for her eyes to widen, as she doubtlessly noticed a sliver being absorbed in her body. Her shock was palpable enough that even she had no hope of hiding, so I reacted. </p><p>“Should I stop?” I asked as I slowly pulled back my mana.</p><p>“No!” she gasped, making by far the loudest voice I heard her making, not that I begrudged her for it. After all, what just happened represented a solution that plagued her for centuries. </p><p>“Are you sure?” I asked, acting shocked at her sudden reaction. “You don’t have to lie to protect my feelings, I can handle it,” I said, letting my smile widen. </p><p>“I’m s-sure, continue,” she said, her face blushing in excitement, her breathing fast, once again highlighting just how cute her flawless face could be while showing emotions.  </p><p>“Why did you react that way, then?” I asked, enjoying pushing her once again. </p><p>“I…” she muttered a bit, lost at the moment as she tried to find an excuse for her explosive reaction. “I was just surprised at your competency at manipulating Light. It’s a harsh element, yet you’re able to manipulate it other than a destructive force. That’s impressive.” </p><p>“Really??” I asked. </p><p>“Oh, yeah,” she said, jumping at the opportunity to change the topic. “It’s a great performance for a human that’s not even a demigod to show that kind of flexibility while using Light. The nature of the light is not a simple destructive force, but it was rare for a mere Chosen to manipulate it like that, using it as a soothing force. Even a demigod might have trouble with it.” </p><p>“Well, I can’t take all the credit, I’m applying some of the tricks I learned from Janelor,” I said, more than happy to give her a viable direction for her suspicions. It was for the better if she thought a combination of my mana manipulation abilities and the secret techniques of a dragon was responsible for it. </p><p>“Good, that pile of scales is finally earning her keep,” she murmured, her animosity showing even with the elation she was feeling. “Now, continue,” she said. </p><p>I slowly massaged her hand for a long while, letting my Light-natured mana invade her body more and more, using the opportunity to understand the unique nature of her body as well as the way her Light-natured body interacted with Light mana. </p><p>With such access, it didn’t take long for me to notice something specific in her body, one that was subtly changing the nature of her mana, making it more rigid than it needed to be. </p><p>Rigid enough to reject the merger of the Light Spark, responsible for extended failure. </p><p>It was clearly not a part of her true nature, but it wasn’t just some simple enchantment either. It was subtle, but woven into her nature subtly enough to be mistaken for one. </p><p>I wasn’t surprised by her not noticing it, because it was not only woven very subtly, but also it actually included a very subtle amount of Divine Spark, but it was used much more complicated manner than I ever thought possible. </p><p>The only reason I noticed that was as the Tantric energy infused her body, it flickered enough to earn my attention. </p><p>Just like that, the mystery deepened even more. Like I didn’t have enough questions to answer. </p><p>After some thinking, I decided to avoid that for a while. Instead, I stood up, catching her eye. “You’re still very tense,” I said. “Do you want me to work on your shoulders? It’ll be a bit exhausting for me magically, but you clearly need a proper massage.”</p><p> —————</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 666000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 7334 / 7334 Mana: 9000 / 9000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Grandmaster Tantric [114/140]</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [85/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Titania - Level 35/38]</p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Marianne - Level 21/29]</p>",

    "content": "<p>I spend a moment watching Cinder, her breaths pushing her chest out as the room continued to burn around her. It would have been the picture of a disaster if it was anyone else in her place. </p><p>But for Cinder, flames danced around her, caressing her skin gently as if they were singing her a lullaby. </p><p>And with her heritage, it might as well be the case. As the weird transformation spread along my body, I started to feel that the phoenixes connected with the concept of fire deeper than I had been expecting. </p><p>I was tempted to turn and leave her here, as flames clearly created a comfortable bed for her. And she certainly deserved her rest. However, ultimately, I decided against it, for one simple reason. </p><p>I couldn’t trust her. </p><p>At least, not in terms of acting like a political agent. There was no guarantee that she wouldn’t throw a tantrum once she woke up — especially since, everything I had seen about her shouted that she lacked the necessary political acumen to truly understand the playground she had stepped on. </p><p>Which meant, she could as well throw a tantrum just to make a point, unaware of the number of plans that would have been destroyed in the process — some of those actually hers. </p><p>Clearly, I needed to bring her along. </p><p>Yet, as I summoned her fascinatingly-useful silver dress back on, I continued looking in her room, hoping to find something still in good condition that would keep her from the gaze of the others. Her wardrobe was disappointed in that aspect, as none of the clothes that survived the fire was useful in terms of reducing the attention carrying her shimmering body wearing a silver dress. </p><p>It wasn’t as much about the modesty of her clothes, but her preference for the brighter end of the spectrum. </p><p>I could have worked to make useful clothing out of them, but instead, I decided to pick an alternative direction. I walked away, carrying her, and stopped by the kitchen to pick up two large tablecloths. </p><p>Naturally, I could have created something more interesting by working on the remains. While not as glamorous as my combat or magic capabilities, they still included a range of abilities. However, this was both easier and potentially more amusing, so I let that slide. </p><p>Since her attitude forced me to take extra work, I decided to make her pay. </p><p>I walked down the corridor, both sides sprawled with magical constructs, though they were much less threatening as I carried their owner. I climbed down two floors, until I was at the basement once more, which had been converted into a cell to house unfortunate guests. </p><p>Like Isolde. </p><p>“You’re here,” she growled as I opened the door, only for her eyes to widen. “And she’s here as well,” she added, her face gaining a vicious smirk as she looked at who I had been carrying. “And you took down the head bitch as well. Thanks,” she said. </p><p>“I’m guessing that she tortured you for you to have such an intense reaction?” I said as I walked closer to her. </p><p>“Worse,” she said, her smile threatening as she locked her eyes on Cinder. “She was smug.” </p><p>I chuckled. “How frightful. And I’m guessing that’s the first time you have to suffer that.”</p><p>“Not particularly,” she answered, her gaze locked. “But she was particularly smug, and she’s an enemy. Since she’s an enemy, there’s no harm in some payback.” </p><p>I chuckled. “You’re a bit late on that aspect.” </p><p>“No!” she gasped. “You lied! You told me that she was an enemy.” </p><p>I let my smirk widen. “And that was true, at the time.” </p><p>“Nonsense,” she was quick to respond as she leaned against the bars of her cell. If it wasn’t for their presence, I had no doubt that she would have charged forward aggressively to teach me a lesson, but the current circumstances didn’t allow for that. </p><p>“Of course, you got me,” I answered, my smirk getting wider. “There’s no way in hell I could actually convince a beautiful and competent woman to change her alliance in a few hours,” I said. </p><p>Isolde had a tendency to be obstinate, which meant she was never the greatest target for sarcasm, even the more obvious kind. Yet, even for her, it was impossible to miss it after her own experience of doing exactly the same, declaring her loyalty in a rather spectacular manner that left her spent. “T-that’s different,” she stammered. “I didn’t have a choice.” </p><p>“I see,” I murmured, looking thoughtful. “So, you would change your mind after I let you go,” I said.</p><p>“No!” she gasped, her urgency clear. “Well, I gave my word…” she added, an uncharacteristic blush invading her face. </p><p>“So, if I let you free of your world,” I followed, which only increased her blushed frustration. “Don’t worry, I have no intention of letting you go,” I said with a chuckle, but with a hard undertone, showing my intent. </p><p>Amusingly, my determination actually allowed her to perk up. And, it sufficiently distracted her from her initial complaint, enough to prevent her from attacking forward once I unlocked her cell. “It’s time to go,” I said with a smirk. </p><p>“Not before I find my bow,” she answered. </p><p>“Do you know where it is?” I asked. </p><p>“I’m sure she knows,” Isolde said as she pointed at Cinder. “Let’s wake her up,” she added as she took a step forward, her hand already raised. </p><p>“Not necessary, I’m absolutely sure she wouldn’t have bothered with where your bow had been placed. Are you sure Lancelot actually brought your bow here? Maybe he kept it, in case he had to tell the Queen about your demise. </p><p>“He wouldn’t!” she gasped. I just shrugged, letting her come to terms that her precious bow was gone. I was almost sure that what I said was correct, and if, by any chance, it was not accurate, I could always ask Cinder to retrieve it later. </p><p>But I certainly didn’t want to waste half a day trying to explore every single room, and Cinder was far too gone to wake her up for such a simple thing. Isolde simply needed to do. </p><p>“How did you manage to…” she murmured as she glanced at Cinder. </p><p>“Bang her until she swore her loyalty to me as well,” I completed her sentence. “I find that a combined offer of untold levels of pleasure, along with promises of assistance to fulfill their most desperate dream works wonders to spice up an offer to change a lady’s allegiance. Don’t you agree?” </p><p>Isolde just blushed. “It’s not like she’s desperate?” she asked. </p><p>“Oh, really? Why do you think so?” I said just as we finished climbing the stairs and once again reached the ground floor. </p><p>We were in the lobby, which was filled with many magical constructs, and while Isolde might not be an expert of magic, she wasn’t unaware of the general value of such constructs, not only costing enough to bankrupt a large noble house, but created enough threat to easily destroy one or two military forts. </p><p>“And did you ever wonder why, despite all that money and power, she’s in the enemy territory, with no loyal assistance and no support? Does it sound like a casual choice?” </p><p>Isolde didn’t answer, but the way her head dipped down gave me the answer I was seeking. Of course, once again, I was fiddling with the truth a bit, as Cinder’s situation was more of a pointless rebellion than desperation.</p><p>Fibbing the truth a bit was hardly my biggest sin to date. </p><p>“I need some new clothes—“ she started, only to fall silent as I threw the tablecloth to her. I had no doubt that, for any other woman, it would have been a great insult to rely on that instead of clothing, but luckily, Isolde was not one of those that cared much about her clothing, especially during a mission. </p><p>Amusingly, she looked strangely arousing in that as she carefully wrapped around that. </p><p>I wrapped the other one around Cinder, but before stepping out, I grabbed Isolde, and pulled her closer, capturing her lips in a searing kiss. </p><p>“What—“ she barely managed to say before her lips were captured in a kiss, her body tensing for a moment before she accepted the invasion of my tongue. </p><p>When I pulled back, she was panting desperately. </p><p>“So, where’s our destination?” Isolde asked, though she was already turning toward the nearest gate as she did so. </p><p>“Good question,” I answered as I paused, realizing that, after the surprise transformation, I didn’t exactly spend any time deciding what should my plan be.</p>",

    "content": "<p>“It’s fun to swim, right,” I said as I looked at the beautiful exotic beauty that was doing her best to stay wrapped around me — her arms wrapped around my neck, her legs around my waist — as we dragged by the raging waters of the river. </p><p>“Are you sure we still can’t use any magic,” she shouted as I easily changed direction to prevent a painful collision, even swimming actively to go even faster. </p><p>“Not if you don’t want to get caught by your boss after stealing everything he owned and distributing them,” I answered. “Well, almost everything,” I corrected as I felt the weight of three weapons, obediently hanging on my waist despite the raging river, impossible to detach. </p><p>Luckily, such abilities didn’t create a flare of magic. </p><p>She didn’t answer, just growled even as she hugged me tighter while I continued to swim, enjoying the full benefits of the transformation — as well as using the opportunity to get used to the strength. </p><p>I had to admit, it was nostalgic, especially since my adventure had started with a very similar moment, forcing me to swim without using any magic to prevent getting caught while a beautiful woman hung on my back desperately… </p><p>Even an unfortunate interaction with a dragon heart was the same, only their timing was different. </p><p>With my strength combined with the speed of the river, it didn’t take long for us to reach the sea, but rather than enjoying that fact, I started swimming deeper into the sea, toward our promised meeting location, almost ten miles away from the shore. </p><p>It would have been more comfortable to ask them to arrive at the shore, of course, but a little exhaustion was nothing compared to reducing risk. It was, without a doubt, the better idea. </p><p>I was confident in my decision, yet fate decided to give me confirmation for it. The magic exploded behind me without a warning, with an intensity that made me tremble. </p><p>“No!” Xia gasped in shock as we turned to look in the direction of the energy. </p><p>Directly toward Rome. </p><p>“What’s going on?” I asked. </p><p>“The true leader of House Junia, he’s Ascending,” she gasped. </p><p>“A-ascending,” I found myself stammering even as I felt my core tremble once more, radiating a sense of fear. Yet, it wasn’t pure terror, which would have been reasonable against the intensity I had been feeling, but something nuanced. Still filled with fear, but like a lion, preparing to defend himself against a bear. </p><p>“I’m guessing he’s not becoming a Sorcerer,” I said as I felt the immensity of the power, one that I was barely able to understand despite my own. </p><p>“Of course not,” she answered. “He’s becoming a Son of Heaven,” she said. </p><p>“That doesn’t exactly help me.” </p><p>“In your country, it’s called differently. An Archmagus,” she corrected. </p><p>“How entertaining,” I murmured as I suppressed the pointless desire to go and fight against him, one that my new instincts begging to do. The term Archmagus was not unfamiliar to me, but it was barely more than scraps of legends I had found when I was shuffling around in Olivia’s library. </p><p>At that time, I dismissed them, assuming that it was just another term for strong sorcerers, the references to their capabilities inaccurate. Yet, the power I was feeling, immense even from a distance, confirmed the truth about those assessments. </p><p>If anything, they undersold it. </p><p>“What’s the best strategy?” I asked. </p><p>“We should move faster, but without using magic,” she rapidly commented. “I’ll try to cast another concealment field.” </p><p>“And that would work against that power,” I said, unable to prevent myself from shimmering in fear. </p><p>“If he was only going to deal with us, no, but he had other problems.” </p><p>I wanted to ask more questions, but chose to start swimming instead. </p><p>Getting away was more important than my curiosity. It didn’t take long for me to receive my answer.</p><p>Another power, comparable to the first one rose. Even stronger, though weirdly contained, I corrected myself, my newly enhanced senses allowing me to analyze the flare with incredible precision. Soon, a third flare joined the second, then a fourth… </p><p>Until the number reached seven, one circled by six. </p><p>Yet, feeling that, I only started to move quicker. The number of great mages that could squash me like a bug increasing was hardly something good, even when they seemed to be against the first one — one that was from House Junia to the best of my guess. </p><p>It proved to be a good choice, as the first one started to rise in power more and more. The other six tried to rise to match the first one… </p><p>Only for them to be interrupted. </p><p>Even with my newfound sensitivity, it was hard to identify what was interrupting them. It was clear that it wasn’t the Archmagus of House Junia that was suppressing them. It felt something external to their power, yet internal at the same time. </p><p>“What’s going on,” I managed to ask despite the desperate speed I was using to swim. </p><p>“It’s the nature of their power. The heavens themselves created the mortals so that, we can’t use the purest magic. The more we use it, the more it restricts us,” she answered. </p><p>My eyes widened as I processed her explanation — colored with her own beliefs, obviously — and contrasted with the Sorcerer ascension ritual, and how it required alignment with the elements for a successful ascension. </p><p>And how my own accidental ascension, triggered by a dragon heart, was the complete opposite. </p><p>I turned my senses toward Rome once more, only to feel the great power of the first Archmagus crashing down, very noticeably toward the Alps, the direction where I had worked hard to fake my escape. </p><p>Once again proving that there was no harm in over-preparation. </p><p>The power didn’t stay focused on the Alps for long. The long-range detection spells were not a simple affair, certainly not when conducted in such a large area. </p><p>Yet, it was clearly different when it carried a power that dozens of Sorcerer couldn’t have gathered at the same time. The power of the Archmagus collapsed with all the power of an avalanche, and even as it did, I could feel the sky suddenly covering clouds, adding to the oppressive feeling. </p><p>I hoped that my disobedient pet avoided the spell — though even for such a spell, analyzing such a wide area in less than a second was likely to be impossible. He was likely searching for more noticeable things. </p><p>Like dragon hearts. </p><p>Failing to find his target, the power started to spread, the initially focused ray slowly spreading all over Italy, including the shores. We only had a few seconds before the power reached us. </p><p>“Brace yourself, and cast the hiding spell as strongly as you can manage.” </p><p>“It wouldn’t work,” she gasped in shock. “I’m already about to collapse. I can’t resist it. And it’s impossible to resist an Archmagus.” </p><p>“Not when he’s spreading his power across a whole country,” I said. “You just need to resist it for a minute, that’s enough,” I encouraged her. “Then, he would stop.”</p><p>The last part wasn’t just an empty encouragement. I could feel the immense power getting restricted with each passing second, bringing him back to the level of the other six, shackled and neutered. </p><p>For the other six, I was unable to see the nature of those shackles, their completed form not radiating enough energy to diagnose — even their presence I was only able to feel due to their overwhelming effect.</p><p> Watching them form from nothing, on the other hand, was much more informative. The four elements of creation, fire, earth, water, and air, rose together obediently, merging together in an inexplainable pattern until they turned into chains. </p><p>Chains that wrapped around the only free Archmagus I could feel. </p><p>And, that wasn’t the only reaction nature showed. In the beginning, the more power he displayed, the darker the skies became, with lightning exploding between clouds. </p><p>Like skies were threatening to bring punishment.</p><p>Admittedly, considering my own experience, there was a high chance it wasn’t just a metaphor my mind created to deal with the immensity of the situation.  </p><p>Luckily the increasing suppression effect meant that, when the effect of the spell reached us, it had weakened sufficiently for Xia to successfully deflect the effects. Or, at least, I assumed she was successful when that wave of power passed us, but no deadly spell followed it. </p><p>Soon after the wave of spell passed over us, the chains tightened around his magical presence completely, restricting him to the same level as the other six. </p><p>Then, they started to fade, disappearing as quickly until there were no signs of their presence remained. “You can stop….” I said, only to feel her collapse against my back, already unconscious. </p><p>“Well, she deserves it,” I murmured as I continued swinging, and a minute later, found the ship Theodora arranged for me, though it was already unfurling its sails, suggesting that they changed their mind about waiting for us. </p><p>Not that I could blame that after that scary storm, one that appeared and disappeared in a minute. </p><p>Luckily, we were just in time…</p>",

    "content": "<p>I was planning to drive alone, but as I walked, I noticed a pair of cheerleaders walking toward me, the sway of their hips — excessive and exaggerated — which, combined with their clothing choice — one wearing a skirt, the other wearing shorts, each small enough to be used as belts in an emergency — left no doubt about their intention. </p><p>Maybe Thad’s warning about cheerleaders being in a hunting mood was less of an exaggeration, and more of a warning. </p><p>Yet, before they could cover the distance halfway, I had been tackled by a familiar form. Megan again. “Congratulations, honey,” she exclaimed after a spectacular kiss, though her gaze was not on me as she said so, but somewhere behind me. </p><p>Roughly the direction the enthusiastic cheerleaders were, marking her territory. </p><p>“What a nice greeting,” I said as I chuckled as I wrapped my arm around her waist and continued to walk toward the parking lot. “So, are you here with your car?” </p><p>“No, Kim dropped me here,” she answered. “And, I assumed you wouldn’t mind driving me to the party. I hope you don’t promise those seats to anyone else.” </p><p>“Don’t worry, the seats are empty, so there’s no problem,” I said, then let my smirk widen. “As long as you have the necessary payment to get an exclusive trip, of course,” I said, enjoying the flicker of fury she threw to my side. </p><p>“You’re pushing your luck,” she growled. </p><p>“Well, we can always turn it into an open bidding system, and I have a feeling I can easily find other applicants for the position,” I said. </p><p>“Not for at least another week,” Megan warned, her voice more threatening than any attempt of poor little Kevin despite his best efforts. Yet, the tenseness of her face suggested she got the message, and she added. “But since you’re making such a big sacrifice, I’ll make sure to keep the trip satisfactory,” she whispered. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said as I opened the passenger side door, showing a small flicker of gentlemanly behavior before I took my seat and started driving. </p><p>Despite her earlier promise, she did nothing during the trip other than examine me carefully, and I let that slide. Her aim was clear, she was trying to get a new measure of me since her earlier calculations had been turned inaccurate. </p><p>I stayed silent deliberately, not feeding her with information, not giving her a clue on how to handle me. Not that it was necessary, but watching her growing frustration as she struggled to keep it hidden was certainly fun. </p><p>Then, we arrived at the den, only to be greeted by a shocking show. Loud music exploded followed by another set of champagne — once again showing the excessive budget of the football team — as we walked in, everyone cheering around us. </p><p>And just like that, people gathered around me and started throwing me in the air repeatedly, a move I accepted since it gave me a lot of Intent. </p><p>Nothing could be compared to the game itself, of course, but it was not my habit to turn my nose to smaller sources of income just because I earned a surprise windfall. </p><p>I had always been financially astute, and I had no reason not to apply that to more magical aspects of my assets. </p><p>Then, when they finally allowed me to land back, Thad walked toward me. “So, are you ready to receive your reward from our loyal cheerleaders,” Thad said. </p><p>Megan was close enough to intervene. “Wait,” she said to Thad. “What reward.” </p><p>“It’s just a small show of their appreciation,” Thad said, smirking as he ignored Megan’s tense gaze completely. </p><p>I caught her gaze and looked at her sharply. Her tenseness intensified, catching my message easily. Meaning, that if she wanted to continue playing my girlfriend, she needed to act a little more open-minded, especially right after my victory. </p><p>After a staring contest that barely lasted five seconds, she declared her surrender. “Well, since you guys went all the trouble for the hero of the game, it would be a bitch move on my part to stop it,” she started. </p><p>She let her sentence fade, clearly building up to a condition, but that was the wrong strategy against Thad’s enthusiasm. “Come on, girls,” he shouted, and six girls walked into the view. “Do you like it?” he asked. </p><p>“So, what do you think?” he asked as the girls formed a line. </p><p>“How could I not like it?” I said with a snicker that matched Thad’s enthusiasm. Indeed, how could I not, when there were six girls, across six different body types and colors? </p><p>And more interestingly, cosplaying as chess pieces. </p><p>Admittedly, they were not the most clever or authentic cosplay I had ever seen in my life, but since I was not only decidedly straight but also going through a long dry streak — albeit with some interruptions that went a long way to take the edge — I didn’t feel like I was in a place to nitpick. </p><p>The one that was closest to us was clearly the king, carrying a glowing scepter and wrapped in a velvety red cape, one that hardly helped to cover even a single bit of her beautiful shapely body, almost certainly belonging to a cheerleader. She didn’t have a crown though, her blonde hair flowing freely. Other than those, she was just wearing a skimpy set of lingerie, red to match her velvet cape. </p><p>The reason that she wasn’t wearing a crown was clear, because the girl behind her was wearing it, a redhead this time, though it was difficult to differentiate them by a body type, equally delicious. Unlike the king, she had no cape and wore nothing but a set of black lacy lingerie, complete with a garter belt. </p><p>After that, came the bishop, or more accurately, a delicious black girl wearing a sexy nun outfit, her tits barely staying stuffed in the costume and her hips trying to burst out with every step doing wonders to compensate for the lack of her thematic inaccuracy. She was considerably thicker than the other two girls, making her a fine addition to the mix. </p><p>Following her came a Latino beauty, wearing sexy bikini chainmail, her curves more than enough to rival her bishop counterpart. Her ass failed the comparison, but her amazing boobs, straining her chainmail top, were more than enough to compensate for it.  </p><p>The rook costume would have been comical, just two pieces of paper with boxes drawn on, trying to render the bricks of a castle wall, if it wasn’t the absolute killer body of the girl. A brunette with olive skin, beautiful enough for a heart attack, and unlike the others who were wearing lingerie, she was wearing just panties, using those comically-drawn papers to cover her breasts instead. </p><p>A deficient solution at best. Luckily, the faults of the costume were much more interesting than the solution itself. </p><p>And the last girl, who was supposed to be a pawn — mostly through a process of elimination, as her costume was impossible to get otherwise. She was a cute half-Asian, compensating for her lithe body by wearing lingerie that might snap off at a wrong move. </p><p>Altogether, exactly the sexist, tone-deaf display a football team might use to greet a new member that was also a chess player. </p><p>Still excellent, admittedly.</p><p>But as the man in the center, as the girls gathered around me in a circle, swaying to a song that would have fitted a seedy strip club perfectly, I was hardly in a position to reject the fruits of their display. </p><p>“I was saying,” I heard Megan cut in, poking me. “While you certainly earned his reward, maybe it’s for the best if you limit yourself to watching.” Yet, she managed to deliver that in a playful manner, which earned chuckles from the crowd rather than booing.  </p><p>“It’s cruel to present such beautiful gifts, yet ask me not to unwrap them,” I said mockingly. </p><p>Megan smiled, in a way, a less observant man might have mistaken for good-humored fun, but her eyes got even icier. “But since they went into such big trouble, they could still give a reward. A lap dance each, maybe?” she asked. </p><p>“Ouch,” I said even as the crowd laughed. It was certainly a nice compromise, and I had a feeling that, if I tried to push my luck more, she would retaliate. “Whatever you wish, sweetheart.” </p><p>She clearly didn’t intend on loosening her control, as she stayed next to me even as the first girl stood next to me. “We can’t do it here, it’s too cold,” the first girl, the one that was dressed as the king, grabbed me and started dragging me inside. </p><p>Soon, the other girls grabbed me as well, dragging me inside. Pity Megan followed as well, clearly intending to intervene. Even that would have been enough to make me break up our fake relationship, but ironically, it was the great performance she displayed as she managed the fakeness that stopped me. </p><p>Her great ability to manage the public perception was too useful with the nature of my power, and more importantly, I was dealing with too many secrets to let her poke around to turn the tables in another breakup. </p><p>And, Megan didn’t waste any time by showing her presence was worthwhile. When the chess cosplayers tried to drag me into a room without a window, Megan intervened, and chose another room. </p><p>One with large windows that were facing inside, yet dark enough to hide the details, turning it into a public yet mysterious show. </p><p>Perfect for generating even more Intent.</p>",

    "content": "<p>It was an amazing feeling to walk on the field under the cheers of the crowd, and it would have been so even if every moment of their cries didn’t mean more Intent for me. </p><p>Of course, the Traits that were related to their current mood and perception had long been completed, but that didn’t mean the Intent I was gathering was useless. First, a considerable portion of it was being absorbed by my guide, who was still the only source of information I had — however flighty and unreliable. </p><p>And more Intent was the only hope I had to awaken her. </p><p>More importantly, the System was still absorbing the Intent even if it didn’t give me an immediate return. And since Intent was able to help my guide to recover, maybe it would work the same way with the System. </p><p>It was a risk I was willing to take. </p><p>Distracted by my thoughts, I was caught flatfooted when someone tackled me, with a speed that might have caused me to fall down if the responsible person hadn’t been barely above a hundred pounds. </p><p>Before I could react, a pair of lips pressed against me. A pair of beautiful yet familiar lips, delivering a searing kiss. </p><p>Megan.</p><p>I would have chuckled in amusement if the tongue slipping inside my mouth worked wonders to suppress any sound I could make. I decided to say nothing, just suffering the consequences of the sudden assault obediently.</p><p>My hand already slipping under her skirt to once again enjoy the feeling of her tight ass. </p><p>“Congratulations, honey,” Megan said as she finally pulled back from the kiss, far too loudly to be accidental as the crowd was still around us, cheering and whistling. </p><p>I chuckled as I leaned forward, whispering into her ear. “I thought we were going to break up after the match,” I whispered. </p><p>“Well, that was before you decided to hide just how good of a player you were from me. Things are different for now,” she whispered back. I was impressed, because while her voice was sharp enough to be a divorce lawyer, she managed to look like a lovesick puppy as she delivered those words. </p><p>“And, you expect me to accept that alteration without any argument. Maybe I had other plans?” </p><p>She smirked, like she was a chess player that just forced a move that would lead to an inevitable loss in three. “I’m sure you won’t just dump your loving girlfriend after she had just delivered such an intense display of love.” </p><p>I looked at her sharply, letting Intimidation seep through to destroy her confident expression, but only for a moment. “You’re lucky that I like how vicious you are,” I said as I squeezed her ass hard, earning a gasp. </p><p>One that was decidedly not fake. </p><p>“Don’t be like that,” she said as she loosened her legs around my waist and stepped down, but her hand was still on my chest. “You still have your date with Kim, and I’m sure I can convince her to increase the intensity for compensation.” </p><p>“Oh, honey,” I answered softly. “You’re wildly misguided if you think you can get away with just that after altering our agreement without consulting me first,” I whispered. </p><p>I expected Megan to look dissatisfied with that, but her face gained a competitive expression, showing she was more than happy to bargain. </p><p>Yet, before she could respond, she was interrupted. </p><p>“That’s enough, lovebirds,” Thad said as he grabbed my arm and started dragging me. “We still have our post-game speech, and he’s too important to be missing from that part.” </p><p>Thad looked at Megan with a stupid expression that was good enough to convince me if I didn’t see his more serious side. “You can see him at the party tonight, but make sure to be early to protect him from the cheerleaders. I heard that some of them have really interesting ideas for him tonight.” </p><p>I just chuckled at Megan’s frustration as Thad dragged me away. “Thanks,” I said. “I appreciate the assistance. Especially the bluff about the cheerleaders. It would help me a lot tonight,” I said as I chuckled. </p><p>That earned a loud explosion from Thad, his laughter echoing off the walls. “Oh, sweet naive boy. That was no bluff. I recommend you to be careful around the cheerleaders tonight, and don’t accept any drinks. I had heard more than one bet about who would be the first one to bed the new hero of the team. They would drain you dry if you get captured by them.” </p><p>“That bad,” I said with a chuckle. </p><p>“Oh, you have no idea. They are savages,” Thad said with an exaggerated shudder, but the smirk on his face showed the related memories were hardly unpleasant. </p><p>I chuckled as I followed him to the locker room, only to meet with another surprise, this time a pair of explosions. I tensed for a moment before a liquid exploded on me, and only relaxed as I noticed the source of it. </p><p>Champagne for celebration. </p><p>Technically, we weren’t supposed to drink, and certainly not in the locker room, but in a victory, especially one against a famous rival college, rules were much looser. Even the offensive players were looking happy despite their pain — as the opposing offense did their best to punish our offense for our daring, misguidedly thinking that we would care about their welfare. </p><p>The victory was an excellent painkiller. </p><p>Thad grabbed a bottle and joined the small group that seemed determined to drown me in champagne, and I chuckled, letting it happen. </p><p>The celebration lasted for a while before they started cheering. “Speech, speech, speech.” </p><p>As they cheered, I grabbed the bottle from Thad’s hand, and took a deep sip. It was not my habit to give speeches, and I wasn’t particularly skillful in that aspect. </p><p>Yet, my most recent trait, Leadership, gave me a weird new sensation. It was an ephemeral sensation, but it allowed me to, for the lack of a better term, feel the mood and heartbeat of a group that looked to me for guidance, along with a subtle instinct of how to direct and manipulate such a sensation. </p><p>“I want to mark such a momentous occasion by a quote from the great general Julius Caesar. Veni, Vidi, Vici,” I started, only to receive some good-natured jeers, calling me a nerd. I smirked as I waited for those jabs to reach an apex. “Or, to translate, We came, we saw, and we beat the shit out of them and sent them to their mother, crying!” I exclaimed. </p><p>It was not an accurate translation, but the team didn’t seem to mind the liberty I took as they exploded in cheers and laughter, cheering my name. “Terry, Terry, Terry!” </p><p>I just smirked as I felt someone grab me and they lifted me high, throwing me up repeatedly in celebration. A great change from their earlier attitude, brought by the great success I enabled. </p><p>The celebration lasted for a while — a short while, as the real celebration awaited us in the Den — then we split into the showers. </p><p>Though as the celebration continued, I noticed that Carter was not around. “Where’s the captain?” I asked, as his absence was rather weird. </p><p>It might have been different if he had performed badly, but I had made sure he had many opportunities to show off, giving him four sacks, one interception, and three tackles for loss — which was an excellent statistic for any defensive player no matter the opponent, and it was even more impressive in a game against a strong opponent. </p><p>“He’s already with the coach,” Thad answered. </p><p>“Really? At this hour?” I asked, and Thad nodded. “Yes, it surprised me as well. But I have a meeting with him tonight as well, as with four other starters, each key player for their position.” </p><p>“Interesting,” I said, surprised. “He didn’t ask me for a meeting. Do you think it’s something important?” </p><p>“Probably, but I wouldn’t worry about that if I were you. You have displayed an incredible performance today. I’m sure he wants to reorganize our defense around you, and wants to discuss that with us first to make sure we are aligned.” </p><p>“Makes sense,” I said as I grabbed my bag and left the locker room. “Anyway, I have something more important today.” </p><p>“Yes,” Thad said. “The party!” </p><p>“Exactly,” I said, feeling enthusiastic about the upcoming party. And, unlike the previous time where I had been struggling just to maximize the scraps of Intent I was receiving, this time my objective was to have fun. </p><p>Proper fun… </p>",

    "content": "<p>After that spectacular meeting, I had expected the rest of my school day to go without an event of significance. </p><p>That proved to be wrong. </p><p>The realization hit me in the form of a pair of hands suddenly grabbing my arm and pulling me inside. The pull wasn’t strong enough to pull me in if I resisted, but the hand that grabbed me was feminine, with a certain milky chocolate complexion that was very familiar. </p><p>“Hey, Naomi,” I chuckled even as I looked around while the door closed behind me, only to realize that I was locked in a small closet, not enough to fully open my arms. Her frustrated expression suggested that she was about to deliver a negative statement. </p><p>I wasn’t in the mood to hear that, so I decided to prevent those words from forming in the first place. </p><p>I leaned forward, capturing her lips even as I pushed her against the wall. Her lips widened, probably to give a complaint, but only allowing my tongue to slip inside even as my hands landed on her hips, squeezing her hips, enjoying their amazing tightness that was only possible thanks to her obsessive diet and incredible yoga obsession. </p><p>“I missed you too,” I whispered as I looked at her blushing face. “But do you think that a random closet in the middle of the school day is the best way to go about it?” </p><p>“I …” she murmured dazedly, her words forgotten in the haze of the moment, and the friendly touches I was putting along her side and my throaty whisper hardly helped her to recover. “I wasn’t trying to—“ she tried to say after a moment, but her voice was loud enough to allow me to silence her again. </p><p>This time, pressing my finger to her lips. </p><p>“Careful,” I whispered. “You need to whisper. We don’t want people to come and find us stuffed in here, do we?” </p><p>“W-we don’t,” she stammered, though her voice was much softer. She even stopped breathing for a fleeting moment, her eyes jumping between my face and the door. I could feel her tremble under my grip, which hardly helped the tightness of my pants. </p><p>The sudden expression of panic that bloomed on her face was beautiful, and her fleeting frozen stature allowed my hands to explore her body even more. She might be wearing loose jeans that hid her hips from the gaze of others, but the same looseness didn’t protect it from my touch. </p><p>I tightened my grip on her waist and pulled her closer, the whimper that escaped her mouth suggesting that she was aware of my ‘growing’ appreciation as well. “Are you okay?” I whispered softly. “You suddenly look distracted.”</p><p>“Y-you…” she whispered, her anger flaring, but it was a momentary flare, the kind that only inflamed the heat of her arousal. It took a while for her to find her voice once more. “I have an important issue to talk about.” </p><p>“Really?” I asked as I leaned forward. “Is it about needing my help to pick some more clothes? We can make a trip out of it tomorrow.” </p><p>“N-no,” she managed to stammer. “I wanted to—“ she tried to add, only to be interrupted, this time by my hand slipping under her top. </p><p>“Are you feeling well?” I asked, concerned. Your skin feels a bit hot, like you have a fever. Let me check more directly,” I said as I leaned more, pressing my lips against her neck without waiting for her permission. </p><p>That earned another shiver in me. “Hmm, your skin feels a bit warm, but not enough to be a fever.” I pulled back, but still, let my fingers crawl up.  </p><p>“I’m not sick,” she managed to whisper, but as my fingers started to climb up, her breathing got rougher. She paused, trying to get a hold of her emotions, but it just give me the opportunity to take the next step. </p><p>“I see,” I whispered, letting my voice gain a throaty quality, the kind that let no doubt about my carnal thoughts. She gulped panicked after my whisper, which let my hand slip down, and start fiddling with the button of her jeans. “Stress, then. You want me to help you relax, like I helped you relax Saturday, right? Just like a best friend should.”  </p><p>I stood still for a moment after unbuttoning her jeans, enjoying her panic even as I gave her a chance to back down, yet she chose to do nothing under the combined effects of arousal and panic. </p><p>Then, I leaned forward. </p><p>“It’s not that-” she tried to say, but in her hurry, she didn’t think about turning her head away, allowing me to silence her with another kiss. As my dancing tongue invaded her mouth, it hardly felt friendly, at least not one without some incredible benefits. </p><p>As she tried to process the invasion of my tongue, my hands already managed to reach the door, engaging the lock — though, why such a small room had a lock from inside was certainly curious — before starting working on the important part. One pulled her jeans down, immediately followed by her panties, while the other pulled her shirt and bra up, creating beautiful, functional nudity. </p><p>If she had any problem with that, her hands certainly didn’t show it, as, after a momentary pause, they started working, but not to prevent my hands from their tasks, but busy dealing with my belt. </p><p>Maybe she wanted to use it to tie my hands. </p><p>But if that was the case, it was certainly the wrong move to grab my neck and pull me deeper into the kiss after managing to free my shaft from its tight prison. </p><p>I pushed forward carefully, letting my shaft caress her wetness without slipping, letting her wetness grow while my fingers worked on her amazing breasts. </p><p>If she had any problems with that, her tongue didn’t inform me about that. Yet, it was good that her lips were pressing against mine, because it allowed me to suppress her sudden moan as one of my fingers slipped down and started teasing her knob, preventing a small scandal as people noticed. </p><p>I decided to keep my lips connected to hers. </p><p>Just to be on the safe side, and nothing more, of course. </p><p>The corridor she had intercepted me was hardly the busiest corridor, but it was better safe than sorry. And, it wasn’t like her pouty lips were a punishment. </p><p>It was good, because another moan escaped her mouth once more, challenging my lips’ ability to keep her silent. Thankfully, it was a challenge that my lips ultimately won. </p><p>Continuing with the same pace was tempting. It was just not tempting enough to ignore her growing wetness, drenching my girth with each push. </p><p>“Ready?” I asked as I slid my hands on her hips, raising them slightly to allow a better angle. </p><p>She said nothing, but I decided to take the way she grabbed my hair and pulled me back to a kiss as a positive answer. I pushed my hips, her wet lips wrapping around the head of my shaft. </p><p>If it wasn’t for the risky location, I might have pulled back, forcing her to beg for it until she received her ultimate reward. The way her warmth enveloped me would have made that a challenging decision, though not enough to make teasing impossible. </p><p>Not with the great reward of keeping her on the edge promised. </p><p>Yet, our location was hardly conducive for such an adventure. Nor it was one to push forward recklessly until our hips exploded beautifully against each other. </p><p>Instead, I pushed them slowly and steadily, her wetness working wonders to make that slow tease an amazing experience as she pulled the trick of making it disappear. She let out a hard grunt, slipping through my lips as well, relying on the door to keep it manageable. </p><p>“Did you miss me in you?” I whispered as I pulled for a breather, which made her duck her head down with a sudden bout of shyness — an intensely amusing reaction considering what else we had been doing intensely. </p><p>Clearly, just because she could handle a threesome — a spectacular one — or a tryst in school didn’t mean she could handle the mildest kind of bedroom talk. </p><p>I chuckled as I pressed my lips against hers, my hips pushing steadily as my shaft explored the depths of her core, each push triggering louder cries that challenged my ability to keep her voice suppressed.</p><p>Under such a challenging situation, the combination of unfamiliar angle, risky location, and the speedy growth of her arousal, it wasn’t shocking for her to start trembling with the telltale signs of arousal. I deepened the kiss, preventing her from pulling a crowd, and only pulled back once her trembles subsided. </p><p>“Let’s move, we still have a class to go,” I whispered, reminding her that our quickie had rather important time restrictions. We were already late to class, but there was a difference between five minutes late, and fifteen minutes late. </p><p>“R-right,” she stammered as she quickly fixed her clothing — though needing a few touches from me to make sure there was nothing too suspicious, a fact that was helped by her avoidance of makeup, as otherwise, she would have needed to replace it completely. </p><p>Only after making sure there was nothing wrong with her looks did I open the door and left, and we split, going to our individual classes. The uncomfortable feeling as I stuffed my erection back into my pants was not exactly comfortable. </p><p>But it was certainly worthwhile to properly distract her from her initial objective… </p>",

    "content": "<p>I didn’t push the headmistress about the subject immediately, letting her handle the intense emotional rush it triggered for a long while before she started to answer. </p><p>“Gods are … different,” she murmured. “I don’t know much about them much other than they are intensely linked to the Divine Spark. Some believe that they came from Divine Spark and conjure an existence later on,” she said. </p><p>“Like their avatars, only on a larger scale,” I suggested. </p><p>“Yes,” she said, not even looking annoyed at the interruption. It was clearly a difficult subject for her to think about. </p><p>“Considering just how much Divine Spark you have already merged in your body, I’m going to take a wild guess and say you’re not a believer of that theory.” </p><p>“No, I’m not,” she said. “At least not for the current generation of gods,” she said, but I could feel her tensing even as she did so, giving all the signals that it was not something she wanted to talk about, but slipped out. </p><p>I believed it to be an accident. First, I saw her trying to deliberately mislead me, and it was certainly not a topic she was particularly competent at. And, as much as someone spilling a critical nugget of information like that sounded unbelievable, she lived in isolation for almost two centuries, with limited contact with anyone, always struggling to hide her true nature. </p><p>It was not particularly surprising that she accidentally blurted critical information while talking to someone that she thought she could trust. </p><p>And in a way, she wasn’t wrong about trusting me. Not the way she thought, just following every little order of hers obediently, but actively solving her problems. </p><p>Of course, those might arrive in the form of some intimate activities she hadn’t been expecting, but he doubted that she would complain about that once they started. </p><p>The others were very enthusiastic participants.</p><p>“So, you wanted to replicate their achievement by absorbing the Light Spark,” I said, not focusing on that aspect. I might extract more about what different generations of gods meant if I pushed, but that would come in the form of putting her into a defensive pose. </p><p>Instead, I treated that as an inconsequential phrase, and focused on topics she was clearly more willing to talk about. </p><p>She just nodded, her expression proud yet desolate at the same time, showing that, while she was not proud of the situation she found herself in, struggling to survive, that didn’t change the pride she felt at her decision. </p><p>Admittedly, she had a lot to be proud of. I had no idea of the circumstances that led her to find that much Divine Spark while she was under the control of the system, but I was willing to bet that it was a singular event, forcing her to take such a monumental risk. </p><p>Yet, not only she did do so, but also she managed to develop a genius way to balance it with Darkness Spark that not only kept her Light Spark under control but also allowed her to hide from the System. </p><p>I admired her, though that only tempted me more to finally grab her wings and pull them back while I took her from behind, testing her angelic cries to the limit. </p><p>I used the opportunity to focus on the more practical aspects of the plight, and leave the topic of other gods to another day. None of her answers taught me anything I didn’t know from my own sneaky tests, but it was good to have an excuse for my knowledge. </p><p>“I think it's doable to help you contain divine spark more, especially when combined with the techniques that I managed to steal from … her,” I started, the slight pause leaving no doubt about what I was talking about, and her frustration told me the exact nature of her feeling. Then, I asked a question that would bring the discussion to one that I had been searching for. </p><p>“Do you have any theory about why my containment spells are working better on Divine Spark?” I asked. </p><p>“It must be about the elastic nature of your mana, coming from the Degenerate,” she murmured dismissively. “It’s a problem for the impact of the rest of your spells, but coincidentally, it helps our circumstances.” </p><p>I barely held back laughter at the ease she dismissed the solution, her tone reminding me of the nobles talking about their servants. It was not insulting, at least not deliberately, but there was a casual attitude in her dismissal, the absolute confidence in the assessment. </p><p>Whether that underestimation was earned or not, it was a different subject. </p><p>“Who exactly is this degenerate?” I asked. </p><p>“No one really important,” she said dismissively.</p><p>“As you can imagine, it’s not entirely true for my case,” I said, yet deliberately not mentioning why she needed to care about the Degenerate more in her condition. Her underestimation worked perfectly for my aim to hide the true capability of Tantric. </p><p>She seemed disinterested in spending time on that while she had bigger issues to focus on, but catching my determined gaze, she actually broke her habit of not speaking more than a few words and actually started talking. </p><p>“First, you need to understand, despite the power the name implies, not all gods are the same. There are strong gods, and there are weak gods. Then, there are bottom feeders, the kind that only technically counted as gods due to their nature of power depending on Divine Spark.” </p><p>“Is this about the nature of the Divine Spark, or just something about the user?” </p><p>“Both,” she answered, though not looking particularly happy with my interruption. “There’s a reason that Divine Spark is the greatest treasure of the gods, the kind that they are willing to destroy entire planes to get a Spark of correct nature. It’s the reason that, for most of the concept, there’s only one God.” </p><p>“Because they fight until the strong devour the weak,” I guessed, earning a nod. </p><p>“Exactly,” she answered. “The power and the potential Divine Spark represents is simply makes impossible for a rival god of same nature to appear.” </p><p>“And, I’m guessing that’s the reason about the origin,” I interrupted. “After all, fewer rivals would appear if they were unaware of the possibility in the first place.’ </p><p>“Yes,” she answered, but the angry glare on her cute face showed she didn’t exactly appreciate my growing interruptions. </p><p>Too bad for her that I had no intention of stopping. “And, how about the nature of the Divine  Spark, how does it factor in.” </p><p>“That’s more complicated,” she answered, her voice trembling just enough to display her lack of confidence in her statement. Not that I was surprised. Divine Spark didn’t seem like a topic that a lot of notes lying around, and I doubted the people that knew about it would be simply sharing their findings. </p><p>Especially the gods who relied on their Spark for supremacy. </p><p>“How complicated?” I still asked, probing her more about the subject. </p><p>“It’s possible to talk about tiers between divine spark, but that’s usually about the range of the domain and the way it could be applied. Some, like Light and Darkness, restrict each other, and it’s hard to argue which is stronger than the other. Some, like Storm and Chaos, cover aspects similar enough to imply a hierarchical relationship. And there are some Divine Natures that are simply worthless…” </p><p>“And I’m guessing Degenerate is one of them,” I commented, only to receive a nod. </p><p>She left me with an interesting question. I wondered whether the Degenerate she was talking about actually used Tantric, or used something similar that she was mistaking. Not that it mattered much, as her theories didn’t include many facts. They were barely enough to provide a starting point. </p><p>“How about the four cardinal elements, fire, water, earth, and air,” I asked. “Where those four lie in comparison.” </p><p>“That’s the domain of elemental lords, and it’s best left untouched, especially when compared to Gods,” she answered, quick to squash that aspect. And seeing her fear, I decided not to push the situation too much.  “As a mage, you can use it, but never in a location that can actually contact with Primordial Aether without the protection of the Planar Shadow. </p><p>I still remembered Aviada’s disappearance, and the elemental monsters followed it, making clear that it was something that was best left untouched. </p><p>“I understand,” I said as I looked at her. “Thanks for the explanation. Now, I feel much more confident in containing Divine Spark. Are you ready?” </p><p>She nodded, and I raised my hand toward her… </p><p> —————</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 630000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 7334 / 7334 Mana: 9000 / 9000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Grandmaster Tantric [114/140]</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [85/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Titania - Level 35/38]</p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Marianne - Level 21/29]</p>",

    "content": "<p>I didn’t need to think for a long time about my next destination after I left the royal quarters, and turned toward the center of Silver Spires. </p><p>The target of my hurried steps was the office of the headmistress, who had been waiting for me for a long while. </p><p>However, my hurry had little to do with the patience she might have been feeling, despite the position she held or the magical power she commanded. </p><p>On the contrary, regardless of those factors, I had been planning to keep her waiting for some more. But, once again, I was forced to adjust my plans in light of the most recent information.</p><p>Which was something that I had been dealing with as a frustrating commonality. </p><p>It was the perils of trying to survive in a complicated world. Even as my power started to reach a point that encroached to a point that was supposed to intimidate others, I was discovering new heights to scale. I either needed to be flexible, or receive a painful lesson… </p><p>The latter was not exactly a fun option, so I adjusted my plans once more, sending a magical message to the headmistress once I arrived at the entrance of her tower. </p><p>Once again, the door opened once more, but this time, her office door was open rather than her living quarters. </p><p>After the short climb through the spiral stairs, I found her at her desk once more, working on a very thick pile of paper, one that was about the management of the school. She might be a hands-off manager of the school, but that didn’t save her from the paperwork — especially since the latest undead troubles, teaching her that the number of people she could trust in her school was even less than she had assumed. </p><p>And while she clearly didn’t care much about Silver Spires’ general efficiency, she needed it to be still in working condition, at least if she wanted to still have her convenient concealment — one that clearly prevented the Eternals from meddling with that directly. </p><p>She was wearing her black robe, but her wings were out, which created a beautiful contrast. Though, it wasn’t as interesting as the other contrast I could sense once I used my magical senses, dancing on her skin, the Darkness Spark from the ward occasionally getting free only to fly directly to her, like beautiful dark butterflies flying against her brightness. </p><p>Interesting reaction, I realized. It allowed me to see why she had to force herself to cleanse after every work day, although the reaction between the Light and Darkness Sparks was mysteriously confusing. </p><p>Though the flow of Darkness Spark was not a lot, and only at the center of the ward, it was a phenomenon that she needed to worry about. It was not something she could avoid, as the same interference allowed her to use her magic while avoiding self-immolation. </p><p>Trying to control an excessive amount of Divine Spark, especially one as volatile as the light spark, was a monumental challenge. </p><p>Luckily, she had me, her newest loyal servant, to help her! </p><p>“Sorry about that, she was picky about her food as expected,” I said, relying on her distaste against Janelor to keep the explanation short, which was all I needed to get a dismissive sigh. </p><p>She looked back with an annoyed expression that didn’t target me, showing that my excuse achieved its job excellently. </p><p>I expected her to stand up and lead me toward the upstairs, but instead, she just raised her hand and presented it to me. “Start working on creating storages under my skin,” she ordered, not bothering to remove her cloak, her tone sharp. </p><p>Too sharp, even, though the reason turned clear when I touched her hand, and a small blush spread to her face. For all her immense strength and authority, she was woefully inexperienced when it came to even the most innocent kind of physical contact. </p><p>A tempting detail, but after the latest discoveries about the princess, I reluctantly stayed focused on the mission even as I sent my mana into her body, one that had some tantric quality, but not to a degree that would make it noticeable for the headmistress.  </p><p>[-691 Mana]</p><p> Luckily, the overwhelming yet straight nature of her mana helped immensely in that aspect, leaving her blind to my subtle tricks. </p><p>Most of the mana I had sent into her body went into building the storage I had promised her in the middle of her palm — something she trusted me to do after my success replicating the same feat in my own body — while a small portion went into her body, exploring the nature of the Divine Spark in her body. </p><p>It wasn’t the first time I had the opportunity to assess her, but this attempt had several advantages. For one, she asked me to cast a spell in her body, which gave me an excuse for the obvious presence of mana in her body, allowing me to have a much better view than the fleeting glimpse I got earlier. Also, the extended study of the abilities of the princess gave me a baseline about how Divine Spark should be functioning without the assistance of the system — at least partially. </p><p>And, with that perspective, I gained a new appreciation of just how dangerous the headmistress’ situation was. </p><p>The first, and the greatest, the difference was the nature of the divine spark. The Darkness Spark under the control of the princess was calm and obedient, soft enough that I had to stretch my detection capabilities to the limit even when she was using it. </p><p>The light spark under the headmistress’ control — if we could call it that — was much more different. It was sharp and unruly, like a diamond with sharp edges, if the diamond could explode with the weakest accidental caress. </p><p>Yet, if the problem was limited to that, the headmistress wouldn’t struggle to deal with it for years — likely enough years to be counted in centuries. All she needed to find was external storage to dump all of it outside, using physical storage similar to the ruined spear the princess made me use as a research project. </p><p>The next thing I noticed was a connection, this time only due to a combination of Tantric and Biomancy. The Light Spark in her body was connected to her life in a very intricate manner, deeply enough that I couldn’t even imagine the consequences if she just tried to abandon it. </p><p>Or someone forcibly extracted it from her. </p><p>The scraps I managed to take off were nothing, of course, but the same didn’t apply to the barely restrained bundle of light inside her, barely suppressed with all the focus she could put on the task. </p><p>And even then, it only succeeded because of her nature as an angel, and her mana was very similar to the Light Spark in the first place. Anyone else trying the same inefficient blunt force strategy would have exploded in seconds. </p><p>No wonder she was so enthusiastic about having storage in her, which would allow her to contain the Light Spark easier — which would finally allow her to act freely, maybe even to the point of finally leaving the oppressive wards she had been leaving for decades and centuries.</p><p>“Can you tell me about the differences between the chosen, demigods, and gods,” I asked even as I slowly worked on the storage. It was a good opportunity to have a more detailed explanation. “Is it just about the power and capabilities?” </p><p>Her gaze showed that she didn’t exactly appreciate the question. “Do you think it’s the time to talk about it?” she asked. </p><p>“Well, it might be relevant to the storage I’m creating, but if you feel that it’s irrelevant…” I said, not even bothering to finish my sentences.</p><p>After all, why should I after poking her greatest need. </p><p>“Yes and no,” she answered. “While, ultimately, each category has great difference in power, the kind that needs great numbers to surpass, it’s a reflection of their different natures rather than being measured in power.” </p><p>“And…” I said, prompting her to continue. </p><p>“It’s about how they handle Divine Spark in their bodies. Chosen, like Titania and you, could only contain a sliver of Divine Spark, and that spark had to be locked into a special form, crystallized. It could only be used as a spell focus, helping the caster to amplify the spell effects, but only after the spell is already formed, and nothing more.” </p><p>I nodded. Her explanation was more or less accurate for Titania, though the Companion Nodes, which technically qualified them as Tantric Chosen, was a different issue. In the past, I had assumed that it was limited to the achievements it brought, but the recent lack of Perks confirmed that it was not a rule, but another trick from the system, tempting me to create them for some reason. </p><p>I made a note to talk with Helga about experimenting with those aspects. </p><p>“Demigods are different. They have a more intimate connection with the Divine Spark, to the point of allowing some flexibility on how to handle its existence. It doesn’t have to stay locked as a crystallized node, instead staying in its free-flowing state, usually restricted to a portion of the body depending on the preferred method of usage. And even use it to transform the mana in different ways, increasing their magical and martial flexibility significantly while also empowering the impact.” </p><p>Interesting, I thought, wondering about my trick with the Divine Spark, melting it to empower my body qualified as such. After all, it did look conceptually similar. The princess, on the other hand, was definitely on this stage, with her ability to create fake skills and extremely realistic puppets. </p><p>Of course, I doubted I would be able to find many demigods walking around with the System’s ability to immediately devour the Divine Spark. </p><p>In that aspect, Darkness Spark was a great exception. </p><p>“And how about Gods?” I asked, as I realized the headmistress suddenly stayed silent. </p><p>Interestingly, the plight of the headmistress looked different from both explanations. </p><p>She took a deep breath rather than answering, confirming my suspicions…</p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 630000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 7334 / 7334 Mana: 9000 / 9000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Grandmaster Tantric [114/140]</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [85/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Titania - Level 35/38]</p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Marianne - Level 21/29]</p>",

    "content": "<p>I spent some time, trying to decide on the most urgent direction to question her. Unfortunately, after her latest explosive statement, I had many directions to choose from: her transformation, the phoenixes and their strategic priorities, the objectives of the elven side, and the existence of the other dimension. </p><p>Whether she had any idea what this mysterious Threat was — albeit the naming sense gave me the impression that she didn’t… </p><p>Facing questions spreading to many directions, each more important than the others, I felt myself getting locked, losing myself in choice paralysis. It was not a common habit of mine, as I was more than capable of pushing through such arbitrary barriers and picking a direction to start first. Unfortunately, it took a moment for me to realize the reason for that uncharacteristic indecisiveness. </p><p>The growing sensation of power, spreading along my body, left a sensation not too dissimilar from getting tipsy, just enough to slow my decision-making. </p><p>How interesting, I thought, fascinated by the phenomenon. And, amusingly, distracted by that, I had failed to realize that my body continued its steady movement. </p><p>With a spectacular impact. </p><p>Cinder’s moan revealed that I wasn’t the only one getting lost in the baser side of the emotional spectrum. </p><p>And, if her delirious moans were any indicator, she wasn’t coping with it nearly as well as I was doing. Combined with my steady invasion, she was not too far away from another climax. Drunk with pleasure, any answer she might provide about my questions was suspect, requiring a follow-up later on to validate their accuracy.</p><p>Of course, pulling back and giving her some time to recover before I started asking those questions was an option… </p><p>Just an unappealing one, so I chose to go with a different option.</p><p>The exact opposite, in fact.  </p><p>“Since we started, it would be rude to stop halfway,” I murmured. Her response, wordless yet desperate, was enough to show her approach to that aspect. The combined pleasure of her transformation and her first time clearly had pushed her enough to compromise her ability to use words, but that didn’t change the intensity hidden in her desperate moan. </p><p>“You’re right,” I said with a chuckle, once again spanking her ass, enjoying the fact that, if I tried to do so an hour ago, she would have done her best to kill me rather than moan deliriously. </p><p>Let’s teach you the true meaning of pleasure,” I murmured even as I tightened my grip over her hips, pumping with shocking aggression that shook her beautiful body relentlessly, each second intensifying her beautiful moans, the pillow she buried her face in doing little to contain her voice. </p><p>Though, whether it was about the intensity of her pleasure, or the pillow’s compromised texture as it continued to burn was a different question — flames that we easily ignored thanks to the transformation. </p><p>Still, since I decided to finish our little encounter spectacularly, I didn’t show the slightest attempt to contain the reckless rush of my hips, showing the benefits of my enhanced stamina — which was already impressive beforehand — my hips moving like an enchanted drill, moving in and out, showing no signs of slowing down. </p><p>Which clearly earned her approval, as evidenced by the way her hips rose — as much as she could manage while pinned under me — to allow easier access as I slammed deep, my full weight behind every hit. </p><p>“Such a naughty phoenix,” I said with a chuckle even as I let my hands move in opposite directions. My left hand had a short journey, dipping down between her legs to massage her soft core, circling around her clit with a sudden yet relentless assault, adding another layer to her intense pleasure. </p><p>Which had been enough to trigger another climax, making another earthquake cover her beautiful skin, the flames that covered the full expanse of her body exploding intensely, enough to force me to refresh the spell that was keeping her bed intact — well, relatively intact. </p><p>If it wasn’t for the position of my right hand, that might have been enough to send her to the land of unconsciousness. My fingers tightened around her hair, the dancing flames tickling my skin as I tightened my hold and pulled her head back. </p><p>Hard enough for the jolt of pain to properly awaken her. </p><p>“Oh honey, it’s rude to leave the party early,” I said with a chuckle as I continued drilling without slowing my pace the slightest, her increased tightness elevating the already-spectacular pleasure to the next stage.</p><p>Her moans rose in response, soft and obedient. </p><p>“Let’s see your beautiful face,” I murmured after another minute as I suddenly pulled out and flipped her, not skipping a beat before skewering her beautiful core once more. </p><p>“N-no!” she gasped in shock, her voice colored with a beautiful tone of shame. She tried to cover her face with her hands, but I shifted my gaze and hold both. </p><p>Her response earned a chuckle. She folded her wings instead, which covered both her face and her breasts at the same time. </p><p>That would not do, I decided, no matter how beautiful the flames of passion that were dancing on the surface of her wings. Yet, rather than giving an order, I stopped grabbing her wrists and slipped under her wings, letting my fingers sink into her beautiful tits once more. </p><p>She gasped, and in her voice, I could hear an attempt to say something. Pity that died as I rammed into her core as hard as I could manage, her natural endurance making sure that it still stayed pleasurable rather than turning painful. </p><p>“P-please,” she managed to gasp after a while despite the combined pleasure. </p><p>“Please, what?” I asked, unable to hold back my chuckle. “Are you asking me to stop?” I asked. </p><p>Her response was spectacular. “No!” she gasped desperately, the intensity of desperation enough to convince a passerby that I was trying to kill her instead. The flames of her wings, exploding in intensity, just highlighted her frustration further. </p><p>“Oh sweetie, you need to show your beautiful face if you want me to continue,” I reminded her, and her wings twitched, showing that the intense emotions she was feeling weren’t enough to suppress the sudden bout of self-consciousness she found herself suffering. </p><p> Yet, that conflict only lasted a few seconds before she followed my direction, and slowly unveiled her face. </p><p>I had already seen the intensity of her pleasure on her face before, but that didn’t mean another glimpse was any less enjoyable as she revealed it once more, treating me to a beautiful mixture of shyness and joy. </p><p>“What a little horny phoenix,” I said as I twisted her nipples, occasionally interrupting with spanks on her beautiful tits. Unfortunately, that attempt was enough to destroy her partial recovery, and she found herself restricted to moans and grunts as the pleasure invaded her body completely. </p><p>She tried to shift to a more comfortable position, but I held her tightly, preventing her from moving as I once again alternated between her tight hole and her core. </p><p>It was about making her feel the full extent of pleasure, not lazy comfort. If I was going to stop my questioning, I was going to do so for a spectacular show.</p><p>My cock continued to jam into her tight hole, each push adding another small hint of intensity to her explosive moans, the little spaces in between barely enough for a desperate gasp to replenish her breath. </p><p>Yet, her desperate gulps of air didn’t prevent her from dancing at the edge of unconsciousness, even with the assistance of her supernatural resistance. </p><p>“That’s all?” I said with a chuckle as I spanked her breast once more, this time accompanied by a spell to enhance the stinging sensation, as she would have collapsed prematurely without that. “And here I am, thinking that the phoenixes are superior species, able to handle anything. Maybe I should seduce an elf next?” </p><p>Amusingly, the little dig worked much better than all my other tricks combined, triggering her flames — both literally and metaphorically — as she made an attempt to rose. </p><p>It was easily negated, the slightest pressure to her shoulder enough to keep her stable, but the renewed passion was enough to give her the necessary boost to stay conscious as I pushed forward once more, her tightness enough to bring me to the edge of a climax. </p><p>I pulled out of her tightness at the last second, targeting her face, spraying her beautiful face and tits with endless strings of my seed, the expression of outrage on her face beautiful as it mixed with her earlier flare. </p><p>Especially as one last twist of her nipple triggered a near-simultaneous climax for her, elevating the emotional cocktail to the next stage. </p><p>The confused expression on her face, resulting from a combination of arousal, exhaustion, and a sprinkle of sudden fury was amazing.</p><p>I watched her fall asleep, finally overwhelmed by the great challenge she had experienced, with a big smile. The flames that covered her skin slowly disappeared, yet the glow of her skin didn’t disappear completely, turning into a little soft glow…</p><p>It didn’t matter how many times it happened. Watching a pointlessly arrogant lady slowly losing all ability to resist pleasure, surrendering to me wholeheartedly, was always a pleasure.</p>",

    "content": "<p>City Center, Rome, Italy</p><p>A man in his seventies, wearing the ceremonial toga that distinguished him from the masses that filled the streets, as a member of the Roman Senate, walked through the crowded streets of Pomerium, the holy center of the Roman Republic, the strongest bastion of Imperium. </p><p>As an honored ex-Preator — one that didn’t carry the title ex-Consul only because he didn’t want to deal with the attention it would have brought to his plans, the kind that had little to benefit from political power — he walked the streets of Roman Pomerium almost every day, earning people’s gaze, one that was a mixture of envy and hatred as he walked with a deliberate slowness that would have been worthy of his position. </p><p>Yet, today was the exception. No one bothered to look at him, busy running around to avoid the chaos, nor he was in a mood to pay attention to it as he dashed forward with a speed that showed that despite his advanced age, he was not one of them that let himself go.</p><p>He didn’t have guards around him. </p><p>As a sorcerer at the peak, any guard around him was a decoration in any case, and they were tasked to handle more urgent tasks. </p><p>He hated the necessity that forced him to shed his genial old man attitude, one that he had only been able to maintain due to the great umbrella of his family, allowing him to act subtly. </p><p>Yet, today, he was forced to shed the harmless attitude that he had managed to develop for so long. </p><p>He had to, because his plans had just received a catastrophic hit. </p><p>The sorceress healer, with an expertise that was impossible to find anywhere but the lands of Cathay, one that required him to spend enough treasure to bankrupt several kingdoms; had been kidnapped.</p><p>The patrician class weapons that House Junia collected ever since the inception of Rome, stolen, acquired in civil wars, or taken from the great enemies of Rome; stolen and sold. </p><p>The grand collection of dragon hearts that he spent his whole life collecting to open the gates of the realm of Archmagus, to break through in a way that no one had done before to avoid the great restriction; spread around Pomerium like pebbles. </p><p>The guards he had raised to have a loyal force that wouldn’t blink before sacrificing themselves; slaughtered to the last man. </p><p>He slowed as he noticed one of the guard captains dashing toward him. “Speak,” he ordered. </p><p>“We have identified the location of most of the weapons. Two of them were hidden in carts that were leaving Rome when their protective spells failed, and we already acquired them. But the rest of the weapons are spread around the lower city, every single one of them behind some wards, and the guards lack the strength to breach through the defenses.” </p><p>“And they are not following our orders to give them back,” he growled in anger as he looked at the guard. </p><p>The guard answered reluctantly. “No, sir.” </p><p>He took a deep breath, trying to suppress the anger that was growing inside him. “It seems that we have acted subtly too long, and they forgot who’s the true leader of the city, saving from tyranny again and again,” he muttered, unable to prevent the latter half from turning into a growl as he felt his power stirring, responding to his anger. </p><p>He took a deep breath, suppressing that sudden flash. He didn’t dare to let his power go amok, not with his breakthrough so close. The breakthrough of the Archmagus might be an incredible opportunity for others, but he had other considerations. </p><p>Considerations that were ruined by the others. “And what about the ones responsible for the raid? Any evidence about the perpetrator.” </p><p>“No, sir,” the guard answered with a trembling voice. “We were able to trace their presence to Dacian School, but we found the representatives of several families murdered and hacked into pieces.” </p><p>The ex-Preator listened as the guard gave him the list of identified families. “Any idea who is the responsible party, and who is the supporters?” he asked. </p><p>“No, sir. People had a man riding away from the place, using a spear, strong enough to destroy the spells of the others that tried to keep them using wards, but —“ he started, before getting interrupted. </p><p>“A spear, any description,” he asked, tensing more and more as the description reached his ear as the guard gave a detailed description of the spear. “That old codger,” he growled in anger. “I should have expected that his useless bloodline somehow intervenes,” he growled. </p><p>“Old codger, sir?” asked the guard. </p><p>“Not important,” he waved his hand. “But I don’t understand who could use—“ he murmured, then froze as the realization hit. “Only a senile idiot like him would dare to actually use a bestowment ritual on a bastard.” </p><p>“Should we send more after him.” </p><p>“No,” he answered as he shook his head. “Only an idiot would try to escape our attention by riding a Nemean lion and openly using a spear, thinking that speed would help him. And such a madman could never breach our defenses without we could realize it. Someone who’s aware of my feud is using that as a distraction while they safely sold the rest of the items.” </p><p>“Several weaker houses claiming that someone had just dropped the items with them,” the guard interrupted. </p><p>“Nonsense, you told me that almost all of them were already in Rome,” he growled, dismissing the possibility. After all, who would go to the trouble of stealing from House Junia, only to throw away a treasury that would tempt even the biggest Empires to go to war? </p><p>Rome had certainly done so in the past.</p><p>“But what if —“ the guard tried to answer, only to be interrupted. </p><p>“Enough, send a message to the legions that are loyal to us, and ask them to mobilize. We might need their direct intervention.” </p><p>“But if we do that, we can trigger a civil war—“ the guard answered, and got interrupted again, this time by a flare of magic. </p><p>“You have your orders, go,” he ordered as he continued walking toward the center of Pomerium, where he could feel the power of several dragon hearts collected to one central location, mixed with the aura of a few Patrician weapons. </p><p>He soon arrived in front of the building that the power was radiating off from, one that belonged to House Furia, one of the patrician houses that still had the delusions of competing with House Junia — even after the number of times he had taught them the futility of that action. </p><p>No wonder they were daring enough to raid his Estate.</p><p>The house was surrounded by guards and gladiators carrying the mark of House Junia. Guards that dared to loiter around despite his orders rushed whenever they discovered a sign of his treasured items. </p><p>He once again cursed the loss of his loyal guards. The loss of treasures that took centuries for House Junia to collect was bad enough, but the loss of the force he raised to intervene in such circumstances only made the situation worse. </p><p>Their undying loyalty was to be used as a hammer to break the resistance of the others before he intervened, intimidating the arrogance of the ones that treated House Junia, forgetting that they were responsible for killing the last king of Rome, and they were responsible for many arrogant politicians with delusions of bringing back the monarchy. </p><p>Like as that upstart Julius Caesar or his incompetent nephew. </p><p>As he looked at the residence of House Furia, he couldn’t but feel shocked, still unable to understand how his plans had been compromised to such a degree. Such a radical reaction was clearly the indicator that someone had realized his monumental plan of breaking to become an Archmagus in a way that had been never tried before.</p><p>Becoming the first Archmagus that was able to act freely, without Gaia’s intervention, marked the beginning of the true dominance of the Junia family. </p><p>Giving Rome the undying king it deserved, and finally crushing the Eastern Empire.</p><p>Yet, just as he was months away from that grand success, someone ruined his plans, spreading around his tools. </p><p>He didn’t care much about the Patrician weapons, as despite the legends about their roots, he failed to leverage them to his purpose — their unique nature rejecting his control, his age making bestowment rituals impossible to work. </p><p>And, it was impossible to achieve what he wanted without multiple weapons working in conjunction, an achievement that looked impossible. </p><p>But, that meant that gathering the dragon hearts was even more important, especially the biggest piece that carried the power of lightning, outside of Gaia’s control... </p><p>“What are you waiting for?” he ordered at the guard that stood helplessly. “Attack—” he ordered, only to be interrupted by an unwelcome voice.  </p><p>“Oh, what a nice surprise. My colleague, ex-Preator Brutus is here,” said an unwelcome voice, and when he raised his gaze, only to see the Patrician of House Furia, a man in his forties, looking from the window, a mocking smile on his face. </p><p>A man that thought himself to superior to everyone just because he was the Consul this year. “Why didn’t you send a message, informing me that you wanted to pay a visit? I would have prepared a greeting for you.” </p><p>“Do you dare to play around after being daring enough to enter House Junia and steal my treasures,” he growled, his face contorted with anger. </p><p>Yet, his opponent only chuckled, which didn’t help his anger. He let his power grow, getting more and more intense, enough to break through the suppression of Pomerium’s wards. </p><p>Yet, even as he broke those wards, he could feel a certain energy stirring underneath, one that tempted him to reach and grab it, promising endless capabilities. </p><p>The power of an Archmagus. </p><p>Too bad those came with chains impossible to break. Chains that he spent half of his life trying to avoid. </p><p>Yet, a sorcerer reaching the great limit was dangerous enough without taking that eternal step. </p><p>Unfortunately, he didn’t get the reaction he had been searching for. “You have hidden well,” commented his arrogant opponent, one that made him tense even before his opponent was joined by a second aura. </p><p>He smirked, confident enough to take down two sorcerers. Pity that was short-lived, as his opponent was joined by a third one. Then, auras reached five, then seven… </p><p>Only to stop when nine auras stood against his, each one of them a sorcerer. “Luckily, I have friends here,” he commented lazily. </p><p>Brutus saw eight other men walking into his field of view, each from one of the houses that were struggling to regain their past position. </p><p>It seemed that they had finally decided to stop dawdling and hit back. </p><p>And did so perfectly. </p><p>Brutus was confident in his power. He was arguably the strongest living Sorcerer in Rome, maybe even in the world, but even for him, one against nine would be impossible odds. </p><p>He had the choice to retreat, but doing so would mean giving up the lightning dragon heart that he worked so hard to acquire. </p><p>He could gather enough forces to squash nine sorcerers, but not before they could successfully smuggle the dragon heart he desperately needed. And, when facing one against nine, even he was helpless. </p><p>Unless he took a crazy risk… </p><p>He reached his power, touching the barrier that kept him from the infinite power bubbling all along Earth, willing to take the risk of using the incomplete experiment records. All he needed was to acquire the dragon heart they were hoping to hide behind nine of them. </p><p>Spending his life on the edge of ascension, taking that last step was simple, elevating him to the rank of Archmagus. </p><p>Yet, even as his power exploded, allowing him to kill five of his nine opponents sorcerer’s in one spell before they could even react, he felt the bindings of Gaia wrap around him, suppressing his power…</p><p>And, underneath Rome, he could feel other, comparable powers, reacting to his presence… </p>",

    "content": "<p>As the clock hit zero and we walked back to the locker room, a weird atmosphere filled the room, so much had an observer wouldn’t ever believe we were ahead. Offensive players were looking at us angrily like we had burned all of their houses and banged their wives on the smoldering remains. </p><p>Our score came thanks to a last-second touchdown by one of our receivers slipping away, though that had been only possible because the opponent's defense replicated our earlier trick, unlike us, they didn’t particularly care about actually defending the ball, using the opportunity to hit our offensive players as hard as possible. </p><p>Our starting quarterback was limping badly, and so were two of our receivers and one of the running backs.</p><p>They shouldn’t have been hurt that much just by a couple of plays, no matter how harsh, but their weak training regime was costing them. After all, there was also an art to getting tackled, an art that they were not particularly competent at. </p><p>Combined with their unfamiliarity with pain, their situation was literally torture. </p><p>In contrast, every single defensive player had smirks on their face, enjoying the pain the offensive team found themselves in. </p><p>Their elation was easy to understand. As a defense, we played amazingly, not allowing them to score not even once, and despite our offense’s best attempts to ruin the game, we were still leading. </p><p>Yet, seeing Coach Spencer’s growing anger as he walked away phone in hand, looking at me, I had a sinking feeling. A guy with both authority and money was a dangerous combination, especially without a corresponding sense of responsibility. </p><p>Maybe I shouldn’t have pushed it too much. </p><p>As he walked away, I closed my eyes and touched the system, receiving the rest of the Traits I managed to earn on the field. </p><p>[Strategy V]</p><p>[Tactics V]</p><p>[Pattern Recognition V]</p><p>[Calculation V]</p><p>[Leadership V]</p><p>[Endurance III]</p><p>[Recovery III]</p><p>[Speed III]</p><p>[Strength IV]</p><p>[Agility IV]</p><p>Though, looking at the notifications that invaded my field of vision, I had to admit that, even if I knew how it would end, I would do the same. </p><p>First, Coach Spencer was clearly not just angry at me, but the defense in general, meaning I wouldn’t be the only one that suffered his wrath. </p><p>Second, even if he did so, the worst thing he could do was to kick me out of the school. </p><p>It might have been a threat that would scare me a day ago. But now, after all those improvements, I was significantly less afraid of said threat. </p><p>After all, just the improvements in my physical traits were enough to get a full scholarship in a new college, not to mention I could easily try out for a professional team. With those traits, I had an excellent chance to actually make it. </p><p>And the less it was said about the potential improvements from the more mental aspects like Calculation and Leadership and the options they provided to me, the better. </p><p>“Not a bad game,” I heard the familiar voice of Coach Bill who walked toward us, paying us a compliment, which was as rare as a full eclipse. We must have really impressed him. “But for the second half, I expect them to play an even heavier run game…” </p><p>I barely paid attention to his explanations, the latest improvements in my mental abilities enough to make his explanation superfluous. </p><p>Instead, I started thinking about the improvements I had received. Particularly, why no Traits had managed to surpass stage five even though most of them managed to hit the said limit, and despite the different improvements I expected to receive. </p><p>Maybe there was a reason for that, or maybe there was something I needed to unlock the next stages. </p><p>When we walked back to the field, the audience was cheering crazily as we stepped on the field…</p><p>“Let’s show them what we are made of,” I growled as we walked on the field after the kickoff, as it was our opponent’s turn on the offensive side. Yet, when we lined against them, my gaze allowed me to catch a very welcome detail on the gaze of the opposing quarterback. </p><p>Fear. </p><p>It hurt my pride slightly to see his gaze bouncing between Thad and Carter rather than looking at me, the architect of his suffering. </p><p>That would not do. </p><p>I called a couple adjustments quickly, sending Thad to the right wings, and pulled Carter to the left wing, aligning the position just like the previous time, where he ended up as a painful sandwich. </p><p>His reaction was to pull one of the tight ends to his side to support the running back, creating even stronger protection for him. It wasn’t a horrible play, he could give the ball to either of them for a run, or try to charge through the center himself. And, a pass was always an option with the extra time his protection would give him. </p><p>Too bad for him that it left the center defense weak, confident that it wouldn’t fall since I was the only one in the center. </p><p>At the start of the game, it would have been a good choice. After all, a subpar middle linebacker against a right guard and a center was an inevitable end. Unfortunately for him, there was a great difference between my strength at the beginning of the game and the second half, where I had been fed by the fanatical cries of fifty thousand people. </p><p>Although I didn’t have a proper opportunity to test my new physical capabilities properly, the little discrete tests I conducted suggested that I was at a point I could easily compete against professional talents. </p><p>Pity I couldn’t reflect on the full extent of my abilities without raising too much suspicion, but there was no harm in a subtle burst in the middle of the game, especially when it could be easily mistaken for a mistake of my opponent. </p><p>The moment they snapped the ball, I charged forward, directly between the right guard and the center, looking like I was going to take both of them at the same time. </p><p>Yet, just before I slammed both of them at the same time, I took a step to the side. It sounded simple, but doing so while charging forward full speed, especially when I had lowered my center of gravity to maintain my balance after collusion, was much more difficult. </p><p>The only reason I was able to successfully achieve this was the dangerous combination of Speed and Agility, giving me the quick feet of a top-tier cornerback — but with a strength that would make a lineman jealous. </p><p>So, facing the unlucky right guard that didn’t expect to meet with such a move, I didn’t even need to use my full power. </p><p>I pressed my hand against his shoulder, and a gentle push was enough to push him back — conveniently positioning him in between me and the center that wanted to prevent my charge. </p><p>Then, I was face to face with the quarterback, his fear impossible to hide. </p><p>The kind of fear that triggered stupid decisions, like trying to throw the ball he was holding. After all, it was forbidden to tackle a quarterback who was not holding the ball. </p><p>Yet, from the beginning, I wasn’t aiming at the man, but the ball he was holding. Halfway to his throw, my hands were around the ball, and I pulled it off.</p><p>When the running back that was responsible for defending the quarterback realized that Carter wasn’t the main threat he needed to deal with, it was already too late. I started running forward, the thirty-yard distance nothing to my full speed. </p><p>I moved slower than my full capability, letting the running back catch up with me, only to put my hand on his shoulder and push him away, which sent him away like a ragdoll. </p><p>Then, just as I was about to take a step into the end zone, I jumped, delivering a full somersault, landing in the end zone with both feet. </p><p>“Touchdown!” I cried in elation as I raised the ball and spiked it down hard, and the team was around me before it could hit on the floor, and the celebration started. </p><p>I appreciated their presence, but not as much as the great wave of Intent I received as the audience cheered wildly, the show I had just put just the kind they appreciated, violent pushes, a desperate run, and most importantly, a beautiful score. </p><p>[Endurance V]</p><p>[Recovery V]</p><p>[Speed V]</p><p>[Strength V]</p><p>[Agility V]</p><p>One that brought me rewards that were much greater than I expected. </p><p>I had long realized that every increment had required several times more Intent than the previous progress, and the physical ones took much more than the mental ones to improve. Yet, one play — admittedly a glorious one — had been enough to push me to the next stage without the slightest problem. </p><p>There was really no substitute. </p><p>Interestingly, even that great amount didn’t improve any of those Traits above the earlier limit, suggesting that stage five was a limit — a soft one considering how my guide had dismissed the little improvement given by it. </p><p>That was an issue for a different time, I decided as I returned to the sidelines. </p><p>After that play, the rest of the game progressed rather predictably. The strip-sack worked wonders to demoralize them, forcing them to rely aggressively on the running plays just to avoid a similar disaster. </p><p>And, without courage, it was impossible for them to score. </p><p>Meaning, that even for our pathetic offensive squad, it was difficult to lose the game. And they managed to hold on to the ball even as the opponent's defense attacked them harder and harder in revenge. </p><p>Seeing our dear comrades hurt on the field saddened the defensive squad greatly, but we managed to hold back our tears, to respect their great sacrifice. </p><p>Then, the match ended, 31-7. </p><p>Total domination.</p>",

    "content": "<p>“So, tell me, why do you think I’m here, wasting my time with you?” I said, letting amusement infect my tone as I did so, leaning against my chair even more to enjoy my comfort. </p><p>It was a subtle and efficient power move even under the conditions where I didn’t have a barely dressed princess in front of me, leaning back on the giant pillow. </p><p>As I looked at her beautiful visage, I knew that defining the moment as disappointing was certainly unfair — even though the presence of her corset covered more than I would have liked even in its loose state, making me wish for a more provocative set, maybe with more lace or simply less fabric. </p><p>The cream-colored corset she wore was stylistic, but it was certainly not chosen to maximize the attraction but comfort — reasonable, as she didn’t expect to interact with me at all. Luckily, she had amazing curves that showed through even that boring corset — and the fact that it was loose created a cleavage where there was supposed to be none.</p><p>She shuffled slightly, savvy enough to catch the subtle tone in my words as she looked at me, letting me enjoy her changing perception. I didn’t push the erotic undertone in my voice much, and just uttered it enough to give her an option, curious whether she would be as enthusiastic to weaponize it without the disguises and magical puppets. </p><p>The answer turned out to be negative. “You want to see whether I’m a risk toward Silver Spires and your coworker,” she guessed as she shuffled, carefully stepping away from the insinuation in a way she thought as subtle — only to be sabotaged by the restrictions on her abilities. </p><p>She seemed less willing to use seduction as a weapon without her tricks to give her a layer of plausible deniability. </p><p>Yet, even more amusingly, despite her ultimate preference, the decision didn’t come quickly. She lingered on the question for a while — a deliberation process that might as well be an open book with her compromised fake skills — influenced by her body captivated by arousal. </p><p>Amused by her struggle, I let her answer slide without pushing back. “Such arrogance,” I said with a chuckle. “To think that you can actually present a threat to our organization, even to a junior peripheral member,” I said, reinforcing the impression that we were stronger than she might have thought. </p><p>A risky approach, but I needed her to assume that I was a threat, to create leverage I could use to slowly convert her to my side. My need for her was less about her role as a princess — no matter how inconvenient a battle for the throne — and more about her potential knowledge about the Eternals and the intricacies of her abilities. </p><p>Of course, even those reasons were secondary compared to the real reason I needed her. I wanted to learn where she managed to find the Darkness Spark and where to find more Divine Spark — a fact that she must know considering the research project she funded. </p><p>I hoped that it wasn’t just preparation to rob the Headmistress and something more. </p><p>“Then, what?” she asked. </p><p>“I was just curious about the naughty girl that dared to break into my coworker’s office and try to suborn her loyal followers through fake magical puppets and disguises,” I said, enjoying the way she tensed as her tricks unraveled more and more. </p><p>With the sole exception of her fake skills, giving her the impression that it was still secret. </p><p>It was never a good idea to push someone against a wall — metaphorically, of course, as it was quite fun when done literally. </p><p>“You have seen it, now what?” she asked. </p><p>“Now, I want to understand why a little faction of the Eternals is bothering to slowly dismantle your organization slowly rather than getting rid of you directly. Do you think they believe your little handmaiden trick?” I asked. </p><p>“They must have been,” she said, her voice carrying no hint of surprise, which confirmed to me that she had a reasonably accurate idea about the strength of the Eternals as she didn’t even react when I mentioned it was a little faction that was bothering her. “Otherwise, they would have just swooped down and got rid of me.” </p><p>I nodded as I heard the honest conclusion in her tone, abandoning that direction. Of course, just because she thought that was the case didn’t actually make it so, but talking with her about that was not exactly the most efficient way of exploring that. </p><p>“Good,” I said dismissively. “So, since I’m here, let me leave you with some honest advice. Your actions in Silver Spires are amusing,” I said as I stood up, took a couple steps toward the door, and started to disappear, using an illusion that looked like Teleportation from outside. Yet, before delivering that, I turned to look at her one last time. “Make sure that amusement doesn’t evolve into irritation.” </p><p>The sudden stiffening in her posture showed that she received my message perfectly, the worry on her face implying that her initial plans weren’t as harmless to Silver Spires as I might have hoped. </p><p>It seemed that a visit from the mysterious stranger was still my best trick. </p><p>I expected to disappear after completing my objectives, only for that expectation to be ruined by the princess jumping up to her feet and panicked a moment later. “W-wait,” she shouted as she landed on her feet — an ill-advised move that further challenged the ability of her clothing to hide her beautiful assets as they reacted to the sudden movement. </p><p>I followed that request and dispelled the illusion — though not neglecting the pump of some mana in the room that was similar to what would remain after teleportation to make sure it looked genuine. </p><p>In acting, details were everything. </p><p>“Was that an order,” I said with chilly anger as I looked at her, and she took a fearful step behind, mistaking that for a genuine one. </p><p>“N-no!” she gasped in fear, only relaxing after my expression turned neutral. “I have an offer for your organization.” </p><p>“You’re wildly overestimating yourself if you think you have anything that would actually work in a bargain.” </p><p>“I…” she whispered before taking a deep breath. “I’m willing to give my full loyalty to your organization if you help me take the throne,” she said. </p><p>I chuckled. “As I said, you’re wildly overestimating yourself if you think we care about a little carcass of an Empire, let alone who is actually saddled with the pointless task of ruling it.” </p><p>Interestingly, her expression made me glad that I had interfered with the skills she hoped to use, because it meant that, when I saw a lack of reaction, I could be sure it was a genuine reaction rather than an elaborate trick. </p><p>“What if I offer something better in exchange for helping me to get the throne?” </p><p>This time, I fully turned toward her. “I have a feeling that you’re again overestimating the value of your trinkets, but go ahead,” I said, but just as she opened her mouth, I interrupted again. “But start dancing as you speak, so at least it won’t be a waste of my time.” </p><p>Her sudden hesitant expression was beautiful, especially after the effective seduction attempts she delivered when she was disguised as Delia. Maybe she was relying on the disguise of a clutch to separate herself from her actions. </p><p>She wouldn’t be the first girl I interacted with that did so, albeit hard to that degree. </p><p>“Are you—“ she started, only to abandon that question when my expression stiffened, and she started swaying her body to an invisible song. Her body moved smoothly, showing that her training as a princess definitely included dancing — that, or she had learned to increase Delia’s power of attraction. </p><p>“Good,” I said as I let my gaze drag along her body, pushing a mild amusement to my face rather than arousal, which helped her to forget her shame, replacing that with impotent fury. </p><p>She didn’t let her annoyance stop her dancing. On the contrary, she started swaying faster and faster, her movements getting more and more fluid as she struggled to change my expression — her state on the edge once again helping to keep her on the edge. </p><p>“I have discovered some ruins belonging to the Eternals,” she explained. I said nothing even as she paused, struggling to hide my reaction. It was certainly valuable information, the kind that she could never voluntarily reveal under better circumstances. Revealing her biggest secret was a mistake.  </p><p>Not that I blamed her for her mistake. Her fear, arousal, and shock worked wonders to block her decision-making, and her compromised fake skills just pushed it forward more. </p><p>The existence of ruins was not a surprise, as the ruined spear was the evidence of such a discovery, but I had been assuming that it was the extent of their discovery — and with everything going on, exploring the origin of the spear didn’t get any attention. </p><p>Considering her words, it was clearly a mistake. “And I’m interested in that, why?” I asked, hiding my reaction. </p><p>“Because its defensive wards are still standing even after centuries, and other than the outer perimeter, it’s untouched.” </p><p>“Interesting,” I said. “And is your Divine Spark also sourced from there?” I asked, only for her to freeze in shock while her fake soul space trembled as her control slipped. </p><p>“Y-yes,” she managed to stammer as her dancing stopped. </p><p>“Good, you might have earned some assistance,” I said before gathering my mana, using my teleportation perk to send some air into the Aether Dimension while I hid my presence with illusions, and left the room through the wards while the princess was distracted by my display. </p><p>[-1829 Mana]</p><p>I didn’t force her to tell me the location of the ruins, or promise help, because first, I needed to assess the risk. </p><p>Any ward that managed to survive despite the existence of the System, constantly devouring mana, was not something that could be tackled easily. And that was before factoring in the Eternals interfering. </p><p>After all, it was very likely that the only reason a faction of Eternals interfered with her was her knowledge about those ruins. </p><p>Risks all around…</p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 630000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 7334 / 7334 Mana: 9000 / 9000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Grandmaster Tantric [114/140]</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [85/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Titania - Level 35/38]</p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Marianne - Level 21/29]</p>",

    "content": "<p>The silence stretched once more after my answer. </p><p>I let it linger, giving her the time to process that there was more than one mysterious organization that was interfering with the workings of her little Empire without showing the slightest respect to its supposedly-exalted nature. </p><p>“So, which organization do you belong to if not with them,” the princess said, doing her best not to give any information, but the great difference in our current skill configuration working against her. </p><p>The brute force approach was not just useful for combat but also for more political activities. My overwhelming speech and subterfuge allowed me to detect the undercurrents of the word ‘them’, loaded with hatred and fear, but no mystery. </p><p>It was clear that she was aware of the identity of the Eternals and their position in the world, at least to a certain degree in terms of their domination of the Material Plane. Whether her information included their dubious struggle against the gods was a mystery. </p><p>Yet, she avoided mentioning their name, clearly not intending to volunteer any information, no matter how small. </p><p>Interesting strategy. </p><p>Unfortunately for her, she was not the only one that could play that game. Rather than answering her question, I let out a soft, dismissive snort, which was all I needed to inform her that she was not worthy of questioning my origins. </p><p>I was happy to see that the first thing my reaction brought out of her was angry, even though she had managed to hide it behind the calm geniality that was cultivated by a lifetime of training. It meant that there was a fire to support her ambitions, the ambitions that forced her to fight against difficult odds rather than using her abilities to disappear.</p><p> A view that was enhanced by her improperly loose corset as she took a deep breath, enhancing her cleavage even further. </p><p>Yet, I felt a flicker of mana from her, one that was only possible as I was continuously observing her Soul Space. She pulled her mana to her Soul Space, letting it dance in her core before pushing outward, and started building her fake soul space once more. </p><p>I was impressed, both by her daring to create such an attempt against me, and by the subtlety of such an attempt. I might have missed it if it wasn’t for my mana already lodged deep into her Soul Space, giving me real-time observation of what she was doing. </p><p>As the mana danced in her core, I watched as it transform. Mana was normally bright and filled with energy, but as it dragged in her Soul Space, it slowly lost its more noticeable qualities, turning almost invisible. </p><p>Between a shadow and a whisper. </p><p>It was a simple nature transformation, but watching it happen slowly rather than through a skill shortcut was interesting. Well, more accurately, it was through a different shortcut, as it was still much simpler than actually forcing such a transformation with the skill blocked. </p><p>The purity of it, however, looked even better than what could be achieved through the skills. Though I had no idea whether it was about her application method, or an illusion that was about the nature of the darkness mana. </p><p>Unfortunately, I lacked the ability to compare. </p><p>Yet, while both the process and the results were interesting, I couldn’t say the same for the flexibility of her application. Despite the impressiveness of the result as she slowly built up her fake soul space, her ability could best be defined as fumbling in the dark — I thought as I forced myself to hold my chuckle back at the unintended pun. </p><p>She wasn’t incompetent, of course. But her actions showed she lacked my ability to look inward and analyze her own soul space at the same time, yet she was familiar enough to be clearly checked it before. </p><p>My best guess was that she had used her fake skills to maximize her detection capabilities to examine it, until she developed a method to fumble in the dark. </p><p>“How can I help you, then,” she asked after half a minute of silence, trying to reframe the situation once again. Extending unrestricted favors to strange men was hardly the smartest strategy, but still, it was a reasonable attempt for her to understand my objectives. </p><p>Especially since my barging implied that she couldn’t exactly reject me if I pushed. </p><p>“Ah, the arrogance of the nobles. Do you think there’s anything you can do that I would actually care about?” I said, followed by an extended sigh that made her tense, which made her focus on the construction of her soul space even faster. Which was exactly what I wanted, as her speedy construction made the process even easier to decipher for me. </p><p>Just to extend the pressure a bit more, I removed my hood, though not before casting a spell to change my face, turning it into a generic man in his early fifties. </p><p>Though, even as I watched her fake soul space settle over her real one, obscuring the presence of the Darkness Spark — which was undiminished by the process, showing that Divine Spark was not an expandable resource like mana during the process — and her real soul space, and the fake skills started to appear. </p><p>Interesting, I thought as I took a note of the changes, including the expansion of her mana reservoirs, though the speed they filled was certainly underwhelming. </p><p>She lacked a perk similar to my Mana Regeneration. I wondered whether it was the lack of knowledge that was holding her back, or it was a limit to her faking ability. </p><p>While the process had been interesting, the same couldn’t be said for the results. Her new fake level barely reached fifteen, which was hardly the greatest improvement, but that didn’t mean it was a wasted effort. Her new skills were split between Speech and Subterfuge, and her stats shifted heavily into Charisma and Manipulation, giving her the ability to manipulate the conversation better. </p><p>Well, at least it would have if I didn’t use the opportunity to throttle the effects of her skills and stats like I had done against Oeyne during our game. </p><p>The fun thing, since those skills and stats were much subtler than Strength and other physical stats, the princess didn’t even realize that manipulation, still under the impression that she received the boost ability. </p><p>Leaving her overconfident in her new abilities. </p><p>To make things even more advantageous, pushing her into the perilous waters of overconfidence was just a side benefit. The real benefit was watching her create those fake skills, tricking the system. </p><p>The process was interesting, both easier and harder than I had expected. The first thing I noticed was the automatic nature of the process. She was the one that provided the mana to create the fake soul space and the skills, but she certainly lacked the ability to form the intricate nature of her skills, meaning that her rough control only created a seed for her skills, and the System handled the rest. </p><p>No, I corrected it a moment later. Her mana didn’t just use to create a seed, but also fed into the System, duplicating the effects of the experience, which clearly made it much harder for her to level up. </p><p>After all, leveling up had two fundamental aspects, the ever-growing experience requirement for higher levels, and — for the lack of a better term — the quality and the strength of the experience source, which led to the classification of beasts. </p><p>A fact that I had used my tantric skill to validate, confirming that a part of the soul space of the beasts had been devoured directly through the soul space of the slayer while most of it disappeared onto the air. </p><p>Of course, my knowledge about the system had been significantly limited at that time, and I had assumed the rest of whatever the beasts contained was dispersing back into nature. But, after the discoveries about how the System constantly absorbed the mana and divine spark all across the material plane, I had long realized that it was an inaccurate solution. </p><p>The system absorbed the Soul Space equivalent directly while a small portion was absorbed by the attacker, working more as a proof of achievement to record — hence the amount that was absorbed not exactly helping. </p><p>As far as I could see, her technique was using her Darkness mana to replicate the signature of monster kills, earning rapid reward from the System, creating her fake skills. </p><p>Or maybe, it was more accurate to define them as temporary skills, similar to my own perk-provided specialized ones. Still, their temporary nature came from the fact that they were created from her transformed mana, and required a constant feed of mana to maintain.</p><p>Which meant my earlier guesses about its usability were correct. The stronger the skills and higher the level, the more mana was required to sustain, putting a time limit. As far as I could see, she could use external mana — like the one that was stored in her complicated vase — to trigger her high level. </p><p>The same freedom didn’t apply to maintaining. As its growth stabilized, the new Soul Space couldn’t use its own fake reservoir or outside mana to support itself — though, based on my own tantric experience, I could see that it was mostly about her lack of ability to manipulate her own Soul Space rather than a theoretical restriction. </p><p>I was tempted to test that directly but I decided to leave that research project for a later date, giving myself more time to observe the princess first. I already had enough projects to deal with. </p><p>Still, that decision was unrelated to the chill that covered my insides. </p><p>Altogether, it was supposed to be a great discovery, but realizing the ease with the System could be manipulated by another Divine Spark actually scared me. Not because it meant Tantric was not unique in that aspect — a fact that I was already aware of — but because it only made me adjust my estimation about the Eternals. </p><p>Even if their control over the System was imperfect, how much power they could manage to gather after hundreds of dominance? </p><p>A tough question, though one that was best left another time. </p><p>I still had a tense, barely dressed princess to pay attention to. A barely dressed princess that was under the impression that she had just received a great boost to her Speech and Subterfuge to handle a dangerously political conversation…</p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 630000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 7334 / 7334 Mana: 9000 / 9000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Grandmaster Tantric [114/140]</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [85/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Titania - Level 35/38]</p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Marianne - Level 21/29]</p>",

    "content": "<p>I found Nancy in the bed, still naked, the cover pulled haphazardly to the half of her chest, barely hiding her perfect breasts. Her skin shone on the crisp covers, while her beautiful red hair sprawled over the bed, giving a much-needed contrast to make it a striking view. </p><p>If it wasn’t for the great shock in her beautiful green eyes while she furiously browsed her phone, I would have assumed it to be an intentional pose, tempting me for some early morning fun. </p><p>Albeit, knowing the source of her shock, I wasn’t exactly surprised. </p><p>“Impossible,” she gasped repeatedly as I closed the door and walked toward her at the cost of isolating us from the fun Penny and Laura might have in the other room. Watching them was fun, but it was a level of fun I could forgo to deal with business aspects with Nancy — especially considering the great financial implications it held. </p><p>“Why don’t you tell me what’s impossible, sweetie,” I said as I took a seat next to her. </p><p>She looked at me blankly, not even noticing that as she shuffled, the covers slipped down to reveal her beautiful breasts completely, still carrying the bruises from the last night’s adventure. “The sales number of my book, there has to be a mistake.” </p><p>“Really, why don’t you pass it to me so I can check it,” I said, and took her phone before she could even answer, checking the dashboard. </p><p>I had to admit, I actually had to count the number of digits to make sure I was seeing correctly. Based on the number of mentions, I was expecting four digits. Selling a couple thousand books was certainly a small measure of success, but doing so in less than twenty-four hours was impressive even with a huge marketing campaign. </p><p>Without that, it was a small miracle. </p><p>Yet, on the screen, I could see a large miracle, consisting of five whole digits, not exactly the low end as well. However, while I understood the enormity of the success, I was also sufficiently familiar enough with such numbers — though, until the moment exclusively for other’s businesses with no profit sharing — to hide my surprise. </p><p>Not to mention, my earlier browsing prepared me for the great success we would have on the book angle as well. Not to this level, certainly, but my shock was certainly not about the money I made. Even after selling in mid-five figures, it didn’t make as much money as the private photo sets I was selling. Still, the cut I would take was a nice boost. </p><p>“Yeah, a good start,” I said casually as I passed it back to her. </p><p>“S-start,” she gasped in shock as she looked at me, her eyes wide in shock. “What do you mean it’s a start? Forty thousand books —“ she tried to continue, only to be silenced as I pressed my hand on her lips. </p><p>“I know how to read, sweetheart, but that was my point, it’s just a start. It’s just the start of success.” </p><p>“But —“ she started, only to be silenced once more, this time by a flick to her nipple. </p><p>“Cut it out. This is just a start,” I said. “Didn’t I tell you that you will have success as long as you trust me,” I said, acting like I hadn’t been struggling to get a fraction of that money just days ago.</p><p>“I … see,” she murmured, still unable to process the financial implications of our great achievement.  </p><p>“We just need to decide the best way to use this as a starting point, to see whether we could reach a number that we can call successful.” </p><p>“N-nonsense,” she stammered in shock. “What is success if over forty thousand doesn’t qualify as one?” </p><p>I shrugged. “I’m not exactly a master of book publishing, but if it was a magazine, ten million yearly,” I said, throwing a deliberately aggressive number, one that was only possible for some of the more successful international magazines. “So, maybe we should aim for a million, for a start.” </p><p>I couldn’t help it. After the great success that completely changed my financial state, I was feeling rather ambitious. </p><p>“A m-million. T-to start,” she gasped, her beautiful green eyes even wider. “You’re crazy.” Yet, even as she declared that, I could see her believing my words. </p><p>It was good, as while I was being ambitious, I actually trusted to reach such a number, though it would mean investing most of the money we made back into marketing, maybe even forcing me to spend some extra from the money I was making from selling the bonus photo set. </p><p>After all, they were two businesses reinforcing each other. No harm in supporting it a bit more.</p><p> Especially since it would put Nancy deeper into my debt, which was always nice leverage to have over such a passionate model. Not that I would use to push her, but sometimes, it was enough to have the leverage.  </p><p>“Well, then it means you’re in the bed with a crazy person,” I said as I tugged her covers, revealing her naked body, showing that it wasn’t just a figurative statement. </p><p>She opened her mouth, but before she could say anything, my lips were over hers, capturing them in a searing kiss that would unbalance her further. </p><p>I had a smirk on my face as I pulled back. “Though, I’m certainly glad we signed the contract that clearly outlines my share and responsibilities,” I said, making her eyes widen. </p><p>“Oh, honey, don’t tell me you forgot that part, or think that I’m going to arrange a marketing campaign for free,” I whispered. “I’m not saying you’re not beautiful enough to make it worthwhile, but I have my professional needs. Don’t forget that I’m trying to build a business as well. I don’t intend to spend my life in Nicole’s basement, sweetheart.” </p><p>Nancy’s blush was spectacular, and any question she might have about a possible renegotiation of the deal died under my fingers. </p><p>I didn’t want to discuss it, but not like it was a bad deal. She certainly had more share than a publishing house would have given her, and there was no possibility of them actually giving her a campaign that was actually worthwhile. </p><p>“Don’t call me sweetheart,” she answered reflexively, though it might have been more effective if a moan didn’t follow it as my fingers slipped into her wetness. </p><p>“As you wish, honey,” I said, enjoying the familiar back and forth. “Now, let’s talk about the next stage of our marketing plan,” I said. </p><p>“Right now?” she asked as she glanced down, looking between her legs, where my fingers were dancing over her core, testing her intensifying wetness. </p><p>“What better time, we need to hurry up,” I answered, yet my finger slipped deeper inside, showing I had no intention of slowing down, and stopping was just impossible. </p><p>“What do you have in mind?” she asked. </p><p>“I have already found a model for the next stage, and we were going through the test session before you rudely interrupted,” I said, only for her to stiffen. </p><p>“The other room, here,” she said, a blush suddenly spreading on her face. </p><p>“Yes,” I said smugly as I caught her gaze. “Don’t tell me that you’re feeling shy.” </p><p>“Of course not,” her answer came predictably, showing that despite suffering under the same trick several times, her pride was still strong — though, it might also be about the fact that she wasn’t particularly against the ‘suffering’ she experienced as a result. </p><p>“Good,” I said as I let my fingers quicken while I leaned to kiss her neck, teasing one of her weaker spots, making her moan cutely, which was, without a doubt, loud enough to be heard from the other room. “Now, let’s talk about your tasks,” I added, but only after a minute later. </p><p>“You want me to…” she whispered, her blush intensifying while her voice disappeared. </p><p>“Such a dirty mind,” I interrupted her with a chuckle. “No, I don’t want you to come and molest her, you naughty minx,” I said. She blushed, but didn’t try to claim that she wasn’t trying to say that.</p><p>“What do you need?” she asked, but only after a minute, and three failed attempts as I continued working on her body, the amazing success she just experienced made it particularly easy to push her toward the climax this time. She was yet to arrive at that final destination, but only because I slowed down my fingers. </p><p>“You need to select a character from the book, one that’s fitting for a thin brunette with a lithe body,” I said. “And then, you’ll show your tailoring abilities to rapidly create a costume for the stuff that’s available in the room. Do you think you can handle it?” </p><p>“Well, we have a priestess that wears white,” she said as she glanced at the bedsheets.</p><p>“Excellent,” I said even as I grabbed her shoulder and pushed her down, my fingers lashing out aggressively, helping her to take the last step, then pulled back after one last kiss, leaving her trembling on the bed. </p><p>“But wouldn’t they mind about the sheets? What if they make us pay back—“ she said, only for me to press my finger to her beautiful lips once more. </p><p>“Don’t forget that we have enough money, sweetie,” I said as I stood up. “You have thirty minutes,” I said with a chuckle and walked back, curious what the others had been doing in my absence.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Maybe multitasking was the superior option, I thought after a momentary thought even as I tightened my arms around her waist, preventing a painful collapse without the support of the wall after I took a step back. </p><p>It proved to be a good choice. As I moved, her body lost all strength, and would have fallen down without my assistance keeping her up. </p><p>As I walked toward the center of the room, she started showing signs of recovery. The biggest sign was the intensity of her transformation, slowly disappearing as I moved forward. The flames stayed on her body, covering every inch of her skin, but the flames started to get calmer, more stable. From the dazed yet satisfied smile on her face, I could feel that it was a personal preference rather than something she was unable to control. </p><p>The room was still burning, but I easily ignored that even as I took a step among the flames, enjoying my new ability. </p><p>I glanced at her bed, which was, just like everything else in the room, burned intensely, but the frame looked strong enough to carry us. So, I changed my direction there even as I cast a few spells. </p><p>However, rather than extinguishing the flames, I reinforced the structure of the bed, making sure it wouldn’t collapse halfway into our little adventure. </p><p>“It’s time we have a talk,” I said as I put her on the bed, face first. </p><p>“D-do you think you can order me?” she stammered as she tried to turn and face me, uncaring of her nudity. However, while her words implied a rejection of my command, that message wasn’t exactly strong when the nature of her moan joined it. </p><p>I just needed to press my hand on the small of her back softly to abort her attempt to turn. It was all she needed as an answer to her question. </p><p>Regardless, I gave her the answer she was seeking. “Yes,” I answered, even as I touched the new addition to my magic, which made her flames flare once more. Whatever happened between us, creating a permanent connection.</p><p>A shocking connection, if her gasp was any indicator as I tapped to it. </p><p>“What do you —“ she started in surrender, only for her words to disappear in a shocking moan. The reason, was my finger, slipped into her tight hole even as I cast that convenient spell to prepare her tightness to my entrance, cleaning and lubricating at the same time. </p><p>“Did I tell you to stop?” I said as I spanked her ass with my empty hand, while a second finger joined the first to penetrate into her tightness. Her moan of protest was simply a thing of beauty. </p><p>Especially since it was followed by her explanation. </p><p>She took a deep breath before asking. “I was named Cinder, because I was unable to hold anything but a partial transformation,” she muttered, the bitterness in her tone enough to show just how bad of a problem it had been for her. </p><p>“The wings and the hair,” I said, just to confirm. </p><p>“Yes, but not anymore,” she answered, bitterness mixing with a sense of victory. </p><p>“And, I’m guessing that it caused some problems.” </p><p>“I don’t know what would have happened if it wasn’t for the retainers assigned by my mother before her disappearance, protecting me,” she said, though the casual mention suggested that the event happened a long time ago. “But even with the help I received, it was difficult to find my place.” </p><p>I couldn’t help but take her claim of having a hard life lightly, as it was certainly comparative, and every single thing I saw about her showed that she had a spoiled life, one of comfort and luxury, to the point of she lacked the sense of what was difficult. </p><p>Not that it was a big problem for me. </p><p>“And, you decided to somehow push yourself to an important mission, hoping that success would bring the renown you’re seeking.” </p><p>“Not as simple,” she answered, but her shame-filled tone suggested I was right on the money with my guess. </p><p>“Now, tell me, what exactly is this mission,” I asked, finally glad that I would receive the answer to my question. </p><p>“The dimensional turbulence is weakening, so we’re trying to retake possession of this planar fragment,” she started, only to be interrupted by a moan as I added another finger. </p><p>However, this time, I didn’t cut her words to enjoy her words, but to process the weight behind her words. Her statement, a soft, trembling sentence, was enough to make my heart freeze. </p><p>I intensified my assault to silence her for a moment, allowing me to ponder on the statement. There were three critical pieces of information in her sentence, each as dangerous as the previous one. </p><p>The first one, the mention of dimensional turbulence, suggested that not only came from actually different worlds and not just from distant lands. </p><p>The second one was her term to define our world. Planar fragment. I didn’t know the exact nature of classification she used, but the fragment was hardly something that was commonly used to define strong entities, implying that, the power balance between my world and theirs might be even worse than I had expected. </p><p>The third one, of course, the implication of retaking possession of it, meaning at least one faction — probably at least two considering the existence and actions of the elves — was determined to actually rule our world. </p><p>“How weak is this dimensional turbulence?” I asked even as I pulled my fingers out of her tightness, but it wasn’t a move to stop the treatment she was receiving. No, I pulled my fingers away to allow the main event to start. </p><p>She let out an even more beautiful moan as I pressed my shaft against her tight entrance. Yet, it was a sign of her growing obedience that it last only a second before she answered my question. “They are quite strong for now, enough to hold back the Threat,” she explained. </p><p>I bit my lips, suppressing my desire to cry in frustration even as she dropped another casual fireball that destroyed my perception. </p><p>Luckily, she provided me with an excellent way to combat that frustration. I grabbed her wings before I pushed forward recklessly, skewering her fully with my shaft. It was a reckless move, one that would have caused an actual injury to anyone that didn’t have her spectacular physical abilities, but in her, it just triggered her moan. </p><p>For a moment, I just enjoyed her spectacular tightness as I rammed repeatedly, giving myself a second to handle the realization of the fact. </p><p>Only after a minute of reckless impaling, did I ask another question. “Just how many forces that your forces or the elves could send,” I asked, determined to focus on the more immediate aspects of my problem. </p><p>Whatever this Threat was clearly important, I preferred to focus on the issues that created more immediate variables. </p><p>Such as, how many elves and phoenixes I would be dealing with. </p><p>“I don’t know exactly —“ she started, though it took a minute for her to recover from her moans enough to do so while I worked on her core, she got interrupted by a spank. </p><p>“Guess, then,” I ordered. </p><p>“The turbulence is calming down, but still, it’s strong enough to make every transfer a significant risk. A lot of magical ingredients need to be used to protect the traveler…” she quickly rattled, still interrupted often by moans as I continued to ram inside her. “Half a dozen at most, maybe?” she murmured. </p><p>“And, how about all these constructs.” </p><p>“Nonliving matter is easier to carry through the turbulence,” she answered. </p><p>Interesting, I thought even as I spanked her ass, revisiting my perception of her richness. Her statement suggested that the powers behind the two factions were limited to sending half a dozen agents each, and even if her guess was wrong, I doubted it was by a huge margin. </p><p>Yet, she had enough riches to achieve what was prohibitively expensive to a whole nation. </p><p>Of course, that fact wasn’t too surprising. I had just made a visit to the treasury of the Empire, and that trip had revealed just how empty the treasury was, showing that the extent of the land and control wasn’t enough. </p><p>Not only I was richer than the Empire by a considerable margin — as long as liquid reserves were concerned — but I could easily find a dozen noble houses that were probably richer. </p><p>Compared to that, a noble house with the ability to partially match the capability of a country was not surprising — especially if that family was managed by a reckless woman with an inferiority complex, willing to prove herself. </p><p>“How interesting,” I murmured even as I tightened my grip around her wings, giving myself a moment to process the secrets she revealed as she lost in a haze of pleasure. </p><p>Meanwhile, my hips continued to work aggressively, invading her core again and again, creating an excellent haze to prevent the questioning from into turning something boring. </p><p>Now, what should I focus on next… </p>",

I could feel my muscles twitching with the sudden influx of new power. I had no doubt that I could lift at least eighty pounds more at the bench, which would elevate me from being a decent college player to an actual draft candidate for the professional league. </p><p>Pity I couldn’t just display that level of improvement during the training measurements without making people suspicious. </p><p>Luckily, the game gave us much more leeway to tap into my limits. </p><p>Then, Coach Bill arrived next to me. There were no words of encouragement, not even a slight smile. Instead, he just pushed a small pile of papers in front of me, filled with complicated new lines. </p><p>I grabbed a pen and started studying them before he could even turn back and leave.</p><p>After all, just because I had received a few more Traits didn’t mean I was hungry for more. </p><p>During the next possession, our offense managed to stay on the field for almost six minutes, which, shockingly, ended up in a long field goal, giving us the lead. </p><p>Three points were hardly the greatest lead a team could enjoy, but it was certainly beat being behind. </p><p>Unfortunately, during the next possession, our opponent-adjusted their play aggressively.

Carter nodded toward me with a soft smile as well. </p><p>Though, I had a feeling he would have been much more unhappy with the adoration I was receiving if it didn’t give him another two tackles for loss, and another blitz that would have given him his second sack if the quarterback flinging away the ball fearfully. </p><p>I sat down once more, once more doing my best to channel the intent to the system before triggering it, more than happy with the results.  </p><p>[Agility III]</p><p>[Speed II]</p><p>[Perception II]</p><p>[Intimidation V]</p><p>All the efforts I put into the game were certainly not a waste, improving me greatly even when my guide devoured a significant portion aggressively. And even for that, I could see that it was not without its value, as for the first time, I could see visible signs of recovery, the glow around her connection getting stronger. </p><p>We continued watching the game, waiting to go to the field again, hoping that our offense could at least give another field goal. Unfortunately, our offense stepped on the field much more aggressively, throwing long, contested passes confidently, which racked a lot of yards, giving the receivers a lot of playing statistics. </p><p>They surprised me by giving a touchdown instead. Too bad it came from an interception, one that had been converted to an unfortunate pick-six, which was followed by a successful extra point attempt, putting us four points behind. </p><p>I couldn’t help but echo the grunts of our team. All of our efforts had been just ruined by their pointlessly aggressive play of our offense. </p><p>And I couldn’t even blame the quarterback for that, because the scheme itself was horrible in the first place. My gaze turned to Coach Spencer, who was shouting at the offense like the tactics he had developed had nothing to do with the spectacular failure. </p><p>The offensive players didn’t seem to mind, just nodding and gesturing casually like that was just a normal situation they were facing. </p><p>I couldn’t blame them, as they knew Coach Spencer would forget it soon after.  </p><p>The worst thing about pick-six from my perspective, was that it meant that it was the turn of our offense to play again.</p><p>Stealing precious time I needed to play. </p><p>Even worse, Coach Spencer seemed to show his ineptness as a coach once more, this time by completely reversing his strategy, and attacking repeatedly through the run game — one that wasted much more time compared to the passing game. </p><p>There were too reasons for that. One, the run game, on average, had much fewer gains compared to the passing game, averaging between three to five yards depending on the game. On the contrary, a successful pass — especially aggressive ones our team liked to play — could easily average over ten. </p><p>Two, after an unsuccessful pass, the game clock stopped, but after a tackle, the clock continued to run, no matter how meager the gain. </p><p>Our offense attacked, again and again, only to give us another three-point. And, that came at the cost of not only finishing all the remaining time in the first quarter, but half of the second quarter as well. </p><p>Wasting the great opportunities I could use to gain even more Intent. </p><p>I looked at Coach Spencer at the rest of the offensive team, unable to contain my anger. Of course, I wasn’t the only defensive player that was looking at them angrily, as every defensive player was fuming red without an exception. </p><p>Though, most of my teammates were angrier about pick-six, while my hatred was targeting their sudden change of strategy. </p><p>Before shifting to that, they were just annoyances. But, by doing their best to waste time, they were doing their best to elevate themselves to the enemy. </p><p>Luckily, not all was bad. </p><p>As I walked onto the field, I could hear the people chanting my nickname, Assassin, again and again, their focus coming with a crazed invasion of Intent. </p><p>I touched the system again, though, and the content of my benefits surprised me that time. </p><p>[Taunt V]</p><p>[Speed III]</p><p>[Concealment II]</p><p>In particular, the last one, which was completely unrelated to the others. Maybe it was just an impression due to my nickname, I realized. Assassins were famous for their ability to hide, after all, and with the number of people chanting that, clearly pushed toward it. </p><p>Yet, as we lined up against the enemies, I started shouting and gesturing to the team, far more excessively than necessary, bringing every player to a different spot aggressively, making the opposing player look at me in confusion. </p><p>If it wasn’t for my Leadership Trait helping me to time those orders perfectly, I had no doubt that my teammates would share that confusion. Yet, yet with the assistance of that trait, I was able to arrange the team without accidentally shattering them. </p><p>Yet, confusing the opposing quarterback was just a bonus. I was playing in the stands. It was the reason I delivered by adjustments with exaggerated gestures, just to make sure the fans knew that I was the leader. </p><p>Since I was getting limited playing time, I wanted to squeeze every little benefit I could. </p><p>They snapped the ball, but before the quarterback could even process our strategy, a complicated blitz started. The normal strategies required the assault of four linemen, and every extra addition meant the defenses would weaken further. </p><p>Yet, I organized an attack with seven defenders, bringing three extra attackers, weakening the integrity of the defense. </p><p>Which might have created a disaster if my Intimidation didn’t work wonders to startle the quarterback. I attacked from the center, my enhanced presence enough to steal his attention for a moment as he took a fearful step back. </p><p>And it was a precious second, one that the quarterback needed to search through his viable receivers to find an easy way to get rid of the ball. But, he was slower, which meant it gave enough time for Thad to burst through the line like a runaway truck. </p><p>He might be an entertaining friend outside the field, but on the field, Thad was a true monster, the kind that was only stopped because from the beginning of the game, he had been being defended by two players. </p><p>Yet, Blitz meant that the support suddenly had his own surprise assignment, leaving Thad alone with a left tackle. </p><p>It was unfair competition. Thad didn’t even slow down before bursting forward. </p><p>To his credit, Quarterback noticed the imminent disaster, and drifted to the right to avoid him. Too bad it made him miss Carter, who slipped around the line and was approaching from the other end. </p><p>I winced as the quarterback was squeezed between Carter and Thad, being hit simultaneously. I noticed flags flying, along with the calls of roughing the passer, which meant that the hit was not a valid one, instead it cost us fifteen yards in penalties. </p><p>Yet, seeing the fearful figure of the quarterback, struggling to stand up as he glanced toward us like as he had just seen a ghost, I wasn’t entirely unhappy. </p><p>Especially when it came with its own reward of Intent. The play might have resulted in a penalty, but that didn’t prevent the audience from being even more impressed — to the point of shouting to the top of their voices, blaming the referees for being weak. </p><p>And as an added bonus, their defense looked furious. </p><p>Furious enough to make our offense pay in pain for our aggression. </p><p>What a pity. </p>",

    "content": "<p>As I stood in the center of our defensive formation, watching carefully as the opposing team fell into a simple pistol formation, I couldn’t help but smile, excitement pumping through my veins. </p><p>Pistol formation was certainly not a simple one, and hardly one I would expect them to use the first. </p><p>It was a double-run threat, designed to allow the quarterback to decide whether he wanted to run, or wanted to hand it off to his running back, making it a dangerous weapon where the quarterback had the option to choose at the last second. </p><p>It only worked with an agile quarterback that could run as well as a running back. </p><p>Unfortunately, our opponents had one of those. </p><p>It was an interesting play to start the game. Normally, the teams started with more complicated pass plays, and left such option plays toward the latter half of the game. </p><p>A wild smirk covered my face as the realization hit. They were running that, because our defense had a new mike. They were betting on the fact that I would be too afraid of making an aggressive call during the first play and using a conservative defense. </p><p>A conservative defense that would give them at least five yards in a run game. </p><p>I listened carefully as the quarterback called a few audibles, trying to catch the pattern in them. It wouldn’t work immediately, but if I could get a good sense, it would certainly help toward the second half. </p><p>Yet, my real attention was on the receivers lined up outside the numbers, watching just how tense they were. After all, there was still a good chance the quarterback choose to target them if I decided to bring a ploy that was too aggressive. </p><p>Yet, they were not tense, so, I shouted a few numbers, ones that called a single coverage — weak backfield — betting on the run or a short pass. And, I brought the extra man it would be free to ask Carter to attack from the side to pressure the quarterback, turning the first attempt into a blitz. </p><p>An overly aggressive play that made us attack the quarterback with five players, leaving our pass defense weaker. </p><p>“Hut,” shouted the opposing quarterback, and their center snapped the ball, starting the first game of the day. </p><p>And just like that, Thad slammed against the defensive line, occupying two defensive linemen, allowing me to easily bypass the defensive line. </p><p>If it was a different formation, it would have been enough to give me a sack, but in pistol formation, the running back came forward to block me, strong enough to stop me. </p><p>Yet, that left Carter free, allowing him to charge quickly, and before the quarterback could take a step forward, Carter slammed him from the blindside, making them lose three yards, and giving us the first sack. </p><p>And, giving me a lot of Intent, more than I had ever felt before. </p><p>After all, in terms of defense, a sack was only second to interception in terms of audience entertainment — and they were certainly entertained, giving me enough Intent to easily channel it. </p><p>I reached my system. </p><p>[Intimidation IV]</p><p>The reward surprised me slightly, as the reason we were able to take that move was certainly my tactical call and daring strategy, not scaring the opponent. </p><p>Then, I paused for a moment. “Silly boy,” I murmured to myself, realizing it didn’t look like that to most viewers. After all, as much as people enjoyed the sport, they missed most of the tactical complications that went into the game, more interested in the result. </p><p>Not that I blamed them, as even most of the players missed those. </p><p>“Hell yeah,” Carter shouted in satisfaction as he run toward the rest of the team while I gathered myself, enjoying the small, yet noticeable. </p><p>“Good work,” I said to him before we went to the huddle. </p><p>“Thanks,” he said, as he was certainly happy with the result. I understand why he was thanking me, as I could have run that play for myself as easily, getting myself the sack, that glorious statistic. </p><p>“I follow my promises,” I answered, even though my action was less about principles, and more about the long-term benefits. After all, no matter what, Carter still had much more power over the team than I did. Angering him would only hurt me. </p><p>Then, we went to huddle, making some quick adjustments based on the changes. </p><p>“We’re going to run a fake blitz,” I commanded them. “We’re going to press on the right side, leave the left side empty, and pull back to defend the midline. Thad, you’re going to put the pressure on the offensive line, and Carter, pressure the number fifteen. He’s their best receiver, and I want to double him.” Carter looked at me doubtfully, no doubt surprised at the sudden change of strategy. </p><p>To his credit, he didn’t vocalize his doubts. “They assume that’s I’m an excited new mike, enthusiastic to make a sack of my own. Let’s play on that before pulling the rug under them,” I explained, but that was all I was able to say as their huddle broke as they spread into a new formation. </p><p>I truly loved the benefits of Pattern Recognition, which, combined with Tactics, allowed me to read the adjustment of the opposing quarterback easily — helped by the fact that he was one of the quarterbacks that relied on his physical abilities rather than tactical acumen, making it much easier to trick him. </p><p>We lined up against them, Thad ready to attack from the right side to create a threatening balance, while Carter stood at the left, the threat of another sack exuding off him — one that the quarterback clearly took seriously, flinching as he turned to Carter.</p><p>Then, they snapped the ball, only for the quarterback to take several steps back. Thad smashed against the offensive line, his strength enough to create a threat with the assistance of just another lineman. </p><p>Meanwhile, Carter moved forward, but rather than rushing toward the quarterback, he started following the running back who had been running to the side to create a safety blanket for the quarterback. </p><p>I spent just a second looking back, to make sure the safeties and cornerbacks were protecting the correct zones, before I started tracking their tight end, but I had deliberately stayed a step behind, not revealing my full speed. </p><p>The bait was set. </p><p>I watched as the quarterback shifted in his place panicked, his plan in ruins. He was prepared to throw the ball to his best receiver the moment they snapped the ball, confident that he would be able to beat a single coverage — which would have been the limit of what we could put on that receiver if we had actually been blitzing. </p><p>What he needed to do was simple. He just needed to roll back to his left, enjoying the security of our limited attack to take his time, hoping one of his receivers would go free. </p><p>Yet, it was a reason that, as decision-makers in the field, we studied until morning. We had studied the profile of every single player aggressively, which included their ability to make decisions on the fly. </p><p>One that was significantly weak in the opposing quarterback. Panicked, his gaze turned to the tight end that was running an out route — parallel to the lines toward the end of the field — which was the easiest ball he could throw. </p><p>If the distance between me and his tight end had been the limits of my abilities. </p><p>I chose that moment to dash forward, closing in the distance. He still threw the ball, as with his arms moving, he had no choice. But it made him throw worse, allowing me to bat the ball away with my fingertips. </p><p>Which was a pity, because if he threw it accurately, I would have intercepted it. </p><p>“Nice work,” I exclaimed as we returned to the huddle once more, glancing at our dispirited opponents, who had clearly expected a better start. </p><p>As I returned to the huddle, I could see the looks of my teammates changing already, shining with a respect that had been lacking before. </p><p>“Good work, Terry,” cheered more than one as they patted my back excitedly, their reservations evaporating after two great plays — one sack, and one almost interception. </p><p>I closed my eyes, a move that might have been mistaken for being overwhelmed by the moment, but instead, I was doing my best to channel the great flood of Intent I was receiving. </p><p>A move not without its great benefits. </p><p>[Leadership II]</p><p>[Agility II]</p><p>When we lined once more, I wasn’t surprised to see them in a tight formation while their coach signaled desperately. It was going to be a run game. I assigned Carter and Thad to the sides, to pressure the quarterback even more, while I lined up at the center, leaving it weak deliberately. </p><p>Since they were going to run, I wanted them to bait to the center. </p><p>It was not the most optimal move, as if I failed, the running back would gain around ten yards at a minimum, maybe even enough to give them the first down despite the yards they lost. </p><p>Unfortunately for the running back, his attempts to fake an escape from the right of the center before he made a sudden cut to the left were too easy to read. </p><p>Worse, I hid my body behind our linemen, and crouched a bit deliberately to avoid the running back’s attention, so that when he stepped into the center, we were unaware of my presence. </p><p>A little detail I fixed with a painful tackle from the side, sending him tumbling away. </p><p>I turned to the opposing quarterback, but I said nothing, just looking at him sharply — a sharpness that had been developed a lifetime of struggle before being sharpened by the Intimidation Traits of the System. </p><p>And the opposing quarterback stumbled back in fear. </p>",

    "content": "<p>As I managed to reach the agreed meeting location, a certain small blind alley between a butcher and a large residence, just with enough foot traffic not to make her presence entirely shocking. </p><p>However, it seemed that our little trick didn’t work, as rather than finding her in place, I found the corner empty, but with recent signs of battle. </p><p>She either got caught while waiting, showing our little subterfuge was not enough. </p><p>That, or she had been caught while she was distributing the dragon hearts, and had been followed to see where she would go. </p><p>I closed my eyes, trying to detect her location. It was hard to detect where she was with the ongoing chaos — though, considering I engineered said chaos, I didn’t have much room to complain. </p><p>But, my enhanced magical detection capabilities helped me again. I closed my eyes, and after a little pause, I managed to feel one of the closer battles had a significantly different feel. </p><p>A sorcerer, fighting against two mages. </p><p>Or more accurately, a sorceress. </p><p>The soft, malleable nature of Xia’s mana was very easy to distinguish thanks to my abilities, but even without that, I could have easily identified her. After all, I couldn’t imagine any other sorcerer or sorceress actually having trouble against two ordinary mages, no matter how tired the sorceress in question was, or how skilled were the attacking mages. </p><p>I followed the direction, the mobility of the Nemean lion allowing me to easily scale the buildings and preventing me from getting lost in the process. Which was nice, because I arrived just as the two mages were about to finish setting up a ward around her that would send her unconscious. </p><p>She did her best to defend herself, but even using the dragon heart, she was barely able to delay that. Without my intervention, she would simply fail. </p><p>Though, that didn’t mean the challenge was particularly simple for the attacking mages as well. Even in her exhausted state, Xia was not exactly a simple challenge. Enough that, they failed to register my presence even as we looked down from a roof. </p><p>“Tell us where did you find all those dragon hearts, and we’ll show mercy,” warned one of the mages, yet he didn’t shout. </p><p>His comment made me think that they were either unrelated to the little ploy, noticed Xia’s trick, or belonged to one of those target families, but decided the potential acquisition of several dragon hearts was worthy of committing treason. </p><p>Either case, their answer was all I needed to decide how to handle the process. I dug my heels to the side of my mount, and he charged down. One of the mages died under the claws of the lion before he could react, while the second one didn’t survive the movement of my spear. </p><p>“Long time no see,” I said with a chuckle even as I stood next to Xia, and presented my hand to her. </p><p>“T-that’s a Nemean lion,” she stammered as she looked at the beast. “How are you still alive.” </p><p>“Come on, this little kitten,” I said with a chuckle as I passed my hands through his mane. “He’s harmless.” </p><p>The beast tensed under me, as while he lacked the ability to directly understand words, he recognized my mocking tone and understood enough that it was directed to it. </p><p>Yet, rather than taking any action, it crouched down, inviting Xia to climb. “See,” I said with a chuckle. </p><p>Xia looked suspicious, but considering the risk we were in, she didn’t have the luxury to choose, as a catastrophic magical explosion going off just a couple of streets away reminded her. </p><p>She grabbed my hand, and I pulled her up. “Hold tight,” I warned her, before digging my heels to the side of my mount once more, and he charged forward. </p><p>With full speed, of course, we lost more than enough time.</p><p>“You’re a madman,” she cried in panic as her arms wrapped around my waist desperately as we jumped over the buildings. </p><p>“We’re in a hurry, sweetie. It’s not like we have lots of options,” I explained as we continued to charge. </p><p>“When are we going to take a turn, then,” she said as we got nearer the walls. “If we get too close to the walls, they might attack us while we charge for the gates. </p><p>“Why gates, when we have the opportunity to take a shortcut,” I said as I encouraged the lion to go even faster. </p><p>As we got nearer the walls, the sparse amount of soldiers that occupied confirmed that it was the correct choice. </p><p>Ironically, such an attempt would have been suppressed much easier in any other city under the republic, but Rome historically didn’t allow the presence of a permanent army, was afraid of political interventions, and relied on Patrician families’ own forces to defend against any incursion. </p><p>Most of the guards actually belonged to the patrician families and other civilian organizations, and currently, they were all pulled into the city, to assist their own factions. </p><p>So, we jumped over the wall with ease — though one wouldn’t believe that if they listened to Xia’s fearful cry as her grip around my body tightened further, the soldiers that were responsible for guarding the walls, busy fighting to get the treasures we spread around. </p><p>All around, an excellent plan, I thought as we left Rome, and the growing chaos, behind. </p><p>Oh, quite a few soldiers tried to follow us, accompanied by some mages, but under our circumstances, nothing less than several Sorcerers could prevent our immediate escape. </p><p>And the forces of the city couldn’t even spare one Sorcerer, let alone half a dozen. </p><p>“We’re going the wrong way,” she said after a couple minutes. “The sea is on the other side. We’re going toward the mainland.” </p><p>“I know,” I said as I encouraged the lion to move even faster. “That’s the part of the diversion,” I explained. She said nothing else, though it was not just about her acceptance of my strategy, but also her exhaustion. Suppressing the aura of all those weapons and dragon hearts, even for several minutes, clearly pushed her near her limit, and the following battle or the excitement of our escape didn’t help her any. </p><p>We stopped only when we arrived at the side of a river, one that was flowing fast toward the river. I hugged Xia and stepped down. “I can walk myself,” she protested as she looked at me. </p><p>“Well, you can. But can you swim unassisted?” I asked as I pointed at the raging river. She didn’t answer, which was enough to show her position. </p><p>I smirked before I turned to my mount, looking at him with a soft nostalgia. Our little relationship started rocky enough, but for better or worse, he was the pet I owned the longest — as living as a bastard, I never dared to adopt one, knowing it would be killed by my uncle to make me feel pain, or by my grandfather, to make me tougher. </p><p>I certainly would have loved to bring him with me, but even if I didn’t need to use him as a distraction, a long sea voyage was not something for a lion. </p><p>Certainly not for one that rivaled a small elephant in terms of size. </p><p>“Go and hide in the mountains, and try to stay visible,” I ordered, though words were rather unnecessary, as I used the signs I taught him while I trained him. </p><p>It let out a loud roar, then turned and left. </p><p>Well, at least it would be almost impossible for him to get caught in the mountains, I thought sadly.  </p><p>Soon, we were alone on the side of the river. </p><p>“Do we have to?” Xia asked as she looked at the raging water, cold enough to make her tremble even as we stood near it. “The sea is bad enough, but the river looks freezing cold…” </p><p>“That, or we stay and have a nice discussion with the Consul about how we didn’t mean to create a riot in his capital,” I explained, which was all she needed to let out a sigh. Then, I grabbed her and jumped into the water, letting the raging waters carry us to the sea…</p>",

    "content": "<p>Some decisions were difficult, requiring hours of deliberate consideration, measuring every single advantage and disadvantage to give a nuanced and careful decision. </p><p>Some were not. </p><p>Luckily for me, watching a beautiful yet exhausted princess saunter toward the nearest pillow in a room blanketed by her own mana, enough to blind her to any kind of spell, firmly belonged to the letter category. </p><p>Especially since she sat down on the same pillow that I had been occupying moments ago. And, considering the amount of time I had spent on that pillow testing the limits of her puppets’ endurance, I wasn’t willing to write it off as accidental. </p><p>She was quick to confirm that when, rather than closing her eyes to sleep, to address her exhaustion, she parted her legs and placed her fingers on her panties, doing a familiar circular movement to address the aftereffects of her little subterfuge. </p><p>Though, considering the speed her fingers worked, I realized that I might have overdone the teasing aspect of my little trick a bit — or, misread her sensitivity to the pleasure. </p><p>Or, more accurately, I had forgotten it under the heat of the moment, I realized. After all, in the previous encounter I had with Delia, when I had first discovered her subterfuge, she was not using a puppet but was there physically under a disguise, and it didn’t take much to take her down then. </p><p>And that time, she had her fake skills to help. </p><p>I slipped through the wards and walked into the room once more, relying on the excessive mana that still filled the room to make my approach even more unnoticeable as I slowly closed in the distance.</p><p>The thick blanket of mana helped me adjust my clothing, and soon, my clothes turned into a long, oppressive robe, one that was designed in the exact style the headmistress wore in her attempt to look like a dark abomination, though with three differences. </p><p>The robe is way gray rather than black. I didn’t copy her fake hunchback. And most importantly, I didn’t copy the oppressive fake aura of her that had first made me mark her as a potential undead. </p><p>No need to kill the mood. </p><p>Still, the costume was a good choice to give the best of both words. It would allow me to confront the princess — which was a viable strategy now that I had a reasonable understanding of her capabilities and limitations — but also, depending on how our discussion developed, it gave me the chance to keep my other personality intact. </p><p>There was no harm in insurance.</p><p>“I hope I’m not interrupting,” I said as I stood directly in front of her, letting the illusion slowly disappear and revealing myself. </p><p>She said nothing, just freezing as she looked at me, fear in her eyes. I realized my mistake a moment later. She had clearly mistaken me for an assassin, which was a big problem considering her position. </p><p>I fixed that misunderstanding,  but not before letting that moment stretch for a couple seconds, letting her taste the fear, not reacting immediately. Even her mana was immobile. “I’m here about the headmistress,” I said, using a different, calmer tone than my earlier speech. </p><p>A small adjustment in cadence and tone, and it was impossible for her to realize we were the same person. </p><p>“The headmistress sent you,” she said in an attempt to get herself some time. To her credit, despite the earlier scare, she managed to deliver those words with an impressive calm tone. If closed my eyes, I wouldn’t have guessed they came from a half-naked princess that just went through an assassination scare. </p><p>I had to admit, she had strong nerves, enough to push the fear back easily. That would have made me more annoyed if I was planning to rely on fear to unbalance her. </p><p>Luckily, she had already given me a much better tool to tease and manipulate her. “No, that implies I’m her junior,” I said even as I waved my hand and magically dragged a chair, enjoying the way she tensed even more. Not because of the spell itself, as it was simple enough for someone with just a novice Arcana capabilities to achieve, especially not under her wards. “I’m just here to talk about her.” </p><p>But doing so without leaking even the slightest bit of mana was more impressive, reinforcing the intimidating aura of my current disguise. </p><p>Not all threats need to be delivered directly. </p><p>As she tried to stand up, I gestured for her to stop, moving away from the intimidation to other aspects. “Please, don’t stop in my account. Interrupting you is rude enough.” </p><p>“N-not a problem,” she stammered, her earlier confidence suddenly staggering as I turned my attention to her carnal nature as she repositioned herself, closing her legs to hide the most revealing aspect of her clothing, but noticing my teasing smile, she stopped her attempts to fix her clothing, thinking that I wanted to leverage her dressing process to weaken her position. </p><p>She managed to suppress the outward signs of her shame quickly as she adjusted her stance, straightening her back even though doing so enhanced her cleavage even more. </p><p>This time, I let a momentary frown appear on my face, which earned a small display of satisfaction from her as she maintained her revealing stance. </p><p>A frown that was the exact opposite of what I was feeling. In certain situations, I loved dealing with experts. Their instinctual expertise made it even easier to manipulate them. I just need to give the slightest implication of my strategy, and she already ‘countered’ it perfectly. </p><p>A response that not only locked her to a weaker and uncomfortable position, but also gave me an amazing view. And, to make things even better, I saw that realization in her gaze a moment later, realizing the absurdity of her reaction, driven by a combination of her political reflexes and her lingering arousal. </p><p>“How can I help an exalted guest, strong enough to refer her as his junior,” she said even as she took a stock of the way I dressed. A light of recognition appeared on her gaze, showing that she didn’t miss the stylistic choices I made on my robe. </p><p>Yet, she was still careful enough not to utter anything about that. After all, my appearance was sufficiently mysterious, and if her information about the headmistress was as limited as I assumed, it was not out of question for the headmistress to be a part of a group, at least not to a point of calling me out. </p><p>Her subtle yet growing tenseness confirmed that guess. </p><p>How interesting, I thought even as I rapidly adjusted my plan, which took only a couple of seconds, a time that worked wonders to increase her stress.</p><p>“So,” I murmured slowly. “You’re the little annoyance that was giving all that trouble to my coworker, what a naughty girl.” I did my best to push a careless attitude as I turned my gaze on her cleavage, acting like revealing my identity was an act of distraction that could only come from supreme confidence, ‘revealing’ an important clue about my identity. </p><p>“Giving trouble to your coworker?” she asked with a trembling voice. “Sorry if it sounds disrespectful, but I don’t remember doing anything.” </p><p>“Oh, you’re saying that breaking into her office, or trying to suborn her employees for dangerous missions with extreme political consequences that would pit her against a mysterious organization that dismantled your power base completely is an accident.” </p><p>I loved the way she tensed despite her best efforts. She was good, but not good enough to completely hide the emotional weight of revealing two of her most important undercover activities at the same time, a combination that was enough to turn her into an enemy of Silver Spires — not exactly a welcome outcome in her current situation. </p><p>Our current level difference just enhanced the hopelessness of her situation. </p><p>And, the beauty of those words was the impact was not limited to it. I also confirmed that I was at the same level as the headmistress while also implying that both of us were a part of the bigger, more mysterious organization. </p><p>I wasn’t shocked by her willingness to believe that fact, considering her own powerbase was dismantled completely by a similarly mysterious organization. </p><p>Yet, as I waited, I could feel her shock getting more intense than I was expecting, though only when I noticed signs of fear, did I realize the nature of her misunderstanding. </p><p>I was tempted to let her simmer with that misunderstanding, but seeing her fear despite her resistance to it, it was clear that pushing her in that direction had the risk of shattering her completely. </p><p>And I certainly didn’t want to break my first royal ‘friend’. She had so much potential for fun. </p><p>I still waited a second before dispelling her growing fear. “No need to fear, I’m not from that organization that ruined your little sibling rivalry,” I said, not missing the opportunity to trivialize her political challenges. </p><p>Ironically, unlike most other things I managed to lie in quick succession, it was actually the truth. If the information I managed to collect about the Imperial family was even half-accurate, barring an intervention of the Eternals, it would take me less than a week to put her on her throne, considering her brothers had to ask for outside assistance despite the restrictions of her power. </p><p>The potential intervention of the Eternals, naturally, complicated any precision significantly. Clearly, I wouldn’t have a hope of resisting the full might of the organization, but the same didn’t apply if it was only an undercover operation. </p><p>And, considering their strategies against Janelor, I was willing to believe that the latter was the likelier option. </p><p>However, as I watched the princess shuffle in discomfort, trying to process my daring reveals, I decided to focus on the present. </p><p>We still had a lot to talk about. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 630000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 7334 / 7334 Mana: 9000 / 9000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Grandmaster Tantric [114/140]</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [85/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Titania - Level 35/38]</p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Marianne - Level 21/29]</p>",

    "content": "<p>I didn’t leave them alone for long, of course. The moment I was out of the guards of the royal residence, I cast a spell to erase my presence and returned. </p><p>The only reason I went through that in the first place was the number of maids walking in the corridors, and I didn’t want them panicking about my sudden disappearance. </p><p>And, as I walked around the building and reached one of the less-defended spots — which was made easy thanks to several days of recon— I wondered whether it was appropriate to call them they. After all, there were not three people, but just the princess, and two of her puppets. </p><p>Two very realistic puppets. </p><p>It was a trivial problem, but not an easy one. </p><p>In comparison sneaking back into the residence of the princess was both trivial and easy. </p><p>The fake orgy — it was entertaining, certainly, but that didn’t change its weird fake nature — I had just gone through had been beneficial in many different aspects. </p><p>It breached another layer of the mystery around the princess, one that significantly reduced the intimidation that came from the shadow of unknown abilities. </p><p>It also helped me to level up, which was always a welcome side benefit. </p><p>Yet, the benefits of the extended orgy weren’t that limited. During the encounter, I had used a lot of mana, and while most of it was focused on indirectly observing the princess — who was on the edge of total collapse due to exhaustion and indirect arousal — quite a bit of it was directed to the wards around the room, leveraging her distraction. </p><p>Using the benefit of that interference, I managed to pass through the wards with trivial ease after I moved through the corridors and arrived at the destination, a combination of my agility and an illusion spell enough to keep me protected, now that I was confident that I wouldn’t come across a random bystander over level thirty. </p><p>I still made sure to check the maids and soldiers I came across as I walked, just to confirm that. They were just ordinary people, none of them a threat. </p><p>I couldn’t help but chuckle at the thought as the realization hit. Even the weakest maid was higher than level five, and the average guard was well above ten, creating an intimidating group that could be extremely threatening. </p><p>There was a time, not too long ago, even one level ten warrior created an unsurmountable barrier for me. </p><p>I was entertained by the sudden realization and the changes in my own perspective, but not enough to stop my quick steps, until I arrived at my destination.  </p><p>Just in time, as I managed to catch the princess in the middle of the room, in front of the half-dissolved conjurations of Delia and the warrior puppets, slowly unraveling them and storing the mana into a large metal vase studded with an incredible number of gems. </p><p>I only glanced at the metal vase, as it was not only a storage item, but also inferior to anything I could create in less than an hour. It could store mana, but not very well, and not for long. </p><p>I needed to focus on the mana flow, but my attention was stolen by the way she dressed. She was just wearing a half-loosened corset and panties, both drenched with sweat and arousal, showing that resisting my indirect touches — especially after I had elevated the reaction through her connection. </p><p>After working with her magical puppets that were created in her own image, her half-naked body was mostly familiar, but that didn’t make examining her body any less fun. After all, no matter how beautiful, there was a difference between a magical puppet and reality. </p><p>Not to mention, seeing her hot and bothered after the show was much better — especially since she was still clearly at the edge, busy handling the puppets to address the challenge she faced. </p><p>As much as I would have preferred to watch the rise and fall of her beautiful bosom, I had magical issues I needed to focus on. First, I fed a minuscule amount of Divine Spark to the system, and received a little helpful notification back. </p><p>[Level Difference of five or more! No Experience]</p><p>At the moment, she was weak enough not to provide me with any experience, showing that her level was low. Of course, under my circumstances, low could mean anything less than thirty, but still, it allowed me to take the next step without much concern. </p><p>[-58 Mana]</p><p>I carefully extended my mana to the distance. Normally, it would have been a risky behavior, but luckily, regardless of her level, the princess was busy trying to reabsorb the mana that she used to construct her puppets back into the container. The task not only occupied her attention significantly, but also filled the background with mana, giving enough concealment to keep my string hidden. </p><p>As I got closer to the flickers of magic, I couldn’t help but feel familiar with the nature of the mana that she was letting out. It was familiar to another type of mana, but since it was heavily modified, it was different enough to prevent me from pinning it. </p><p>It slipped into her body without an issue, then reached her Soul Space… </p><p>Only to make me freeze in shock as I took a note of her level. </p><p>She was below level ten. </p><p>What an interesting little detail, I thought, though I couldn’t help but admire her, as achieving what she was able to achieve without significant assistance from the system was impressive, even if she had the resources of the royal family to assist her. </p><p>Yet, the enormity of her achievement soon lost its significance as I noticed something else, something more important. </p><p>Divine Spark was flowing freely in her Soul Space. </p><p>I couldn’t help but focus on the way she was storing and using Divine spark. First, I focused on the storage aspect. I had dealt with Divine Spark in several forms, but every time, the only way to achieve that was to lock it behind strong storage. Both the Companion Node my system created and the Light node the headmistress created worked on that principle. </p><p>Even the way the headmistress kept the excessive amount of Divine Spark she was barely able to contain in her own body, using the nature of her body to keep it contained despite the costs. </p><p>I never even thought letting the Divine Spark flow freely in Soul Space was possible without the system devouring it. </p><p>I had to apply a considerable number of tricks to prevent the system from devouring it, even after locking it. And the headmistress managed that while using it because she not only didn’t have a system, but also lived under oppressive wards that were fueled with oppressive Darkness wards. </p><p>Then, it clicked, as I managed to remember why I found the Divine Spark in her core familiar. It was the Darkness Spark. It just took a while for me to match that, because I didn’t directly interact with the ward. </p><p>And just like that, a few things worked wonders. Considering the way both the headmistress and the princess were using, it was clear that Darkness Spark had the ability to trick the system — as evidenced by the puppets that could trick the system or wards that could block its detection capabilities without actually restricting the abilities coming from it. </p><p>It also explained why the princess had risked so much to breach the headmistress’ office despite desperately relying on her goodwill for protection. It was about the Darkness Spark, although whether she just wanted to confirm its presence or wanted to steal it was still not certain. </p><p>There was even a possibility that she actually wanted to take down the ward to kill the headmistress, which would have worked perfectly considering the trouble she was having to contain her Light Spark, but that was not a likely case. </p><p>Viability aside, it required a very intimate knowledge of the headmistress’ exact circumstances, and even for me, it took quite a bit to collect that information. </p><p>So, I was willing to write that part off as a coincidence, especially since she had made no follow-up in that direction. </p><p>I focused on the next part of my indirect examination. </p><p>The way the princess’ soul space was interacting with the Divine Spark was interesting enough to get my full attention despite the amazing view in front of me as the princess continued to unravel her puppets — proving just how much of complicated it was. </p><p>The first great difference was easy to identify. The Darkness Spark was floating in her Soul Space freely rather than gathered into a tight clump. It was not something I could replicate that, at least not without the system absorbing it aggressively. </p><p>She was able to do that, because, for some reason, the System was unable to detect the Darkness Spark properly. Probably about the conceptual nature of the Divine Spark. Just like the Light Spark working wonders as a destructive weapon, the Darkness Spark worked amazingly to hide. </p><p>And to create puppets, I mentally added as I continued to examine her Soul Space while she was busy unraveling her puppets, her mana interacting with the freely flowing Divine Spark in a very unique way, imbued with a unique nature. </p><p>While the process of doing so was more complicated than the Light Node helping the transformation of mana, it was also much more flexible. Compared to the flexibility she was showing, the nodes were much simpler. </p><p>Even with the potential advantages the Darkness Spark provided, I doubted that one could simply create fake soul spaces and magical puppets realistic enough to trick the System. </p><p>Of course, that flexibility was not without a cost, as the way she was using the Spark was significantly more complicated, which came with the cost of exhaustion. </p><p>So, as she finished unraveling the last string of mana from the puppets, her efficiency of storing the mana fell lower and lower, blanketing the room with mana — mana that felt the touch of her Darkness Spark twice, blanketing the room with enough energy to provide me with the perfect cover. </p><p>All I needed to do was to decide what I would do next…</p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 630000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 7334 / 7334 Mana: 9000 / 9000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Grandmaster Tantric [114/140]</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [85/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Titania - Level 35/38]</p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Marianne - Level 21/29]</p>",

    "content": "<p>It was finally Monday, lunch break, and after a long morning filled with classes, I finally picked my tray — though the cafeteria food barely had enough calories to qualify as a snack. </p><p>I was certainly glad that I had sneaked a couple of protein bars in my bag. </p><p>Though, as I moved, I couldn’t help but be amused by the lack of attention from the crowd. It wasn’t the first time, but still, the sensation of being ignored was … different. As the quarterback in my last school, every step of me was watched — sometimes with admiration, but mostly with impotent envy, hoping for a mistake. </p><p>I might as well be invisible in my new school as I walked toward the corner table, where the nerdy group of girls that I had found myself mixed with — in more ways than one — was sitting. </p><p>Yet, as I got closer, I could feel that a mood different than their usual cheer ruled the table. </p><p>The simplest difference came from Carrie’s attitude. After the memorable weekend we shared, there had been considerable changes in her mood. The last time, she was excessively shy, afraid that one of her friends would realize just how far we had gone. </p><p>Naturally, after everything she had managed to accomplish during the weekend, she had no such fear of getting revealed.</p><p>And, speaking of achievements, in terms of confidence, Sarah’s expression took a great step back. Even in the short distance I needed to cover, I had caught her sending hesitant glances to Carrie, her gaze a mixture of guilt and confusion, though whenever her gaze caught Naomi’s sharp expression, it mostly recovered, gaining a smug undertone. </p><p>Naomi was angry, and if her gaze had been pointing at me, I might have felt bad, thinking that I had pushed her to something she wasn’t prepared for. Yet, considering her angry gaze was firmly on Sarah, tightening further whenever Sarah’s smirk made another appearance, it was clear that it was the fact that she had ‘lost’ in their little competition more than anything else. </p><p>Irene, unlike others, had no change in her usual cheerful expression except a slight confusion considering the changed mood of the table, trying to understand what was different. </p><p>Yet, despite the great spread, I found Ida’s the most interesting. It wasn’t her blush, which was almost a constant fixture on her face, but the way her gaze was bouncing between me, Naomi, and Sarah, her beautiful dark eyes deliciously wide. </p><p>If I were to guess, someone had spilled the beans to her about our Saturday adventure. </p><p>“Hi, girls,” I said cheerfully, doing my best to maintain my casualness as I plopped between Ida and Carrie, which made Naomi look at Ida with a momentary panic. “So, how was the weekend?” </p><p>Allowing me to guess who spilled the beans. </p><p>Carrie was first to answer. “Excellent,” she said. “The game night was so much fun, wasn’t it Sarah?” </p><p>Sarah’s expression of guilt was thick, luckily for her, the rest of the table turned their gaze on Carrie, shocked by her attitude. “What game night?” Irene asked. “And why wasn’t we invited?” </p><p>The suggestion of invitation triggered shy reactions of Naomi and Ida as their gazes met, but, considering they hadn’t turned that to Carrie, they were yet to guess anything about the Friday adventures. They were just thinking about a similar adventure the next night. </p><p>Carrie started to explain as she looked at Irene, though, at this point, I was familiar enough with the curl around her lips to understand her objective. “Well, well, we were supposed to have a study session, but Sarah decided to join us at the last second, so we played some board games. Nothing too interesting.” </p><p>“Yeah, nothing too interesting,” Sarah echoed as she looked down, doing her best to hide her face, therefore missing Carrie’s satisfied gaze. </p><p>“Ignore Sarah, she’s in a bad mood because I won,” Carrie said. Well, technically, I was the winner, both in the board game and in general, but I let Carrie have her little victory. </p><p>After all, from a certain perspective, it was certainly a shared achievement. </p><p>“Hey, it’s not good being ignored just because you have a hunky new friend,” Irene said, shaking her finger toward me in mock disapproval. “I feel neglected. Just don’t tell me that you guys had other events.” </p><p>“We didn’t,” Carrie said, then turned her gaze to Naomi. “If you discount a small shopping trip to pick Naomi some new exercise clothes while Chad gave his ideas, of course.”</p><p>This time, Irene’s disappointment was not so mocking. “Hey, maybe I’m really getting neglected,” she said, her frown getting deeper. “Also, why did you guys invite Chad to the shopping trip? It’s not exactly the favorite activity of men.” </p><p>“Because he exercises even more than Naomi, so he knows a lot about exercise clothes,” Carrie answered. </p><p>“Really, more than Naomi?” Irene asked, surprised. Her surprise was understandable considering I was wearing a loose flannel shirt that made me look slightly pudgy. </p><p>“Sure, if you don’t believe it, why don’t you give a squeeze to his biceps,” Carrie said. Naomi looked at Carrie in surprise, but Sarah didn’t share it as she had seen Carrie being much more adventurous when it came to showing off her ‘boyfriend’. </p><p>“Hey, I feel objectified,” I said, but that didn’t prevent me from leaning forward to present my arm to Irene, curling it hard to maximize the bulge of my biceps. </p><p>It would be a lie to say I didn’t enjoy the way Irene’s eyes widened as her hand tried to wrap around, only to fail. “You got to be kidding me,” Irene murmured as her hands started dancing up toward my shoulders. “Are you wearing fake muscles?” </p><p>“Do you want me to remove my shirt in the middle of the cafeteria, so you can be sure?” I suggested, which made her blush. </p><p>And she wasn’t the only one who blushed. </p><p>“N-no, of course not, I was just joking,” she stammered. </p><p>“Good, maybe I should change seats with Ida?” I said. </p><p>“W-what? Why?” Irene asked. </p><p>“Because you don’t seem to intent on stopping your grabbing,” I said, which made her jerk away panicked, realizing just how long she had been grabbing my arm. </p><p>“S-sorry,” she stammered as I took my seat. </p><p>“Don’t worry honey, being molested by a beautiful girl is hardly a chore,” I answered, my word choice hardly helping her to keep her mood down. </p><p>“Maybe you should ask him to help with your cosplay, weren’t you talking about how you didn’t have anyone to accompany you as the barbarian king, what’s his name?” </p><p>“Not a barbarian king, he’s Grutnar, the great warrior Savior of the Steppes. He’s offered kingship but he rejects it because…” Irene answers rapidly, only to stop herself halfway as her gaze turned to me, blushing. “The accuracy is important,” she added in a soft voice.</p><p>While Irene was busy blushing, Naomi leaned down and whispered a question to Carrie. A question that I was able to hear thanks to our closeness. “What are you doing?” she whispered.</p><p>“Well, since you didn’t want to get the benefits, maybe someone else should have a try,” Carrie answered, which, considering Naomi’s sudden frustration, implied that Naomi didn’t tell Carrie just how far she had gone that night, nor the assistance she had received in the process. </p><p>Meaning, that Carrie knew what Naomi had done, yet Naomi didn’t know that Carrie knew. </p><p>And, Carrie was developing to a point that was just merciless enough to leverage that information asymmetry to her own objectives. </p><p>Her current objective, somehow trying to add her redheaded friend into our weird relationship… </p><p>I didn’t intervene because… Well, I didn’t really have a reason to do so, not when I was the one enjoying the benefits. And considering I actually lost a bet to Carrie — after her surprisingly insidious trick about prime numbers — and as a forfeit, I had to seduce the last two members of their little group of friends, I wasn’t in a position to reject her help.  </p><p> “Well, I wouldn’t mind helping you. I’m free this evening, how about you?”</p><p>And just like that, the table broke into another burst of shocked gazes. Irene blushed, unable to react to the rapid development, her gaze bouncing between me and Carrie. Naomi was not too different, though hers were bouncing between Carrie and Ida. Ida was just looking at Naomi, her eyes wide as she no doubt thought about the story she had listened from her best friend. </p><p>Yet, the most interesting one belonged to Sarah. Her gaze was firmly on Carrie, a suspicious glare added to her shock. As the only person who was aware of the full extent of Carrie’s meddling, she was starting to realize that it might not be as accidental as she might have first thought. </p><p>Luckily, considering her actions with both Naomi and Carrie, she didn’t exactly have a pristine mind herself, enough to make her keep her mouth shut and turn her into an observer. </p><p>“Sounds good,” Irene answered, which was the end of it. </p><p>Or, what was supposed to be the end of it, before Ida interrupted with her soft, cute voice. “M-maybe I could come as well, I have a few costumes from games… And I can bring my camera.” </p><p>Irene looked less than enthusiastic about that idea, which was good news about where her mind drifted immediately, but I wasn’t going to miss the amazing opportunity. “Sure, the more, the merrier,” I answered with my best seductive smile, enjoying their gazes dipping down, their imagination wild… </p><p>Amusingly, only Irene thought that I was being hypothetical… </p>",

    "content": "<p>I resisted the call of a climax while Cinder was busy handling her latest one, using the precious few seconds I earned to think freely while.</p><p>It was the best way to use the opportunity created by the invasion of pleasure. </p><p>The first target of my attention was, naturally, the nature of the chaotic transformation my magic was going through at the moment, triggered by her even more intense one. </p><p>A process as mysterious as it was intense.  </p><p>I closed my eyes, turning my attention to the way my magic continued to flow chaotically inside me, trying to make a sense of the chaos cycling inside me. </p><p>The control I could exert over my magic was still funky, but luckily, observing my internal flow didn’t take too much control, giving me enough accuracy to come to a conclusive decision about the harm of the process. </p><p>Even luckier, it actually confirmed my earlier assumption about the process not being harmful. </p><p>On the contrary, I could feel my magical reserves getting warm, while the potency of my magic increased along. </p><p>The change itself was not monumental, less than a percent if measured. </p><p>But, considering I had long pushed it to human limits — at least without risking constant madness and a plethora of other unpleasant side effects — through to a unique and carefully experimented combination of rituals, training, and magical remedies, the fact that my reserves had any potential to improve was surprising. </p><p>Enough to be classified as miraculous. </p><p>Just to make things even better, I could feel that it was just a start. My reserves continued to get warmer and warmer. </p><p>“Let’s move things to the next stage,” I said as I stood up, my hand on her hips to prevent her from standing up, not wanting to take the risk of sliding out. I had no idea whether pulling out would stop the process or cause harm, but I certainly didn’t want to take the risk while it was actually achieving the impossible. </p><p>Cinder seemed to understand what had been going on, so expecting a warning from her if that had been the level of danger I would have faced was reasonable. </p><p>Or more accurately, it would have been reasonable if she was able to do anything but utter the word impossible again and again while continuing to tremble ceaselessly under the effects of her latest climax.</p><p>I decided to play it safe, and walked while keeping her firmly on my lap. </p><p>Since I was yet to cum, I was rock hard, each step pushed my shaft deeper into her, extending the duration of her beautiful rambling even more. Her attitude changed when she felt the firm presence of the wall behind her, her body pinned. </p><p>“I hope you’re ready for the next part,” I said, warning her for a fleeting moment before I burst into action, my hips rocking mercilessly. </p><p>She said no word of protest as I danced inside her, just moaned without the slightest pause. Meanwhile, as our position was firm enough to ensure there would be no undue disaster, I left my hands free to explore her flawless body once more. </p><p>That didn’t elicit any response from her either, giving me free rein over her beautiful body. Yet, it was not a move I did for pleasure. </p><p>Well, to be perfectly honest, not just for pleasure. </p><p>I used my touch to spread my mana all along her body, using my recovering control to cast several spells including but not limited to tantric, arcane, and healing, trying to get a more accurate understanding of what was going on. </p><p>Yet, as I started receiving the results of my spells, a frown appeared on my face.</p><p>Making me frown was a significant achievement, considering the extent of pleasure I was receiving from the way she tightened around me. </p><p>I frowned, because what I was receiving from my spells was conflicting, almost to the point of treating as paradoxical. Some of the spells I cast showed her magic was finally getting free after years of oppression —  for lack of a better word — while other spells gave the impression that her magic was coiling around itself, as if it was getting locked up. </p><p>Yet, regardless of the other results, each spell gave one important result. </p><p>Her magic was getting stronger. </p><p>And it was not just a potential, but the intensity of flow, gaining a fiery passion that it lacked earlier. </p><p>It didn’t take long for me to realize that fiery nature transformation wasn’t limited to her magic. With her strength booming, certain parts of her body started to catch fire — which was not as scary as it sounded, considering her hair and wings were already on fire. </p><p>From a carnal perspective, I was certainly not complaining, because the flames didn’t change the figure underneath. They only added a certain exotic layer to her beauty, one that I enjoyed immensely. </p><p>My hips worked with the steadiness of a machine as I pushed deeper and deeper inside her, while my mind worked even harder as I tried to make sense of what I had been feeling. </p><p>As I pushed more, the process of her magic got even quicker, leaving any question I had about whether what was happening was intrinsically linked to the way our bodies linked together, or it was just a coincidence. </p><p>No, it was reacting to the way our bodies rubbed against each other as I explored her depths. </p><p>Yet, it was not a sexual spell, nor some kind of trap or ritual linked to her virginity. That was certain as well. Because if that had been the case, my tantric diagnostic spells would have given much more interesting results. </p><p>My best guess, it was a weird combination of the mental impact of our shared moment, as well as the positioning of our bodies. </p><p>I turned my analysis inward, examining the more obvious nature of those changes, particularly the way it was interacting with my reserves. </p><p>Unlike the conflicting results I had been receiving from the way her mana was transforming, the situation of my reserves was rather more straightforward, with only two changes. The steady growth of my reserves… </p><p>And a spark of flame energy, slowly growing in the center of my reserves, driving that transformation. I touched that with my mana, only for the flames cover the upper half of Cinders’ body, showing it was intensely connected to her. </p><p>This time, the flare was actually accompanied by a wave of heat, enough to actually darken the stone walls she was currently pressing against — which was a significant achievement considering the magical enchantments that were woven into the stones to protect them from this exact situation.</p><p>A reasonable precaution for a phoenix.  </p><p>Yet, the way the stone darkened — and some of the nearer furniture smoking — was the only reason I knew her transformation brought such an impact. Because, even as our bodies pressed together, her flames constantly licking my body, I couldn’t feel any heat. </p><p>Curious, I turned my attention to the silver chain on her neck, expecting it to melt despite its magical resistance — it was certainly much more magical than her walls, but its delicate nature also left it weaker for such a phenomenon — only to find it still strong despite the heat it was absorbing. </p><p>No, I thought after a few seconds. It wasn’t just as strong, but it was actually getting stronger as the heat flew through its shiny surface. As I watched, I could see its pristine silver surface starting to get broken by the red lines appearing in a chaotic pattern, reminding me of the flames on her wings. </p><p>Her response to the process was rather simpler. “Impossible,” she muttered again and again, though, with each repeat, I could feel the pure shock she felt initially slowly getting diluted by each aggressive pump she received. </p><p>Though, the intensity of joy I started to feel as she was able to process the situation was an indicator that what was happening was a good development for her. </p><p>“You don’t want me to stop, do you?” I asked as I pressed my body even tighter against hers, pinning her against the wall despite her wings slowly melting the stone. </p><p>The question finally managed to break her constant string of mutterings. “No, don’t stop!” she shouted loudly, the urgency in her tone unmistakable as I slammed inside her again and again, and clearly not just about the great pleasure that was building inside her. </p><p>No, the desperate need in her tone was much higher, the kind I had only seen when I destroyed the plans of my enemies that took decades to set up, or helped my allies to achieve their life goals. </p><p>Whatever was happening to Cinder, it was not a small matter, or an unknown issue, but something that plagued her for a long while. </p><p>And, even if, by any chance, I might mistake the nature of her voice, the way her legs wrapped around my waist, making an escape impossible, given the message with perfect clarity. </p><p>I continued ramming inside her even as I examined the way the flames danced along her skin, not just limited to her torso but also spreading down to her legs. </p><p>Interestingly, at no point, did the flames cover all of her body. Instead, it covered roughly half of her body at any point, just dancing along. </p><p>As we continued, the heat wave got more and more intense. Some of the furniture actually lost its protective magic and caught fire, but interestingly, I didn’t feel the heat from them as well. </p><p>It seemed that my newly acquired fire resistance was more complete than I first thought. </p><p>But, the exact nature of that could be analyzed further. I cast a spell — as I had finally recovered the control of my magic — but rather than extinguishing the flames, I just caused a simple one to prevent any annoying smoke and other side effects. </p><p>Fucking a sexy phoenix in an endless fire was simply too tempting. </p><p>She had no complaints about the fire even though it destroyed her priceless furniture, even the simplest piece worthy of being sold in an auction in the capital, too far caught in her world to care. </p><p>Though, considering the number of magical constructs she had brought along with her for an expedition, maybe they were not as priceless from her perspective. After all, wealth and power meant different things for different people. </p><p>Or phoenixes, for that matter. </p><p>But that was just a little mental trip as I continued to pump into her while her legs stayed tight around me, each moment pushing her pleasure toward that fateful high mountain. </p><p>“Are you ready to take my load?” I whispered into her ear, both the question and my tone leaving no doubt about the nature of my interrogation. She had no choice about the situation. </p><p>Yet, her answer still managed to surprise me. “Yes,” she moaned, her legs getting as tight as the chains that still restricted her beautiful body. Interestingly, even before I cum, I noticed another change in the flames that covered her body. </p><p>The area they covered finally started growing once more, a process that got only faster when my shaft finally twitched, exploding inside her, growing more and more as my shaft twitched. When another twitch finally delivered the last drop, the flames finally covered her body completely, turning her look into a spectacular beauty. </p><p>It was finally time to question her, I thought even as she put her head on my shoulder gently, trying to catch her breath… </p><p>Or was it?</p>",

    "content": "<p>I grabbed the mane of the lion tighter with my left hand, the other firmly wrapped around the heft of my spear, ready to counter any attacker. </p><p>Not that I expected that to be the immediate response. </p><p>The image of a man riding a Nemean lion, carrying a bloodied spear, was a scary and impressive sight under any circumstances, the kind that made the guards on the walls of the Dacian School think that it was for the best to leave the glorious experience of volunteering to their friends. </p><p>Especially the danger came from behind them, where it was supposed to be a safe location. </p><p>Of course, I recognized a couple commanders that didn’t share the same idea, but with the speed of the lion, I was long gone before they could give the necessary orders. </p><p>With a great jump, the lion jumped over the great walls of the school, and started running through the streets of Rome. The onlookers were split between gaping in shock and retreating fearfully.</p><p>It was a good reaction, considering the storm that was about to envelop the city. The seeds of chaos I seeded across the place were slowly germinating while I was busy rearranging the management structure of Dacian School.</p><p>The more of my little gift packages were discovered, the stronger those seeds would take root. </p><p>It was yet to burst into open conflict, so the civilians were unaware of it. If they had been, they would have emptied the streets rather than gaping at the sight of the running lion. </p><p>Interestingly, my expectation of the upcoming disaster was not just intellectual acknowledgment of my own actions. Maybe it was another side effect of my transformation, or maybe it was just about the spectacular nature of the disaster that was about to occur, but the growing sense of tribulation was suffocating as it pressed against my senses. </p><p>As I cut a direct line toward the outer walls, more concrete evidence of the upcoming events started to appear. </p><p>The weight of gathering mana was intense enough to reveal the involvement of at least several sorcerers. That many Roman sorcerers would make even the strongest rival nation tremble in fear. </p><p>Yet, rather than fighting at the borders, they were ready to confront each other. </p><p>Greed was a dangerous poison. </p><p>They were yet to act, because facing a sorcerer was not a simple affair, especially when they were supported by wards. Even from the distance, I could feel the tenseness of their mana, waiting for the slightest excuse to act. </p><p>And, a warrior riding a Nemean Lion while carrying a Patrician weapon — visibly, as I had two others, but the bow and the sword were under a blanket to avoid too much of a commotion — was the excuse they needed. </p><p>“Stop,” exploded a voice like thunder, along with the intimidating feeling of magic. I glanced to the distance, only to see two sorcerers standing side to side, ready to act together, surrounded by a dozen mages, and a few dozen guards, their weapons were already drawn. </p><p>It was a formation that would make an actual army stagger and reassess their idea. </p><p>With my magic impaired, I doubted that I would be the victor of a direct confrontation. My magical potential might have been multiplied several times, but once again, it came at the expense of my casting ability. </p><p>Technically, the Nemean Lion and the Spear of Scipio gave me a fighting chance, especially if I let the transformation — already throbbing excitedly under my skin — go back to the surface and enhance my magical resistance, but it would only make me bog down. </p><p>I could take down two sorcerers and their retinue, but not quickly. And while I was strong, I certainly wasn’t strong enough to challenge all the Sorcerers that could be summoned in Rome. </p><p>Luckily, that wasn’t my plan in the first place. </p><p>I had already put all the fuel I needed to create the commotion. Now, all that was needed was a spark to set them on fire. </p><p>And my sudden charge was that spark. </p><p>The sorcerers in front of me were already casting their spells before I decided on a path to action. </p><p>I paused for a second to read the nature of their spells. Such an action was the first step in any magical combat that wasn’t an ambush, mostly because defending was easier than attacking, especially if the defender identified the nature of the spell accurately. </p><p>It forced Sorcerers to fight in long, carefully measured battles, relying on defensive wards and strategic moves rather than hoping to overwhelm their opponent under the aggressive waves of their own spells. </p><p>Of course, my only battle against a sorcerer happened the exact opposite, but that was only due to the ambient magic that blanketed that battlefield, enough to suffocate his attempts to actually diagnose my spells, allowing me to win an impossible battle through a reckless choice. </p><p>I had enough magic to replicate that trick in a closed and warded space, but unfortunately, one of the biggest cities in the world was hardly an area that I could casually blanket with magic.  </p><p>Luckily, even without that, I had other advantages to help me. </p><p>The first one, they had no idea that they were facing a mage — let alone another sorcerer. I didn’t exactly blame them for it, as I hardly looked like a caster while riding a magical lion and brandishing a spear.</p><p>The second one, my enhanced magical sensitivity allowed me to read their spells with an accuracy that was impossible to be replicated by them. Thanks to that, not only did I know exactly what they were casting, but also I could identify their target with shocking accuracy. </p><p>And, their spell choice made my job much easier. They were using a wide-are pure magical ward, targeting an area several feet behind me, which meant that they were prioritizing preventing my escape rather than trying to take me down — or worse, trying to kill my mount.</p><p>By committing to casting that ward together to prevent the escape of the lion, they made a huge blunder, one that I had no problems abusing. </p><p>I tightened my legs around my mouth and ordered him to charge — the training I had given him while I was disguised as a gladiator working excellently. </p><p>“Defend,” carried one of the mages, taking initiative since the sorcerers were busy with their spells. He was dressed better than others, marking him as one of noble origin. The rest of the mages followed his order and started raining spells to prevent me from reaching the sorcerers, or at least, delay my approach until they could adjust their spells. </p><p>But such an achievement required a couple of seconds, a time more than enough for my mount to cover the distance. My spear was already lashing out, but I didn’t aim at the soldiers, as they were easily handled by my mount. </p><p>No, my spear targeted the panicked spells of the mages, breaking them up before they could touch me or my mount. Soon, I was in the middle of their formation, and two of the mages had already fallen victim to the claws of my mount. </p><p>Then, a wall of flame exploded between me and the sorcerers, far too quick for me to use the spear to destabilize its construction before it showed an effect, blocking my path to them, too thick to be taken down easily, taller than most buildings. </p><p>Killing sorcerers was not an easy task, especially when the two of them turned their full attention to cast a defensive spell. </p><p>Luckily, I didn’t need to kill them. With their magic linked to cast their overwhelming defensive spell, I continued my escape, without fearing their involvement. We disappeared at the end of the street before the sorcerers could cast a spell, the irregular attempts of the mages easily demolished by a slash of my spear. </p><p>Yet, I didn’t charge toward the gate, but changed the direction toward the center of Rome, where many sorcerers were locked in a deadlock.  </p><p>They had already felt the presence of a fight, which didn’t help the tenseness of their confrontation. In such a moment, an unknown like me, bursting into the scene, was all that was needed to trigger their battle. </p><p>I didn’t even need to enter their field of view, just getting close to them before flaring my magic was enough to trigger their battle, each side doing their best to finish before the reinforcements arrived on the other side. </p><p>And, in such a tense situation, two battles that exploded back to back were all that was needed to make the others react as well. </p><p>Magic flared all along the city… </p><p>“Mission accomplished,” I smirked as I charged toward the meeting location.</p>",

    "content": "<p>After the unusual study session with my new training tutor, the rest of my week passed in a weird routine. </p><p>The routine didn’t mean easy, as almost every single hour was filled with back-breaking effort.  </p><p>Every morning, I woke up at five to meet with Coach Juana for special training. Those sessions were intensive as we worked on the same drills again and again, and she focused on fixing my technical deficiencies. Five was already early enough to make even the simplest effort feel grueling. And, Coach Juana had too much to prove to keep those training sessions light. </p><p>Not that I complained. I had a lot to prove as well, and I had more important things than just making a new career for myself. I needed to get into the team to get the necessary Intent, and Coach Juana’s training worked wonders to help me with that. </p><p>After that part came the training with the team, which was hardly any easier. While the group training had allowed me the opportunity to limit my effort if I wished, I didn’t want to take the risk. Coach Bill was clearly paying attention, and I didn’t want to give him any excuse to limit my playing time. Not only I worked as much as it was manageable during the training, but I stayed in the field after for some voluntary reps. </p><p>Every day, I was the last one to leave the field. </p><p>I needed to sell my commitment.</p><p>After the training finished, I had the classes, though I skipped them to meet with Lauren for chess practice, playing chess for four hours rather than sleeping. The change of pace was beneficial, especially since the Recovery helped me to handle the after-effects of the training without getting a nap. </p><p>Of course, chess practice was not just for serious matters, as I managed to convince her to finish every day with another strip of chess, only for her to win every single one of them, only to balk when I was reduced to my underwear. So, just to mess with her, I started to wear tighter and thinner underwear each day, enjoying her monumental blush.   </p><p>After the chess practice, I went back to my room, and worked on the customized web crawler I coded for myself, focusing on the news, and aggressively working on it to catch anything suspicious. </p><p>It was yet to deliver anything useful, and even with the assistance my traits provided, required a lot of effort to reach a useful level, but after that near miss, I decided to make sure I had the information I needed. </p><p>There was no guarantee where the next surprise would arrive. </p><p>In the same vein, I used several of the user credentials I managed to get from the museum that sourced the mysterious orb to make sure every link between Sunset College and the delivery of the orb was scrubbed of their databases successfully. </p><p>Just to make sure, after erasing everything, I even triggered a system crash, ruining all the backups as well, making sure there was no hope of recovery.</p><p>Of course, doing so created months of work for the museum employees as they logged everything by hand, but considering the stakes I was playing, it was a fair trade. </p><p>From my perspective, of course. </p><p>And after those computer sessions, it was time for evening training, which meant it was time for another stadium trip. Once again, I did my best to show off both during the training, and stayed for voluntary practice, staying to make sure I was the last player leaving the stadium. </p><p>And when I managed to return to my room, all I was able to do was throw myself into my bed. </p><p>Even with the Traits, it was a grueling program. </p><p>Fortunately — or unfortunately, from the perspective of having fun — Megan didn’t communicate with me any, showing she didn’t need any assistance. And while some additional fun to break the monotony would have been fun, I doubted I could handle the chaos her intervention would bring. </p><p>I was already busy enough. </p><p>Without recovery, allowing me to start every day fresh, I would have probably got injured, or at least, unable to move due to unbearable muscle pain. There was a reason for the schedule of the professional athletes was less intense than mine, and it was certainly not their laziness. </p><p>Yet, that intense week wasn’t without a reward, I thought as I opened my locker Sunday morning, only to find a new jersey. </p><p>Number fifty-two. </p><p>But with my name on the back. </p><p>As I pulled it on, whispers exploded around me, their gaze bouncing between me and Carter. Understandable, as it was Carter’s old number, and now he was wearing number fifty-four. </p><p>A shocking declaration considering it was my first game.  </p><p>“Good work,” Carter said as he patted my back, much to the shock of everyone else, but I just nodded, understanding what drove him. I knew that it was him that requested it from Coach Bill in the first place — as forcibly changing player numbers were excessive even for him — to sell the story of his sacrifice to the professional scouts. </p><p>That Carter was willing to take a lesser role in their team without ego problems if necessary. </p><p>As I put on my jersey and walked toward the center of the room, Coach Spencer walked into the room, followed by the offensive coordinator — one that I didn’t even know the name of — and Coach Bill. </p><p>“Today, we’re fighting for the honor of our school…” Coach Spencer shouted, which marked the beginning of a long speech. </p><p>I had to admit, it was a good speech. </p><p>This was why it was a pity as it was delivered by our spineless, soft, head coach. Even the offensive players had an indulging expression on their faces, and the defensive players deliberately stayed in the outside circle to reinforce the impression. </p><p>“Let’s go, Pirates,” he finally called. </p><p>“Let’s go!” the team exclaimed, and we moved to the field. </p><p>The team had been experiencing a monumental loss streak, but, interestingly, that didn’t prevent the stands from being full, the people shouting and crying the team slogan repeatedly as we walked onto the field. </p><p>I expected a lot of Intent to be gained from playing football. It was the whole point of working extremely hard, just to have a chance to wear the uniform. </p><p>Yet, it seemed that I underestimated the passion people had for the game. Even before the start, making anything that would get their attention, I could feel the Intent flow getting thicker. Not enough to allow me to channel it to the system, but barely below that limit. </p><p>And I didn’t even step into the field. </p><p>Impressive. </p><p>With the relationship between the defensive team and the head coach, it wasn’t surprising to see it was the offensive captain that went for the coin flip rather than Carter. They flipped the coin, and our team won the coin toss. </p><p>Naturally, our team chose to play the offense first. </p><p>“Be ready to go,” Thad said to me as he walked closer as gestured to our quarterback, who had overthrown his pass rather badly to avoid a surprise blitz. “Arnie can’t handle the pressure properly, and they started with a blitz. It’s going to be three-and-out.” </p><p>Three-and-out, meaning our team would fail to get the ten-yard progression in three attempts, which would force the team to punt. </p><p>To the credit of the offense, our starting quarterback Arnie — Arnold — managed to throw a good pass on his third attempt, bringing us to forty yards in our field, and setting up fresh first dawn. </p><p>Unfortunately, that seemed to be the limit of his, as three attempts with no return forced our team to punt. </p><p>Pity that, as a starter — even as a new one — I wasn’t a part of the special teams, making me watch from the corner as our team punted, with a pathetic gain of thirty feet as the punter shanked the ball badly. </p><p>“Let’s show how the real pirates play the game,” Thad growled as he raised his hand. The whole team roared as we walked onto the field,  showing that, Carter and I might be the strategic leaders on the field, but neither of us was the emotional leader of the team. </p><p>Not that I had a problem with that. </p><p>As a tall giant with a good attitude — at least to his teammates, and I doubted the opponent that received one of his painful tackles would agree — and the kind of charm that made everyone like him, he was a good emotional leader. </p><p>And, his emotional weight allowed me to focus on the real issue. </p><p>Making sure we leave a good impression.  </p><p>I took a deep breath, trying to ignore the excitement of stepping into the field for the first time in four years. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Lauren watched her students beat a hasty retreat. </p><p>“So, we’re alone,” I said as I sat in front of Lauren, a teasing smile on my face. “Is there anything you want from me, my dear tutor?” </p><p>It took a few seconds for her to recover enough. “What have you done was wrong,” she said, finally managing to suppress her shock of watching the rest of the team retreat in fear. “You should be nicer to your teammates.” </p><p>“Not unless they actually start working,” I answered with a scoff. “They are adults. They should be responsible enough not to waste anyone’s time, especially someone with actual ambitions rather than just getting a management position in their daddy’s firm. What’s the point of treating them with respect when they don’t respect our time.” </p><p>“Still…” she whispered, but before she could continue, I pressed my fingers to her lips, silencing her, her blush spectacular. Her eyes widened at my touch, which was certainly an overreach even with our flirting, but she was just shy enough to accept that as long as I didn’t push it anymore. </p><p>“Let’s not waste any more time with useless people. So, you’re the new tutor of the team?” I asked. </p><p>“Y-yeah,” she stammered, unable to resist my attempt to change the topic. “The coordinator asked me to volunteer some time to help since I’m already an employee of the college.” </p><p>“Excellent, then, let’s play, two minutes, five seconds follow up,” I said as I pulled the chess set in front of me, and quickly set up the board. Without waiting for a second, I opened with the king-side pawn, and pressed the clock. </p><p>“R-right now?” she stammered. </p><p>“Yes, and your time is ticking out,” I answered, more than happy to ambush her with a quick game, one that she was at a significant disadvantage. </p><p>She tried to respond with a queen-side opening, making a defensive move. Technically, it was not a bad move, a solid defense. </p><p>But it gave me the initiative to attack. </p><p>And, I was just annoying enough to prefer a crazy assault, more than happy to leverage her mistakes. Of course, such an assault was not without its costs, easily destroyed if she changed her strategy into something remotely aggressive to leverage the gaps between my assault. </p><p>But she didn’t, which gave her a defeat before we reached move fifteen. “You need to work on your mindset, you’re still getting flustered too easily, I said. </p><p>“You ambushed me,” she answered, her beautiful face contorted in annoyance. “I would have won if I was calmer.” </p><p>“I know,” I said. “But can you guarantee that you wouldn’t feel flustered once you’re in a big tournament, facing one of the top ten players of the world? An ambush is a good way to simulate your mood.” </p><p>“It’s not the same as an ambush,” she murmured rebelliously, but her voice lacked the necessary conviction. </p><p>“Oh, really?” I whispered. “So, you’re saying that you can handle another source of stress easily.” </p><p>“O-of course,” she stammered, her answer arriving automatically, before she truly understood the carte blanche she gave to me with those words. </p><p>I said nothing as I stood up and walked to the door, which took just a couple steps thanks to the smallness of the room. Yet, rather than leaving, I locked the door before returning to my seat. </p><p>“W-what’s going on?” she stammered. </p><p>“We’re going to play more, but in a way that properly pressurizes you,” I said. “Every loss means a loss of clothing item, until you can’t handle more.” </p><p>“T-that’s nonsense,” she stammered. “I … I won’t undress here, in the middle of the school.” </p><p>I smirked. “So, you don’t have a problem with the plan, just the location?” I asked, which only earned a beautiful blush off her. “Don’t worry, I had checked before. The lock is strong enough to keep intruders away,” I said. </p><p>Then, without waiting for her answer, I quickly set the game again and started, once again playing the white. </p><p>“T-that’s nonsense,” she stammered under my gaze. “I … I won’t play.” </p><p>“You’re losing time,” I said smugly, gesturing at the clock, using the moment to subtly pressure her. </p><p>“Y-you’re a jerk,” she stammered, yet the pressure worked. She reached to make her first move. </p><p>She was even more unsettled than before, making it an easy thing to earn the victory. Luckily for her, while I was a jerk, I still had my limits, and deliberately extended the game without putting her at too much disadvantage, giving her an opportunity to recover. </p><p>And, once she recovered, she demolished me even with the recent improvements in my Traits. </p><p>She was truly amazing. “I … I won,” she stammered victoriously. </p><p>“Well, you did. Good game,” I said, then removed my shirt in one smooth move, leaving my torso naked, much to her shock. </p><p>“What are you doing?” she gasped as she closed her face with her hands. Amusingly, I could see her peeking between her fingers in a manner she no doubt assumed to be subtle. </p><p>“Paying the cost of failure, of course,” I said. “I lost the game, which meant I lost a piece of clothing. So, are you willing to play another game, or was that enough for today?” </p><p>“T-this is nonsense,” she said as she dipped her head down, her face getting even redder. Amusingly, that didn’t prevent her from setting the game once again without saying anything. Then, she made a move and triggered the clock, showing she might have other faults, but she was certainly not a slow learner. </p><p>Using my tricks against me. </p><p>“Impressive,” I said as I did my best to defend against her assault. This time, it was a more even game, but despite my best efforts, I lost. </p><p>Without her frustration to help me, she was not an opponent I could defeat easily. </p><p>Luckily, the rules of our little bet made sure that the more we played, the more advantageous we got, regardless of winning or losing. </p><p>Of course, there was nothing that was forcing her to play. Other than the way her eyes were locked to my hips as I stood up and unbuttoned my jeans, pushing them down slightly. Yet, just as they reached halfway, I stopped. “Oh, we were just playing for one piece of clothing,” I murmured, smirking as I removed a shoe instead. </p><p>“That’s how you want to play,” she growled with a sudden passion. She wouldn’t have reacted like that if I just removed my shoe, but after being tempted by the idea of a slow striptease, it was much different. </p><p>“Yes, that’s how I want to play,” I said with a smirk, and we started another game. And, her annoyance worked wonders to distract her, making her lose herself in an overly aggressive assault, allowing me to deliver a deadly counter-attack. </p><p>Losing didn’t frustrate her much, considering my earlier trick allowed her to copy it and she kicked off her shoes. </p><p>Though, unlike me, she was wearing elegant pumps, meaning she didn’t have socks underneath, which meant that I had the advantage. For the next four games, I lost the three of them, and she only lost one, yet we both ended up with naked feet. </p><p>“It’s not fair, you are wearing more,” she stammered. </p><p>“I’m also losing more,” I said with a smirk. “I just have two pieces remaining to your four, it’s hardly the point for you to change your mind,” I said with a chuckle. “Of course, we can stop if you think the game is unfair.” </p><p>“N-no need,” she stammered, her words leaving her mouth hurriedly. “We can just finish the game.” </p><p>“As you wish,” I said as I started another game, doing my best to resist her assault, only to fail spectacularly. With the victory in her grasp, she attacked much better than I expected. </p><p>So, I stood up, swaying to the rhythm of imaginary music. Even with the great assistance Agility was providing, I was not a good dancer. But, as Lauren looked at me with unblinking eyes, it didn’t seem to matter to her. She was more interested in the way my muscles were contracting with every move hungrily. </p><p>For a shy girl, she was surprisingly horny once tempted. </p><p>Soon, I let the jeans slip down, revealing my muscular legs, my underwear the only thing that was between me and total nudity. Unfortunately for her, my boxers were more substantial than the speedos I had modeled the day before, hiding them from her gaze. </p><p>Yet, I couldn’t help but feel amused at the way her gaze dropped down, her disappointment clear. </p><p>“Unfortunately, that part is not yet willing to join the show. It requires a bit to bring it to attention,” I said. “Maybe you’ll be interested in that.” </p><p>I could feel her temptation. The attraction in her gaze was clear. The combination of my bad-boy charm and my ability to put a decent competition against her in chess worked wonders on her even before Seduction Trait was added to the mix, giving me a plethora of tricks I could use. </p><p>I didn’t push Seduction to the limit against her. On the contrary, I barely tapped into its benefits, but even that was enough to turn into a total mess. I enjoyed her silence as I sat down once again, and quickly set the game once again. </p><p>“Another game?” I offered. </p><p>She looked at me, arousal battling against her shyness. </p><p>Unfortunately, the latter won. </p><p>“M-maybe another day,” she stammered as she jumped to her feet suddenly, the realization of the moment hitting her hard. </p><p>She dashed away after grabbing her shoes, not even bothering to put them on. I did nothing, just watching in amusement as she fumbled with the key desperately. “I-it’s not opening,” she begged. </p><p>“Try pulling the door rather than pushing,” I said, unable to keep my chuckles as she blushed even more. I received an angry glare, mixed with shame, which only made me chuckle harder. </p><p>“See you tomorrow,” I said as a chuckle, watching her disappear. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Silence ruled the room, only interrupted by the clapping of my body against the warrior, drilling inside her aggressively. </p><p>Pity that the realization of her nature as a magical puppet reduced the pleasure I was receiving from her significantly. Luckily, not to the point of ruining it completely, especially after I had discovered a way to amplify their connection with the controller and enhance her pleasure. </p><p>It was possible only because there was no real distinction between her control and the feedback she received from them. She was able to reduce the impact somewhat, but blocking it completely was not an option. </p><p>And, I had already discovered the ability to interfere with that connection, increasing the feedback she was receiving despite her best attempts to muffle the connection. </p><p>It was not a move completely free of risk, and doing so was certainly different than my earlier actions, but finally penetrating the veil of mystery that surrounded her, I once again had the luxury of taking some calculated risks rather than playing save. </p><p>Albeit, the implication of her abilities was certainly interesting. On the one hand, they were certainly more impressive than I had expected. Creating both realistic puppets with their own levels and abilities had many potentials. Especially considering they could function as real people, to the point it actually tricked my detection capabilities. </p><p>Not to mention, tricking the System as well, as evidenced by the notification I received. </p><p>[+1000 Experience]</p><p>Yet, the more I learned about her impressive abilities, the less threatening she become. The reason was twofold. The first part was the clear limitation of the clone ability. I doubted that she would miss using her fake skills in such an important situation if she had other options. </p><p>Certainly not when skills like healing would have solved most of her problems. </p><p>Ironically, that little problem wouldn’t have been a big drawback in combat. There were many spells that could be used to dull the sense of pain of the puppets, protecting the controller from the more unpleasant aspects of the deep connection. </p><p>The same didn’t apply to a seduction mission, especially not when the target was an expert mage. Using such a spell would be an excellent cause for suspicion. </p><p>It was completely redundant at this point, of course. The poor princess didn’t know her secrets were already exposed, making her struggle against the feedback from her puppets her warrior puppet a vain struggle. Not for nothing, of course, as her moans certainly helped me with my mood.  </p><p>Unaware of her situation, she continued struggling against the feedback. I didn’t bother pacing myself, neither in terms of my physical effort, nor in terms of enhancing the feedback. The monumental reveal about her attempted thievery in the headmistress’ office being discovered distracted her from focusing on why she started receiving such an intense flow of feedback. </p><p>That dilemma carried my thoughts to the second drawback of her abilities — thought that was less of a fundamental aspect, and more about her unique circumstances. </p><p>She was the only one that could use that ability. </p><p>Initially, I was reluctant to challenge her little group, because I was under impression that she had a small cadre of loyal followers, which, when combined with the ability to create fake skills and configure their stats based on the requirements of the situation, would have created an intimidating and dangerous challenge.  </p><p>Yet, the fact that she was handling a task as unglamorous as a seduction mission — to convince the target to forgive her when she tried to take revenge for her loss of control due to pleasure — strongly implied that no one else could replicate her ability. </p><p>Either the ability was unique to her, or she didn’t trust anyone. </p><p>It didn’t matter which was the case. Either way, it significantly degraded the dangerous potential she represented, making it viable for me to finally start poking into the mysteries that surrounded her. </p><p>And, there were a lot of mysteries that needed to be unraveled. Important questions. Why was she suddenly fighting with the other members of the royal family? Why did a faction of Eternals decide to support the other princes? How could she actually create fake skills and magical puppets realistic enough to actually trick the system? </p><p>Compared to that, the exact nature of the mission she wanted to send me to the capital, and the nature of the so-called keepsake were certainly a lesser mystery. </p><p>But the lesser nature of it didn’t make it any less important. </p><p>After all, one first needed to find where the yarn started before unraveling a mess. </p><p>“About the mission,” I reminded the princess through Delia, even as I grabbed her breast for contrast while the warrior continued to jump up and down. “Tell me why your princess is desperate enough to make two of her most loyal supporters whore themselves,” I said, then followed with a chuckle. “Not that you two seem to be minding,” I added when Delia echoed the moan of the warrior. </p><p>The pleasure echoing between the two was truly making a challenge for the princess to stay silent, her own moans echoing between her puppets — still under the impression that the isolation wards she created holding strong. </p><p>“It’s a personal mission, but one that was of utter importance to the princess,” Delia started, launching a detailed explanation about the challenges of the mission. </p><p>I had to admire the princess’ willpower and political acumen, as even with the constant distraction she was struggling under, she was able to deliver her expression perfectly, focusing on the tactical challenges of the mission more and more, doing her best to pull away me from the more important question. </p><p>Like, what was the item that she went all this trouble to acquire? Or whether the item carried any real importance in the first place, or the mission was there just to pull the headmistress into her political battle.</p><p>I didn’t ask those questions, giving her the impression that her distraction attempt was successful. I did so, because I wanted to show her that two beautiful women working together on me would work wonders to distract me. </p><p>I certainly wouldn’t mind a repeat the next time she wanted something, and there were other rewards to that. </p><p>[+3000 Experience]</p><p>As her explanation continued, I continued to ram into the beautiful entrance of the warrior while squeezing Delia’s breasts, their supple bodies creating an amazing view in front of me. As I continued that, I asked some operational questions to Delia, reinforcing the impression that I was lost in the operational details of the mission. </p><p>Convincing the princess that it was a viable method of tricking me into doing what she wanted was the superior choice. </p><p>With my growing understanding of her abilities, I finally had the courage to sneak into her residence, poking around to discover her secrets. I could use a more direct approach whenever I wanted, after all. </p><p>With that decision done, I turned my attention to the two magical constructs that were doing wonders allowing me to teach the princess the meaning of pleasure remotely. Still, I marveled at the expanse of flesh sprawled in front of me, drinking the alluring sight of the magical marvel in front of me. </p><p>As the princess’ explanation — through Delia — started to get more and more useless as she got lost in details, I focused my attention on the next challenge — that whether I could make the princess collapse through indirect pleasure. </p><p>For that aim, I cast a spell to make Delia float, and bring her above me, her legs on my shoulders, her core inches away from my lips. Once again, I dove into her delicious treasure, my tongue lashing out like a parched man stumbling across an oasis, enjoying her wetness. </p><p>Three sources of moans mixed — two puppets and the princess — into a beautiful symphony as I worked on my assault, my physical abilities targeting the puppets while my magical trickeries were busy enhancing the feedback those puppets were sent to the princess, creating a beautiful harmony. </p><p>Soon, the princess’ attempts to explain the mission stopped completely as she turned her full attention to handle the intense assault of pleasure for several uninterrupted minutes. </p><p>[+5000 Experience]</p><p>Yet, as I cycled through positions, I noticed one very important detail — through my constant connection with the mana string she was using to control the puppets. Her control was getting rougher and rougher, and while the intense pleasure that made it hard for her to think was a factor, I also started to see the more ordinary signs of exhaustion. </p><p>Managing two puppets at the same time was clearly an exhausting challenge for her. </p><p>That wasn’t enough to earn my mercy, not when she was ruthless enough to pull me in her political games — clearly hoping to plunge all Silver Spires into that endless pit — even as she continued to lose ground in other aspects.  </p><p>I continued to show her the extent of my carnal abilities as our bodies wrapped and danced, kisses merging into blowjobs, spanks, and chains leveraged aggressively, feeling curious when the princess would finally ask for an end. </p><p>She managed to resist for almost an hour, but before it ended, I received several other notifications. </p><p>[+27204 Experience]</p><p>[Level Up!] </p><p>[Grandmaster Tantric (113/140)]</p><p>[Warning! Divine Spark is depleted. Connect with more Divine Sparks to continue supporting the System of ———]</p><p>Leveling up was certainly nice, but the pleasure it generated was quickly countered by the other notification about lack of experience, especially since I had fed the System with Divine Spark several times, only for its effectiveness to lessen significantly with each repeat. </p><p>The system was getting greedier. </p><p>“I — I don’t think I can last for more,” Delia gasped as I filled her again. Interestingly, through the connection, I could feel that it was the princess who was on the edge of a collapse. The endless pleasure, combined with the strain of maintaining two puppets proved too much for her. </p><p>“That was a nice apology,” I said as I looked at her, enjoying the way the connection continued to flicker. I was tempted to tell her that it was still not enough to earn a proper apology, but with the System once again asking for Divine Spark I had no practical reason to extend it. </p><p>Also, I was afraid that the princess would just collapse if I pushed her more, which would have likely caused her magical puppets to stop working, which would force me to confront her. </p><p>I would rather do that on my own terms. </p><p>I smirked at the state of her exhaustion — felt through the connection with her puppets — even as I quickly fixed my clothing and walked toward the door. </p><p>“W-will you do the mission?” muttered Delia. </p><p>“Sure, why not,” I answered. “You certainly worked hard to earn that answer.” Just like that, despite her exhaustion, anger flared on her face, tempting me to push a bit more. </p><p>Instead, I left the room, leaving them alone… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 36 Experience: 631374 / 630000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 7334 / 7334 Mana: 9000 / 9000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Grandmaster Tantric [114/140]</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [85/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Titania - Level 35/38]</p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Marianne - Level 21/29]</p>",

    "content": "<p>An enthusiastic smile invaded my face as I threw myself back, only to meet with the comfortable surface of the cushion, large enough to serve as a bed. </p><p>Albeit it would be difficult to fit all three of us, I was confident in my abilities to find a way. </p><p>I pulled the chain that was connected to the neck of the warrior, quickening her helpless crawl toward the cushion as the chain tightened. It would have been a cruel move if it wasn’t for the fact that she was just a construct. </p><p>The fact that she was a construct didn’t prevent signs of her intense anger, enough to bury her discomfort. </p><p>Delia was quick to stand next to me, her beautiful body on display, her amazing nudity and sexy pose almost enough to distract me from the intense, barely hidden anger she wore on her face, matching the one on the face of the warrior. </p><p>Of course, Delia’s intensity of it was too personal, but knowing she was also a construct, just helped me to make sure there was only one controller. </p><p>Also, it was her own fault that she brought the warrior out with a chain. I was just a poor man. </p><p>“Why don’t you sit down while your friend finishes crawling toward us, just like she deserves,” I said, enjoying her impotent anger. </p><p>Ultimately, it was her fault for bringing her out with a chain… </p><p>She was quick to obey me and sat next to me. I shifted slightly, so that my shaft rested against her legs, my touch enough to awaken her desire, and join to her intense anger. </p><p>The best part, the arousal was not fake.</p><p>I used the distraction my touch created on the controller to stretch a string of mana and touched the wards that were protecting the room. Most of the wards were strong enough that it would take considerably more than a momentary touch to unravel, but luckily, some of the additional benefits were provided by additional layers. </p><p>One of those additional layers was the silencing ward, which took only a touch to modify to allow the sounds from the other side to reach my ear — and only my ear — to avoid the attention of the decoys. </p><p>I had no doubt about that aspect. If there was one emotion I could distinguish easily, it was the ability to see whether it was genuine arousal. With the way I leveled, there was simply no doubt about that. </p><p>And Delia’s arousal boomed without the slightest restriction, a great contrast to the last time we shared a breakfast where every move of hers was intensely guarded, and only the intensity of her need and my masterful manipulations loosened her defenses. </p><p>It seemed that the princess had a different approach to physical fun while not using her own body to do so.  </p><p>She had shown that she wasn’t exactly very resistant to the temptation of pleasure, both then and now. Of course, at this point, the identity of the controller being the princess was still a theory. </p><p>But I was confident in my guess. </p><p>Still, it was hard to argue the fact that, at this moment, knowing the true identity of the controller was just for my personal edification, and not a condition to enjoy the constructs that had been created for me. </p><p>And enjoy them, I did. </p><p>“Oh,” Delia gasped as I grabbed her breast, squeezing hard to enjoy their amazing texture, my other hand still tugging the warrior closer. Once again, I decided to multitask, and filled Delia’s body with my mana. </p><p>Not even bothering to hide. </p><p>“W-what are you doing?” she gasped in shock as she realized that, but despite the gasp, her tone lacked the fear someone else would have carried against such a move, nor did she try to defend herself. </p><p>Perks of interacting through a decoy. </p><p>That disconnected attitude didn’t last for long, not when I cast a little biomancy spell, one that increased her sensitivity a few times, twisting her nipple as I did so.</p><p>[-62 Mana]</p><p>“W-what are you doing?” she repeated, this time with an urgency in her tone. I smiled, but it wasn’t Delia’s reaction that surprised me.</p><p>But a soft cry, unmistakably female, very similar to the voice of Delia, but with certain minor differences. It came from the other side of the wall, audible without alerting Delia and the warrior thanks to the modifications I applied on the silencing ward. </p><p>“Punishing you, of course,” I said as I twisted her nipple again, but this time, there was no gasp of pain from behind the wall. The reason…</p><p>The sudden flare of mana appeared from the other side of the wall before it traveled toward Delia, modifying the structure of the decoy. </p><p>The princess was cheating. </p><p>It didn’t annoy me, because that mana stream was useful to me in many other ways. It was a subtle manipulation, one that I would have missed if I wasn’t directly observing the termination point of the connection, but with that, I was able to identify the flow — one that I followed by sending a small flicker of mana back. </p><p>Trying to intrude on someone from such a great distance would have been difficult if I couldn’t use her connection as a pathway, using it as a track. Even then, I wasn’t able to do much through that trick. It just confirmed my earlier assumption. </p><p>It was the woman I named as not-Delia on the other side of the wall, managing the two decoys. </p><p>“Oh, it’s too much,” Delia moaned as I continued to squeeze her breast, but the earlier intense urgency was gone, replaced by a fake tone. A believable fake tone thanks to all the acting and seduction skills the magical puppet contained, but fake nonetheless. </p><p>I had to admit, the princess’ ability to adjust the feedback she was receiving ruined the pleasure I was receiving from the moment significantly, enough to tempt me to stop. </p><p>I would have done so if it wasn’t for the notification I received. </p><p>[+2500 Experience]</p><p>I might be aware of the fake nature of the view in front of me, but the same didn’t apply to the system. That failure had quite a few interesting implications for the limitation of the System. </p><p>And it would be lying to say if the free flow of experience was unwelcome. </p><p>I leaned against Delia, and without a warning, pulled the warrior on my lap, sheathing inside her mercilessly, using the same sensitivity trick to enhance her pleasure before the princess could adjust. </p><p>My reward, was another muffled moan from the other side of the room. </p><p>Compared to her moans, the moans of her magical puppets didn’t entertain me as much. Instead, I turned to Delia and asked a question while squeezing her breast. “Tell me, what exactly is this mission, and why are you that desperate to actually make someone else take the blame for it?” </p><p>If there was one other benefit to the little show I was putting on, it sufficiently distracted the princess, which delayed the answer quite a bit. “T-that’s not the —“ she started, only for me to slap her breast, and the princess made a noise once more, this time moaning in shock, louder than the previous ones. </p><p>Of course, that was not the only trick I pulled. I timed that spank in an attempt to interfere with her connection with the puppet. Faking a completely new response would have been difficult, but enhancing an already existent communication was a much simpler trick. </p><p>And, since the princess didn’t react it by attacking — or retreating — but trying to adjust the sensitivity of her puppet, it was also not as obvious as I feared. </p><p>I watched her adjustments carefully, my mana senses working in conjunction with the understanding given to me by Biomancy skill working wonders to understand her tricks. </p><p>It didn’t take long for me to get a rudimentary control. Her tricks were certainly crude, little more than weakening or increasing all senses in a wholesale manner. And, since her mana manipulation abilities were smooth enough to achieve a more selective adjustment, I was more inclined to assume she lacked a healing-based skill to direct her. </p><p>Interesting, especially when considered together with her incredible ability to create fake skills. Pity the flimsy connection between us was not enough to explore the reason for that particular fact. </p><p>Still, it was good to know that there were limitations to such a scary ability.  </p><p>With her controller distracted, it took a while for the puppet to give the answer — not that I minded it while the second puppet allowed me to fill the time by allowing me to get closer to another level up.</p><p>[+2000 Experience]</p><p>“But, the princess —“ Delia managed to say, only to be interrupted by another spank — with the feedback enhanced, making the princess moan once more. </p><p>I decided to tease the princess a bit more. “Since she sent you two here to whore yourselves, the princess clearly needs this mission. What do you think I would not only decide not to do it, but go have a talk with the headmistress and make sure no one else from the school is allowed to do it?” </p><p>“No, please!” Delia gasped, this time a genuine panic — as indicated by a gasp that came from the other side of the room. </p><p>“Then, speak. I want every single detail about it. For example, why this mission is important enough that the other princes already started sending their agents to observe Silver Spires?”</p><p>“T-they wouldn’t—“ she started, only to receive another slap to her beautiful tits, the impact once again enough to make the princess gasp in pain, yet she was distracted enough to realize I had fiddled with her ward that was supposed to keep her silent, her beautiful real moans mixing with the fake gasps of her puppets. </p><p>“Honey, just because I’m paying attention to this slut —“ I said, slapping her ass to highlight my point — once again enhanced to get a moan off the princess — “… doesn’t mean that I suddenly lost my ability to think. The princess suddenly decides someone working directly under the headmistress to a sensitive mission in the capital rather than one of her loyal and capable handmaidens,” I murmured, then smirked. “Like the one that was good enough to actually get into the headmistress’ office without being noticed if I hadn’t been there,” I added. </p><p>This time, her reaction was much more spectacular. Both puppets started to gather their mana, ready to attack, but I just grabbed the chain around the throat of the warrior, activating the spell I buried on it while putting my other hand on Delia, challenging her attempt to gather mana. </p><p>Interestingly, while I felt the princess also gather her mana, it was much less than I expected, probably as a result of the puppets occupying her capabilities. </p><p>“Calm down, the headmistress doesn’t know about that yet,” I said with a soothing voice, then grabbed Delia’s tits once again. </p><p>“And, she wouldn’t know as long as you continue to be a good puppet,” I added, unable to suppress the temptation of throwing a little hint at the end. </p><p>They stilled, their mana calming down. I chuckled as I grabbed the hips of the warrior and quickened my invasion, using her to push toward the next level while they tried to get a handle on the latest revelation. </p><p>The visit was developing in a more interesting direction than I first expected…</p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 35 Experience: 604170 / 630000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 7140 / 7140 Mana: 8561 / 8750 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Grandmaster Tantric [114/130]</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [85/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Titania - Level 35/38]</p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Marianne - Level 21/29]</p>",

    "content": "<p>After I passed her phone back, I didn’t say anything for a moment, keeping my expression inscrutable intentionally, letting her feel the stress of the moment, enjoying the hesitant glare she sent toward the door. </p><p>But I wasn’t cruel enough to extend that for more than a moment. </p><p>“I like your determination,” I said as I walked toward my camera, leaving Laura standing in front of Penny, shuffling uncomfortably under her piercing gaze. </p><p>I knew that it was just a weak facade Penny managed to somehow fake through practice, ready to shatter at the slightest pushback, but Laura was certainly not the one that would test that. </p><p>Not when she committed to the opportunity to finally have her big break!  </p><p>Amusingly, despite having all the hallmarks of a horrible decision, she wasn’t actually making a bad choice. I was probably one of the best fashion photographers in the state if not the best, and considering the others weren’t desperately struggling to find decent newcomers, forced to do so after ruining their chances in the general market, it wasn’t like she had any comparable options.  </p><p>And, to her luck, I had just tapped into a lucrative new revenue channel, and needed some new material to enhance the benefits. </p><p>That thought reminded me to check the performance of the business during the night. I reached to my phone first, to check the number of new customers that I had managed to find. After all, it was pretty early last night when I last checked — before I got distracted by Penny’s amazing breasts. </p><p>I expected at least a dozen new paying customers, maybe even a couple dozens if I was particularly lucky. </p><p>“I must be going blind,” I murmured as I checked the screen, freezing for a moment. There was no other explanation for the number I was seeing on the screen, almost ten times the number I had seen before I had gone to bed. </p><p>“Something wrong?” Penny asked, reminding me that I was looking at the screen for a long while. </p><p>“Nothing, sweetie, I just received a job offer with a nice number of zeroes,” I answered, not really wanting to delve deep into the details of the business. No need to ruin the magic, after all. </p><p>Incredible, I thought as I searched where my website was being mentioned, only to find it being mentioned in several niche fantasy and science fiction forums, along with an incredible number of mentions of Nancy’s book, with some very glowing reviews. </p><p>Nancy would have a nice surprise when she woke up and see the number of sales. I didn’t have access to that, but with the number of mentions, I expected it to be impressively high. </p><p>Yet, as I raised my head once again, the camera in my hand, I had a serious expression on my face. The sudden success was a happy occasion, but I was experienced with the marketing side of things, enough to know that such a sudden flare of popularity would be fleeting unless one reacted in time and fueled it further. </p><p>Luckily, Laura arrived just in time to provide me with that fuel. A few mysterious shoots of a new model, just enough to stir the pot, would give it a push that would keep alive for a few days, which was all that was needed for me to work with my existing models for something more interesting. </p><p>But first, my new model. </p><p>“So, you are determined to be a model,” I asked. Laura froze, no doubt surprised by the sudden sharpness of my tone, expecting a much more carnal audition after the photos she had shown me. </p><p>“Y-yes,” she whispered after a short delay. Meanwhile, recognizing the shift in my tone, Penny took a few rapid steps back and left a wide area for Laura to work. </p><p>“I expect my models to answer my questions promptly,” I answered even as I raised my camera. </p><p>“S-sorry,” she stammered. </p><p>“Don’t apologize, just do better,” I pushed back, deliberately harsh as I tried to understand how she reacted to the pressure under a camera, which would give me the best way to handle her. Some models, like Nicole and Penny, worked best under a firm, unyielding hand, while others, like Nancy, required better challenges and teasing. “Now, give me a neutral pose and a soft smile,” I ordered. </p><p>Laura followed that order quickly, and a fleeting smile appeared on my face as I watched the speed she displayed as she followed the direction. Furthermore, the pose she took was decent enough, suggesting she actually had the potential to be nurtured. </p><p>Especially considering just how urgent I needed some decent model assistance. </p><p>“Not bad,” I said even as I pressed the shutter several times, taking her pictures. They were useless, of course, as I neither bothered to fix her pose, nor adjusted the lightning accurately, yet they were still vital. </p><p>I needed her to get used to the constant explosion of flash without flinching, and there was no better cure than repeated exposure. </p><p>It also gave me an opportunity to get a better feel of the details of her attitude, from the way her body swayed to her balance, almost like a private trainer, but it was just another facet of being a photographer. </p><p>At least, a good one. </p><p>“Now, try to lean forward, and cross your arms under your chest,” I said, moving to a pose that could be construed as revealing. Normally, I wouldn’t have pushed for such an adventurous angle that quickly with a new model, but considering her selection of audition photos, I felt like it was not exactly a great risk. </p><p>“How about this,” she asked as she leaned forward, even more than necessary as her arms crossed under her chest and pushed it up, enhancing her cleavage beautifully. She might lack Penny’s great bosom, but she still had enough assets to make the pose alluring. </p><p>“Not bad,” I answered, noting the way she perked up, suggesting that she was not the kind that flourished under an iron fist, nor she was as combative as Nancy. </p><p>A more playful touch would work best, I decided. </p><p>Not exactly a big challenge. I ordered her into several other simple poses with varying revealing aspects. Some, like asking her to stand up, were rather straightforward. The others, making her turn her back and touch her toes, revealed much more thanks to the assistance of her mini skirt. </p><p>I had to admit, for all the challenges it brought, there was a certain charm in working with a new model, watching as her doubts and fears slowly melted away, replaced by a beautiful kind of self-confidence, one that had obedience seeped into its core, each order further reinforcing that core. </p><p>Altogether, it had a certain beauty.</p><p>As I took my photos, I glanced toward Penny occasionally, watching as her arousal slowly reached a new level. The direction of her gaze was enough to confirm that it was almost completely about the authority I was reflecting on rather than the increasingly revealing poses Laura displayed. </p><p>It was interesting. Penny was certainly not a bi, but her obedience was intense enough to allow her to treat the other ladies in the room passionately as long as it made me happy. </p><p>Unlike Nancy, who was certainly more enthusiastic about the flavor of the female touch, making her an even better candidate to test Laura properly. </p><p>However, Nancy was still sleeping after her exhausting ordeal — both the convention which was important enough to determine the fate of her book, which she worked on for years, and the carnal activities both preceded and followed the convention — leaving Penny as the only option. </p><p>Not that she seemed particularly broken about that case, I noted as I looked at Penny, just one gesture enough for her to understand my order, and she started walking toward Laura in beautiful, sauntering steps. </p><p>Her sexy obedience was always enough to put a smile on my face even if her lingering steps and the exaggerated swing of her hips didn’t loosen her robe even further, giving an enhanced view of her beautiful bosom. </p><p>I had seen her naked many times, but that didn’t mean I stopped enjoying it. After all, sunsets didn’t lose their magnificence just because of repetition. </p><p>Penny stood behind Laura, almost hovering above her, though it was more about the posture rather than height difference, as while Penny had three inches over Laura, Laura’s heels were tall enough to compensate for that difference. </p><p>My initial plan was to give a couple orders to Penny, but seeing her stance, begging for an excuse to make Laura payback for her early morning interruption, I decided to give her a chance. </p><p>“Penny, why don’t you take control as the more experienced model and show her the ropes,” I said as I looked at her, throwing a wink at her. </p><p>Penny just nodded, her expression shy, but that expression was quick to disappear as she turned her gaze to Laura, her smirk wide. “Let’s see you’re as good as you think you are,” she whispered as she put her hands on Laura’s waist. “Let’s start with a sexy pose,” she added as she leaned forward, stopping just before their lips touched. </p><p>I pressed the camera rapidly, focused on catching Laura’s beautiful expression, an abject shock overwhelming her earlier determination, the intervention enough to shake her. </p><p>So much that, she missed where Penny’s hands were currently busy, only noticing after Penny managed to open three of her blouse buttons, turning her revealing cleavage into an erotic display,  especially since she only had a lacy, transparent bra underneath, one that barely covered her nipples. </p><p>And, considering their transparent nature, that coverage didn’t exactly help the nature of the photo, qualifying the photo into the erotic territory. </p><p>Laura whimpered in shock as Penny put her hands on her waist, signaling that things were getting heated. </p><p>However, before she could push for more, a shocked gasp came from the bedroom. “Impossible,” Nancy shouted, suggesting that she had decided to check her sales numbers. A more inexperienced man might have cursed the sudden twist ruining the mood. </p><p>Me, I decided to push the opportunity to the next level. </p><p>“Penny. I need to check with Nancy. Why don’t you help Laura pick a swimsuit for the next stage of the set, the room comes with a good selection,” I said, enjoying Laura’s shock. </p><p>Though, whether it was about the reminder that Penny wasn’t the only model currently in the penthouse, or the sudden realization that she had to undress together with the handsy blonde, that was to be seen. </p><p>A mystery for later, I decided as I walked toward the bedroom, leaving them behind for their mischievous adventure.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",
