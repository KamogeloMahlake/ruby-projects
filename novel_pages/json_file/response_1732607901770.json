By the way, I like tall women with a big ass.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>So I didn’t hear it wrong?</p><p><br></p><p>Who asks this kind of question at the beginning of the battle?</p><p><br></p><p>Is this some kind of trigger for his Curse Technique?</p><p><br></p><p>“I….guess I like cute girls.” I answered unsurely.</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh? What kind of answer is that? Everyone likes cute girls. I mean what kind of body type do you like?”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Ah, so he’s one of those.</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t really have any specific preferences as long as they have good personalities.”</p><p><br></p><p>“How boring! A person’s fetish describes everything about them. You Silas….are also disappointing.” He shouted and I looked at Gojo-san with a questioning look.</p><p><br></p><p>Was there something wrong with his head?</p><p><br></p><p>The guy just smiled and shrugged and the next second, I caught sight of a fist from the corner of my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>I raised my hand and was barely able to block the attack which sent me flying into some boxes on the side of the room.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Megumi -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He winced as he remembered the same thing happening back then. The musclehead didn’t stop there. He rushed to the boxes and picked Silas by the leg and smashed him against the wall and threw him towards the other end of the battlefield before almost teleporting there and punching him in the face, making him crash in the training dummies.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sensei. You said they were new students. That’s a bit too much for newbies.” He told sensei who was still looking at the fight with a smile on his face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hah? Megumi-kun, are you worried about your Kouhai? That’s so adorable.”</p><p><br></p><p>He felt a vein bulge in his head and looked away.</p><p><br></p><p>This whole trip, in fact this whole place was suspicious from the very start.</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, things had hardly been normal since the whole Shibuya incident.</p><p><br></p><p>First they find that Nobara and Nanami-sensei were dead while Gojo-sensei was sealed off and Principal Masamichi was declared a rogue.</p><p><br></p><p>Then the whole incident with the barriers over the country breaking and then Gojo-sensei reappearing and the higher ups….disappearing.</p><p><br></p><p>And after all that, not only Nobara appears, even Nanami-sensei turns out to be alive.</p><p><br></p><p>Nobara had told them about the new students but she was prohibited from telling them about the exact details.</p><p><br></p><p>She however seemed a bit hesitant about all this.</p><p><br></p><p>For this reason, they were all looking forward to this visit a lot to see what kind of students were taken in as the new first years.</p><p><br></p><p>But who would have thought that there would be such a story behind all this?</p><p><br></p><p>Other worlds.</p><p><br></p><p>Students from a different world.</p><p><br></p><p>A literal fucking dragon was serving them noodles.</p><p><br></p><p>Could this day get any weirder….and turns out that it could.</p><p><br></p><p>That kid….Naruto….his Cursed Energy….was unreal….Like it had to be some kind of illusion. There was no way that was real….</p><p><br></p><p>But then again, when he remembered the incident of the barrier breaking over Japan, he reigned his thoughts in.</p><p><br></p><p>Was it related to this place?</p><p><br></p><p>Well, obviously it had to be.</p><p><br></p><p>Was this place some kind of cursed site which released all that cursed energy on being awakened? But that’s not how things worked!</p><p><br></p><p>Megumi was having a hard time processing everything and now this.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, Todo stopped after a while and looked at the debris of the training dummy.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the other two new students.</p><p><br></p><p>Naruto looked a bit worried but it was the girl who gave him dangerous vibes. She was looking at Todo with almost dead eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sensei….I think that's too much. He hasn't even fought back the entire time.” Yuji said, suddenly attracting their attention to them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. I guess that's true. It won't do if he doesn't fight back. Let's fix that.” He nodded and shouted towards the debris. “Silas-kun. In a spar you have to fight back. We are not doing turn by turn fighting like before!”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>The debris moved and the guy got up….almost uninjured.</p><p><br></p><p>He rubbed the side of his face, looking astonished as if not believing it himself.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am sorry. I just got an overall upgrade yesterday and I am not used to my current strength yet. I think I more or less have an idea now.” He apologised.</p><p><br></p><p>Why are you apologising, dude? You were the one getting beaten up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha that’s more like it. Come on!” Todo shouted, excited for the fight.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy drew a knife from the sheath.</p><p><br></p><p>It looked like a….kitchen knife.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is that a cursed tool?” Maki asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, that is….we don’t exactly know. It was originally a sword and when we tried to craft it, its shape changed on its own and took the shape of a knife.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That is a holy sword made by a God to kill dragons.” The dragon girl, Tohru said.</p><p><br></p><p>“A God?!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. That sword was the one God Loki used to attack me. Boss kept it. It probably responded to the wish of the user and changed into the shape they wanted to change it to.”</p><p><br></p><p>They looked back at Silas and he moved the knife. “Chop.”</p><p><br></p><p>Aoi Todo dodged instinctively but….nothing happened.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone looked confused at Silas but he didn’t stop and kept making moves. Todo kept on moving but….absolutely nothing happened no matter how much he attacked…. Until Todo got tired of dodging and tried attacking him.</p><p><br></p><p>In that very instant, his entire body was riddled with cuts and he was thrown into the side of the room.</p><p><br></p><p>“That was!” He looked at Gojo-sensei. “Is he also?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No. He is different. His technique is….far more dangerous than Sukuna’s.” Gojo-sensei smiled looking at Yuji. “He can attack anything he wants to attack and completely bypass anything that he wishes to….absolutely anything. In simple words his attacks only hurt what he wants to hurt and ignore the existence of any kind of defense….even my Limitless Technique. You just cannot defend against it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“....you have got to be kidding me.”</p><p><br></p><p>They thought the fight was completed and Todo lost but the guy got up, rubbing the blood on his wounds. “That was it! Come….let’s fight, Silas!”</p><p><br></p><p>Silas took a stance this time and swung his knife far faster than before.</p><p><br></p><p>Todo suddenly clapped.</p><p><br></p><p>And the next second he was replaced by the debris behind Silas and punched silas from behind.</p><p><br></p><p>Silas reacted faster this time and defended with his knife and was pushed back a few steps. Todo pushed on with his attack, not allowing Silas any chance to attack.</p><p><br></p><p>That guy’s Cursed technique was very troublesome. He was dodging and targeting Silas at the same time. That said, even that was restrained as any and all attacks of Silas were harmless for anyone but Todo.</p><p><br></p><p>They soon noticed something, the more they fought, the less Todo was able to injure him.</p><p><br></p><p>“He knows martial arts.” Maki-senpai said and they looked at the teachers.</p><p><br></p><p>“He’s been learning Martial Arts at the dojo of Naruto’s grandfather for the last two months or so.”</p><p><br></p><p>The fight continued and after almost an hour or so, Silas was actually keeping up with Todo who was continuously attacking from every direction.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmph, if the boss were to use magic, the entire fight would have been over in a second.” The dragon girl complained.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! Magic, you say?” Gojo-sensei asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Boss has recently learned Water and Ice Magic from his friends. He hasn’t used any of it yet.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well….I guess he wants to learn using his innate technique first and that’s why he’s been avoiding using anything else.” Nanami-sensei said.</p><p><br></p><p>The two sides clashed one last time before they separated.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s more like it, Silas!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. I have learned a lot. Let’s get serious now, shall we?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh yeahhhh.”</p><p><br></p><p>Silas swung his knife and Todo moved his hands to clap….only for his hands to get encased in ice all of a sudden. His technique was interrupted and Silas’ attack hit him, making a deep gash on his chest and throwing him against the wall, making him lose consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s match. Silas wins.” Gojo-sensei shouted. “Shoko-chan, please take care of Todo-kun.”</p><p><br></p><p>In that time, Silas had walked back to others and Sakura was checking him for any wounds.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am fine, Sakura. I was just adjusting myself so as to not overdo things. I am still not used to my new strength.” Silas reassured.</p><p><br></p><p>Megumi looked at the man incredulously. He was taking that beating to….learn to hold back?</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmph, boss could have cut apart his soul with that first hit if he wanted to. Obviously he was holding back.” The dragon girl taunted.</p><p><br></p><p>Cut souls?</p><p><br></p><p>Could he really target anything?</p><p><br></p><p>“That magic thing was really amazing.” Yuji said excitedly. “How did you do it?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I….froze the water in the air.” He answered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wow….that’s crazy.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Now finally, the final match. It’s Yuta vs Sakura-chan.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Best of luck, Sakura-chan. Do your best.” Silas wished and she nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes yes. Kick his ass, Sakura-nee-chan.” Naruto cheered and she brushed his head with a smile as she walked to the field.</p><p><br></p><p>The two sides took their places.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. Keep this clean. Start.”</p><p><br></p><p>As soon as the words fell, Yuta-senpai’s cursed spirit appeared in front of him almost instinctively as if to protect him. That <a href=\"https://said….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said….it</a> didn’t move.</p><p><br></p><p>No matter what Yuta-senpai tried, it just didn’t move, completely refusing to listen to his orders.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl on the other side was just staring at them. She hadn’t attacked, or even released the slightest bit of Cursed Energy from the very start.</p><p><br></p><p>“Rika, what’s the matter?” Yuta-senpai asked, confused but seeing no response from her, he turned towards Sakura. “Is this your Cursed technique? Controlling or stopping other Cursed Spirits?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>They all looked at the teachers who didn’t answer anything and were looking at the fight in an unblinking manner.</p><p><br></p><p>“In that case, I will fight by myself.” He drew his sword and dashed towards Sakura to attack but before he could swing his sword, he paused.</p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://No….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">No….it</a> looked like he was frozen.</p><p><br></p><p>Sweat began to form on his face as he dropped his sword and crumbled to his knees, beginning to take heavy breaths.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yuta! What happened?” Maki-senpai shouted but he didn’t respond.</p><p><br></p><p>Then….under the stunned eyes of everyone, even Rika….kneeled, bowing its head in front of Sakura.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, after what seemed like hours but had only been moments, Yuta-senpai spoke very softly. “I give up.”</p><p><br></p><p>At the next instant, Rika disappeared and Yuta-senpai looked as if he could breathe normally again.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s match. Sakura-chan wins.” Gojo-sensei announced and the girl in question bowed politely and walked back behind Silas and checked him for </p><p><br></p><p>“What is going on here? Sensei, what did she do?” Maki-senpai asked, agitatedly.</p><p><br></p><p>It was Nanami-sensei who answered, wiping his sweat.</p><p><br></p><p>“She….overwhelmed him.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?” Yuji asked, confused.</p><p><br></p><p>“What he means is that Yuta was scared out of his mind. Such a thing can happen when you meet someone far stronger than you.” Gojo-sensei clarified.</p><p><br></p><p>“B-b-but that’s impossible. This is Yuta we are talking about.” Maki-senpai refuted.</p><p><br></p><p>“And that’s why he was able to keep his consciousness. Had it been any of you, you would have lost your consciousness or had a stroke.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But sensei, how did she do it? We couldn’t even feel anything. I mean she wasn’t realsing any cursed energy either.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s true but that’s because you all suck at sensing Cursed Energy. Yuta on the other hand is connected with Rika and has an excellent grasp of Cursed Energy sensing. If you don’t understand, you can ask Sukuna about his feelings.” Gojo-sensei smirked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sukuna?”</p><p><br></p><p>Yuji kept quiet for a second, likely communicating with Sukuna, after which he spoke.</p><p><br></p><p>“He is not saying anything. In fact, he is not cursing as usual. He is just quiet.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ahahahaha so he does recognise it too.” Gojo-sensei laughed. “The difference in their levels.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Silas -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>We came back to the shop and I went ahead to take a bath.</p><p><br></p><p>That fight had left my clothes destroyed but it was enlightening.</p><p><br></p><p>I hadn’t been in a fight like this as most of my fights had been over in single hits.</p><p><br></p><p>Todo however was strong and fast. He was able to adapt to my technique with a single look. To be honest, I could have stopped him easily if I used magic but if I did that, it would be hard to learn about my Innate Cursed technique.</p><p><br></p><p>This spar was very necessary because of this reason.</p><p><br></p><p>I did however test out my new technique.</p><p><br></p><p>Sage.</p><p><br></p><p>It was extremely useful.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the course of fighting, I could analyse my opponent’s fighting style completely and predict where he was about to come and attack.</p><p><br></p><p>It was because of this that I was able to react to Todo’s attacks so quickly and then adapt to his fighting style.</p><p><br></p><p>It was still a far cry from Rimuru’s Great Sage but a very welcome addition.</p><p><br></p><p>The skill basically allowed me to think at very fast speeds and increased my rate of learning and understanding.</p><p><br></p><p>Thought Acceleration and Comprehension Boost was always good.</p><p><br></p><p>Not only that, even my healing had become faster.</p><p><br></p><p>The wounds I had received from the fight already seemed a bit lighter.</p><p><br></p><p>I walked down the stairs and heard the students talking happily with each other.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ohh, so you like tall girls. I see. Take this, Sexy Jutsu, tall girl version.” I heard Naruto’s voice and then two shouts of cheering.</p><p><br></p><p>“Y-y-you are my new brother!” I heard Todo’s voice just before loud smacks were heard.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, reaching the Restaurant, I saw Naruto, Todo and Yuji sitting on the ground holding their heads.</p><p><br></p><p>“Stop teaching the kid bad things!” I heard another shout there.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl, Maki, seemed to be fuming while standing behind them while Miu was continuously apologising to the rest.</p><p><br></p><p>I could already guess what had happened here.</p><p><br></p><p>With a sigh, I went towards where Sakura was sitting with Shoko-san.</p><p><br></p><p>Shoko-san checked on me. “Hmm, your wounds are already healing.” She said before observing it a bit more and then looked at Sakura. “Here. This is how we use the Reverse Curse Technique for healing.” With that, she used her technique and I could see my wounds disappear at a visible rate. “At complete mastery, one can even regrow lost limbs and internal organs….even during a fight. A good example of this would be Gojo who continuously uses this technique to heal his brain which gets continuously fried up due to the stress of keeping his Limitless Technique active at all times.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you get it?” She asked when the healing was done.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“What?” I asked, confused.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, this is how the Reverse Cursed Technique is done. You go like this and then change it into this and there, it’s all done.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>I looked towards the others and Gojo-san was laughing while Nanami-sensei just massaged his head.</p><p><br></p><p>“Shoko is a natural at this technique. She….is also very bad at explaining.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh! I am not bad at explaining. It’s just common sense.” She complained. “You guys didn’t get it?” She turned towards us and asked. “Go on and try it.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sakura turned towards me and put her hands up over another cut on my cheek and I felt the sting disappear completely. I touched the place and sure enough, the wound was done.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Sakura, surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>She learned it from that?</p><p><br></p><p>“See, Sakura-chan understood. You all are just dumb.” She scoffed at the rest who were all looking at Sakura, dumbfounded.</p><p><br></p><p>I needed to see it again.</p><p><br></p><p>“Can you do it once more, please?” I asked and she nodded and I went and sat down on one of the chairs and pulled up the sleeves of my shirt, showing them more cuts.</p><p><br></p><p>Sakura sat beside me and proceeded to heal all the injuries on my right hand.</p><p><br></p><p>While she was doing this, I decided to use my last untested skill.</p><p><br></p><p>Chef.</p><p><br></p><p>Analysis.</p><p><br></p><p>I saw her Cursed Energy flow from two sources. One from her brain and the other from her stomach and intertwining together to produce and energy, completely different from any of the sources.</p><p><br></p><p>This energy was then used to heal the wounds.</p><p><br></p><p>Sage helped me understand the process while Sakura was healing me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thanks Sakura. I think I get it now. Let me try once for myself.” I said and controlled my Cursed Energy in the same way. Magic Manipulation helped a bit with it.</p><p><br></p><p>The two energies intertwined together and the new type of energy formed which I then applied on my left hand.</p><p><br></p><p>Sure enough, the wounds were healing slowly. It was regenerating the flesh in my wounds and in just a few seconds, every small cut in my arm was healed.</p><p><br></p><p>I was looking at my arm in wonder when I suddenly realised that the entire place had become quiet so I looked around. Everyone was staring at me dumbfoundedly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you just?” Nanami-sensei asked.</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded. “Yes. It’s actually quite easy once you know what you are doing.” I replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. No it’s not. We all know the theory but it’s very hard to do it in practice. Sakura, I can understand but how did you do it?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, I used my new magic to analyse the whole technique and then copied the flow of Cursed Energy to imitate the process. It worked.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Magic?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s something I got yesterday. It can analyse different phenomena. This is actually the first time I have used it so I didn’t know much about it either.”</p><p><br></p><p>They asked me some more questions and about what exactly I had analysed while giving me their own explanation.</p><p><br></p><p>The basic explanation was that the reverse cursed technique processes negative energy into positive energy by taking two sources of cursed energy and multiplying them by one another. As a result, the energy that destroys becomes energy that creates, and negative energy becomes positive.</p><p><br></p><p>This positive energy is then used for various purposes but most commonly for healing. It is also extremely dangerous when used against Cursed Spirits which are composed entirely of Cursed or Negative Energy. When attacked with Positive Energy, they tend to disintegrate the Cursed Spirits entirely.</p><p><br></p><p>It was however not that easy to use.</p><p><br></p><p>The Multiplication part was extremely hard, even for prodigies like Gojo-san who only got it on the verge of death in a fight. The healing part is also easier if the user heals themselves but they are not able to heal others as efficiently.</p><p><br></p><p>As Nanami-sensei said, Shoko-san really was a natural at this.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have a question.” Miu, who was listening to us, asked from the side.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes?” Shoko-san asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm, you all can heal and even regrow flesh then….umm….why don’t you completely heal….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Maki and Todo?” Shoko-san completed.</p><p><br></p><p>Miu apologised or rather was about to apologise to them but they waved it off.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s because cursed wounds cannot be healed completely. Maki was burned by the flames of a Special Grade Curse and Todo also got the injuries similarly.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah….I am sorry.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Really?” I asked, taken aback.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>I suddenly remembered something and went to my room and came back with the bottle of potion Rimuru had given me. This thing was also very good at healing so I wonder if this will work.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is this? Some kind of drink?” Shoko-san asked.</p><p><br></p><p>I got a cup and poured some in it and then looked at Maki. “This is something my friend gave me. It’s a healing potion.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Like in the RPGs?” Yuji asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Kinda similar. I want to see if this will work for your injuries. Would you like to try?”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at the cup unsurely. “What do I need to do, drink this?”</p><p><br></p><p>“You can drink this or apply this to your wounds. Let’s try applying first and see if it works.” I suggested.</p><p><br></p><p>She took some drops of the potion in her hand and applied it over her burn marks and in front of the surprised eyes of everyone, the wounds started healing.</p><p><br></p><p>Her skin returned to normal.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wow!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Try drinking it.” I suggested.</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded, now confident and drank the entire thing in one gulp.</p><p><br></p><p>The change was instant.</p><p><br></p><p>Her burnt skin was slowly transformed into a healthy one. The change began on her face and then spread to her whole body slowly and in just a few seconds, she was completely healed.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at her hands and then at her reflection and I could see that her eyes were slightly moist.</p><p><br></p><p>Her friends cheered for her.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Aoi but he raised his hand directly. “No! This scar is my mark of honour. Also I think it looks cool.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Good luck with that.” I gave the guy a thumb’s up.</p><p><br></p><p>Nanami-sensei however did use the potion and for the first time I saw the burn marks under the sleeves of his shirts and the side of his body.</p><p><br></p><p>Damn….</p><p><br></p><p>I was reminded again how dangerous this profession was.</p><p><br></p><p>“Say, how much of this potion can you get from your friend?” Shoko-san asked me, taking a look at the potion.</p><p><br></p><p>“That….I don’t know. He just gave me a jug full. I didn’t ask for much as I didn’t have any need for it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Can we talk to this friend of yours? Maybe buy some of this potion from him?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will talk to him and see what he wants.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That would be greatly helpful.”</p><p><br></p><p>The atmosphere was very happy at the moment so we partied after that.</p><p><br></p><p>I found something else during this time.</p><p><br></p><p>“Maki-san.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Call me Maki.” She interrupted.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright then, Maki. I….cannot sense any Cursed Energy from you.” I asked about something which had been confusing me for a long time now.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s because I don’t have any.” She answered with a shrug.</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t have any cursed energy or rather next to none. In fact, I need these glasses to even see spirits.” She then went on to explain about her Clan.</p><p><br></p><p>The Zenin Clan were one of the three biggest clans of Sorcerers in Japan along with the Gojo Clan and the Kamo Clan.</p><p><br></p><p>There was however a very big problem with the family. The Zenin clan values powerful cursed techniques above all else and rejects their own family members if they don't deem their power acceptable.</p><p><br></p><p>Those idiots had even rejected Megumi’s father, Toji Zenin because he was born with no Cursed Energy, even when that guy was the one who had brought Gojo-san, the strongest sorcerer in the world, closest to death.</p><p><br></p><p>Maki also left the clan to become a sorcerer as a way to spite the other members of her clan. The Clan also didn’t back down. They have actively prevented her promotion all this time so she was still a Grade 4 Sorcerer despite being much stronger.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole story left me feeling extremely bad for some reason. I couldn’t understand their thinking at all.</p><p><br></p><p>“Maki.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you mind if I check you and see if I can do something? Even if I can't, I have other friends, I am sure there are others who can. Also, so what if you can’t use Cursed Techniques? You could use other kinds of magic. There are onmyoji as well as other such humans in this world as well. Who knows, maybe normal people can learn such things too. I will try finding out about them.”</p><p><br></p><p>She laughed. “Aren’t you a sweet guy? Alright, here.” She offered me her hand and I took it, using Chef to analyse her body.</p><p><br></p><p>This analysis took far longer than the Reverse Curse Technique analysis.</p><p><br></p><p>Others were attracted by our discussion and stayed on the side, watching without interrupting our work.</p><p><br></p><p>After almost an hour or so, I left her hand and looked at her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you find something?” She asked, with a hint of expectation.</p><p><br></p><p>“Maybe. I….let me explain.” I said and she nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>Shoko-san had somehow arranged for a notebook and a pen and was actually taking notes.</p><p><br></p><p>“You have two kinds of….how should I describe it….chains on you.” I did my best to describe what I could figure out. She looked confused and I continued further</p><p><br></p><p>“One of those is preventing your body from having any Cursed Energy, like literally but instead it is boosting your physical capabilities.”</p><p><br></p><p>A look of realisation came to her face and she nodded. “That’s probably the Heavenly Restriction. It’s an anomaly of sorts.” She explained briefly.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s almost the same.” I said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Almost?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, almost. You see, the second chain….that’s not exactly a Heavenly Restriction or whatever you call it. That one is….a connection or sorts.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Connection?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm and it is due to that connection….that your Heavenly Restriction….is actually weakened.”<br><br>“What!”</p><p><br></p><p>“You cannot use your full power due to that other chain.” I explained and she was left stunned in place.</p><p><br></p><p>At this point Yuji went still for a while after which he raised his hand.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Yuji.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm….he….Sukuna says he knows what’s wrong with her.”</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly all of them were in an alert position.</p><p><br></p><p>“What does it want?” Gojo-san asked casually.</p><p><br></p><p>“He says he wants to see what we do about it. This is the first time he has heard about anyone being able to see what he is seeing in Maki-senpai.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! Curiosity. I see. Why not? Amuse yourself.” Gojo-san shrugged noncommittally.</p><p><br></p><p>“You can’t be serious, Gojo.” Nanami-sensei complained loudly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why? What’s the problem?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“We don’t know….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha don’t worry Nanami-kun. I am….still the strongest.” He smirked, making Nanami-sensei quiet.</p><p><br></p><p>“We would need assurance that his words are true.” Shoko-san interrupted.</p><p><br></p><p>Yuji became quiet for a moment and then nodded. “He is willing to make a binding vow.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do it.”</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next moment, Yuji made a binding vow with Sukuna who then appeared as an extra mouth on the side of his face.</p><p><br></p><p>“The girl is being dragged down by her twin.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Twins are born with connected fates. If one is lazy, the other becomes stagnant. She might not have Cursed Energy….but her twin does….which is also considered to be her own energy and thus the Heavenly Restriction is not being enforced completely….due to a technicality. In fact, her Heavenly Restriction is probably the reason why she has such low cursed energy. It is due to their connection.Hahahaha it’s rarer than those clowns in a circus. Aren’t you all so strong? Let’s see what you can do about that?” He laughed after which Yuji frowned and pushed it back.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s…..”</p><p><br></p><p>Maki looked extremely sad about the whole situation.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t know about the situation between her and her twin but I had my doubts that they were not good.</p><p><br></p><p>“So it’s all that girl’s fault?” Nobara asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Shoko-san looked serious too. “That means, for her to completely gain her power….Mai Zenin….has to die.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Let it go. Thanks for your help today, Silas. But it looks like I just have to work harder to become stronger.” She shook her head.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, if nothing, it’s good research material.” Shoko-san also said.</p><p><br></p><p>“That bastard Sukuna probably knew this and that’s why he told us this, to drive a wedge between us.” Yuji cursed.</p><p><br></p><p>They were all down when I decided to give it a try.</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm….” I started and they all looked at me again. “Maybe….and I make no promises….just maybe….I can do something about it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah, no thanks. Mai not be the best person out there but we don’t kill normal people.” Nobara said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm? Who said anything about killing her?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I think….I might be able to….cut off that connection between Maki and her twin.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s impossible. That’s not just something one can cut. It’s fate.” Maki denied.</p><p><br></p><p>“And? I haven’t tried so how would I know? Let’s see it like this, if I am successful, we win. If not, nothing bad happens and I know my limit.” I shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>After some deliberation, we decided to go through with it.</p><p><br></p><p>I drew my knife once more. This time however, I was using my Chef Skill to imbue the Knife.</p><p><br></p><p>It shone with a bright silver light and changed into the cleaver form as I began to think about what I wanted to do.</p><p><br></p><p>Cut the chain, cut the chain, just cut the damn chain and make her independent.</p><p><br></p><p>I concentrated and waved the knife.</p><p><br></p><p>In the very next second, I felt a large part of my power drain off of me and I fell to my knees.</p><p><br></p><p>Maki on the other hand collapsed too.</p><p><br></p><p>The teachers both ran to check up on us.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am alright, just exhausted. Check on her.” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Shoko-san did just that and verified that she was fine.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, her body seemed to be getting stronger according to Shoko-san.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahahahaha. You really are awesome, Silas-kun. Did you just cut through fate? Oh, I can’t wait to see the look on the faces of those stuck up Zenin.” Gojo-san laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>Maki woke up after some time and looked at herself in amazement.</p><p><br></p><p>She repeatedly thanked me and was about to go out and test her abilities but was stopped by Shoko-san who wanted to monitor her over the entire day to see if there were any other new changes.</p><p><br></p><p>After the party, Nanami-sensei came to Sakura and I. “You have already learned most of the things I could teach you. In fact, with your talents, I would be dragging you back if I were to keep being your teacher. To learn further, you should ask Gojo. He is currently one of the only four Special Grade Sorcerers in the world and would be the best guy to teach you about Domain Expansion.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Domain Expansion?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Domain Expansion is an advanced barrier technique and is considered the pinnacle of Jujutsu sorcery. It constructs the user's innate domain inside a barrier infused with their innate cursed technique. Within a domain expansion, the user's cursed techniques are improved and any that are activated are guaranteed to hit. There are very few people who can use this technique and whoever can do so has their name firmly on the top of the Jujutsu Society. This is the last step you two need to take and Gojo would be the best person to teach you this.”</p><p><br></p><p>We discussed a few more things and even talked to Gojo-san who was very excited about the whole thing.</p><p><br></p><p>He said that he was planning to go on a hunt for some Cursed Spirits and it might take him some time so he decided to teach us before leaving.</p><p><br></p><p>At the party, I got to know them better.</p><p><br></p><p>Yuji was….well he was like Naruto.</p><p><br></p><p>Todo was weird.</p><p><br></p><p>Megumi seemed the sanest one among them all. Actually, Yuta was cool too.</p><p><br></p><p>He was still scared of Sakura however but that eased over the course of the party.</p><p><br></p><p>Panda and the Salmon guy were also cool, although pranksters.</p><p><br></p><p>They all got along well with Naruto.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, when it was time to leave, I gave Shoko-san half the jug of healing potion and despite my repeated denials, she sent over millions of yen to my account.</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t need to mind this, Silas-kun. Shoko would totally swindle the other Sorcerers for far more with this.” Gojo-san laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Goodbye, Silas, Sakura-chan, Naruto. See you guys again soon.” Yuji waved.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes! Let’s meet again, brother.” Todo shook hands with Naruto with tears in his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>….yeah, this guy was weird.</p><p><br></p><p>Megumi nodded towards us and Yuta shook hands with each one of us before leaving.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am looking forward to the next meeting. Thank you for showing me the difference between our strengths, Sakura-san. I will work hard to catch up.”</p><p><br></p><p>Maki also waited beside him and bowed to me. “I….thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled back. “I was just doing what I could. After all, friends help each other, don’t they?”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked taken aback at my reply and then nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>They all went outside and I was about to close the door again when Yuji returned quickly. “Silas, I think I left my purse back there.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said and I looked back at the seat and his purse was indeed there.</p><p><br></p><p>I picked it up and went outside and was about to give it to him when his expression changed completely into that of horror. He moved quickly and put his hand on my face. I felt him forcing something into my mouth and forcing me to eat it.</p><p><br></p><p>As soon as that thing went down my throat, I felt a surge in power.</p><p><br></p><p>It was nothing like the time Rimuru had named me but still quite large. Even with the Sage, it took me a second or so to realise what had happened.</p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://Yuji….no\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Yuji….no</a>, Sukuna….had tried to force his soul in my body….and was eaten.</p><p><br></p><p>It was unbelievable but then I remember that I <em>was</em> a demon and demons <em>did</em> eat souls.</p><p><br></p><p>But I didn’t have enough time to ponder over it as barely a second later, he was smashed in the side of the Restaurant and Sakura had grabbed him with her shadows, her Cursed Energy raging and threatening to swallow everything.</p><p><br></p><p>Tohru was also half transformed, her hands changed into claws, blazing as she was about to punch Yuji’s head into a barbequed meat pulp.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wait!” I shouted, stopping her quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone came running back quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>“What happened here?” Nanami-sensei asked.</p><p><br></p><p>I went to Yuji who looked like he had lost his consciousness. His hand had one finger missing.</p><p><br></p><p>Sakura was still on my side, not moving one bit. She still had Yuji on a chokehold against the wall.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let him go, Sakura and step back Tohru. He….wasn’t in control. It was probably Sukuna.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What! What did Sukuna do?” Nanami-sensei asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“He….well, he force fed me his finger.” I accepted.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you alright? Can you control yourself?” He asked, becoming completely pale at the information.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh….about that….well you see….”</p><p><br></p><p>“What is it, Silas? This is not the time to talk in circles.” He scolded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well you see, Sukuna….he’s gone.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hah?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm….I….think….I ate his soul?”</p><p><br></p><p>“What?” He asked, not understanding what he was hearing.</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm, like you know what I am right?” I asked and he nodded. “I ate or rather….<em>he</em> fed me his finger….his soul and it got digested. He’s gone.”</p><p><br></p><p>Gojo-san removed his blindfold and looked closely at me. “Well, I’ll be damned….hahahaha. The King of Curses….dies by becoming poop. That’s the best end I can imagine for him. I wonder how everyone will react when they find out. Do you think we can use this as an advertisement? We turn Cursed Spirits to poop.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“You are disgusting!” I deadpanned, suddenly feeling sick in the stomach due to his words.</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t say anything and checked on Yuji, confirming that the guy was now truly free of the cursed spirit.</p><p><br></p><p>The teachers didn’t want to say much so Nanami-sensei took the students back to the school while Shoko-san and Gojo-san stayed back and checked up on Yuji and healed him.</p><p><br></p><p>After he woke up, he repeatedly apologised to me but I didn’t blame him.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy had no control over himself at that moment so what could I even say?</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way….you….technically exorcised Sukuna on your own so….maybe you should get certified as a Jujutsu Sorcerer too. Actually, all of you can easily become certified Jujutsu Sorcerers. I will talk to Sensei about this.” Shoko-san said before leaving.</p><p><br></p><p>It was sudden but Nanami-sensei had already taught us about the grades of Jujutsu Sorcerers so we decided to give it a try.</p><p><br></p><p>Anyways, the day ended and I slumped down on my couch.</p><p><br></p><p>That thing actually scared me.</p><p><br></p><p>I know I was strong enough to dodge that or even fend him off but I was not alert enough and he was able to take advantage of that.</p><p><br></p><p>Sakura sat near me the whole time. She seemed like she had been pretty shaken by the incident too.</p><p><br></p><p>Tohru calmed down pretty easily when she realised what had happened. In fact, she had actually laughed at Sukuna and then got annoyed that I didn’t taste her tail but ate that finger.</p><p><br></p><p>….I seriously don’t understand what goes on in that head of hers.</p><p><br></p><p>“I’ll leave for the day, boss.” Tohru said and was about to leave when I suddenly remembered something and stopped her before she could close the door to the Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wait a second, Tohru.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes?”</p><p><br></p><p>I went to the kitchen and packed the leftovers from today’s party and went out and gave it to Tohru. “Here, we got a lot of leftovers today. Have something to eat back at home.”</p><p><br></p><p>She took my hand in hers and laughed. “Hehehehe thank you boss. You are the best.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha don’t butter me up. Get going.” I patted her head and she left while I came back inside and sat with Sakura.</p><p><br></p><p>We were indeed quite late so I got up too. “Let’s rest for today, Sakura.”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked up at me and I saw her eyes were looking a bit like before….on that day.</p><p><br></p><p>I sat down in front of her and took her hand in mine. “I am fine, you know.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But….I could have stopp….”</p><p><br></p><p>“And so could I. I could have stopped him or even broken his skull or frozen him into a popsicle before he could even twitch his finger. But I was caught off guard. Mistakes happen, Sakura. You don’t need to blame yourself for it.” I reassured her.</p><p><br></p><p>“I….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Nothing else….or I will get angry.”</p><p><br></p><p>She became quiet instantly. I let out a sigh and went closer to her and pulled her into a hug.</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t resist either and I caressed her back softly for a few minutes after which I pulled back.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s go. You must be tired too. I know I am.”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded and we retired for the night.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x_________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I woke up to the sound of my alarm the next day and washed up before going down.</p><p><br></p><p>Down there, I was met with an unexpected scene.</p><p><br></p><p>Sakura was already there and she was talking to Lavinia, the girl who had been unconscious for the last two days. She looked like she had recovered, although she was very quiet, almost depressed.</p><p><br></p><p>They noticed my entry and looked at me.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl looked a bit pale due to the incident and not eating anything while she was unconscious.</p><p><br></p><p>“Silas-san, you are up.” Sakura got up but I signalled her to sit down and looked at the other girl.</p><p><br></p><p>“Lavinia, right?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you feeling alright? You are not hurt, are you?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>She shook her head. “Thank you for saving my life. I….caused a lot of trouble for you all. I am extremely sorry for that.” She bowed and apologised.</p><p><br></p><p>“No no. You….had your own problems to deal with. Most of us would have been caught off guard in your situation.”</p><p><br></p><p>Her face fell down at the mention of the incident so I quickly diverted the topic.</p><p><br></p><p>“You must be hungry after so long. I will quickly cook up something good for everyone.”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded. “Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sakura followed me to the kitchen and helped me prepare the food and I whipped up something light for all of us.</p><p><br></p><p>After the meal, her face regained some colour and we talked about various things.</p><p><br></p><p>Lavinia was a magician working for the Grauzaberer Magician Organisation and was here to investigate the trails of another Magician Organisation called the Wizards of Oz, who were….well, all of us had seen how they were….batshit crazy.</p><p><br></p><p>The Wizards of Oz had four castles in the cardinal directions centred around the Emerald Castle in the middle. Each of these places led the organisation and that woman was one of them, Augusta, the Witch of the East and from the blabberings of the woman, we found out that Lavinia’s former mentor was another one of them, Glenda, the Witch of the South.</p><p><br></p><p>Glenda had picked Lavinia up when she was a kid after she had started seeing her NotPokem….I mean Sacred Gear which other normal people couldn’t see and thus thought her to be mad.</p><p><br></p><p>She raised her and then left her at the Grauzaberer Magician Organisation, from where the Wizards of Oz had formerly originated. There Lavinia later found that Glenda was killed by Augusta….or as we know now, it was just a way for her to get rid of her. Glenda just wanted to study her Sacred Gear and sent her away when she was done.</p><p><br></p><p>While she was telling us her story, Tohru had arrived and she too listened to the story quietly.</p><p><br></p><p>Sakura for one was very understanding, having been through a similar….or rather far worse situation.</p><p><br></p><p>I was even feeling guilty asking her to wait till she could sign the magical contract to not reveal all our identities….but she didn’t deny it. In fact, she very calmly accepted it and decided to stay with us till Zeref was back.</p><p><br></p><p>Sakura and Tohru went outside to do some shopping and I was left in the shop with Lavinia and started preparing for the next day.</p><p><br></p><p>During this time, I made some small talk with Lavinia, trying to cheer her up.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly there was a knock on the door of the Restaurant and the door opened, revealing a little girl with white-lavender hair in ponytails and blue eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>She was wearing a white capelet with a fur collar, a pink blouse, a white frilly skirt, and pink doll shoes. Her hair was tied into pigtails, each adorned with three dark blue beads.</p><p><br></p><p>The most prominent things about her though were the two horns and a small tail.</p><p><br></p><p>A Dragon?</p><p><br></p><p>Was she someone related to Tohru?</p><p><br></p><p>I called her in and offered her a seat which she took without any words. She just kept staring at me so I decided to start the conversation myself.</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm, are you here for Tohru? What’s your name?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl just stared at me quietly while Lavinia was looking at her curiously now.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, she took a small breath and opened her mouth. “Break up with Lady Tohru.”</p><p><br></p><p>“....huh?”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Maki Zenin -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She was outside the Kyoto Jujutsu High to check up on Mai.</p><p><br></p><p>Gojo-sensei had accompanied her to this place and so did Shoko-san as she was curious and taking notes to complete her research.</p><p><br></p><p>Last night, they had returned and the first thing which everyone did….was admit Yuji to the hospital. Yeah, the last incident with Sukuna was beyond everyone’s imagination and what came afterwards was even more so.</p><p><br></p><p>Silas….he was a….</p><p><br></p><p>That part had left all of them shocked but soon after, Gojo-sensei as well as the rest had made it clear that he was still a student of the Tokyo Jujutsu High. They calmed down pretty soon though when remembering what the guy had done.</p><p><br></p><p>What came next was exactly this….testing the extent of her new abilities.</p><p><br></p><p>They tested her new physical capabilities and found out that her reflexes, strength, endurance and speed had increased by leaps and bounds.</p><p><br></p><p>Gojo-sensei had compared her current physical capabilities to Toji Zenin’s.</p><p><br></p><p>After this, they decided to check out Mai’s situation as they both were likely connected with the same chain and they wanted to see the changes in her.</p><p><br></p><p>Todo had gone ahead of them.</p><p><br></p><p>After a few minutes, she sensed something and looked in a direction to see Mai coming out with Kasumi Miwa and Todo. Behind them were Utahime Iori and Principal Gakuganji.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, it looks like there has been changes on this side too.” Gojo-sensei whispered as he looked at them.</p><p><br></p><p>Before she could ask anything, they were already there and Gojo-sensei greeted them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Old man Gakuganji, you are looking good. How is the position of the Higher up on the board treating you?” He asked with a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>Maki’s eyes twitched. It wasn’t much of a secret about what had happened with them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why are you here?” He asked directly, not even mentioning that incident.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, didn’t Todo-kun tell you anything?”</p><p><br></p><p>“He said you wanted to meet Mai Zenin.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, not me necessarily. Maki here wanted to meet her little sister and Shoko wanted to check up on her too.”</p><p><br></p><p>They looked at her and she noticed the principal’s eyes widened slightly.</p><p><br></p><p>“How did you do it?” He asked the teachers who just smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ahahahaha it started with me wanting to eat Manju yesterday….” And he started blabbering whatever nonsense he could.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright alright, if you don’t want to tell then so be it. I just wanted to know because of the changes in Mai since yesterday. Come inside, we will talk about it there.”</p><p><br></p><p>They were led inside the campus of Kyoto Jujutsu High and Shoko-san checked up on Mai who was still staring at her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Cursed Energy has increased several times the previous amount and the body is stable. There are no anomalies.” She reported finally and Maki breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, Mai looked at her and spoke. “What did you do?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I….broke the chains.” She answered and left it there. “Now you don’t have to be dragged down by me.”</p><p><br></p><p>It was indeed one of her motivations when she heard that her Heavenly Restriction could be the cause of Mai’s low cursed energy; it gave her the last push she needed to make the final decision.</p><p><br></p><p>“Dragged down? What do you mean dragged down? I wasn’t dragged down by anyone. As if you could even do that. You are….you are….weak!” Mai lashed out.</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t answer and Mai gritted her teeth and left the room angrily and she let out a sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>“That….family reunions are always lovely.” Gojo-sensei smiled and she clenched her fist, wanting to punch him in the face as that wouldn’t do anything for her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Anyways, we are here for something important. Here is a letter of Recommendation from First Grade Sorcerers Nanami Kento and Atsuya Kusakabe for the promotion of Kigisaki Nobara to a Second Grade Sorcerer and Yuji Itadori, Megumi Fushiguro and Maki Zenin into First Grade Sorcerers.” Her head snapped in his direction but he didn’t pay any attention.</p><p><br></p><p>He kept an envelope in front of Principal Gakuganji and then took out another envelope. “And this is a recommendation from First Grade Sorcerer Atsuya Kusakabe, Special Grade Sorcerer Yuta Okotsu and Special Grade Sorcerer Gojo Satoru recommending Naruto Furinji as a Grade Three Sorcerer and Silas Evans and Sakura Matou as First Grade Sorcerers.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm? I haven’t heard these names before.” The Principal picked up the letters and looked at them. “Eight years? You are putting an eight year old in a Grade Three Sorcerer Position?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Old Man….Naruto-kun is my brother. He might be young but he is a man….I will not hear anyone say anything bad about him.” Todo said seriously.</p><p><br></p><p>“And what about the other two? I haven’t even heard of their names.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Mah mah, they are our new students. Don’t worry they can do it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s not the point. They are completely ungraded. How can I put their names for a Grade 1 Sorcerer Promotion directly?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Because it would be a waste to make them go through all that nonsense. Silas and Sakura….they are beyond Grade 1. If you have any doubts you can ask Aoi Todo and I can bring them on later for you to see for yourself.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Silas….he might be a boring guy but he is strong. He defeated me fair and square….while holding back.” Todo interrupted again, “As for Sakura….she….is on a different level completely.” He whispered blankly.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Maki got shivers when she remembered the Cursed Energy she had released when she had incapacitated Yuji.</p><p><br></p><p>That power….</p><p><br></p><p>Todo continued. “She defeated Yuta Okotsu….without making a single attack.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>The Principal tried to say something but no words came out of his mouth and he finally let out a sigh. “Nothing good comes when you show your face here.” He scolded Gojo-sensei. “Sigh….I will see what I can about them.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thanks, old man.” Gojo-sensei gave him a thumbs up.</p><p><br></p><p>Meanwhile Shoko-san and Utahime Iori from Kyoto Jujutsu High.</p><p><br></p><p>“Here….try this.” She passed over a small vial of the potion to Utahime.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you really sure?” Utahime looked at the vial unsurely.</p><p><br></p><p>“Absolutely. We have experimented and it works.”</p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://“Well….no\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">“Well….no</a> loss in trying.” She took some of the blue potion and applied it on her scar and this time Maki got to see it again, with her own eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“....it’s really healed. My scar….it’s gone. Ah, I love you Shoko-chan!” Utahime hugged Shoko-san tightly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes yes. By the way, this potion was from one of the students we are recommending.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! Wait a minute.” Utahime ran to the Principal and spoke. “Principal, I am recommending those students too.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh….did I miss something?”</p><p>________________________________x__________________________________________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><strong>I am back with another chapter of Isekai Restaurant.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Silas had his first spar against a Jujutsu Sorcerer and figured out his new powers.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sakura scared the shit out of everyone.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Naruto gained a brother!</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Maki on the other hand got the most out of the visit.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>While Sukuna….yeah….he became devil poop.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Finally, a new visitor has arrived in the Restaurant.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Chaos will ensue soon enough.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>",

How are you doing?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Fine. Why do you all look so down today?”<br><br></p><p>“Well….” He paused for a moment before sighing. “We got into trouble?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh, trouble? All of you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeahhh….we….kinda went to look for youkai in the old school building last night.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Wait seriously?!” I exclaimed, putting my acting skills out to the maximum.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ahh….I kinda knocked my head and lost consciousness. The same happened to Kiyotsugu and Rikuo had to carry us out. There someone had called the cops who found us getting out of the building and found us there. We were scolded by our parents. It would have been worse if not for Kiyotsugu’s grandfather helping us out.”</p><p><br></p><p>Oh….I guess that evened things out for scaring me so much last night. I hope that the dumbass, Kiyotsugu, will keep his youkai bullshit in control from now on.</p><p><br></p><p>I wonder if Rikuo took care of everything later. I took a peek at the guy who was trying to act normal. Seriously, this guy is trying too hard.</p><p><br></p><p>Although I guess they didn't find out about me or even doubt me.</p><p><br></p><p>I wish I had been able to see him fight.</p><p><br></p><p>I hadn’t seen anyone using magic except my dad and Nobuhiro Kushihashi in this world so I was curious about how onmyoji worked in action.</p><p><br></p><p>But that was too risky.</p><p><br></p><p>“Heh….sounds like you all had quite an adventure yesterday.”</p><p><br></p><p>The guy slumped down on a chair beside me. “Not really. We didn’t even see anything and got scolded by the police. I am done with all this nonsense.”</p><p><br></p><p>Well, would you look at that?</p><p><br></p><p>“Going out in such unsafe places so late at night didn’t sound good to begin with. I am actually surprised that you guys went there after all the talk we had. I thought Kiyotsugu was more or less convinced about the dangers.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh he was….and then he went home and ordered some youkai exterminating blade….from the internet.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Seriously?” I deadpanned.</p><p><br></p><p>“Seriously.” The guy nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh, that was a genuinely spelled blade which had been prepared from specially blessed wood and spelled over eleven months.” Kiyotsugu’s voice came immediately afterwards.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the guy. “A wooden blade?”</p><p><br></p><p>“A magic sword.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh….and how much did that cost you, 100 yen?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Six thousand yen.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Kiyotsugu….do you know the price of a normal….average katana? Not magic one….just the normal old common non magical katana?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hah?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Seven hundred thousand yen.” I replied without giving him any chance to speak. “Do you really think someone will sell you a sword capable of attacking and killing youkai at less than one hundredth of the price?”</p><p><br></p><p>“That….did I get a discount?” The guy held his chin and wondered, making me facepalm.</p><p><br></p><p>“No dummy. You got scammed!”</p><p><br></p><p>“What! That cannot be. I am going to give that seller the worst review.”</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what you are worried about?<br><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t want to waste my brain cells on these idiots.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, after thinking all night yesterday, I thought of a serious problem.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t know how strong the people of this world were.</p><p><br></p><p>Currently, I only had dad and Nobuhiro as a reference.</p><p><br></p><p>They say my dad was strong, one of the strongest in the clan….and yet he could be taken out in an ambush.</p><p><br></p><p>Meanwhile, Nobuhiro Kushihashi was the current host of the Seiryuu. There was a high <a href=\"https://chance….no\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">chance….no</a> screw that, he was absolutely far stronger than he had shown me.</p><p><br></p><p>Dammit. Should I have asked Shuri-san for help?</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>Anonymity is the biggest advantage I have right now.</p><p><br></p><p>I can grow almost unlimitedly as long as I keep working.</p><p><br></p><p>I shouldn’t get impatient.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe I should find a way to increase my training even more? Maybe add some extra subjects which can help me against stronger enemies but more importantly, something to run away?</p><p><br></p><p>I will have to think more about it.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Nurarihyon -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“And you didn’t find any clue of this guy?” He asked, as he took a sip of his tea.</p><p><br></p><p>“No Grandpa. After releasing that attack, the figure….he just disappeared.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We are sorry, Supreme Commander. Due to our negligence, Master Rikuo was about to get hurt….and now we even missed such a figure getting near him.” Tsurara bowed deeply, tears in her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, this girl needed to chill a little bit, which was odd as she was a Yuki-onna. Setsuna was far more easygoing.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah don’t worry. No harm was done. Whoever this guy was didn’t seem like he had any ill intentions. They only made a move to protect the kids. I was just curious about the guy’s identity. Have you met any new people recently, Rikuo?”</p><p><br></p><p>“New people?” Rikuo thought. “No. Not really.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you know who else could have known about you going there?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh….some of my classmates had heard about it when Kiyotsugu was making plans and I had told everyone at the Clan to not go to the old school building or anywhere near it today. Apart from that, it could be people they told. There are honestly too many people.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, that doesn’t leave us with any clues.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Anyways, just pay attention.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Grandpa.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, Supreme Commander.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Tatsuya -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Uwah! Jus-, stop, hey! Uowaaaaah!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha.” I laughed looking at Tobio who was trying his best to move away the golden retriever that was currently licking his face.</p><p><br></p><p>My kid brother has always been a bit afraid of animals but today was special.</p><p><br></p><p>The dog belonged to one of Sae’s relatives who had left it at their home since they will be out for a while.</p><p><br></p><p>Sae had brought it to our place today and Tobio had tried to play with it after some pleading and encouragement from Sae and the result was this scene.</p><p><br></p><p>“We are going to be Junior High Students now. Don’t be so surprised by a dog.” Sae said exasperatedly.</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t seem to be hearing what she was saying so she commanded the dog to step back. “Stop Kinjirou.”</p><p><br></p><p>The dog instantly stepped back showing that it was trained really well.</p><p><br></p><p>My summer vacation had just started, that's why I was here for the next six weeks.</p><p><br></p><p>I went and picked him up and gave him a towel to wipe the saliva off of him.</p><p><br></p><p>“She’s not wrong, Tobi. I understand you’re afraid of animals but if you don’t even try, how will you get over your fear?” I said as he went and washed his face.</p><p><br></p><p>“B-b-but….he’s so big and I….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. Well, how about we solve that problem?” I said looking at grandma. “Can we buy a puppy, grandma?”</p><p><br></p><p>“A puppy?” She asked surprised and then looked at Tobio for a second before smiling slightly. “Yes. I don’t see why not. It will be good practice for Tobi to take care of the little one in the future.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Little one?” I asked, confused.</p><p><br></p><p>“When he has a dog of his own.” She smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Dog and Tobi….hahahaha.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What are you laughing at, Nii-san? I can have a dog too!” Tobi pouted.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahahahaha.” I laughed even louder.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tatsuya-san, that’s rude, you know.” Sae took his side and I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am not making fun of him. Instead, I am laughing because I am happy.” I replied….with as much sincerity as I could fake.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh….really?” She asked, taken aback by my sudden reply.</p><p><br></p><p>“True story.” Then I turned towards Tobio. “Good then. Since you can take care of your own dog, how about we get a puppy today? Know what, I will even make it easy for you. I will take it with me and will only bring it with me on the weekends. How about it?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“O-only on weekends?” He asked, suddenly gaining a lot of courage.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yup.” I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>I had some ideas of my own.</p><p><br></p><p>With my experience last week, I was worried about any danger of the supernatural kind which he might encounter. I wasn’t sure about how to protect him but this dog thing gave me an idea.</p><p><br></p><p>The Naruto world had Ninken.</p><p><br></p><p>And while they didn’t sell living creatures in the Shop yet, I could buy methods of training a Ninken.</p><p><br></p><p>It was basically something which would change a normal dog into a ninken. I would obviously have to train it myself. I will have to look into it more.</p><p><br></p><p>We went to several pet stores before I got the pet I liked.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a silver-white wolfdog puppy, just eight weeks old.</p><p><br></p><p>The little guy was so adorable that even Tobi, who was shit scared of animals, was able to caress its head easily.</p><p><br></p><p>That alone qualified it for being adopted.</p><p><br></p><p>We brought him back home and even Sae found it adorable.</p><p><br></p><p>“What should we name him?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Name? Hmm, yes we need to name him. Then….how about Gin. Since his fur is like silver.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm Gin sounds good.” Tobi said, standing behind me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Gin is nice.” Even Grandma was pleased.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then Gin it is.” I agreed as well.</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s how we got our first pet.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>The same night, I checked about the Potion which turned normal Dogs to Ninken.</p><p><br></p><p>It turns out that I needed to add my blood to the potion for the dog to bond with me. It would also allow it to get used to my chakra and most importantly….enter the Training Room.</p><p><br></p><p>That was the first time I got to take anyone, even if it was only an animal inside the Training Room.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>The answer I came to for my problems was….Fuinjutsu, the most ridiculous thing in the Naruto world.</p><p><br></p><p>It was basically the go to solution for any problem….apart from Hashirama cells.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, learning this thing was not easy.</p><p><br></p><p>Fortunately, I had all the tools and good teachers to help me out.</p><p><br></p><p>While I didn’t have any Uzumakis like Kushina and Mito, I had other Fuinjutsu Masters like Tobirama Senju and Jiraya who could teach me the basics, especially Tobirama.</p><p><br></p><p>Sealing was interesting. Even more so for an artist like me who focused mainly on art.</p><p><br></p><p>The first thing involved in learning sealing was to learn the different languages and practice calligraphy, which was something I was already taught by dad.</p><p><br></p><p>Next was the part about using chakra to mix with the ink when drawing the characters. This part was easy for me due to the intense chakra control training I had been put through.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall, I realised that Fuinjutsu seemed to be perfectly made for me.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next four months, daily Fuinjutsu practice was included in my schedule and I was progressing fast.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe it was due to the Uzumaki bloodline in me? Who knows?</p><p><br></p><p>Other than that, I had finished learning the Sun Breathing steps perfectly due to my Sharingan and increased physique. I was now trying to learn other things from Yoriichi such as the Selfless State.</p><p><br></p><p>This Selfless State was an esoteric and mysterious state of being in which one completely erases their Fighting Spirit, will to fight, bloodlust, anger, hatred, malevolence, drive and animosity.</p><p><br></p><p>It was an insanely difficult technique so much so that I finally decided to buy it from the shop or I wasn’t sure if I could learn it in a few years. That said, even after that, it was difficult for me to maintain the technique for long.</p><p><br></p><p>Currently, Yoriichi was training me to maintain the technique for long periods of time, especially during combat.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t buy the Mangekyo Sharingan upgrade as there was a lot to explore about the Sharingan and Itachi, as my teacher, wouldn’t let me be anything less than perfect.</p><p><br></p><p>Due to constant, borderline suicidal training, my chakra reserves were growing at an insane pace. The three bloodlines worked in tandem to give me an insane rate. Although it was nothing compared to Naruto or Hashirama, these bloodlines were the top of what any normal Senju, Uzumaki or Uchiha could have. I was able to make use of a suicidal method of chakra expansion which would leave normal people dead due to the Training Room.</p><p><br></p><p>Since the teachers summoned by the System knew about the abilities of the System and the Training Room, they made sure to abuse the hell out of it.</p><p><br></p><p>Itachi’s idea about training into complete Chakra Exhaustion worked. In fact, it worked too well. Even Tobirama was impressed by the increase of my chakra reserves.</p><p><br></p><p>With just four months of such training, my Chakra reserves were several times more than before, reaching base Kage level chakra reserves.</p><p><br></p><p>I wonder how that guy would have felt if I told him that his training methods were almost identical to that of an Uchiha?</p><p><br></p><p>Due to all this, my training was progressing quite well.</p><p><br></p><p>My current stats looked pretty good.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Name: Tatsuya Ikuse </strong></p><p><strong>System Rank: D</strong></p><p><strong>Body:(E-35)</strong></p><p><strong>Mind:(E-22)</strong></p><p><strong>Spirit:(E-55)</strong></p><p><strong>Magic:(G-58)</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Points: 1,101,295 </strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Manga: Demon Slayer, One Piece, Naruto</strong></p><p><strong>Features Unlocked: Training Room, Mentor System</strong></p><p><strong>Inventory: Nichirin Blade x 1</strong></p><p><strong>Shop</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Apart from this, I focused these four months on drawing One Piece and I discovered some unexpected things in the shop.</p><p><br></p><p>One of which was the Monkey D. Family’s bloodline.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>They even had bloodlines for these families and the price for these was a lot more than normal Senju, Uzumaki and Uchiha.</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, there had to be something special with the bloodline of these people. I mean how can the bloodline of Garp, Dragon and Luffy be anything normal?</p><p><br></p><p>Apart from this there was also the bloodlines of the Gol D. Family, Figarland family which came from Shanks and the Vinsmoke family.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t bother with the others and concentrated on the Monkey D. Family.</p><p><br></p><p>One million points.</p><p><br></p><p>It was one of the highest priced items in my Shop right now.</p><p><br></p><p>That was the reason I had waited all this time before buying the upgrade.</p><p><br></p><p>I was using up a lot of points due to constantly using the Training Room and Mentor System and thus needed some points in reserve.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, with my gathered points being in the safe zone, I decided to purchase the Monkey D. Family’s Bloodline.</p><p><br></p><p>A red vial appeared in front of me like always and I took a deep breath before gulping it in one go.</p><p><br></p><p>The feeling that came right after was beyond anything from the previous bloodlines.</p><p><br></p><p>My whole body felt warm all over. I could literally hear my muscles tightening and bones creaking as my body changed.</p><p><br></p><p>The feeling lasted for almost fifteen minutes before I was able to gain control of my body once more.</p><p><br></p><p>Looking at myself, I quickly observed the changes in my body.</p><p><br></p><p>A quick thought from me changed the Training Room to manifest a large rock, almost twice my height in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>I clenched my fist and punched the rock directly, no reinforcements, no techniques, pure brute strength.</p><p><br></p><p>Several cracks ran through the entire rock while my fist was slightly red but not even the skin was injured.</p><p><br></p><p>With another thought, the rock was replaced by one several times larger in size, almost the size of a small building.</p><p><br></p><p>This time however I drew my sword.</p><p><br></p><p>Total Concentration Breathing, Sun Breathing, Chakra Reinforcement.</p><p><br></p><p>I clenched my blade tightly and kicked the ground and swung my blade.</p><p><br></p><p>First move, Dance.</p><p><br></p><p>A slash went through the rock and the whole rock was sliced cleanly through the middle.</p><p><br></p><p>Hell yeah.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at my sword and then at the rock.</p><p><br></p><p>And all this was just from gaining the bloodline. There were several things I could learn that would enhance the power.</p><p><br></p><p>One Piece physiques are really broken.</p><p><br></p><p>Even my Chakra seemed to have increased by almost an entire fold, settling comfortably in the Kage level.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Name: Tatsuya Ikuse </strong></p><p><strong>System Rank: D</strong></p><p><strong>Body:(E-75)</strong></p><p><strong>Mind:(E-22)</strong></p><p><strong>Spirit:(E-75)</strong></p><p><strong>Magic:(G-58)</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Points: 101,295 </strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Manga: Demon Slayer, One Piece, Naruto</strong></p><p><strong>Features Unlocked: Training Room, Mentor System</strong></p><p><strong>Inventory: Nichirin Blade x 1</strong></p><p><strong>Shop</strong></p><p><br></p><p>40 Points increase in physique and twenty in Spirit.</p><p><br></p><p>Totally worth a million points.</p><p><br></p><p>All that was left was to train my best. With this, I should have no problem with my base stats.</p><p><br></p><p>I summoned Itachi and sparred with him for a while….and got kicked down again. But this time, I lasted a lot longer than before fainting so it was progress.</p><p><br></p><p>I left the Training Room happy at my progress.</p><p><br></p><p>“Woof!” A silver-white shadow jumped on me and I caught it in my arms.</p><p><br></p><p>Gin licked my face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, did you miss me so much in just a few hours?” I brushed his fur and scratched it near its ears, making the dog wag its tail.</p><p><br></p><p>Feeding it the potion had changed it. Not much of the changes were visible but its intelligence had gone through a massive change.</p><p><br></p><p>It could easily understand my commands and almost the entire human speech. This kind of growth was unbelievable.</p><p><br></p><p>The second part was chakra.</p><p><br></p><p>It had gained chakra and from what I could feel, it had Genin level chakra. It was undergoing training along with me in the Training Rooms.</p><p><br></p><p>Third was its senses. As a ninja dog, its senses had improved drastically, especially its senses of smell.</p><p><br></p><p>I wonder if I could give it the bloodlines of magical animals from manga to further enhance its abilities. Something to think about later.</p><p><br></p><p>For now, it was learning the basics of being a ninken and was taught by Pakkun, Kakashi’s dog.</p><p><br></p><p>I had to buy special food for it from the System to help it grow but it could even eat normal dog food.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright alright, I am sorry for not taking you in with me. I will make it up to you. Let’s go out for a walk after dinner.”</p><p><br></p><p>And we did just that.</p><p><br></p><p>Gin loved taking walks as much as he liked fighting.</p><p><br></p><p>We walked through the nearby streets.</p><p><br></p><p>I needed to buy some snacks.</p><p><br></p><p>Generally Grandma made sure to pack those up in my bags when I came here but my glutton dog liked eating snacks.</p><p><br></p><p>And this time, because I had left it alone outside when I went in to get the new Bloodline, it had eaten all the snacks left in the kitchen as revenge.</p><p><br></p><p>….I needed to punish this brat.</p><p><br></p><p>As we passed by the streets of a relatively less populated area, both of us smelt something.</p><p><br></p><p>Blood.</p><p><br></p><p>Gin looked towards me but I tugged his collar twice to give it a signal to keep walking while I tried sensing the area.</p><p><br></p><p>In an alley covered by trash cans slightly ahead of our position, I felt it.</p><p><br></p><p>Youkai.</p><p><br></p><p>Youkai, this word has become a very frequent part of my life since four months ago after that encounter in the old school building.</p><p><br></p><p>Since I recognised the feeling of their aura and as my training with Yoriichi increased, so did my Extra Sensory Perception Skill. I often tried feeling around me and the results were extremely shocking.</p><p><br></p><p>This entire fucking place was full of youkai.</p><p><br></p><p>They came in every form imaginable.</p><p><br></p><p>The most shocking thing perhaps was the fact that our school had youkai going to classes.</p><p><br></p><p>A youkai going to classes?</p><p><br></p><p>I had thought I was imagining things when I had felt it the first time but on observing the two students I found out some obvious signs that they were not human.</p><p><br></p><p>Tsurara Oikawa and Kurata. Both these people were without a doubt, Youkai.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, in all this time, all they did was attend classes and sometimes watched Rikuo but never once harmed anyone.</p><p><br></p><p>Similarly, even outside school, there were many youkai, blending and living with normal people as humans. All of them lived peacefully with humans and were nothing like the one I had felt that day in the old school building.</p><p><br></p><p>It made me wonder how and what youkai even were.</p><p><br></p><p>However, today was different. This feeling I was getting from that <a href=\"https://alley….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">alley….it</a> was a similar dark feeling as the one I had felt that night.</p><p><br></p><p>Couple that with blood and I was sure that it was dangerous.</p><p><br></p><p>We walked as casually as we could through the area and as we passed the alley from where the smell of blood was coming, I saw it.</p><p><br></p><p>Rat.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a large rat that was eating something….a human.</p><p><br></p><p>It was eating a human!</p><p><br></p><p>I felt a chill run down my spine at the scene but quickly collected myself. Itachi had been far </p><p><br></p><p>Gin saw it too and barked, making the rat pause.</p><p><br></p><p>I gave it a tug on his collar and it stopped but I could see it glaring towards the alley.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is it? I am not going to get you any more snacks.” I pretended to be oblivious and dragged it away.</p><p><br></p><p>While doing so, I tried sensing any more youkai in the area and found nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully, even when we passed through, the rat was too busy eating and didn’t chase after us.</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly ran back to our dorms and locked ourselves in.</p><p><br></p><p>What the fuck was that?</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I was in class, still thinking about yesterday’s incident when I heard a voice.</p><p><br></p><p>“....and by the way, it is said that these fire youkai make up one third of the entire youkai. Do you know what their goal is?” That idiot, Kiyotsugu had been quiet for a few days after that incident but had returned to his usual antics soon after.</p><p><br></p><p>“To invoke fear in the hearts of man.” Came another….feminine voice from behind me.</p><p><br></p><p>It even made me do a takeback.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Kiyotsugu and the rest were surprised by the girl.</p><p><br></p><p>“You seem to know an awful lot about youkai, newbie. What was your name again?” Kiyotsugu asked.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl stood up and replied in a small but calm voice. “My name is Yura Keikain.” </p><p><br></p><p>She was that new transfer student.</p><p><br></p><p>Keikain….that name seems familiar. Where have I heard that before?</p><p><br></p><p>The girl however, unaware of my thoughts, continued. “Just so you know, animals that turn into youkai are the most hostile of them all. Many of them are intelligent but they have no rationality. These traits make them extremely dangerous.”</p><p><br></p><p>The words reminded me of that rat.</p><p><br></p><p>Animals turned into youkai. Was that what it was?</p><p><br></p><p>The entire gang clapped in amazement in front of the new girl, meanwhile Rikuo was looking at the girl incredulously.</p><p><br></p><p>I was sure I had a similar look on my face.</p><p><br></p><p>Was this girl a youkai fanatic too?</p><p><br></p><p>Kana walked up to the girl and spoke. “It seems you have done a lot of research on these youkai, Yura.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, of course. It must be noted that these animal turned youkai will always follow their primal instincts to deceive, curse, attack and devour humans as they please. So you should always make it a point to avoid them at all costs.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Uh….okay.” Kana said, unsurely.</p><p><br></p><p>Meanwhile, Kiyotsugu held her hand and almost sang. “You are fantastic. I have been looking forever for someone just like you.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the guy with a wide open mouth. Don’t tell me….he was going to propose? This guy was too fast.</p><p><br></p><p>And then he broke all those thoughts with a single sentence.</p><p><br></p><p>“You have to join the Kiyojuji Paranormal Patrol, I insist.”</p><p><br></p><p>The Kiyojuji Paranormal Patrol? What in the nine hells was that?</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully, I was not the only one confused and Rikuo asked as well. “What’s the Kiyojuji Paranormal Patrol?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s a group that I recently just started. Our main activity is to search for youkai. Nura, don’t worry, you are already one of our members.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Wha….!” The boy was caught completely off guard but the idiot continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“And naturally the same goes for you, Ienaga and….” He turned behind before I could slip under the desk. “You Ikuse.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t wanna. I am pretty sure you just thought of all that just now.” I retorted, almost instinctively.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s not an option….also don’t fret over the details.” He replied immediately and turned to the new girl before I could argue any further. “And by the way, newbie….uh, I mean Yura. We are going to celebrate the formation of the Kiyojuji Paranormal Patrol. Interested in joining us? I was thinking we should hold the ceremony at Nura’s house.”</p><p><br></p><p>….screw you.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wha….” Poor Rikuo hadn’t even recovered from the first surprise when he was hit by another. “What do you mean by my house?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well….I heard that your house is very….very old….and according to all the rumours I have heard, the neighbours think your place seems to be teeming with youkai.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Teeming with youkai, huh?” The new girl looked to be in thought while Rikuo looked like someone was about to execute him publicly.</p><p><br></p><p>This dumbass.</p><p><br></p><p>As expected, Rikuo jumped in surprise. “No way! I have never heard rumours like that.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No, my information is quite reliable.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yep, it is.” Jiro jumped in support.</p><p><br></p><p>Why was he so excited?</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s settled. Tonight, the Kiyojuji Paranormal Patrol will have its first meeting at Nura’s house.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Wait a second….” The guy tried to protest when Ienaga smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“If that’s the case, then I will go too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Wha….”</p><p><br></p><p>An….I have seen this.</p><p><br></p><p>It’s Sae and Tobi all over again.</p><p><br></p><p>Poor guy.</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t stop and continued. “You know your house does look a lot like a haunted house, Nura. It sounds like it could be a lot of fun.”</p><p><br></p><p>….well, onmyoji houses can have a similar vibe.</p><p><br></p><p>“If what Kana says is true then I will be joining you as well.” The new girl said, as if it was a matter of fact.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I….have to take care of my dog.” I raised my hand and made an excuse.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh not again!”</p><p><br></p><p>“You have a dog?”</p><p><br></p><p>“You could bring your dog along. I don’t think Rikuo would mind. Would you, Rikuo?” Kana asked the poor guy who smiled awkwardly but agreed while I was pulled along.</p><p><br></p><p>Well….let’s see how other onmyoji clans look like.</p><p><br></p><p>________________________________x_____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“Gin! I am back.” I said as soon as I opened the door to my house.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh wow, your house is quite big. Do you stay here alone?” Jiro asked, looking around.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s rented. My family lives in the nearby town and the daily journey would have been too much so I am staying here for Junior High.” I replied as I opened my shoes and went in.</p><p><br></p><p>“So you stay here alone, by yourself?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The housekeepers take care of the chores. Moreover, this apartment has similar people living here. Most of them are working people who are rarely at home or students who stay away from home and prefer more privacy.”</p><p><br></p><p>Just as I completed my words, Gin ran in and jumped at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“There there. I am back.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Woof!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Is this your dog?” They asked, looking at Gin.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Give me some time. I will take a shower and get ready. Make yourself comfortable. Just don’t go to that room.” I pointed towards my studio. “My room is this one.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright!”</p><p><br></p><p>While he waited out, I took Gin aside and explained the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>“We are going to go to someone’s house. That place may be a bit different. Do you understand?”</p><p><br></p><p>It nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. I want you to keep your cool there and behave normally. Ignore everything out of the ordinary until we are back home. Consider it an infiltration mission like Pakkun taught you.”</p><p><br></p><p>It nodded enthusiastically.</p><p><br></p><p>Sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>It was still a kid after all.</p><p><br></p><p>We left the house soon after and met the others on the way, directly going towards Nura’s house.</p><p><br></p><p>It was outside his house that I felt it.</p><p><br></p><p>The entire house was filled with an aura similar to the old school building.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, the old school building was nothing compared to what I was feeling here.</p><p><br></p><p>The aura I was feeling from this place was hundreds of times more.</p><p><br></p><p>Was this really the house of onmyoji?</p><p><br></p><p>As I was lost in thought, the others went in and I had to follow.</p><p><br></p><p>Gin wasn’t calm either so I tugged his collar lightly to break him out of his nervousness.</p><p><br></p><p>The house was an old Japanese style mansion  and it was huge. Rikuo’s family had to be very rich.</p><p><br></p><p>The place was smaller than the Kushihashi Clan but then again, this was just a single house while that place had many houses together.</p><p><br></p><p>Rikuo’s mother greeted us at the door. “Are these your friends, Rikuo? Oh my. It is very rare that we have human visitors here. It is very nice to meet you all.”</p><p><br></p><p>….what?</p><p><br></p><p>Even Kana, Yura and Jiro were surprised and tried to ask but didn’t find a chance as we were pulled in quickly by Rikuo.</p><p><br></p><p>I did observe that his mother was a completely normal human.</p><p><br></p><p>“This house piques my attention. It’s very normal for youkai to live in old mansions like these.” Yura, the new girl said.</p><p><br></p><p>Girl….you have no idea what you are saying.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s like a genuine haunted house.” Kiyotsugu said as he looked around excitedly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes and I am definitely sensing traces of youkai aura from this place.”</p><p><br></p><p>Traces?</p><p><br></p><p>You call this much aura, traces?</p><p><br></p><p>Ah….I am stuck with noobs here.</p><p><br></p><p>“I-i-it’s probably just your imagination.” Rikuo laughed nervously.</p><p><br></p><p>Even now I could feel hundreds of eyes looking at me from several angles.</p><p><br></p><p>Two of them were even familiar ones.</p><p><br></p><p>Tsurara and Kurata from school.</p><p><br></p><p>So they were related to Rikuo. Were they there to protect him somehow?</p><p><br></p><p>“Up there!” The girl suddenly looked at the upper floor balcony of the other wing from where I was feeling stares for a while now.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone turned there but found nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>They ducked.</p><p><br></p><p>They were still there. I could feel it.</p><p><br></p><p>We reached the room and it was eerily silent there.</p><p><br></p><p>Jiro was freaking out but the idiot, Kiyotsugu, was looking like he couldn’t be better.</p><p><br></p><p>“First off, I want to announce the very important results of my youkai research.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You did research?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously. Youkai are divided into many kinds. These include youkai taking on the form of a human being, supernatural beings such as demons, tengu and kappa and even physical manifestation of supernatural phenomena.” he began explaining when the gate opened.</p><p><br></p><p>On the other side was a beautiful woman who looked to be in her twenties. She had long brown hair and wore a kimono and carried a tray with several tea cups.</p><p><br></p><p>A youkai and a strong one at that. She was hiding her aura very well but I could still feel it.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have made some tea for all of you. Please, have some while it’s hot.” She said as she began serving us tea.</p><p><br></p><p>Rikuo looked like his soul would fly out of the window and hurriedly took the tray and quickly pushed her out. “I’ll handle this.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Make yourself at home.” She gave us a smile while leaving.</p><p><br></p><p>As soon as she was gone, Jiro jumped up. “You didn’t say you had such a hot older sister!”</p><p><br></p><p>“You have a sister?” Kana asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“She’s not my sister. She’s just someone….who helps around the house.” The guy awkwardly lied.</p><p><br></p><p>“You know….there is something very strange about this house.” The new girl stood up and said.</p><p><br></p><p>“What….don’t say things like that. I am going to go to the bathroom.” With that Rikuo bailed out.</p><p><br></p><p>“I need to check out this house.” The new girl said and got up again as soon as Rikuo got up.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s a very great idea.” Kiyotsugu joined in.</p><p><br></p><p>Why the fuck am I here? I sighed internally.</p><p><br></p><p>“Have you thought of not doing so?” I asked, sighing externally as well. “We are at someone’s house. It would be impolite to just walk around without their permission.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh Nura wouldn’t mind.” He waved it off and ran off before I could say anything else.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright then, you all go ahead. I will stay here till Rikuo is back….or he would think we have left.” I made up a flimsy excuse but they agreed too and soon left.</p><p><br></p><p>I closed my eyes and took a sip of the tea while wondering what was going on.</p><p><br></p><p>My sensing range wasn’t too high yet but I could feel that Rikuo was nearby and was talking to the figures. </p><p><br></p><p>As I was observing these, the sliding doors opened and Rikuo peeked in. ‘Eh….where are the rest?”</p><p><br></p><p>“They just went out to….explore. I am sorry. I tried to stop them but you know how Kiyotsugu can get when youkai get brought up.”</p><p><br></p><p>The guy sighed. “Let’s go, find them.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded and did just that.</p><p><br></p><p>It took us less than a minute to find the group and explore the house.</p><p><br></p><p>What I observed was that there were youkai in every inch of this house. All shapes and sizes. They hadn’t shown any bloodlust yet. If anything, they became more nervous when anyone was about to spot them. Everyone was continuously hiding from us.</p><p><br></p><p>Yura was continuously trying to find them and she was even going towards the right places meanwhile Rikuo was trying his level best to keep them hidden.</p><p><br></p><p>With these many youkai, it wasn’t even a matter of getting found out. They could easily eliminate anyone by sheer numbers but they never once acted hostile towards us.</p><p><br></p><p>Another thing I observed was that they seemed to be listening to any orders or requests Rikuo made.</p><p><br></p><p>Soon we entered a room filled with large Buddha statues.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wow….you are filthy rich.” Jiro said as he looked around at the statues.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t go forward as I could sense the number of youkai hiding behind them….especially one in the corner who was emanating a hostile aura.</p><p><br></p><p>Before I could say anything, the door opened behind us and a strange old man with an abnormally large head came in. He felt completely human but I would have believed anyone who told me this was a youkai.</p><p><br></p><p>“Grandpa!” Rikuo exclaimed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well hello there.” He smiled at us. “It looks like my grandson has made some good friends. Here, have some candies.” He gave us some candies and I kept them in my pocket.</p><p><br></p><p>Kiyotsugu began to sprout his drivel while the man smiled gently at us. “Why don’t you all make yourself at home.”</p><p><br></p><p>When he left, Jiro smiled awkwardly. “Wow. It’s amazing how much Nura’s grandfather looks like a real youkai.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Wha….he is not. He is just a normal human.” Rikuo denied while I narrowed my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>He wasn’t angry or even offended that the guy called his grandfather a youkai.</p><p><br></p><p>I knew that I would have bashed his face if he said that about my grandmother, no matter if it were true or not….but Rikuo….he didn’t react that way and was instead convincing us….</p><p><br></p><p>“How suspicious. It is said that high ranking youkai can hide their youkai aura from detection.” Yura said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hey, come on. Why don’t we stop looking for youkai and head back to the room.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.” Yura turned to the side where was getting the hostile feeling from.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is there something wrong?” Rikuo asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I feel Iike….we are being watched.” She said, looking at the corner.</p><p><br></p><p>We looked there and out came a….huge rat.</p><p><br></p><p>Kana shouted and fell down, pushing Jiro and Kiyotsugu down while the rat ran away.</p><p><br></p><p>Yura chased after it and so did Rikuo and for once, my curiosity got the best of me and I chased them out to the garden, only to come across a strange scene.</p><p><br></p><p>The rat was cornered so it turned back and growled at us, its hair standing straight as its tail curved as a hook and it increased in size.</p><p><br></p><p>Gin quickly came in front of me and growled at it.</p><p><br></p><p>The rat jumped but soon fell down as Yura threw human shaped paper talismans at it.</p><p><br></p><p>Lightning crackled around the places where the talismans stuck to the rat.</p><p><br></p><p>Yura raised more talismans and spoke. “Keikan Clan onmyoji. I shall wipe out all ayakashi from the face of the earth.”</p><p><br></p><p>The rat jumped at her but she effortlessly dodged it and made a handsign. “Katsu.”</p><p><br></p><p>The rat blasted into ashes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wait! You mean you are an onmyoji!” Rikuo exclaimed.</p><p><br></p><p>Meanwhile, my mind went abuzz with thoughts.</p><p><br></p><p>She….was an onmyoji.</p><p><br></p><p>Then what exactly was Rikuo?</p><p><br></p><p>Because she felt completely normal while Rikuo felt slightly odd. He was almost similar to a normal human that why I had thought he was probably an onmyoji but….</p><p><br></p><p>What the hell was going on here?</p><p><br></p><p>Others came running in at that moment.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did I hear that correctly? You are an onmyoji. I knew it! Youkai and Onmyoji did exist.” Kiyotsugu cheered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I am the heir of the respected Keikain Clan of Onmyoji who hunt for youkai near Kyoto.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well now that you mention it, I think I remember hearing the name Keikain on TV before.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That was probably my grandfather.” She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>It hit me then when I had heard of the name of the Keikain Clan.</p><p><br></p><p>I had heard about it from dad when he was telling me about other onmyoji clans apart from the five Principal Clans.</p><p><br></p><p>The Keikain Clan of onmyoji were among the strongest clans outside the five Principal Clans who were mainly situated in an area near Kyoto.</p><p><br></p><p>So she was from <em>that</em> Keikain Clan.</p><p><br></p><p>“But I don’t get it. Why would someone as famous as you come here?” Kiyotsugu asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Because according to the information, Ukiyo E town was famous for its frequent supernatural occurrences. According to the rumours, the Lord of all Youkai lived in this place.”</p><p><br></p><p>….what the fuck!</p><p><br></p><p>Koji Yoshida, you fucking bastard. You could only find an art school in this fucking place?</p><p><br></p><p>I <em>was</em> right.</p><p><br></p><p>This town <em>was</em> unusual.</p><p><br></p><p>The Lord of all Youkai?<br><br></p><p>“I was sent here by my clan as a test of my skills and training, to seal as many youkai as I can….and then….I can become the head of the Keikain clan, as the top onmyoji of the land.”</p><p><br></p><p>We were led back to the room by Rikuo where everyone was questioning Yura about onmyoji.</p><p><br></p><p>I was listening to them to know more about them.</p><p><br></p><p>It was quite late when we left the place.</p><p><br></p><p>Kiyotsugu and Jiro had to go one way while Kana and Yura had to go the same way as my house so I accompanied them part of the way.</p><p><br></p><p>On the way, I tried asking the girl some questions about the supernatural world.</p><p><br></p><p>“Say Yura, I….well, as you can already say that I am quite afraid of youkai.” I smiled embarrassed while Gin gave me a bored look. “So….what can you tell me about the general areas which I should avoid if I don’t want to encounter any youkai?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm….the Ukiyo E town and Kyoto are both centres of youkai in this country.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Kyoto? But weren’t the Keikain Clan from there?”</p><p><br></p><p>She shook her head. “No. Kyoto is ruled by the princess of youkai, Yasaka. She is a nine tailed fox who keeps her people under control. They live in a separate dimension maintained by her.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Youkai rules….”</p><p><br></p><p>“She also maintains the order and natural balance of energies in the city. We of the Keikian Clan keep a non interference policy with them. The youkai of that place are not as….rowdy as in Ukiyo E town. In Ukiyo E town, the Lord of Pandemonium, Nurarihyon lives. He controls the night parade of a hundred demons and rules over most of the eastern youkai. Apart from that, Shikoku is also under the control of an overlord.” She explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. What can you tell me about some dangerous youkai? For example the ones living here or maybe even the ones who the Keikain Clan has exorcised?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm….there are many.”</p><p><br></p><p>And with that she went on to list the names and characteristics of several youkai. I noted them mentally.</p><p><br></p><p>This was much more than the ones I had known and then she said a name which made me stop in my tracks.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm did something happen?” She asked, surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>“Can you repeat that name again?” I asked, to make sure I was not hearing things.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hagoromo Gitsune. She was a Nine Tailed fox which previously ruled Kyoto. It was dark times. My ancestor, Hidemoto Keikain, the thirteenth head and Nurarihyon defeated her and killed her four hundred years ago. It was after that Princess Yasaka took over Kyoto and calmed down the youkai of that area while Nurarihyon became the Lord of all Youkai. Why? Is there a problem?”</p><p><br></p><p>“....no. No problem at all. I….just seem to have heard of that name somewhere. Where was it….yes. A cult. I think it was the name of a cult.” I pretended to remember.</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded. “The subordinates of Hagoromo Gitsune are still alive and run a cult. They are trying to take control over Kyoto. It is our duty to fend them off and keep dangerous youkai sealed.”</p><p><br></p><p>“....I see. Do you know which area they might live in? I mean….they sound very dangerous and I wouldn’t want to encounter them.” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>She however shook her head. “No. We have no idea.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see….how unfortunate. Anyways, I was just curious….how strong can these youkai get? I mean take Hagoromo Gitsune for example? How strong was she?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Very strong.” She said without any hesitation. “So much so that even my ancestor, someone who was one of the strongest people to have ever been born in the history of our clan had to take the help of a youkai. It was both the greatest achievement as well as the greatest shame of our clan.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Still….can you give me an example on how strong they can be?”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at me and I quickly made an excuse. “Just curious. I have always heard stories about them but I have no idea just how strong they can be.”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked convinced by my words and nodded. “In broader terms, all of the top Youkai are Ultimate Class. Such beings….they can easily destroy cities.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>I clench my fist unconsciously.  “I see.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry. There are onmyoji of that level too.” She said, perhaps noticing the look on my face.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Actually, I remember in my elementary school, there was a girl who said she was from an onmyoji clan. I thought she was just joking. Don’t know if that was true or not.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh. What was her name?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm….something Himejima….I think.”</p><p><br></p><p>A serious look came over her face. “The Himejima Clan is one of the five Principal Clans of exorcists. They are directly blessed by the Shinto Gods and they are without a doubt the strongest Clan of onmyoji in the country. Especially each of the Sacred Beast hosts….any of them would be an Ultimate Class. The Oryuu is the strongest among them.” </p><p><br></p><p>All Ultimate Class….</p><p><br></p><p>“I see….that’s a relief alright.”</p><p><br></p><p>Her face however didn’t look good.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did I say something wrong?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The Principal Clans don’t work with others. In fact, most of them are extremely arrogant and look down on other onmyoji who haven’t been blessed by the Shinto Gods.”</p><p><br></p><p>Oh believe me, I know that better than anyone else.</p><p><br></p><p>We soon reached the place where I had to turn to get to my home so I took my leave. “Thank you for indulging my curiosity. You have enlightened me today and increased my resolve to keep away from all this youkai business. I have to turn at this corner so I will have to part my ways here. See you guys later at school.”</p><p><br></p><p>I parted ways with them and reached home soon, my mind full of thoughts.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Gin knew I was in thought and didn’t disturb me with its usual antics.</p><p><br></p><p>At home, I closed the door and slumped on the couch and Gin snuggled beside me, rubbing its face against my cheeks.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you, buddy.” I scratched behind its ears making him wag its tail happily.</p><p><br></p><p>Ultimate Class….</p><p><br></p><p>“Gin.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Woof!”</p><p><br></p><p>“I want to become an Ultimate Class as soon as possible. Will you….join my training?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Woof woof.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, then don’t complain. We are going to push ourselves even further. By the end of Junior High….I want to become an Ultimate Class.”</p><p><br></p><p>The standards of this world were far beyond my expectations.</p><p><br></p><p>If youkai were this strong then how strong would actual Gods be? Because we know for a fact that there were Gods in this world.</p><p><br></p><p>Country level or who knows maybe even the world destroying level.</p><p><br></p><p>I needed to become strong.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next few hours, I made a rough plan.</p><p><br></p><p>A step by step progress.</p><p><br></p><p>City Destroying Levels would be something like a tailed beast like eight or nine tails or something like the Admirals and above in the One Piece world.</p><p><br></p><p>That was my first goal- to reach that level of power in the next two and half years.</p><p><br></p><p>It would obviously not be easy but I had the help of a System.</p><p><br></p><p>If I couldn’t do it then no one could.</p><p><br></p><p>With that plan, I entered the Training Room once more and summoned a new Mentor.</p><p><br></p><p>The figure appeared in front of my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>White shirt, black cloak and a sabre strapped on his belt. Perhaps the most eye-catching features about the guy were the missing arm, his red, almost crimson hair and the claw mark over his eyes. Yes….I had summoned Redhaired Shanks.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yo….so you are the student huh. You look weak.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Woof!” Gin took offence to the words and got in front of me and barked at the guy who just laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, a feisty one. Good. So, what do you want to learn?” He asked me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Everything.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I want you to teach me everything you know about physical training, Haki and swordsmanship. I don’t care about the method you use but I don’t want you to hold back on me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Heh! Don’t hold back, you say?” He smirked. “You are ten years too young for that, brat.” Just as he finished his words, an incredible pressure descended on me.</p><p><br></p><p>The pressure from Nobuhiro Kushihashi was nothing compared to it.</p><p><br></p><p>Gin was already unconscious.</p><p><br></p><p>I gritted my teeth and tried to stand but found myself on my knees and then even my knees gave up and my face crashed on the ground directly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! You are still conscious. Then let’s take this a step further.” The pressure increased several times more at the next instant.</p><p><br></p><p>I desperately tried to keep my consciousness intact but in the next moment, I lost consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>Although, before I completely lost consciousness, I think I heard him speak. “30% of my Conqueror’s Haki at this age….not bad.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>30%?!</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am back with another chapter of ‘Drawn to Power’.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>As you can already see, this chapter was a bit of a setup so there was not much action in it.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>We are going to get more action later on.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Tatsuya doesn’t know anything about the Dxd world so he is going blind.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>It is one of the reasons why he is making all those erroneous assumptions</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>His situation is one where he doesn’t even know what is what.

Did you wake up?”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded mechanically while my brain was catching up with the events of the previous night.</p><p><br></p><p>The incidents with the Goblin had really affected me a lot more than I was expecting.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you sleep well?” She asked again.</p><p><br></p><p>I did. It was probably the first peaceful nap I have had in a while. It might be due to finally letting my heart out about the whole thing.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s great. Not sleeping well can be very bad for our health. I am glad you are alright now.”</p><p><br></p><p>“…. Thank you.” I sincerely thanked her.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at me slightly surprised before a bring smile dawned on her face. “Oh my. You look really handsome when you smile. You should do that more often.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?” It took me a moment to realise what she meant and my eyes widened.</p><p><br></p><p>I touched my face.</p><p><br></p><p>Was I smiling again?</p><p><br></p><p>________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>The morning went by quickly while I was feeling a lot fresher than before.</p><p><br></p><p>I could smile again.</p><p><br></p><p>Even if it was just barely, I was recovering my ability to show emotions.</p><p><br></p><p>This fact alone made me feel a lot more comfortable.</p><p><br></p><p>By breakfast time, Shiroe had also arrived there.</p><p><br></p><p>He ate his breakfast with us nowadays.</p><p><br></p><p>While eating, he looked at me curiously.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm? Is there something on my face?” I asked, tilting my head.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. You just….feel different somehow.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah….I guess a good sleep does help a lot.” I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>His eyes widened. “You’re smiling.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes….I am.”</p><p><br></p><p>“....that’s great. Glad to have you back.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thanks.”</p><p><br></p><p>We ate our dinner and talked about many things.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are level 25 and Veena is 28, right?” I asked and they nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“In that case, we will get her to level 30 first.” I suggested.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Anyways, we will need to test out other classes for her while the Mage Class is already set for me.” Shiroe agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>I checked my Shingen-ryu and it was level 21.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Shingen-ryu [Unique Skill] [Level 21] [Exp: 11001/21000]</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Shingen-ryu or \"Style That Originates From The Heart\" is a school of Martial Arts in which the practitioner learns hand-to-hand combat as well as the ability to control their aura for combat.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Passively Increases +2 STR +2 END +2 DEX +2 INT +2 WIS per level.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Current Increase: +42 STR, +42 END, +42 INT, +42 WIS</strong></p><p><br></p><p>This skill was seriously broken, at least at this stage.</p><p><br></p><p>This kind of increase was similar to having an extra T2 Class Stats added on my already existing stats.</p><p><br></p><p>Obviously, the advantages will be evened out at higher levels. But at this stage, it’s absurdly broken. And it was not even at full level yet.</p><p><br></p><p>It’s just that it takes too much time to level up as I can only practise it at night.</p><p><br></p><p>My mind went on to the other two rewards I had gotten from the ‘Man of Culture’ Achievement.</p><p><br></p><p>The ability to use Undead Classes while not being an Undead myself and the Goblin Slayer Class.</p><p><br></p><p>All three of these were related to the references I made to get these.</p><p><br></p><p>I should make a list of the references I can think of and test them all one by one.</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, did you guys find anyone following or spying on you?” I asked, remembering the problem.</p><p><br></p><p>“Some people did look from a distance after we bought the hostages from the quest and some did ask me about it but nothing more than that.” Shiroe accepted.</p><p><br></p><p>It had been a week since that day and whoever it was that was following us, didn’t show up after that.</p><p><br></p><p>We had still maintained our usual routine of going out in disguise just to be careful.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. By the way, do you know who among the other players is the highest level, outside our team, that is?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.” He put a hand on his chin and thought for a while. “That must be Gareth and Dwain. They are leaders of two other teams, Azure Blade and Blood Knights. Gareth is a Martial Artist and Dwain is an Archer and each of their team has around six members. That said, the level of their members vary a lot. Three of their members are production classes or those who are probably being raised to become a Scholar and then a Mage. They are still T2. They are recruiting people quickly though so we must also start or we will be left behind.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. By the way, do you have any name for the Guild?” Shiroe asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Name?” I shook my head. “Hmm, let me think.”</p><p><br></p><p>Which one should I do?</p><p><br></p><p>I thought of several things and decided on one of the most iconic ones that I knew.</p><p><br></p><p>“Fairy Tail.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Fairy Tale? Because this world is no less than one?” Shiroe asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. Not tale. A Tail.” I explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do Fairy even have tails?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s the question. Do Fairy have tails? Do they even exist? It’s an eternal mystery. An eternal adventure.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Just that?” He asked sceptically.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well yeah….” I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure. I don’t see why not.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm. Fairies do exist….those annoying bunch. Some of them do have tails too….but why not. This name is good.” Veena said and we looked at her oddly while she just smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Great. Then I will register our guild after our hunt today.” Shiroe agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>We got ready for the daily levelling and went outside as usual only for something odd to happen.</p><p><br></p><p>The gatekeeper at the gate stopped us.</p><p><br></p><p>We looked at him confused. This was the first time such a thing had happened.</p><p><br></p><p>“Excuse me? Is there something wrong?” Shiroe took the lead and questioned.</p><p><br></p><p>The guard nodded. “The City Lord’s scouts have found traces of Goblin settlements merging. It is expected that a Goblin General was born”</p><p><br></p><p>“A Goblin General?”</p><p><br></p><p>“They are high tier 5 Monsters, incredibly strong and smart. They can rival a Lord Knight in terms of power but their most dangerous skill is the ability to lead goblins and other monsters. They can command Goblins of lower tier than themself and control hoards of such goblins. Previously, the largest hoard under a Goblin General was known to be around seventeen thousand goblins and they had destroyed a Mid Level City.”</p><p><br></p><p>A Mid Level City was far bigger than something like Llyne. They had at least one Tier 6 person leading and several Tier 5 ones. Was a T5 monster that dangerous?</p><p><br></p><p>“And now you think the goblin settlements merging is the sign of a Goblin General being born?” Shiroe asked.</p><p><br></p><p>While it was called ‘being born’, it was actually some T4 Goblin Commander evolving into a General but such things were very rare.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s most likely. The City Lord has sent several scouts to different towns and we will be getting an update by this afternoon. Till then, by the orders of the City Lord, no one is allowed to leave the city.” The gatekeeper insisted.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Thank you for telling us everything.” Shiroe pulled out a gold coin and gave it to the man who casually slipped it in his pocket and looked around and then whispered something in his ears.</p><p><br></p><p>I merely raised an eyebrow while he turned around and we left back to head towards our home. He signalled us to wait till we got home.</p><p><br></p><p>“What was that about?” I asked as we reached home.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy brought out a piece of paper, ink and a feather pen. “The gatekeeper said that the City Lord will draft the players to face the Goblin raids. It’s probably a large-scale quest. We need to make preparations in advance. How much funds do we have?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Around twenty eight thousand gold.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I have seven thousand five hundred myself. We need to get as many supplies as we can. It will probably be a city defence type raid. Veena-san, can I ask you to prepare as many attack type consumables as you can? We are going to need tons of them. If somehow my predictions are wrong, we can always sell them to other players so we won’t be suffering any losses. We will also need tons of healing items. Can you tell us what ingredients we are going to need and the prices?”</p><p><br></p><p>Veena nodded and started to make a list.</p><p><br></p><p>“Getting the ingredients will not be a problem but I don’t think I can process so many of them even if I were to work all day. This much would take me working for a week to get everything ready.” She said after completing the list of ingredients.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm….that can be solved. Can we recruit any other Herbalists?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I do know three other Herbalists. One of them is a member of the Blood Knights so that one is probably a no go. I can contact the other two.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I have some acquaintances from the guild too. They are NPCs but I think I can hire them for some gold.” Veena added.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then we discuss the price and get them to work but first we need to buy these items as soon as we can. Others are going to know about the raid soon and they will probably all jump on the chance too. With the demand of the item rising and supply being limited, the prices will rise. We need to be quick on our feet.”</p><p><br></p><p>It was a good thing that we went out hunting very early in the morning to avoid getting tracked. It was a habit we had made since the time we were followed. We had even bought special capes which prevented appraisal type skills under a certain level although the price of those things had made us bleed.</p><p><br></p><p>Most of the players didn’t even wake up at this time so we still had time on our hands.</p><p><br></p><p>We prepared everything and went out as soon as we could.</p><p><br></p><p>First we bought everything we could buy of the ingredients of the healing items and then attack related items. Veena went ahead and went to contact her contacts in the guild while Shiroe went to get in touch with the other two herbalists.</p><p><br></p><p>I in the meantime, went to get our equipment fixed at the blacksmiths and get some extra spares.</p><p><br></p><p>By the time everything was done, it was late in the morning and everyone had found out that we couldn’t leave the town and some among them had figured out that it was related to some quest.</p><p><br></p><p>They were rushing to buy stuff.</p><p><br></p><p>Veena had consigned most of the items to be made by the npc Herbalists while she worked on some herself.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe and I were working on some plans and strategies for the raid. We didn’t have anything concrete as we had no idea what this quest was.</p><p><br></p><p>This changed soon.</p><p><br></p><p>In the afternoon, the City Lord held a gathering in the town square and every player simultaneously got a new quest.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>World Quest - 1</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The Beginning of the End</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>A great danger is opening its eyes as chaos has started to spread all over the continent.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Brace up and fight against the approaching darkness for a chance to survive.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Objective: 1. Attend the City Lord’s Summons.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>There were no rewards and the objective was numbered so that means it was going to be a long quest and we will get our next objective when we reach there.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Shiroe who was done reading too and just looked at me and nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s go.”</p><p><br></p><p>We soon reached the town square and found Veena already there.</p><p><br></p><p>Many players were gathering slowly so we took a place in an empty corner to observe things quietly.</p><p><br></p><p>I took the chance to see everyone and their levels as well as classes and told Shiroe who noted everything hiding behind me. We even made note of some ungrouped players who we could recruit.</p><p><br></p><p>Around an hour later the City Lord, a man in full plate armour with a red cloak came to the stage. He was followed by two other Knights. One seemed to be a Sword Knight while the other seemed to be a Shield Knight or at least they looked like one from what I had seen of the description in the Knight Academy books. As for the City Lord, the man was a Lord Knight. I knew about it already. It was mentioned in the same book.</p><p><br></p><p>“Dear citizens. Today I have called you all here to inform you of a grave danger approaching us. The scouts have found that the goblins in the settlements around the town have started moving. They have suddenly merged into one. This indicates the birth of a Goblin General. It is a being who has the power to reign in those vile cowardly beasts into a force to be reckoned with.” The man continued and everyone looked at him for information.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do not underestimate them as the usual pests you fight. Under a Goblin General’s Command Aura, their power and teamwork is boosted. They will be a far greater challenge than the ones you have found before. Not only that, expect to encounter many higher types of Goblins too. Goblin Shamans, Hobgoblin Warriors, Goblin Riders. It will be a full on war.”</p><p><br></p><p>Murmurs ran throughout the crowd.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have sent requests for assistance but by the time they arrive, it might already be too late. So, my citizens, I request you all to join hands with the guards and help protect the city and the commoners. Rest assured that you will be rewarded handsomely according to the contribution you make. Your first task will be to help fortify the town walls and help the guards arrange everything. After an hour, contact any of the twelve guards in front of the Stage. Each one is responsible for guarding one of the twelve gates of the town. Remember, the number of people at each gate is reserved.”</p><p><br></p><p>As soon as his words ended, a message appeared in front of me and I assume in front of all other players in this place too.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Objective Completed</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>World Quest - 1 Updated</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I opened the Quest and the second objective was updated</p><p><br></p><p> <strong>World Quest - 1</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The Beginning of the End</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>A great danger is opening its eyes as chaos has started to spread all over the continent.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Brace up and fight against the approaching darkness for a chance to survive.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Objective: 1. Attend the City Lord’s Summons.(Completed)</strong></p><p><strong>Objective: 2. Choose a Gate to protect.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s go.” I said and was about to walk but Shiroe put a hand on my shoulder and stopped me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“We need to think about the gate we want to guard. The difficulty will obviously be different at each gate or we wouldn’t have been given this choice and just appointed at a random gate..” He said analysing the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s move to a different place first.” I said and we moved to a room in the nearby inn. Our house was a bit further and we didn’t have time.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe spread out the map of the entire town in front of us.</p><p><br></p><p>“See, these are the twelve gates. The gates one to five are facing the eastern forest and gates nine and twelve are facing the forests from other directions, probably the main places the Goblins will attack. Chasing them in forests will be suicidal. Gates six and ten have an open ground in front of them, making ambushes impossible but it just leaves an empty ground for larger monsters to attack. Gate number seven faces the river and eight faces the mountains from which the river comes down and finally gate eleven faces the farmlands. Seven and Eight will be the safest but we might not get enough contribution points. So, which one should we choose?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The farmlands.” Veena said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?” Shiroe looked at her and I understood.</p><p><br></p><p>“You just said that the farmland had settlements which means there must be people there too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, but they will be given refuge within the town walls. The farmlands will most likely be abandoned.</p><p><br></p><p>“But the livestock will remain. I don’t think they will be allowed to bring everything in. The goblins will not miss the opportunity. They will absolutely focus on that.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, that sounds plausible. So, are we going to use that?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The goblins are moving in large groups so they will need supplies to support such a huge army too. Normally that would be the victims of the war but no one will leave livestock in such a situation. Not to mention the crops growing there.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are we going to save the crops? Because I don’t think that would be possible in such a fight.” Shiroe said.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. We don’t protect anything.” Veena interjected. “Instead, we use the crops to stop the goblins.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh? Wait, you don’t mean….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Shiroe-kun. We burn the crops when the goblins enter the zone, trapping and killing them all.” Veena finished.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, we could also add some oil and other inflammable substances in the farmland to make the fire spread faster, maybe some chilli powder to make the smoke burn their eyes.” I added a few more points.</p><p><br></p><p>“But the fire will spread. It could reach the forests and it would result in a massive forest fire, endangering the city too.” Shiroe quickly interrupted.</p><p><br></p><p>“No it won’t. See, here, at this point.” Veena pointed at a spot on the map. “The river has a dam in this place. It was made to stop the water from flooding the farmlands.”</p><p><br></p><p>“....that….can work. But that would mean we would need to divide into two teams. One will be responsible for taking charge of the farmlands while the other will be responsible for the dam. We need to time it perfectly too or the whole plan will be a dud.” Shiroe concluded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Will destroying the farmlands get us in trouble with the city?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t think so. They wouldn’t be able to save the farmlands either way. We just need to confirm the plan with the Knights. I think your Knight Class will come in handy at this time, Arthas.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Me?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. You are technically a part of the Knights of the City. You may be able to talk to them and arrange for this.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I….see. I will try.”</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s exactly what I did.</p><p><br></p><p>Talking with the Knights helped. One of them, Kenneth, was related to the hostages we had saved and that earned us a lot of advantage.</p><p><br></p><p>For one, the Knights were short handed in this fight and they didn’t have enough soldiers to station at Gate Eleven so he was quite receptive to my plan.</p><p><br></p><p>He took me to the City Lord to discuss the plan.</p><p><br></p><p>I bowed after entering the room where the man was sitting.</p><p><br></p><p>“Rise. What’s the matter, Kenneth?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Milord, this is Arthas, a newly knighted individual and a new member of our Knight Academy. He was also the one who freed the hostages from the north western goblin cave during his test.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, him. Yes, I intended to meet him after this danger was taken care of. After all, it was due to the information from the hostages that I had sent the scouts and discovered the danger to our town. Thank you for your hard work, Arthas. Now, how may I help you both?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sir, I just found out that we plan to spread our soldiers across all the gates.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It is more of a necessity. Apart from the eighth gate, all other gates can and will be attacked by the goblins. The number of enemies is over ten times ours and once they break through the gates, it's over. They will without a doubt surround us and force us to spread our numbers and unfortunately we have no other choice but to dance to their tune.” The man really looked tired and if I didn’t know better, I would have thought he was real.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sir….if I am allowed to speak, I might have a solution to free some soldiers from gates seven, eight and eleven. Not only that, I can take down most of their numbers on gate eleven with only a tenth of the soldiers.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man looked at me and narrowed his eyes and spoke. “If you plan to demonstrate your sense of humour, I would like to point out that it is not the correct time.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I wouldn’t dare joke about such a thing at such dangerous times, Sir.”</p><p><br></p><p>He stared at me for a moment before nodding. “Speak. I will be the judge of whether you jest or not.”</p><p><br></p><p>“May I have the permission to call my teammates in, Sir? Our Strategist would explain things better.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You may.”</p><p><br></p><p>Fifteen minutes later, both Shiroe and Veena were inside the room and we explained the plan to the man.</p><p><br></p><p>“The plan is indeed plausible. Do you have confidence that you can do it with only a dozen people?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, Sir. As long as they are able to follow the plan to the letter, I can assure you that these three gates will be out of the goblin’s reach.”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at Kenneth. “Kenneth, you will be responsible for assisting him in the plan. Choose eight of your best Knights and accompany him and his team members. Bring the rest as you see fit. If the three gates can be freed in this way, the soldiers will be a major help to the other gates. Anything else?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sir, we will need the help of some people and some raw materials to set everything up before the actual fight.” Shiroe quickly asked and went on to explain several ideas.</p><p><br></p><p>“Very well, you can ask Kenneth and he will be responsible for arranging everything. Since this is your plan, you three will be appointed as the guardians of those gates.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you, my Lord.” We bowed before we were escorted out of the room.</p><p><br></p><p>Kenneth led us to meet the guardians of gates seven and eight. He himself was the guardian of gate eleven.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, one of us was assigned to the seventh gate, eighth gate and eleventh gate each…as guardians. No other player was permitted to join the gates.</p><p><br></p><p>At the same time our quest was updated.</p><p><br></p><p> <strong>World Quest - 1</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The Beginning of the End</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>A great danger is opening its eyes as chaos has started to spread all over the continent.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Brace up and fight against the approaching darkness for a chance to survive.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Objective: 1.

Now we need to think about what those things can be.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Probably to defeat the enemies without letting even a single one pass or completely kill the ones coming from our side.” Veena pointed out.</p><p><br></p><p>“That….will take a lot of work.” Shiroe sighed as we walked out.</p><p><br></p><p>I was seriously thankful to be wearing the cape right now. Even the high price didn’t seem like much, seeing the number of eyes and especially the glares thrown our way.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, that went better than I was expecting.” Veena said as we got out of the eyesight of other players and into one of the garrisons reserved for the Knights.</p><p><br></p><p>“Not even close. The real work starts now.”</p><p><br></p><p>Kenneth was given a list of things as well as people he had to arrange and we took this chance to rest.</p><p><br></p><p>The rest of the day is going to be busy and it was doubtful if we could get any chance to rest.</p><p><br></p><p>An hour and half later, we stood in front of two hundred people who had been gathered by Kenneth with several raw materials to prepare the farmlands for the assault.</p><p><br></p><p>The first thing we had done was have them dig several ditches in the farmlands.</p><p><br></p><p>They didn’t have to be too big or even deep for that matter, just around a foot deep and wide and then filled them with wooden spikes.</p><p><br></p><p>Goblins are generally smaller than humans and even this much was enough to trap most of them but what we did was cover them with wooden boards.</p><p><br></p><p>Hay was then widely spread all over the ditches and traps were made quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>There was only so much we could do due to the lack of time but the main thing came after that.</p><p><br></p><p>By the time this was done, it was already past midnight and Veena went in to get the consumables we had ordered.</p><p><br></p><p>Thousands of pouches of paralytic powder and chilli powder were spread under the hay as well as the crops.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact I made sure that I did that personally.</p><p><br></p><p>We were obviously compensated for the items. In fact, we were given more than the standard rate.</p><p><br></p><p>Meanwhile, Shiroe was working on the mountain with several workers to move rocks to facilitate the movement of the water from the dam to the area we wanted.</p><p><br></p><p>With everything handled, we had taken all the bulls and other larger livestock inside, just behind the gates to prepare for the attack.</p><p><br></p><p>All that was left was to wait for the attack to happen.</p><p><br></p><p>Veena used this time to sell the healing items to the <a href=\"https://players….at\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">players….at</a> double the price.</p><p><br></p><p>Due to the reckless buying of raw materials yesterday, the prices of items had increased.</p><p><br></p><p>There weren’t many people with a stock of healing items and many of them wanted but there was not much stock in the town and thus the price of the items increased.</p><p><br></p><p>We were able to make almost three times of our initial cost with only seventy percent of the items sold.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, production classes are incredibly good money makers.</p><p><br></p><p>As we were done, we heard the sound of horns from the Town Walls and ran to our own posts.</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly took the place above Gate number eleven and looked at the scene in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>It was as if a wave of green was approaching us.</p><p><br></p><p>Goblins….</p><p><br></p><p>All those were goblins.</p><p><br></p><p>Just how many were there?</p><p><br></p><p>“It must be around four thousand. Why are there so many of them on this side?!” Kenneth exclaimed.</p><p><br></p><p>The answer was at the back of the army.</p><p><br></p><p>A T5 Monster.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a rare named Monster at that, similar to the Red Wolf and the Boar I had killed.</p><p><br></p><p>Bagbeet.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is that the general?” I asked Kenneth but the man shook his head.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. The General is stronger. That one is a mutated Goblin Chieftain.”</p><p><br></p><p>It was on a cart drawn by T3 Ranked Wolves.</p><p><br></p><p>Behind him were over fifty Goblin Shamans and hundreds of Hobgoblins.</p><p><br></p><p>Those were probably the elite of the army.</p><p><br></p><p>On our side, we had eight Knights, five Mages and a hundred Villagers recruited as Militia equipped with Bows and Arrows. </p><p><br></p><p>I could feel my heart beating faster as the army approached.</p><p><br></p><p>The Goblin Slayer Class was made specifically to kill Goblins.</p><p><br></p><p>The two most defining skills for this Class were Fated Enemy(Goblin) and Sweet Revenge(Goblin).</p><p><br></p><p>Fated Enemy(Goblin) allowed me to gain 50% more damage against Goblins….even in the damage of usable items and that’s what made the Class truly broken. I could see why it was a Class gained from one of the Reference Achievement Rewards.</p><p><br></p><p>The Sweet Revenge(Goblin) Skill on the other hand gave me 25% more experience when killing Goblins…..even with traps. Yes, that was the reason why I made sure to have a hand in all the traps. I don’t know how much exp I will get for participating but I will get something for sure. That’s why, the wave of disgusting beasts approaching us which was no different than the shadow of death for most people, looked like a bunch of free experience points to me.</p><p><br></p><p>I got a message in the Party Chat from Shiroe at this time.</p><p><br></p><p>“Arthas, how does the situation look? How is their power?”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s over 9000!” I replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“What?!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Just joking. It’s around four thousand. We have a named Goblin Chieftain on this side. It’s a T5 Monster.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s….a lot more than we expected. Do you think you will be fine?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Don't worry, I’m the strongest.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>The guy laughed awkwardly on the other end. “Well….if you are that confident.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Just be ready, we will need that plan to work or we are dead meat.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I hope so too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“If I die, I will haunt you to death.” I joked, as my hands trembled as the wave came nearer.</p><p><br></p><p>I had received some notifications but I didn’t check them. I couldn’t.</p><p><br></p><p>The scene in front of me was too much to remove my eyes from.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a sudden change which changed things however.</p><p><br></p><p>“They are slowing down.” Kenneth voiced out the problem. “Are they planning to send the smaller ones to attack first?”</p><p><br></p><p>If they did that, half of their forces would be outside the range of the strongest area of attack.</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>I needed to do something.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mage. Do you have any spells which can transmit my voice over large distances?” I quickly asked.</p><p><br></p><p>One of them nodded quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Quick, open the gates and come with me. Help me transmit my voice.” I shouted as I went down to the gate.</p><p><br></p><p>“Arthas! What are you planning?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Just wait there for me and be ready to close the gates when I say.” I shouted behind my back.</p><p><br></p><p>I stood alone in front of the open gate number eleven and looked at the wave of goblins in the distance.</p><p><br></p><p>“Prepare the spell to transmit my voice.”</p><p><br></p><p>The mage nodded and did so quickly. “It’s ready, Sir.”</p><p><br></p><p>I took a deep breath and shouted.</p><p><br></p><p>“Goblin Chieftain Bagbeet….You're so ugly, you scared the crap out of the toilet.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>There was a period of silence in the whole place. Even the mage who was transmitting my voice was stunned at my action.</p><p><br></p><p>But I didn’t give a fuck.</p><p><br></p><p>If those green ass fuckers stopped there, most of our plans will be ruined and we will be dead.</p><p><br></p><p>So I continued cursing. I used everything I knew to cuss at that green motherfucker at the head of their group.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Game Master -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Bwahahahaha…..” He laughed as the guy cussed at the Goblin Chieftain.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“Which sexual position produces the ugliest children? Ask your mother.”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“Do you wanna lose ten pounds of ugly fat? Cut off your head.”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“You should need a licence to be that ugly.”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“You are so ugly that when your mother gave birth to you, she got fined for littering.”</em></p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahahaha that was hilarious.” Beside him, even Red was rolling on the floor laughing.</p><p><br></p><p>He had gotten the notification that someone had triggered the Man of Culture Achievement….twice within seconds and he had quickly changed the screen to check and lo and behold, his Junior was going to fight an army.</p><p><br></p><p>The scene however changed into this and took them off guard all of a sudden.</p><p><br></p><p>As expected, the Goblin Chieftain got furious and ordered a direct charge of the entire force at full speed.</p><p><br></p><p>Arthas however made an unexpected move. He took the staff from the Mage’s hand and drew his sword, crossing them over his head.</p><p><br></p><p>His eyes widened as he understood what was about to happen.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“You….shall not….passsssssss!”</em> Arthas shouted as he slammed the staff on the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>“SHITTTTT!” He exclaimed.</p><p><br></p><p>“What! What happened?” Red asked, surprised at his sudden outburst.</p><p><br></p><p>“I….forgot to add that reference.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I can’t believe I forgot to add the ‘Lord of the Rings’ reference! Dammit. How could I?”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s not a big deal.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well obviously it is. It’s one of the classics. This was a meme before memes even existed.”</p><p><br></p><p>“....I don’t get it.”</p><p><br></p><p>So he explained it in a language she understood. “If memes were Greek Gods then this was a Titan.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah….”</p><p><br></p><p>It was Tiamat however who gave a solution to his problem.</p><p><br></p><p>“You can add any rewards you want to give him in the Quest Completion Rewards….if he completes the quest that is. If he doesn’t….well it won’t matter, would it?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Yes, that is a good idea.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Great. Now, let’s watch what they are up to.”</p><p><br></p><p>And they did just that.</p><p><br></p><p>The horde of goblins rushed forward with reckless abandon.</p><p><br></p><p>Several Hobgoblins and Goblin raiders, falling into the traps dug on the ground injuring themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t understand why they used the wooden boards to cover the ditches. More goblins would have died if they removed those.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.” He nodded, not understanding their plans.</p><p><br></p><p>He did however notice that the ones who had been hurt by the traps were all poisoned so all those spikes were likely laced with poison.</p><p><br></p><p>It was when the hoard almost reached the gates, the soldiers quickly closed the gates and Arthas rushed to the top of the wall and quickly picked up a bow and arrow.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“Archers, light the arrows!”</em> He commanded as he did the same.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“Take positions!”</em></p><p><br></p><p>Everyone took stances.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“Fire!”</em></p><p><br></p><p>Arrows ripped through the air, falling on the group of charging goblins and taking tens of them down….but most importantly, lighting the hay under their feet on fire.</p><p><br></p><p>The fire spread too quickly for it to have just been simple hay.</p><p><br></p><p>“They used oil with hay.” Red said as she observed closer.</p><p><br></p><p>So that’s why he was taunting them to come forward.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mages, take positions. Use a wind spell. Spread the fire!” He ordered and the mages all began casting spells in tandem, further increasing the speed at which the fire spread.</p><p><br></p><p>The goblins realised that they had fallen into a trap and wanted to retreat but their retreat was slowed by the pits they had dug. The wooden boards had caught fire and were breaking easily when pressure was put on them and more and more goblins were falling into the trap.</p><p><br></p><p>He noticed something else too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Something is wrong with the smoke.”</p><p><br></p><p>A small twitch of his finger and all the information about the smoke appeared.</p><p><br></p><p>Chilli Powder and Paralytic Powder.</p><p><br></p><p>The smoke contained the vapours of both these things. It was making the smaller goblins fall like flies while the eyes and vision of the bigger ones was affected, making them attack those around them in panic.</p><p><br></p><p>The entire battlefield had turned into a chaotic mess.</p><p><br></p><p>Add that to the rain of fiery arrows and spells from the top of the walls and the farmlands had become a place where goblin lives were being reaped.</p><p><br></p><p>The larger goblins ploughed through the hordes of the smaller ones and tried to rush back.</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s when a thundering sound was heard.</p><p><br></p><p>The group looked at the side, towards the mountains where the sound was coming from. The dam which changed the course of the river was blasted and a huge wave of water came rushing from the mountains, right towards the retreating goblins.</p><p><br></p><p>It washed off the goblins which had just come out of the water while effectively trapping the path of retreat of the ones fleeing.</p><p><br></p><p>The attackers on the wall kept firing arrows until they ran out of them.</p><p><br></p><p>When the fire finally died down, the gates were opened and what came out was surprisingly not soldiers but rather the hundreds of cows and bulls who charged directly into the burned down fields, crushing the goblins who had been too injured and incapacitated by the paralytic powder and poison.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, Arthas appeared on the gate, the Knights and the Militia behind him.</p><p><br></p><p>He drew his sword and shouted. “<em>For Lordaeron!</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>The Knights and Militia looked around at him in confusion.</p><p><br></p><p>Ah, they didn’t know Lordaeron.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy seemed to have realised it too and looked awkwardly before raising his sword again. “<em>Justice shall be done!</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>The Knights and Militia all shouted behind him this time as all of them rushed forward to take down the head of the Goblin Chieftain who had been riddled with injuries all this time.</p><p><br></p><p>The torrent of water had downed it before crushing it against the rocks, destroying one of its hands completely.</p><p><br></p><p>“Heh, that was quite well done. And he had the Goblin Slayer Class equipped. He was already the highest level player around that area and with this battle he might have reached far beyond others.” Red commented finally.</p><p><br></p><p>“They did deserve the gains. He was in a party and the other two members also gained a lot of experience. Anyways, I need to decide what reward he should get for….figuring out a glitch in the game. Yes. A glitch.”</p><p><br></p><p>“…. Are you really that bothered with the reference thing?”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Arthas -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I fell on my backside when the gate finally closed shut after we had retreated after clearing out the leftovers.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe and Veena had already messaged me that the fight on their side had been taken care of too.</p><p><br></p><p>There were only a few hundred goblins on their side and they had easily been taken care of by the militia.</p><p><br></p><p>So they were coming here right now.</p><p><br></p><p>I took this chance to look at my Status.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha….” I couldn’t help but burst out into a loud laugh.</p><p><br></p><p>The others looked at me and they chuckled and then started laughing. Although all of us were laughing for different reasons.</p><p><br></p><p>They were laughing because they had just escaped with their life and overturned the entire pace of the war, taking the win against an army over twenty times their size.</p><p><br></p><p>I was laughing at my level.</p><p><br></p><p>Level 38.</p><p><br></p><p>I was level 3 when this fight had started.</p><p><br></p><p>35 levels in one fight.</p><p><br></p><p>I couldn’t do anything else than laugh my heart out.</p><p><br></p><p>But that was not all.</p><p><br></p><p>I scrolled through the notifications and reached back to the reference rewards.</p><p><br></p><p>The one for the Dragon ball reference was a unique skill.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Congratulations Traveller.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>You have discovered another secret!</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Reward: Unique Skill: Scouter</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Keep working hard.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Traveller.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>A Special Title given to those who complete the Hidden Quests, Man of Culture.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>+4 to all stats.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>+8% to Exp Gained.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Note: The Effect of the Title can be enhanced the more secrets the Traveller discovers in the world.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The Skill allowed me to see the information and stats of other people, three Tiers above me unless they specifically had Skills or high Ranked items to obscure them.</p><p><br></p><p>It really was a scouter.</p><p><br></p><p>It couldn’t be levelled up either.</p><p><br></p><p>The one for the JJK reference was another skill.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Congratulations Traveller.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>You have discovered another secret!</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Reward: Unique Skill: Limitless</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Keep working hard.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Traveller.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>A Special Title given to those who complete the Hidden Quests, Man of Culture.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>+5 to all stats.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>+10% to Exp Gained.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Note: The Effect of the Title can be enhanced the more secrets the Traveller discovers in the world.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>As much as I wished it was actually the Limitless <a href=\"https://Skill….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Skill….it</a> wasn’t.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Limitless [Unique Skill] [Level 1] [Exp: 0/1000]</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Divides the Space between you and an incoming attack infinite times to slow down and stop any incoming attacks.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Skill Duration:10 Seconds</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Cooldown: Two Hours</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Cooldown is reduced by one minute for every level.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>With a total of one hundred levels, this Skill could allow me to spam it every twenty minutes at max level and stop any kind of attack.</p><p><br></p><p>Damn, that’s OP.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a perfect Skill for me who was at the lead as a tank for the team.

I had tried many others previously and had not received anything from them either.</p><p><br></p><p>Apart from that, there were tons of drop items that I had from the whole thing.</p><p><br></p><p>Very soon, Shiroe and Veena appeared from their own posts.</p><p><br></p><p>“Arthas. Are you alright? Has everything ended?” Veena asked as she reached me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. More than alright.”</p><p><br></p><p>These two had gained a lot too.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe had received the Mage Class already and was a level 15 Mage while Veena had also completed the Herbalist Class was also maxed out and she was now a level 18 Pharmacist.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t know how other teams and players did in the fight but I doubt it would be this good.</p><p><br></p><p>“Should we go check out the other gates?” I asked but Shiroe shook his head.</p><p><br></p><p>“Won’t work. We had to choose the Gates we wanted to protect. I doubt they would put that in if we could just run around to other gates.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The line of command in such situations is very harsh. You cannot intrude in other people’s positions without their permission.” Veena said too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright.” I nodded. “By the way, you chose the Pharmacist Class?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I had to use the experience somewhere and we need someone to prepare the consumables either way. Our fighting style is deeply dependent on this so I chose to use this Class.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t mind, dear. I can always get other Classes later on.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded and looked at Shiroe. “How is the Mage Class?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Amazing. The fire power is far better than Scholar. There is a thing about learning better skills through Skill Books and outer sources but hey, the best things need us to work for it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So true.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What about you though? You are almost at level Cap. Guess the Goblin Slayer Class in a Goblin raid was just too broken. I doubt we would have received so much experience if it hadn’t been for your Sweet Revenge Skill.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah. I didn’t expect it either.”</p><p><br></p><p>The fight at the other gates continued for several more hours.</p><p><br></p><p>We returned to our gates and waited for any more goblins who may attack but there were none.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, at the end of the day, reinforcements arrived.</p><p><br></p><p>An entire cavalry of two thousand Knights marched from the main roads and cleared up any remaining enemies.</p><p><br></p><p>All of them were at the very least Tier 4 while the stronger ones were Tier 5 and the leader was a Tier 6, the highest Tier I had seen yet.</p><p><br></p><p>Thanks to my newly acquired Scouter Skill, I got the information about the Class of the guy.</p><p><br></p><p>Holy Knight.</p><p><br></p><p>At least that was a clue.</p><p><br></p><p>We were all given the day off to retire and take rest.</p><p><br></p><p>The City Lord announced that the town was finally safe and all the attacking goblins had been taken care of. There will be a ceremony for rewarding the ones who had participated in resisting the attack after they took care of everything.</p><p><br></p><p>Till then, we were told to rest and not leave the town as the Knight battalion which had arrived was scouring through the forests and cleaning up any and every goblin settlement in the nearby area.</p><p><br></p><p>We had been awake for over twenty four hours at that point and while my new fitness could easily allow me to be awake for three days or so, I was too mentally exhausted so we separated and left for our home too.</p><p><br></p><p>This mission had changed a lot of things.</p><p><br></p><p>Our identities were barely a secret at this point. It just hadn’t spread throughout the town yet but even then I had observed many people trying to observe us from a distance.</p><p><br></p><p>They didn’t approach us in the town though.</p><p><br></p><p>As we entered the house, I quickly closed the door behind me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Those stares are indeed getting annoying.” Veena said as she removed her equipment and set it aside.</p><p><br></p><p>Our equipment was covered with blood and grime and while Veena was relatively <a href=\"https://clean….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">clean….it</a> was still very dirty.</p><p><br></p><p>“It will get even worse after the Award Ceremony as they would probably reveal the rewards. Maybe….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Maybe we should think about changing town.” I said hesitantly.</p><p><br></p><p>“And how would that change anything? Instead it would get in the way of making a guild. Most of the players are Tier 3 right now and I doubt anyone else apart from us is Tier 4. They will probably stay here till they reach the level cap for Tier 4. If we want to recruit members, we can only hire from them here. If we go to a higher level town, we won’t see any players there for months. That would set back the creation of our guild by months. Not to mention, most of the people would already be part of other guilds.” She explained.</p><p><br></p><p>And she was not wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>She came to me and caressed my hair lightly. “Don’t worry about the stares. As long as you are strong, you can take care of those kinds of stares easily. I believe that even with my current stats, I could take down at least two Tier 3 attackers easily.”</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s when she has been using a production class all along.</p><p><br></p><p>She walked to her room and came out after a minute, dressed in just a towel.</p><p><br></p><p>The scene from yesterday morning came flashing in my mind.</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly shook my head and removed my own equipment and cleaned them first. Plate Armour needed a lot of maintenance.</p><p><br></p><p>She came out of the bath in the same towel, although her wet hair made her look even better.</p><p><br></p><p>I shook off the thoughts and went to the bath quickly to cool myself down.</p><p><br></p><p>My thoughts were drifting a lot. Need to control that.</p><p><br></p><p>While I took a bath, she prepared something quick to eat. Although extremely tired, none of us wanted to go out to eat right now.</p><p><br>Finally, when it was time to sleep, I was about to go to my room when I heard her voice.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my, did you not enjoy your nap the day before?” She smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah….it’s not like that….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then come and join me.” She said and didn’t give me any time to say anything as she dragged me by my hand to the bed.</p><p><br></p><p>Well….who was I to say no to such an invitation?</p><p><br></p><p>________________________________x__________________________________________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am back with another chapter of ‘Soul Art Online’.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Arthas and the team took part in the first World Quest.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The quests will start branching off and become more rpg-like than just hunting and levelling from now on.

Moreover this training also helped increase my training, concentration, dexterity, strength and stamina.</p><p><br></p><p>All this helped me create manga much faster so it was actually a loop.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly, I got a notification.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Upgrade Quest Completed: I am here</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Became a known name in the Manga World</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sell Two hundred Thousand copies of your manga.

It was a familiar figure.</p><p><br></p><p>Sae Toujou was a neighbour and the daughter of a family friend of the Ikuse family.</p><p><br></p><p>She was the same age as Tobio and was very good friends with him.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, I think my little brother had a crush on the girl.</p><p><br></p><p>It was so much fun to tease them.</p><p><br></p><p>They were sitting at the dinner table, eating.</p><p><br></p><p>“I’m back.” I shouted before joining them. “Oh, sandwiches, awesome. I’m starving.” I really was.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wash your hands first, Tatsu.” Grandma said and I quickly did just that before taking a seat at the dinner table.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! These are very good.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Right. Sai-chan made these.” Grandma said, throwing a smile at the blushing girl.</p><p><br></p><p>I caught the signal Grandma had sent my way and a smirk appeared at the corner of my lips.</p><p><br></p><p>“Really! That’s awesome, Sae-chan. I wish I could eat your cooking everyday. Alright… it’s decided. You can marry Tobi when you’re older. Then I can eat all the sandwiches I want. How is my idea, Grandma?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my! That does sound amazing. After all, I am growing old too. I wouldn’t mind seeing a few great grandkids before I pass away.”</p><p><br></p><p>The girl’s blush was atomic while Tobi’s chopsticks fell from his hands and his mouth was still open.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wha… what are you both talking about?!”</p><p><br></p><p>“What? You don’t want to marry Sae-chan? In that case I wouldn’t mind.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I didn’t sa… I mean stop embarrassing her, Nii-san!”</p><p><br></p><p>I couldn’t hold it in seeing his flustered look and the slip of tongue and burst out laughing. Grandma chuckled too and the two understood we were pulling their legs.</p><p><br></p><p>The atmosphere was very harmonious.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“Here’s the chapter for this week.” I handed the chapter to Koji-san. “Do you have any suggestions?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. Let me check. Everyone was hyped up for this chapter. You left everyone hanging with the Akaza vs Rengoku fight. The ratings for Kimetsu no Yaiba are through the roof….” He spoke as he read the chapter. Suddenly his words stopped. “Tatsuya-kun… this is not what I think it is, right?”</p><p><br></p><p>“About Rengoku?” I asked, without turning back and continuing to work on the next chapter.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes… about Rengoku. Did you read the Character Popularity Polls I had given you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, not really.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well you should. This guy was one of the top ten most liked characters in your manga.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh… that’s sad, I guess.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Maybe you should change it. If you want him out of the plot, there are several ways to do so. Have him be in a comatose state or lose his ability to fight… or….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Koji-san.” I interrupted.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“People die.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>He was going to say something but I didn’t give him a chance.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good people too.”</p><p><br></p><p>Whatever he was about to say was swallowed back.</p><p><br></p><p>I let out a sigh. “Don’t worry. His death will not be in vain. It is necessary for the plot. If there are people complaining, ask them to send questions. I will select a few and answer some of them if I can.” I offered a compromise here.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. I will.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Great. Now I have heard that your grandmother was talking about attending a school with a good art program. Unfortunately there are no Junior High Schools nearby which can do so. There is the Ryoukuu High School nearby which has a good art program and a budding manga club. That said, a little distance away in Ukiyo E town in Tokyo, there is the Sobo Junior High which has a very good art program. You can join it if you want.” He advised.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. I will talk to grandma and inform you. How far is it?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It will take you around an hour and half minutes or so each day by bus, although if you want, I could get you a car and a driver.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No. I am just an ordinary Middle School student, Koji-san. I don’t want too much attention on me. I will take the train.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. As you wish. By the way, we are expecting a reprint of the seventh volume of Kimetsu no Yaiba. Congratulations. At this rate, you will be reaching half a million copies soon. Selling half a million before entering Junior High… seriously, you are something else. I am sure Hiroshi-senpai would have been proud. Knowing him, he would be bragging to everyone he could.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>I looked down at the table quietly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t be sad, Tatsu-kun. Today is, after all, your birthday. Cheer up.”</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. It was my birthday.</p><p><br></p><p>A year had passed since Kimetsu no Yaiba became a weekly at Shounen Jump and nine months since I got the One Piece and Naruto Manga.</p><p><br></p><p>I had spent a majority of these nine months drawing Naruto and One Piece. As for Demon Slayers, I had over 100 unpublished chapters and only 20 or so chapters before completion.</p><p><br></p><p>After Koji-san left, I decided to take a break.</p><p><br></p><p>Shuri-san and Akeno had come to our home to celebrate my birthday. They were out to take Grandma to get some check ups done and then do the shopping for tonight’s party.</p><p><br></p><p>Tobi had gone with them too and I was left alone because Koji-san was coming to meet me so right now, there was no one else in the house.</p><p><br></p><p>All of them will be back by evening.</p><p><br></p><p>I had several hours in my hand so I decided to get some training done.</p><p><br></p><p>I entered the Training Room.</p><p><br></p><p>Status.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Name: Tatsuya Ikuse </strong></p><p><strong>System Rank: D</strong></p><p><strong>Body:(F-81)</strong></p><p><strong>Mind:(F-56)</strong></p><p><strong>Spirit:(F-28)</strong></p><p><strong>Magic:(G-28)</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Points: 1,280,598 </strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Manga: Demon Slayer, One Piece, Naruto</strong></p><p><strong>Features Unlocked: Training Room, Mentor System</strong></p><p><strong>Inventory: Nichirin Blade x 1, </strong></p><p><strong>Shop</strong></p><p><br><br></p><p>The Mentor System was a very amazing feature that I had unlocked in the last upgrade.</p><p><br></p><p>It basically allowed me to summon any character from the chapters I had drawn and had read by at least one other person.</p><p><br></p><p>They would teach me anything I wanted to learn from them. Although whether I could learn from them or not depends totally on me.</p><p><br></p><p>That means I couldn’t learn something like say, the Sharingan Genjutsu if I had no Sharingan. I would need to buy them first.</p><p><br></p><p>Also the speed of learning was totally based on my own talent. So I could learn something far more easily than the characters of the manga or I might not be able to learn anything at all.</p><p><br></p><p>The price of using the Mentor System for one day was ten thousand points and only one teacher per day.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a bit expensive but having a teacher does help a lot. I mean there were many things I couldn’t just buy from the System Shop.</p><p><br></p><p>I summoned the teacher I wanted for today.</p><p><br></p><p>Ten thousand points were deducted from my System as a figure manifested before my eyes. He had tan-skin and had grey hair, and a small goatee.</p><p><br></p><p>Hiruzen Sarutobi.</p><p><br></p><p>I had summoned him to teach me the basics of chakra use and control.</p><p><br></p><p>He was not the only teacher I learned from. Sometimes I summon Yoriichi Tsugikuni to learn Sun Breathing and swordsmanship.</p><p><br></p><p>As for Sarutobi, I could take as many exercises from him as I needed and then master it over time on my own.</p><p><br></p><p>I wanted to push myself till I was able to make at least one Shadow Clone first.</p><p><br></p><p>Chakra training was actually a bit easier due to my experience with Total Concentration Breathing which involved both meditation and physical strengthening.</p><p><br></p><p>I had chakra reserves of a Genin with just three months of training. I wished to train to control my chakra a bit before I bought the Uzumaki Bloodline or maybe Senju Bloodline to bolster my chakra reserves even more.</p><p><br></p><p>Sarutobi had tons of basics of fighting and survival tips to teach me.</p><p><br></p><p>This guy was without any special bloodline or without any special technique and yet managed to become such a strong Shinobi, it was due to his hard work and talent.</p><p><br></p><p>Moreover, he was an extremely great teacher.</p><p><br></p><p>He not only taught me about Chakra and Chakra Control, but also Taijutsu and bits of Ninjutsu.</p><p><br></p><p>I am planning to get a Sharingan to learn faster from him.</p><p><br></p><p>The Naruto world had too many things to get. The only problem I was having right now was points. The D Rank stuff is priced in the hundreds of thousands.</p><p><br></p><p>I needed to get one more manga published to get more points.</p><p><br></p><p>I guess I would have to ask Koji-san after I complete more chapters of Naruto.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“Happy Birthday!”</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone wished me a happy birthday while I cut the cake. There weren’t many people present.</p><p><br></p><p>Grandma, Tobi, Shuri-san and Akeno, Sae and her parents and Koji-san.</p><p><br></p><p>“A very happy birthday to you, Tatsu-kun.” Shuri-san greeted me and gave me a haori.</p><p><br></p><p>“Happy Birthday, Onii-chan.” Behind her Akeno held up what looked like a good luck charm as my birthday gift.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you make it yourself?” I asked and she nodded. “That’s awesome. Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>Grandma and Tobi got me a bicycle.</p><p><br></p><p>When it was Koji-san’s turn, he gave me a new professional manga drawing kit.</p><p><br></p><p>“Koji-san.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Can I ask you for something?” I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh? Ask me? Sure, go on.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hold here a minute.” I ran to my room and brought out the Naruto One Shot and handed it to him.</p><p><br></p><p>“What’s this?” He took it with a raised eyebrow.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nii-san, is that?” Tobi began to speak but I signalled him to stop. He was the one who read all my manga so that I could unlock the new items in the System Shop.</p><p><br></p><p>Koji-san took the file, unsure and opened it.</p><p><br></p><p>“Naruto. You made another manga?”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded and he took a look.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is… really good.” He said as he continued reading.</p><p><br></p><p>“Right, right?”</p><p><br></p><p> Finally setting the file aside, he crossed his arms. “So you want to have this published.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“The Chief.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I have over one hundred advanced chapters of Kimetsu no Yaiba, which is already near completion and thirty chapters of this one completed. Also, have I ever missed out on the deadline?” Actually I had over fifty of Naruto and One Piece but I was not going to tell him that.</p><p><br></p><p>He let out a sigh. “It’s not about that. You are very talented, Tatsu-kun. None of us wants you to overwork yourself. Moreover, don’t you have classes? What if you lag behind in your studies.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Nii-san is very smart, you know. He is at the top of his class.” Tobi chimed in from my side. “He even helps me with my studies.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man looked at me, surprised. “Seriously?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Actually, I am at the top of my entire year.” I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>He just stared at me dumbfoundedly for a minute and then let out a sigh. “I will talk to the chief.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yay!” Tobi cheered and I smiled too.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally.</p><p><br></p><p>The rest of the party was amazing.</p><p><br></p><p>I was mostly happy that I could get another manga for publishing.</p><p><br></p><p>________________________________x_____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the children bustling around me. Everyone was excited to be in the new school, among new people. Some not too much.</p><p><br></p><p>I agreed to come to an arts focused school so that I could improve my drawing skills and this school had good art clubs who participated in several competitions and had great records.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t exactly need it but Grandma said that I should always try to learn new things and it didn’t exactly hurt trying. Koji-san was also very insistent and both of them pushed me here.</p><p><br></p><p>The main reason I agreed was because I could stay at a private dorm here. The journey wasted a lot of time in which I could work so after some consultations, I agreed to stay in the dorms.</p><p><br></p><p>Here, they provided food and lodging and separate rooms for each student. Obviously it was very expensive but money was not an issue for me.</p><p><br></p><p>Mom and Dad had left me a sizable inheritance, not to mention my own earnings. I never had any shortages of money.</p><p><br></p><p>I took this so that I could concentrate more on my training.</p><p><br></p><p>Tobi however was quite sad so I promised him to return home on the weekends.</p><p><br></p><p>“... that’s because we are going to have a quiz about youkai.”</p><p><br></p><p>A sudden comment drew my attention and I looked at the speaker.</p><p><br></p><p>Kiyotsugu, the School Council President.</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah, a school president in the first year was a surprise but not so much when you know what his family does.</p><p><br></p><p>His father is a big businessman and one of the major shareholders of the school as well as a member of the school board. The same goes for his aunt, and uncle. His grandfather was the former mayor. So basically a very influential family.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, he was not completely without credit. He could be quite forceful but always persuades people to work as he wants. In short, he got the work done.</p><p><br></p><p>If I had to find a flaw, I would say it was his obsession with youkai. The guy was a fanatic. Too bad he hadn’t seen a real youkai or he wouldn’t be. Then again, I am one to talk. Despite being from a clan of onmyoji for a decade, I had never seen a youkai either but the stories I had heard from the people of the clan, even Shizuka, I’d rather not encounter them.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Even till now, I hadn’t encountered any nonhuman Supernaturals in this world. Sometimes it made me wonder how they looked but the very next second, my dad’s dead body’s image would flash before my eyes and all my curiosity went down the drain. He was killed by human cultists but… youkai were apparently even worse.</p><p><br></p><p>Coming back to Kiyotsugu, the people he was talking with were all his friends from what I know, they had been friends from elementary school.</p><p><br></p><p>Kana Ienaga, Jiro Shima, Saori Maki, Natsumi Torii and Rikuo Nura.</p><p><br></p><p>It was the last guy who gave me an odd feeling.</p><p><br></p><p>I had picked up bits of aura sensing while training under Yoriichi and somehow Rikuo had an aura far above a normal person’s.</p><p><br></p><p>His aura was different too, a bit darker than normal people.</p><p><br></p><p>He must be someone associated with the Supernatural, maybe an onmyoji or something seeing how enthusiastic he was about all this youkai stuff? But then again, that was mainly Kiyotsugu. Anyways, I wanted nothing to do with them. That's why I kept a distance from them and whatever foolishness they were up to.</p><p><br></p><p>I had something more important to look forward to today.</p><p><br></p><p>Koji-san had convinced the Chief to let me enter another Treasure competition with Naruto and today was the result.</p><p><br></p><p>I brought my manga out from my bag and looked at the polls for last week.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! Is that the jump from this week?” I suddenly heard a voice from behind me and looked back to see another figure.</p><p><br></p><p>Shinohira, another girl from our class.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.” I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Heh! Ikuse, are you an Otaku?” She said teasingly.</p><p><br></p><p>“I like manga. I want to be a mangaka someday.” I replied evenly.</p><p><br></p><p>I already was one though.</p><p><br></p><p>“A mangaka? Yes, you were in the art club, right. Good good.”</p><p><br></p><p>This short conversation attracted the attention of many people in the room, even the ones I didn’t want to.</p><p><br></p><p>“Really? You want to be a mangaka, Ikuse? Man that’s a surprise. I have heard that you were the top of your year in your last school. I would have thought you would try other jobs. Anyways, what manga do you like?” Jiro Shima, a person from the ‘To Avoid’ group asked me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm… I…”</p><p><br></p><p>“I like Kimetsu no Yaiba. It’s awesome.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Exactly. I like Giyu Tomioka . He’s so cool.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I… think Shinobu Kocho looks cute.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The best style however has to be Thunder Breathing.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Right right. Thunder Breathing First Form: Thunderclap and Flash… zoom.”</p><p><br></p><p>And just like that the whole classroom erupted in discussions about manga.</p><p><br></p><p>The scene would be quite different if this were a high school. This was still a period where Otaku were looked down upon among people above a certain age. Oh, that didn’t do anything to reduce the numbers of readers. They were still rising but it would take some time for the information age to set in and this industry to truly become a mega giant.</p><p><br></p><p>“Still, I didn’t like it when Rengoku died.”</p><p><br></p><p>It was a very odd feeling.</p><p><br></p><p>I wondered what they would do if they knew I was the one drawing the manga.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, that only means these demons are just that strong. I mean he did fight against one of the strongest ones.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But still…”</p><p><br></p><p>“I wonder what the author is planning next. I really want someone to bash Akaza's face.” Jiro said with gritted teeth.</p><p><br></p><p>“Say Ikuse, would you like to join us for the special youkai quiz? It could help you out when thinking of ideas for a manga.” Kiyotsugu put an arm around my shoulder and asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah… I would like to but I have to do homework and I also have some classes and…” I made up some excuses and avoided them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh, that’s too bad. Join us next time.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha yeah, sure.”</p><p><br></p><p>With that the day passed by somehow.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>Inside the training room, today I wanted to buy the bloodlines from the Naruto world. I had finally drawn the Chunin Exam chapter where Hashirama appears for the first time and the Senju Bloodline was finally available after Tobi read it today.</p><p><br></p><p>Along with it was the Wood Style Bloodline.</p><p><br></p><p>So I had three options.</p><p><br></p><p>Uzumaki for Chakra, Senju for Physique and Uchiha for Sharingan.</p><p><br></p><p>I noticed that Sharingan can be purchased without having the Uchiha bloodline but it would make me a Kakashi and I wouldn’t be able to use the power of the Sharingan fully.</p><p><br></p><p>First one I chose was the Senju Bloodline.</p><p><br></p><p>Stronger body would give me assistance with my swordsmanship too… and last but not the least, the Wood Style.</p><p><br></p><p>Wood Manipulation was a skill only mastered by the Kushihashi Clan’s Seiryu host.</p><p><br></p><p>I wonder how their faces would be if they found out someone else could use Wood Style, even better than them?</p><p><br></p><p>A vial containing a red liquid appeared in front of me when I purchased the bloodline.</p><p><br></p><p>So, I had to drink it?</p><p><br></p><p>I opened the vial’s cork and gulped down the liquid.</p><p><br></p><p>As the liquid went down my throat, a warm sensation flowed through my body. It was comfortable enough to make me moan.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Name: Tatsuya Ikuse </strong></p><p><strong>System Rank: D</strong></p><p><strong>Body:(F-99)</strong></p><p><strong>Mind:(F-56)</strong></p><p><strong>Spirit:(F-29)</strong></p><p><strong>Magic:(G-28)</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Points: 1,089,225 </strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Manga: </strong>Demon Slayer, One Piece, Naruto</p><p><strong>Features Unlocked: </strong>Training Room, Mentor System</p><p><strong>Inventory: </strong>Nichirin Blade x 1, </p><p><strong>Shop</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I checked my status and saw that my Body Stat had increased by almost 15 points. I clenched and could feel the increased strength as well as vitality in my body. My Chakra had risen by a lot too. It was almost double.</p><p><br></p><p>I decided to train for a week first and get used to my new body before buying the other bloodlines and to do so, I had just the teacher in mind.</p><p><br></p><p>“Summon Tobirama Senju.”</p><p><br></p><p>The guy who taught Hiruzen Sarutobi and probably the best jutsu creator in the whole Naruto world.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>A month had passed since the day I got my Senju Bloodline.</p><p><br></p><p>During this time, I bought other bloodlines one by one at every week’s interval.</p><p><br></p><p>The Uzumaki Bloodline didn’t give me as much gain as the Senju one but still pushed my Body to the E Rank and my Chakra reserves went up by another fold. Yes, it doubled… again.</p><p><br></p><p>I now had Special Jonin level chakra all of a sudden.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, these bloodlines are such utter cheats. I could understand why these three Clans were so much stronger than the other ones.</p><p><br></p><p>Last but not the least came the Uchiha Bloodline, which was quite different from the previous two.</p><p><br></p><p>It didn’t affect my body but rather my Spirit and gave me a twenty points increase in my spirit. There was also a slight increase in chakra but it felt as if the quality of my chakra was increasing as time went by. It was more potent.</p><p><br></p><p>Just these three bloodlines saved me months of training to increase my stats.</p><p><br></p><p>I also noticed that my strength increased faster now. The stat gain rate which had slowed down previously had become a bit faster.</p><p><br></p><p>It might have been due to the fact that I was growing older now, entering puberty and it was the best time for my body to grow, but the effect of the bloodline was without a doubt undeniable.</p><p><br></p><p>Not to mention, fucking Tobirama Senju was a beast. That guy put me through the grinder. I mean it wasn’t as if the others that I summoned were easy but this guy was the most brutal one yet.</p><p><br></p><p>Today was the day I was planning to get a Sharingan as I had assimilated the Uchiha Bloodline finally.</p><p><br></p><p>I took a deep breath and bought the Sharingan, my points going down as another vial appeared in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>This time however, unlike the previous times, it was a green one. </p><p><br></p><p>I was already familiar with the process by now so I drank the liquid directly.</p><p><br></p><p>A warm sensation enveloped my eyes and the scene around me suddenly became more well defined.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the fan spinning above me and they felt as if they had slowed down as I concentrated. I was able to see the designs in the blades of the fan too.</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly manipulated the Training Room to summon a mirror in front of me and looked at my reflection.</p><p><br></p><p>Red Eyes with one Tomoe in each eye. Apart from that, I felt a slight increase in Chakra too.</p><p><br></p><p>I had bought the One Tomoe Sharingan and I could either train or buy each step to evolve them.</p><p><br></p><p>I checked my stats again.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Name: Tatsuya Ikuse </strong></p><p><strong>System Rank: D</strong></p><p><strong>Body:(E-05)</strong></p><p><strong>Mind:(F-62)</strong></p><p><strong>Spirit:(F-58)</strong></p><p><strong>Magic:(G-32)</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Points: 591,282 </strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Manga: Demon Slayer, One Piece, Naruto</strong></p><p><strong>Features Unlocked: Training Room, Mentor System</strong></p><p><strong>Inventory: Nichirin Blade x 1 </strong></p><p><strong>Shop</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Another increase in Spirit and Chakra. So, Sharingan opening increased Chakra too. Good.</p><p><br></p><p>Let’s see what else it can do.</p><p><br></p><p>For today’s mentor, I selected a newly unlocked character… Itachi Uchiha.</p><p><br></p><p>After all, Madara was hundreds of chapters away and Itachi was second only to Madara in terms of his Sharingan Mastery.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Tobio -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Nii-san, are you sure this is good?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Tatsu-nii looked at him and corrected his posture. “Yes. Spin and slash.” He said as he demonstrated the move.</p><p><br></p><p>Hinokami Kagura or as Tobio knew it, Sun Breathing.</p><p><br></p><p>He wondered how he was stuck practising it all of a sudden.</p><p><br></p><p>It started when their teacher at the school had told them about a cultural competition where they had to give performances. It could be anything from poems, songs to dances.</p><p><br></p><p>Some of his friends had given his name for a dance without telling him and before he could deny anything, even his teacher left the room.</p><p><br></p><p>He was thinking about taking his name out but Sae-chan said she was looking forward to his performance and he hesitated to take back his name and now he was stuck with it.</p><p><br></p><p>Tobio had no idea what to do.</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t know any dances.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s when his Nii-san came back home from his dorms so Tobio decided to ask him for help.</p><p><br></p><p>Although very few people knew this, Nii-san was a genius who had made not one but two manga.</p><p> </p><p>He was also always the top of his year and extremely smart.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why Tobio thought he could offer him some advice. But for the life of him, he was not expecting this.</p><p><br></p><p>This was a thing from one of his manga so then why did he know how to do this?</p><p><br></p><p>Did he create it?</p><p><br></p><p>“Nii-san… are you sure this… dance is okay? They won’t make fun of me, right?” he asked, hesitantly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry. No one is going to make fun of you. I will even get you Tanjiro’s clothes which he wore while doing the dance and you will look super cute.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Tatsu is right, Tobi. The Dance looks wonderful. I didn’t expect Tatsu to be able to create such a beautiful dance too. It reminds me of the dance that my birth family members used to do in rituals to offer their prayers to the Goddess Amaterasu. I think this one is even more beautiful.” Grandma said from the side. “Can you show me the full dance, Tatsu?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, Grandma.” With that Nii-san took a cardboard sword and began dancing.</p><p><br></p><p>He noticed that there were no hesitations in his movements, and all his cuts were sharp. It was almost as if he was wielding a real sword.</p><p><br></p><p>Tobio wasn’t sure but it felt as if waves of flames were emerging around him whenever he spun or slashed the cardboard sword. The whole scene was stunning when he saw it from an outsider’s perspective.</p><p><br></p><p>A while later, he finished the dance and bowed.</p><p><br></p><p>“See… this is how it's done. Do you think anyone will make fun of it?”</p><p><br></p><p>Tobio shook his head dumbly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then what are you waiting for? Take the stance. I will train you for the entire month.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>They both took the pose and spun around to do the first dance movement.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Koji Yoshida -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He watched as the chief read the first chapter of ‘Naruto’.</p><p><br></p><p>The oneshot had been a massive success, winning Tatsuya his second award.</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, with the current popularity of Demon Slayer, anything that Tatsuya wrote would attract a crowd and a Shounen Manga based on shinobi like Naruto were always good ideas among teenagers.</p><p><br></p><p>In ordinary cases, the serialisation was a done deal if it had been someone else but… Tatsuya was not just an ordinary someone.</p><p><br></p><p>The chief kept down the manga and looked at him. “You want to submit this for serialisation.”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded. “It has too much potential not to.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You could always wait for a few years, until he is older to submit this. I am sure it will be well received even after that. Working on two manga would put undue stress on the boy. Kimetsu no Yaiba is one of the top running manga right now. If he picks another one, especially one with such potential, there is a chance that he would ruin both.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm… about that… he has already finished drawing Kimetsu no Yaiba. That’s why he started working on the new idea.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Tatsuya-kun has completed two hundred chapters of Kimetsu no Yaiba. He has already drawn the ending of the story. That was the main reason I am asking for this one to be serialised. By the time Demon Slayer ends, it will pick up speed.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Does he want Demon Slayer to end in just two hundred chapters?”</p><p><br></p><p>“He said that while he could drag the story more, it would reduce the quality of the work. He will not compromise on that. Naruto would make up for everything.”</p><p><br></p><p>“He is twelve, right?” The chief asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Koji nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“How does he do all this? What about his own life, his studies. He will likely hamper his life if he gives so much time to manga at this age.”</p><p><br></p><p>His face took on a helpless look.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tatsuya-kun is at the top of his year at school. He has been the top of his year, every year since he started his schooling. Even the Junior High he goes to has offered him a full scholarship to have him.”</p><p><br></p><p>He saw the chief’s mouth open in disbelief. “You are kidding me, right?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I could show you all the certificates.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man let out a sigh. “Alright, grant him this spot. We will print the first chapter in next week’s Jump.”</p><p><br></p><p>Koji quickly bowed. “Thank you, boss.”</p><p><br></p><p>He quickly went out and informed Heshi-san about the change.</p><p><br></p><p>“Seriously, boss allowed that?” Heishi-san asked, surprised too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. For next week’s Jump.” He nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh, which Manga is getting the slot for next week’s Jump?” Yamahisa asked, peeking from his seat.</p><p><br></p><p>“Naruto.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What! Kishibe-sensei got another slot? But isn’t he doing Demon Slayer too?”</p><p><br></p><p>“He will be doing both.” Koji smirked. After all, Koji was the editor of Rohan Kishibe.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Tatsuya -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Kai!” I released a burst of chakra, breaking through the Genjutsu and jumped aside right in time to dodge a barrage of kunai… just for a pair of hands to come up from the ground I had landed at and pull me in.</p><p><br></p><p>I took my sword and thrust it directly at my feet.</p><p><br></p><p>The hand was struck but it exploded instead, throwing me to the side.</p><p><br></p><p>“Aghhhhhh!” I shouted as the pain from my injured leg came roaring in and found a kunai in front of my eye.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the blank face of the guy staring at me with his three tomoe Sharingan and dropped my Kunai and a moment later, he removed his own.</p><p><br></p><p>“Where did I go wrong?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Think about it yourself.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I broke the genjutsu properly this time, even the second layer.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And I had faith that you would. That’s why I won.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>He sat down while I used the training room to heal my injuries.</p><p><br></p><p>“You have habits. One of the most prominent ones is avoiding any attacks that you can.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at him questioningly and he explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“I knew you would be able to escape from the genjutsu. That's why I sent a Shadow Clone under the ground with the Headhunter Jutsu in the time it took you to break through the genjutsu. After you broke, I threw the kunai to make you dodge in the direction I wanted. I took the sword in your hand in consideration and changed my Shadow Clone to a Shadow Clone Explosion Jutsu.”</p><p><br></p><p>I thought over his analysis and asked finally. “What should I have done differently?”</p><p><br></p><p>“You have to change yourself.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What?”</p><p><br></p><p>“You have a tendency to avoid confrontation. I understand the wish to do so but when you enter combat, do it with full conviction. You could have parried the kunai with your sword, deflected them and headed straight for me. It would have been easy for you with the Sharingan… but you didn’t. You chose the safest route and while that’s not bad, in fact, being able to choose the safest route in the heat of combat is a talent in itself, it is what makes you predictable. There was also the fact that you didn’t use the aura sensing that you have. Learn to use it while in combat.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the waterfall in front of me and he continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t be upset. You have to consider the difference in our current levels. In the time it took you to break the genjutsu, I could have put a hole through your head instead of using the Shadow Clone Explosion jutsu and the Headhunter jutsu. You lost the moment you took that long to break them. If you want to win against me, learn how to not get caught in a genjutsu first.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“So the problem was my strength.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Most of it, yes. I know your wish to live a peaceful life. Believe me, I do too. <a href=\"https://But….in\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">But….in</a> this world or any, only the strong have the option of choosing nonviolence. There is always the way of not resisting but are you the type to just lay over and let others kill you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“...I see. Thank you for clearing things out for me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Good. We are going to repeat this training one hundred times more before the day ends.”</p><p><br></p><p>“One hundred! We only have eight hours.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s four hundred and eighty minutes. That’s more than four minutes for every fight. I promise I will keep it shorter than that.”</p><p><br></p><p>….bastard.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I lay down on my bed.</p><p><br></p><p>Although all fatigue and injuries were removed by the Training Room, training like that took a great toll on the mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Itachi’s method of teaching was through live combat.</p><p><br></p><p>He would teach me something, let me understand it well enough to be able to do it myself and then he put me through combat, repeatedly to help me hone that skill.</p><p><br></p><p>It also made me realise that just knowing something didn’t make you stronger. You have to know how to incorporate it in different situations.</p><p><br></p><p>With Itachi’s sense of combat, even if I bought the Flying Thunder God, he would likely predict where I would appear and plant a landmine there in advance….the guy was just that frightening.</p><p><br></p><p>But it also meant that my combat experience was rising every moment.</p><p><br></p><p>Against him, I was getting one or two stat points, almost everyday in Body, Mind and Spirit.</p><p><br></p><p>Body and Mind stats increased due to the constant stress of combat while my Spirit was being tempered by the constant Genjutsu attacks and trying to break it.</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t allow me to replenish my chakra using the Training Room until I was on the verge of fainting from Chakra Exhaustion. The guy even had the balls to tell me to completely exhaust my chakra and experience what dying would feel like so that I could increase the power of my Sharingan in that moment of stress.</p><p><br></p><p>It was crazy. A good idea….but crazy.</p><p><br></p><p>I might just do it once.</p><p><br></p><p>I had tried using Shadow Clones for drawing manga but the thing is, I still didn’t have enough chakra. Oh my Chakra growth was insane. I was already a Jonin level in terms of chakra alone but it wasn’t enough to sustain the long term use of Shadow Clones.</p><p><br></p><p>The feedback from the Shadow Clones was insane.</p><p><br></p><p>I now understand why only someone like Naruto could do such training.</p><p><br></p><p>Normal people would have their brains fried by that.</p><p><br></p><p>I had tried using the Shadow Clones for an extended period of time. In fact, I kept only three of those active for eight hours inside the Training Room and drew manga.</p><p><br></p><p>I could do so due to constantly replenishing my chakra using the Training Room.</p><p><br></p><p>It was hard. Drawing a manga requires a lot of concentration and is a stressful job. Keeping the clones active required even more attention since they did have minds of their own and their thoughts could stray.</p><p><br></p><p>But the real problem came when they were dispelled. It was the day, I found a loophole in the Training Room’s healing function.</p><p><br></p><p>If the user becomes brain dead….they only get healed at the end of the day when the Training Room’s time is up.</p><p><br></p><p>I woke up after 6 hours that day and have never used a Shadow Clone for that kind of thing. The worst part was that all the manga drawn inside the Training Room disappeared as well.</p><p><br></p><p>Apparently I couldn’t abuse the Training Room’s regen to work. It should only be for <em>training</em>.</p><p><br></p><p>Talk about being petty.</p><p><br></p><p>That was one of the reasons why I was putting myself through this training under Itachi. It increases the mind and spirit stat to help me handle more information.</p><p><br></p><p>Multi Shadow Clones were rightfully a forbidden jutsu. Even ten minutes from each clone could add up to hours of time and that is an extremely large amount of information for someone.</p><p><br></p><p>At this moment, I heard my phone ring and forced myself to pick up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Koji-san?”</p><p><br></p><p>It was my editor who informed me that Naruto will be coming up in next week’s Jump.</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled at this good news.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I entered my class that day and Jiro, who was already in the classroom, came running to me. In his hands was a manga.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ikuse, did you see this? Kishibe-sensei released a new manga. It’s about Shinobi.” He opened the first page and showed me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. It was published as a oneshot a while ago. It even won the Treasure Award for this year.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Really?! I didn't know that. Do you think he will continue Kimetsu no Yaiba?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I don't see why not.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Man, that's a relief. Still, Naruto is awesome. He had a youkai sealed inside him. A nine tailed fox at that. Aren't they supposed to be the strongest kinds of youkai?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Indeed. Nine Tailed foxes are known as living natural disasters. They are among the top youkai out there.” And there he was. Kiyotsugu appeared as soon as the word youkai was uttered. Did he have some kind of sensor?</p><p><br></p><p>And with that they jumped into discussion about different youkai.</p><p><br></p><p>“That reminds me, Ikuse, we are going to look for youkai in the old school building tonight. According to the information I have found out, it’s a prime hotspot of youkai in this town. You are invited.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>I was too tired to even deadpan at them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Youkai! Are there really youkai in the old school building?” I asked, pretending to be afraid.</p><p><br></p><p>I observed from the corner of my eye that Rikuo was also getting nervous too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously. My information is without a doubt. There are youkai in the old school building without a doubt.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ehhhhhhhh! I think I will pass. I am very scared of these kinds of things.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What! Don’t be a wus, Ikuse.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t wanna.” I denied.</p><p><br></p><p>“But why! This is a once in a lifetime chance.”</p><p><br></p><p>“For what? Getting killed?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, nothing will happen.” He tried to reassure me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright tell me something.” I tried to reason.</p><p><br></p><p>“What? Do you have any questions about youkai? If so, then you have come to the right person.”</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t know much about youkai but the information I have come from actual credible sources and they conflict with more than half the things you say. So I doubt that you are the right person.</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay, then tell me what you plan to do if you do find a youkai in the old school building?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm I will obviously prove that youkai exist.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes… and what next?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well you have thought of nothing about it. Then tell me what if you meet some dangerous youkai? What do you plan to do then?”</p><p><br></p><p>With each of my questions the look on his face became bleak.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ikuse-kun is right.” Rikuo quickly intervened. “There could be something dangerous in the building.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Exactly. Even if there are no youkai, the building has been abandoned for a long time and it might have some parts in disrepair and even be home to snakes or other poisonous insects. You could get injured if you go there, especially at night.”</p><p><br></p><p>The guy looked at me open mouthed. “You… have given me a lot to think about. Next time, I shall prepare for all these situations as well.”</p><p><br></p><p>….so you are not giving up at all?</p><p><br></p><p>As long as you don’t drag me in, I have no problem.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I couldn’t sleep at night.</p><p><br></p><p>Constant training and work was taking its toll on my mind so I decided to take a break.</p><p><br></p><p>I decided to walk around on the roof of my dorm. It had a great view of the surrounding area and was a nice place where I could sit down and chill.</p><p><br></p><p>Sitting on the corner of the roof, I thought of how to increase the sales of manga. If I put forward another manga, they would begin to doubt me.</p><p><br></p><p>And Naruto is a very long series. It would take over a decade to be fully published.</p><p><br></p><p>I needed to find a way around this problem.</p><p><br></p><p>But how….</p><p><br></p><p>Hmm.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe if I couldn’t publish One Piece under another identity.</p><p><br></p><p>But making the documents and a fake identity was not easy. I didn’t even know how to get those.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s something I needed to find out on my own.</p><p><br></p><p>Once I could do that, all I needed was Henge and I could easily make another identity.</p><p><br></p><p>Now where do I begin?</p><p><br></p><p>As I was thinking of this, I saw a group of people, students to be exact, going towards the school.</p><p><br></p><p>I had enhanced senses and seeing something like that was easy.</p><p><br></p><p>It took me no effort to recognise who they were.</p><p><br></p><p>Those idiots.</p><p><br></p><p>Were they really going towards that place?</p><p><br></p><p>That fool was generally wrong about most things he said about youkai but one thing he was likely not wrong about was the old school building.</p><p><br></p><p>At first I didn’t know about it either but as my senses became sharper, especially after I gained my Sharingan, I could feel the wrongness from the building.</p><p><br></p><p>It was an instinct of sorts, coming from the training I have had under Yoriichi and others.</p><p><br></p><p>Although I didn’t know what, there was something very wrong with that building.</p><p><br></p><p>And now these fools wanted to go <a href=\"https://there….at\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">there….at</a> night.</p><p><br></p><p>What should I do?</p><p><br></p><p>Dammit….I really didn’t want to get involved in all this mess.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly, I had an idea.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t need to get <a href=\"https://involved….at\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">involved….at</a> least not directly.</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly created a shadow clone and it used henge before rushing down the building to follow the group.</p><p><br></p><p>As for me, I went back to my home and locked myself in.</p><p><br></p><p>If there is indeed something and the clone has to bail them out, I had ordered it to break that Kiyotsugu fucker’s legs so that he cannot go to these expeditions again.</p><p><br></p><p>If the clone gets killed by someone, I am leaving the school and going back home.</p><p><br></p><p>Some might call this cowardice.</p><p><br></p><p>I call it the sense of self preservation.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Shadow Clone -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He jumped on a tree near the building and checked the group from outside.</p><p><br></p><p>The sharingan was helpful in such situations but he didn’t have the privilege of using it as it would consume chakra quickly and he might need to fight someone.</p><p><br></p><p>The only thing he could do from now was sense auras… and damn, the boss wasn’t wrong about the building.</p><p><br></p><p>Up close it was as if a den of demons of some kind.</p><p><br></p><p>Boss had even summoned Kokushibo as a mentor once to understand how a demon felt and the feeling was not pleasant at all, and this building was giving him a similar kind of feeling.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly he saw something strange inside the building.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy whom the boss suspected to be related to some supernatural, an onmyoji or something similar encountered one of those dark auras… stared at it for a moment and then turned and diverted his friends in another direction.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next few minutes, he saw the guy trying his best to divert the attention of his friends from any place that might have those auras, which he was becoming more and more sure were youkai.</p><p><br></p><p>It was when they headed towards the biggest aura in the place that he decided to take a closer look.</p><p><br></p><p>Most of the other auras were not bloodthirsty. Some were even harmless.</p><p><br></p><p>That one however…</p><p><br></p><p>And sure enough he heard a loud sound of glass shattering and a shriek from Ienaga.</p><p><br></p><p>It took him less than a second to reach there and he saw what seemed to be a huge grasshopper about to attack Rikuo and Ienaga.</p><p><br></p><p>Almost instantly, his hands moved as he shouted at the top of his lungs.</p><p><br></p><p>“GET DOWN!”</p><p><br></p><p>The two turned back and instantly jumped to the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>Chakra churned inside his body as he put everything in the attack.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Fire Style: Great Fireball Jutsu!</em></p><p><br></p><p>A large ball of fire went towards that grasshopper, completely incinerating it into ashes.</p><p><br></p><p>That was the last thing that he saw before his chakra was completely consumed and he was dispelled.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Tatsuya -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Dammit!</p><p><br></p><p>There were actually youkai in that building.</p><p><br></p><p>And sure enough Rikuo was someone related to the Supernatural.</p><p><br></p><p>He was actually keeping them away from danger but those fools were too excited to have any self preservation.</p><p><br></p><p>Too bad my Shadow Clone popped before breaking that fucker’s legs.</p><p><br></p><p>But the most important thing was there are youkai near my school.</p><p><br></p><p>They hadn’t attacked anyone… before this but still, this was the first time I had seen one.</p><p><br></p><p>I knew that I wasn’t strong enough yet.</p><p><br></p><p>The pressure I had felt from Nobuhiro Kusihashi that day… was far more than what I had felt from that grasshopper. </p><p><br></p><p>That means, there were stronger beings out there.</p><p><br></p><p>I needed to increase my training.</p><p><br></p><p>I needed to get stronger.</p><p><br></p><p>________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x_____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server </strong><a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: LuluViBritania(FF.N, SB and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Another chapter of ‘Drawn to Power’ is up.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Tatsuya has weird luck.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The more he avoids trouble, the more he goes towards trouble.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>At least he had good teachers.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I wanted to write this from a completely blind to the DxD perspective because having canon knowledge would just make most things a speed run.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>This makes things funnier.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Anyways, we will see more of the story in the next chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The next chapters will be SAO and Isekai Restaurant.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br><br></p>",

I have already finished my work so I was using my free time doing something productive.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You are not supposed to be drawing in class.” She retorted.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, so you don’t want to read the next chapter of my manga?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I….I didn’t say that. I am just saying that you need to study in class.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes yes. I will. Anyways, we have art class now, right?” I waved her off.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmph.” </p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, calm down and help me see how the new chapter is. I have finished it already.” I gave her the pages of the manga and watched her read my story intently.</p><p><br></p><p>Nearly ten minutes later she set the book aside and looked at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tanjiro and Nezuko are so pitiful. Hmph, those demons are all bad after all.”</p><p><br></p><p>While she was complaining a message flashed in front of my eyes. I called Status in my mind to check.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Name: Tatsuya Kushihashi</strong></p><p><strong>System Rank: F</strong></p><p><strong>Body:(G-12)</strong></p><p><strong>Mind:(G-16)</strong></p><p><strong>Spirit:(G-20)</strong></p><p><strong>Magic:(G-9)</strong></p><p><strong>Points: 91</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Manga: Demon Slayer</strong></p><p><br></p><p>One point finally.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. This was my life now.</p><p><br></p><p>My life has suddenly become a game.</p><p><br></p><p>Well, not suddenly and this is certainly not the only strange thing about me.</p><p><br></p><p>The first would be the fact that I am a reincarnator.</p><p><br></p><p>In the memories I gained, which I assume was my past life, I was an aspiring Mangaka but passed away in an accident.</p><p><br></p><p>It has been several years since that day.</p><p><br></p><p>I woke up in this world, slowly regaining the memories of my previous life.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a bit disconcerting at first but I slowly got used to it.</p><p><br></p><p>I have loving parents. Mother who, despite not spending a lot of time with me, had done all she could to shower me with love before her illness took her life.</p><p><br></p><p>My Father too didn’t slack off and has taken really good care of me despite his extremely busy schedule.</p><p><br></p><p>I still remember my parents from my previous life but these two people have made their place in my life which is no less than theirs.</p><p><br></p><p>There were some ups and downs but overall, my life was fine.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, there were a few surprising things in this world too.</p><p><br></p><p>Magic.</p><p><br></p><p>This world had magic.</p><p><br></p><p>Apparently, there were ghosts and youkai in this world as well as Gods.</p><p><br></p><p>My Father’s clan was a clan of Onmyoji. One of the Five Principal Clans of Japan, the Kushihashi Clan who housed the Azure Dragon of the East. The Clan was blessed by the Shinto Gods which allowed them to use special powers.</p><p><br></p><p>For the Kushihashi, these powers were Wood Manipulation, Air Manipulation and Lightning Manipulation.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, we had the most abilities among all the Principal Clans.</p><p><br></p><p>Anyways, that's something for later.</p><p><br></p><p>Recently, a change happened in my life.</p><p><br></p><p>Six months ago, I started seeing a screen in front of my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>At first I had thought someone was pulling a prank on me as I often read manga and light novels but within an hour I found out that it was real.</p><p><br></p><p>And wasn’t that a surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>It seems that I am here with the complete Isekai package now.</p><p><br></p><p>Anyways, over the months, I had figured some things about the System.</p><p><br></p><p>I called it the Mangaka System.</p><p><br></p><p>The Rank of the System was divided into seven Ranks, from F to S, with F being the lowest and S being the Highest. Below F was G which is used for normal humans.</p><p><br></p><p>I get one manga from the system for every Rank and I gain points for anyone who reads these manga. They are given through a lucky draw for which I will need Gacha Tickets.</p><p><br></p><p>There are no restrictions for drawing my own manga but it wouldn't count for anything system related.</p><p><br></p><p>This part had made me laugh. The choice was all in my hands.</p><p><br></p><p>I could do whatever I wanted on my own but if I want the System's help, I will have to work as it says. </p><p><br></p><p>With the points I earn, I can use the System shop. However, I can only buy items within the Rank of my System and the items will only belong to an active or completed manga I get from the System and only up to the chapter I have drawn. In fact, the items were added to the shop when I completed the chapter where they appear first and at least one person reads it first.</p><p><br></p><p>So at F Rank, I could probably buy common swords from Demon Slayer but no Sun Breathing. For that I would have to upgrade my System to a higher Rank.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a bit restrictive but hey, I was getting a massive cheat like this. Why should I complain?</p><p><br></p><p>I could unlock higher levels of the System by completing quests.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Upgrade Quest: Say my name.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Let the world know your name for the first time.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sell Ten Thousand copies of your manga. (0/10,000)</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Reward: E Rank System Upgrade, Gacha Ticket x 1</strong></p><p><br></p><p>My first quest was to sell ten thousand copies of my manga.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, that was something which would make me wait for a while.</p><p><br></p><p>Which means I am stuck at the F Rank till I’m older as I have no way to get my story published and sell that many copies.</p><p><br></p><p>To be honest it wasn't a bad thing for me. It wasn't as if I couldn't train and increase my power. </p><p><br></p><p>Next is the Kushihashi Clan. It was primarily a Clan of Onmyoji and thus the kids were trained in magical arts.</p><p><br></p><p>The magic training would start later but according to my father, I could skip it if I wanted to. He didn’t want me to force myself to do those things if I didn’t want to and for that, I’m grateful.</p><p><br></p><p>I liked drawing. I drew the manga and showed them to some people around me to read so that I could get some points.</p><p><br></p><p>And among the people was my second fan in this world, the girl sitting beside me, Shizuka Himejima. She was a member of another Principal Clan like mine, the Himejima Clan which houses the spirit of Suzaku, the Vermillion Bird of the South.</p><p><br></p><p>We studied at the same elementary school and due to the relations of the clans, we had a very good relationship.</p><p><br></p><p>Well, for one, she wasn’t as annoying as the other children from the remaining clans.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you like it or not?” I asked, stopping her rant for a moment.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well it was not….bad.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah….just not bad. Then maybe I should stop writing this one.” I pretended to be upset.</p><p><br></p><p>“What! No. I mean you can still do a lot better if you work harder. But we are just in elementary school. You will obviously get better.” She tried to cheer me up quickly and I smirked.</p><p><br></p><p>She realised that she was tricked and punched me on my shoulder, not meeting my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I returned home after school to an empty house.</p><p><br></p><p>Dad’s been out for some work and will be returning today but the maid has already done all the work.</p><p><br></p><p>My dad had many privileges in the clan. There were two reasons for it.</p><p><br></p><p>First, he was the grandnephew of the current Clan head and second… he was strong.</p><p><br></p><p>I have seen him using Magic and damn if that wasn’t cool.</p><p><br></p><p>It was as if straight out of some kind of anime.</p><p><br></p><p>From what I have heard from others talking, he also had a title, the Lightning Fist, which was due to him coating his fists with lightning in his fights.</p><p><br></p><p>I remember I was so hyped about learning that magic too but dad said I needed to be older to do so and till then, he only told me to concentrate on physical training.</p><p><br></p><p>I took off my shoes and wore the indoor slippers and returned to my room.</p><p><br></p><p>Safety was never a problem in this place as it was in the Clan area, although on the outskirts.</p><p><br></p><p>There are very few people who would want to rob the Clan of superpowered demon slayers.</p><p><br></p><p>I went in for a bath and when I came out, I heard someone opening the door.</p><p><br></p><p>Before I could worry, I heard Dad’s voice.</p><p><br></p><p>“I’m home, Tatsu.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Welcome back.”</p><p><br></p><p>I shouted while coming down the stairs.</p><p><br></p><p>My father, Hiroshi Kushihashi was a man in his thirties, grey haired and golden eyed.</p><p><br></p><p>I took after him in terms of looks having the same hair and eye colour but I have the shape of my mom’s face… or at least what he says.</p><p><br></p><p>Speaking of my mom, she was from Italy so I had some caucasian features.</p><p><br></p><p>They had met with each other when she came here for some work and were introduced to each other through a mutual friend. </p><p><br></p><p>My dad had married her despite the protests of the clan who were hardcore traditionalist people. It was one the reasons that we were living on the outskirts of the clan despite Dad being the reserve heir of the Clan.</p><p><br></p><p>That's why the clan mostly kept away from me. They didn't do anything to harm me and gave me the same facilities as the other members of the clan so I don't mind them either.</p><p><br></p><p>We are all free to make our own choices.</p><p><br></p><p>He brushed my hair with a smile before handing me some takeouts.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you eat?” I asked while moving towards the kitchen.</p><p><br></p><p>“Not yet. I wanted to eat with my cute son today. Let me take a bath first.” He said in a happy mood.</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay, I will set the plates till then.” I replied happily.</p><p><br></p><p>Okonomiyaki was my favourite after all.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“So, how is it?” I asked, as I took a bite from my plate.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is really good. Your drawings are becoming better each day. I think you have real talent with this.” He replied as he turned the last page of the chapter and kept the manga aside.</p><p><br></p><p>I checked and saw 10 points had increased from him reading one chapter alone.</p><p><br></p><p>In the past days, I had observed a trend. Not every person gave the same amount of points when they read my comics.</p><p><br></p><p>For example it took some others and Shizuka reading a chapter of my manga to give me only one point while dad alone reading a single chapter could give me ten points.</p><p><br></p><p>I have several speculations about this.</p><p><br></p><p>It may be related to how close they are to me or maybe how strong they were. I haven’t been able to test it with someone else at my dad’s level yet.</p><p><br></p><p>He alone netted me around 90% of my points.</p><p><br></p><p>There could always be other factors.</p><p><br></p><p>“You think so?” I asked, feeling happy at his compliment.</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously. I guess you are my son after all hahahaha.”</p><p><br></p><p>“... you can’t draw to save your life, dad. Remember the last art class where you helped me?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh! No way. I… didn’t want you to rely on me to do your homework. It was a… life lesson. Yes, a life lesson.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes yes. I totally believe you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Wha….! You don’t believe me. You don’t believe me, do you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh? What clued you in?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hah… when I was younger I could have totally become a mangaka if I wanted. I could have rivalled the likes of Akira Yamatori. Let me tell you a secret. It was me who sent the idea for Drag-so-ball to him. The dragon was based on Seiryu-sama but they had to change the name for copyright reasons. Shenron, Seiryu… both start with an S. See…”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>I was too far gone to even roll my eyes at the joke.</p><p><br></p><p>And Akira Yamatori… seriously… what kind of jumbled up world was this? Not to mention Drag-so-ball.</p><p><br></p><p>“Now, let’s talk about other matters. I have heard you are very close to Shizuka-chan from the Himejima Clan? Is that true?” He smirked with a goofy look on his face.</p><p><br></p><p>“...yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hoh oh… I mean I agree. She is adorable and will no doubt grow up to be a beautiful young woman. Dad approves.” He gave me a thumbs up.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am in elementary school, dad.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Just more time to get to know each other.”</p><p><br></p><p>He kept teasing me after that.</p><p><br></p><p>We talked and had fun before retiring for the night.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“Where are we going, dad?” I asked, looking out of the window.</p><p><br></p><p>“To meet a friend of mine.” He said, not looking away from the road while driving. “We are almost there.”</p><p><br></p><p>What I didn’t expect was for him to stop in front of the Shueisha building.</p><p><br></p><p>My head snapped back as I looked at my dad giving me a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why are we here?” I asked, not understanding his intention.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did I tell you I could have become a mangaka when I was young and you didn’t believe me? Well, let me prove it today.”</p><p><br></p><p>I found myself staring at him in stunned silence.</p><p><br></p><p>“Come on. Don’t get left behind. We have a meeting in fifteen minutes.” He said when he parked the car and I quickly opened the door and followed him, still trying to comprehend what was happening.</p><p><br></p><p>After going through some checks, I found myself in a small cabin with my dad, waiting for someone.</p><p><br></p><p>The door opened and a young man with black hair fell just above his shoulders. He looked like he was in his early twenties.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at dad and smiled. “Hiro-senpai, how are you? It’s been so long since we met. I heard from some friends that you even got married and had a child.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha yes. I got busy with work and life. How have you been, Koji-kun? You seem to have found your favourite job after all.”</p><p><br></p><p>The guy smiled and sat down. “It was thanks to the support of you all. Thanks for always encouraging me.”</p><p><br></p><p>They talked about a few things before the man’s attention turned towards me. “Is he?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. This is my son, Tatsuya.” I bowed to the man who nodded while dad continued. “He doesn’t believe that I was super talented in art and could become a mangaka in my younger days if I wanted to.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at him in shock.</p><p><br></p><p>Did he really bring me here to prove this point?</p><p><br></p><p>“Ehhh that’s a bit…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Wha…! Didn’t I draw a bunch of dogs for the School Fest to decorate the classroom. Everyone liked it. You said so yourself.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Those were dogs! I thought they were elephants.” The main exclaimed, actually looking shocked.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>After the awkward silence which lasted a few moments more than I would have liked, my dad coughed and directly changed the topic.</p><p><br></p><p>“Anyways, I needed your opinion on something. Can you spare me a few minutes of your time?”</p><p><br></p><p>The man quickly grabbed the line of escape and agreed instantly.</p><p><br></p><p>My dad opened the bag he had brought with him and pulled out an envelope and gave it to the man.</p><p><br></p><p>He opened them and I saw something extremely familiar.</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly looked at my dad in shock and he only smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>That was the oneshot I had made for Demon Slayer before starting the chapters. Did he bring it to Shueisha?</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the man who was looking at the pages in a completely serious mode right now. It was a stark contrast with the goofy and shy guy who was talking with dad moments ago.</p><p><br></p><p>His expression was almost unreadable as he turned the pages one by one.</p><p><br></p><p>After what seemed like the longest fifteen minutes, he put the pages back in the envelope and looked at dad.</p><p><br></p><p>“Who drew this?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh? Why can’t you think I did? Obviously I am not bad. But how was it?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s a very interesting plot. Senpai, I am a newbie editor at Weekly Shonen Jump. I really think this manga has the ability to become a massive hit. Can you please introduce me to the author?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha well, you are right. I am not the author. It’s my adorable son, Tatsu.” He brushed my hair.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Senpai, please be serious. I am not kidding when I say that this story can be a great chance for me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hah! I am not joking, you know. It was really done by Tatsu.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man just stared at dad in a deadpan.</p><p><br></p><p>At this moment, I raised a hand. “Umm, I really did.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You drew this?” He asked, almost mockingly.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s just a one shot. I have also drawn ten chapters of the full story. If you give me a pen and a paper, I can show you.” I replied.</p><p><br></p><p>He just stared at me, not believing even now. He went to a nearby drawer and pulled out a paper and a pen.</p><p><br></p><p>“Here, show me.”</p><p><br></p><p>And show I did.</p><p><br></p><p>Drawing these characters was not too hard and I already had experience in doing so over a hundred times already.</p><p><br></p><p>Within a minute, a scene of Tanjiro using the Hinokami Kagura.</p><p><br></p><p>The man was looking at the sketch with his mouth open in shock and only broke through the shock when dad coughed from the side.</p><p><br></p><p>He pointed at me. “This…”</p><p><br></p><p>My dad just raised his eyebrows. “How about it? Isn’t he awesome?”</p><p><br></p><p>“He’s a genius.” The man said in awe.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha well obviously. Whose son do you think he is?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I guess he has inherited good drawing talent from your wife.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hey!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Anyways, what do you want to do, senpai? Although he is talented, he is still very… young.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I have researched a bit and found that there was going to be a competition for new manga authors. I want to submit this there. As for Tatsu’s age, he can use a pen name if he wants. From what I have seen, he drew ten chapters in just two months. Even if he doesn’t make a weekly release, he could easily do a monthly one. It ultimately depends on him. Anyways, all of that will come when he wins a good spot in the competition.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You can draw five chapters in a month?” He asked me, in shock.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.” I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“How much of the story do you have planned?” he asked me curiously.</p><p><br></p><p>“Over a hundred chapters.”</p><p><br></p><p>“... seriously?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No, really… seriously?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s around that more or less… for now.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright senpai I will do it. We can talk later if he gets a good result in the polls.”</p><p><br></p><p>“When… he gets a good result.” Dad corrected him.</p><p><br></p><p>The man smiled. “You really believe in him, don’t you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously. I am his father. It’s my job to have faith in him.”</p><p><br></p><p>I won’t lie but I teared a bit at the amount of confidence he was showing in me.</p><p><br></p><p>The competition was going to be held in two months.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy’s name was Koji Yoshida. He said he will inform us about everything. In the meantime, he gave us his details and told me to call him anytime I needed anything.</p><p><br></p><p>I felt I knew this name but no matter how much I tried, I couldn’t recall who he was.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>One month passed by in a flash.</p><p><br></p><p>During this time, I had stopped showing chapters to others as suggested by Koji-san.</p><p><br></p><p>My only readers were Shizuka-chan and dad so my points were rising up very slowly.</p><p><br></p><p>Although there was that incident two weeks ago.</p><p><br></p><p>I had just completed a chapter and given Shizuka to read and opened the menu to find an increase of over fifty points all of a sudden.</p><p><br></p><p>I never found out how so many people read my work all of a sudden.</p><p><br></p><p>My thoughts were broken by a knock at the door of our classroom. A staff member of the school called for me and I looked up in surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>I was led to the principal’s office and standing in there was the maid who worked in our home.</p><p><br></p><p>“Himari-san?”</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t say anything but the expression on her face was not good.</p><p><br></p><p>“We need to go home.” She spoke directly.</p><p><br></p><p>No explanations given, she held my hand and led me out.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wait, my bag is still inside.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Someone will bring it later.” She answered curtly but didn’t stop.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at her questioningly but she didn’t say anything else.</p><p><br></p><p>We soon reached the Clan’s area and directly went to the gathering place. I saw many people gathered there.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone had different types of reactions to seeing me.</p><p><br></p><p>I could hear some whispers and suddenly a pit formed in my stomach.</p><p><br></p><p>What is going on here?<br><br></p><p>When I reached the end of the crowd, I felt my knees give up at the sight in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>There, covered in a white cloth… lay my father’s… dead body.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>The entire day went by in a haze.</p><p><br></p><p>I couldn’t concentrate on what was happening around me.</p><p><br></p><p>From the bits and pieces I heard, the mission he was on turned out to be an ambush and he was killed while covering for the rest… everyone else survived.</p><p><br></p><p>What bullshit.</p><p><br></p><p>My dad was strong. He was one of the strongest people in the clan. How can he die while everyone escapes? There had to be something wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>Several doubts, several kinds of bad thoughts were plaguing my mind but all of it was buried under the pain and sadness I was experiencing.</p><p><br></p><p>It was after the funeral that the head of the Clan, Nobuhiro Kushihashi, my father’s uncle, called for me.</p><p><br></p><p>I was led to the head’s house.</p><p><br></p><p>Inside the room was the man himself sitting with a servant standing behind him.</p><p><br></p><p>He stared at me for a moment and then spoke.</p><p><br></p><p>“The Kushihashi Clan is given the honour to be the bearers of the great Seiryu. It is the supreme honour given to only ones with our blood by the Gods themselves. Each child of our Clan carries this blessing… and those who do not… are no members of our clan. Hiroshi married a woman from a different land, a different faith, against the will of the Clan and had you. We didn’t remove him because he still carried the blessing of our Gods and was still worthy of the Kushihashi name. You however… do not. The only reason you were permitted to stay in the Clan was due to Hiroshi. Now that he is not here, you are not welcome here anymore. I will give you an hour. Take your belongings and get ready. The maid will escort you out.”</p><p><br></p><p>I kept looking at the man.</p><p><br></p><p>Throwing me out right after dad passed away. But I wasn’t angry.</p><p><br></p><p>They had already shown their attitude towards me all these years so this… didn’t come up as a surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>What I was thinking about was my dad’s death.</p><p><br></p><p>Was it because of me?</p><p><br></p><p>Was it because he married my mom?</p><p><br></p><p>“Before leaving, can you answer a question of mine, truthfully?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>The man narrowed his eyes but nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Who killed my dad?”</p><p><br></p><p>“He was ambushed by a group of cultists from the Hagoromo Gitsune cult. They were a group with a grudge against him for killing many of their people. He took them all out before losing his life.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Was anyone from this clan directly or indirectly involved in it?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Imprudent brat!” The servant beside him shouted and got up immediately, gripping his sword by his side.</p><p><br></p><p>I however didn’t look at the servant. I was looking at the man himself.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you doubting the Clan?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Everyone except my Dad escaped….unscathed. That means they were either all cowards or they had something to do with the ambush.”</p><p><br></p><p>He narrowed his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“What would the answer even change? You are just a small fish. Can you fight against a dragon?” The man questioned, almost tauntingly.</p><p><br></p><p>“A fish can jump across the dragon’s gate and become a dragon too. Do you want to risk the wrath of a dragon?” I replied back, unmovingly.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly a weight fell over my body and I fell to my knees already. It was as if the gravity of the place had increased suddenly. It was as if the pressure was on my soul itself.</p><p><br></p><p>I saw sparks of lightning flickering across the body of the man in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>This power….</p><p><br></p><p>I was however unwilling to back down.</p><p><br></p><p>This was for my dad.</p><p><br></p><p>So I forced myself to stand up by gritting my teeth.</p><p><br></p><p>The man stared at me for a while before the pressure disappeared the next moment.</p><p><br></p><p>“The Kushihashi Clan doesn’t permit killing others of our blood… not even impure ones. That’s the only reason you still have your head on your shoulders. If I had to have someone killed, I would have chosen you instead of Hiroshi. At least he could move on with his life then. Leave.”</p><p><br></p><p>I got the answer I needed so I left the place.</p><p><br></p><p>Home was only home when we had our loved ones with us. Without that, it was just four walls and a roof on the top.</p><p><br></p><p>Without mom and dad, this place was not my home.</p><p><br></p><p>I took my belongings, basically the personal things of my parents and me and left.</p><p><br></p><p>Three days after the death of my father, I was exiled from the Kushihashi clan.</p><p><br></p><p>I was led out by the maid.</p><p><br></p><p>Apparently, dad knew something like this would happen if something happened to him someday so he made arrangements for me in advance.</p><p><br></p><p>The car arrived near the outskirts of a shrine and stopped.</p><p><br></p><p>We walked up the stairs to the shrine above. Outside the Shrine, a woman was waiting for us.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked… a lot like Shizuka, except the eye colour. She looked at me and smiled lightly.</p><p><br></p><p>The maid looked at her and spoke. “As per Hiroshi-sama’s wishes, we have left him here. From now on, he will not bear the name of Kushihashi and have no relation to our honourable clan.”</p><p><br></p><p>The look on the woman’s face changed to a stoic emotionless one. “Very well. You may leave.”</p><p><br></p><p>The maid didn’t wait for any more words and left directly.</p><p><br></p><p>“You must be Tatsuya-kun. My name is Shuri Himejima. I am a childhood friend of your father’s.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the woman. “I didn't see you at the funeral.”</p><p><br></p><p>A look of pain passed through her face before she instantly corrected it.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am not liked by the Principal Clans, at least not anymore.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at her questioningly as we walked towards the shrine.</p><p><br></p><p>She continued. “I married against the wishes of my clan. I was given a choice to choose between the two. I chose my husband and daughter.”</p><p><br></p><p>Similar to my dad.</p><p><br></p><p>“How did you know my dad? He never said anything about you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Heh! That is odd. Then again, it's understandable. We were supposed to get engaged with each other but your father left me alone. <em>Sigh</em>, poor me.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at her incredulously. </p><p><br></p><p>“Fufufufu I am just joking. While we were supposed to get engaged with each other, we were different types of people and understood that it wouldn't work between us. I wasn't lying when I said we were childhood friends. So we decided to not go through with the decisions of the clans. In fact, I was the one who introduced your mother to him and after a few years, I met my husband too. It worked out well for us.”</p><p><br></p><p>We reached the house behind the shrine where a girl who looked like a miniature version of Shuri was playing with a burly man with black hair and beard.</p><p><br></p><p>“Okaa-sama!” The girl called out as she saw us approaching. Her eyes then fell on me and she stopped in her tracks, hiding behind the man who I assumed was her father and peeked at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Akeno, this is Tatsuya-kun. You can consider him your big brother.” She went on to introduce us.</p><p><br></p><p>Her daughter was Akeno and her husband’s name was Baraqiel.</p><p><br></p><p>I wasn’t familiar with the myths of christianity but I did remember that it was the name of an angel or something.</p><p><br></p><p>They gave me a room and took the opportunity to wash up before coming out to eat.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tatsuya-kun, Hiroshi said that you are a very good artist. He even showed us your manga, is that true?”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded unsurely.</p><p><br></p><p>“I must say it is a very good manga. Even Koji-kun was full of praise towards your work. Akeno is your fan too.” I looked at the girl who was blushing at the comment. “I hope we will get to read more of it in the future.”</p><p><br></p><p>They made some small talk during dinner after which they sent their daughter to her room and we three were the only ones left in the room.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at her husband and then at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hiroshi knew that you were not blessed and that you couldn’t learn the arts of the Kushihashi Clan. If you wish to learn different types or arts, we could always assist you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I….don’t….I don’t want anything to do with the Supernatural.”</p><p><br></p><p>I really wanted nothing to do with the principal clans or their onmyoji fuckery.</p><p><br></p><p>If I needed anything, I can do it with my System.</p><p><br></p><p>The more I stay here, the more it reminds me of dad. I just want to go away.</p><p><br></p><p>“I….just want to go away from all this.”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at me sorrowfully.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Then I won’t force you. If you want to go then I can find someone to take you in. But remember, if you ever need anything, we are here to help.”</p><p><br></p><p>I bowed. “Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I spent the next month with Shuri-san and her family.</p><p><br></p><p>During this time, I completely closed myself off and started working on my manga.</p><p><br></p><p>The Himejima family helped me fully with this.</p><p><br></p><p>Shuri-san is a very supportive woman. Baraqiel, while tough looking, was quite a soft guy and Akeno was adorable.</p><p><br></p><p>They tried to cheer me up all the time but I felt bad for interrupting their family time.</p><p><br></p><p>During this time, I found something else too.</p><p><br></p><p>Brarqiel gave 50 points for every chapter he read while Shuri-san gave one point.</p><p><br></p><p>50 points was huge.</p><p><br></p><p>I got over a thousand points from him reading the chapters I had written.</p><p><br></p><p>Who exactly was this man?</p><p><br></p><p>Today, Shuri-san brought me and Akeno to the person who had agreed to adopt me.</p><p><br></p><p>She was actually very distantly related to me and a former member of the Himejima Clan who had a similar situation to me.</p><p><br></p><p>Shuri-san kept in touch with her even when she was exiled and when she told her about me, the woman agreed to let me stay there.</p><p><br></p><p>Ageha Ikuse was an old woman in her seventies who lived with her grandson who was a year younger than me. Her son and daughter-in-law live and work overseas.</p><p><br></p><p>She was getting older and thought that having me would be good for her grandson too.</p><p><br></p><p>To be honest, I wouldn’t mind living alone and with the money dad had left me, it wouldn’t be impossible either but I doubt anyone would allow a kid like me to stay alone. This was the best option that I could get.</p><p><br></p><p>We reached there by the time it was evening.</p><p><br></p><p>Shuri-san rang the bell of the apartment and an old woman opened the door.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is that you, Shuri?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oba-sama.” She bowed deeply.</p><p><br></p><p>“And this must be your daughter and is he Hiroshi’s child? What is your name dear?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Tatsuya.” I couldn’t use my last name. Those bastards had made it clear. This was not done normally for the ones exiled from the clan but I guess they went that extra step because of my questions before leaving.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tatsuya is a good name. Come in first.”</p><p><br></p><p>We went inside and in the living room was a boy with black hair and greyish eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is my grandson, Tobio. Say hello, Tobi.”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy bowed and we all got introduced to each other.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you for letting me stay here, Ageha-san.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Call me grandmother, dear. Your father used to call me Oba-sama.” She smiled and I nodded. “Anyways, with my son and daughter-in-law living and working overseas, the house is pretty empty. With you living here, things would be more lively. Even Tobi would have someone his age to play with.” She smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>We talked about a few more things, especially about my hobby of drawing manga.</p><p><br></p><p>Tobio was quite excited to read the manga and this immediately acted as an icebreaker between us.</p><p><br></p><p>I noticed another thing.</p><p><br></p><p>Grandma Ageha gave me the same points for reading each chapter as dad did.</p><p><br></p><p>Grandma Ageha decided to convert one of the spare rooms for me to use as a manga studio- my first manga studio.</p><p><br></p><p>Shuri-san took me out for one last thing before I could settle there.</p><p><br></p><p>We reached a familiar building and I looked at her in surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hiroshi really looked forward to seeing you become a mangaka. He even showed us the manuscript you had submitted to Koji-kun. He was so proud when he told us about the competition you were planning to participate in.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked down at my hands.</p><p><br></p><p>It brought back memories.</p><p><br></p><p>How much has changed in just two months?</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you still want to?” She asked softly.</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded silently.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. Let’s go. I have already made an appointment with Koji-kun.”</p><p><br></p><p>We went inside the familiar building and into the same cabin.</p><p><br></p><p>She must have noticed my mood and caressed my hair slightly when the door opened.</p><p><br></p><p>Koji-san entered the room and looked at us. His face showed a hint of sympathy when he looked at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am really sorry for your loss. The <a href=\"https://news….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">news….it</a> was a shock for me too. Hiroshi-senpai….sigh” He bowed slightly and said.</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded and thanked him softly.</p><p><br></p><p>He then turned towards Shuri-san. “Senpai, you look as pretty as always. Your husband must be a lucky man.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ara ara, and you have a silver tongue as ever, Koji-kun.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I assume you are here to enter Tatsuya’s manga for the competition?”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Great. I will have it done.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Koji-san.” I interrupted.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I apologise if I am being rude with this but what are my chances of getting serialised if I win or even get a runner’s up place in the competition?”</p><p><br></p><p>He paused for a moment and looked at me quietly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Your manga is good but if you want a serialisation spot, it might be tough considering your age. The chief would very likely think that you cannot do the job.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked down and didn’t say anything.</p><p><br></p><p>“But you don’t need to be in such a hurry. You are very young. The things you draw will only become better as time goes by.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I have completed fifteen chapters in the last month alone. I have over thirty chapters ready. I will not let any deadlines pass so please….give me a chance.”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked uncomfortable but let out a sigh. “I will talk to the editor-in-chief if you get a good spot in the competition.” He finally relented.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.” I got up and bowed deeply.</p><p><br></p><p>“I still have your manuscript. You will be submitting that one, right?” He asked, showing me the envelope.</p><p><br></p><p>The competition will start in a week.</p><p><br></p><p>“Please give me five days, no, two days. I want to brush up the drawings a bit more.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Take as much time as you want.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>We left the place and this time, unlike when we had entered, I was not feeling lost….after a very long time.</p><p><br></p><p>I had a goal again.</p><p><br></p><p>I will become the best mangaka in this world. For myself and for my dad’s last wish.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Koji Yoshida -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Please sir, give him one chance. At least talk to him once. He is a genius. An absolute genius. I have seen his work and I am sure ‘Kimetsu no Yaiba’ would do wonderfully if serialised.” He argued.</p><p><br></p><p>“The problem is not the potential of the manga, Koji. Anyone who can win the Jump Treasure Newcomer Manga Awards has talent. The problem is his age. Talent doesn’t equate to productivity. The work and stress of a mangaka’s life, do you think a ten year old will be able to bear it?” The chief argued.</p><p><br></p><p>“The boy is different, Sir. I won’t ask for anything but <a href=\"https://please….at\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">please….at</a> least meet him once. I don’t want such a budding artist to lose hope. Right now, drawing is very important for him. As for the productivity, I can assure you that he will not fail. He already has over 40 chapters of the manga ready and I have gone through them. They are all ready to be published according to my judgement. The boy draws at an incredible pace. He can draw ten chapters a month.”</p><p><br></p><p>The chief raised an eyebrow at this.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, he agreed to meet Tatsuya.</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded and rushed out to inform Shuri-senpai to bring the boy in.</p><p><br></p><p>About Tatsuya, he had mixed feelings at the start. It was true that he was doing it for Hiroshi-senpai at first but he wouldn’t accept the manuscript if the manga itself was bad. But he didn’t lie when he said that Tatsuya was an absolute genius.</p><p><br></p><p>He had visited the house where he was staying and seen him working.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy worked like he was possessed by something.</p><p><br></p><p>He knew about the line of work Hiroshi-senpai was in and had an idea about how he had passed away.</p><p><br></p><p>No doubt, Tatsuya knew it too, because it showed.</p><p><br></p><p>It all showed in the manga, in his drawings.</p><p><br></p><p>The emotions he drew in Tanjiro and the characters in the manga, the feelings….those were not something a normal ten year old could do.</p><p><br></p><p>And the result was evident.</p><p><br></p><p>Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba but Tatsuya won the grand prize in this year’s Jump Treasure Newcomer Manga Awards.</p><p><br></p><p>There have been several letters asking for serialisation of the manga and many people wanted to search for the mangaka.</p><p><br></p><p>He was putting it all into this work and so Koji decided to support him too both for his resolve and Hiroshi-senpai.</p><p><br></p><p>He informed Shuri-senpai and they decided to visit the very next day to have a conversation with the chief.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>He walked outside the chief’s office nervously.</p><p><br></p><p>Shuri-senpai and her husband had entered the office with Tatsuya while the Chief had told him to stay outside.</p><p><br></p><p>What happened next was all on them?</p><p><br></p><p>“Yoshida, why are you roaming here so nervously?” Yamahisa asked him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is this about ‘Kimetsu no Yaiba’?” The assistant editor-in-chief, Heishi-san asked and he nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Really! Who is it? That pretty lady? Is she the mangaka?” Tamahisa asked.</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t answer, still looking at the door.</p><p><br></p><p>“Kishibe-sensei wanted to remain anonymous so his name cannot be revealed.” Heishi-san lent him a helping hand and he nodded in thanks.</p><p><br></p><p>At this time, the door opened and he was called in along with Heishi-san.</p><p><br></p><p>“Kimetsu no Yaiba will be given a chance at serialisation. We will however test it first. For a one year period, it will be tested as a monthly manga and if the performance and reception remains good, we will change it to weekly.”</p><p><br></p><p>His face brightened at the reply. “Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Since you brought him here, you will be responsible for managing him. Other details of the contract have been discussed already.” Chief completed.</p><p><br></p><p>They left the room and after some instructions, they left the place too.</p><p><br></p><p>Koji followed them to collect the manuscript for the first chapter.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Tatsuya -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>It has been a year since the first chapter of my manga got published and I just got a call from Koji-san that Kimetsu no Yaiba will be a weekly manga from this point forward.</p><p><br></p><p>The editor-in-chief had kept his word.</p><p><br></p><p>The man had been almost unmoving and it had taken me literally begging him to give me a chance for him to finally come up with a compromise.</p><p><br></p><p>He did explain his reasoning to Shuri-san and Baraqiel-san. He didn’t want me to get crushed under pressure and end my manga career before it could start.</p><p><br></p><p>Fortunately, after some words from Shuri-san, he agreed to give me a chance with the monthly prints first.</p><p><br></p><p>Three months ago, the first volume of the manga was printed. It had seven chapters in it.</p><p><br></p><p>And just like that, the first quest requirement for my System upgrade was finished.</p><p><br></p><p>Not only that, even the second upgrade quest had started. I needed two hundred thousand copies sold to get the upgrade for the D Ranked System. That was a huge jump from ten thousand but with the rate I am going at, I expect it to be done in a few months.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at my Status.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Name: Tatsuya Ikuse </strong></p><p><strong>System Rank: E </strong></p><p><strong>Body:(G-57)</strong></p><p><strong>Mind:(G-46)</strong></p><p><strong>Spirit:(G-56)</strong></p><p><strong>Magic:(G-15)</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Points: 80,598 </strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Manga: Demon Slayer</strong></p><p><strong>Features Unlocked: Training Room</strong></p><p><strong>Inventory: Gacha Ticket x1</strong></p><p><strong>Shop</strong></p><p><br></p><p>My status panel looked a lot different than just a year ago last year.</p><p><br></p><p>When the System upgraded, I got a few new things.</p><p><br></p><p>The first among those was the Gacha Ticket which was the reward for the Quest.</p><p><br></p><p>It can be used to roll for a random manga which I can publish.</p><p><br></p><p>I haven’t used it yet since I couldn’t even get Demon Slayer to become a weekly manga. If I tried to force a second manga, I would surely be kicked out.</p><p><br></p><p>I will wait for a while, at least till the System upgraded. I could always draw the manga till then and find an opportunity to get it published later.</p><p><br></p><p>But this was not the only thing I got.</p><p><br></p><p>The best part was the Training Room facility.</p><p><br></p><p>It was an alternate space where I could train. The time flow between both worlds are the same but as my System Rank is upgraded, I could upgrade the Training Room too.</p><p><br></p><p>For now, it could reproduce any environment in the anime or manga I draw for me to train in. This included the tools as well except the magical ones.</p><p><br></p><p>Any injuries I sustained inside the Training Room were healed within seconds and I returned to a perfect state.</p><p><br></p><p>If I were to somehow die, I would get resurrected outside as well.</p><p><br></p><p>There were some shortcomings though.</p><p><br></p><p>Since the Time Dilation was the same as in the outer world, I had to train in secret. There was also the fact that I couldn’t bring anyone inside, which wasn’t a big problem.</p><p><br></p><p>I couldn’t escape into it either if I was being chased or attacked and the maximum amount of time I could stay inside was for twelve hours at a time after which I would be thrown outside and I would have to enter again. I could also enter the Training Room only once a day right now.</p><p><br></p><p>It also consumes 1,000 points a day to use the Training Room.</p><p><br></p><p>But even with all that, the effects it granted were awesome. It was totally worth the 1,000 points to use it.</p><p><br></p><p>As for my stats, I finally bought a few things from the System shop.</p><p><br></p><p>The thing I bought was Total Concentration Breathing. It was an E Ranked technique which cost me most of my points. Thirty Thousand Points total.</p><p><br></p><p>I plan to buy Hinokami Kagura next but that’s double the cost.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, just buying Total Concentration Breathing helped me a lot.</p><p><br></p><p>I got all knowledge on how to train it and a basic proficiency of it which I could train to a higher level. That said, the training was not easy. It was especially hard considering my current physical capabilities.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, even maintaining it for short periods of time gave me a considerable increase in strength.</p><p><br></p><p>From what I can feel, I am as strong as an adult human even at the age of eleven.</p><p><br></p><p>This would have been unimaginable in my previous life. This really is a world of magic.</p><p><br></p><p>A while after I calmed down from dad’s death, I realised that while I may not want any part in the Supernatural world, I shouldn't be unprepared in case I accidentally encountered something. I needed a bare minimum level of power.</p><p><br></p><p>This was especially true when I was becoming famous. Who knows if someone from the Supernatural side tries to come after me due to my rising popularity?</p><p><br></p><p>As the saying goes, the lion won’t spare you just because you are a vegetarian.</p><p><br></p><p>The other thing that changed was… my name.</p><p><br></p><p>Grandma Ageha offered to adopt me and give me her name. I agreed.</p><p><br><br><br></p><p>To be honest Shuri-san had wanted to offer the same but the Himejima name had no less problems associated with it than the Kushihashi name. It would have been like jumping from the frying pan and into the fire.</p><p><br></p><p>The one who was the happiest about it was Tobio as he had always wanted a sibling.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy had grown very close to me.</p><p><br></p><p>“How did it go? Did they agree?” Tobi asked me as I cut the call.</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled and nodded in reply.</p><p><br></p><p>“Great! Now your manga can be a weekly.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Congratulations, Tatsu-kun.” Grandma Ageha wished. “I will make your favourite Okonomiyaki to celebrate today.”</p><p><br></p><p>And we did just that.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Shizuka Himejima -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Shizuka?” She heard the voice of her granduncle and kept the manga under her pillow and left the room.</p><p><br></p><p>“Granduncle.” She bowed.</p><p><br></p><p>“You have done well in your training. Keep it up and you might have the potential to inherit the right to be the next host of Suzaku-sama. It's a great chance for the clan, especially after the last disappointment, there is no room for any mistakes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“...Yes granduncle.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Good. Your next training will start with the goal of making you the next host of Suzaku-sama so you better get ready.”</p><p><br></p><p>With that said, he left.</p><p><br></p><p>She closed the doors to her room and went back to her bed and brought out the manga she had been reading. </p><p><br></p><p>Demon Slayer.</p><p><br></p><p>This was the same manga as the one made by Tatsuya.</p><p><br></p><p>It had been over a year since she had heard any news of him.</p><p><br></p><p>She had been shocked to hear about Tatsuya’s father and then the fact that he had been exiled from the Kushihashi clan due to not being blessed.</p><p><br></p><p>But so what if he was not blessed?</p><p><br></p><p>She had never understood the obsession with the blessing.</p><p><br></p><p>He was still family.</p><p><br></p><p>And they drove him out at such a time.</p><p><br></p><p>The entire thing made her sad and angry at the same time.</p><p><br></p><p>Moreover, she wasn't even allowed to ask about him. Her own clan prohibited any association with him and she couldn't even find where he was on her own.</p><p><br></p><p>She had tried to enquire among her school friends and still found nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>Then suddenly, a week ago, she saw someone in her clan reading a manga. </p><p><br></p><p>Demon Slayer.</p><p><br></p><p>The art on the cover page drew her eyes. Tanjiro Kamado.</p><p><br></p><p>She had quickly borrowed the book and the story was the same. On investigating further, she found the manga was currently one of the most famous ones.</p><p><br></p><p>There was news that it was going to become a weekly manga soon.</p><p><br></p><p>On asking further she found that the author was using an alias and the company didn't reveal any information about him.</p><p><br></p><p>She became more sure that it was Tatsu. It had to be.</p><p><br></p><p>But for now, there was nothing she could do even if she found him. She was too weak for that. She had to get stronger, stronger than any of the previous inheritors of Suzaku-sama so that she can bring about a change in the rule of the Five Principal Clans. And when she did….</p><p><br></p><p>She would go and find the mangaka of Kimetsu no Yaiba….Rohan Kishibe.</p><p><br></p><p>________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x_____________________________________</p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: LuluViBritania(FF.N, SB and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Blame Jackle for pushing me to make this story.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>This story had been in my mind for a while and I finally penned it down.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>As per the request, here is a human MC story.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>And before people start flooding the comments about fuck the fallen and kill the </strong><a href=\"https://devils….no\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">devils….no</a><strong>.

Well, she didn’t use the word dumb but something like headstrong or impulsive but those are not really much different in her case here.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean imagine the audacity of this girl, coming as a part of an Archangel’s advance entourage….for a diplomatic meeting….into Devil territory and she had the fucking guts to draw her weapon on a peerage member of a Satan’s family member, without any kind of provocation, and that’s not even considering that the said member is someone who can decimate half a continent if he blew a gasket. If I didn't know better, I would have thought this girl was here from an enemy group, trying to start a war.</p><p><br></p><p>She gritted her teeth and the holy power on the sword increased as she tried to pull it away. It even stung my finger, even with the demonic power I was using to cover it.</p><p><br></p><p>Well, there is no way I am going to let this go unpunished.</p><p><br></p><p>The next instant, I used Armament and Conqueror’s Infusion and Demon Slayer Mark and clenched my fingers.</p><p><br></p><p>Crack</p><p><br></p><p>The sword shattered in her hand and her eyes widened in horror. Even the girl beside her stumbled back, staring at the cracked piece of the sword in shock.</p><p><br></p><p>“Be glad that you are here as a part of an official entourage or this would have been your head.” I glared at her.</p><p><br></p><p>Teresa held my arm at this moment. “Flinn….please”</p><p><br></p><p>I took a deep breath and calmed myself down.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl beside her continuously apologising also helped a bit.</p><p><br></p><p>And to think Teresa was actually hoping to meet this dumbass as she had been the one to take care of her world’s version.</p><p><br></p><p>What a way to ruin our first date?</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the girl and spoke. “Get lost. Tell the Church to send someone with a bit of common sense. Oh and don’t think for one moment that I will let you go with just this. The Church will be giving Teresa and me an apology for this or I’ll throw a fucking meteor on the Vatican.”</p><p><br></p><p>The other girl quickly bowed deeply. “We apologise for this.” And then she pulled the dumb girl away with her after collecting the pieces of the sword.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tch….and Onee-chan said the Church people of this world were saner.”</p><p><br></p><p>“They were. In that world, they would have never agreed to this meeting and would have found the first opportunity to ambush and attack us.” Teresa replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“I’m sorry. She….ruined our date.”</p><p><br></p><p>“She didn’t do anything. I had a wonderful time and I am sure I will do the same now. Don’t let it bother you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Why are you not angry? I am absolutely pissed off at the girl.” I asked, annoyed at her passive acceptance of the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>She smiled. “It’s because she actually did that due to her respect for her own mentor, Griselda. In her own way, she was actually being affectionate towards my counterpart. Moreover she didn’t know the exact situation. Let’s see it this way, what would you do if you found someone cloned Rias and kept her as a servant?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am not keeping you as a servant.” I argued.</p><p><br></p><p>“But that’s what they see and think. Don’t be angry. They will get around when things are revealed.”</p><p><br></p><p>I was still miffed even if her explanation was understandable.</p><p><br></p><p>Although,Teresa didn’t allow me to be glum and pulled me aside to continue our date.</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing her excited, I too let the matter go and concentrated on our date.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Irina -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Are you insane!” Nero shouted at Xenovia who was lowering her head, not even daring to meet his eyes. “You attacked the younger brother of Lucifer. Do you have any idea how much your foolishness could cost us?”</p><p><br></p><p>They had just returned to the nearest base of the Church in the town beside Kuoh and met Nero to report about the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>He took a deep breath, calming himself down and then looked at the shattered pieces of Excalibur. “And this….I will have to report everything to the Vatican.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Report what to the Vatican? About what?” A voice came from behind them as the door opened to reveal two figures.</p><p><br></p><p>One of them was a handsome young man with blond hair, green eyes, and dressed in priest clothes.</p><p><br></p><p>Dulio Gesualdo, the strongest exorcist of the Church and the wielder of the Zenith Tempest.</p><p><br></p><p>Beside him was a figure which made Xenovia stiff with fear.</p><p><br></p><p>She had blonde hair and blue eyes, just like the woman they had encountered a few hours ago.</p><p><br></p><p>Griselda Quarta, one of the strongest female exorcists of the church.</p><p><br></p><p>She narrowed her eyes looking at Xenovia’s scared look. “What is going on here?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sister Griselda….it’s like this….” Nero explained the situation, making the woman facepalm.</p><p><br></p><p>“You….sigh….” The woman didn’t even say anything.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, that was kinda bad. Good thing no one got hurt.” Dulio laughed. “I will go and apologise to them. As for the sword….well, let’s think about that when this whole meeting is over. Right now, we don’t want people to freak out about it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I….I am sorry. I just….saw her and I….” Xenovia bowed her head and whispered softly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did she really look….?” Dulio asked, quite curiously.</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded. “If I didn’t sense her to be a devil, I wouldn’t have known she was someone else. She looked, even felt exactly the same.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I asked her if they had forced her to be a devil but she said that she had chosen it on her own. I was so angry that I….”</p><p><br></p><p>“That you tried to attack her.” Sister Griselda said, tired.</p><p><br></p><p>“Actually….she had just drawn her sword when that guy….Flinn Gremory appeared behind her and she swung her sword at him in surprise.” She clarified and after hesitating for a moment continued. “He also claimed her to be his….”</p><p><br></p><p>“His what?” Sister Griselda asked.</p><p><br></p><p>She wondered how she would react to the information but seeing the waiting look of the woman, she replied nonetheless. “....his girlfriend.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Rias -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Are you getting a hang of the training?” Ria asked her as they walked back towards their room after their training.</p><p><br></p><p>Learning from her own self was….weird.</p><p><br></p><p>It was not bad. No, far from it.</p><p><br></p><p>Ria knew exactly the problem she would encounter and how to solve it. It was like having a twin who could read your mind with a look.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes….it’s tiring but I can feel myself getting close to being able to use Total Concentration Breathing at all times now. I only lose control sometimes and that’s when sparring.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, the entire goal of the technique is to be able to use it when fighting so keep up the hard work.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. Flinn really made this at such a young age?” She asked, still finding it unbelievable and she was pretty sure that she saw a slightly different look pass through Ria’s eyes as if an illusion. She was sure no one else would even have noticed it. “What happened?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Ria shook her head. “Nothing. I was just thinking of something.”</p><p><br></p><p>She held her hand reassuringly and her older self looked at her with a smile and then forward before continuing. “Yes. Flinn is a genius unlike any other. But never underestimate the amount of hard work he puts in. Even when he was six or seven years old, he would train from five in the morning, spend the mornings studying in the library and attending the classes and returning to his swordsmanship at night. And he has only increased the intensity of his training over time. Even now, he has seals on his body which increase the resistance his body experiences to do his usual activities. Imagine it like wearing weighted clothes all the time. Clothes weighing several tonnes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What?!”</p><p><br></p><p>“He continuously abuses his healing abilities to break himself and then slowly recover, to bring out the fullest extent of his devil physique.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Why? Why does he push himself so much?” She asked, not understanding. “I mean, he trained like this even before he knew about your situation, right?”</p><p><br></p><p>Ria looked towards the empty space in front of them. “He doesn’t want to be second to anyone. Flinn is extremely competitive in things he cares about. You can see it when he plays any games.” She smiled. “While he might avoid Sona, in a way, he is very similar to Sona. You should have seen him during his childhood. He was exactly like Sona right now. Always acting like a tsundere hehehehe.” She laughed and Rias herself got interested.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you have pictures of his childhood?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously. I made sure to keep the entire collection on me when we left.” Ria replied proudly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! Show me, show me, show me.” She jumped excitedly.</p><p><br></p><p>As they were talking, they reached their room and she saw Shuri standing outside and raised an eyebrow.</p><p><br></p><p>“Flinn-kun said he would be spending the night with Teresa today.” She smirked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my. I guess their date went well.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It apparently had an interruption but ended on a good note.” Shuri replied and she saw Ria narrowing her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Interruption?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Apparently an exorcist tried to attack Teresa and Flinn-kun broke her sword.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What! Is he alright?” She shouted and tried to go towards their room but Ria held her hand looking tired.</p><p><br></p><p>“They are fine or she wouldn’t be here smiling and talking to us.” Ria explained and she paused while Ria looked at Shuri. “Please don’t tell me it was her.”</p><p><br></p><p>Shuri’s smile got wider. “It was.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sigh….”</p><p><br></p><p>“What? Who are you talking about?”</p><p><br></p><p>“One of my Knights, Xenovia Quarta. Griselda Quarta in this world is her guardian.”</p><p><br></p><p>She paused at the explanation.</p><p><br></p><p>Shuri explained the entire situation and Ria decided to not escalate the matter for now. She would talk to them when they arrived.</p><p><br></p><p>“Anyways, it looks like Teresa’s wait is going to end today.” Shuri smirked and it took her a moment to understand what they were talking about and her cheeks blushed the colour of her hair at the comment.</p><p><br></p><p>“I guess we will have to sleep without him today.” Ria turned towards her and smiled as she led her back to their room.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally inside the room, they took a shower and got ready for bed.</p><p><br></p><p>Laying beside her, she broke the silence. “Can you tell me something about peerage members you had?”</p><p><br></p><p>She was always curious about the people she had recruited in her peerage.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm….alright. Let’s see, I guess I will begin with Asia….”</p><p><br></p><p>And with that she told her about the people and their stories….all except one….</p><p><br></p><p>She guessed the one about whom she didn’t want to talk but didn’t force it either.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Flinn -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I kissed Teresa’s neck as she hugged me tighter.</p><p><br></p><p>She liked it when I took control of the situation which was unlike the others.</p><p><br></p><p>With Onee-chan, it was making love. I can always feel her love and care when we have sex. With Shuri, it’s an intensely passionate competition. With Sakuya, her sass always turns me on.</p><p><br></p><p>But Teresa was unlike others.</p><p><br></p><p>She liked it when I took the lead and played with her.</p><p><br></p><p>It was as if she wanted to belong to me.</p><p><br></p><p>When thinking about it deeply, it was understandable.</p><p><br></p><p>She had lost the pillar of her life and I had become one for her and now she wanted to dedicate her everything to me.</p><p><br></p><p>But I guess even she doesn’t realise how much she wants this.</p><p><br></p><p>We separated and I looked at her.</p><p><br></p><p>She was looking at me with glazed blue eyes. I could feel her breath on my chest.</p><p><br></p><p>I held her chin and raised her face towards me and she closed her eyes, giving me her acquiescence as I took her lips. We started slow.</p><p><br></p><p>My lips slowly felt hers. They were soft.</p><p><br></p><p>She responded to my approach slowly but her movements became increasingly passionate as time went on.</p><p><br></p><p>Apart from our light makeout sessions before this, Teresa was completely inexperienced in these matters.</p><p><br></p><p>I decided to take things a bit further and licked her lips, making her go still for a second. I took advantage of her surprise and pushed my tongue into her mouth. Her eyes widened but she didn’t pull back. I took this chance to slowly explore her mouth with my tongue.</p><p><br></p><p>Over time she relaxed more and her hands wrapped around my neck, pulling me in while my own slipped down to her waist and then her ass, taking a handful of her plump behind in my palms and gave her a light squeeze.</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Ahhhh</em>.”</p><p><br></p><p>She moaned in my mouth and rubbed her body against mine even more.</p><p><br></p><p>We separated after several minutes and a bridge of saliva formed between our tongues.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at her face which had a healthy flush.</p><p><br></p><p>Before she had the time to collect herself, I picked her up in a princess carry and carried her to our bed, laying her down softly.</p><p><br></p><p>With a snap of my finger, my shirt was off and I jumped on the bed, on top of her, slowly kissing her while my hands worked on her robes.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t use magic for this because watching her reactions to everything was a treat in and of itself.</p><p><br></p><p>My hands roamed over her thighs, pushing her robes up bit by bit until it was completely off.</p><p><br></p><p>She has really amazing legs.</p><p><br></p><p>A set of pure white lingerie appeared in front of my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>By now her blush was atomic.</p><p><br></p><p>I kissed her once more on her lips and then slowly went down to her cheeks, neck, collar bone, slowly placing kisses on her chest, stomach.</p><p><br></p><p>Her breaths were getting heavier with every moment and I took a moment to see the look in her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>They were expectant.</p><p><br></p><p>She was waiting for me to reach her panties but I completely skipped it over.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a look of surprise in her eyes and I gave her a smirk at this.</p><p><br></p><p>She realised that I was teasing her and looked the other way, not meeting my eyes due to her embarrassment.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry. We will get there. But today is your first time. I am planning to make it memorable.” I said before kissing her head.</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Hmm</em>.”</p><p><br></p><p>Finally I took my time to appreciate the wonderful marvels of the world that were her thighs, placing kisses on them, slowly inching towards her core.</p><p><br></p><p>She gripped the bedsheets and bit one of her fingers to stop herself from moaning.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let your voice out. I love it.” I whispered as I pulled her towards me, raising her back with both her legs on either side of my head. My face was directly above her pantyclad core as our eyes met.</p><p><br></p><p>She smelled like jasmine.</p><p><br></p><p>This time I didn’t disappoint her and directly placed a kiss on her pussy, from above her panties.</p><p><br></p><p>She clenched her thighs gripping my head in between them almost reflexively as she moaned softly. “<em>Mmhh.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>I could see a small damp spot appear on her panties and smirked, placing more kisses on top of it, each longer than the last one.</p><p><br></p><p>I had learned several things from other partners.</p><p><br></p><p>Onee-chan had taught me how to take care of my partners while Shuri had basically competed with me to see who could tease the other more. Sakuya also had her own way to tease.</p><p><br></p><p>She would always make me say what I wanted, even when it was painfully obvious. It was her own way of asserting dominance in the relationship. In fact, she didn’t mind any <em>punishments</em> I subjected her to for her actions either and enjoyed them too.</p><p><br></p><p>All this experience made it extremely easy for me to make Teresa dance to my tune.</p><p><br></p><p>In only a few minutes, her thighs were clamping around my head and she was trying to grind herself to my face, to get more of my kisses.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked her in the eyes. “You want this, don’t you?”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded her head.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tell me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Tell me what you want.”</p><p><br></p><p>Her mouth opened in shock as she tried to understand what I had said but when she did she looked away in embarrassment.</p><p><br></p><p>“Come on. You will have to tell me what you want. I thought we could share everything with each other?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Y-y-you….Shuri was right. You really are a bully sometimes.” She complained.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, who told you to be so cute? I would never forgive myself if I didn’t explore this side of you. Now….” I placed another soft kiss on her now drenched panties. “Speak up.”</p><p><br></p><p>She bit her lips looking aggrieved but slowly whispered. “Kiss me there.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Kiss me on my….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Say the word.”</p><p><br></p><p>“...ssy.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Louder dear.”</p><p><br></p><p>“....pussy.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Atta girl.”</p><p><br></p><p>I praised her before rewarding her for her efforts as I slid her panties towards the side and revealed her glistening lower lips.</p><p><br></p><p>They had a pretty pink colour with a neatly trimmed patch of blonde hair on top. The lips were shining due to the wetness and looked extremely inviting so I didn’t delay any further and kissed it directly.</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Hmm aahhh</em>.” She moaned loudly as the grip of her thighs became tighter.</p><p><br></p><p>I lapped at her slit, while my fingers worked on the hood at the top to bring out her nub. When it appeared, I made eye contact with her before taking her clitoris into my mouth and sucking hard on it.</p><p><br></p><p>She moaned loudly as her body arched and shuddered violently as she came.</p><p><br></p><p>I let her enjoy her first orgasm for a minute.</p><p><br></p><p>She slowly calmed down and looked at me with half lidded eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“I hope you don’t think that was all. We are just beginning.” I said before diving into her core again.</p><p><br></p><p>Her eyes widened and her words were drowned in her moans.</p><p><br></p><p>I let her go after she came two more times and lay on the bed, heaving to catch her breath.</p><p><br></p><p>I lay by her side and placed a kiss on her head.</p><p><br></p><p>“How was it?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“A-ama-zing.” She replied through her breaths. “I can’t believe I waited so long. I should have done this far earlier.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will be happy to make up for lost time.”</p><p><br></p><p>With that, I pulled her on top of me, with both her legs on either side of me and her slit directly on top of my length.</p><p><br></p><p>“Your turn.” I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>She placed her hands on my chest and grinded into my length.</p><p><br></p><p>The wetness made the movements easier and I took the moment to free her breasts which had been locked all this while in her bra. The mountains of white with erect pink nubs were freed for my eyes to feast on.</p><p><br></p><p>She leaned over, her hair covering our faces like a golden curtain as she kissed me, initiating a kiss for the first time. I returned her kiss as my hands went to her thighs and helped her movements.</p><p><br></p><p>As minutes passed, she began feeling it more and her speed increased. Her juices were flowing and mixing with my own precum, making the movements easier. By now, I was hard as a rock so I decided to go to the final phase.</p><p><br></p><p>I hugged her and turned her over, getting on top of her and kissed her lips lightly. “Are you ready?”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>I placed the head of my cock at the entrance of her core and rubbed a few times before slowly easing myself in.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mmhhh” She gripped my arms tightly.</p><p><br></p><p>I continued pushing slowly as her grip on my arms increased, her nails trying to pierce my skin.</p><p><br></p><p>She was tight.</p><p><br></p><p>Incredibly so.</p><p><br></p><p>Her pussy was as if trying to resist my entry . With a final push, I was completely inside her.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“Ahhhhh ummmh.”</em> She let out a loud throaty moan as I leaned in and kissed her head lightly, giving her some time to get used to my length.</p><p><br></p><p>Moments passed and her breathing evened as did her grip on my arms.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you okay?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. You can move.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. Tell me if you want me to stop at any time.” WIth that I started to move slowly.</p><p><br></p><p>She was gripping my length, massaging me from all sides.</p><p><br></p><p>Over time, she got used to the movements.</p><p><br></p><p>Devil physique is very useful in such situations.</p><p><br></p><p>Demonic power could easily get someone used to something of this level and all that is left in the end is pleasure and this was exactly what she was feeling right now.</p><p><br></p><p>Her moans became deeper, like music to my ears as the speed of my pumping increased.</p><p><br></p><p>I leaned in and took one of her breasts inside my mouth while my other hand reached her other breast. One of her hands reached my head, pulling me into her breast even more.</p><p><br></p><p>Her movements were inexperienced but she was learning at a very fast speed. Then again, she was always a fast learner. It was just a surprise that her learning skills also extended to this area.</p><p><br></p><p>I felt my climax building so I pulled back, taking a hold of her waist.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked me in the eye and understood my intention as she raised her waist.</p><p><br></p><p>My fingers found her clit and teased her while I started pumping into her in earnest this time.</p><p><br></p><p>Soon enough, I felt my first climax of the night approaching and released it inside her with a final thrust, painting her insides white with my cum.</p><p><br></p><p>While doing so, I pinched her clit, pushing her over the edge.</p><p><br></p><p>Her entire body arched as she came once more.</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Mmmhh</em> amazing!”</p><p><br></p><p>“That was just round one, dear. As I said, I am going to make up for all the time we missed.”</p><p><br></p><p>Her reply was wrapping her legs around me and pulling me back in.</p><p><br></p><p>Lewd nuns are fucking amazing.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“I talked to Michael and they apologised for the actions of their people.” Serafall said. “Still, you broke one of their Excalibur swords with your bare hands. That’s gotta hurt their pride.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I didn’t realise it was an Excalibur Fragment. Anyways, she attacked first so it was their fault.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I never denied it.” She shrugged. “Just keep calm during today’s meeting, alright. They must be on edge due to the entire Naberius thing. We need to ease them into the situation slowly. Don’t push them away.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p><br></p><p>We were currently sitting in the meeting room of Kuoh Academy, waiting for the Fallen Angel and Heaven sides to appear.</p><p><br></p><p>Beside me was Onee-chan and my peerage members as well as Grayfia. The only one absent from my peerage was Kuroka who was out doing something for Onee-chan. Rias and her peerage members were responsible for guiding the guests inside.</p><p><br></p><p>We stood behind Sirzechs and Serafall.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ajuka didn’t come? I thought he was supposed to participate in the meeting too.” Onee-chan asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Him? He hasn’t left his lab since he figured out how to use the Shadow Clone technique. It was honestly scary watching so many of him in a single room.” Serafall said and I think I noticed her shudder towards the end of the sentence.</p><p><br></p><p>By the way, I totally agreed with her.</p><p><br></p><p>Ajuka Beelzebub with the Shadow Clone technique was scary. Extremely scary.</p><p><br></p><p>“He did look quite happy though. I don’t remember him being this excited in a long time.” Sirzechs said.</p><p><br></p><p>Well, at least he was happy.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am more worried that he will never leave his lab again.” Serafall sighed.</p><p><br></p><p>“He could always send out a clone.” Sirzechs joked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmph, at least now he will understand how annoying he can be when he has to deal with his own clones.” Serafall laughed, making others smile.</p><p><br></p><p>As we were talking, the door to the room opened and Rias and Akeno entered the room followed by three people.</p><p><br></p><p>The first one had black hair with blonde fringes and a goatee.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t need any introduction to know who he was.</p><p><br></p><p>Azazel, the governor general of the Fallen Angels and their leader.</p><p><br></p><p>It was the second person who made Shuri grip my hand lightly under the table.</p><p><br></p><p>Baraqiel.</p><p><br></p><p>I held her hand and slowly caressed the back of her hand comforting her.</p><p><br></p><p>The man himself looked at us, his eyes staying on Shuri for a while longer and I found myself having trouble controlling myself from narrowing my eyes at this.</p><p><br></p><p>Akeno however came and stood behind Shuri and glared back at the man, making him turn away.</p><p><br></p><p>The last one was a silver haired boy.</p><p><br></p><p>A <a href=\"https://devil….no\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">devil….no</a>. A half devil.</p><p><br></p><p>Was this Vali Lucifer?</p><p><br></p><p>Onee-chan had told me a bit about him.</p><p><br></p><p>He was one of the strongest people in the war against the foreign gods and it was after his death that things went completely down in the dumps.</p><p><br></p><p>He was also the teacher of Onee-chan’s son.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, they do look so much alike. If I didn’t know better I would have thought you were hiding your sister-in-law somewhere. But by Father’s name, she looks like a mirror image. Are you single, miss?” Azazel asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Sakuya didn’t reply and just gave him the stoic stare which she has mastered over the centuries.</p><p><br></p><p>“See, even her glare looks identical.” The man laughed as he took the seat on the other side of the table. “So….how did all this happen?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s wait for Michael.” Sirzechs replied, making the man raise an eyebrow. He relented nonetheless.</p><p><br></p><p>A few minutes later, the door to the room opened again and a stone-faced Kiba led a golden blonde guy with twelve golden wings and a halo into the room.</p><p><br></p><p>Archangel Michael, the current leader of Heaven.</p><p><br></p><p>He was followed by some familiar faces, faces which I hadn’t expected to see together.</p><p><br></p><p>First one was….or rather looked like a human giant hybrid.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy needed no introductions.</p><p><br></p><p>A human with that amount of holy power, there was only one I had known from both worlds.</p><p><br></p><p>Vasco Strada.</p><p><br></p><p>Behind him was the dumb girl from last time, Xenovia Quarta.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, it was the last two people who attracted my attention the most.</p><p><br></p><p>One of them was familiar, the guy I had beaten black and blue and ripped his Sacred Gear out, Dulio Gesualdo. But unlike that crazy fanatic from my last world, this one felt completely different.</p><p><br></p><p>The difference was almost as crazy.</p><p><br></p><p>It was in the eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>And talking about the differences, the last person was the one that attracted most of my attention.</p><p><br></p><p>Blonde hair, blue eyes. The nun uniform did very little to hide the figure which I am familiar with.</p><p><br></p><p>Griselda Quarta.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked exactly like my Teresa. Well….they were supposed to look alike and all but she even felt similar.</p><p><br></p><p>The two women were looking at each other with wide eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Michael took his seat on the other side of the table.</p><p><br></p><p>“Now, can we get to the matter at hand? Where did all these clones appear from? How long have you known about this?” Azazel asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“They are not clones.” Sirzechs began, making all of them pause.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh really? So my theory about the twin maids was true. That still doesn’t explain the others. I am pretty sure Shuri Himejima didn’t have any twins. Did you know of any twins of yours?” He turned towards Griselda and asked.</p><p><br></p><p>The woman looked at Teresa again and shook her head. “I don’t have any living blood relatives in this world.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs took a deep breath and started. “Maybe not in this world.”</p><p><br></p><p>The people from other factions looked at him strangely but he continued.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next hour, he told them everything about the situation, the broken and destroyed future, the time travel Onee-chan had to do and how we broke the barriers of the world to enter this world just to warn them.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone had different types of reactions to this.</p><p><br></p><p>Some were silent. Some were in disbelief while most were just not impressed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes yes, I hope you have proof of this because as cool as this plot would look in a  movie, I just don’t buy it.” Azazel spoke.</p><p><br></p><p>“As surprising as it is, I must agree with Azazel on this. I am also having a lot of difficulty believing any of this.” Michael said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, we did expect this reaction and made some preparations for this. Ajuka has already confirmed their story but I guess Ria has something for you all as well.” Sirzechs spoke as he looked at Onee-chan.</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded and got up, handing a piece of paper to Michael. “Lady Gabriel had given this to me. I don’t know what this is but she said that you would believe my story if I gave you this.”</p><p><br></p><p>The Archangel accepted the paper curiously and opened it and almost immediately, his eyes widened and the hands holding the piece of paper shook.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at Onee-chan and then back at the paper a few more times before burning the paper away with his magic. “I see. Alright I believe you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Wait? Just like that?” Azazel asked, surprised. “No more questions? No verifications?”</p><p><br></p><p>Michael shook his head. “If she has this, then it must mean that Gabriel, as the then leader of Heaven must have trusted her with her life. There is just no chance that she could get her hands on this if Gabriel didn’t trust her.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What is that?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Michael’s face looked sombre. “Nothing. It is nothing.”</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone looked at Onee-chan who shook her head too. “She didn’t tell me what it was, just that they would believe me if I gave them this.”</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing as both sides were not going to say anything more, they let this matter go.</p><p><br></p><p>Onee-chan turned towards Azazel.</p><p><br></p><p>“I assume you have a password for me too?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ida. This was the only word you told me. You said this would be enough.”</p><p><br></p><p>And damn if it wasn’t.</p><p><br></p><p>The casual look on his face disappeared almost instantly and a serious one took place. Even Micahel looked at him in surprise. “Brother….you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s enough.” Azazel stopped him from speaking any further. “Okay, I believe you.”</p><p><br></p><p>There was a period of silence in the room, no one knowing what to say next.</p><p><br></p><p>The shock on everyone’s face was palpable.</p><p><br></p><p>Michael was the one who broke the silence. “The future is truly a bleak one if we all had to go to this extent. The question still remains, what do we do next?”</p><p><br></p><p>“What else, we fight. I am not going to roll over and let those people kill or enslave us.” Azazel replied.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs nodded and so did Michael. Sirzechs continued. “We have a few plans but we will need everyone’s help to succeed with them. We need to keep everything a secret so that their spies cannot catch on to something amiss.” He went on to discuss several plans with them and they gave their own inputs.</p><p><br></p><p>“We need to establish peace between the Three Factions first or any moves we make will feel suspicious.” Serafall offered.</p><p><br></p><p>Michael nodded and so did Azazel who later turned to Vali. “And you will be changing your plans with the Khaos Brigade.”</p><p><br></p><p>The guy just scoffed. “If there are stronger enemies coming in, I don’t have to go around playing with those people.”</p><p><br></p><p>I couldn’t help but look at Onee-chan. “Is he nuts?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hush.”</p><p><br></p><p>The guy glared at me intensely.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t look at me like that. I am not into guys.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Pfft.” Azazel scoffed. “So, this is your brother from another world?” He asked Sirzechs who nodded in reply.</p><p><br></p><p>“And the rest are from his world which means they are not clones but actual counterparts of the ones we know. Shuri Himejima, Grayfia Lucifuge and Griselda Quarta.”</p><p><br></p><p>The three in question nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“I wonder what kind of world that was for you all to come here. I mean if there was a chance, we could always collaborate with them. You know, two times the hands.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That will not work.” Onee-chan shook her head. “The people of that world were too extreme. For example, someone revealed the truth about God to some children and the Church sent people to eliminate everyone….including the kids.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Lies!” Xenovia shouted accusingly but was made quiet with just a glare from her Griselda….ughh….not this again.</p><p><br></p><p>“The exorcist in question refused to do so but she was declared a rebel. The children were killed regardless and she was chased around while being called a witch who had killed the children.” She looked at the church people. “And that’s how we found our Griselda. The one who was sent to kill her was Dulio Gesualdo.”</p><p><br></p><p>The shock in their eyes was palpable.</p><p><br></p><p>Onee-chan didn’t stop but continued. “I found her because I was searching for the counterparts of my original peerage members and heard about her. The same happened with Shuri who was abandoned by both her family and the Fallen Angels. Baraqiel of that world took away their daughter at birth and never permitted her to meet her child again. By the time that Akeno grew up, she wanted nothing to do with her either. She was all alone and joined us after we convinced her for years.l” By now, I could feel the glare from Akeno even when I was not the focus.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, this girl needs to know how to separate the two worlds.</p><p><br></p><p>The target of his glare however was too much in shock to reply.</p><p><br></p><p>Onee-chan continued. “Grayfia was in a similar situation. The people of that world are vastly different from the ones in this one. They would turn around and stab us in the back at a moment’s notice.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well….that’s a no then.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So what then….”</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs took this opportunity to speak. “As Azazel stated earlier, we fight. But we also make some other backups.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! What backups?”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at Serafall who nodded and continued. “We have thought of using Flinn’s abilities to search for other worlds. For this, we will make a team and send them to explore the worlds and search for ways to help us fight our enemies or in the worst case scenario….retreat if we fail.”</p><p><br></p><p>The atmosphere became completely cold at the last statement.</p><p><br></p><p>“I had heard that your brother had a unique bloodline but to think it was this kind of power….are you sure you can do that?” Azazel turned towards me and asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I cannot control which world in general without some kind of anchor but we have some preparations for that. We can at least open the entrance to one world with certainty.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, which world?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“The world where my eyes come from?”</p><p><br></p><p>Yes….this was the story Onee-chan had thought about to explain to everyone about my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“My mother was experimented on to create a Super Devil. They fused her with the DNA for someone or something they had found, something completely unknown. She was the only survivor among many other subjects. We couldn’t find out much about what they were due to the lack of access and our need to keep our operations a success but due to the awakening of my final ability, we theorised that whoever they were, had the ability to travel through worlds. We found out that we could use the remains of their power to open a door to other worlds when we were developing the spell to travel here. There are still many things about my eyes and bloodline that I don’t know about and I am still exploring it all.”</p><p><br></p><p>The discussions were held till late. At the end of it all, Michael got up and came to us.</p><p><br></p><p>“I know my apology would not change anything but still, I would like to apologise to you for what happened to you.” He bowed in front of Teresa apologetically.</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t have to apologise. That was not you.” She shook her head. “I am happy where I am now so you don’t have to feel guilty for it.”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded and turned towards us. “Thank you, for going through so much to give us a chance to fight. I cannot insist on how much we owe you for this.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It was what I had to do. My home was at stake.” Onee-chan replied while I just nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>He smiled. “I can see why Gabriel would trust you with this. If you ever need anything in the future, you can ask us for help.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>He moved aside after that and the exorcists came in next.</p><p><br></p><p>Dulio was looking extremely guilty and profusely apologised to Teresa and after he was reassured, the dumb girl came forward and apologised as well.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, she looked like a puppy who had been kicked aside.</p><p><br></p><p>Today’s revelations must have been too much for her.</p><p><br></p><p>From the truth about God to the actual story behind Teresa leaving the girl almost broke.</p><p><br></p><p>Even my anger had cooled down a bit looking at the girl’s state which reminded me of Teresa in her early days with us.</p><p><br></p><p>I wouldn’t be surprised if she left the Church after this.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, the only reason she was even caring right now was because of Griselda holding her shoulder with a hand.</p><p><br></p><p>Onee-chan took this opportunity to step forward and hug the girl tightly for a moment before pulling back. “It’s nice to see you again, Xenovia.”</p><p><br></p><p>The girl nodded while still lost in her thoughts.</p><p><br></p><p>Onee-chan came back to my side and looked at me. “Flinn, give them a holy sword for the one you broke.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://“No….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">“No….it</a> was Xenovia’s fault for attacking you. We will ask the alchemists from Heaven to fix the sword.” Griselda denied.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s not a problem. We are going to be working together from now on. Our allies becoming stronger is a good thing. Moreover, I doubt there would be many people on our side who can use the holy swords.”</p><p><br></p><p>Teresa also looked at me with a pleading look.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, you two are too forgiving.</p><p><br></p><p>I let out a sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>SInce I hadn’t traced that sword as I was quite angry back then, I decided to make a new one for them.</p><p><br></p><p><em>‘I am the bone of my sword.’</em></p><p><br></p><p>A sword appeared in my hand.</p><p><br></p><p>It was the Durandal from the Fate world.</p><p><br></p><p>“Here. Take this. Although not as good as the original one, it is far better than the one I broke. You will know its name when you touch it. As for your broken sword, you can give it to me and I will fix it up.”</p><p><br></p><p>They looked at the sword with wonder in their eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“What sword is this? I have seen nothing of this sort and yet it feels familiar for some reason.” Michael asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s Durandal….or at least my version of the sword.” I answered.</p><p><br></p><p>The bodybuilder priest took the sword in his hand and swung it once, causing waves of wind to blow across the room.</p><p><br></p><p>“This indeed feels strong. A bit different from Durandal I am used to wielding though I don’t know why but I know it is Durandal.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s because unlike the power to cut anything, this Durandal has the trait of ‘unbreakability’ and a few more things. It’s still untested.” </p><p><br></p><p>“How interesting. I have seen Durandal and I am sure several others here have done the same but it is quite different from the original sword. Not weak. If anything, I am feeling that this one is stronger for some reason. How did you do it? A Sacred Gear? Sword Birth, no….it’s a holy sword so Blade Blacksmith?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Projection Magic. It’s an original of mine.” I ended the line of questions before they had any chance to probe.</p><p><br></p><p>“Say, as” Azazel looked at Onee-chan.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ria.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ria, yes. As Ria just said, we are allies so can we get a few of those too?”</p><p><br></p><p>….this guy is really shameless, isn’t he?</p><p><br></p><p>But we needed their help.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. I can agree to that but….you will have to do something for us in return.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I want you to help my peerage members master their Sacred Gears. Unfortunately, as much as I would like it, they are not my area of expertise.”</p><p><br></p><p>“They have Sacred Gears?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. We kinda picked them up by the road before leaving the previous world.” I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Hoh….now I am even more interested in that world. In all my life, I haven’t found any Sacred Gears lying by the road in this one.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What can I say, I am lucky that way.” I shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, which ones do you have?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Zenith Tempest, Dimension Lost, Annihilation Maker and Telos Karma.”</p><p><br></p><p>His mouth opened wide at the reveal and so did the other’s but he recovered it soon enough and closed it shut. “I see. Very well, I can work with that. In fact, I have never had the opportunity to work with those till now and there are many ideas I wanted to try.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t experiment on them. Rather help them grow stronger.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Same thing, same thing.” He waved it off.</p><p><br></p><p>No they are not.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Onee-chan and then at Sirzechs and they nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. I will make something later.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Great!”</p><p><br></p><p>At this moment, Onee-chan looked at Michael and spoke. “By the way, I have a request.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes?”</p><p><br></p><p>\"One of my….I mean Rias’ peerage members, is a survivor of the Holy Sword Project.” She saw their wince and ignored it, continuing. “I know that you have another person who has survived the experiments and is stuck in a barrier created by her own Sacred Gear. Her name is Tosca. If you don’t mind, can you have her shifted here? I can help her and Yuuto can get a chance to reunite with his friend again.”</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly a thought dawned on me. So this way Yuuto hadn’t spoken anything even when I made a holy sword in front of him. Apparently Onee-chan had a talk with him.</p><p><br></p><p>“I….I will see it done.”</p><p><br></p><p>She then turned towards Azazel. “By the way, Kokabiel is planning a rebellion. He plans to steal the rest of the Excalibur Fragments and kill Rias and Sona in Kuoh to restart the Great War again and in doing so, he is being helped by Valper Galelie. I hope you will take care of the situation.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Kokabiel? I see. No wonder he’s been making suspicious moves for a while now.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Although, please inform me when you find Valper. I think the one who deserves the right to judge him is Yuuto.”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>With that done, they left the room.</p><p><br></p><p>Baraqiel came up and apologised to Shuri too. He wanted to say more but Akeno and Shuri didn’t want to talk about anything for now so he left.</p><p><br></p><p>I can see where this girl got her ability to hold grudges from.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>The meeting ended relatively peacefully and we returned back to our homes.</p><p><br></p><p>It was decided that we would not be living in Kuoh any longer as this place still had the pervert and the supposed priest of the Spirit Gods.</p><p><br></p><p>Apparently, he had a power which could read the thoughts of girls….through their breasts….</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah….and no one wondered if something was wrong with that.</p><p><br></p><p>This was the reason Onee-chan was not telling anyone the identity of that pervert.</p><p>At least any of the younger girls.</p><p><br></p><p>We all moved back to the Underworld and plans will be made to make a school there where all of the younger generations from the three factions can gather together.</p><p><br></p><p>The Magical Girl wannabe used this opportunity to promote Sona’s School plan.</p><p><br></p><p>It would take time but till then, we were free.</p><p><br></p><p>First thing they were going to do was take care of the matters of the Khaos Brigade and the internal affairs of their own factions so that we could properly concentrate on the upcoming trouble.</p><p><br></p><p>We were also deciding on the members of the team to go to the other world.</p><p><br></p><p>It would be a mixed team from all three factions but the specifics were yet to be decided.</p><p><br></p><p>We had a period of time for us to train and get stronger for the world jump.</p><p><br></p><p>The world we were targeting also had some really dangerous beings so we needed to train more.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Michael -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“It’s unbelievable. Are you sure they were not lying, brother?” Ariel asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“The symbols in the paper which she gave me….were the password to access Heaven's system. If Gabriel trusted her enough to give her that, I think we should put our faith in her too.”</p><p><br></p><p>He was currently in a meeting with all the Seraph and above ranking Angels except Raphael. He had already discussed everything with the other three Great Seraphs and this meeting was now held to inform the rest.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone, including Gabriel, looked shocked at the revelation.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then what are we going to do next, brother?” Uriel asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“From what I have been told, there are angels in Heaven who are using the loopholes in the system to avoid falling. We need to fix those to prevent any leak of information. I have been given some information about the reforms we had made in the future, one of which included the introduction of the Brave Saints system. We will have a group of scientists work on that too. Finally, we will send a group of talented younger generations to cooperate with the kids from the other two factions and create a team to explore other worlds. Right now, these will be the list of things we need to prioritise.”</p><p><br></p><p>As they were talking, Raphael entered the place.</p><p><br></p><p>“Michael, where did you get this sword from?!” he asked, still surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm? This was made by Flinn Gremory using his original Projection Magic. Did you test it? He said it was still an experimental product and it's untested.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously I tested it. It’s beyond any sword we have in our possession. I don’t even know how he could make something like this but that’s not what’s strange. The strangest part is what’s inside it. You need to see it for yourself to know!”</p><p><br></p><p>“What?” He raised an eyebrow, as Raphael handed him the sword.</p><p><br></p><p>“Check the gem.”</p><p><br></p><p>He did exactly that and a moment later shock marred his face as he realised what this was.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at Raphael as if to confirm. “Is this?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But how can it be?” He was shocked as he tested it again to see if the first one was a mistake and received the same result again.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s what I am asking you! How could he make something like this? It should be impossible. Especially for a devil.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I….have no idea, brother.” Michael quickly thought about everything he knew about Flinn and suddenly an idea came to his mind.</p><p><br></p><p>His mother was implanted with the DNA of someone from another world which gave him his bloodline.</p><p><br></p><p>Did that have something to do with it?</p><p><br></p><p>He did say that he still didn’t know the exact powers of his bloodline and was still exploring it.</p><p><br></p><p>Could it be….?</p><p><br></p><p>“What exactly is in the sword, brother?” Uriel asked, looking at their shocked faces.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Its….Father’s Miracles.”</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: LuluViBritania(FF.N, SB and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Authors Note:</strong></p><p><strong>I am back with another chapter of The Redhead System.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>We got the hot nun finally.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Revelations were made and a shocking misunderstanding is being birthed due to a random mistake.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Flinn is going to have interesting times ahead.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br></p>",

Breathe deeply.”</p><p><br></p><p>I did.</p><p><br></p><p>“The sense of reality in this game is messing with everyone’s mind. Don’t let it catch you off guard.” Shiroe said, after finishing up.</p><p><br></p><p>A few minutes later, I was more in control, I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you. I lost control there for a moment.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No worries, dear. Such sights making you angry just proves that you are still sane.” She patted my back. “That said….this kind of scene….although unpleasant, is how things happen in the real world too. Let’s not talk about monsters, even humans do this kind of thing. And right now we are trapped in this….game with millions of such people.”</p><p><br></p><p>We looked at her surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hard times bring out the monsters in people. You should take this opportunity to strengthen your resolve. In such times, excessive anger will only be your enemy. Use it as a motivation but don’t let it rule you. If I am not wrong, this is just the first of many things you will witness. Losing your temper later on can lead to losing your life.”</p><p><br></p><p>We sat there for a few more minutes, each with our own thoughts, the atmosphere growing sombre.</p><p><br></p><p>After a while, I got up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s go. We need to complete the quest.”</p><p><br></p><p>They nodded as we decided on what to do with the hostages.</p><p><br></p><p>By the end, we decided that we will carry one person each while the last one will walk after some healing from Veena.</p><p><br></p><p>We used the Monster Repelling Pouches that Veena had prepared and carried the women on our back while I supported the last girl, helping her walk.</p><p><br></p><p>The rest of the journey was quiet.</p><p><br></p><p>None of us wanted to speak, each of us had our own thoughts in our mind.</p><p><br></p><p>I used the chance to check the rewards I had received in the dungeon.</p><p><br></p><p>Going back on the list, I saw something that took me by surprise.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Congratulations Traveller.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>You have discovered another secret!</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Reward: Goblin Slayer Class Unlocked.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Keep working hard.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Traveller.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>A Special Title given to those who complete the Hidden Quests, Man of Culture.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>+3 to all stats.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>+6% to Exp Gained.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Note: The Effect of the Title can be enhanced the more secrets the Traveller discovers in the world.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Goblin Slayer?</p><p><br></p><p>They noticed my steps pause for a moment and stopped too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you sense something?” Shiroe asked, looking around.</p><p><br></p><p>“I….unlocked a new Class.” I said, after thinking for a moment.</p><p><br></p><p>“Knight Class is unlocked already? I thought we have to take them to the castle for that.” He asked, confused.</p><p><br></p><p>“Not the Knight Class. Another one. This is called….Goblin Slayer.”</p><p><br></p><p>“....Goblin Slayer?” He asked, unsure, and then as if sensing something, his eyes widened. “A rare class. Is it a Rare Class? How did you unlock it?” He asked quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t know.” How was I supposed to tell him that this was the result of that Achievement.</p><p><br></p><p>I could only insist that I had no idea and make them think of alternatives.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. Was it because of something we did in the Quest?” he thought for a moment then shook his head. “What Tier is it?”</p><p><br></p><p>“T4.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The same as Knight? Could it be a first time completion reward or a Perfect Completion reward since we didn’t allow any Hostages to die. Anyways, let’s complete the quest and then we can check it out. Just don’t switch classes. I remember that you needed to do the Quest while using the Squire Class. It could be a bait. Do it after you complete the quest.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded and we went ahead.</p><p><br></p><p>Surprisingly, we didn’t encounter anything on our way back.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, we definitely attracted many eyes as soon as we reached the town.</p><p><br></p><p>By the time we had reached the Knight’s Academy, many people were following us from a distance but didn’t approach us.</p><p><br></p><p>I went and talked to the guard at the gate to submit my quest and they carried the hostages from there.</p><p><br></p><p>“Come with me and submit the quest.” One of them led me to the reception.</p><p><br></p><p>The Receptionist was the same one who gave me the quest, Tyra.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy who had led me there told her something and she greeted me cheerfully.</p><p><br></p><p>“Congratulations, Arthas. You completed the Quest perfectly and even saved all the missing people. You are officially a Knight from today.”</p><p><br></p><p>“There were two more people who were already dead. It looked like they had been dead for a while though.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Some people from the surrounding areas had gone missing. We will send someone to investigate those. The quest we had was to retrieve the four people you rescued, so congratulations.”</p><p><br></p><p>She brought out a badge and gave it to me.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is your identity plate. Now for your bonus,” She brought out a book and placed it in front of me. “This was posted by the family members of the Party whom you rescued. It is a Skill Book of the Skill, Parry. Use it well.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.” I thanked her.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Knight’s Badge.</strong></p><p><strong>+10 STR +10 END +10 DEX</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>T4 Class: Knight Unlocked</strong></p><p><br></p><p>To test the class, I changed to the newly unlocked Knight Class.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Congratulations on being the first one from your Country to advance to a 4th Tier Class.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Title Gained</strong></p><p><strong>One Among Ten Thousand</strong></p><p><strong>+30% increased Exp Gain.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Keep doing your best, Traveller.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Sure enough, there it was.</p><p><br></p><p>A 36% increase in EXP Gain was a lot but as classes branch more and more, I would need to level up more than one class to unlock higher level ones and I can lose my advantage in the long run.</p><p><br></p><p>Moreover, this message says, first in the Country. Which means there would be others too, in different countries.</p><p><br></p><p>Even now, they must be rushing forward to get the first place for the next class change.</p><p><br></p><p>I wonder how long I can maintain my advantage?</p><p><br></p><p>Since the quest was completed, I took a moment to check the information about Class Advancements for the Knight Class.</p><p><br></p><p>I went directly back home after that.</p><p><br></p><p>Both Veena and Shiroe were waiting there for me.</p><p><br></p><p>They had returned ahead of time to avoid the crowd following us.</p><p><br></p><p>I changed into my cloaks and sneaked back in.</p><p><br></p><p>“So how was it?” Shiroe asked as soon as he opened the door for me to enter.</p><p><br></p><p>I removed my cloak. “I got it. There was also a bonus Skill Book for a perfect completion.”</p><p><br></p><p>I replied as I sat down on the couch.</p><p><br></p><p>“A Skill Book?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>This was the first Skill Book I had encountered so I guess those were rare.</p><p><br></p><p>I just showed him the book.</p><p><br></p><p>“What Skill is this?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Parry.” I replied as Veena poured me some lemonade. “Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>He returned the book back to me. “Then you get the Skill.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded and kept the Skill Book in my inventory.</p><p><br></p><p>Next, I went on to explain to them about what I had found out from the Knight Academy.</p><p><br></p><p>There were Sword Knight and Shield Knight, depending on which Skill the Knight was more proficient in when they took the Advancement Test.</p><p><br></p><p>If their Sword Proficiency was more, they became a Sword Knight and if their Shield Proficiency was more, they became a Shield Knight.</p><p><br></p><p>In the rare case however, if they had equal Proficiency in both Skills, they got an option to choose.</p><p><br></p><p>In an even rarer case, if they had both Skills Maxed out before taking the Quest, they get the Lord Knight Class.</p><p><br></p><p>One can already guess which class was the best among the three.</p><p><br></p><p>“Say what one might about this Gamemaster person, but he was quite detailed when making this game. Even if we hadn’t been….trapped here as we are, I could still see myself playing this game rigorously.” Shiroe commented lightly.</p><p><br></p><p>He was not wrong either.</p><p><br></p><p>The game was indeed a marvel.</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, did you find out about the Goblin Slayer Class?” He asked, suddenly remembering something.</p><p><br></p><p>I shook my head. “No. There was no information about it in the records.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Really? A completely new class then. A Rare Class. It might be the first Rare Class we have encountered in the Game so far. Do you really have no clue on how you unlocked the Class?” He asked again.</p><p><br></p><p>I shook my head. “None.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That makes it so hard to narrow down. If we knew how to get this Class, we could have totally sold the information and made it rich.” He sighed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sorry. I will try to think about anything that might be useful.” I lied again.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, which Class do you think I should go for for my T5 Advancement? Lord Knight? Or do we research it more?”</p><p><br></p><p>“We research obviously but….” He paused for a moment and looked at the two of us. “I think you should go for the Goblin Slayer Class.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, listen to me.” He explained. “Such Classes will always have advantages over other Classes and we never know what Classes it can unlock when levelled up completely. Knight Class is still mostly known and we don’t know if there would be an easy route to T8 or even T9 Advancements. Hell, we don’t even know if we could get an easy T6 Advancement for it. Goblin Slayer on the other hand is completely in the unknown. Even if we get nothing out of it, just selling the information about the Details of the Class and its skills will be enough to compensate us for the hard work.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm….makes sense.” Veena agreed too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, if that’s what you think is good.” I agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>“We need to address another thing.” Shiroe began when the discussion of the Class selection was over.</p><p><br></p><p>, “Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“We might need to recruit some more members to our team soon.” He said quite seriously.</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing that we were paying attention to him, he continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“The dungeon made me realise that while our three man party is good and can probably handle such dungeons, going forward, three people is just too little. For starters we need another frontliner, preferably a tank and someone who can do AoE damage, a mage probably and finally a Healer. We definitely need a good main healer.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But aren’t you planning to become a mage yourself?” Veena asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am more of a control type than a damage type.” He shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>“So a mage, tank and a healer.” I concluded.</p><p><br></p><p>“For starters….we will need to get others too. Several DPS, Support Classes and a sub healer for the final team.” He confirmed.</p><p><br></p><p>“As long as they have decent personalities, I don’t have any problems. If that takes us a bit of time, I’d rather wait than take someone untrustworthy with us.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Right. That’s why I suggested this early on. We are still in the starting stages of development so we have some time on our hands.”</p><p><br></p><p>“How many members do you think we will need?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“That depends. What exactly are we aiming for? What exactly is the focus of our guild? Are we going to be explorers and raiders or are we looking to be a casual guild? What scale do we want? Do we want a guild of a dozen highly skilled and well equipped members or do we want a large guild with elaborate management or just a regular guild. Everything has its advantages and disadvantages.” He explained.</p><p><br></p><p>This led us to think.</p><p><br></p><p>I knew a thing or two about managing a business due to the influence of my parents. It might have been due to my personality which was more mature than other kids of my age, that they started teaching me a thing or two from the start. That said, I wasn’t sure what I would do about recruitment.</p><p><br></p><p>“Can you explain a few advantages and disadvantages of both systems?” Venna asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe nodded and started. “Small Guilds means less members, a small number of people which in turn means more trust and a greater degree of teamwork and understanding between the members. Management will be relatively simple. The rules are lax since everyone is basically friends. Also, since the levels of all members will be more or less similar, it's easier to move from one place to another. The downsides are that we might not be able to take large scale quests. We will need to choose the members very carefully so as to balance the team and in case someone leaves or….” He paused.</p><p><br></p><p>We looked at him and he took a deep breath and continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“In case someone leaves or….dies, we would need to train more members to take their place and it would leave the team completely unbalanced. There are other things too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What about the big guilds?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Spending power. The big guilds will have an enormous spending power. Their large numbers will mean that they can always have enough members to grind. They can occupy areas of maps completely for private use and fighting them will be hard. After all, numbers do <a href=\"https://matter….at\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">matter….at</a> least in the starting levels. They command a massive influence in the game. They can have their own production side which produces potions and weapons and with that many people farming, the raw materials for the production side is never low. The downside is that management is a terrible pain in the ass.” He sighed. “The rules of the big guild are stricter and there are many restrictions on the members.”</p><p><br></p><p>He went on to explain several things.</p><p><br></p><p>“Have you….I mean were you in any guilds?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“In my last game?” He asked and I nodded. “Well, a few. Generally small guilds. I was more of an independent player. We did have a group of friends from different guilds who you used to gather together and clear difficult raids but….we never formed a formal guild.” He had a smile on his face when he said this as if reminiscing about those times.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Veena. “So, what do you think we should do?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm….both sides have advantages we cannot deny. Then, how about this. We find good players first. Skilled and trustworthy. We form a team and level up to get a significant advantage over others. These members will form the core of our guild, the ones who will concentrate on levelling and clearing the game. Then we invite smaller teams to join us and expand. Let’s see it this way. This is a place where anyone can work slowly and become extremely strong. I am sure that with your T4 Class, you can take down a dozen T3 players in just a matter of months. Weaker players will always be attracted to such power. Groups will form in this way.”</p><p><br></p><p>We looked at her confused and she continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“Not all players are fighters, Arthas. People like us….are rare. If the danger of dying is as real as we think it is, not many players will be daring to risk it. You don’t realise it but among over three thousand players, only a few dozen have reached this town even now and most of them are not even T3. By this point, most players have just accepted their reality and yet only a few have the courage to fight forward. That said, everyone has their uses.”</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe seemed to have understood something and had a look of realisation while Veena continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“We target those players who don’t want to risk levelling up in dangerous places. The production classes. They are not as strong as fighter classes and will obviously be exploited if they have no support. This will cause them to gather around stronger players for protection. We target them first. They might not have raw power but controlling the economy is a great power in itself. Money will allow us to keep our advantage over others as well as train new members.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So a big guild.” Shiroe answered.</p><p><br></p><p>“More like an alliance of sorts.” She explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“But the question still remains. Would we be able to maintain such a guild?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I happen to have some experience in managing and recruiting people.” She answered.</p><p><br></p><p>She always did seem like that type to be honest.</p><p><br></p><p>“Very well. If you all don’t have any problems, I don’t mind either. Arthas?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t mind either.” I shook my head.</p><p><br></p><p>“Great. Then we look for potential teammates. I will keep an eye out for other production class people.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That only leaves us with one last question.” The two of them looked at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“A bard is a no go. I can’t sing to save my life.” I denied.</p><p><br></p><p>“A musician is also good.” Veena said.</p><p><br></p><p>I did have experience in playing a piano but I don’t see myself doing it.</p><p><br></p><p>What Shiroe wanted to discuss was a subclass for me. Although, we were having a bit of a problem in doing so.</p><p><br></p><p>We wanted something which would keep me from killing and exploring to help me calm down my mind so our choices were cut in half. </p><p><br></p><p>The waiter came and kept three mugs of his honey mead on a table in front of us before coming to us and taking our order.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, how about a blacksmith? We don’t have one in our team and weapons and armour do take a lot of money to make.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Blacksmithing is quite hard in this game. We need to practise a lot and it will take a lot of time away from levelling.” I argued. I didn’t want to give away my advantage in levels.</p><p><br></p><p>“What we want is something that will take your mind off of things, something that you enjoy. Perhaps you can try out some hobbies and we can think of some classes related to those.” Veena suggested.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.” The idea sounded good. “Alright, let’s go with that.”</p><p><br></p><p>I did have a hobby.</p><p><br></p><p>A very odd one.</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“Calligraphy?” Shiroe asked again as we walked towards our destination.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why? Is there anything wrong with Calligraphy?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No….there’s nothing wrong per say. I just didn’t think you were the type to have such a hobby.”</p><p><br></p><p>“My grandpa had gifted me a set on my fifth birthday. I liked doing calligraphy in my free time. It helped me focus.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Calligraphy would mean a Scribe class. You already have the Villager Class levelled up. I needed to go to the Head of the Village but here we need to go to the Mayor’s office or the Scholar’s Academy.”</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s exactly where we were headed towards.</p><p><br></p><p>When we figured out what I wanted, Shiroe led me to get the Class while Veena went back home to practise her own Herbalist Class Skills.</p><p><br></p><p>The process was easier than I thought.</p><p><br></p><p>They offered the Class to any maxed level Villager.</p><p><br></p><p>After that we bought a ton of materials for me to practise Calligraphy. Shiroe told me that he copied several books to level up his Class Skills and even sold them later on.</p><p><br></p><p>In this place, there was no printing press. All the books were written by hand and copied by Scribes. The Academy even offered quests for it.</p><p><br></p><p>By the time we returned, it was late night. Shiroe separated from me and went to his own home.</p><p><br></p><p>He had found a small place to rent nearby. The place was not as good as ours. It didn’t have a bath and had only one small room but on the plus side, it had a lower rent, allowing him to easily rent it out.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Kuroka -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure you both want to do this, Kuroka, Arthur?” Vali asked her once more.</p><p><br></p><p>She took a deep breath and answered. “Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>Arthur was just his usual stoic self and nodded, his eyes never leaving the bed where Ley Fay lay, unconscious, that abomination of a gaming helmet on her head.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka remembered that the girl had been extremely excited about the first VRMMORPG in the world and couldn’t wait to try it and how happy she was when she finally got the gaming helmet.</p><p><br></p><p>Who could have thought….?</p><p><br></p><p>And as if this was just the beginning, bad news just kept coming.</p><p><br></p><p>Vali came with the information that even her own sister, Shirone was in a similar situation right now, along with the little sister of the new Lucifer and her other fellow peerage members.</p><p><br></p><p>She had almost rushed and invaded the Gremory Mansion had Vali not stopped her by force….not that going there would have helped.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone had seen how the Game Master dealt with anyone trying to interfere with his game. Not only would she kill herself, she would also endanger her sister’s life by going there by herself.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka was at her wit’s end on what to do.</p><p><br></p><p>The next piece of information he brought gave her some hope.</p><p><br></p><p>He told her about how the Satans were planning to send people inside the game and how it was also approved by the Game Master.</p><p><br></p><p>All they needed was to order a VR set from the official website and they could go inside the game and rescue everyone by completing the game.</p><p><br></p><p>He became silent for a moment before speaking. “Then take care. We will make sure your body is protected here.”</p><p><br></p><p>They had offered help but she wasn’t sure what she would face inside the game and if their strengths would even be of any use inside the virtual world so she didn’t accept their help.</p><p><br></p><p>Ultimately, only three people were going to go inside the game.</p><p><br></p><p>Her, Arthur and Eliane Westcott, Arthur’s maid and lover. She was the descendant of one of the founders of the Golden Dawn Magician Organisation as well as Ley Fay’s maid and magic tutor. She had become a maid in the service of thePendragon family and was the one who took care of Ley Fay all this time.</p><p><br></p><p>Her relationship with Arthur was not accepted due to the difference in their statuses so Arthur had left his house so as to not implicate her due to their relationship.</p><p><br></p><p>When she found out about Ley Fay’s situation and that Arthur was planning to go inside the game, she had pleaded to accompany them.</p><p><br></p><p>She was also a master magician with enough skill for other members of the team to recognise her.</p><p><br></p><p>After all, this was the person who had trained Ley Fay into the excellent Magician she was today.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at Vali and Bikou, the latter waving her goodbye as she closed her eyes and darkness overtook her.</p><p><br></p><p>The game started and she was asked to choose her name. She chose her character name as Kuroneko and logged in.</p><p><br></p><p>When her eyes opened again, she found herself standing in the middle of what looked to be a village.</p><p><br></p><p>She was taken aback for a moment as the surroundings looked too real for it to be a virtual world.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps the only thing which prevented her from thinking that she had been teleported to a different world altogether were the two bars at the corner of her vision.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked towards the side and saw her own reflection in a window pane.</p><p><br></p><p>It was almost the same as her usual appearance except the absence of her Cat ears and tails. She was dressed in coarse faded clothes which wouldn’t look out of place in a mediaeval villager.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next few minutes, she checked several functions of the system to get familiar with everything and then looked around to check the place.</p><p><br></p><p>Her appearance attracted the eyes of quite a few players. They stared at her wide eyed but didn’t approach her, instead choosing to stare at her from a distance.</p><p><br></p><p>She wondered what was up with those looks and went ahead and talked to a few of them.</p><p><br></p><p>One of them, a woman who looked to be in her forties, was helpful enough to explain everything to her.</p><p><br></p><p>What she found out next sent shivers down her spine and increased her worries even more as she thought of her sister’s safety.</p><p><br></p><p>Anyone who dies in the game, died for real.</p><p><br></p><p>Then there was the thing about time passing quickly inside the game.</p><p><br></p><p>What had looked to be less than a week from the outside, was already more than three months in the game world.</p><p><br></p><p>Was Shirone already?</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>Shirone would be safe.</p><p><br></p><p>She wasn’t weak.</p><p><br></p><p>….at present, Kuroka could only console herself with the words.</p><p><br></p><p>She had to grow stronger as soon as possible and find her sister.</p><p><br></p><p>She went around and asked for a few things and made plans to level up faster.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>Two days later, Kuroka found some problems.</p><p><br></p><p>First, she wasn’t even remotely near her full power. To gain power, she needed to level up.</p><p><br></p><p>She had already read everything she could about the game and knew what  she needed to know about the class system.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, without her strength, hunting was difficult. Hunting around the village borders was too slow.</p><p><br></p><p>There were several people who were in the starting village, still hunting to get a T2 Job Class and they often hunted the weaker prey near the borders of the starting village. And with the spawn time being what it was, it made levelling up very difficult for the people.</p><p><br></p><p>If she wanted to level up faster, she had to use some other means.</p><p><br></p><p>What she had found out was that this game offered a large degree of freedom in the actions of a person. She was about to test out just how much that freedom was.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next week, she spent all her time hunting. Especially at nights, when there were fewer people near the outer parts of the town.</p><p><br></p><p>The level of monsters also increased slightly but that was only for the better.</p><p><br></p><p>She might have lost her power but her experience was every bit as useful as it was in the real world.</p><p><br></p><p>When they were younger, she had survived in the Underworld slums, protecting and feeding her sister all by herself.</p><p><br></p><p>Hunting and escaping others is not difficult for her.</p><p><br></p><p>She found out that she could use poison to hunt and used her money to buy poison from the Village Shop. It cost her a lot but she could manage.</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t spend her time in the village inn and that saved her a few extra bucks.</p><p><br></p><p>After getting poison, she could easily hunt higher level animals, although she had to hide and wait for them to slowly reach a near death state where she could just end them with a single strike.</p><p><br></p><p>It was an exhaustingly slow process but it did give her more experience than anything she could get while hunting near the village borders.</p><p><br></p><p>Once in a while she saw a few players coming to the forest but they never did so at nights and they were almost always in teams so it was easy to avoid them.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“N-no….please forgive me. I won’t do that ever again.” She looked at the guy begging her feet.</p><p><br></p><p>Two others beside him were too scared to even speak.</p><p><br></p><p>He was a level 8 Villager while the other two were level 7. They had followed her while she went out to hunt.</p><p><br></p><p>She could smell the scent of alcohol from them even from this distance, although it was getting replaced by the scent of blood every second.</p><p><br></p><p>Just outside the village, she sensed someone approach her and quickly placed a trap for them.</p><p><br></p><p>She was still only level 6 while even their weakest member was higher than her in level. Even their equipment was better than hers but she noticed that they were obviously amateurs. It was evident that they had lost their sense in their drunken state and were intending to assault her.</p><p><br></p><p>Too bad they were no match for her experience. She had survived in the Underworld when she was a child. Taking care of these types of people was nothing for her.</p><p><br></p><p>Although, it did take her all her paralytic powder to bring them down.<br><br>She had spent everything to prepare to hunt bigger prey but had to use it on them.</p><p><br></p><p>For people like them, she had no mercy.</p><p><br></p><p>“Plea-se I will do anything. Money. Yes. I have gold. Here.” He threw out gold from inventory at her feet which was followed by equipment and other things.</p><p><br></p><p>She eyed them and raised an eyebrow.</p><p><br></p><p>Well, who was she to deny such a harvest.</p><p><br></p><p>She was already short on money as it is.</p><p><br></p><p>Without another word, she stored everything in her inventory.</p><p><br></p><p>The game only had a small chance to drop the equipment of the players when they died or were killed but she suddenly found out that there were no limitations on this kind of thing. A loophole? Then again, it was understandable. After all, she didn’t rob them. They offered the items themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>His followers looked at her keeping everything in her inventory and the guy himself smiled, thinking he was forgiven.</p><p><br></p><p>She let him think so while she looked at the other two, drawing her newly gained dagger and slightly narrowing her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“W-we have gold too. Yess. Take it. But please let us go.” The two followers begged and brought out their own gold and laid it in front of her.</p><p><br></p><p>She took everything and kept it into her inventory and looked at them once again and then in a flash, she stabbed the eye of one of the followers.</p><p><br></p><p>A few stabs in his eyes and he was down.</p><p><br></p><p>The other two looked at her in horror.</p><p><br></p><p>“No…..I already gave you everything I had. You said you would let me go….” The other follower shouted.</p><p><br></p><p>“I said so? When? I am sure I would have remembered making such a promise. Why is it that I don’t recall something like that?” She replied before slashing both their necks.</p><p><br></p><p>There was no way she was going to leave them alive after what they were planning.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. We can make a custom order for you at that price.” The owner of the shop told her. “Unfortunately I am busy with other orders so I can only let my apprentice work on it. Are you okay with that?”</p><p><br></p><p>Apprentice?</p><p><br></p><p>She raised her eyebrow.</p><p><br></p><p>“I would like to meet your apprentice first.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm….that’s tricky. You see, my apprentice is a bit of a wimp, always staying holed up in the workshop and never going out, but I am sure I can work it out. I will arrange a meeting. The Blacksmith Class Advancement is going to need a test and a Custom Order of this scale is just the thing we need.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man told her to wait and went behind the door at the back of his shop and into his workshop.</p><p><br></p><p>She was pretty sure she heard a scream from a girl or something and her hand instinctively went to her new dagger, preparing to defend herself from any sudden attacks.</p><p><br></p><p>“Get in.” The shopkeeper's voice came from within.</p><p><br></p><p>She hesitated a moment but remembered that the village was a safe zone and she wouldn’t be hurt inside so she resheathed her dagger and went ahead.</p><p><br></p><p>Inside the workshop, the shopkeeper was standing and behind him was a face she didn’t expect to see here.</p><p><br></p><p>Dressed in clothes which wouldn’t look off on a girl, the blonde haired kid who was obviously a boy stared at her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Aren’t you that Dhampir from Rias Gremory’s peerage, Shirone’s friend?”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy’s eyes widened at her words.</p><p><br></p><p>“Y-y-you know Buchou?” He asked hesitantly.</p><p><br></p><p>“You could say that. I do keep tabs on her. After all, my cute sister is a part of her peerage.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Your sister?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah….you call her Koneko.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Koneko-chan’s sister? But isn’t she….” His eyes widened as he hid behind the shopkeeper again. “Hiiiiiiiiiiii don’t eat meeeeeeeeeeeee!”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Venelana Gremory -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She watched as Arthas hacked down another goblin with his sword before trampling on the skull of the beast, crushing it completely.</p><p><br></p><p>Goblin Slayer.</p><p><br></p><p>As the name suggested, it was a class which excelled in killing Goblins.</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t even realise that there could be a profession solely to kill Goblins. Then again, there was a profession to kill pests so how was this any different?</p><p><br></p><p>From a technical standpoint, the Goblin Slayer Class was a mixture of a Squire, Hunter and a Thief. It was a hybrid Class of sorts, or at least that’s what Shiroe had said.</p><p><br></p><p>With it, Arthas could use bows, swords, daggers and traps, all the while covered in plate armour like a Knight. Its stat gains were lower than a Knight’s but not by much but the sheer diversity of skills it offered more than made up for it.</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, he never had any problem with stats, being the highest levelled one in the team.</p><p><br></p><p>What she was worried about was his anger at the Goblins.</p><p><br></p><p>How much of it was due to his new Class and how much is due to that day.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe had noticed it too but hadn’t realised the severity of the situation clearly. In fact, he himself was struggling to cope up with everything.</p><p><br></p><p>Arthas is a very kind boy with a great sense of justice.</p><p><br></p><p>She had seen it on the first day itself when she had met him the first time.</p><p><br></p><p>He could leave whenever he wanted and could do so easily but he fought to protect her honour, even when he was scared of killing for the first time.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps he himself doesn’t realise it but it was the main reason which attracted her to make a team with him.</p><p><br></p><p>Now though, this very thing was becoming an unnecessary burden for him.</p><p><br></p><p>It was especially so when everyone was trapped in this….game, where the limits of their mental fortitude were tested every day. One could easily forget the difference between reality and fiction here.</p><p><br></p><p>It was very easy for someone to channel their repressed fears and frustrations into hating something. Such kind of hate can slowly change people, make them more cruel, more vicious and self centred.</p><p><br></p><p>The dungeon with the goblins appears to have had a very deep effect on him.</p><p><br></p><p>Her words did help him calm down but she knew that he was not completely alright.</p><p><br></p><p>He had stayed awake the whole night on the day they had completed the quest.</p><p><br></p><p>Even now, after almost one week had passed, he still had trouble sleeping sometimes. There were dark circles under his eyes even now.</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t want him to break down due to this.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the last few months, she had come to appreciate and even cherish his companionship and she didn’t want to see anything bad happen to him.</p><p><br></p><p>They cleared out the outskirts of the goblin establishment.</p><p><br></p><p>It was their quest this time.</p><p><br></p><p>They had to completely clear out the whole Goblin establishment near Llyne and bring an end to this menace.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will check out the buildings.” Arthas said as he slowly went in and threw a smoke pouch inside one of the huts to smoke out anyone who was hiding there.</p><p><br></p><p>What they were not expecting was a coughing sound….a human.</p><p><br></p><p>Arthas looked at Shiroe and then at her and nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>They quickly took positions behind his back, ready to attack anyone at a moment’s notice while Arthas prepared himself and kicked the door of the hut open in one kick.</p><p><br></p><p>The door flew off its hinges and the scene behind was revealed.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a scene reminding them of the day of the quest.</p><p><br></p><p>Naked women with swollen bellies, laying on the ground with lifeless looking eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>This time however they were truly dead and gone.</p><p><br></p><p>Parts of their bodies were eaten up, the stench of the dead filling the whole place as soon as the door was opened.</p><p><br></p><p>Arthas froze for a moment and she quickly went beside him and put a hand on his shoulder. “Are you alright?”</p><p><br></p><p>“....hmm. Yes….yes, I am alright.” He shook his head and went ahead to check other rooms while they checked the house for any loot.</p><p><br></p><p>For the rest of the day, Arthas looked a bit lost in his thoughts whenever they were not hunting.</p><p><br></p><p>They returned back to the town by the time the sun was setting.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe separated and went ahead to order new equipment.</p><p><br></p><p>He was nearing the level cap for the Scholar Class.</p><p><br></p><p>She herself was near the level cap for her Class but her equipment was already better than most so they had decided to save more and get her something better after she got a T4 Class.</p><p><br></p><p>They got cleaned up after reaching their home, taking turns to bathe.</p><p><br></p><p>Unlike other days however, she saw that he was still lost in his thoughts.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the sight of her in a wet towel which would normally make him flustered didn’t make him break out of his reverie. Sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>They had a simple meal and Arthas went ahead to work on his Scribe Class.</p><p><br></p><p>Although she was planning to talk to him, she decided to do it later. Calligraphy did help Arthas relax so she decided to let him take his time and retired to bed herself.</p><p><br></p><p>Today’s quest was long and exhausting and she needed her rest too.</p><p><br></p><p>It was late at night when she was awakened from her sleep.</p><p><br></p><p>She walked to the kitchen to get a glass of water and noticed that the light in the hall was still bright.</p><p><br></p><p>Opening the door, she saw Arthas sitting on the chair, staring blankly in space.</p><p><br></p><p>“Arthas?”</p><p><br></p><p>He was shaken awake by her voice and looked at her for a moment before speaking. “Yes?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you alright?” She asked, walking towards him.</p><p><br></p><p>She noticed that his eyes were red and the dark circles under his eyes were more prominent. She took a seat beside him quietly, waiting for him to speak.</p><p><br></p><p>There were a few minutes of quiet before he spoke.</p><p><br></p><p>“I….see their faces every time I try to close my eyes.” He spoke after some time. “Those women….they turn from happy living people to the corpses we saw during the day.”</p><p><br></p><p>He took a deep breath.</p><p><br></p><p>“And on top of those corpses, I see the goblins, laughing, sneering and playing around with them….even in death.”</p><p><br></p><p>He hesitated for a moment. “But the worst part is when I see real people in the same situation. Mother, my relatives….you, the faces of those women change and I wake up everytime I try to sleep. I….haven’t been able to sleep properly in days.”</p><p><br></p><p>She pulled him in for a hug and lightly caressed his hair.</p><p><br></p><p>He didn't reject it either, wrapping his arms around her.</p><p><br></p><p>After a few minutes, she separated from him and held his hand.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at her confused.</p><p><br></p><p>“Come with me.” With just those words, she pulled him along to her room. “I have been feeling a bit lonely sleeping alone all this time. Accompany me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?” Despite his state, he looked surprised but she didn't give him any chance to deny as she pulled him into the bed and hugged the boy close to her chest.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked totally caught off guard at the sudden development but a moment later he let out a breath and returned her hug, closing his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good boy.” She caressed his hair lightly for a few minutes as she felt his breath become even and then he drifted off to sleep.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Sirzechs -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Is this everyone?” He asked as he looked at the group of people gathered in front of him.</p><p><br></p><p>Ajuka nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. They were given a full rundown of the situation. Their task will be to complete the game and rescue the people trapped inside. We have already provided everyone with a list. Each member they rescue will increase their reward and the ones to complete the game will get a reward granted by the Three Factions together. All of them have agreed voluntarily to join the mission. Should anything happen to them, their families will be compensated for the next three generations. Most of them are people who have their own family members trapped inside the game or have debts or are people who have had injuries and had to leave their normal lives due to it….and some of them are criminals who wish to be pardoned. Some of them wish to achieve a high rank in the underworld.”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded. “ A Rank of upto High Class will be rewarded to anyone who rescues anyone from the list and Ultimate Class to anyone who completes the game.” He promised.</p><p><br></p><p>“We will also offer them a reward from our side.” Michael came forward and added.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well….we will throw in something from our side as well.” Azazel added.</p><p><br></p><p>They had ordered over two thousand nerve gears but due to the shortage of time, only five hundred people were gathered within the week.</p><p><br></p><p>They plan to send four batches of five hundred people inside to allow the ones going ahead to make some progress while the later ones arrive.</p><p><br></p><p>Many people were trapped inside the game even among the Supernatural factions. This included not only the members of the Three Factions but also some others from different factions.</p><p><br></p><p>He had sent messages to all the other pantheons to inform them about the deal with the Game Master in the hopes that they would also send some people inside the game to rescue others.</p><p><br></p><p>There had been no reply till now due to the short amount of time passing.</p><p><br></p><p>Most of them were hesitating to make any moves after seeing the retaliation of the Game Master against the Devil Race due to the actions of Rizevim.</p><p><br></p><p>He hoped that the successful entry of the first batch of people inside the game would also give them hope and they would lend a hand to the cause.</p><p><br></p><p>“Lord Lucifer.” He heard a voice beside him and looked to the side to see his sister’s knight, kneeling before him. “Please….please allow me to go inside to rescue others.” He begged.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy had been feeling guilty since the day he found out about what had happened.</p><p><br></p><p>He had been out due to a contract and had escaped the fate of being trapped inside the game. The others hadn't been so fortunate.</p><p><br></p><p>This had been eating away at the boy.</p><p><br></p><p>Again, when knowing the boy’s past, it was understandable.</p><p><br></p><p>Survivor’s guilt.</p><p><br></p><p>He had once lost all his friends due to the actions of a madman and once more, the same thing was being repeated with him.</p><p><br></p><p>It must be even harder on the boy.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, he, in his right conscience, couldn’t allow him to do so.</p><p><br></p><p>He knew how much his sister cared for her peerage members. Losing even one of them would leave her devastated.</p><p><br></p><p>The rest of her peerage is already trapped inside. Now, if he were to send even the last one in such a dangerous situation, she would never forgive him when she came out.</p><p><br></p><p>He let out a sigh and patted the boy’s shoulder.</p><p><br></p><p>“They need you here, Yuuto-kun. I promise nothing will happen to them. I will….we will save them all.”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy tried to argue but he shook his head.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tell me, Yuuto-kun, do you think Rias would ever forgive any one of us if anything happened to you inside the game? Will Akeno, Koneko or Gasper forgive us? No. They would never wish for you to endanger yourself. What you can do in the meantime is stay here and train. Become stronger and wait for them to come out. While their minds may be trapped inside the game, their bodies are still outside. Please stay here and protect them while they are inside.”</p><p><br></p><p>He reassured the boy and finally sent him away.</p><p><br></p><p>Looking at the departing back of the boy, he sighed.</p><p><br></p><p>While he did so, said all those words to the kid, he himself was very nervous inside.</p><p><br></p><p>Right now, he could only hope that everything goes well with this mission.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Game Master -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Eight hundred people have entered the game in total. Five hundred from the Devil’s side and three hundred from other independent factions. This number is only going to increase when others learn of the successful entry of the devil’s side inside the game. I expect the number to be in the thousands when the different human governments and rich businessmen send people inside to rescue their family members.” Red told him as she looked over the list.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, we have prepared for a total of forty million people so it's not a big deal. I seriously doubt they would send that many people inside. Anyways, the more they send the better for us.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I wonder what the world will look like after the game ends. There is sure to be a great upheaval.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s for sure. And they will have to deal with it and overcome it. If they can’t even do so, then their fates at the hands of the Machine and Spirit Gods would be the fault of no one but their own. I can just give them a chance to gain power. If they cannot unite even in the face of world destruction level danger and continue to plot against each other….let them go extinct. I will not stay here protecting them and wiping their asses forever.” He replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, I don’t want to do so either. I am a dragon, not a guard dog.” Red scoffed.</p><p><br></p><p>She had been the one who was most pissed when she found out about her possible future. That had led her to train in earnest and gain the power she had today, which was almost twice of what she had the first time they had met with each other.</p><p><br></p><p>Ophis and Tiamat were the same.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, none of them wanted to be stuck in this world after knowing of the vast multiverse outside. All of them wanted to go out and explore.</p><p><br></p><p>But if they did so, this world would be destroyed for sure. They wouldn’t stand a chance against the Machine Gods and if by some strange miracle they did survive, they would become a slave of the Spirit Gods.</p><p><br></p><p>He had already seen another world facing such an end.</p><p><br></p><p>Being targeted by the Machine Gods and used as the pawn of the Spirit Gods who used them as cheap soldiers to thin out the numbers of their enemies.</p><p><br></p><p>Ultimately, nothing was left of the world.</p><p><br></p><p>While he was sure he could fight even the strongest of the Spirit Gods and Machine Gods with his current power and the help of his lovers, the rest of the world was not strong enough to even survive the clash between the two sides.</p><p><br></p><p>To prevent this from happening, he and all his lovers decided to think of a way to empower the world itself so that they could face the dangers of the outside world.</p><p><br></p><p>He was slightly grateful to this world for making him what he was today but none of this was handed to him on a silver platter. He had to fight from the bottom, as a human on the verge of death due to getting caught between the fight of the two Heavenly Dragons to the strongest existence of this world, he had carved his path with his own two hands. So he was returning the same favour to the world.</p><p><br></p><p>Those who were capable would use this chance to become stronger.</p><p><br></p><p>He had done his part in the background too. He had trapped the messengers of the Spirit Gods who had already arrived to this world a decade ago in a never ending illusion to keep the other side in the dark.</p><p><br></p><p>This game, Soul Art Online, was his wish as well as the last chance of this world to survive their imminent destruction of the whole world.</p><p><br></p><p>“Number of people reaching T3 Class Jobs has reached the mark.” Tiamat interrupted their talks and he looked at the screen.</p><p><br></p><p>Every region has twenty T3 Class people now.</p><p><br></p><p>“Start the first world mission.”</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am back with another chapter of Soul Art Online.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Things are heating up bit by bit.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Arthas became a Goblin Slayer of all things.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The Game is forcing them to face their fears and the months of staying in the game doesn’t make it any better.

His description did match Lelouch and a light probe told me that he wasn’t lying either.</p><p><br></p><p>Anime characters and real characters can be so different sometimes that it was hard to say.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean I remember Harry Potter from the movies and the actual one and they look quite different despite having similar features.</p><p><br></p><p>I would be honest, if I didn’t have the experience of living in an anime world myself, I would have been fanboying but….right now was not the time for it.</p><p><br></p><p>I repeated again, “So, why have you summoned me here? What do you desire?”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy seemed to have broken from his daze as he looked at me in shock. “W-what are you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Me? Oh yes, I guess I haven’t introduced myself yet. My name is Ace. I am what you might know of as a Devil.” I brought my wings out and smiled, looking as his face paled at the revelation. “Don’t worry. I don’t take souls or anything. That’s outdated nowadays. I work for gold, precious metals and stones, rare knowledge, etc. They have to be of equal value though.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I….” Before he could say anything, there was a sound on the door and he quickly went and hid.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well isn’t that a bummer? Anyways, I don’t allow others to summon me without a price so be sure to pay up the next time, one by at most….or else….” I waved my hand and the guy felt a chill in his hiding place. “You will die from my curse.” I saw him pause and his eyes widen. “And, you can summon me anytime you want, for a price of course.”</p><p><br></p><p>With that said, I closed the portal and let out a breath.</p><p><br></p><p>“Really! You threatened him? Is that how you make deals?” Matsu asked but I didn’t sense any malice in her voice. She was actually curious.</p><p><br></p><p>Actually, in all these days, I have never seen anything but adoration from her for myself.</p><p><br></p><p>Because of this very reason, it was hard to even try to push her away from me. She was always trying her best for me.</p><p><br></p><p>Her feelings were so….so innocent….a different type of innocence than Lavy but yet I couldn’t deny that she would give her life for me even without me asking.</p><p><br></p><p>It made me grateful….and scared.</p><p><br></p><p>My new life has made me so distant from the normal things I used to enjoy.</p><p><br></p><p>Sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh! I didn’t mean it like that.” She apologised but I shook my head.</p><p><br></p><p>“I was thinking of something else. Also, I didn’t put any curse on him, just scared him a bit so that he pays in a week. I still don’t have a way to open the portals in any world at will.”</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly I thought of something and looked at her and brought several of my summoning pamphlets and gave them to her.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is this?” She asked, looking at the paper confused.</p><p><br></p><p>“If someday I disappear without any warnings, you can use them. Make sure you use them when you are alone. If it doesn’t work once, do it everyday.”</p><p><br></p><p>She raised her eyebrow so I explained further.</p><p><br></p><p>“If any day I am in a danger I cannot avoid, I would escape to some random world. In that case I would only be summoned by these contracts. Use them for now. I will have a necklace or something similar made for you containing the same contract so that it will be convenient to keep.”</p><p><br></p><p>I hadn’t given this to Lavy yet because she was still young and I didn’t want to burden her right now. Maybe in a year or two.</p><p><br></p><p>“A ring.” She said quickly, her eyes lighting up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I want a ring.” She jumped to my face and held my hand as she stared directly into my eyes. “I want a ring from you. You can make a ring with the contract. A ring which connects me to you….” And she was lost in her dreams.</p><p><br></p><p>“....alright.” I agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yay!” She jumped and hugged me and this time I returned her hug too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tomorrow, there is a party organised for my advancement to Ultimate Class Magician. Lavy, Akeno and Shuri will be there too. Would you like to come with me?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.” She nodded without any second thoughts.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. We will get a dress for you tomorrow morning then.”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded profusely.</p><p><br></p><p>“Also, you should try to see if you can learn some kind of magic. It would give you some manner of self protection in this world. Actually, even if you are in any danger, you can summon me. Just make sure you do it when you are alone or only as a last resort. I don’t want my ability to be exposed anywhere.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.” She nodded in understanding. “Can you teach me?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Can you teach me magic?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I….I only know one or two types of magic which might or might not be compatible with you. If it is then I will, if not then you should check out different kinds of magic books at Grauzauberer’s Library. I will get you admitted as an apprentice if you can learn something. The magic used by the magicians of this world is derived from Devil Magic and requires a lot of mathematical calculations. I think it would be right up your alley.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! Yes, I can do calculations. Alright, I will try and see what I can do.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p><br></p><p>Right at that moment, I sensed another summoning.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Lelouch -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He lay on his knees, thinking if his day could get any worse.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe trying to go after the terrorist truck was not a good idea.</p><p><br></p><p>Everything went wrong from there.</p><p><br></p><p>First he got that damned paper and summoned a….</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>It had to be the devil’s curse.</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t even want to summon that damn guy, dammit….and he would have paid him anyway. Even if he was not a fool, then why curse him?</p><p><br></p><p>It was obviously because of the curse that he was in this situation.</p><p><br></p><p>“Private Kururugi, you are ordered to take them out.” The guy in the lead ordered Suzaku.</p><p><br></p><p>“But sir, they are just civilians. He is just a student.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You bastard, didn’t you swear your loyalty to the Holy Britannian Empire?”</p><p><br></p><p>This is bad.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the green haired girl in front of him.</p><p><br></p><p>They didn’t have any way to run.</p><p><br></p><p>“....I….I cannot kill them, sir.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then die.” The soldier shot Suzaku in the back faster than he could react.</p><p><br></p><p>His eyes widened as he looked at the downed form of Suzaku.</p><p><br></p><p>The soldier raised the gun at him. “A fitting place to end a terrorist, isn’t it? Still you did good for a Britannian student.”</p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://Again….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Again….it</a> was because of Britannia….everything is because of them….always.</p><p><br></p><p>He felt a large range of emotions at this moment. Helplessness, sadness, regret but most of all….rage. He felt rage like he had never before.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly something happened which he was not expecting.</p><p><br></p><p>The paper in his pocket shone like it had done a moment ago and the soldiers stepped back. At the same time he heard a voice he had heard just an hour ago.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, it’s you again. And it looks like you are in a pinch this time.”</p><p><br></p><p>Baam.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the soldier’s shot at the voice but it continued without any interruptions.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, did you decide on what you want?”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the body of Suzaku, still laying on the ground and the soldiers around it.</p><p><br></p><p>One of them had even stepped over it.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes….I know.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Very well then. Tell me what you want. I will fulfil it if I can….for a suitable price of course.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I….want them to die. I want all of them to die.” He shouted.</p><p><br></p><p>The soldiers were startled at his shout and one of them raised his gun to shoot at him but it was frozen before it could even fire. The gun, his hand, everything….just froze. The soldier shouted trying to move his hand as it broke and fell down on the ground, shattering into thousands of pieces.</p><p><br></p><p>“And the price….”</p><p><br></p><p>“You can have anything you want.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Very well. I accept your deal. I will give you their lives….I will even give you revenge against the Britannian Empire and in return I want….you. You….Lelouch, will serve me for the next twenty years. Not even your death will be able to drag you away from me. Do you accept?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>The very next instant, all the soldiers turned into frozen statues.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then….we have a deal. Welcome to the team….Lelouch vi Britannia.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Ace -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the guy still down on his knees as he looked at me in shock.</p><p><br></p><p>Getting Lelouch as a subordinate….</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah, if I can get him to be loyal to me, it would be a massive win. As for how to do so….I had an idea.</p><p><br></p><p>“What? Did you think I didn’t know? I know more about this world than you can even think, kid. But don’t worry. Your name….your lineage….doesn’t matter to me. The only thing I want….is your loyalty.”</p><p><br></p><p>His eyes steeled as he got up.</p><p><br></p><p>I saw him taking a look at the body of Suzaku.</p><p><br></p><p>“He’s still alive.” I said, shaking him from his stupor.</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“That boy….he’s still alive.” I threw him a red potion from Kazuma’s world.</p><p><br></p><p>“Feed him this and he will be alright. I do expect a payment for this though.”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at me and then the potion before going picking it up. “You will be paid.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Great. Five kilograms of gold. Thank you very much.”</p><p><br></p><p>I saw a twitch at the corner of his mouth. “That’s a discounted price, ya know. You don’t have to look so down. I treat my subordinates well. As long as you serve me loyally, I will make sure you and your loved ones stay safe and healthy.”</p><p><br></p><p>I saw him look at me with surprise. “Yes. I will make sure that your sister is healed. I will even tell you who did it and let you have a go at the one responsible for her condition….all for a price.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Name your price.” He said immediately.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nuh uh. Pay for the last deals first.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You will get paid. Name your price for Nunnaly’s cure.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well….I will have to think after I see her injuries.” I made an excuse. I already knew what needed to be done.</p><p><br></p><p>Aqua’s healing could do the work. But if I said it now, I would lose a potential bait for him to summon me again.</p><p><br></p><p>“Now that we are done with you, let’s see if Miss White Dress needs something from me?” I looked at the green haired girl laying on the ground, completely forgotten in the mess. “Hello, Miss. C.C. My name is Ace. I am a Devil….a real one.” I showed her my wings as I saw her eyes widened. “And I can fulfil your wish….for a price obviously.”</p><p><br></p><p>With a flick of my wand, the piece of cloth on her mouth disappeared as she stared at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh come on. Him, I understand but you….you of all people shouldn’t be that surprised. But I am getting late for dinner so I will make this quick. I know what you are. I know what you want. And I can give it to you. In return you will have to do a few things for me. Do you agree?”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at me again before nodding slightly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Say it. Do we have a deal?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.” She whispered</p><p><br></p><p>“Great.” I smiled as I used a flick of my wand to free her. “You were condemned to this fate by a nun, a follower of God and now you are being freed from it by a devil….don’t you think the situation is full of irony?”</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t say anything but kept staring at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Awesome, I am making a killing today.” I turned towards Lelouch again. “You know what? I propose a deal for you. Wanna hear?”</p><p><br></p><p>He raised an eyebrow in thought.</p><p><br></p><p>“Great. So I know that you want revenge against the Britannian Empire but let’s face it….you’re weak.”</p><p><br></p><p>He gritted his teeth at that but didn’t refute my words.</p><p><br></p><p>“So I can give you a power….a power with the potential to overthrow the Britannian Empire….and you know how it goes, for a price obviously.”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked in thought before asking. “Why?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously because I can profit from it. You get your revenge and I get awesome payment. Isn’t this a win-win payment.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You are a devil.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Now you are being plain racist. So what if I am a Devil? How are most of the humans in your family any better?”</p><p><br></p><p>He winced at my quip.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, what will it be?” I asked again.</p><p><br></p><p>“At what price?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm….let’s see….100 Knightframes and 100 tones of Sakuradite.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You are crazy!” He shouted.</p><p><br></p><p>“Heh….yeah, maybe I am. How about 200 Knightframes and 200 tonnes of Sakuradite? After all, I am giving you a power to potentially take over the entire Holy Britannian Empire.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Only with a potential. You could hand me a knife and I could potentially kill everyone above me with it. That’s not a very clear indication.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A smart cookie, alright but no….I will give you a supernatural power, something which will make your path to the throne much easier?”</p><p><br></p><p>“What power?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm….how about a mind control ability? You could temporarily control someone’s mind….or something of that level.” I asked and saw him pause.</p><p><br></p><p>“You….you are lying.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hey there….what reason would I need to lie to you? I mean what even would be the point? If you don’t get something like that you would know and you can back out on the payment. It’s bad for my business, ya know.”</p><p><br></p><p>The guy looked in deep thought for a while. It was at this time that we heard a loud explosion outside and he quickly fell to the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! It looks like people are coming to look for her. You don’t have much time so better hurry up.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, fine! Give me the power.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Great. So one supernatural power in return of two hundred knight frames and two hundred tonnes of Sakuradite.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You said hundred.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And you corrected me on that. Thank you for that.” I smiled. “Do we have a deal?”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked angry but nodded nonetheless. “Deal.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Superb. I am on a roll today. So many deals.” I turned towards C.C. “Can you make a contract with him? Give him a geass. That will be a part of your payment.”</p><p><br></p><p>Both of them were caught off guard at this.</p><p><br></p><p>C.C was the first to regain her bearings and looked at him as she started the process.</p><p><br></p><p>While she was doing this, I bolstered my Occlumency shields while keeping a lookout at him using my Legilimency skills.</p><p><br></p><p>A few seconds later she backed away and at the same moment I verified that he did indeed get the same ability.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t know how strong his ability was but I knew it was connected to his world and would be useless in other worlds….still, I’d rather not risk it.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t give them a chance to react. “Imperio.”</p><p><br></p><p>Learning from the Black Library was helpful although this ability is quite useless in this world.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, even the Cruciatus Curse was useless while the Killing Curse didn’t even work in this world.</p><p><br></p><p>After thinking and experimenting for a while I came to a conclusion that the internal magic in the body of people and supernatural creatures in this world made it nigh impossible to control them. One has to be stronger than them to pull something like this off.</p><p><br></p><p>In a way, Devil magic is far stronger in this aspect than just Imperio.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Cruciatus was the same.</p><p><br></p><p>The Killing Curse on the other <a href=\"https://hand….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">hand….it</a> just didn’t work.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe it had something to do with other worlds. I mean I don’t even know what this curse was and how it functioned.</p><p><br></p><p>Anyways, The DxD world is one where stronger beings can resist time stops used by God Killing weapons….such things were understandable.</p><p><br></p><p>“Use your Geass to order to me clap once.” I ordered.</p><p><br></p><p>He did exactly that. “I Lelouch vi Britannia command you, clap once.”</p><p><br></p><p>As soon as he said this, I felt a force slamming my Occlumency Shields but was pushed away.</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh….do it once more. Order me to clap one time.”</p><p><br></p><p>He repeated but this time I didn’t even feel it.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Matsu. “Can you help me with a small experiment?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes!” She jumped up instantly.</p><p><br></p><p>“One second. Try resisting it.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Lelouch and ordered once more. “Try ordering her to clap once.”</p><p><br></p><p>He did and I saw Matsu narrow her eyes and then shake her head.</p><p><br></p><p>“It was like a buzzing in my head. Annoying but I can shake it off.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Good.” I turned to Lelouch. “Do it once more.”</p><p><br></p><p>He repeated and this time there was no reaction.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nothing?” I asked and she shook her head.</p><p><br></p><p>Alright this confirms it.</p><p><br></p><p>I released my spell on him and he gasped for breath before glaring at me. “What was that?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Just testing if the deal was successful. It is.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It didn’t work.” He said bitingly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh trust me, it did. You are just too weak to command someone like me. Also, so that you don’t go and get yourself killed before repaying me, let me remind you. You can only order someone once. After that they will gain immunity to your power.”</p><p><br></p><p>I left the kid murmuring and turned to the green haired witch and put my hand forward while expanding the size of the portal. “Come on.”</p><p><br></p><p>She took one last look at Lelouch before stepping towards me and I pulled her into the portal before waving a goodbye at the kid and closed the portal.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“So….what do we do now?” Matsu asked, looking at the girl.</p><p><br></p><p>I already had a use for her in mind.</p><p><br></p><p>“You must have noticed the changes in your code by now. You are not in your world anymore.” I spoke directly to her.</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t speak anything as she looked at her hand which had been scraped earlier but was not healing now.</p><p><br></p><p>She was almost in a trance before a teardrop fell from her eyes. “Thank you.” She whispered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry. I was just completing my side of the deal. As you have already noticed, you are a mortal now. But before you fulfil your wish, I want you to live for a while. I won’t ask you to do the impossible. Just a few things. I want you to teach a few people about armed combat, knowledge of firearms, modern knowledge and operating Knightmare frames. You can do whatever you want after at least five batches of students have completed their studies. However if you try to back out from the deal….I will drag your soul out of hell and throw you back to your world.” I narrowed my eyes and said.</p><p><br></p><p>She just nodded silently. “Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Matsu, can you take her to your room and create an identity for her? Explain everything to her and tell everyone that she is your friend. She will be leaving in a week at best.”</p><p><br></p><p>I want to send her to the Empire and teach my team about modern firearms and knowledge and knightmare frames.</p><p><br></p><p>C.C has literal centuries worth of experience. It would be a waste to not use it. Moreover, I need someone to teach people of that world.</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay~” Matsu jumped from her seat and led the girl out to her room while I sat down on my bed.</p><p><br></p><p>Sigh….what a day.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>Settling C.C was easier than I had expected. She didn’t talk much with others except Matsu and me. She mostly lived in the new building we had bought for our company. Even providing food was easy as she was always in a mood to eat pizza. In fact, I wouldn’t doubt if someone told me that she could live her entire life on pizza alone.</p><p><br></p><p>I really thought that the show was exaggerating about her obsession with <a href=\"https://pizza….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">pizza….it</a> didn’t.</p><p><br></p><p>Others didn’t doubt her when Matsu said that she was someone we were planning to hire for our new company.</p><p><br></p><p>Today however was different.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ohh! This looks great on you, Ace-kun.” Shuri said as she fixed the collar of my new robes.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at myself in the mirror and saw the white robes I was wearing. It had a golden chain at the waist with an ornamental sword and staff-like jewellery hanging from them.</p><p><br></p><p>For a magician, their clothes could tell someone of their ranks.</p><p><br></p><p>Low Class Magicians wore simple robes.</p><p><br></p><p>Mid Class Magicians had a belt around their waist area.</p><p><br></p><p>High Class Magicians had golden highlights and ribbons in their robles while Ultimate Class had uniforms similar to mine.</p><p><br></p><p>Mephisto had sent these this morning as a gift.</p><p><br></p><p>Each organisation had uniforms.</p><p><br></p><p>Generally Ultimate Class Magicians didn’t wear them as they were the very top of the pyramid, today was a formal occasion so I was required to dress up as this.</p><p><br></p><p>In front of me, Lavy, Akeno and Matsu were dressed in a similar manner.</p><p><br></p><p>I had asked Mephisto to admit Matsu to the Grauzauberer organisation last night and….he asked me to do it myself. Apparently, I could do that now due to my position.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, I could even promote her to a Middle Class Magician with my authority alone. I didn’t though, as she was not even Low Class level yet.</p><p><br></p><p>What I did however was promote Lavinia who was now a genuine Middle Class Magician.</p><p><br></p><p>She has been over the moon since then.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, I had asked her to be my apprentice along with Akeno and Matsu so that they would get some backing at the organisation due to my name.</p><p><br></p><p>And all of this had led to this situation.</p><p><br></p><p>They had to follow me to the party as my apprentices now.</p><p><br></p><p>All the girls looked pretty happy about this….especially Matsu who thought this was some kind of a roleplay.</p><p><br></p><p>“How do I look….Master~” She asked, with a wide grin as she twirled in front of me to show off her robes.</p><p><br></p><p>My eyes twitched at her question. Yes. She was enjoying this a bit too much.</p><p><br></p><p>And she was not the only one who did so.</p><p><br></p><p>Shuri was covering her mouth and giggling at my situation.</p><p><br></p><p>“Master?” Lavy asked in confusion.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ara ara, you don’t know? You are now Ace-kun’s apprentice. So of course he is your master. If you call him by his name in public, people would make fun of him.” Shuri explained to Lavy.</p><p><br></p><p>And while there was nothing wrong in what she said, she was too enthusiastic about it.</p><p><br></p><p>“Really?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes yes Lavy. We must call him Master in public from now on.” Matsu nodded sagely.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh….okay, Master.” She looked at me and blinked adorably.</p><p><br></p><p>“You can call me teacher or sensei if you want.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No no. That won’t do. Master sounds better.” Matsu cut in and Shuri nodded as well, further explaining whatever bullshit they came up with to the two gullible girls. And isn’t Akeno her own daughter?</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously….even Akeno was getting fooled. Was this the same girl who would have become….that Akeno?</p><p><br></p><p>It was astonishing to see how some changes affect the entire personality of some people.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Whatever.” I raised my hand in surrender. </p><p><br></p><p>The more I argue the more they will tease me.</p><p><br></p><p>At this time there was a knock on the door.</p><p><br></p><p>“I’ll check.” Shuri said as she walked to the door.</p><p><br></p><p>It was one of the maids.</p><p><br></p><p>“Lord Mephisto is waiting for you all.” She bowed and said.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Very well. We will be there soon.” Shuri answered and closed the door after the maid left. She then turned towards us. “Let’s go. It is time.” </p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>Parties like these can only be described in one word - ostentatious.</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, the entire purpose of such parties was to show off. Be it the emergence of a new Ultimate Class Magician among their ranks or attract potential clients to make contracts and business with the organisation. This much was to be expected.</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully, Mephisto was thoughtful enough to keep much of the crowd away from me. But even he couldn’t draw away the big guns.</p><p><br></p><p>Today’s party was special as I was the youngest magician ever to hold the title of an Ultimate Class.</p><p><br></p><p>Fun fact, even among devils, I was only the fourth person to have such a level of power at such a young age. It was something Mephisto told me about.</p><p><br></p><p>And due to this, many people had come to today’s meeting to solicit my services for themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>But even among these people, not everyone was approaching me. This was due to the dragon plush toy floating beside me.</p><p><br></p><p>Tannin.</p><p><br></p><p>The former Dragon King and one of the very few Satan Class beings of the Underworld as well as the Queen of Mephisto.</p><p><br></p><p>He was with me to make sure no one was causing trouble….and believe me, even with such an appearance, no one dared to underestimate the guy.</p><p><br></p><p>Lavy for one was very happy and was playing with the dragon even knowing who he was while Akeno looked curious but far more restrained.</p><p><br></p><p>I saw a group of people led by Mephisto coming towards me.</p><p><br></p><p>“They are from the Golden Dawn.” Tannin informed.</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>The group consisted of four people apart from Mephisto. A dark haired man followed by two blonde kids, one boy and two girls. The boy looked around eleven or twelve years old while the girl looked seven or eight years old.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ace. Meet him. He is Septimus Cage, the current leader of the Golden Dawn, and these two kids are Arthur Pendragon, the heir to the Pendragon Family and his daughter Ley Fay Pendragon.”</p><p><br></p><p>Arthur Pendragon and Ley Fay Pendragon.</p><p><br></p><p>They were the members of team Vali if I remember correctly….although knowing this messed up world, I wouldn’t be surprised if things were completely different in this world.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, this guy was one of the best swordsmen in the series.</p><p><br></p><p>I remember him holding his own against Vasco Strada, although the latter was old and way past his prime, it still showed his talent.</p><p><br></p><p>And the cute little girl beside him was someone who was leading Fenrir of all things around as a pet. She was probably the most prodigious human magician in the entire series.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hello Lord Septimus, Heir Pendragon, Miss Pendragon.” I greeted. I still had the memories of etiquette lessons which wouldn’t make me look out of place even among nobility.</p><p><br></p><p>The other party bowed as well. “Nice to meet you too, Lord Ace.”</p><p><br></p><p>….Lord.</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah….I wasn’t used to it.</p><p><br></p><p>Technically there was nothing wrong in their greeting due to my rank but….damn if it didn’t feel out of place.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha don’t worry about it. Ace is not one for formalities. You should just call him by his name. He isn’t that much older than you.” Mephisto laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Fourteen years and an Ultimate Class Magician. Yeah….that’s young alright.” Septimus said as he took a look at me. “I have heard a lot about your Transfiguration Magic. It is a real treat to see something new being invented and added to our field. For that”, he bowed. “I thank you from the side of all the magicians of the world.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the man shocked.</p><p><br></p><p>He was so sincere.</p><p><br></p><p>“Please! You don’t have to bow. I….wasn’t really thinking much when I did all that.” In fact I only began teaching here because I was repaying my deal with Mephisto.</p><p><br></p><p>“And yet your contribution will help many Magicians rise up in the future. This is a fact that cannot be denied.” He repeated.</p><p><br></p><p>“You should give up and accept his thanks, Ace. This guy is very stubborn like that.” Mephisto shook his head with a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Mephisto and then back at the man and nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>He smiled. “While I would like nothing more than to discuss magic with you for hours, it would be extremely uncouth of me to occupy you all for myself so I will excuse myself today but before I leave, I, Septimus Cage, representing the entire Golden Dawn Magician Organisation would like to invite you as a guest lecturer at our Magician Organisation.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>He smiled. “Mephisto told me that you have been studying Enchantment and Alchemy recently and that even your Transfiguration Magic is inspired by Alchemy. I won’t brag but our Golden Dawn has the best collection of texts in Alchemy and Enchantment among all other Magician Organisations. As a Guest Lecturer, you will be able to peruse all these at your own leisure. I am sure it will also help your studies. A mutually beneficial agreement. In fact, this offer is also applicable to your apprentices. Of course if you were to join us….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oi oi, I only talked about a guest lecture at your place and now you are trying to steal my Ace.” Mephisto interrupted.</p><p><br></p><p>The man smiled unabashed. “Can you blame me for trying?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmph.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the two and saw that Mephisto actually agreed to it.</p><p><br></p><p>“You should agree. While I don’t want to, I will have to agree that their collection of books are among the best in the entire Magician Community. You would benefit greatly from it.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded and bowed lightly. “I would be honoured to.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha no need to bow. While you are young, both of us are at the same rank.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man shook my hand, followed by Arthur Pendragon.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have heard alot about you. I hope we can spar sometimes.” He said quite seriously.</p><p><br></p><p>“I would love to. It might not look like it but I did wield a sword for some time. I would love to get some advice from you.” I smiled. I wasn’t even lying either.</p><p><br></p><p>I was only taught bits of swordsmanship by Dave but I made sure to practise it everyday. I also had Gram and the swords from other worlds. It would be a waste if I didn’t learn swordsmanship to take full advantage of the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>As expected, his eyes lit up at my words but he kept his excitement hidden under the mask of composure. “I look forward to it.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally the little girl shook hands with me. “Umm….your magic….it’s amazing.” She said cutely. I suddenly had the urge to pat her head.</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled and brought out my wand and brought out my handkerchief and with a slight flick, I transformed it into a rabbit.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl looked in amazement.</p><p><br></p><p>I handed it to her. “Thank you for the compliment, Miss. Here, something from me.”</p><p><br></p><p>She blushed but bowed deeply before taking the rabbit with a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha it’s nice to see young people getting along.” Septimus laughed as he patted my shoulder enthusiastically. before looking at the three girls behind me. “Are they your students?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Two of them have just started learning magic while Lavinia has been studying here for a while and I just took her as an apprentice today.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well great to see such budding talents. I hope to see you all rise.”</p><p><br></p><p>After he left I turned towards Mephisto who had stayed back. Tannin took this opportunity to roam around the party</p><p><br></p><p>“You did say that you wanted to learn more about those two fields of magic.” He shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>I let out a sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>I guess this is how a devil acted. Giving someone something but with a catch. And this guy was a devil even before The Devil himself was one.</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t have to worry. Septimus….he is a genuinely good person. That guy wants nothing more than to see the world progress in the field of magic and holds no discrimination against other races. I won’t say there are no bad apples in the Golden Dawn….believe me, there are plenty of those, but which organisation doesn’t have those kinds of people? You will have to handle that yourself.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thanks.” I said after a thought. He….did help me after all.</p><p><br></p><p>While we were discussing this, several new guests had arrived.</p><p><br></p><p>A few familiar faces among the group.</p><p><br></p><p>Rudiger Rozenkreutz and McGregor Mathews had arrived followed by a few faces I wasn’t expecting.</p><p><br></p><p>As I saw the last two people in the group my head snapped towards Mephisto. “What is the meaning of this?” I hissed, my tone scaring the girls behind me by the sheer hatred in my voice.</p><p><br></p><p>“They have contracts with several High Class Magicians and they can bring an extra. There was nothing I could do without making it obvious.” Mephisto replied calmly, showing no extra emotion on his face.</p><p><br></p><p>“You could have told me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Would you have come if I did?”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>I took a deep breath and calmed myself down.</p><p><br></p><p>I really didn’t think it would have this much effect on me.</p><p><br></p><p>After all, everything I knew about them till now was from the memories.</p><p><br></p><p>My own memories of my previous life were the dominant force when compared to the memories of this life. Still….</p><p><br></p><p>This was the first time I had seen them personally….and the hate I felt….was far more than I was expecting.</p><p><br></p><p>I had often wondered if I had taken over the body of the dead Acelin or if I had just regained my memories of the previous life at that moment and I had always preferred the first version….maybe to separate myself from this….burden….and yet now….when I see that blonde bastard walking towards me….I was doubting my theories.</p><p><br></p><p>I guess a second chance at life doesn’t come so easily.</p><p><br></p><p>I took a deep breath and used my Occlumency to push away any stray thoughts and calm my mind down.</p><p><br></p><p>My life was getting better after a long time. I didn’t need this fucking drama making a mess of things.</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t have to worry. I doubt they would even recognise your spell. Honestly I can’t even tell that you are under a spell right now.” Mephisto said.</p><p><br></p><p>Obviously.</p><p><br></p><p>I had changed the way I was disguising myself.</p><p><br></p><p>Instead of using Gaea Foundation, I was using human transfiguration to change my looks. This type of disguise actually changes my looks so it cannot be felt by others.</p><p><br></p><p>I had been working on this since the first time I found out that Mephisto had figured out that I was under a disguise. </p><p><br></p><p>“Ace?” I heard Matsu’s voice behind me and looked back.</p><p><br></p><p>Apart from Mephisto and Lavy, she was the only one who knew about me.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s fine. This is nothing. Just act normal.”</p><p><br></p><p>We didn’t get much time to talk as the group had arrived in front of us.</p><p><br></p><p>Mephisto stepped in front of me. “Welcome. I didn’t think all of us would be able to come here today.”</p><p><br></p><p>The grey haired guy at the lead spoke first. “It was hard not to, especially after hearing about something like this.” He looked at me. “I assume this is him?”</p><p><br></p><p>Mephisto smiled. “Yes. This is Ace. But I guess you have already heard about him and Ace, this is Diehauser Belial, the Champion of the Rating Games, the Emperor.” Mephisto introduced.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the man in front of me who was looking at me with an appraising look and bowed slightly. “Nice to meet you, Sir.”</p><p><br></p><p>Diehauser Belial was a man….I could actually respect.</p><p><br></p><p>He worked his way up from the heir of an almost bankrupt noble house to become the champion of the Rating Games, without any kind of cheating even when almost all others were cheating, through nothing but hard work….this was something which deserved respect.</p><p><br></p><p>“The youngest Ultimate Class Magician in all of history. I honestly didn’t even know they could be this young.” The pink haired woman….my so-called aunt, said.</p><p><br></p><p>This was actually the first time I had seen her directly, be it in real life or in my memories.</p><p><br></p><p>All I had about her are memories of her sister speaking about her.</p><p><br></p><p>My emotions about her were not that intense apart from slight anger.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t let his age fool you. Ace and his Transfiguration Magic would be a thing of terror in the Rating Games. I am both anticipating and dreading the day he joins the Rating Games himself.” Rudiger said with a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>I pushed my stray thoughts aside and gave the man a slight bow. “You are praising me too much, Sir.”</p><p><br></p><p>He then looked behind me. “Are they with you?” He asked, looking at the girls.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. They are my apprentices.” I answered, trying to concentrate more on the conversation than the people around me.</p><p><br></p><p>He smiled. “I guess they must be quite good for you to take a liking to them.”</p><p><br></p><p>“They are all quite talented and dedicated to learning.” I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“All that is good and all but why is there a filthy crow among them.” The voice of the blonde bastard ruined the entire moment.</p><p><br></p><p>Frowns appeared on the faces of several people and even Mephisto while Akeno shrunk back behind me.</p><p><br></p><p>He was however unbothered by this and continued. “Having different tastes is fine but you shouldn’t associate yourself with such things. They would only drag you down.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Bedeze, shut up!” Roygun said with a venomous tone.</p><p><br></p><p>He snorted as he looked at her provokingly. “Oh! How am I wrong? Tell me why else would he keep something like that around? Do you really think she has other uses?”</p><p><br></p><p>And just like that my efforts to reign my temper went down to hell.</p><p><br></p><p>With this much insult towards my student, I would have been enraged even if I had met him for the first time.</p><p><br></p><p>This guy, Bedeze Abaddon….was the worst kind of filth there is.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked back at Akeno who was clenching her hand and looking down towards the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>This was an eleven year old child dammit.</p><p><br></p><p>I patted her head and she looked up at me. Her eyes were slightly wet but she was holding back from crying. I caressed her head lightly before turning back at the bastard.</p><p><br></p><p>“I took her in as my student because….she is far more talented than a talentless nobody like you can ever dream of being.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>There was a period of silence in the place before the guy burst out in a storm of demonic power.</p><p><br></p><p>I answered with my own, albeit far lower reserves but enough to withstand his pressure without backing away.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“What did you say?”</em> He asked slowly, his eyes narrowing.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! I guess you are deaf too apart from being a talentless piece of shit. Very well, I will repeat it again. I said you are a talentless nobody.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You brat!” He shouted before a hand descended on his shoulder.</p><p><br></p><p>Diehauser Belial stepped forward. “You were out of line, Bedeze.” He spoke in a calm tone.</p><p><br></p><p>Mephisto stepped forward next. “Indeed. This place is <strong>my</strong> territory. Who I take in as a part of my organisation is <strong>my</strong> decision alone. Akeno Himejima is the daughter of my new pawn, Shuri Himejima, a part of my household. You insulted a member of my household and by extension, my decision and choice. Leave.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What?!” He looked shocked at Mephisto.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are no longer invited here. You may leave.” Mephisto said with a serious look.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t need deep Legilimency probing to see that the old devil was actually angry this time.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, this was the first time I had seen him being angry.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are removing me for….this….for this….cro….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Leave!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Very well. I will remember this.” He snarled.</p><p><br></p><p>“I sincerely wish that you do because next time I will have you thrown out.” Mephisto spoke as Tannin had appeared behind him.</p><p><br></p><p>The man glared at everyone, especially me one last time and left the hall in anger.</p><p><br></p><p>The entire fiasco had attracted many eyes so Mephisto came forward and clapped his hands and spoke. “It was just a minor hiccup. Please enjoy the party.”</p><p><br></p><p>Diehauser on the other hand looked at me. “Don’t mind him. He….doesn’t have the best personality.”</p><p><br></p><p>Oh, you don’t have to tell me that.</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded. “I didn’t mind. As I said, he is a nobody. I don’t mind.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Despite his unpleasant attitude, he is not a nobody. As the third Ranked Rating Game player and an Ultimate Class devil, he wields a lot of influence in the Underworld. And now that he has been pushed like this he will….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do nothing….because he can do nothing. He will try….but he won’t succeed.” Tannin interrupted with a tone of finality.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well if you say so. He is still a petty bastard so you would do well to keep your guard up.” Roygun said and her disgust for the man was clear to hear.</p><p><br></p><p>“The most he would do is pull back his contracts. He and his associates only account for less than one percent of the total contracts of Grauzauberer. Ace on the other hand, despite his recent arrival has pulled several times more contracts than him and this number will only increase more. That fool should have known when to put aside his arrogance. If he goes anywhere beyond words….” He left the words hanging.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, if you are fine with it then I guess it should be fine. Anyways, let me get to the matter we have all come here for.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You are cutting in line again.” Roygun said while the man rolled his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“There is no line.” He then turned towards me. “Ace, would you like to join my peerage?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the group, already aware that I was going to be asked this question by many and bowed slightly.</p><p><br></p><p>“I thank you for the opportunity but I don’t wish to join any peerages.” I replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“I told you.” Rudiger shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>“I guess I tried. Very well then. I wish you luck for your future endeavours.” He shook hands with me and left.</p><p><br></p><p>Others did the same. </p><p><br></p><p>I suddenly remembered something and looked at Rudiger Rosenkreutz.</p><p><br></p><p>“Lord Rozenkreutz. If you don’t mind, could I have a word with you in private? It won’t take much of your time.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man looked surprised at my request and I took this opportunity to excuse myself from the group but not before telling the three girls to stay with Tannin.</p><p><br></p><p>On a nearby balcony, I quickly threw a small charm to hide our words as I wondered for a moment how I should articulate this properly.</p><p><br></p><p>“First of all, I would like to apologise if I say something out of line. I really don’t mean to be insulting in this case.”</p><p><br></p><p>He raised an eyebrow and just laughed. “Don’t worry. I am not the kind to take offence so easily.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded. “I….heard about your son’s condition after my exam.”</p><p><br></p><p>His face changed slightly at this.</p><p><br></p><p>“I….would you like to hear a story first?”</p><p><br></p><p>His expression didn’t change but he nodded briefly.</p><p><br></p><p>“A kid was born with a Sacred Gear, a very <em>very</em> strong Sacred Gear….” I noticed his expression change as he understood my insinuation. “In a Balance Breaker. Obviously such a thing would have led to the death of any normal child, let alone a human, but he is still alive….without any kind of side effects.”</p><p><br></p><p>His expressions changed. “How?!”</p><p><br></p><p>“His grandmother is a magician who practised Buddhist methods. She was able to seal the Sacred Gear inside his body through some kind of spell.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Who are they? Where can I find them?” He asked desperately. I was actually taken aback at the man’s pleading tone.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, he must have been at his wit’s ends.</p><p><br></p><p>“Please let me clarify a few things first. First, I am not one hundred percent sure about this news. I am not in a place to verify this.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s fine as long as there is even a one percent chance.” He quickly replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright but you need to promise me something first.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What do you need? You don’t need to worry about the price.” The man said almost immediately.</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t need anything that big. Just a few promises. First, you will tell no one about this and leave the family alone apart from any help they might ask. This includes not trying to bring the kid to your or anyone’s peerages. As far as I know, they desire a simple life and I don’t want their family to be implicated because of my interference.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Agreed. You don’t need to worry. If they can really help my son, I will protect them at any costs.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded. “Second, you will not reveal my name anywhere and by that I mean not even to Mephisto.”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Third, I would like three favours, nothing big really and nothing illegal. Just small helps. You can do this after the process is successful.”</p><p><br></p><p>“If the information turns out to be true, you will always have my friendship. It doesn’t matter if the process is successful.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay.” I then went on to tell them about Tobio Ikuse and his situation. “Apart from this, you can ask Azazel for help. He knows a lot about Sacred Gears and can help you. I think you can manage that easily.” I remembered that this guy had managed to convince the Satans to invite Dulio Gesualdo of all people to the Underworld. Contacting someone like Azazel who would probably jump at such a chance would be easier.</p><p><br></p><p>“If it helps, my student Akeno is the daughter of the Fallen Angel Cadre, Baraqiel and I can ask her mother for help. Oh and Akeno is also the cousin of Tobio Ikuse and the grandniece of Ageha Ikuse.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I thank you.” He bowed deeply.</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t need to thank me. If anything, I am actually pleased to help someone like you who is doing so much for your son.”</p><p><br></p><p>We talked about a few more things and he said that he was going to talk to Mephisto and Shuri before going to meet Ageha Ikuse and if that didn’t work, he would contact other people with expertise in Buddhist methods who can help him.</p><p><br></p><p>By the end of the conversation, I saw a hint of light return to the man’s eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>When it was time for us to leave, he spoke again. “By the way you should be careful too. Bedeze is a very petty man. I don’t doubt that he will come for you. Although I doubt he would be able to do anything with Mephisto being there like those other Magician organisations, it still doesn’t stop him from sullying your name with rumours. You shouldn’t give into his provocations.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Trust me, I know exactly how low he can fall.” In fact, I doubt there would be anyone else in the world who knew better than me. And then something struck my mind. “What did you say about those other magician organisations?”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at me oddly. “The Magician Organisations who have been sending people to kidnap and kill you since you appeared. Mephisto has stopped over two dozen such attacks and then Tannin finally destroyed several branches of those organisations to send a warning before they stopped.” he must have noticed the stunned look on my face. “You….didn’t know?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I….”</p><p><br></p><p>What the fuck has been happening in the world?</p><p><br></p><p>He left after explaining the matter to me and I won’t lie but it increased my respect for Mephisto a bit.</p><p><br></p><p>The rest of the party was without any incidents and we returned back home.</p><p><br></p><p>Shuri came and thanked me personally for standing up for Akeno while the girl gave me a hug.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ace, are you alright?” Matsu asked. She has been worried since that incident.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Don’t worry. He won’t be able to do anything.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am not worried about what he will do. I am more worried about you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I….am fine. I just wasn’t expecting that and lost control of my emotions for a while. Fucking hormones.”</p><p><br></p><p>I thought of something and decided that I had been putting it off for a while now and decided to do it today.</p><p><br></p><p>And sure enough, after my class with Dumbledore, I got ready to leave.</p><p><br></p><p>“Matsu, you and Lavy sleep early today. I have something to do today.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm? Will you be returning late?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will be back by tomorrow morning.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. Take care.” She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>I brought out my Teigu, the Dimensional Formation Shambala and teleported to the previously marked location, the Underworld.</p><p><br></p><p>It had been a while since I met Dave. I missed him.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am back with another chapter of Ace in the Hole.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>A few things happened in this chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ace fooled Lelouch and got a deal….well several deals out of him.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Their relationship is going to be interesting in the future.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>We also got C.C. so the entire thing was already a win for Ace.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Things happened at the party.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Even when actively being ignored, Bedeze managed to piss Ace off.

My memories about this world weren’t clear apart from a few things. I hadn’t seen the whole thing or read the complete Manga so collecting information would be good.</p><p><br></p><p>A few minutes later, I understood the reason. The ones who were chasing her were the members of the Disciplinary Squad of MBI because she had stolen something called a Jinki.</p><p><br></p><p>As for Jinki, these were some kind of super important artifacts of the Sekirei from the so called ‘Age of Gods’.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly there was a knock on the door.</p><p><br></p><p>Lavy.</p><p><br></p><p>“Behave normally. Don’t tell anyone about my powers or anything which happened here. This is a different world than the one you are from. For everyone else here, you are a friend of mine whom I met online.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ooh! A secret mission. Who is it at the door? Your girlfriend, lover or don’t tell me… your wife?! This is so exciting, like a secret lover hiding from the wife. By the way, I don’t mind if you have other lovers… it just makes me feel…”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Please….just quiet. I will explain everything later.” I calmed her down before opening the door.</p><p><br></p><p>Sure enough, it was Lavy.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ace, it’s time for dinner.” She said and then paused looking at the other person in the room. “Who is she?”</p><p><br></p><p>“This is Matsu. She is a friend and someone I am intending to collaborate with on some of my projects.” I turned towards Lavinia and introduced her to Matsu as well.</p><p><br></p><p>“Your friend? Really?” She asked, suspiciously.</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh? What do you mean by that?” I asked, offended.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nothing….it’s just that you never go out of your room for anything except classes or food, a….what was the word for it, yes….’Hikikomori’, so it’s strange that you have friends.” She tilted her head cutely but I felt as if I was getting shot by arrows with every word from her.</p><p><br></p><p>Behind me I heard Matsu giggle at her words.</p><p><br></p><p>“....I am not a Hikikomori. I was a hunter alright. And I don’t just lock myself in my room. I work. It’s not the same.” I complained.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh….really?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.” I facepalmed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay then. Would your friend be joining us for dinner?”</p><p><br></p><p>Going out for dinner would mean facing Shuri and she would catch Matsu instantly due to her inexperience.</p><p><br></p><p>I was about to deny when Matsu’s stomach made a noise and she looked embarrassed and I let out a sigh. “Alright. She’ll join.”</p><p><br></p><p>We went to the dining room where Shuri and Akeno were already waiting.</p><p><br></p><p>They were surprised by the new arrival but took it in a stride when I introduced her as a friend.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my. Ace-kun brought a friend home. I never thought I would see the day.” Shuri laughed, covering her mouth with a hand.</p><p><br></p><p>I just let out a sigh, knowing that they would just increase their teasing if I responded.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, what do you do Matsu-san and how did you two meet?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I work as a freelance programmer.” She lied through her teeth. “I found one of Ace’s papers and he appeared in front of me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Papers?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Contracts.” I offered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh. Well, good to see that you are making more friends. You are welcome to visit us anytime, Matsu-san.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Actually, she just lost her home and my deal with her is to give her a place to live and in return she will do some work for me.” I interrupted, slowly creating a story in my mind.</p><p><br>It’s not that she will ask me any more but some others might get suspicious of Matsu and they won’t find any information about her which will raise too many questions.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my. That’s horrible. Are you well now?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Y-es. I was saved by Ace at the right time.” She replied.</p><p><br></p><p>They however didn’t question her more.</p><p><br></p><p>We had dinner and left for my room.</p><p><br></p><p>I directly took her inside the trunk lab and explained the situation to her.</p><p><br></p><p>Several hours later, she sat in front of me, taking things surprisingly well.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you not surprised?” I couldn’t help but ask.</p><p><br></p><p>She shrugged at my question. “I was originally from another planet and the survivors of our race went to earth. So if other planets with life can exist, why can’t other dimensions with life exist?”</p><p><br></p><p>“….fair point.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But that does bring me to a question. How did you wing me?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Excuse me?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ordinarily only someone with the DNA of a sekirei can awaken the ability to be an Ashikabi. You on the other hand….are from a different world all together.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.” Her words made me think. “Can I see you using your power?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm, my power is Technopathy. I can control digital devices.” She said and I remembered but my trunk had several things which could be used.</p><p><br></p><p>I kept several laptops and computers for trade in my trunk so I just pointed her towards one. She opened one and stepped back and closed her eyes and sure enough, things began to start running on them one by one.</p><p><br></p><p>While she was doing this, I was trying to sense how she was doing this. It had a slight hint of magic.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you get anything?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s magic.” I replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is my ability.” She explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“No no, what I meant to say was that you are using Magic.”</p><p><br>“Well, some people did call it that. I believe that in the old days, the ones from the previous seven ships were called Gods by several people of Earth.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That does make sense. And since they did have children with humans, they passed on the ability through their blood but over generations, their blood thinned and their descendants lost their ability to use these….powers but their blood must still contain this DNA and maybe small traces of magic. Kinda like squibs.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Squibs?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Non Magical humans….not an important topic for now. Anyways, I think it should either be a matching element or the quantity of latent magic from the Ashikabi which make the Sekirei attracted to them. After all, from what you have told me, you all were sent to Earth to continue your entire race so choosing the best possible mate would be something one would consider. Well, it is just my theory but I think Sekirei were made in a way that they react to ones with strong and latent magic. There are those who can trigger more than one Sekirei, right?”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked to be in thought. <a href=\"https://“Yes….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">“Yes….it</a> is possible.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then it is probably the quantity of latent magic rather than elemental compatibility or the Ashikabi would have to have ancestors with different elements.” I said, while trying to piece more of the theory. “Well, it is still all just a theory. But if it is true, then me winging you is not a surprise. Many people from this world could do the same.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I….see. Still, it doesn’t change the fact that you are my Ashikabi and I am your Sekirei.” She said with a tone of finality which was quite different from her chipper and playful attitude till now.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sigh….this is all too sudden.” I mean she jumped me dammit. “but….since it has come to it….welcome to the family.” From what little I remembered of the world, Ashikabi meant everything to a Sekirei.</p><p><br></p><p>Abandoning her would be worse than killing her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Really! Thank you.” She jumped on me and I dodged to the side.</p><p><br></p><p>“We must establish a few rules first.” I sat her down and explained the basic rules of the place and how she will have to act to not attract attention or I’m screwed.</p><p><br></p><p>The only thing that came out of this is that if things were as I remembered, then a Sekirei would be completely loyal to their Ashikabi. WIth this, I can have someone helping me out in some of my work.</p><p><br></p><p>It also brought me to another thought.</p><p><br></p><p>What if someone attacked me directly after opening the Hole? I would be screwed without even understanding anything.</p><p><br></p><p>I needed to take measures for such a case.</p><p><br></p><p>I put on the necklace I had received from Wiz inside my clothes.</p><p><br></p><p>I will have to erect a barrier next time before opening the portal to prevent any such thing from happening ever again.</p><p><br></p><p>With our conversation over, I brought her back to my room and had the room beside mine cleaned and on her request, transfigured a door between our rooms.</p><p><br></p><p>In her room, she set up several of the computers for her work.</p><p><br></p><p>I got her a connection to the Devil Net and internet and the first thing she did was make an identity for herself and a background.</p><p><br></p><p>At least now she is a registered resident of Japan. It was done mainly because in her last world, she was a resident of Japan and knew the language as well as the customs of the place which would make her story more believable.</p><p><br></p><p>Lavy was already sleeping on my bed and this made Matsu throw a knowing look at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“I’m fourteen.” I replied, rolling my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Old enough. In olden times….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Shh shh shh….I want to sleep.” I waved her off.</p><p><br></p><p>This girl was a pervert.</p><p><br></p><p>But I was extremely tired from all the work. It was less of a physical exhaustion and more or a mental exhaustion.</p><p><br></p><p>I lay down on my bed and before I knew it, I was already deep in sleep.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I woke up the next morning with two people hugging me from both sides.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked to the side and saw Lavy and Matsu hugging me from either side and slowly removed their arms from me.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the clock and realised that it was almost time for my class so I hurried to get ready and leave.</p><p><br></p><p>Before leaving, I woke Matsu up and told her to stay inside the room and learn more about the world.</p><p><br></p><p>After teaching my class, I went to Mephisto to have a talk.</p><p><br></p><p>“Come in. Oh! It’s you Ace. Take a seat.” He invited me, looking up from his stack of papers.</p><p><br></p><p>I took the seat and waited for him to complete his work.</p><p><br></p><p>After fifteen minutes, he kept his pen aside and looked at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, what can I do for you?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will have someone staying with me for a while.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh!” He smiled. “Is it a girl? Oh my, Lavinia will be disappointed….but then again, it is normal for Devils to have harems.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“She is someone who summoned me using one of my contracts. I think she is skilled and can help me with some of my work so I took her in. I was just here to inform you that she will be staying with me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well alright. It is your house for all matters and purposes. I don’t mind anyone there as long as they don’t become a danger to us.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you. She is completely safe. I can guarantee it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Since you say so. By the way, I have already contacted the examiners for your Ultimate Class Magician Promotion Exams. I want you to be prepared tomorrow. Those guys can be very picky so be prepared. You can take a leave today. I will inform your class.” He warned.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s fine. I can teach. I already have something in mind for the exams.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Great. Off to work then. I have to fill up several forms. Your classes have brought too many new magicians wanting to join our organisation. This has increased my workload.” He complained but I sensed that he was happy.</p><p><br></p><p>I taught another class and went back to find Matsu in her room, in front of her computer.</p><p><br></p><p>“Can I order a few things from the Internet?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm sure.” I passed her a card. I didn’t have any shortage of money right now due to all my students taking extra classes and making contracts. “I have an exam tomorrow so I will be a bit busy. If you need anything, you can ask the maids in the house. They have been informed about you. By the way, did anyone come to visit you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Got it. I am still familiarising myself with everything here. And yes. Shuri-san came by to bring me breakfast but left when she saw that I was working.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay.”</p><p><br></p><p>I went back to my own room and started working on the final part of the spell I was going to use tomorrow.</p><p><br></p><p>I needed to be able to affect a city with the spell.</p><p><br></p><p>Transfiguration was not a Magic suited for mass destruction… or at least that was what people in the wizarding world thought but with enough power behind it, even a stone can be used as a cannonball.</p><p><br></p><p>I was going to use my Ultimate Class Demonic Power reserves to my advantage.</p><p><br></p><p>By the time I was done with everything, it was time for Dumbledore’s class. I used the class to clear some of my doubts with him, ironing out the final pieces of the spells.</p><p><br></p><p>After the class, I felt a summoning and quickly erected a barrier in front of me and then opened the portal.</p><p><br></p><p>On the opposite side was a familiar face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Kazuma. How have you been?” I asked him with a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>He quickly offered me the rings. I checked them and they contained the name of the spells on them too. “Great job.” I offered him the rest of the payment. “It is always great to do trade with you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Same here.” He gave me a thumbs up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Glad to hear that. In that case, summon me when you have any deals or when Miss Wiz gets any new items.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will.” He replied but his eyes didn’t move from the games in his hands.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, this guy forgets all his fears as soon as his games are in his hands.</p><p><br></p><p>I closed the portal behind him and took an early day off today.</p><p><br></p><p>I need to be in top shape tomorrow.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Mephisto -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He sat with the rest of the examiners for Ace’s Ultimate Class Magician assessment. He still prefered Ace to Acelin because it was a mouthful.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy was barely fourteen and a half and was already taking the assessment to become an Ultimate Class Magician.</p><p><br></p><p>In front of them were several screens monitoring Ace as well as the different parts of the city.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is he the new star of your Grauzaberer Magician organisation that I have been hearing so much about?” He took the file in front of him and read. “Ace. The guy who created the ‘Transfiguration Magic’?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Have you not been keeping up with the news?” Mephisto asked the guy.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am sorry but I have been… busy with some familial issues.” the man spoke with a sombre tone. </p><p><br></p><p>Ah, he had heard of it. His son was born with a Sacred Gear which was out of control.</p><p><br></p><p>The man didn’t elaborate further so he didn’t ask either. “He’s far younger than I had imagined. Did he really create a completely new type of magic?”</p><p><br></p><p>“That he did and even teaches classes in Grauzaberer.” The other examiner for the test, MacGregor Mathers, the bishop of Saelena Lucifer asked. “I have had the pleasure of seeing one of his creations and it was quite a new approach to magic. Not to mention the book he wrote. Transfiguration is an incredibly versatile type of magic.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But whether he is really worthy of being an Ultimate Class Magician remains to be seen.” The last one on the panel, Markus Ambrosius said.</p><p><br></p><p>He shot a look at the magician in service of the Pendragon family. They used Merlin’s title just like the Pendragons used Arthur Pendragon’s title, but unlike the latter he didn’t have any blood relation to Merlin himself, and that alone was his claim to fame.</p><p><br></p><p>Did this idiot really think creating a new branch of Magic was a small feat? Or was he thinking himself to be his namesake?</p><p><br></p><p>If he wasn’t so special then why were the Golden Dawn begging for joint classes?</p><p><br></p><p>Mephisto didn’t comment and looked at the screen. He didn’t need to after all, he had already seen the true extent of Ace’s power a month ago.</p><p><br></p><p>The three examiners had finished looking at the records of his achievements and everything was already verified, making him eligible for the test so Mathers, as the senior most examiner, started the exam.</p><p><br></p><p>On the screen, Ace was wearing the standard Grauzaberer Uniform, a grey robe with a wizard’s hat, after their namesake, the Grey Wizards.</p><p><br></p><p>This was probably the first time he had seen him in this uniform.</p><p><br></p><p>He drew his black wand and pointed towards the ground and a bolt of magic shot at the ground. The spell hit the ground and disappeared in it.</p><p><br></p><p>They waited for a few seconds for something to happen.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is that it? So much for a new branch of Magic.” Markus commented but just as his comment had ended, the ground began to shake. The tremors grew bigger and the entire ground began to rise as if a mountain was coming out of the earth.</p><p><br></p><p>They watched as a small mountain formed in front of them but that was not all. One by one several mountains rose from the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well… that’s certainly above a High Class level. It completely changed the terrain of the place. Although the way to utilise the spell could use some work. Creating mountains alone is just…” Rudiger’s words were stopped by a sudden roar from one of the mountains which was then followed by the other seven as well.</p><p><br></p><p>The mountains shook and out of the mounds of dust came out gigantic dragons. These dragons made Tannin look like an ant. They spread their wings and flapped, blowing away the nearby buildings as they took to the skies.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s…”</p><p><br></p><p>Those beasts could destroy cities.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure he is not using the Annihilation Maker?” Rudiger asked, looking at him seriously.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. he is a natural born devil.” He replied, smugly throwing a look at the wannabe Merlin who had his mouth open in shock.</p><p><br></p><p>But apparently Ace wasn’t done yet.</p><p><br></p><p>Those beasts gathered their breaths and shot beams of fire at the city below.</p><p><br></p><p>Wherever those beams struck, it vapourised everything in their path with a blast radius of around a kilometre.</p><p><br></p><p>All of them watched as within a few minutes, the entire city was razed to the ground and the eight dragons took to the skies till they could not be seen.</p><p><br></p><p>No one understood what they were doing until a dozen or so seconds later, they saw meteors the size of a small mountain finally collapsing on the city below, taking care of anything that was left.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked towards the panel. “Is this a pass?”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>And then clicked a photo.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Ace -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I stood before the magicians who had come to assess my performance.</p><p><br></p><p>The scale of the spell had taken a lot out of me and I had to take a break for an hour to recover from exhaustion before I could appear here.</p><p><br></p><p>Even with Ultimate Class powers, spells of this scale are difficult to cast.</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully, I was using a bit of the Luck Potion and Rowena Ravenclaw’s Diadem under my hat, lending me a helping hand in casting the spell.</p><p><br></p><p>Mephisto introduced them to me one by one.</p><p><br></p><p>All big names including the strongest Bishop of the Underworld.</p><p><br></p><p>“Can you explain the spell?” The green haired man, Rudiger Rosenkreutz asked.</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded. “I used a Compound Transfiguration Magic. First I transfigured the earth into mountains and then those mountains into dragons. Inside their stomach, the earth was transfigured into fuel and dirt mixture and compressed at high pressure, basically creating a thermobaric weapon in its stomach which they used in their breaths. And finally they took to the skies and I cancelled the spell, dropping those mountains on the ground.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man looked in thought before nodding his head. “Makes sense. Each of those dragons alone could have rivalled a strong High Class Devil and you made eight of those. This alone was enough to pass the exam but then you went and added the meteors.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I… was told that I had to destroy the city to pass.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Affect the city. Not everyone can destroy a city in a single attack. To affect it, a single meteor would have been enough but I am glad that we got to see such a spectacular show. Great job young man. I hope to see more of your work in the future.” Macgregor Mathers praised.</p><p><br></p><p>The last man didn’t say anything but he just looked at me with a sour face.</p><p><br></p><p>What’s his problem? But I didn’t ask as long as it didn’t affect me.</p><p><br></p><p>Macgregor brought out a badge and a certificate offered to me. “This is an Ultimate Class Magician Certification. Welcome to the big leagues, Ace. Next, I look forward to your performance in the Recommendation Games.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you, Sir.” I replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“Recommendation Games? Are you talking about the new Law passed by the Satans?” Rudiger asked and then as if understanding something, he turned to look at me. “Are you a Low Class Devil?” He asked, stunned.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Sir.” I replied, politely.</p><p><br></p><p>He stared blankly at me for a moment and then added. “Say Ace, would you like to join my Peerage as a Bishop? We can draw a contract if you want.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Oi, just what do you think you are doing. Stealing my people right in front of my eyes.” Mephisto came in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ahahahaha I am sorry, Lord Pheles but I am really impressed by his talent and want to nurture him. I think he could advance very quickly by participating in the Rating Games in my peerage. The sheer potential of Transfiguration Magic in different types of Rating Games is hard to describe.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hehehehe you are late already Rudiger. This kid has been offered an internship by Lord Beelzebub himself. I doubt he will be joining anyone’s peerage.” Mathers laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>As expected he knew about the whole thing.</p><p><br></p><p>Was he sent by the Satans to check up on me?</p><p><br></p><p>“Really! Ajuka Beelzebub himself? Well in that case, I don’t think I can offer anything to him then but my offer is still open. And even without that, I would love to have you over for tea sometimes. I have a young son. He would love to make new friends.” He laughed but I saw a sense of sadness in his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Have you found any solution to his problem?” Mathers asked the man and he shook his head.</p><p><br></p><p>Mathers patted his shoulder. “Don’t worry. You will find a solution soon.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.” He nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at them curiously but didn’t ask anything.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t know the man well enough for such a thing.</p><p><br></p><p>But later I asked Mephisto about the information and found out that his son had awakened a Sacred Gear which was actually killing him slowly.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s…</p><p><br></p><p>Compared to bastards like Bedeze who would throw out his own child because of having a weak Clan trait, this guy was doing everything he could do to save the life of his half-devil son.</p><p><br></p><p>It made me respect the man even just a bit.</p><p><br></p><p>I kept this at the back of my mind. I will keep an eye out for a way to help him out.</p><p><br></p><p>Getting a favour from one of the Top ten Rating Games players would always be a good thing.</p><p><br></p><p>There would be a celebration in the Grauzaberer Magician Organisation for me becoming an Ultimate Class Magician.</p><p><br></p><p>Originally Mephisto wanted to hold the party today itself but that would have required sending the invitations in advance and doing so would have sounded incredibly arrogant. Thankfully Gregory saved the day and stopped him from doing so earlier.</p><p><br></p><p>They sent the invitations as soon as I passed the exams.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a big event for any Magician Organisation after all.</p><p><br></p><p>But I did get a party somewhere else.</p><p><br></p><p>As soon as I returned home, what greeted me was a surprise party planned by Shuri.</p><p><br></p><p>“You know that I could have failed the exams too, right?” I shook my head with a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>“No way. Sensei’s magic is amazing. There was no way you could fail.” Akeno protested.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm hmm. Ace-kun’s magic is awesome. I knew you would pass for sure.” Lavy chimed in.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ufufufufu they had already started preparing for it yesterday when you told us the time for your exams. They never doubted that you would fail.” Shuri smiled as she patted my head.</p><p><br></p><p>I gave the two girls a light hug and then looked at Matsu who joined in.</p><p><br></p><p>“Congratulations Ace.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>We were still getting to know each other and while she was genuinely affectionate towards me and I knew it too, it was a bit hard for me to reciprocate to everything so fast. I was trying though but things like these take time.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Saelena Lucifer -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She finished her discussion with her fellow Satans, ironing out the last details of the Recommendation Games.</p><p><br></p><p>“I can’t believe they fell for it.” Serafall laughed. “They rejected it as we had guessed but the announcement of the Games must have caught them off guard. I am surprised they didn’t make more noise.”</p><p><br></p><p>“They cannot do that or they will earn the hatred of the public. Moreover, they still have the option of interfering.” Falbium explained, while still half asleep.</p><p><br></p><p>“Interfere?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I mean they could always send their own people to participate in the Rating Games. For them, this is just another way, more seats for their candidates. But we have already done what we could do. If the Low Class Devils want their chance, they will have to win it through merit. After all, there is no way we can identify and separate people or forbid them from participating. It goes against our whole argument.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It will be hard no doubt but not impossible.” She commented.</p><p><br></p><p>“Still thinking about that kid, huh?” Serafall asked.</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t reply.</p><p><br></p><p>She in fact did think of him.</p><p><br></p><p>For even a kid of that age to say such words… it has actually led her to review what they had been doing and she indeed found ways in which she could improve the lives of the common people.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well we can always see how he does in the Recommendation Games although I doubt he will win with the kind of competition we are expecting in the first Games. He might have better luck next time but now he will have no reason to complain even if he loses. I wonder how Mephisto is preparing his Ace.” Serafall said.</p><p><br></p><p>“I’m not sure about that.” They looked towards the speaker.</p><p><br></p><p>Ajuka?</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, do you know something?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Around twenty minutes ago, the said kid passed an Ultimate Class Magician assessment. He is now an official Ultimate Class Magician, the youngest person to be given this title. Mathers and Rudiger were among the judges. He was offered a position of a Bishop by Rudiger but he rejected.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Seriously? Ultimate Class? That kid? How old was he again?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Fourteen years five months old.” Ajuka read the file he had received from Mathers.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ultimate at fourteen… that’s… I only know of three people who have had such a feat.” Serafall looked at them.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>There have only been three Devils who had achieved such a level of strength at such an early age.</p><p><br></p><p>But unlike Rizevim, Ajuka and her, this kid was someone who wasn’t born different but attained this kind of power through sheer effort.</p><p><br></p><p>Ajuka played a video of the assessment for them to see.</p><p><br></p><p>One tiny figure commanding several titanic dragons to bring total devastation to the entire city. It was like a sight from a movie.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wow… that’s some crazy magic right there. Thankfully he had just played with bugs the last time.”</p><p><br></p><p>“At least the Recommendation Games will be interesting.”</p><p><br></p><p>She remembered the words of Mephisto from that day and a smile came on her lips.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, the Recommendation Games will surely be amazing.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Ace -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>It has been one week since I passed the Ultimate Class Magician exams.</p><p><br></p><p>This period of time was relatively peaceful for me as I kept myself locked away in the mansion doing whatever I needed to do.</p><p><br></p><p>Mephisto had given me two weeks off as he was preparing for the party. The guy was extremely giddy about having another Ultimate Class Magician in the organisation. </p><p><br></p><p>During this time I took a break from classes and spent time with people in the mansion.</p><p><br></p><p>I got the time to tell Matsu about my situation and how unusual my power was and she had been very supportive of me.</p><p><br></p><p>In return, she told me a lot about her world and was thinking of ways to help me out.</p><p><br></p><p>Many Devils had businesses in the Human World. In fact, all the Pillar Families, as well as famous devils, had huge businesses in the Human world and Matsu was planning to create one for me.</p><p><br></p><p>With Matsu’s specialties, she was planning to create a Tech Industry for us and I already had enough funds for her to go ahead.</p><p><br></p><p>The internet in the human world was not as advanced as my previous world. The Devil Net was more advanced due to Ajuka and his team of researchers but I knew of industries which would be rising soon enough and with Matsu’s powers and expertise, she could completely monopolise the entire industry.</p><p><br></p><p>With a little help from Mephisto, I got a place for ourselves and established my first company, Ace Solutions with Matsu as the chairman.</p><p><br></p><p>I gave her all the ideas I had from my world and she had plans from whatever she had seen Minaka Sahashi do in her own world.</p><p><br></p><p>We still needed to recruit people for our industries and I had a plan for that already.</p><p><br></p><p>I was planning to recruit low class devils from the underworld who do not get a good enough representation so that they can make deals and advance. In this way, I can create a support base for myself. But I will have to get to a good enough position for that. I didn’t want to use Mephisto’s influence for everything.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe I can find a way to strike a deal with Ajuka during the <em>sentence</em>.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, the date was coming soon.</p><p><br></p><p>I was shaken out of my thoughts by a summoning.</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly arranged everything and opened the portal.</p><p><br></p><p>On the other side was a face I had been waiting on for a while.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well hello Draco Malfoy. I was wondering when you would summon me. After all, you are already on your deadline for the payment. It is the tenth day after all.” I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>The man beside him clenched his wand but didn’t make any moves.</p><p><br></p><p>“What are you?” The older Malfoy asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my, where are my manners? I am Ace Belphagor. I believe you must have heard my name. As for what I am? I am a Devil.” I manifested my wings and both the father and son stepped back as the older of the two pointed his wand at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“I would advise you to remove the tip away from me. I don’t like being threatened.” I narrowed my eyes as I looked at the man as the temperature of the entire surroundings chilled. Mist appeared from his mouth and he quickly removed his wand.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good boy. Now… what is it that you desire?” I asked, putting up my best smile. “Power, wealth, women, position or information, I can grant you all for a suitable price of course. But first the payment which is due.” I put forward my hand.</p><p><br></p><p>The man quickly went to his desk and brought out a bag and threw it at me through the portal.</p><p><br></p><p>I checked it and found the amount.</p><p><br></p><p>The easiest five hundred galleons I had ever earned.</p><p><br></p><p>“Now tell me, why have you summoned me?”</p><p><br></p><p>“We want nothing.” The man said sternly and I was actually surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>He actually denied it.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! What a surprise? I actually thought you would want power and wealth obviously, knowing of your deeds. What a surprise?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I have nothing I want from you.” The man remained adamant but I could see the movements in the eyes of his son.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, if that is really the case then let it be. I seriously thought you would be interested in knowing how your family might suffer due to one of your mistakes but I guess you aren’t afraid of Voldemort so who am I to say anything.” I shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>As expected, that worked.</p><p><br></p><p>“What do you mean?” He asked, his eyes opening wide at the mention of Voldemort’s name.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you asking me for information?” I asked back.</p><p><br></p><p>He paused for a second, clenching his fist and gritting his teeth before nodding.</p><p><br></p><p>“Great! Let’s decide the price. This is a relatively small piece of information so nothing much. Twenty thousand Galleons. This much should be nothing for your family, right?”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s too much!” The little idiot shouted.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. It was too much. I in fact agreed more than anyone that it was too much… since Voldemort was already dead… but they didn’t know that so it was still a small price for them.</p><p><br></p><p>“How can I be sure that you are not lying to me?” The older man asked.</p><p><br></p><p>I shrugged. “You can always verify the information. It wouldn’t be hard to do so. So… Do we have a deal?”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded. “Yes.” he then looked at his son. “Leave the room, Draco.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But Father.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Leave!.. now.”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy was apparently not expecting such a reaction and hurried outside.</p><p><br></p><p>“Now that was rude. You didn’t need to scold the kid that much. He could have learned a thing or two which might have helped him in his life. Anyways, it is none of my business what you do to your family. I want my payment in a week.” I snapped my finger and sent a chilling wave. It basically did nothing but made him feel very cold for a second. “Or your entire family will suffer from Malediction.” His face paled and he quickly nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Great. So you see the thing is, you remember the Diary of Tom Riddle? The same one which you sent to Hogwarts this year in a certain someone’s basket?” I asked as he was shocked. “What? Why are you surprised? I know a thing or two. That’s my job after all. Anyways, that thing is called a Horcrux. You can search for it although I doubt you will find it easily. It’s a piece of magic, one of the worst kinds of magic, in which the caster cuts a piece of their souls and seals it in an object to tether themselves to the world of the living by using the life of another person. I won’t explain the details. But if you want to know then it will cost you more.”</p><p><br></p><p>His face paled as he understood the meaning of my words.</p><p><br></p><p>“Exactly. You fucked up. Now the thing is that if he had created only one of those then you might have lucked out as he could have died if his anchor was destroyed. But he created several of those. Some he gave to his loyal subordinates… some he hid in secret places. The one you had was created by him in his sixth year when he was a prefect. He used the life of Myrtle Warren, the one you all call Moaning Myrtle and used Rubeus Hagrid’s Acromantula as a diversion. It was the first of his anchors and you my dear Lucius… sent it to Hogwarts and let it be destroyed. I am not sure Voldemort would be pleased if he heard of it. I can obviously offer help… for a price.”</p><p><br></p><p>I let him suffocate in fear.</p><p><br></p><p>“That will be all. You will get your payment by tomorrow.” The man answered quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Great! Always good to see people keeping their side of the deal. I never like taking lives for broken deals ya know. It’s such a waste. Okay then. Good bye. See you soon.” I waved to him and closed the portal.</p><p><br></p><p>When it was closed I finally let out a laugh.</p><p><br></p><p>I am going to juice half of that idiot’s property and maybe Sirius would even throw a prize for me if he found out about it.</p><p><br></p><p>“What are you so happy about? Did something happen?” Matsu peeked from the door and asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Of course. I got some more funding for our company. Someone was kind enough to give me free funds and said that he will provide more in a week.” I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Really?” She asked, looking excited.</p><p><br></p><p>I took the bag and poured its contents on the bed as five hundred golden coins filled the bed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wow! Are those gold coins?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yup. Pure gold.” I replied.</p><p><br></p><p>I had them tested.</p><p><br></p><p>These coins weighed almost three times heavier than normal coins and when changed into gold, it was worth a lot more than just five pounds for one galleon.</p><p><br></p><p>With the amount I have right now, I could get hundreds of millions and Lucius was kind enough to provide me with more.</p><p><br></p><p>“Multiversal trades are really profitable, aren’t they?” She asked, turning towards me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, I prefer gold because currencies may vary from one place to another but gold almost always works.”</p><p><br></p><p>Right at that moment, I sensed another summoning.</p><p><br></p><p>Oh. These things were getting quicker.</p><p><br></p><p>I set up a barrier and Matsu knew what I was doing.</p><p><br></p><p>“Can I watch?” She asked, pleadingly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Excuse me?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Can I watch you make deals? I won’t interfere, I promise.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure. Although it would probably just be Dumbledore teaching me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I still want to watch.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright.”</p><p><br></p><p>She took a seat behind me and watched as I summoned the portal and sure enough it was Dumbledore.</p><p><br></p><p>By now I was kinda able to identify the regular summoners but it was still way off from being able to pinpoint them in this vast multiverse.</p><p><br></p><p>Dumbledore wasn’t one for talks so he continued his lessons.</p><p><br></p><p>It was vacation time at Hogwarts so I asked him if he could extend the class and he obliged.</p><p><br></p><p>The man really wanted to get the deal done.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Mephisto -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Have all the invitations been sent?” He asked Gregory.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I have sent invitations to all other Magician Organisations we are close to. The High Class Magicians of the Organisation were given one pass each and will get to invite one of their own guests. Apart from them, only the students from Ace’s class will be invited. They have also submitted the names of their guests.” Gregory offered him the list of the guests which he perused. “We can use this party as a chance for them to exhibit their talents and form contracts with talented Devils. Too bad that Ace himself is just a Low Class Devil or he would have gotten a lot of contracts.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, it’s only a matter of time. He will be becoming a Middle Class Devil in a year and a half. He will have all of that later.” He answered while his eyes stopped at a certain name on the list and a smile formed on his lips.</p><p><br></p><p>“Something attracted your attention?” Gregory asked, probably noticing his smile.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nothing. Just had a thought.” He waved his thoughts away and kept the file aside. “By the way, how is Georg doing?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh that boy always keeps himself locked away in his room. He is talented but never concentrates on anything. I am tired of reminding him to be honest.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Bring him to the party. Maybe it will do him good to have a competitor.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Competitor? Ace? I don’t think he is anywhere near that level….”</p><p><br></p><p>“I was talking about Lavinia and Akeno. Both of them are very talented. Especially Baraqiel’s daughter.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh. That makes sense. By the way, I have heard that Ace lives with a woman with unknown background and is opening a company?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. He does.”</p><p><br></p><p>“....Is she safe? I mean you already know how many people have tried to get their hands on him? And a woman with a completely unknown background coming out of <a href=\"https://nowhere….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">nowhere….it</a> is suspicious.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha oh don’t worry about her. I have had the chance to meet her and she is safe. Moreover, that kid would never allow anyone he doesn’t trust within ten feet of him until he absolutely has to. You underestimate how cautious that kid can be. They will never get him unless he wants them to get him.” He smiled, recalling that they didn’t even know what he looked like.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well if you say so. It just seemed a bit odd to me so I brought it up.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No, it’s fine. They are completely safe. You don’t need to worry about them.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay.”</p><p><br></p><p>With everything taken care of, he laid the file aside and waited for the next day’s party.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Minaka Sahashi -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“So a portal appeared in space and Sekirei Number Two just jumped into it? Not only that but there was a guy on the other side who could manipulate Ice and single-handedly subdued all of you?” He asked, disbelievingly.</p><p><br></p><p>The group in front of him looked down except Number Four who was glaring at him or perhaps just pissed off at her defeat.</p><p><br></p><p>But the matter was just that strange.</p><p><br></p><p>“All of you?” He asked again. “And you didn’t identify him?” An unknown Sekirei?”</p><p><br></p><p>How interesting!</p><p><br></p><p>As far as he knew and had researched, there were no other Sekirei apart from the one hundred and eight he had discovered in the ship on Kamikura Island.</p><p><br></p><p>The other seven ships had landed centuries ago and all of the residents had passed away. He had spent no effort investigating this.</p><p><br></p><p>He even had the rest of the Jinki in his possession, further verifying that none of the people from those ships had survived.</p><p><br></p><p>Was there something else he didn’t know?</p><p><br></p><p>And this person used two different types of powers.</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>The portal could be explained with the use of a machine of some kind….or maybe two people were cooperating together.</p><p><br></p><p>“And this unknown person, Sekirei, was working with Number Two to steal a Jinki from MBI?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Actually….” Number One hundred and five started speaking but hesitated.</p><p><br></p><p>“What?”</p><p><br></p><p>“When Matsu jumped inside, she knocked him down and….”</p><p><br></p><p>“And?”</p><p><br></p><p>“She was winged.”</p><p><br></p><p>“....huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“She was winged by the unknown guy.”</p><p><br></p><p>“....I don’t get it. Didn’t you say that the guy was a Sekirei? Then how could he wing another Sekirei?”</p><p><br></p><p>At that time, Takami entered with a disc.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have received the footage of the entire thing.” She played the disc and they watched.</p><p><br></p><p>One moment Number Two was running and then suddenly out of nowhere, a portal opened.</p><p><br></p><p>“Play the entire chase again.” he ordered and they observed.</p><p><br></p><p>He watched closely.</p><p><br></p><p>Number Two was running. She dodged an attack from Number one hundred and five which shattered a trash can, sending the contents flying.</p><p><br></p><p>A piece of paper flew and stuck to Number Two’s face and she fumbled to remove it while running but the very next moment a portal opened from somewhere.</p><p><br></p><p>There was indeed the light which was seen during the winging of a Sekirei confirming the words of Number One hundred and five.</p><p><br></p><p>Number Four reached there and directly attacked the boy on the other side of the portal only to be countered and thrown away.</p><p><br></p><p>The rest of the group drew their weapons but he threw something outside which flew away and then just froze her along with everyone in the team. Most of the cameras in the area were destroyed in the attack.</p><p><br></p><p>And then the portal had closed just like it had opened.</p><p><br></p><p>It was really something he hadn’t seen before.</p><p><br></p><p>He was absolutely sure that he didn’t know this….whatever he was.</p><p><br></p><p>Had some other countries obtained some data and secretly developed something?</p><p><br></p><p>Was Number Four collaborating with them?</p><p><br></p><p>But he was sure of one thing….this kind of power was not something ordinary Sekirei could achieve.</p><p><br></p><p>The ease with which he took down Number Four would put him above the leagues of the normal Sekirei.</p><p><br></p><p>And even the Ice Attack only froze everyone so that they couldn’t break out….even Number Four couldn’t break out of it. There was only one Sekirei who could completely dominate Number Four like that.</p><p><br></p><p>But she never participated in anything.</p><p><br></p><p>He suddenly recalled something.</p><p><br></p><p>“Something flew out of the portal before he froze everyone. It looked like a paper of some kind. Find whatever it was.” he ordered.</p><p><br></p><p>They looked at him weirdly.</p><p><br></p><p>“You want us to find a piece of paper in the entire town?” Takami asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well dear, that’s our only clue.”</p><p><br></p><p>After all, why would someone like that just randomly throw pieces of papers at his enemies before finishing them?</p><p><br></p><p>And wasn’t Number Two hit by a paper on her face too?</p><p><br></p><p>“You’re crazy.” Takami scolded and left the room.</p><p><br></p><p>But he made sure that the Disciplinary Squad would spend every moment of their time searching for the pieces of power.</p><p><br></p><p>Even if that was nothing, they still needed to be punished for failing a task.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Ace -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I finished my class with Dumbledore.</p><p><br></p><p>Potions is….not my cup of tea.</p><p><br></p><p>Oh I could understand the subject and even do well but it just wasn’t cut out for me.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, I needed to know enough to learn even the basics of Alchemy.</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully, Dumbledore covered it with Transfiguration lessons on the side, polishing my skills.</p><p><br></p><p>He might be wary of me but the guy never shirked on the deal. I could respect him for that.</p><p><br></p><p>“That will be all for today.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You can summon me tomorrow. I will try to keep the day free.” I replied.</p><p><br></p><p>He just nodded and threw a look at Matsu who had been sitting behind me obediently.</p><p><br></p><p>“She’s not a devil.” I smiled. “She’s….”</p><p><br></p><p>“I’m Ace’s wife.” She jumped excitedly and I facepalmed while the old man looked confused.</p><p><br></p><p>“Not really.” I shook my head.</p><p><br></p><p>Why was I even explaining anything?</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. Bye.” I waved him off and closed the portal, leaving the man in confusion.</p><p><br></p><p>“You did wing me, you know.” She pouted.</p><p><br></p><p>I let out a sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>She was getting too influenced by Shuri’s teasing of me.</p><p><br></p><p>“So that’s how you learn Magic. That old man seemed strong.” She changed the topic, seeing me not replying.</p><p><br></p><p>“He is probably the strongest wizard of his world.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! Even stronger than you?” She asked genuinely curious.</p><p><br></p><p>A smile came to my face. “I could take a hundred of him alone and win.”</p><p><br></p><p>Her eyes lit up at my proclamation and the feeling of being adored by someone like this….wasn’t bad.</p><p><br></p><p>I sensed another summoning at this moment.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, what was up with today?</p><p><br></p><p>This was already the third.</p><p><br></p><p>I waved my wand and things were arranged and the room was back in order.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Matsu and it looked like she wanted to keep watching.</p><p><br></p><p>I shrugged and summoned a portal again.</p><p><br></p><p>This time there was a completely new face on the other side of the portal staring at the portal in surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>He was a handsome young man with black hair and violet eyes. A bit scrawny, having little muscle.</p><p><br></p><p>He was wearing a casual outfit which was a red jacket with a black shirt underneath and grey trousers, though he has occasionally worn other clothing.</p><p><br></p><p>It looked like he was hiding somewhere.</p><p><br></p><p>Shaking my stray thoughts, I put on the show. “Hello there. Who are you and what is it that you desire?”</p><p><br></p><p>He just kept on staring at me in shock.</p><p><br></p><p>“Come on pal. I don’t have the whole day, ya know. You summoned me here so at least introduce yourself. Who are you?” I asked, a bit impatient.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“I….my name is….Lelouch Lamperouge.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Say what?”</p><p><br></p><p>____________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x_________________________________</p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><a href=\"https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><strong>Ace is now an Ultimate Class Magician, a somewhat big deal so yay.</strong></p><p><strong>Lucius will be shitting bricks and paying Ace for making him shit bricks.</strong></p><p><strong>And finally we have the would-be Demon King appearing before a devil.</strong></p><p><strong>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>",

And this feeling was increasing with each passing second.</p><p><br></p><p>At last I couldn’t hold on and let out a scream at the top of my lungs.</p><p><br></p><p>My demonic power surged beyond my control and I felt everything go white.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Mephisto -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the giant pillar of Ice before him in awe.</p><p><br></p><p>The entire area surrounding it had turned into ice for kilometres, erasing all signs of life everywhere but the pillar itself felt as if it was alive or rather as if it was housing something inside it.</p><p><br></p><p>It was as if a dangerous beast was hibernating there.</p><p><br></p><p>He had no idea what it was that the kid had made or drunk but that kind of effect, it was increasing his power at a terrifying rate.</p><p><br></p><p>The surroundings were getting chillier by the moment but it was probably the only thing which also told him that the kid was still alive.</p><p><br></p><p>His Demonic Power was already at the High Class level, even towards the higher end but now it had comfortably crossed into the Ultimate Class range and was steadily increasing.</p><p><br></p><p>Mephisto, despite his thousands of years of life, had no idea what the kid had made or drunk but it was far from simple. He thought about the clues but only knew that it was of a Demonic Nature, the blood of some Demonic Beast which he had purified.</p><p><br></p><p>Was it the blood of the original Satans?</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>He shook off that thought as soon as it came.</p><p><br></p><p>Those things didn’t have this feel.</p><p><br></p><p>Not to mention none of them had this element either.</p><p><br></p><p>The pits were a dangerous place which any devil would think twice about before venturing but this kid said that he had been hunting there. Could it be something he found out inside?</p><p><br></p><p>Mephisto hadn’t heard of any such Demonic Beast coming out though.</p><p><br></p><p>Alchemy was something which was rarely used in today's world.</p><p><br></p><p>There was also the Enchanting he said he was dabbling in.</p><p><br></p><p>Just how in the seven heavens did he learn all this?</p><p><br></p><p>Did he make all this by himself? All these new spells?</p><p><br></p><p>If so then his talents would be no less than Ajuka himself.</p><p><br></p><p>That and his rapidly increasing power was sure to make him someone to not be trifled with.</p><p><br></p><p>He put several barriers around the place to stop anyone from disturbing them as well as monitor the condition of the kid.</p><p><br></p><p>The process lasted for eight hours and he sat there, looking at the changes in the pillar. A thick mist had spread all over the area for kilometres straight.</p><p><br></p><p>Everything had stabilised and he could feel the kid alive inside.</p><p><br></p><p>The Demonic Power had finished rising and was almost in the mid ranges of the Ultimate Class, something which would put him in the top hundred or so people even in the Devil faction.</p><p><br></p><p>And he was only fourteen this year.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly he felt a great urge to laugh out loud when he thought about the faces of those fools in the Underworld and especially that arrogant kid Bedeze when Ace makes an appearance in the Recommendation Games.</p><p><br></p><p>It was going to be glorious.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly there was a cracking sound and he looked up to see the pillar crack a bit. The cracks expanded throughout the entire length of the pillar as if a spider web.</p><p><br></p><p>He quickly put a barrier in front of him and right at that moment, the entire pillar shattered with a loud bang.</p><p><br></p><p>The mist cleared slowly and he could finally see Ace, standing there.</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t have any clothes on his body but apart from that, he looked the same except, there was a certain coldness to his whole demeanour. </p><p><br></p><p>He looked at his hand and then pointed it towards the direction of the empty frozen barrenlands.</p><p><br></p><p>Before Mephisto could say anything, he felt Ace’s Demonic Power flare a bit and the entire area he was pointing at was covered in huge spikes of ice as far as eyes could see.</p><p><br></p><p>Mephisto watched in awe.</p><p><br></p><p>He had used no wands or any kind of Magic Circles.</p><p><br></p><p>He did it all with a wave of his hand.</p><p><br></p><p>As if satisfied with his feat, he brought out his wand from his trunk and with just a flick, the ice around him, transfigured into a set of clothes on his body.</p><p><br></p><p>Mephisto walked towards him and he sensed his approach and turned back to face him.</p><p><br></p><p>“You seem to look satisfied with the results of your experiment.”</p><p><br></p><p>The kid looked at him for a moment and then bowed deeply. “Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>Mephisto waved his hands off. “It was a deal and I was paid for it. You don’t have to thank me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You remained here and protected me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I was just curious and was protecting an investment. I did promise you that I would protect you as long as you teach in the Grauzaberer organisation, didn’t I? I am just keeping my side of the deal here.”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy stood up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s go. You still have a class to teach tomorrow.” He said and the boy nodded as he activated the Teleportation Magic Circle.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Ace -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>It had been three weeks since I had consumed the modified Demon’s Extract and the changes it did to my body were beyond anything I had expected.</p><p><br></p><p>First of all, there were no voices in my head driving me insane and that was a huge plus. It seemed that Aqua’s Purification worked.</p><p><br></p><p>But that was also the cause of the changes during the consumption of the Teigu.</p><p><br></p><p>As there was no consciousness to control the power of the blood, it acted rampantly inside my body.</p><p><br></p><p>Normally my Demonic Power would have suppressed it but in this case, it had merged with my Demonic Power instead and I got an insane affinity with Ice Magic.</p><p><br></p><p>I could make Ice out of nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>And freeze almost anything with just a thought.</p><p><br></p><p>The best part was that if my guesses were correct, then this affinity could even be passed on to my children. This had become an actual part of me.</p><p><br></p><p>The direct effect of this was that I had grown strong both in body and magic.</p><p><br></p><p>My body was already decently strong and now had a slight increase in power too.</p><p><br></p><p>The real growth was in my Demonic Power which grew in tandem to the changes in my body finally reaching the Ultimate Class range.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, I didn’t have the fine control over my power which I had gained through practice. I was putting most of my time in getting that control back with the exercises that Dave had taught me.</p><p><br></p><p>He must be worried because I hadn’t returned there for so long. I was avoiding going back so as to not get followed and reveal my identity but now, with Mephisto in the know, I was planning to go and pay Dave a visit.</p><p><br></p><p>Before coming back, I had made a point of putting a marker for a space in the Underworld so that I could travel there at any time using Shambala without having to go through any standard procedure which would get me caught.</p><p><br></p><p>My power was now at a level where I could at least somewhat protect myself in the Underworld.</p><p><br></p><p>It wasn’t at the level where I could not be pushed around though.</p><p><br></p><p>For that I needed to master my Ice Magic completely and look for other methods to become stronger.</p><p><br></p><p>In these past few weeks I had been thinking about how to break through the limits of this body.</p><p><br></p><p>According to what I had found, Ultimate Class was attainable, at least in physique if not in Demonic Power through training alone.</p><p><br></p><p>It was apparently possible to train Demonic Power to increase but that method was unknown.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>It was actually unknown.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the method Dave taught me could only help me to a certain level. The increase became negligible after reaching one's limit.</p><p><br></p><p>Demonic Power didn’t work like a muscle. One could obviously refine their finesse but not the amount with simple training.</p><p><br></p><p>Expending it completely or fighting life and death battles didn’t work or the ones who did so in the Rating Games, would have had insane amounts of Demonic Power… but they didn’t.</p><p><br></p><p>This was one of the reasons why several of the Top Rating Game players resorted to using the King Pieces.</p><p><br></p><p>They just couldn’t break the natural limit to their Demonic Power.</p><p><br></p><p>And for this very reason, reaching Satan Class was not possible if you were not born with the talent for it.</p><p><br></p><p>Age did increase the Demonic Power of an individual but this too varied from person to person or some of the Lords of the House wouldn’t be a High Class Devil.</p><p><br></p><p>Hell, even Bedeze or Roygun wouldn’t have only High Class level powers because they did train… extremely hard to win in the Rating Games… and yet, according to their words, Diehauser Belial was a monster similar to the Satans.</p><p><br></p><p>There were only seven Satan Class and above Pure Blooded devils currently alive and three of them were Super Devils. That tells everyone how hard such a feat is.</p><p><br></p><p>The thought that all Devils are lazy is utterly stupid. After all, this was an entire race of millions of living beings.</p><p><br></p><p>Saying all of them are lazy would be the most stupid thing ever.</p><p><br></p><p>There were many devils who worked extremely hard and yet couldn’t increase their power.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone encountered a bottleneck or limit in their powers.</p><p><br></p><p>And what I wanted was to find ways to break through this with external stimulus just like the Demon’s Extract.</p><p><br></p><p>I guess I will have to ask the Emperor to search for the people who make Teigu and such weapons for their method. I haven’t had much contact with him except the executions where I was allowed to collect the criminals as marbles. I had over two thousand of those by now.</p><p><br></p><p>But that was when I reached the limit of my power.</p><p><br></p><p>For now, I had more than enough on my plate to train.</p><p><br></p><p>With my increased power, I could easily keep the Holes open for a long period of time as well as open two of them simultaneously, although to do so was incredibly strenuous. But this was something I was planning on working on.</p><p><br></p><p>With this power, I have the confidence to fight in the Recommendation Games and secure a place for myself.</p><p><br></p><p>All I needed to do was hone this power to keep up with people who come after me when I finally expose myself.</p><p><br></p><p>Mephisto didn't ask me anything about the incident. The only thing he asked me was if I was willing to teach Alchemy and Enchanting subjects too.</p><p><br></p><p>I told him that I needed some time to prepare. He was fine with it because the deal was for me to teach only Transfiguration Magic here. The only reason I accepted was because it would give me access to the resources of the Organization.</p><p><br></p><p>In the last three weeks, I was able to keep the Holes open for a longer period of time and thus my lessons with Dumbledore increased.</p><p><br></p><p>The old guy wanted to get done with the lessons as soon as he could so he didn't have any problems increasing the time.</p><p><br></p><p>This led to the rapidly increasing proficiency of my Transfiguration Magic.</p><p><br></p><p>I was now at the Master level.</p><p><br></p><p>There was still a lot I could learn from Dumbledore though but he was getting me started on potions as one needs a good grasp on potions to learn Alchemy.</p><p><br></p><p>By my estimates, I would be able to learn a decent amount of Alchemy to start.</p><p><br></p><p>There were also the Enchanting books which I wanted to use..</p><p><br></p><p>Sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyday, my work keeps on increasing even more.</p><p><br></p><p>So many things to do.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe I should have pushed for a Time Turner from Dumbledore. I did ask the old guy for it but he didn’t agree at all and I was in an urgent need back then…</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps Sirius could do something about it… or someone else?</p><p><br></p><p>I was distracted from my thoughts by the knock on my door.</p><p><br></p><p>I waved my wand and packed things back into my trunk and opened the door to see Akeno waiting there.</p><p><br></p><p>Since my mishap with the Purification Magic, I had moved from the dorms where I was living and stayed in a mansion a bit far away.</p><p><br></p><p>The other residents of the mansion were the Himejima mother and daughter pair and Lavinia who asked to be with me when I was moving.</p><p><br></p><p>I was given a side of the mansion to myself and there were servants for everything but there was one thing which Shuri always insisted on doing on her own, cooking the food.</p><p><br></p><p>She always cooked food for us on her own.</p><p><br></p><p>She had found out about me, not my real identity but the fact that I hunted in the pits gave her an idea of the kind of life I was living so she was treating me with extra kindness. This went for Lavinia as well.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn't tell her anything as I could see that her feelings were actually genuine.</p><p><br></p><p>She was also teaching me Purification Techniques so she was my teacher in a way so her treatment didn’t seem odd.</p><p><br></p><p>Akeno on the other hand asked to learn magic under me when she found out that I taught in the Grauzaberer Organisation.</p><p><br></p><p>She was very impressed by the time I had saved her back then.</p><p><br></p><p>Her parents had a talk with Mephisto and I got myself an extra student.</p><p><br></p><p>She got along very well with Lavinia too.</p><p><br></p><p>She apparently didn’t have many children her age to play around with and enjoyed her time with Lavy.</p><p><br></p><p>“Okaa-sama is calling you for dinner, Ace-sensei.” She said, bowing lightly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is Lavy there already?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded and I patted her head much to her pleasure.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl had gotten attached to Lavy and me since the incident.</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded. “Alright, let’s go.”</p><p><br></p><p>I followed her for dinner where both Shuri and Lavy were already waiting for us.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sit Ace-kun. I will serve dinner.” Shuri said as she got up.</p><p><br></p><p>I took a seat beside Lavy who was very excited.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ace Ace, I heard that you applied for an Ultimate Class Magician Examination. Is it true?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I want to give it a try.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So awesome. You will pass for sure.” She cheered.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, my next goal was to gain an Ultimate Class Magician certification from the Organization.</p><p><br></p><p>Now that I had the raw power for it, I wanted to get it done as soon as possible.</p><p><br></p><p>It will open a lot of doors for me.</p><p><br></p><p>As I have learned, having more power and a higher position always helps get things done.</p><p><br></p><p>I still had one and a half years for the Recommendation Games but an Ultimate Class Magician Examination was still doable.</p><p><br></p><p>I would have more leverage if I had the tag when I went to serve my punishment under Ajuka.</p><p><br></p><p>That reminded me.</p><p><br></p><p>The date for the sentence has been decided to be one month from now.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am sure you will do very well in your tests, Ace-kun.” Shuri smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm hmm, Sensei’s magic is very amazing.” Akeno said as she took a bite of her food.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will be working part time in the Underworld, a month from now.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh? The Underworld?” They looked at me, surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I was offered… an internship at Lucifaad by… Ajuka Beelzebub, so I would like to reschedule our classes on Purification Magic.” I told Shuri.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s… amazing. I might not know a lot about the Devil side but I have heard that the current Beelzebub is a master of magic. You will learn a lot from him.”</p><p><br></p><p>I just nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>I still had no idea what exactly he wanted from me.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why I wanted to get the Ultimate Class label beside my name.</p><p><br></p><p>As the name suggested, they were the absolute top of any Magician Organisation. In fact, even Top level Magician Organisations had only a couple of them, the highest being the Golden Dawn with seven such people.</p><p><br></p><p>Grauzaberer on the other hand only had two. Mephisto and Gregory Faust, the father of Georg Faust and the descendant of the first Faust. The only reason it could keep up with the other organisations was due to Mephisto and his connections.</p><p><br></p><p>After getting such a rank, one could even make a Magician Organisation of their own.</p><p><br></p><p>For this reason, such a test had to be monitored by the Ultimate Class Magicians from outside of Grauzaberer.</p><p><br></p><p>The only reason I had to wait was for Mephisto to gather them for the test.</p><p><br></p><p>I was already figuring out what spell to use and had practised something during the last two weeks.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s fine. We can discuss the timings for your classes after your tests. You need to prepare for the exams right now. And when you pass….let’s have a picnic with everyone of us.” She smiled slightly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Really?” Lavy brightened up.</p><p><br>Akeno looked happy too although she was shy and didn’t speak out.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, that depends if Ace-kun wants to.” She looked at me slyly.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded defeatedly.</p><p><br></p><p>“How were your classes, Lavy-chan?” She asked Lavinia who excitedly repeated everything and the whole atmosphere of the room became weirdly homely.</p><p><br></p><p>I left for my room after dinner to get back to my daily classes with Dumbledore.</p><p><br></p><p>The potions classes needed materials which he bought for me as a part of his deal but never provided me with anything extra.</p><p><br></p><p>I will need to strike a deal with Sirius to get myself all the plants.</p><p><br></p><p>It was after the class that I felt another summoning.</p><p><br></p><p>I got into my usual getup and responded to the summoning.</p><p><br></p><p>My holes were now the size of a small window.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a familiar face on the other end.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hello Kazuma. What can I do for you today?” I asked with a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>“New game. Do you have new games?” he asked, hurriedly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously. I have plenty of them. I brought out a bunch of games from my trunk and showed him and gave him a thumbs up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Great. Here is the list of things from Wiz’s shop and prices beside it.” He gave me a list of things.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the piece of paper.</p><p><br></p><p>It was in Japanese.</p><p><br></p><p>I brought out my Devil Phone and translated the text.</p><p><br></p><p>The top range products were very good.</p><p><br></p><p>Dragon Slayer weapons, Holy, Cursed and Demonic Weapons and armours, different accessories with amazing effects. The only thing stopping me from buying everything was the price.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will need to make a payment in gold so you will need to negotiate with Miss Wiz.”</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t know if I could get an Adventurer’s Card but I will consider it later.</p><p><br></p><p>“Aye aye Boss.” he saluted and ran off with a summoning contract. I let out a sigh and closed the hole.</p><p><br></p><p>I was summoned soon enough and the other side of the hole had changed completely. It was the interior of a shop with different types of equipment.</p><p><br></p><p>Kazuma was standing in front of a woman in her early 20s with fair skin and a curvaceous figure. She had brown eyes and straight brown hair reaching down to the front of her shoulders, further behind her back and slightly curling at the tips. Her fringe covered her right eye with a single ahoge that arced off the top of her head.</p><p><br></p><p>This was Wiz, the Lich with the epithet of Ice Witch and one of the generals in the Devil King’s army.</p><p><br></p><p>The final boss in the beginner village.</p><p><br></p><p>“It really happened.” The girl exclaimed as she stepped in front of Kazuma in a defensive position.<br><br></p><p>I didn’t do anything to threaten her either as I raised my hands. “Now now, I don’t intend to fight, Miss Wiz. I am just here to buy stuff. I give you my word.”</p><p><br></p><p>She paused at my promise and then relaxed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes yes Wiz-san. Ace is a good guy. A bit of a profiteer but he is not bad.” Kazuma tried to mediate the situation and thankfully, Wiz was one of the most understanding people in this world so she calmed down as soon as Kazuma explained everything.</p><p><br></p><p>“So you want to buy things from my shop?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.” I nodded, clearing the situation quickly. “I was just hoping that I could pay using gold directly so that I don’t need to convert the money I have into the currency of this world.” I explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see.” She thought for a while and nodded. “I can accept that.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Great! In that case, can you explain the functions of some of these equipment to me? There are a few things I would like to buy but I have questions about some of them.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure.”</p><p><br></p><p>What came after was an hour long explanation about some top tier equipment.</p><p><br></p><p>I chose over a dozen items.</p><p><br></p><p>A few sets of rings and necklaces and a set of equipment for myself including a full set of light armour made from Dragon leather made from the leather of a Black Dragon and highly resistant to magic, a set of wands and staffs and a set of dozen swords of each attribute. There were also several potions for myself.</p><p><br></p><p>The rings had several functions.</p><p><br></p><p>One of them had a presence concealment and it also hid the magic power of the user from being sensed which was a great thing for the current me.</p><p><br></p><p>The second ring had two spells imbued in it. Drain Touch and Mana Drain.</p><p><br></p><p>The third ring had a Sense Danger Skill.</p><p><br></p><p>It was the final set of rings which were probably the best.</p><p><br></p><p>They contained… nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, they had no spells in it.</p><p><br></p><p>But they had another function.</p><p><br></p><p>They could store one spell inside it for the user to use.</p><p><br></p><p>And I knew exactly the spell to use.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally the necklace had a barrier function which can protect the user from an attack but would need to be recharged after use.</p><p><br></p><p>The swords, while not at the level of Gram, were still good quality stuff, similar to the High Class Hunters from the Pits. I kept most of them for trades with other contractors.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you for your patronage.” Wiz bowed and I smiled at her too.</p><p><br></p><p>“The pleasure is all mine. I look forward to more business with you later on.” Then I turned to Kazuma and passed him two games instead of just one. “Thank you for your hard work, Kazuma. Here’s something from my side.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ohh!” He exclaimed happily, holding the ring in front of his face and then looked suspiciously at me. “What do you want?”</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled at the guy.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is why I like working with you, Kazuma-san. You really understand me. I need another minor favour from you.”</p><p><br></p><p>He continued looking at me without any words and I didn’t need to use Legilimency on him to know what he was thinking.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry. It’s not something hard. You just need to make Aqua store ‘Resurrection’, ‘Purification’ and ‘Break Spell’ spells inside these rings. I will even throw a tablet for you if you do this.” I smiled at the guy.</p><p><br></p><p>“A PC.” He bargained.</p><p><br></p><p>“Agreed.” I quickly agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>Compared to the Resurrection Spells, this was nothing.</p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://“Again….be\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">“Again….be</a> sure that Aqua stores the correct spell in the rings because if they don’t work or if you try to cheat me….” I left the words hanging.</p><p><br></p><p>“Deal.” he gave me a quick thumbs up.</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled, happy at the transaction and closed the portal, bidding a goodbye to the two.</p><p><br></p><p>With my trade for the day done, I went on to practise my magic till there was another knock on the door.</p><p><br></p><p>I already knew who was on the other side this time so I opened the door without even asking.</p><p><br></p><p>Lavinia had come to sleep.</p><p><br></p><p>She had done this often since her birthday and I didn’t deny her.</p><p><br></p><p>We changed and got ready for bed.</p><p><br></p><p>She, as usual, took one of my shirts as her nightdress and laid beside me, snuggling to my side, making me smile.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good Night, Ace.” She whispered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good Night, Lavy.” I replied.</p><p><br></p><p>This life was….not bad.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Najenda -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Once more she stood in front of the Emperor who was becoming more and more mysterious everyday.</p><p><br></p><p>Beside him stood the Great General Budo and on his other side was the former Prime Minister who had served during the previous Emperor’s reign, Chouri.</p><p><br></p><p>In the past month alone, these three had gone on a quest to purge all the filth from the Empire. Everyone was stunned by the sheer brutality exhibited by the kid who was only eight years old.</p><p><br></p><p>But this very sense of decisiveness was something which had won him the respect of the generals of the Empire.</p><p><br></p><p>Except the ones who had sided with Honest, the rest had become a die hard supporter of the Emperor and his new rule, especially with the show of power against the criminals during the execution.</p><p><br></p><p>The Guardian of the Empire’s word had spread throughout the capital city and made people quiver in fear. No one knew what kind of being it was, or even if it was a human or a Danger Beast. All they had seen of it was just the hand which seemed to be of a human and from the looks of it, a human male’s hand.</p><p>‘</p><p>That said, the power it had exhibited was frightening.</p><p><br></p><p>Was that black stick in his hand a Teigu?</p><p><br></p><p>There was no information about such a Teigu even in the Encyclopedia of Teigus.</p><p><br></p><p>It was understandable because who in their right mind would disclose the information about their top weapon to outsiders.</p><p><br></p><p>Today, however, it didn’t look like there was an execution. Even the people gathered in the room were relatively few.</p><p><br></p><p>There were only an odd fifty or so people in the room.</p><p><br></p><p>Her thoughts were interrupted by the voice of the Emperor.</p><p><br></p><p>“Welcome our loyal soldiers.” He spoke and they kneeled to show their respects.</p><p><br></p><p>He had earned this much.</p><p><br></p><p>“Rise up.” He spoke again and they looked up from their positions.</p><p><br></p><p>“Today….we have called you all here to offer you a chance.”</p><p><br></p><p>He spoke and she noticed the odd looks of the Prime Minister and the Great General.</p><p><br></p><p>“You all have been selected to be a part of a team….directly under the Guardian of the Empire.”</p><p><br></p><p>She found herself frozen in her spot at the sudden announcement.</p><p><br></p><p>There were some similar looks from the other people in the room too.</p><p><br></p><p>Although, not all looks were similar.</p><p><br></p><p>There were some who looked excited at the prospect.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at the blue haired girl whom she had noticed in all the previous meetings and came to know her as Esdeath Patras, a survivor of the Northern Clans, looking at the Emperor with excitement in her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>The Emperor continued. “If you accept, you can stay in the room but if you have any doubts, you should leave right now. Be reminded that once you join the team, you will be giving up all rights to interfere with the political system of the Empire forever. You won’t even be able to participate in the activities of the army and thus have to give up your positions. So be careful when you choose.” He said as he looked over at the people in the room.</p><p><br></p><p>Murmurs ran throughout the room.</p><p><br></p><p>It was General Liver who took the initiative as one of the oldest of the ones gathered who asked the question from their side. “My apologies, Your Majesty, but….what will be the job of this team?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No need to apologise. It is only natural to know what you are signing up for. The work of this team will be to protect the Empire from all kinds of threats as well as help improve the quality of life in the Empire through the knowledge of the guardian.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The….knowledge?” he asked, confused.</p><p><br></p><p>“The Guardian possesses knowledge far beyond what any of you can comprehend. Even the power he used to finish off the traitors was something which can be taught.” The Emperor dropped the bomb.</p><p><br></p><p>She found her breath halted.</p><p><br></p><p>But the next words from the Emperor chilled their hearts. “But do be warned. Should any of you ever become a danger for the Empire or try to betray the Guardian….your ends will be far worse than even Honest.” The Emperor looked at them with narrowed eyes. “So be careful when you choose. Do not worry, all of you are our trusted people. We will not blame you for your choice and neither will the Guardian.”</p><p><br></p><p>There was an eerie quietness in the room.</p><p><br></p><p>One guy stood up and bowed.</p><p><br></p><p>The Emperor nodded. “You may leave.”</p><p><br></p><p>The guy left the room and soon, one after another, several others followed.</p><p><br></p><p>By the end, only around half of the people were left in the room.</p><p><br></p><p>She hesitated but decided to stay and see what this was all about. If there was really a chance to do more for the Empire, she would pledge herself to the task without any hesitation.</p><p><br></p><p>After all, in the last month, the actions of the Emperor, gruesome they might be, had given her hope that the Empire can go back to being the peaceful home she had experienced during her childhood.</p><p><br></p><p>“Have you chosen?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes!” All of them answered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Very well, in that case, we shall summon our Guardian.”</p><p><br></p><p>The Emperor brought out what looked to be a piece of paper from under his cloak and held it close to his head. They had already become familiar with the process and sure enough, a hole opened in the space in front of them.</p><p><br></p><p>But this time it was different. Unlike the previous times where the hole was very small, almost the size of a human head, this time, it was far larger, almost the size of a small window.</p><p><br></p><p>And on the other side of the hole, was a figure.</p><p><br></p><p>She blinked her eyes twice at the figure she saw.</p><p><br></p><p>….a boy?</p><p><br></p><p>Pink hair and gold eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked like a simple young boy around fourteen or fifteen years of age.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh….this is more than I was expecting. Have all of them agreed to your terms?” The boy asked, looking at the people in the room.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. We told them all about the basic conditions which you laid. You can tell them the rest.” The Emperor said enthusiastically.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you. In that case I will take over.” The boy smiled and turned towards the crowd. “Hello to you all. First of all, let me introduce myself. I am Ace, the Guardian of the Empire….and I am not from your world.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Ace -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the stunned faces of the people in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am a Devil from the Underworld.” I continued. “And the Emperor, a good friend of mine, has a deal with me to protect the Empire and make it prosper. I might be able to fight armies alone but I cannot make the entire Empire <a href=\"https://prosper….at\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">prosper….at</a> least not with my current abilities. And thus….I asked for a team for myself as a part of the deal and you….are invited to become a member of this team. Any questions till here?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>The people looked at each other and then one of the older ones, a silver haired guy, stood up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sir Guardian.” He bowed. “I thank you for lending a hand to the Empire. What I wish to know is what exactly would we be doing?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Your name?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“My name is Liver.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, General Liver. Nice to meet you. You and anyone who decides to join the team will be given knowledge of different worlds and will assist in the development of the Empire using said knowledge. I cannot tell you all more about this till you agree to become a part of the team.”</p><p><br></p><p>Another person raised their hand.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes?”</p><p><br></p><p>“What is the catch?”</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled at the question.</p><p><br></p><p>“A very good question. Remember, nothing in this world is free. This is the principle I  live by. Once you join my team, you will get certain perks but also have similar restrictions and even more responsibilities. As per my deal with the Emperor, you will only answer to the Emperor and me but….” I paused and looked at everyone in the room and continued, “No one will be able to order you except me….not even the Emperor.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Preposterous!” The man beside the Emperor shouted.”Are you sullying the name of his Majesty? Who do you think you are?”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the guy.</p><p><br></p><p>Great general Budo, the strongest man in the Empire and a hardcore loyalist of the Emperor and the Royal family. I knew this type of reaction would be inevitable but I needed to make my point clear so that no one could question and interrupt my work later on due to their own dumb ideas of self righteousness..</p><p><br></p><p>“I am the guy whom your Emperor called for help because you all failed at your job.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man gritted his teeth but couldn’t retort.</p><p><br></p><p>“As for my words? Those were the exact terms for the contract with the Emperor. He wants me to protect the Empire….not him. Unlike you buffoons, he is someone who puts his people above his own life, a true King in making, which is the only reason I am even willing to make a contract with him for so long. My duty is to protect the Empire and make it prosper. If someday, anyone….and I mean anyone becomes a danger to the peace and prosperity of the Empire, I will eliminate them….even the Emperor.”</p><p><br></p><p>Lightning crackled around the man at the last words and ice manifested around me, suppressing everyone in the room except the Emperor.</p><p><br></p><p>He was <a href=\"https://strong….no\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">strong….no</a> doubt. But….I was stronger.</p><p><br></p><p>“Stop this!” The Emperor shouted, making the guy back down and I reigned back my aura too.</p><p><br></p><p>The Emperor looked towards Budo.</p><p><br></p><p>“We were the one who asked Ace for this kind of deal.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Your Majesty!”</p><p><br></p><p>The Emperor raised a hand, stopping him from saying anything. “If we hadn’t discovered the plot of Honest, something which Ace pointed out to us, we would have become a puppet at the hands of the criminal….and harmed our people, the Empire which our ancestors had left to us would have been destroyed by our hands….that is not something we can allow to happen. We understand your feelings about protecting us and are very grateful for it….but this is something we need to do….as the Emperor. Ace will not harm us. We trust him.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man shut his mouth after being told off.</p><p><br></p><p>It was someone else who had been silent till now, who spoke. The Prime Minister, Chouri. “My apologies your Majesty, Sir Guardian, General Budo didn’t mean anything bad. It’s just that after Honest….these kinds of words….and for someone other than the Emperor to have this kind of <a href=\"https://power….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">power….it</a> makes people worry….despite your intentions.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ah….yes. That’s quite understandable.</p><p><br></p><p>I turned towards the Emperor and spoke. “Tell me something….if you wanted a rundown village, would you plot and scheme to get it?”</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone in the room looked at me strangely except for a few.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. That would be….foolish.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Exactly.” I turned towards the Prime Minister who had an extremely ugly look on his face. “I can access an almost infinite number of worlds, some stronger, some weaker, some with no life while some where literal Gods live….so tell me, why would I be interested in taking over your little Empire? It’s just….foolish.”</p><p><br></p><p>Not giving them any other chance to speak, I continued. “With the knowledge in my possession, I can make an Empire far more advanced than this with absolute ease. But I am not interested in ruling. The things I want, I can get by the current setup without harming the Empire. So….if you want, you can worry and spend your nights without any sleep or….you can just put aside your fears for a while and see my work first. Any doubts?”</p><p><br></p><p>The guy kept quiet.</p><p><br></p><p>Good.</p><p><br></p><p>I turned towards the people in the room again. “If you choose to work for me, you will become strong, learn things which will make you able to take down even Super Class Danger Beasts alone and bring the Empire to much greater heights but….you will have similar restrictions as well. You will not be able to participate in any political or private job or use the information you learn here for private profit. You will have to follow my orders without questions....no matter what. If I tell you to kill, you kill, if I tell you to die, you die. I will permit no questions. Understood”</p><p><br></p><p>The group nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“That said, I am not a heartless monster….I do not have the habit of harming my subordinates without any reasons. But if you ever….betray the Empire or me….the type of death Honest got….would feel like a blessing to you.” I stared at the group. “Anyone who doesn’t want to stay….step aside.”</p><p><br></p><p>Slowly, around six people stepped aside.</p><p><br></p><p>I waited for a minute more but the rest didn’t move.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright.” I brought out my wand and their eyes widened while some of them faltered but I wasn’t going to kill anyone. “Obliviate.”</p><p><br></p><p>The six of them paused.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the Emperor and nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“General Budo, see them out. Please assure that they get proper rest and don’t talk to them about today’s matters.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man looked at the Emperor and then at me for a second longer than I would have liked and then bowed to the Emperor as he led the obliviated group outside.</p><p><br></p><p>It was then that the silver haired girl in the group which stayed back spoke. “What did you do?” Her eyes widened as she realised that she had said those words out loud. “I apologis….”</p><p><br></p><p>“I erased their memories of this meeting. They will remember nothing of today.” I replied, making the eyes of several people widened.</p><p><br></p><p>“Your first task is to establish a base according to the requirements I have stated on the land given by the Emperor. As for your joining gifts.” I took out the swords I had bought from Wiz and presented to them. “From today on, you are the members of my team, the Ace in the Hole.”</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>A day has passed since the creation of ‘Ace in the Hole’.</p><p><br></p><p>Managing things on the other side was hard, especially when I wasn’t there all the time to monitor things.</p><p><br></p><p>The Prime Minister didn’t say it out loud but he didn’t trust me….and neither did most of the people who stayed back.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, several of them wanted to act as spies for the Empire despite the words of the Emperor.</p><p><br></p><p>That sly Prime Minister had sent his own daughter, Spear as a spy to monitor the work of my team, all in the guise of showing a sign of cooperation towards me. </p><p><br></p><p>I need to convince and make them loyal to me as well as teach them a few things. Fortunately, I had the methods for that.</p><p><br></p><p>I let out a sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>So many things to do….</p><p><br></p><p>I needed someone to help me out with everything.</p><p><br></p><p>I trusted Lavinia but she was a bit naive and….too young. I didn’t want to drag her into this for a while. I need others too.</p><p><br></p><p>There was also the upcoming Ultimate Class Magician Examination in a few days.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, there was no easy way to become strong.</p><p><br></p><p>All the work which I put in the Empire right now will yield far greater results later on.</p><p><br></p><p>That world is almost unexplored with great potential. Their civilisation is not as advanced as many others and is a place where I can easily establish a solid footing.</p><p><br></p><p>This much work….is reasonable.</p><p><br></p><p>I shook my head and got up. I didn’t have time to slack off.</p><p><br></p><p>At this time I sensed another summoning.</p><p><br></p><p>The summonings were getting more frequent now.</p><p><br></p><p>I opened the portal and on the other side was a new face.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a slender boy with sleek white-blond hair, cold grey eyes, a pale complexion and rather sharp, pointed features.</p><p><br></p><p>The surprising thing was the clothes he was wearing.</p><p><br></p><p>I was quite familiar with those clothes.</p><p><br></p><p>Hogwarts Uniform.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy looked stunned at the appearance of the portal and stumbled and fell on his back.</p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://“I….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">“I….it</a> works. It actually works!” he exclaimed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes yes, it works. Get over it. I am a very busy man. Who are you and what is it that you desire?” I asked, casually.</p><p><br></p><p>“You….what are you?” The boy questioned, pointing his finger at me.</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled, putting on a show. “I….am a Devil. Now, on with it? Why have you summoned me?”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy was shit scared when he heard what I was but slowly, a look of smug arrogance came on his face as he pointed his finger at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Shut up. I have summoned you and you will serve me. Stop ordering me around.” The boy snarned.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“About that….I am not that type of devil. If you want something from me, you will have to make a deal. Strength, knowledge, tools, everything for a reasonable price. That said….” I let out a bit of my Demonic Power on him, making him crumble on his knees. “I don’t like being ordered around by no name little twerps like you. Now….who are you?”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy shook in fear. “I-I am Draco Malfoy.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Oh….</p><p><br></p><p>That makes so much sense.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hoh. So tell me Draco Malfoy, what is it that you desire?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Power….make me the strongest wizard alive.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The strongest wizard alive? You mean stronger than Dumbledore and Tom Riddle?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Tom Riddle?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The guy who calls himself Lord Voldemort. It’s actually an anagram of his real name Tom Marvolo Riddle.”</p><p><br></p><p>His face paled at the information.</p><p><br></p><p>“Anyways, I can easily do that.”</p><p><br></p><p>I actually could. Just give him a spoonful of the Demon’s extract and boom.</p><p><br></p><p>But I had something better than that in mind.</p><p><br></p><p>“I can give you a method of becoming strong enough to knock out Dumbledore in a single attack. But….what will you pay? Oh and before you say the same old cliche things, I don’t trade in souls. Money, knowledge and tools….those are the only things I am interested in. So….go and tell your father to summon me. And I will make the deal.” I snapped my fingers and several ice butterflies were created around him and flew out in the dorms.</p><p><br></p><p>Those were actually summoning contracts transfigured into butterflies.</p><p><br></p><p>The Slytherins were the richest of the Wizarding world and had the most resources too, the perfect kind of people to make deals with.</p><p><br></p><p>Let’s see who summons me next….</p><p><br></p><p>The guy in front of me tried to speak but quickly held his tongue with a single glare from my side.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh….and this consultation will cost you five hundred galleons. I expect the payment in a week or your entire family gets a Malediction Curse. Bye.” I closed the portal without giving him any chance to speak. The five hundred galleons will make sure that he consults his father.</p><p><br></p><p>The Malfoy House is loaded….</p><p><br></p><p>I wonder just how much I can swindle out of them?</p><p><br></p><p>As I was making plans, I sensed another summoning.</p><p><br></p><p>Wow.</p><p><br></p><p>Two in a row.</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly collected myself and opened the portal and got ready to do my usual presentation.</p><p><br></p><p>What I didn't expect was someone diving directly into my face through the hole and falling on me.</p><p>There were a lot of noises in the background from the other side of the portal.</p><p><br></p><p>But I wasn’t concentrating on that.</p><p><br></p><p>I felt something soft on my lips.</p><p><br></p><p>The room was lit by a flash of light as the figure wrapped its arms around my neck and I realised that the figure was kissing me.</p><p><br></p><p>I held back my instinct to freeze everything in my surroundings.</p><p><br></p><p>Lavinia and the Himejima family were still in the building.</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly gained my composure and pushed the figure.</p><p><br></p><p>Taking a clear look, she was a girl with burnt orange hair with long side plaits and orange eyes. She was wearing a loose-fitting white dress which resembled a cheongsam and glasses.</p><p><br></p><p>However the most eye-catching thing about her were the golden lights which almost seemed like wings behind her.</p><p><br></p><p>For a moment, I had thought she was an Angel.</p><p><br></p><p>I just stared at her in awe for a moment before my attention was diverted by the noise behind her.</p><p><br></p><p>“She escaped there.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Is it another one of her accomplice? A space type ability?”</p><p><br></p><p>There were several girls and behind them, men in black suits who were pointing at the portal.</p><p><br></p><p>“Move aside.” A greyish haired, black clothed girl commanded as the others moved aside and she looked at us inside the portal. “How interesting.” She licked her lips in a way which gave me very mixed feelings.</p><p><br></p><p>And then without any warning, she drew a sword and dashed towards the portal.</p><p><br></p><p>“How annoying?” I stopped the thrust sword with a reinforced Ice Sword, making her eyes widen. She wasn’t weak….but she wasn’t that strong either.</p><p><br></p><p>I put more power behind my attack and sent her flying into a wall nearby.</p><p><br></p><p>“Captain!”</p><p> </p><p>“Impossible?!”</p><p><br></p><p>They faced me with their weapons drawn.</p><p><br></p><p>I sighed and put aside my sword, drawing my wand as I sent several of my summoning contracts through the portal.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl from before got up quickly and shot towards me once more.</p><p><br></p><p>I was however done playing so I directly froze the entire group up to their necks.</p><p><br></p><p>Looking directly into the eyes of the grey haired woman, I spoke.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t bother. You’re weak.”</p><p><br></p><p>Her pupils shrank and then her face morphed into a crazy look as she burst out into a maniacal laughter.</p><p><br></p><p>I just closed the portal in front of her.</p><p><br></p><p>As for my questions, the girl here could answer me.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at her to see her kneeling before me.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at me with eyes full of adoration and spoke. “What are your orders, my Ashikabi?”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?!”</p><p>___________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Finally done.</strong></p><p><strong><br>We had Ace making some great deals in this chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Kazuma is a great guy to make deals with.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ace finally has a team in the Empire but has a very long road ahead to make full use of them.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>We also got Draco Malfoy getting a summoning contract and all the great possibilities which come with it.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Finally, we got a new character out of the blue.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Any guesses who she is?</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The next chapters are going to be a lot of fun.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br><br><br><br><br></p>",

I couldn’t contact the Emperor right now but I knew that this night would not be peaceful.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, not being able to do anything, I decided to check on my rewards from this.</p><p><br></p><p>I got four new Teigu.</p><p><br></p><p>The first one was, the One Cut Killer, Murasame. A Teigu known to kill any biological lifeform in a single cut and it even destroys their souls.</p><p><br></p><p>The second one was the Power Surging Balzac.</p><p><br></p><p>To be honest, this thing was an anomaly in itself. According to me it was extremely underrated due to several facts.</p><p><br></p><p>First was because people of that world couldn’t use two Teigu together without causing some kind of irreversible harm to themselves and thus they could never figure out the true Potential of this Teigu.</p><p><br></p><p>Balzac was an utter hack which could… unlock 100 percent of the hidden potential of an individual.</p><p><br></p><p>There was however a catch.</p><p><br></p><p>It only worked for the body and mind and not for energies like mana or demonic power. Maybe it had something to do with the fact that it was made without considering Magic.</p><p><br></p><p>But even then, it was extremely useful too if used to learn something. Normally, we only use a small part of our mind and body but with this, we can access most of its strength.</p><p><br></p><p>This is even greater for me, a natural born devil as I can achieve extremely high levels of physical and mental power.</p><p><br></p><p>Another flaw of this is that… it’s ugly.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. This thing looks so fucking ugly, I wouldn’t be caught dead in this. It sticks out like a sore thumb and people would obviously try to find out what it does.</p><p><br></p><p>So I can only use it in case of extreme emergencies or when learning something.</p><p><br></p><p>The third Teigu was, the Dimensional Formation, Sambhala.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a Teigu which could manipulate Space and Time and allow the user as well as others to teleport from one place to another. I still had to test its limits but I had several ways to use this one in my mind.</p><p><br></p><p>And finally, I looked at the last one, a sealed golden container in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>Demon God Manifestation, Demon’s Extract.</p><p><br></p><p>The thing attracted me as if calling out to me. I quickly used Occlumency to shield myself and found that it was indeed a type of mental attack.</p><p><br></p><p>No wonder this thing could drive people mad in that world, a place with no concept of mental defences, when consumed.</p><p><br></p><p>It would be similar to having that voice inside my head.</p><p><br></p><p>Anyone without proper control would be rendered insane by the constant murmuring inside their heads.</p><p><br></p><p>In return for taking such a risk, the user would get insane amounts of power.This thing made Esdeath, a human with a wall level to small building levels of strength into someone who could freeze even time.</p><p><br></p><p>This was without a doubt the strongest of the Teigu overall.</p><p><br></p><p>But to drink it without any kind of preparation would be foolish.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t have some kind of stupid plot armour to help me out of this situation.</p><p><br>Even Esdeath, someone with an insanely strong will also had a change of personality. It might be due to the power but at the same time it could also be due to the effects of the Teigu itself.</p><p><br></p><p>I was not going to let myself get caught unguarded.</p><p><br></p><p>So I quickly made a plan.</p><p><br></p><p>This Teigu was made from the lifeblood of a Super Class Danger Beast who lived in the northern part of the Empire.</p><p><br></p><p>So maybe it was the leftover will or soul of the Danger Beast in the Blood which caused this effect. If so, then maybe the will could be removed or sealed to get this magic without any kind of side effects.</p><p><br></p><p>I need to work on my Occlumency Skills till I can bear it for the worst case scenario while at the same time seeing what I can do to remove the taint of the Danger Beast in the blood.</p><p><br></p><p>There are ways to purify or remove leftover will or souls from objects in this world. It was in fact one of the most common types of jobs offered to Devils of higher ranks - to remove the curse or leftover wills from a magical object.</p><p><br></p><p>I needed to research more.</p><p><br></p><p>But regardless, my harvest today was enormous.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t expect the Emperor to make such a deal with me.</p><p><br></p><p>It does provide me with a way to expand my influence in the other world.</p><p><br></p><p>That world had so many interesting things.</p><p><br></p><p>Danger Beasts and the country which made the Teigu which can be classified as top tier artifacts even in this world.</p><p><br></p><p>I needed to plan everything.</p><p><br></p><p>With this thought in mind, I let myself fall asleep.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I was in front of Mephisto the next morning.</p><p><br></p><p>Last night the Emperor hadn’t contacted me anymore. He might have had a lot of things to take care of so I didn’t bother him either. Things like these couldn’t be rushed.</p><p><br></p><p>In the next few months, he will have to remain under protection at all times so that he isn’t assassinated by someone from the Prime Minister’s side.</p><p><br></p><p>Until the people around him were completely purged of rebels and corrupt officials, he had to remain under guard.</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully he had the current strongest man of the Empire under him.</p><p><br></p><p>General Budo was the current strongest man in the Empire because the current Esdeath was still only fourteen years old or so.</p><p><br></p><p>That was not to say that she was weak. She was currently a captain in the Empire’s army and was easily influenced.</p><p><br></p><p>I was going to take her in as a part of my team.</p><p><br></p><p>As for the Emperor, I did make some preparations for his protection.</p><p><br></p><p>He currently had two full vials of the Luck Potion to protect him which should keep him out of trouble for a full twenty four hours.</p><p><br></p><p>This was an investment.</p><p><br></p><p>Mephisto’s words broke me out of my thoughts.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have two pieces of news for you. First of all, your request for the High Class Magician Promotion Exams have been accepted. You just needed agreement from three Ultimate Class Magicians or a dozen High Class Magicians with a decade long experience at the High Class level in the organisation to get the certification.\" He brought out a badge from his drawer. “There you go. Over fifty of your students agreed to your promotion already so now you are officially a High Class Magician… congratulations.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the badge in surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>“That easy?” I couldn’t help but ask.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh? High Class certification is still quite low for what you have achieved. Creating a whole new branch of magic is something only a handful of people have done in this world. This alone was enough to promote you. Not to mention, your… older students didn’t want to learn from someone who didn’t even have a High Class certification. Overall, congratulations. You are now officially a High Class Magician.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.” I looked at the badge in surprise while he continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“Excuse me?” I asked, narrowing my eyes at his following words.</p><p><br></p><p>He repeated his words and I frowned.</p><p><br></p><p>“Two months of public service in the ‘Research and Development Department’ under Ajuka Beelzebub?” I asked, suspiciously.</p><p><br></p><p>“He doesn’t want any information about your magic you don’t want to disclose and just wants a sharp mind like yours in some of his own projects. As you know that his Evil Pieces also changes its targets. A joint research to see if any changes could be made into the Evil Pieces if your magic is used. You just have to assist him.”</p><p><br></p><p>I thought about the whole thing and sighed. Mephisto took this chance to explain everything in detail.</p><p><br></p><p>“I personally think you should take up on this opportunity. Working even for two months under him will help you develop a lot as a magician. You wouldn’t believe how many magicians would give up almost anything for such a chance. Apart from that, Ajuka is not the type to nitpick about other things as long as you do your work properly so you don’t have to worry about your disguise in front of him.”</p><p><br></p><p>I almost jolted at his words and then realising the situation I merely shook my head.</p><p><br></p><p>Obviously he knew.</p><p><br></p><p>It would be strange if he didn’t realise months after taking me in. He’s someone older than even the previous Satans. It would be strange if he didn’t know.</p><p><br></p><p>“How long?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh? Ah, I knew it from the first day itself.” He shrugged. “But our deal doesn’t require you to reveal your identity so why does it matter to me?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Were you not curious?” I asked, while trying to probe surface thoughts with legilimency, not exactly probing directly to avoid messing things up.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am. Just to clarify, I still don’t know who you are, only the fact that you are under a disguise at all times. In my long life I have learned to control my curiosity quite well.” he laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the man strangely.</p><p><br></p><p>He passed on the documents to me regarding my public service sentence.</p><p><br></p><p>“I did negotiate something from your side. Your <em>public sentence</em> will be known as an internship so as to avoid negatively affecting any chances of promotion for you. This was the best I could get from them. In return I got something else… you get a place in the Recommendation Games which are being held a year and half later to showcase your strength and get a Middle Class promotion.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Recommendation Games?” I asked, raising my eyebrows.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh right, you don’t know about that. Haven’t been keeping up with the news of the underworld lately, have you?” he then went on to explain the details of the games which had been introduced due to some random bullshit I had spewed back then.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Damn… I had no idea.</p><p><br></p><p>Mephisto continued while I was in thought. “To be honest, I could just give you a recommendation myself but I think you should take this opportunity to showcase your strength and talent in front of the whole Underworld so that other native Low Class Devils get a better representation in future.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I thank you for your offer but I think I will participate in the games.” I said after some thoughts.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nothing is free huh?” he laughed, shaking his head in amusement. “Well, it’s a good policy after all so you’ll hear no complaints from me.”</p><p><br></p><p>I thought of the exams in a year and a half and there was no way I was going to win there with my current strength. Even if I were to train day and night, I still probably won’t make it, knowing how many people will be participating in such a competition.</p><p><br></p><p>To win it, I would need an edge. I still don’t know if they will allow special weapons in the competition or if there was a no kill rule so Teigu might not help.</p><p><br></p><p>At least not all of them.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally deciding on something I looked up at Mephisto.</p><p><br></p><p>“I… have a request to ask of you. If you want, I can pay for it.”</p><p><br></p><p>He raised an eyebrow but signalled me to go on.</p><p><br></p><p>“I wish to learn exorcism and purification techniques if possible.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Exorcism? Where did that come from?” he asked.</p><p><br></p><p>I took a deep breath, “I have something personal which needs purification.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It contains the leftover will of a Demonic Beast. I wish to purify it.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man scratched his chin. “Hmm. Devils are not exactly known for purification techniques. Curses are different matters. But I can talk to someone if you want to purify it urgently. As for learning such things, it might take some time. You can decide what to do for yourself.”</p><p><br></p><p>I thought for a few seconds and nodded. “I will have it purified first and will learn the purification techniques too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Great. I will arrange for it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Payment?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>He smiled. “How about you tell me your identity?”</p><p><br></p><p>I raised an eyebrow. “I thought you could control your curiosity.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I said I can control it better than most but why should I if I don’t have to.” he shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>I sighed. I will have to reveal it in a year and half anyways and this guy… he’s done a lot for me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Very well. Once the deal is complete, I will tell you my identity.”</p><p><br></p><p>He smiled brightly. “Well we have a deal then. Always have fun making deals with you.”</p><p><br></p><p>We talked about a few things and I left to prepare for the next class.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Najenda -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The Empire was in an uproar since yesterday when the Emperor suddenly decided to take matters into his own hands. All the loyal generals of the Emperor had gone on a crusade, taking out Prime Minister Honest and all his supporters.</p><p><br></p><p>There was obviously a lot of resistance but none stood any chance.</p><p><br></p><p>Looking at the man standing behind the Emperor currently, like an immovable wall, she recalled the amount of destruction this man was capable of causing.</p><p><br></p><p>Great General Budo. The commander of the Imperial Guards and the highest ranking officer of the Empire.</p><p><br></p><p>After seeing him in action today, she didn’t doubt his powers for a single instant.</p><p><br></p><p>Every person which the Prime Minister could rally with him had been crushed instantly and captured.</p><p><br></p><p>Hundreds of people kneeled in the courtyards and in front of the whole group was the Prime Minister or rather the former Prime Minister Honest.</p><p><br></p><p>Both his arms were torn apart.</p><p><br></p><p>It happened before he could even use his Teigu.</p><p><br></p><p>Apart from him, his entire family, distant and close, were all in the group and this was still just the first group of people who were inside the Imperial Palace.</p><p><br></p><p>There would still be hundreds even thousands of others who will be brought to justice later.</p><p><br></p><p>She hadn’t expected the Emperor to be this decisive at such a young age.</p><p><br></p><p>The Emperor looked at them and stood up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Since everyone is already present here, we shall conduct the trial.” He brought out several vials from his pocket. “General Budo… use a drop of this on the tongues of every person before you question. It will make sure that they cannot lie.”</p><p><br></p><p>What!</p><p><br></p><p>Was there such a thing?</p><p><br>Was it something new made by the Empire?</p><p><br></p><p>But looking at the General’s face, she didn’t think even the man himself knew.</p><p><br></p><p>He still ordered his subordinates to follow the procedure.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next few hours, everyone was questioned and to their horror, none of them could lie no matter what.</p><p><br></p><p>They all were forced to speak their true thoughts regardless.</p><p><br></p><p>Every one of them accepted their crimes and even provided the proof themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>It was honestly frightening to see such a power.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, it was time for the judgement to be served.</p><p><br></p><p>The Emperor stood up once more. He had tears in his eyes as he looked at the crowd in front of him but he wiped it off quickly. It was easy to forget that he was still a kid whose parents were killed by these people due to the determination he had shown today.</p><p><br></p><p>“All of you have plotted against the Empire and its peace. For that… there can be only one punishment. Death. But you people have done something far worse than traitors before you for you have the blood of even my parents, the previous Emperor, on your hands. This is a crime which cannot be punished with just a simple death. So… we leave your executions to the Guardian of the Empire. Repent in Death and be honest citizens in your next lives.”</p><p><br></p><p>Guardian?</p><p><br></p><p>She was not the only one who was surprised at the proclamations.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the Great General Budo was puzzled.</p><p><br></p><p>The Emperor didn’t pay any attention to anyone and brought out a piece of paper from his pocket and held it close to his head and closed his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>All of them waited to see what he was doing and then it happened.</p><p><br></p><p>A rift appeared in space and slowly turned into a portal.</p><p><br></p><p>It was as if someone had torn open a hole in space.</p><p><br></p><p>General Budo quickly stood in front of the Emperor but the Emperor himself stepped around him to the front and stood facing the strange hole.</p><p><br></p><p>“We offer you the souls of these traitors. Take all of them and bring prosperity and peace to the Empire.” The Emperor looked at the hole and spoke.</p><p><br></p><p>A hand appeared out of the hole, carrying a stick of sorts and waved it and… in front of the shocked eyes of everyone present, all those criminals… hundreds of lives… were all turned into marbles and fell on the floor.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at the scene with her mouth wide open as a chill ran down her spine.</p><p><br></p><p>The hand waved again as the marbles flew to it and another hand appeared with a small pouch which collected them all.</p><p><br></p><p>What was it?</p><p><br></p><p>A danger beast?</p><p><br></p><p>A Teigu?</p><p><br></p><p>As if to answer their questions, a voice sounded from the hole.</p><p><br></p><p>“It shall be done.”</p><p><br></p><p>The voice seemed like that of a young boy but the Emperor looked at the place with complete seriousness.</p><p><br></p><p>With the words said, the hole closed back.</p><p><br></p><p>They still kept staring at the empty space in awe and wonder.</p><p><br></p><p>It seemed as if the Empire still held a lot of secrets and Honest had really underestimated the powers behind the Empire.</p><p><br></p><p>At this point she could only hope that these forces bring about the good of the people of the Empire now because she couldn’t even imagine what this kind of power could do if they intended harm.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Acelin -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the marbles in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>Six hundred and thirty three souls.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t know how strong I will become if I consume this but one thing I know for sure is that I will definitely lose control. There was a reason why the devils were so crazy back in the day.</p><p><br></p><p>A rapid increase in power by eating souls has consequences.</p><p><br></p><p>Moreover it’s not like there are no limits or the Satan Descendants would have easily become Satan Class… which they didn’t.</p><p><br></p><p>To use all these, I need a better method. Rituals sound good. More research will be needed for this.</p><p><br></p><p>I will hold on to these souls and any more that will come till then.</p><p><br></p><p>Another thing which has been worrying me a lot is that I haven’t been able to get any contracts from other worlds apart from these two.</p><p><br></p><p>I have been regularly throwing a pamphlet in randomly opened holes to contract other worlds but there has been no progress yet.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe I should take some emergency measures.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the trunk where I kept my stuff and after a minute of thought, I opened it to bring out a vial of luck potion.</p><p><br></p><p>I took one sip, enough to last me for the next hour and started opening holes and throwing Summoning Contracts into them one after another.</p><p><br></p><p>I left everything to luck.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>Two days had passed.</p><p><br></p><p>I used the luck potion method for the last two days and I feel like my luck potion was wasted.</p><p><br></p><p>The Emperor is still cleaning up the Empire but I gave him some books and a list of people who needed to be recruited as the first batch for my team.</p><p><br></p><p>I was currently going to Mephisto for something.</p><p><br></p><p>On reaching his office, I knocked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Come in.” His voice came from inside and on opening the door to the office, I saw that he was not alone.</p><p><br></p><p>Lavinia was there.</p><p><br></p><p>“Come on in Ace. We were just waiting for you.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at him with a questioning expression on which he explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“The thing about learning purification. I talked to a friend of mine and he knew someone who is an expert at these matters. We can go there and get the item you wanted purified as well as have a talk about the lessons. Take whatever you need. We need to head out in an hour.”</p><p><br></p><p>So fast?</p><p><br></p><p>But then again, it was better if it was fast.</p><p><br></p><p>“I’m ready. I already have everything I need.” All of my important belongings are in the shrunk trunk hanging on my necklace in case I ever needed to flee.</p><p><br></p><p>The last trunk which I had buried in the forest near the pit, the super large trunk which I had obtained from Dumbledore was still there as I hadn’t been able to bring it back.</p><p><br></p><p>I needed to go back there once more and get it as well as meet Dave again.</p><p><br></p><p>He must be worried.</p><p><br></p><p>“Great. In that case, let’s leave. I also have a meeting with that acquaintance of mine. Lavinia can also get out and see a new place.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Lavy who looked very excited at the prospect of going to a new place and nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>We teleported out of the organisation building.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>The scene in front of our eyes changed. I looked around and it was an orchard of sorts.</p><p><br></p><p>“Where are we?” I asked, looking around the place.</p><p><br></p><p>“Japan.” Mephisto said as he led the way. “My friend has already had a talk with someone. I just need to drop you and Lavinia there.”</p><p><br></p><p>Japan?</p><p><br></p><p>The country where all the bullshit in this world apparently happens.</p><p><br></p><p>I was making a point to avoid this place as much as possible but it looks like I was dragged here anyways.</p><p><br></p><p>Just who are we going to meet?</p><p><br></p><p>A shrine appeared in front of us.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the old devil and he answered my unasked question.</p><p><br></p><p>“She’s a shrine maiden. They are extremely well versed in Purification.”</p><p><br></p><p>I waved away my stray thoughts.</p><p><br></p><p>We are just meeting a Shrine Maiden.</p><p><br></p><p>Nothing bad will happen.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>There must be thousands of Shrine Maidens in this country.</p><p><br></p><p>No reason to be tense.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, we were just meeting a random Shrine Maiden. What could possibly go wrong?</p><p><br></p><p>We were meeting a random Shrine Maiden, right?</p><p><br></p><p>I suddenly realised that he didn’t tell us the name so I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“What’s her name?”</p><p><br></p><p>Before he could answer, we saw a girl running directly towards us, tears in her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Help! They… those people will kill Okaa-sama.” The girl shouted and sure enough a couple of men in kimonos ran out of the shrine, chasing after the girl.</p><p><br></p><p>FUCK!</p><p><br></p><p>I jinxed it.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ace, take them down. Just make sure they are able to answer questions. Be careful. They are jutsusha from their uniforms. Lavinia, protect the girl.” Mephisto ordered as he himself took action, erecting a barrier around the place.</p><p><br></p><p>Jutsusha were japanese practitioners or spell users, basically the japanese version of Magicians.</p><p><br></p><p>These people wielded swords and were running towards us.</p><p><br></p><p>“Devils! Move away. This is not your matter.” One of them shouted but I had already taken action.</p><p><br></p><p>With a wave of my hand, the nearby tree turned into a wave of bees and swarmed them.</p><p><br></p><p>They were not expecting this as they waved their swords to fend them off while some were taking out some kind of talismans but I wasn’t about to give them any chance.</p><p><br></p><p>I transfigured the ground beneath their feet, making a pit and they fell down, destroying their balance. Another wave of my hand ensured that the soil had returned and transformed into hardened concrete around them, leaving only their heads out.</p><p><br></p><p>“Please….help my Okaa-sama. She is hurt. Those people stabbed her.” The girl held my sleeve and pleaded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Where is your Mother, kid?” Mephisto asked.</p><p><br></p><p>She pointed towards the direction and quickly led us there.</p><p><br></p><p>On reaching there, we saw a woman lying in a pool of her own blood.</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly checked her breathing.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Is she?” Mephisto asked.</p><p><br></p><p>I shook my head.<br><br></p><p>“NOOOOOOOOOO!” The girl bawled as she threw herself on the body of the woman.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tch… he owes me for this.” Mephisto clicked his tongue. “Move child. There is still a chance to save her life.”</p><p><br></p><p>Lavinia quickly held the girl and Mephisto brought out his Evil Pieces.</p><p><br></p><p>A Bishop Piece was brought out and it floated over her before entering her body. A light shone around her.</p><p><br></p><p>This was the first time I was watching someone use an Evil Piece before.</p><p><br></p><p>A few seconds later, the woman opened her eyes and Lavy released the girl who immediately jumped at the woman.</p><p><br></p><p>“Geez, what a mess. You two talk to her first. I will inform my friend and her husband about the situation.” Mephisto bailed out on us.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the woman who was currently hugging the crying girl and looking at us in confusion and had an urge to bang my head on the wall.</p><p><br></p><p>Just where did I get stuck?</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm, hello. I am from the Grauzaberer Magician Organisation and I was here to get something purified. We saw those people chasing her and she requested for help and…” I explained the situation to her in brief as a look of understanding came to her face.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. I thank you for saving my daughter’s life. You don’t need to be so tense. I might have been reincarnated as a devil but it’s better than being dead. You and your guardian have saved our family a lot of pain. I am sure Baraqiel will not mind either.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I… you are welcome.” I replied awkwardly and then something stuck me. “Excuse me, who?”</p><p><br></p><p>No way this was her.</p><p><br></p><p>The woman smiled at my expression. “My husband Baraqiel, a cadre of the Fallen Angels.”</p><p><br></p><p>That fucking bastard Dumbledore gave me fake Luck Potions.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ufufufufufu you don’t have to be worried. I don’t think he would be angry at you all. After all you saved my and my daughter and my life.”</p><p><br></p><p>She laughed but I could sense that she was still worried from taking a slight look at her surface thoughts.</p><p><br></p><p>I still nodded nonetheless.</p><p><br></p><p>“I… we will give you both some space then. Come Lavy.” Lavy nodded and we left the room.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Azazel -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He teleported to the Shrine where Brarqiel and his wife lived.</p><p><br></p><p>Almost half an hour ago he had received a message from Mephisto whom he had referred to Shuri Himejima for some purification.</p><p><br></p><p>Some jutsusha had attacked Shuri Himejima and her daughter and killed Shuri and were chasing her daughter and now she was a Devil… just want kind of mess was this?</p><p><br></p><p>As he neared the building, he was met with a weird scene.</p><p><br></p><p>Mephisto, along with two kids, were standing in front of several people who were buried till their necks in hard concrete.</p><p><br></p><p>“Azazel, next time you refer me to someone, make sure there are no hidden trials. At my age, my heart doesn’t take such surprises well.” The old devil greeted him.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am almost as old as you.” He retorted before looking at the captives. “How did you get them in there like that?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, it was Ace who took care of them. I just asked him to leave them in a condition to answer questions. They are all yours now.” Mephisto waved his hand and stepped aside.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the two kids behind him. So this was Ace, the new genius Magician who created the Transfiguration Magic, a completely new type of magic.</p><p><br></p><p>Azazel had heard about the boy through many of his contacts and there were even some people from Grigori who wanted to assassinate the kid before he could grow into something big but Mephisto’s stance made every one of them hesitate.</p><p><br></p><p>Seventeen bases of three Magician Organisations were destroyed by Tannin as a warning. Such a retaliation was not expected by anyone as assassination attempts at talents of the other organisation were more common than most people thought.</p><p><br></p><p>Sure two of those organisations were small fries but the last one was anything but.</p><p><br></p><p>The Wizards of Oz were a troublesome foe and Mephisto didn’t give them an inch. This greatly discouraged any foes from trying their luck.</p><p><br></p><p>But right now was not the time to test the golden boy of Mephisto. He turned his attention towards the captives.</p><p><br></p><p>“Who sent you to kill Shuri Himejima and her daughter?” He turned and asked the captives.</p><p><br></p><p>As expected, no answer came.</p><p><br></p><p>One of them even had the guts to spit towards him.</p><p><br></p><p>He shook his head and turned towards Mephisto. “Can you send the kids away?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Them? Don’t mind them. Both of them can take it.”</p><p><br></p><p>He shrugged. “Your wish then.” With that said, he smashed the jaw of the guy who had spit at him, breaking it and making him howl in pain.</p><p><br></p><p>The rest of the group’s face hardened but took on an enraged look.</p><p><br></p><p>“We will sooner give our lives than answer you, Monster.” One of them roared.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tch… this is why I don’t like dealing with these kinds of people. They think dying is the worst thing which can happen to them.” He summoned a magic circle and called in for some backup to take them for interrogation.</p><p><br></p><p>He then turned back towards the Devil. “Come in. Baraqiel is on his way too. These fools will be taken care of.”</p><p><br></p><p>They walked towards the house and greeted the lady of the house.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl on the other hand looked emotionally exhausted and had fallen asleep.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you have any ideas about who they could be?” he questioned.</p><p><br></p><p>She shook her head. “I only know that they were Baraquiel’s enemies. They didn’t say anything else for me to know but I suspect that they might have been sent by my family.”</p><p><br></p><p>The Himejima Clan?</p><p><br></p><p>Hmm… the way she had left the house was not exactly pleasant to say the least. But would they hire people to kill her?</p><p><br></p><p>“What do you think?” He heard Mephisto questioning the boy.</p><p><br></p><p>“Me?” The boy looked surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Go on. What do you think of the situation? The faster this is taken care of, the faster you can get your work done.”</p><p><br></p><p>“... they were not killers.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Excuse me?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I mean they were not trained killers. More like people who had a grudge. Trained killers would never have let a child escape so easily. Moreover, the stab wound would have been at a more vital place and they would have had some kind of suicide measures in case they got caught but they didn’t. I think if they are… questioned… a bit forcefully, they would break.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But how would they know when Baraqiel would be out? That kind of information is not easily available.”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy shrugged. “They might have been hired or informed by someone but I doubt that one of the five Principal Clans would hire such amateur assassins for something like this. It might have been for some other purpose.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. That does sound reasonable. They will be speaking everything in no time. But the matter of Shuri still remains.” He turned toward Mephisto, “So, what do you think?”</p><p><br></p><p>The old Devil shrugged. “She can discuss it with Baraqiel. It’s not like I ask anything from my peerage members.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you. In that case, Baraqiel can discuss it with you. I still have to take care of them.”</p><p><br></p><p>Soon, the backup he had called arrived and they took the people in for interrogation.</p><p><br></p><p>Baraqiel arrived soon after that and reunited with his scared family and after reassuring them, he sat down to discuss the future path.</p><p><br></p><p>“I could appoint guards to this place but you know how that will end up. The Principal Clans will be causing problems, not to mention our people will also question the decision to guard a devil. Pardon my bland words.” he turned towards Shuri and apologised.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry, I understand.”</p><p><br></p><p>Baraqiel sighed.</p><p><br></p><p>Mephisto spoke at this point. “If I may?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes?”</p><p><br></p><p>“You could always send her to the Grauzaberer Organisation. I mean she is technically my peerage member. She can stay there and be protected. And it’s not like you all don’t visit there anyway. It would be out of Japan and the Principal Clans have no influence there either. That’s only if you all have no problems with it.”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at Baraqiel and his wife. It was their choice after all.</p><p><br></p><p>Both of them had some talks and agreed to Mephisto’s proposal.</p><p><br></p><p>They would stay over at Grauzaberer until this matter was taken care of to avoid any danger to their daughter Akeno.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Ace -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The chaos was settled by the time it was night.</p><p><br></p><p>We wanted to leave and get the Purification done some other day but Shuri wanted to repay us by helping us out today itself.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright go on. Bring whatever you want out.” Mephisto asked me and I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>I pointed to an empty corner of the room to the lady of the house. “Can I use that place?”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded in agreement and I removed the trunk from my necklace and placed it there.</p><p><br></p><p>The people in the room looked at me with confusion as I waved my wand and the trunk expanded to the normal size.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t pay attention to them and opened the trunk door and entered it, soon returning back with a smaller trunk.</p><p><br></p><p>Lavy was looking at the trunks with bright eyes and so did Mephisto.</p><p><br></p><p>“What’s that?” he asked, pointing towards the trunk.</p><p><br></p><p>“I was trying my hand at Enchanting. It’s basically my lab. I carry it with me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A lab?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yup.” I ignored them and opened the smaller trunk.</p><p><br></p><p>Inside it was one of the Teigu I had gained from the Emperor yesterday.</p><p><br></p><p>“Where did you get such a thing? I don’t think I recognize it from anywhere.” Azazel asked, looking at the Jar of Demon’s Extract.</p><p><br></p><p>“I worked as a hunter in the pits.” I replied.</p><p><br></p><p>Mephisto looked at me oddly. “You’re fourteen.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm… and your point is?”</p><p><br></p><p>The man shut his mouth at the answer. Even Azazel and Baraqiel became quiet</p><p><br></p><p>I placed the jar in front of the woman as everyone narrowed their eyes at it.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is the blood of a strong Demonic Beast. It still has some leftover will of the beast. I want to have it purified to remove the will to use it in one of my experiments. Do you think it can be done without losing any of the properties?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alchemy?’ Mephisto asked and I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Transfiguration is related to Alchemy.” I explained.</p><p><br></p><p>I had already removed a glass of the Demon’s Extract aside.</p><p><br></p><p>The woman checked the jar a few times and then drew symbols around it to isolate the effects of the Demon’s Extract.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is very strong. In fact, I haven’t seen this kind of aura from anyone apart from the Vermilion Bird but this one feels a lot more raw, unfiltered and Demonic. Yes, I know how to remove the leftover will from this. In fact, many of the inks Onmyoji use for their talismans are made from the blood of powerful Youkai and they need to remove their leftover wills from them, but it will be hard. I will need to do some preparations and need to collect some materials too and most importantly, I will need several other Miko to help me with this. It would have been easy if I had the help of the Himejima Clan but…”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s… I see. In that case, can you teach me some purification techniques?’ I asked. “I have been very interested in such things.”</p><p><br></p><p>She smiled. “That I can do.”</p><p><br></p><p>“In that case, I look forward to learning from you, Shuri-san.” I bowed lightly. It was the best thing I can get for now. I will just have to find another way to purify this Teigu.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>Today was such an utter waste of time.</p><p><br></p><p>Well not exactly a waste as saving Shuri Himejima did get me a cookie point from the Fallen Angels, however small that might have been.</p><p><br></p><p>But overall, I got exposed to more people that I would have liked.</p><p><br></p><p>And I didn’t like that.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, the reason I had rejected Mephisto’s offer of recommendation was because I would have to sit for the examinations with my real identity in a year and a half and that would mean everyone would know who I am and more importantly where I am.</p><p><br></p><p>The contract between Mephisto and me didn’t end for two and half years, which was one year later.</p><p><br></p><p>During that one year, I would be easily targetable.</p><p><br></p><p>But if I participated in the Recommendation Games with my own identity, then I could always return here with my disguise and work for the remaining one year… unbothered.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t want people to notice me until I was strong enough to defend myself from them.</p><p><br></p><p>Sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>But as they say… the best laid plans of men and mice.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly, I sensed a summoning once more.</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly waved my hand and cleaned my room, ready to receive the summoning.</p><p><br></p><p>The hole opened and on the other end was a spiky brown haired green eyed boy. He looked like a Japanese guy around sixteen or seventeen and was wearing an outfit consisting of a gold-trimmed green mantle, white shirt, pants, and leather boots. He had a short sword on his belt.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t know why but it seemed oddly familiar for some reason but I couldn’t remember why.</p><p><br></p><p>“W-w-who are you?” He asked, pointing a finger at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hello. My name is Acelin Belphegor. May I know what your name is?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Satou Kazuma.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Seriously?” I asked in a deadpan.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oi why are you giving me that look, bastard?” he pointed his finger at me and jumped in his place.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are the guy who died because you were scared by a tractor.” I deadpanned, making him freeze. I observed him with Legilimency.</p><p><br></p><p>It was him.</p><p><br></p><p>“H-h-how do you know that?” He asked me to turn pale and then looked around himself to see if anyone heard what I said. “Dammit, did Aqua spread it all over Heaven?”</p><p><br></p><p>“There are many things I know. By the way, would you like to trade something? I have plenty of stuff you might be interested in.” I waved his worries off.</p><p><br></p><p>“W-what stuff?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Video Games, consoles, manga, hentai doujinshi…” As I said each word, the guy stilled for a moment and then jumped at the hole directly.</p><p><br></p><p>“I agree. Tell me what you want? I can even trade a goddess, an expert magician and a crusader.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I have no interest in the Loli Explosion Magician, the Masochistic Crusader and the Useless Goddess… but maybe you could give me something else.”</p><p><br></p><p>The guy’s mouth opened. “You really know things.”</p><p><br></p><p>I shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, what will it be?”</p><p><br></p><p>He quickly laid out everything he had in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>Coins, potions, adventurer card and a lot of random stuff.</p><p><br></p><p>The thing which caught my eye was a sword.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ohh, nice eye you have there Ace. This is the fabled Cursed Sword Gram. It can cut through anything.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Nintendo and one game.” I offered, stopping him from advertising.</p><p><br></p><p>“What! You are robbing me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s not like you or anyone else other than Mitsurugi can use it there. Even if I trade it, it’s more than likely to be useless.” I shrugged, making him blanche.</p><p><br></p><p>“Three games with a Nintendo and a Gameboy.” He quickly bargained.</p><p><br></p><p>“Three games with a Nintendo and a Gameboy and know what, I will even throw in a magical charger which can charge the consoles with Magic but you will have to make Aqua do something for me?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Aqua?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yup. I need her to cast a purification magic on something.”</p><p><br></p><p>“...just that much?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yup.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You are not tricking me, are you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you have anything to lose? If you want, I can give you half the payment upfront.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Really? Then deal.” he gave me a thumbs up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright.” I brought out a gameboy and two games from my trunk and threw it at him while taking Gram.</p><p><br></p><p>I always kept a stock of games and stuff to trade with the Kid Emperor but he’s in his serious mode right now so…</p><p><br></p><p>“I will get that useless Goddess in five minutes.” He said as he ran out.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh and if she tries to attack or purify me… I am not ever trading anything with you ever.” I warned him first.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t want to test the might of a Goddess’ purification on my body.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy gave me a thumbs up and ran away while I closed the portal.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the sword in my hand and passed my Demonic Power through it.</p><p><br></p><p>A smile appeared on my face.</p><p><br></p><p>It worked.</p><p><br></p><p>Devils could use such equipment innately in this world.</p><p><br></p><p>My guess is that Mitsurugi was blessed with the ability to wield the sword which no one in the world possessed, kinda like how some humans have a certain amount of Holy Sword factor.</p><p><br></p><p>But it didn’t matter to me.</p><p><br></p><p>I finally had a decent sword.</p><p><br></p><p>Before I could explore the sword anymore, I felt the summoning once more so I opened the portal again.</p><p><br></p><p>It was Kazuma again but this time beside him was a blue haired girl looking at everything in surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s complete the second part of the Deal.” Kazuma jumped before I could say anything.</p><p><br>“Kazuma, wait… he’s a demon.” Aqua pointed out towards me, making him stop… but not for long.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, did you get the charger and the rest of the games?”</p><p><br></p><p>I gave the guy a thumbs up and showed him the stuff. “But the purification first.” I replied, bringing out the Demon’s Extract and keeping it on the ground and moving a distance away from the jar.</p><p><br></p><p>“Aqua… if you want me to repay your debt, use purification on the jar.” The guy turned towards the Goddess in a cold tone.</p><p><br></p><p>“K-kazuma… you can’t be serious.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, you are living in the streets then. Bye. Good to know you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“W-wait. I will do it.” She turned towards the hole and used purification on the Jar.</p><p><br></p><p>I had to jump away from the place and immediately erect a wall between me and the jar to get hurt and even then I still felt all the hair on the back of my neck stand up from the power.</p><p><br></p><p>A roar erupted from the jar as a shadow of a demonic being escaped from the jar and was erased under the attack of the light.</p><p><br></p><p>Damn…</p><p><br></p><p>I was still looking at the jar in awe when I heard the voice.</p><p><br></p><p>“There, done.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>The Goddess was pouting and turned away from the Hole and the boy beside her looked at me.</p><p><br></p><p>I threw the rest of the stuff through the hole and he caught it.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nice doing business with you. By the way, if you don’t mind, I would like to trade more stuff from you later on if you want. For example some of the High End products from Wiz’s shop. I can pay for the stuff and extra games as your commission… but be warned.” I warned looking at the look on his face. “I can read minds so if you try to cheat me… I will curse you so that your dick shrivels up into a dry husk.” The scheming look on his face disappeared as his face became pale. He saluted.</p><p><br></p><p>“Got it. Sayonara.”</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t say anything either and hurriedly closed the hole.</p><p><br></p><p>And as soon as I did it, I heard several knocks on the door and it dawned on me.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone must have felt that purification magic.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Fuck!</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>It took me hours to explain to them that I had tried one of the purification rituals from a book and messed up with the ingredients and that resulted in the explosion of purification energy.</p><p><br></p><p>They obviously didn’t buy it but didn’t bother me.</p><p><br></p><p>It wasn’t unheard of for Magicians to do experiments and mess up often.</p><p><br></p><p>The catch was that I was called by Mephisto to his office.</p><p><br></p><p>“So… care to tell me what you did?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I was experimenting with a variation of the ritual circle from a book Shuri-san gave me and messed up in the quantities of the materials and design leading to the… mishap.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“That… mishap… could have seriously wounded or downright killed an Ultimate Class Devil.” he deadpanned.</p><p><br></p><p>“... I am sorry. I will keep it in mind.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sigh… you just need to wait a bit and I will arrange for the Purification of that blood. He offered. This way you are just risking yourself.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I… am sorry. But I don’t have much time. I needed to get it done soon. Also, the purification is complete. You don’t have to look for anyone.”</p><p><br></p><p>This surprised him.</p><p><br></p><p>“You did it?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Kinda… yes. On the other hand, can you arrange a place for me to do one last experiment. It would be for the best if it has nothing in the surroundings for a few ten kilometres.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Were you not listening to me? Why are you risking yourself so much? Just what is it that you want to chase so desperately that you would push yourself to this extent?”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>I recalled everything I had done and faced since I could remember in this world.</p><p><br></p><p>Why did I do everything?</p><p><br></p><p>Why was I even doing anything at all?</p><p><br></p><p>My current level of power and position was enough for me to live the rest of my extremely long life in luxury.</p><p><br></p><p>So why?</p><p><br></p><p>And I remembered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Because I do not wish to be mediocre. I refuse to be weak. I refuse to be ignored, tossed aside by anyone at their will. I don’t want to be at anyone’s mercy. But I was not born with everything… so I will work hard, I will break every bone in my body and rebuild it again if that’s what it takes to get to that level.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man looked at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Who are you?” he asked.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked back at him. “Arrange a place for me. I will tell you my identity.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Done. Let’s go now.”</p><p><br></p><p>He got up and took me by hand, directly teleporting away from the place.</p><p><br></p><p>The next time I could see around was the Underworld.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is my territory. You can do whatever you want here. No one will disturb you. Now, tell me, who are you?”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked around and indeed the whole place was empty desert wherever the eye could see.</p><p><br></p><p>Very well then.</p><p><br></p><p>I turned back to face the devil and let my disguise fall.</p><p><br></p><p>“My name is Acelin Abaddon, the outcast son of Bedeze Abbadon and Melisha Belphagor.”</p><p><br></p><p>I replied and turned back leaving the stunned devil as I walked into a distance and brought out the Demon’s Extract from my trunk.</p><p><br></p><p>I poured a single cup aside for future experiments.</p><p><br></p><p>It was said that even a single cup was enough but according to what I remembered from Esdeath’s words back in the manga… it gave more power the more one could drink and resist its power.</p><p><br></p><p>And since that was the case, I lifted the entire jar and placed my lips on the corner and began drinking.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Mephisto -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the boy from a distance, still recovering from the shock of his identity.</p><p><br></p><p>Acelin Abaddon.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, wasn’t that name a famous one… and not in the right kind of way.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Everything made sense now.</p><p><br></p><p>Why he was so cautious.</p><p><br></p><p>Why he never trusted anyone.</p><p><br></p><p>Why a fourteen year old would be experienced at hunting in the Pits.</p><p><br></p><p>Why a kid so young would have such an outlook on life.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, those two fools, they couldn’t even recognise such a gem.</p><p><br></p><p>At this moment, he saw the boy bringing out the jar… and drink it.</p><p><br></p><p>In the very next moment, he fell to his knees and let out a loud cry of anguish.</p><p><br></p><p>Mephisto was about to ask what was wrong with him but before he could say anything to the boy, he felt a surge in Demonic Power coming from the boy and quickly erected a barrier.</p><p><br></p><p>A wave of power passed over him in all directions and wherever it went, it left behind a world of white.</p><p><br></p><p>This power… it was approaching the levels of an Ultimate Class being.<br><br></p><p>Just… what in the world was this?</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Well, a few things happened in this chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ace’s boosted luck dragged him into another messy situation.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>He got a contract with the Advocate of True Gender Equality and made a cool trade.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>We will hopefully see more of him later on.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The Empire is being cleaned.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>And finally, Ace is now a bit strong.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I will be having him open up some more portals to different worlds in the next chapter as he establishes a strong base and prepares for the Recommendation Games.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The Underworld would not know what hits them.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br><br></p>",

The intended transformation (t) is directly influenced by body weight (a), viciousness (v), wand power (w), concentration (c) and a fifth unknown variable (Z), as described by the following mathematical formula.” I wrote the formula on the board and looked back at the crowd who had gathered to take my class.</p><p><br></p><p>It had been two months since I had started to teach at Grauzaberer and Transfiguration was surprisingly famous.</p><p><br></p><p>I had over a hundred students for my first official class itself.</p><p><br></p><p>They were mostly Middle Class Magicians and up as they wanted to see the new magic and research it by themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>Later on, even new students began joining and I was teaching three whole classes till the High Class level.</p><p><br></p><p>The only reason I was even keeping up with this was because of the daily teachings of Dumbledore. The man was keeping his word. I was not someone who went back on my words either.</p><p><br></p><p>I had removed Voldemort’s soul from Harry’s scar.</p><p><br></p><p>In the last two months, I had completed the seven years curriculum of the Transfiguration subject taught at Hogwarts and I could get a passable grade but this was not enough for Dumbledore as he was helping me refine the skills more so that I can continue towards more advanced topics later on.</p><p><br></p><p>But either way, the seven year syllabus was enough for me to teach these for the next three years or so easily.</p><p><br></p><p>I will be starting on the higher level transfiguration after this and when that is mastered, I will move towards Alchemy studies.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, that’s all for the theory part today. We are going to learn something quite simple today. Each of you has a set of random objects in front of you. We are going to turn all these objects into rabbits. The Spell is ‘Lapifors’. You pronounce it as ‘LAP-i-fors’. The wand movements are simple, just point your wand at the object. Have a solid image for the object you are transforming it into. Do not hesitate. As I repeat in every class, hesitating even a bit is a crime in this class. I will first give you all an example and then you can try.” I whipped my wand at a pen, a diary and a cup on my table and all three of them turned into rabbits. “Go on. And I want an essay on the differences you all noticed when using the spell on different materials so pay attention.”</p><p><br></p><p>With that done, I stood back and observed the class.</p><p><br></p><p>For the last few months I had devoted all my time to this magic and I was reaching somewhere but it wasn’t anywhere at the level where I can use it as a combat magic.</p><p><br></p><p>But it didn’t mean that I was doing nothing to make up for that side of me.</p><p><br></p><p>I was copying one book everyday from the library of Grauzaberer which I could access. Thankfully, my class was getting famous and I was getting better books. I still made enough copies for me to study even when I wasn’t a part of the organisation or teach someone whom I take as a subordinate </p><p><br></p><p>But it wasn’t like I was only taking things from here. I was even making books on transfiguration from the Hogwarts books I had in my possession.</p><p><br></p><p>They will be sold and I was going to get royalty for the books.</p><p><br></p><p>It would add to my resume when I apply for the position of a High Class Magician and even Ultimate Class Magician later.</p><p><br></p><p>According to Mephisto, as long as I worked at this pace for the next three years and met the required level of strength, I would easily get an Ultimate Class certification due to having created a completely new branch of magic by myself… at least for this world.</p><p><br></p><p>But that’s where the clause laid.</p><p><br></p><p>Meet the required level of strength.</p><p><br></p><p>Basically have the strength to cast a spell which can affect an entire city.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s the basic criteria for being an Ultimate Class.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, the Ultimate Class was an extremely confusing level of power.</p><p><br></p><p>Anyone from a decently strong Devil to even most of the Gods, were all Ultimate Class beings. It was a very broad range so being one was relatively easy but being one at the top of it was just just that hard.</p><p><br></p><p>The Leader Class or as in case of Devils, the Satan Class was above that and they could take on several Ultimate Class beings. Reaching this level needed a chance like some artifacts or innate powers. Training and reaching this level was almost unheard of.</p><p><br></p><p>And then there were the Transcendental Class beings or as the Devils influenced by the modern lingo call it… Super Devil level beings.</p><p><br></p><p>These were the ones who had far surpassed the level of a normal Leader Class, beings like the current Lucifer and Beelzebub as well as the Heavenly Dragons and strong Gods.</p><p><br></p><p>And yes… it was impossible for anyone to reach this level without being born with the potential or having a Super Cheat like a Longinus and even that didn’t guarantee anything. It was really a level where you can become a voice in the world which people cannot ignore anymore… well except those at the very top.</p><p><br></p><p>And finally, the ones who could ignore even Transcendental Beings… well, there were only a couple such beings who were just the strongest Gods.</p><p><br></p><p>There was also something about this world… hard work can only carry you so much without some unique advantage of your own like a super strong Sacred Gear or something.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean look at Sairaorg.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy worked his bones off to train and get to a decent level of strength, even got a Longinus and even then was defeated by an idiot shouting boobs with just a month or two of training.</p><p><br></p><p>He was not the only one.</p><p><br></p><p>Vali was the same.</p><p><br></p><p>That guy was fighting since he was just a preteen and reached a level where he could take down Ultimate Class beings easily and he still lost.</p><p><br></p><p>There were other such beings too.</p><p><br></p><p>I remember a Low Class Devil who had trained for hundreds of years and was still just an Ultimate Class Devil. The Light Novels only showed a funny side albeit a bit annoying side of the story but what they always ignored was the struggle and pain of the people to reach that level of power and still losing in front of the gifted ones.</p><p><br></p><p>The reality of this world was cruel.</p><p><br></p><p>Training didn’t always make you the strongest. Some limits were just impossible to break with simple training alone.</p><p><br></p><p>It was not a world of a shounen novel where everything was sunshine and daisies.</p><p><br></p><p>It was depressing</p><p><br></p><p>It was heartbreaking.</p><p><br></p><p>But it was the truth of this world.</p><p><br></p><p>But I will break this chain. </p><p><br></p><p>I will not be weak anymore.</p><p><br></p><p>I will become the <a href=\"https://strongest….no\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">strongest….no</a><em> matter what</em>.</p><p><br></p><p>An explosion of flesh and gore interrupted my thoughts.</p><p><br></p><p>Some guy had blasted a rabbit while trying to transfigure the second object.</p><p><br></p><p>I flicked my wand to clean the whole place and transfigured the remains into a goblet again.</p><p><br></p><p>“Your frustration translates into your spells. Keep your emotions in check.” I walked a few steps forward and then added. “You will hand out the basic rules of casting five hundred times before your next class, if you mess it up again.”</p><p><br></p><p>A few things had happened in the last month apart from my progress in Transfiguration Magic and that was my friendship with the kid Emperor.</p><p><br></p><p>The Prime Minister was turning things for the worse and if this continued, things wouId become irreparable soon so I had to use some high handed means. I had used some charm magic to plant some suggestions into him.</p><p><br></p><p>From what I had heard, the Empire had gotten a new star in the military.</p><p><br></p><p>She had blue hair and blue eyes and was from the Northern Clans and her name was… Esdeath Patras.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>It was her.</p><p><br></p><p>What I found out about her was that even without getting her Teigu, she was an extremely strong soldier who could fight high level Danger Beasts by herself.</p><p><br></p><p>The crazy lady was here and she was rising fast in the ranks of the Empire’s Military. Actually, she wasn’t exactly a crazy lady right now as she didn’t receive the Demon’s Extract Teigu yet. Having demonic whispers in your ears would do a number on any person’s sanity.</p><p><br></p><p>But this also told me something else. Time was running out and I had to make a move fast.</p><p><br></p><p>My plan was made and now all that was left was for the young Emperor to get ready.</p><p><br></p><p>If things went well, I would be able to carry this plan out within the next six months.</p><p><br></p><p>“Any questions?” I asked, as the class ended.</p><p><br></p><p>Several hands rose up.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Why do these bastards always have questions?</p><p><br></p><p>I let out a sigh. “Alright, line up one by one.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Mephisto Pheles -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the screen as Ace was clearing out the doubts of the students one by one even with the annoyed look on his face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Quite dedicated, that boy.” His queen said, looking at the screen.</p><p><br></p><p>“He’s what people in Japan call a tsundere. He might get annoyed at them or even outright murderous but he will still do his duty as long as they don’t cross the line. Although, he doesn’t have much patience for slackers. He has kicked several people from his classes or demoted them to a lower class because he deemed them not up to his mark.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Geniuses are quirky.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh that they are but there were other reasons for those too. His magic is extremely dangerous if people are careless with it. All the people he had demoted or thrown out had tried to learn the magic by themselves and had to be admitted to the health care services. They even made the mistakes at the precise point he had cited as a reason for demoting them.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s… quite some talent. He must be a very good teacher then.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well obviously. Do you know how many requests I have got in these past months from other organisations for exchanging research or even attending classes? Even those Golden Dawn bastards with a ten foot pole up their ass requested joint classes.” He laughed heartily.</p><p><br></p><p>He might have taken the leadership of Grauzaberer to kill his boredom but that didn’t mean he didn’t like winning.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well good that you are having fun but… now onto the main question, just who is this boy? I assume that you have already noticed his disguise.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously. I noticed it the first day itself. But his contract didn't require him to reveal his identity so I didn’t bother either.” He shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is he?”</p><p><br></p><p>“He’s only fourteen so I doubt he is a big criminal. He doesn’t seem the sort from what I have observed of him.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then what about the ruckus in the Underworld?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, about that? My guess is that he is someone with a troublesome background and is keeping his identity to avoid trouble. He didn’t exactly attack anyone and only ran away. But none of that exactly matters to me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, as long as you think it’s fine. By the way, what is the boy doing?” Tannin pointed towards the screen.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, he is making contracts. He always does that. Anyone who wants to clear their doubts after their class hours has to make contracts with him. In fact, he conducts five such classes with over a thousand students with contracts.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Isn’t that a violation of his contract?” Tannin asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nope. He is completing his classes without slacking. If someone wants to make him work more than he is being paid for, they pay for it on their own. I think it’s quite fair. I think that in the next three years, he will have a decent number of contracts to his name.”</p><p><br></p><p>“...I see. So, why did you call me here today?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah yes. It was about Ace too. Talents like him attract the awe and envy of others too easily. There have been four attempts to kidnap him in the last two months and I have dealt with them. But it seems people are really underestimating me.” He brought out a file from his drawer. “Here’s the list of organisations who were involved in the attempts. I want you to go there and <em>deliver a message</em>. Ace is under my protection. Make sure they understand and remember this fact.” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. I will bring some boys with me.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Acelin - </strong></p><p><br></p><p>I was finally alone after the day’s busy schedule.</p><p><br></p><p>Today’s extra class had netted me three hundred deals with the magicians of Grauzaberer, a bit of power as well as a decent amount of money.</p><p><br></p><p>It turns out that the Human world and the Supernatural worlds were far closer than most of us realise.</p><p><br></p><p>Many of the top businesses in this world have contracts with Supernatural factions to avoid being taken advantage by others.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean just imagine someone contracting a devil to steal the idea of their rival company or even just mind control them and take over their businesses completely.</p><p><br></p><p>The rivals would be left completely defenceless if they didn’t have a contract in the Supernatural side of the spectrum.</p><p><br></p><p>Generally they had contracts or relations with Magicians and the truly rich ones even raised their own magicians to protect their businesses.</p><p><br></p><p>As such most of the High Class Magicians and even the Middle Class Magicians were always funded by such people and didn’t lack money per say.</p><p><br></p><p>Good for me.</p><p><br></p><p>I lay on my bed after the daily class with Dumbledore. The things I had ordered for the Emperor would arrive tomorrow so no trading with him today.</p><p><br></p><p>At this moment, I sensed another summoning.</p><p><br></p><p>Quickly arranging everything in place, I summoned the hole to connect to the Summoning Contract.</p><p><br></p><p>An unfamiliar figure appeared on the other side of the portal.</p><p><br></p><p>The man had a black beard and hair and had dark circles under his eyes. He looked at me in awe.</p><p><br></p><p>“Who are you and what is it that you desire?” I asked, putting on the show which I had perfected in these past months.</p><p><br></p><p>“I…my name is Sirius Orion Black and I…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sirius Black. I see. So you are out of Azkaban. Congratulations on your freedom.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you. I know you are a ….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Devil. Yes. Why is it so hard for you people to digest? I mean I highly doubt any of you are highly religious after the Witch Hunts so why do you all still hesitate this much?”</p><p><br></p><p>I saw him wince a bit but shook it off and continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“I thank you for saving Harry’s life. It doesn’t matter to me what you are. You have done something which I was supposed to do and protect his life. For that I will be eternally grateful to you.” he bowed deeply.</p><p><br></p><p>“It was a deal. I didn’t do him any favour.” I waved it off. “So, why did you summon me? I don’t think you summoned me here to just thank me?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I…” He hesitated a bit before steeling himself and continuing. “I wish to make a deal with you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh? Speak up.”</p><p><br></p><p>He gritted his teeth as rage took over his face. “I wish to know where Voldemort is.” He almost growled.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Going for revenge, are we? Let me take a guess. You wanted to go out but Dumbleore said to leave it all to him but you don’t want to stay sitting while the murderer of your friend roamed around. Did I get it all right?”</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t answer but his looks made it obvious that I hit the nail on its head.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you know where he is?” he asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, I do.”</p><p><br></p><p>“State your price. I will give you anything.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Anything? Hahahaha you don’t have any idea what you are offering.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I know. Even if it’s my life, my soul, I will offer it all as long as I can kill that monster.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Soul? No way. That’s a very bad currency. No two souls are equal and thus they don’t make for a good currency. Do you think your soul would be equal to Voldemort’s or Dumbledore’s? But I am not that cruel. How about we trade for something you wouldn’t mind giving away?”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at me expectantly to continue.</p><p><br></p><p>“I want all the books on magic belonging to the Black Family.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Deal.” He answered almost instantly, surprising me for a second.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t look surprised. If I can get the location of that bastard and destroy the dark legacy of my cursed family, it’s a win for me on both sides.”</p><p><br></p><p>“See, I am a good guy, right? Alright, Voldemort is currently in the forests of Romania in a soul form. He is jumping from one body to another, possessing small animals or weak people to live. That said, as long as all his anchors have been destroyed, the moment he tries to make his next jump, he would die so I would rather go after the anchors rather than him if Dumbledore hasn’t done it already.”</p><p><br></p><p>He stood open-mouthed at the reveal. “So…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah… the information is kinda useless. Although, I have plenty of other information which you would <em>love</em> to know. How about it?” I quickly added. There were still a lot of things to be gained from him.</p><p><br></p><p>The Blacks were extremely rich and I wouldn’t let it go so easily.</p><p><br></p><p>“What information?” He asked, cautiously.</p><p><br></p><p>I guess getting cheated once showed him the reality.</p><p><br></p><p>“Now we are talking? So what do you want to know? How to get power, money, ways for werewolves to control their curse, or… the reason why Voldemort even went after the Potters and Longbottoms?”</p><p><br></p><p>He stilled at the last two mentions “Ways to control or remove the werewolf curse? Can you remove the curse? And what do you mean by the reasons? They were hunting all light based families. The Potters and the Longbottoms had caused a lot of trouble for them. That’s why they went after him.” he said, quickly taking the bait.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, there are ways to cure lycanthropy but I can’t get my hands on one right now. You will have to wait for a while for that. But… I can give you the method of reigning a Werewolf’s curse in, if you offer me the correct price.”</p><p><br></p><p>Lycanthropy was present in this world as well and people had developed ways to remove the curse but it required at least an Ultimate Class level to even attempt something like that.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, controlling their wild self could be done.</p><p><br></p><p>There were even books on that at Grauzaberer.</p><p><br></p><p>“What about the one who betrayed James? It was Peter. That bastard already got caught.” he growled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Peter Pettigrew only took him to the Potter’s abode. But why exactly was he hunting them? It wasn’t because of their resistance or there wouldn’t have been a need to target them, specifically the children, so… why exactly did he go after the kids?”</p><p><br></p><p>His eyes widened as he sensed something wrong.</p><p><br>Seriously?</p><p><br></p><p>You had over ten years in prison.</p><p><br></p><p>Did you not think about anything?</p><p><br></p><p>The power of plot is strong in this one.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why?” He asked, quite agitated.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nah, you are forgetting the basics of making a deal. First we discuss the terms of the deal and only then you get the information.”</p><p><br></p><p>He was getting impatient and hurriedly asked. “What do you want?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I want a trunk similar to the one Newt Scamander had where he keeps his entire collection of Magical Beasts.” With the money from the Black Family, it wouldn’t be a surprise if he could get it for me.</p><p><br></p><p>He agreed readily. “Now answer me, who?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It happened when Albus Dumbledore was conducting a recruitment for professors, more specifically the recruitment for a Divination professor. Sybill Trelawney was undergoing her interview when…she made a prophecy. An actual prophecy.”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at me silently and I continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“Her exact words were…<em>The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches... born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies... and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not... and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives... the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies...</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>The expressions on his face changed several times and he finally spoke. “You can’t be serious.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh but I am. That fool was so afraid of dying that he created a self fulfilling prophecy. Only two people met the criteria. Harry Potter and Nevile Longbottom.”</p><p><br></p><p>Then a look of realisation came on his face. “Wait. You said that Dumbledore was conducting the interview then…how did Voldemort find out?”</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled. “Oho, are you asking me another question?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Aghhh just tell me what you want for it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Superb. I want books on Potions, Arithmancy and Enchantment till the Master’s level. At least five hundred each with no repetitions.”</p><p><br></p><p>His face paled. “But that much would be…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hard to get but not impossible. There are more than one magical communities in the world. You have time. I don’t think it’s a big deal.”</p><p><br></p><p>He took a deep breath. “Alright. I agree.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Great. But before I tell you the answer I want to remind you of something.”</p><p><br></p><p>He narrowed his eyes but I paid no attention.</p><p><br></p><p>“Harry Potter hasn’t had a good life. No. he’d had a very terrible life till before Hogwarts. You can simply assess it by the fact that his first Hogwarts letter had the address of ‘Cupboard under the Stairs’ and his nickname was Freak.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man’s face morphed into a look of shock which was replaced by a look of intense rage. “I will kill the…”</p><p><br></p><p>“You will do nothing as you have already done enough. If you hadn’t chased after Pettigrew that day due to your own selfish rage and explained the situation properly to others, Harry wouldn’t have had to live with those people. It was just as much your fault as it is theirs.” I chided. “I <em>absolutely detest</em> people who abandon children. So, when I tell you the identity of the one who disclosed the information to Voldemort, do remember that currently you are Harry’s only family, the only one he has known in his whole life. Don’t ruin it for the kid again due to your own anger issues.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man looked like a kicked puppy at the words. He fell to his knees, covered his face with his hands and weeped.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, the prison had done a number on his head.</p><p><br></p><p>The only reason I reminded him was because otherwise he would have rushed to kill Snape and I wouldn’t have gotten my payment then. I was not doing this for the kid.</p><p><br></p><p>If he benefited from this then it was just a lucky coincidence.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Just a lucky coincidence I repeated to myself.</p><p><br></p><p>He finished crying a bit later and nodded at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“There was someone who was spying on the interview and listened in on half of the prophecy… Serverus Snape.”</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>Sirius Black made a final deal with me after finding out about Snape’s identity and that was for the way to control the Werewolf curse.</p><p><br></p><p>The price was five hundred thousand galleons, several things to make potions</p><p> and two Invisibility Cloaks.</p><p><br></p><p>To his credit, he didn’t even blink an eye as he agreed to the demand.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe I should have asked for more.</p><p><br></p><p>I shook my head. This was enough for now.</p><p><br></p><p>There was still the removal for the curse not to mention several other things on which I could swindle them.</p><p><br></p><p>No need to get hasty and ruin things.</p><p><br></p><p>I lay on my bed, tired beyond words. Today, I had really pushed the limits of my Demonic Power.</p><p><br></p><p>In these last few months, my Demonic Power had risen sharply due to the regular training and I now possessed a High Class level of power. It was nowhere near enough but was still very good for my age.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, I would need even more.</p><p><br></p><p>With the gold and the money, I can start some kind of business. Maybe a Potions or Enchanting Business to support myself.</p><p><br></p><p>Just as I was thinking of these, I heard a knock on the door.</p><p><br></p><p>Looking at the time which was around midnight, I checked the security cameras and saw a familiar face there.</p><p><br></p><p>I opened the door to see Lavinia standing outside with a box in her hands.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ace. Hurry, move away.” She pushed me aside and went to a table as she kept the box slowly there.</p><p><br></p><p>She opened it and I saw that it contained a cake.</p><p><br></p><p>A birthday cake.</p><p><br></p><p>She turned towards me. “Today is my birthday.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>I was taken aback at the reveal and then smiled at her as I caressed her hair softly. “Happy Birthday, Lavy.”</p><p><br></p><p>Her face lit up brightly at my words.</p><p><br></p><p>We lit the candles and she made a wish before blowing the candles and cutting the cake.</p><p><br></p><p>I sang for her. “What did you wish for?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm? I wished that we will always remain together.” She smiled brightly.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>I was stunned at her honest words.</p><p><br></p><p>There wasn’t a hint of lie or any deceit in her words.</p><p><br></p><p>“You want to stay together with me?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm.” She nodded. “You are my best friend, right? I obviously want to stay together with you always.”</p><p><br></p><p>I let out a chuckle. “Well it’s your birthday so…I will have to give you a gift too. But first, I want to tell you something.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes?”</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly shut the door and threw a small barrier to isolate ourselves.</p><p><br></p><p>“My name is not Ace?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm? Did you change your name?” She tilted her head lightly.</p><p><br></p><p>“…No. What I meant to say is that my real name is not Ace or rather my full name is not Ace. My actual name is… Acelin Abaddon.” I used the Gaea Foundation to revert to my original look. “And this is how I actually look.”</p><p><br></p><p>Her eyes widened and then she jumped on me. “So cute! Your pink hair looks so cute.” She shouted excitedly, making my eyes twitch.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s strawberry blonde not pink.” I complained but she was not listening.</p><p><br></p><p>“And you can change how you look? That’s awesome.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you not bothered by this at all? I mean I hid how I looked from you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“But it’s still you. Also, you kept this for my birthday so it’s actually special.”</p><p><br></p><p>…that’s not how it works.</p><p><br></p><p>I let out a sigh. It was useless trying to understand what went through her mind.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, in that case, let me show you your gift.” I brought out an Invisibility Cloak from my trunk. “Happy Birthday.” I wished her as I wrapped it around her.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked in amazement as her body vanished under the cover of the cloak.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is called an Invisibility Cloak.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you!” She hugged me and I returned her embrace.</p><p><br></p><p>After all, she was the first friend I had in this world.</p><p><br></p><p>Dave was more like a guardian.</p><p><br></p><p>Damn… I  miss him now.</p><p><br></p><p>But today was Lavy’s fourteenth birthday so I decided to give her all my attention for today.</p><p><br></p><p>We cut the cake and I explained to her that she can’t reveal my secret to anyone.</p><p><br></p><p>Later on, she slept in my room from exhaustion. I was exhausted too so I took a nap as well.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>Two days later, I summoned the hole for the class with Dumbledore.</p><p><br></p><p>The man had a serious and disappointed expression on his face.</p><p><br></p><p>“What’s up? Why so glum?” I asked, opening the conversation.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you tell Sirius about Serverus’ folly?”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>I narrowed my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. He offered me a deal. I accepted.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you understan…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Albus Dumbledore,” I  stopped the man before he could lecture me. “Don’t forget who I am.”</p><p><br></p><p>That shut him up.</p><p><br></p><p>“As for whatever argument you were cooking up, it’s useless against me. If something happens to Serverus Snape then he would deserve every bit of it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“He is repenting.” Dumbledore countered back.</p><p><br></p><p>“And what has he done in repentance? Bully children? Act as your spy? What bullshit! Who in the nine hells are you to forgive him? If there’s someone whose forgiveness he needs, that’s Harry Potter and Nevile and Augusta Longbottom. Go on. Tell them what he had done and see if they can forgive him. And no, many people dying in the war doesn’t make it alright for terrorists to be forgiven.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You are not the owner of this world. You have no right to decide who is forgiven and who is not. But even if you did… How is any of that my problem? We decided on a deal. I already completed my side of the deal and now you are completing your side. You do not dictate to me what and with whom I can make deals with.” I finished. “But just some friendly advice, don’t be so quick to forgive. I know of futures where Lucius Malfoy made a way to go back in time and revert history itself.” I saw his face pale.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s impossible!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Today maybe but what about the future? It was actually one of the students currently in your school who made the Time Turner go back that far in time.”</p><p><br></p><p>His mouth hung open at the reveal.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Albus there is nothing wrong with wanting to give people second chances, but those people must first realise what they did was bad and be willing to change. Otherwise you're just telling them they can do all the nasty shit they want with no consequences.\"<br><br>“But that’s enough talk for today. We still have a class to finish.”</p><p><br></p><p>Safe to say that the rest of the class was quiet.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>Three months had passed since my argument with Dumbledore.</p><p><br></p><p>He had kept more to himself since then, only teaching me without any other words.</p><p><br></p><p>But I wasn't bothered with this.</p><p><br></p><p>My transfiguration lessons with him were progressing at the usual pace.</p><p><br></p><p>I was almost at the master level now. I could now teach at any academy.</p><p><br></p><p>We expected it to be completed in two more months and then I will start with Alchemy.</p><p>It was something I was waiting for.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirius did however summon me twice.</p><p><br></p><p>Both times for the repayment of his side of the deal.</p><p><br></p><p>I found out from him that he and the Longbottoms had filed a case against Serverus Snape with proof. Investigations were ongoing and soon enough, there was a great chance that Serverus Snape would be in Azkaban.</p><p><br></p><p>Not to say there was no resistance.</p><p><br></p><p>Lucius Malfoy and the dark side were doing their best to protect him but Sirius being the Head of the House of Black almost neutered the Malfoy family.</p><p><br></p><p>Add to the fact that Cornelius Fudge didn’t dare speak anything bad against Sirius right now after the fuckup of his sentencing.</p><p><br></p><p>He even made another deal with me to find out about some dirt about those families and pressure the government.</p><p><br></p><p>I told him about Bartemius Couch Jr. and the guy made good work with it.</p><p><br></p><p>The payment for this was another five hundred thousand galleons.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirius wasn’t lying when he said that he was happy to sell off all his family’s properties.</p><p><br></p><p>The man gladly gave me two hundred and fifty thousand galleons on top of this when I told him the reality about his brother. He cried and thanked me.</p><p><br></p><p>One thing which happened was that his relationship with Dumbledore had deteriorated a lot. So did Remus’.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy had had Harry check up on the Prophecy and found out that it was completed.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Voldemort was dead.</p><p><br></p><p>My guess was right.</p><p><br></p><p>As soon as the last Horcrux, the cup of Helga Hufflepuff was destroyed, he passed away since he hadn’t made Nagini yet.</p><p><br></p><p>Since that was the case, they no longer had to cooperate with Dumbledore unwittingly.</p><p><br></p><p>The information about Snape really did a number on their relationship.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirius was about to remove Harry from the school but had only stopped because he didn’t want to remove him from the company of his friends.</p><p><br></p><p>His relationship with me became much better on the other hand.</p><p><br></p><p>Man… now I was feeling bad for taking his money like that.</p><p><br></p><p>Hmm.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe, I will tell him to invest somewhere and earn money.</p><p><br></p><p>With future knowledge, it would be easy to earn his money back.</p><p><br></p><p>He was currently convincing Remus to accept the book which I had given and would allow him to control his wolf side.</p><p><br></p><p>I however was not concerned about those. I finally had my secret base.</p><p><br></p><p>The Black Family was indeed one of the richest wizard families.</p><p><br></p><p>My new trunk was insanely big.</p><p><br></p><p>It was bigger than a football field.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirius had personally visited Newt Scammander and enquired about his suitcase and had one made as per the best model.</p><p><br></p><p>With this, I could carry out my activities without any fear.</p><p><br></p><p>As usual, I was summoned and this time it was the Emperor.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good evening, your Majesty. You look awfully serious today. What’s the matter?”</p><p><br></p><p>The kid looked like he would cry but held it back. “We… found out who killed our parents.”</p><p><br></p><p>“… I see.”</p><p><br></p><p>Tears fell from his eyes as he choked a little but stopped himself from breaking down.</p><p><br></p><p>“It was the Prime Minister Honest, wasn’t it?” I asked and he nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“General Budo… investigated and confirmed. We had him recruit the man called Gozuki and his squad of assassins. We even contacted the soldiers you told us about and recruited them, ordering everyone to investigate the incident… and they all came up with the same answer.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you decide what to do with them?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked back at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“What should we do?” He asked me, almost pleadingly.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>I looked back at him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Your Majesty.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You shouldn’t trust people so easily regarding these kinds of decisions. Do remember that the Prime Minister Honest wanted to take advantage of this as well? This kind of thing, you should consult someone whom you truly trust.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Why can’t you advise us? If it’s the price, we can pay you?”</p><p><br></p><p>I sighed at the kid’s reply. But then again, he was only around eight years old right now. It was too much to expect much from him to take these kinds of decisions. Actually, it was quite commendable that he asked me for advice and didn’t go charging to punish Honest and get killed then.</p><p><br></p><p>“I’m not related to your Empire. I am just someone who makes deals. It wouldn’t be right of me to interfere in the matters of your Empire.”</p><p><br></p><p>The kid became quiet and looked down in thought.</p><p><br></p><p>He then looked at me, a determined expression on his face. “We wish to make a deal.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“We said we wish to make a deal. You just said that you are someone who only makes deals, right? Then we wish to make a deal with you.” he said firmly.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at him for a moment before nodding. “Very well. What is it that you desire?”</p><p><br></p><p>He took a deep breath. “We wish to invite you to become the guardian of the Empire. State your price.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the kid in surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>And then a smile formed on my lips.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t know why but I kinda felt proud of this kid after teaching him for so long, he was finally acting smart.</p><p><br></p><p>This also reminded me of the contract Mephisto had made with Faust.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure you want to do that? If I become the guardian of the Empire, I will eliminate the threats to it. Which means if you yourself were to become a threat to the Empire, I will eliminate you as well.” I stated, testing his will.</p><p><br></p><p>“We agree. In fact we hope for that. If someday we or any of our descendants are fooled by someone like Honest again… it’s better for us to die than harm the Empire.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the kid, open mouthed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Very well then. I will negotiate with you seriously but I hope you understand that such a deal will involve me being bound to the Empire for a long time and as such, the price for the deal will be high too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We understand.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Great. I am still not strong enough to come and go into your world at will and will need a few more years at minimum to get to that level but I will provide the Empire with the knowledge to grow. When I can go there, I will even protect the Empire from threats. I will even give you advice but whether you follow it or not depends on you. I will not interfere.”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“In return, the Empire must also fulfil my requests. I won’t ask for anything which would endanger the Empire. To carry out my work, I will need a team of few people who will answer only to me. Emperor’s of the Empire can question them but will not order them to do anything against my will. You will just provide them a place, a territory to get an income from. I give you my word that none of them will interfere in the workings of the Empire and only act when the Empire is in danger.”</p><p><br></p><p>“This much is doable.” He agreed quite readily.</p><p><br></p><p>“Since that’s the case, my payment will be… four Teigus of my choice.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Four!”</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t think you understand something. I am not a human. I am from a race called Devils. We live for tens of thousands of years. You want me to be the Guardian of your Empire for such a long time and as such I am asking for a very small price.”</p><p><br></p><p>“T-t-ten thousand years!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Average. We can live longer as well.” I shrugged. To show that I was not joking, I summoned my wings and flew lightly in the air.</p><p><br></p><p>It was time for him to be surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next hour, we hammered down the details of the contract.</p><p><br></p><p>I did take some liberties because the kid was still that… a kid but I didn’t rob him blind. The advantages were that in case some dumb future descendant of his went around conquering the world and became a tyrant, I would be able to put a stop to them earlier.</p><p><br></p><p>One such clause was that the soul of any of the empire's traitors would belong to me. The same will be the case with any terrorists. They will obviously be assessed first under the Veritaserum and hypnosis but if proven guilty, their souls will be my property.</p><p><br></p><p>This kinda felt as if I was a dementor but who cared.</p><p><br></p><p>Right now, the capital is full of traitors. I am going to have a great increase in power.</p><p><br></p><p>With this, I was ready for the next step to establish a foothold in the Empire.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Najenda -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t know what was happening when many of the generals of the Empire had been called back so suddenly.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked beside her. There were some faces she recognised but some unknown ones as well.</p><p><br></p><p>The most prominent ones were General Budo, the strongest General of the Empire.</p><p><br></p><p>There were also General Liver and the infamous Hundred Man Slayer, Bulat.</p><p><br></p><p>Her thoughts were interrupted as the Emperor entered. She looked at the kid who took the throne. Eight years old.</p><p><br></p><p>Sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>It was only due to the support of the corrupt officials who wanted a puppet ruler that he was even there after winning the succession.</p><p><br></p><p>The Empire was really going through a rough time since the death of the previous Emperor.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at them as general Budo stood up and walked beside him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Before we say anything today, answer one question of ours. Where do your loyalties lie?”</p><p><br></p><p>The generals looked at each other and answered in a single voice.</p><p><br></p><p>“With the Emperor. With the Empire.”</p><p><br></p><p>“In that case, we will choose to trust you as well. Our soldiers. Today… we have come here to relay a very sad… and enraging news.” He spoke</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at him closer. It wasn’t her first time seeing him but today she felt a difference.</p><p><br></p><p>The young child had a look of seriousness on his face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Our parents, the previous Emperor and Empress of the Empire whom you all know had passed away due to illness… were actually murdered.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>A moment later, murmurs ran through the room.</p><p><br></p><p>The Emperor looked at General Budo and the man nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>He brought out a bundle of papers and passed it to them.</p><p><br></p><p>One by one everyone took a look at those papers.</p><p><br></p><p>Honest.</p><p><br></p><p>It was that damned Prime Minister.</p><p><br></p><p>She knew that the Prime Minister was increasing in power by a lot since the deaths of the previous Emperor and Empress.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the kid Emperor was completely under his control… or that’s what she had thought… but it doesn’t seem to be the case.</p><p><br></p><p>“What are your orders, Your Majesty?” General Liver asked, anger easily recognisable in his voice.</p><p><br></p><p>Many other generals echoed his voice.</p><p><br></p><p>The Emperor raised his hand.</p><p><br></p><p>“As you have already noticed, not all of the Empire’s generals were called here. You people were only chosen because of your loyalties for the Empire. The current Empire is riddled with Honest’s underlings. Whether it be the imperial court or the army. There are not many people whom we can trust easily. So we need your assistance. We will clean up this Empire and return it to its former glory. We might be young but we are ready to give it our all, even our own life for the betterment of the Empire. All we need is your support. Will you…. our people, support us?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Your Majesty.” Several voices rang out.</p><p><br></p><p>“Very well then. Today, we end the reign of corruption from the Empire starting with the traitorous Prime Minister, Honest. General Budo.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Your Majesty.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We command you to arrest Prime Minister Honest and his cohorts and bring them in for execution. Be careful, Honest has a Teigu called Erastone which can destroy other Teigu. Kill him if you have to but do not let him escape. I do not wish for you all to risk your lives to capture a traitor.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Your Majesty.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A few of you will stay back to protect me. Gozuki, step forward.”</p><p><br></p><p>A man stepped forward and kneeled.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are assigned to track down the previous Prime Minister, Chouri and his daughter Spear and bring them back to the Empire securely. Do not let anyone catch a wisp of this.” he ordered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Your Majesty.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Others, follow us. We will stay in the Imperial Treasury where the Teigu are stored.”</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t know what had gotten into the Emperor but she hoped that it would bring about a good change in the Empire and save it from its rapid decline.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Saelena -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“And these are the contract requests from the Gauzaberer Organisation for this half of the year.” Mephisto summoned the bundle of papers on the table.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at the towering bunch and noticed something. “These… look a bit less than the last time.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm these are around seventy percent of the last time. Many of the Magicians at Gauzaberer are currently focusing on something else.” he answered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is that something else perhaps related to a young Devil Magician whom you have hired as a teacher for a special type of Magic?” Serafall questioned.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, did you get someone good in your Organisation?” She asked curiously.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha Ace is just like his name, my Ace. he is the creator and the only teacher of a completely new branch of Magic, Transfiguration. Most of the magicians at Grauzaberer are busy learning this magic to research more.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Really? A completely new type of magic? What can it do?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I believe we have already seen what it can do six months ago.” Ajuka answered and then looked at Mephisto.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh? We did?” She asked and then it struck her. “The boy from six months ago. You found him?”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy who had caused that ruckus and brought about the changes in the system of the Ranking Examinations.</p><p><br></p><p>They had really tried to find him but didn’t get even a hint.</p><p><br></p><p>It turns out that they were looking in the wrong place.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yup. It was a lucky encounter. We talked a bit and I offered him a job. He accepted it to repay me for paying the compensation for that day.” He smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“You knew where he was hiding, right?” Ajuka asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“He was under the collar of Lavinia, waiting for an opportunity to get out when she went back. I noticed him when we were teleporting.” He laughed. “Turns out that he can use his magic to change his shape at will.”</p><p><br></p><p>Her mouth opened in surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>So he was there, just outside the room while they all searched throughout the city?</p><p><br></p><p>Mephisto summoned a book and passed it on to them. “Here’s the first book by Ace. </p><p><br></p><p>She looked at the cover of the book. ‘The Art of Transfiguration - Part 1.’</p><p><br></p><p>“He just started writing these and more will come out in the next few years. These just contain the introduction and basics of Transfiguration Magic. First edition.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ajuka opened the book while she looked at Mephisto. “What kind of guy is he?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, Ace is a….good child. I don’t know what kind of life he has lived before but he is extremely cautious of people. After knowing his personality, it wasn’t a surprise that he ran away that day and reacted the way he did. We have been working for six months and I still don’t know what he looks like?” he laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>“What?”</p><p><br></p><p>“He always keeps on a disguise. The face which you all saw that day, was not his original face. He can shapeshift. His name is most likely a fake too. The only thing I know about him is his age. He’s just fourteen years old.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And you still hired him?” Serafall asked, incredulously.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, you all tried to catch him and what did you get? I just tried a different approach.” he shrugged. “And I was correct as well. The kid might be overly cautious but has impeccable work ethics. He never once slacks off when teaching students. Not once has he done anything which has let me hear a complaint about him. He is extremely professional at work. And isn’t that what I want? He could always learn to trust me in time and open up to me. He has shown that he isn’t completely antisocial as he does get along with little Lavinia.”</p><p><br></p><p>While Mephisto was explaining about the boy, Ajuka conjured a magic circle and manipulated it. The pen in front of them turned into a beetle.</p><p><br></p><p>“How interesting.” He then turned another page of the book and continued reading.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>She ignored her friend. Over the past centuries, she knew that look already.</p><p><br></p><p>He was already out of the conversation.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh and despite his young age, his Demonic Power is comparable to a decent High Class Devil. Although, he himself is a Low Class Devil.”</p><p><br></p><p>A Low Class Devil.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did he write all this by himself?” Ajuka asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. There will apparently be around one dozen books in total according to him and this is only the first part.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. In that case I would like to order any other books from him in the future. Also, although the bills were paid, he still has to undergo two months of public <a href=\"https://service….in\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">service….in</a> the “Research and Development Department’ for his stunt.” Ajuka stated and went back to his book.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you want him to run away again?” She scolded him and then thought of a plan and turned towards Mephisto. “How long does he have a contract with you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Two and a half years left.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Great. In that case, why don’t you bring him to the Recommendation Meet in a year and a half. There he might be able to get a recommendation for the Middle Class Promotion as well as get a chance to show the whole underworld the potential of the Devils which often gets ignored. He seemed like he was dissatisfied with it. So here’s his chance to prove the people wrong.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, hunting two prey with one arrow. If he loses, the government’s stance will be proved right and he will have to accept it and if he wins, your new amendment would be proved correct. Either way, it’s your win. As expected of the Lucifer.” Mephisto smiled. “But I would recommend you all to not underestimate Ace. That boy… he will become one of the top figures in the world. In all my life, I have rarely seen that kind of drive in someone so young. I advise you to not distance him through politics.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Such high praise. You seem to have taken a liking to him, Lord Mephisto.” She smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously. I even had Tannin warn the unruly brats away. Ace, regardless of all his flaws, is a member of my organisation and someone I have great hopes for.”</p><p><br></p><p>“In that case, we too hope that he will be able to grow and become a pillar of support for the Underworld.”</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Another chapter of ‘Ace in the Hole’ is up.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Things are finally picking up pace.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The Harry Potter world is mostly sorted out….or is it?</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The kid Emperor played a Ciel Phantomhive.

The Revolutionary Army was just in its starting phases and were merely a small group of rebels.</p><p><br></p><p>I had also started practising Legilimency on the young Emperor to see more information about others but it turns out that the kid actually tells me everything honestly. This made me pity him even more. He was a genuinely good kid who wanted to help the Empire.</p><p><br></p><p>So, there was still a bit of time to prevent all that.</p><p><br></p><p>It’s just that, it was extremely difficult to do so through just a portal.</p><p><br></p><p>But while I was working towards it slowly, I did get some things from the kid Emperor in exchange for the things I traded to him.</p><p><br></p><p>And one such thing was something I was using right now.</p><p><br></p><p>The Gaea Foundation.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, I traded a Teigu with the kid Emperor… for a video game.</p><p><br></p><p>I found out some things about the Teigu. It was attracted to magic so maybe that world also had magic of some kind. The Danger Beasts could be magical beasts maybe.</p><p><br></p><p>It opened up a lot of routes for that world.</p><p><br></p><p>From what I found out, there were some extremely strong Danger Beasts and sometimes even eating parts of those beasts’ bodies was enough to gain some of its powers.</p><p><br></p><p>Even some of the Teigu were just the Blood Essence of extremely strong Danger Beasts like the Demon God Manifestation: Demon’s Extract.</p><p><br></p><p>So, there were chances that they could be hunted and more such Teigu can be produced.</p><p><br></p><p>The danger Beasts were divided into several levels.</p><p><br></p><p>Class 4, Class 3, Class 2, Class 1, Special Class and Super Class, with Class 4 being the weakest and the Super Class being the strongest.</p><p><br></p><p>The best Teigu like the Incursio Armour, Demon’s Extract and others were made from the body parts of the Super Class Danger Beasts and to get more of them, they needed to be hunted.</p><p><br></p><p>This however is easier said than done as from what I guessed, most of the Super Class Danger beasts were at least Ultimate Class level and killing them would take a lot of effort and planning.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean, just drinking the blood of one, and that too not all of it, could make Esdeath strong enough to freeze time itself so how strong must the Danger Beast itself must be.</p><p><br></p><p>Not just this, they even had many magical metals in their world too as some of their Teigu were said to have been made up of them with the Danger Beast’s parts. I recognised the name of Adamantium among the metals named.</p><p><br></p><p>From what I observed, this Artifact also used Magic but normal Humans in that world didn’t have much power so they couldn’t always be selected by a Teigu and even if they were, they couldn’t use more than one without harming themselves irreversibly as they starts absorbing their life force when overexerted. Esdeath’s and Tatsumi’s powers were exceptions as drinking the Demon’s Extract gave her some properties of the Danger Beast itself and increased her Magical Power while it was merging with Tyrant for Tatsumi.</p><p><br></p><p>But for someone like me, using these things was much easier.</p><p><br></p><p>The reason I chose this one instead of something extremely strong was because I had already finished off my reserves of the Polyjuice Potions and needed something to hide my identity.</p><p><br></p><p>And it was not as if this was weak either. This artifact allowed the user to transform into any living being they had seen and even use their natural abilities.</p><p><br></p><p>What’s interesting with this is that while humans from that world could use it, they couldn’t even come close to using the full extent of it’s abilities due to their low amounts of Magical Power.</p><p><br></p><p>It needed more energy to take on larger forms which they lacked but I didn’t.</p><p><br></p><p>Today, I had come to the capital city to sell some of the gold and jewellery which I had gotten from my trade and get some money for myself.</p><p><br></p><p>The city of New Lilith was remade after the Civil War and was the place from where The Satan Lucifer ruled the Underworld.</p><p><br></p><p>The other three Satans had other cities but since Lucifer was responsible for domestic matters, this city was the biggest centre of trade and commerce for the whole Underworld.</p><p><br></p><p>Similarly, the city which was ruled by the Beelzebub was the place where the Devil Research and Development Department was located and was famous for its advanced magic and scientific development. Not only devils but also Magicians as well as other races who came to the Underworld came here to research magic. </p><p><br></p><p>The Leviathan’s capital city was the centre for foreign affairs and the place where most tourists came from outside the Underworld. The licences for going to the Human World as well as the offices where ambassadors of different races stayed and diplomats visited was this city.</p><p><br></p><p>And finally the Asmodeus’ city was the place where the headquarters of the Underworld’s military was situated. It was surrounded by military establishments all around, Academies, Weapons Manufacturing facilities, etc.</p><p><br></p><p>The best thing about Lilith was that even other races had stores opened in a certain section of the city. They had to pay more taxes than Devils but they often attracted large crowds of people who didn’t have access to the Human World.</p><p><br></p><p>I had already visited this place a few times under different disguise to enquire about places where I could sell stuff. In fact, I could even pretend to be a trader from outside the Underworld and sell stuff. I only needed to be careful about not getting caught for not having a licence.</p><p><br></p><p>As I was thinking about this, I reached the place I was going to.</p><p><br></p><p>The place was owned by the Belial House and was a business opened by the Rating Game Champion, Diehauser Belial himself.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, the story behind this place was kinda inspiring too.</p><p><br></p><p>Around a hundred or so years ago, when Diehauser was still young and wanted to study about Rating Games, the Belial Family couldn’t afford it.</p><p><br></p><p>At that time, Lady Belial had sold her jewellery and Lord Belial had sold his own clothes to afford the money for him to be able to go to the Rating Game Academy for the High Class Devil children and pursue his dream there.</p><p><br></p><p>And as we all know now, that deed bore fruit.</p><p><br></p><p>Diehauser Belial surpassed every other Rating Game player and became the Champion, the Emperor of the Rating Games with his Skill and hard work.</p><p><br></p><p>And when he did, he bought this whole place as a gift for his parents.</p><p><br></p><p>Lady and Lord Belial had continued this business since then to help similar people in need.</p><p><br></p><p>It was the place which gave the best rates for gold and jewellery sold in the Underworld and were extremely well liked by the lower sections of the society.</p><p><br></p><p>This place was their headquarters and there were other branches all across the Underworld too.</p><p><br></p><p>I entered the place and was greeted by the staff. “I would like to see some gold and jewellery.” I reported.</p><p><br></p><p>“Please come with me.” He led me to a room beside the counter. “Show me the products.”</p><p><br></p><p>I brought out the products and he checked the products with a magic circle to check if they were genuine.</p><p><br></p><p>He calculated the price and paid the sum almost immediately.</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm.” I hesitated before asking.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am a hunter and hunt in the pits. I was wondering if you also buy some magical metals here?”</p><p><br></p><p>“We do but only for some precious ones.” He provided me with a whole list along with the prices for each metal.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly left the place to go to my next destination.</p><p><br></p><p>The city where Satan Beelzebub lived.</p><p><br></p><p>Lucifaad.</p><p><br></p><p>But I didn’t go there directly. First I went to a different town where I changed my disguise again, this time taking the form of a young devil.</p><p><br></p><p>Lucifaad didn’t allow people to teleport there willy-nilly. They had to have special permission.</p><p><br></p><p>Apart from that, there were checks before entering the city and each and every part of the city was under surveillance by the people under Ajuka Beelzebub.</p><p><br></p><p>Not even a fly could escape their notice so changing disguise inside the city was highly dangerous.</p><p><br></p><p>But there was a reason I was visiting this place.</p><p><br></p><p>It was the only place where the latest games as well as electrical appliances from the Human World were available.</p><p><br></p><p>I needed to make trades with the Emperor and for that I needed more things.</p><p><br></p><p>So I went on a shopping spree.</p><p><br></p><p>While getting the things I needed, I got a phone for myself to be able to check the Devil Net and some books on the Human Magic System to see if I could trade them with others in different worlds for something useful.</p><p><br></p><p>While walking through the place, my eyes were attracted to a stall which sold wands and magic staffs.</p><p><br></p><p>Getting an extra wand or staff would be helpful as I didn’t use the Elder Wand much during the hunts to prevent it from getting damaged. </p><p><br></p><p>“Welcome, what do you want to buy?” The magician who owned the stall looked bored.</p><p><br></p><p>“A Magic Staff or Wand suitable for me. Any suggestions?”</p><p><br></p><p>“All these staffs were made to suit the Demonic Power of Devils but you need to know Human Magic to use them.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Do you mind if I check one?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure, go on.”</p><p><br></p><p>I picked one of them and tried using the Harry Potter Magic with it, a simple levitation spell. It worked so I tried something more complicated.</p><p><br></p><p>A basic transfiguration spell.</p><p><br></p><p>Turning a button into a beetle.</p><p><br></p><p>It worked again.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wow. That was amazing.” I heard the exclaim from behind me. Looking back I saw a blonde girl with blue eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked to be around twelve years or so.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at me with an amazed expression on her face. “How did you do that?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm, magic.” I replied, stepping back a bit from her, who was almost at my face.</p><p><br></p><p>“So amazing. I have never seen a magic like that.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am sure others can do it too.” I replied, waving the thing off and turned towards the shop owner and handed him a staff and a wand. “I would like to purchase these.”</p><p><br></p><p>The owner however didn’t move and was staring at me as if looking at a ghost. He quickly used a spell which I didn’t recognise on the beetle and snapped back at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes?”</p><p><br></p><p>“What kind of magic was that?” He asked, stunned.</p><p><br></p><p>“Just a basic transfiguration.” I replied, unsure while paying the amount. “Will this be enough?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes yes it’s enough. You can even take it for free if you make a contract with me and let me study your magic.” He jumped up excitedly.</p><p><br></p><p>This attracted the attention of some people.</p><p><br></p><p>It was at this moment that I sensed something wrong. “I am sorry but I have prior commitments. I am sure you can find some other Devil to do so. My spell was not that special anyways” I replied, stepping back a bit.</p><p><br></p><p>“No no. I have never seen anything like this before. I don’t think I know of any Devil who can make life with magic.” he blurted out.</p><p><br></p><p>My lips parted slightly in shock as I realised my mistake. “It wasn’t life, just basic magic.” I replied, stepping back and trying to find a way out of the crowd which was gathering from the commotion.</p><p><br></p><p>“No, no wait.” He tried to say something else but I found an opening and quickly walked away from there.</p><p><br></p><p>The man tried to come after me and a few people even asked him what had happened.</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly ran away realising that he was explaining the events to them.</p><p><br></p><p>How did I mess up with such a simple task?</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Lavinia Reni -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She watched as the magicians looked around for the boy all over the place in confusion.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am telling you it is not an illusion. Here, look at it yourself if you don’t believe me.” The shop owner was showing the beetle which he had trapped under the glass.</p><p><br></p><p>She personally thought that the beetle looked quite cute.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is going on here?” An authoritative voice sounded and everyone looked behind to see a group of people coming towards them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Lavinia, what are you doing here?” One man from that group asked her. He was a middle aged man with gelled hair, which was a mixture of red and blue. He had heterochromia; his left eye was blue, while the right was red.</p><p><br></p><p>The head of her new magician organisation, Mephistopheles.</p><p><br></p><p>The ones with him went ahead to control the crowd.</p><p><br></p><p>“I…” She explained the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>“Turned a button into a beetle? Are you sure he didn’t just swap places between the two with his magic?” He asked, while going over to the shop where the beetle was kept and many magicians were standing around it.</p><p><br></p><p>The magicians moved aside as they looked at the group.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. I saw it change into a beetle, not disappear and appear as a beetle.” She explained.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the people from his group, a man with green hair and blue eyes, was checking the beetle. “How surprising. This insect doesn’t have a soul but the rest of its body is truly alive.”</p><p><br></p><p>\"Really?\" Mephistopheles quickly walked forward and did a few checks of his own. “How curious indeed.” He then turned to her and questioned. “Did you see who did this?”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Where is he?”</p><p><br></p><p>“He… ran away.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ran away?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The people here wanted to make contracts with him and he didn’t want to so he… ran away.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Not a people’s person eh? How sad. Do you think you can find him, Ajuka?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, let me see.” He conjured a magic circle and images appeared in them. “These are the camera feeds from this place from thirty minutes ago. Can you identify who the caster was?”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at the circle and saw the scene of the boy coming to the stall. “This one.”</p><p><br></p><p>They saw the scene from just a while ago and then saw the boy running away.</p><p><br></p><p>“That was….strange. But it did look like he did the magic.” Mephistopehes said.</p><p><br></p><p>The circle in the green haired devil’s hand turned and followed the boy through the cameras and found his location.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, let’s leave it at that. The people here just freaked the poor kid out and he ran away. But yes, the magic was interesting. I will send someone to talk and invite him in if you want to see his magic but we have an important meeting right now. Let’s not delay it any longer.” One of the people in the group said and looked at another person. “Invite the boy. Just take his information if he doesn’t want to come. Don’t force him.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.” A man, probably a servant, replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm, can I go there too?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>She liked the magic and wanted to see it again.</p><p><br></p><p>The group looked at her. “Sure. Just stay with them.” Mephisto said and left with them.</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded and followed the man.</p><p><br></p><p>A few minutes later, they were outside the place where the boy was seen.</p><p><br></p><p>“Be careful, miss. It is not dangerous but just don’t get lost.”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded and both of them entered the place.</p><p><br></p><p>The man looked around and stopped when he spotted the boy.</p><p><br></p><p>They walked behind him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Excuse me.” He called the boy who turned around surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am a subordinate of Lord Ajuka Beelzebub.”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy looked at the man open mouthed and even she turned towards the man in shock.</p><p><br></p><p>Those people were the Satans?</p><p><br></p><p>“We just so happened to hear about the incident at the stall earlier. You were invited by Lord Beelzebub to discuss.”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy was still shocked and backed away a few steps. “I just came here to buy a few things and did not do anything illegal. May I know why I’m being invited?”</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t need to be worried. Lord Beelzebub was just interested in your magic and wanted to know more about it.”</p><p><br></p><p>The look on the boy’s face hardened.</p><p><br></p><p>“Can I decline?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Excuse me?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I do not like showing my magic to anyone and would like to keep it a personal secret. I apologise for not being able to follow you.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure? You don’t know the kind of opportunity you’re missing.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am very sure.” The boy answered, trying to leave the place when the man walked in front of him. “What is the meaning of this?”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Acelin -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Just how in the seven heavens did I get stuck in this mess?</p><p><br></p><p>The plan was all perfect.</p><p><br></p><p>How did that simple trick of magic fuck things up to this extent?</p><p><br></p><p>Ajuka Beelzebub.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s cheating.</p><p><br></p><p>I just came out of the beginner’s village.</p><p><br></p><p>Why am I meeting a raid boss all of a sudden?</p><p><br></p><p>If I get taken to Ajuka, I would be caught by him for sure for being in a disguise and they would question me about the magic which would bring about a whole new can of worms out in the open.</p><p><br></p><p>Nope, I needed to leave.</p><p><br></p><p>But that wouldn’t be so easy.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy in front of me was strong.</p><p><br></p><p>I wouldn’t last a minute against him. Not that fighting was an option in the first place.</p><p><br></p><p>I needed to create a diversion, a big one and then escape under a different disguise.</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly thought of a plan and began my act.</p><p><br></p><p>“Can I check your information?” He asked and the people around also began to look at the scene.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. So it’s that again. Since you have no reason to bring me against my will, why not create one right. It’s not the first time I have seen High Class Devils or above pull this trick to steal from Low Class Devils like me. And now it’s the Satans themselves.” I started speaking while I began weaving my magic.</p><p><br></p><p>Occlumency was shoving any unnecessary thoughts and fear to the back of the brain.</p><p><br></p><p>A diversion big enough for me to disappear.</p><p><br></p><p>The man in front of me narrowed his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you know what you are saying, boy?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Am I lying though? Since the Evil Piece system has come, hundreds of reincarnated devils have reached the High Class Rank. True. The Satans have done a lot of work for them. I accept that… but… how many natural born Low Class Devils have been able to advance to the same stage? I know several Low Class Devils who are as strong as Ultimate Class ones and are still forced to work in stone quarries because of their rank with no hope of ever rising. The new Satans might have worked well for the Reincarnated Devils but they have failed the original people of the Devil race and I… want nothing to do with any of them. If one day they get up from the comfort of their thrones and decide to actually do something substantial for the people rather than dressing up in fake superhero costumes for propaganda… I will talk to them. Please step aside.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Your words tread on treason. You will be coming with me for questioning.” he drew his sword, wary of the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>Bingo.</p><p><br></p><p>“Very well. Remember, you forced me to do this.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Wha…”</p><p><br></p><p>I cast an overpowered Lumos in the room, making him cover his eyes as I let my original spell roar.</p><p><br></p><p>The surroundings, the tables, the chairs, the whole restaurant… turned into a wave of beetles swarming all over the place. I didn't know more advanced transfiguration spells so I went full power with the one I did.</p><p><br></p><p>As the swarm of beetles covered me and swarmed towards the surroundings, I used the Gaea Foundation and transformed into a… beetle and hid in the best position I could find.</p><p><br></p><p>Good luck trying to find me.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Mephistopheles -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“And that’s all of the contracts from my organisation.” he reported as he got up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you for your hard work, Lord Pheles. We will inspect the list of people who wish to study here from your organisation and give you the list of the ones selected. I apologise but we don’t have enough seats as the other Magician organisations have already submitted their name lists.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh don’t mind that. I like my job at the organisation. This is just a part of it. As for the ones who didn't qualify, they were just not good enough. They can always try the next time.” he replied as they walked out of the meeting room.</p><p><br></p><p>The scene outside was a bit off though.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is going on here?” Ajuka stepped forward and asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sir… that boy…” The man stuttered.</p><p><br></p><p>“What happened to the boy?”</p><p><br></p><p>“He ran away.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What?”</p><p><br></p><p>The man explained the scene and a frown appeared on the faces of the young Satans.</p><p><br></p><p>“So he was not one of your fans.” he said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Reincarnated Devils are mostly people who are selected for their talents and powers so their average talents are more than natural born Low Class Devils. Some people are indeed disappointed by the rapid rise of the reincarnated devils but it is not because of our bias but rather because of their own hard work.” Serafall said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh really? How many?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“How many reincarnated devils have been promoted till now?” he asked.</p><p><br></p><p>The other three Satans looked towards Ajuka who conjured up a magic circle and replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“Over a thousand.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. And how many of the Native Devils?”</p><p><br></p><p>He paused a second and looked at the data for a moment before replying. “Fifty.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s a twenty-fold difference. Now try searching for the ones who did so independently while not serving any houses.” he asked.</p><p><br></p><p>They looked at him and he shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>Ajuka made some adjustments and his face took a serious look.</p><p><br></p><p>“How many is it?” Serafall asked, becoming impatient.</p><p><br></p><p>“...two.”</p><p><br></p><p>“In the last four hundred years or so only two native devils have independently been promoted to High Class Devils. If I recall correctly, the number was in the thousands during the Great War. The standards of the previous Satans were much stricter in terms of power at least but all of those who were given the position did qualify for it. I can understand Serafall’s reasoning for the rapid rise of the Reincarnated Devils but… putting everything on the difference of talent alone to justify these numbers… doesn’t seem right. There have been several rebellions in many territories and now even such a young boy is saying such words. Maybe you all should actually look into the core of the problems rather than unilaterally crushing them first.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you saying that the boy was right, Lord Pheles?” Falbium asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you saying he was wrong, Lord Asmodeus?” he countered.</p><p><br></p><p>There were no answers.</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t like to involve myself in politics and the Rating Games so I will not argue with you all about this, that said… I have been in this place before, even the previous Satans. I have seen these people being born and die in these lands. I know very well what they are capable of but it seems that you all haven’t realised it yet. Just friendly advice from an oldtimer like me. The thing which the boy said about Ultimate Class Devils being forced to do manual labour… was not a lie. Such treatment is bound to cause them to harbour resentment. How you take it is on all of you.” he shrugged. “Come Lavinia.”</p><p><br></p><p>The girl followed him and he invoked his Magic Circle to teleport them out of there but before he did, he turned around, \"Also, send me the bills for the trouble the boy caused here. I will pay for the damages. With this said, light enveloped them and they disappeared from the place.</p><p><br></p><p>They appeared at the headquarters of the Grauzauberer Magician organisation, in his private office. </p><p><br></p><p>He activated the barrier of the room and then turned towards Lavinia.</p><p><br></p><p>“You can come out now. It’s safe here.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Lavinia just tilted her head.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Serafall Leviathan -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>They watched the video together to see the incident with their own eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“He was using a wand to cast the spell. There, his hand was touching the wand under his sleeves.” Falbium pointed out.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, it wasn’t visible from the other side’s angle but looking closer, there was a mark on his sleeves meaning he was hiding something there.</p><p><br></p><p>They watched as the whole place turned into a swarm of beetles, covering him and flying outwards and when they moved away, he was no longer there.</p><p><br></p><p>“He teleported using the misdirection.” Grayfia said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mmh… or maybe not. Teleportation is banned in certain areas of the town, especially in such buildings to prevent accidents and as such, there are small barriers to prevent teleportation. They can however be overpowered if the user is strong enough but that was not the case in the scene. There were no lights or magic circle seen but more importantly, why would he have the swarm of insects cover him if he just wanted to teleport?” Falbium pointed it out.</p><p><br></p><p>“So…”</p><p><br></p><p>“He could probably transform into a beetle as well. Well, good luck finding the kid now. Even the cameras around the city would be useless.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What do you think, Ajuka?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“He needs existing matter to cast the spell. Is the mass preserved? There were no incantations for the spell but the boy had to prepare the spell for a while. I wonder what’s the limit for this? Can he create intelligent life or is it just like the Annihilation Maker?” He murmured.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Not that… what do you think about the method the boy used to escape?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh… I apologise, I was a bit distracted.” He said and the corner of her lips twitched. “But yes, he transformed into a beetle himself and is probably out of the town already. I have had my people capture as many of those insects as I could to experiment on them but the chance that any of them is the boy is negligible.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sigh… so, do you think he was a criminal and was just buying time with his words to cast the spell?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Maybe… maybe not. I don’t know. But if I had to take a guess, I would say that he was probably clear and actually afraid of being caught in some trouble. That’s why he ran away. The words he said… were not completely untrue. There are High Class Devils who abuse the power which comes with their position while the native Devils don’t get easy access to the Human World to make contracts. We decided to reduce their trips to the human world back then because we were protecting ourselves from people who were ambushing them through contracts while we were severely weakened due to the Civil War. It’s just that… we never changed the rules because everything was working well.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So that means…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, even now, the native Devils need to reach the Middle Class level before they can go to the human world. This makes their chances of advancing to the next level extremely slow. Not to mention, rarely any High Class Devil chooses peerage members from these people so, two of the three methods of advancing to the next stage is not available to them. As for the merits in battles, there have been no wars for the last few hundred years and thus no promotions.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“But there was an examination for the advancement of the general population ,right?” </p><p><br></p><p>“There is one every decade and can be used to promote two hundred Devils, but even that one requires the recommendation of High Class Devils. They mostly only recommend their own people, maids, butlers and such so the normal people never get a recommendation.” Ajuka brought out the rules and read.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“So… if someone cannot get a job under a High Class Devil and get a recommendation from them…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then they cannot become a Middle Class Devil regardless of their strength. The Pillar Houses have kept this system in place to keep a firm hold over the populace for thousands of years but with the growing number of Reincarnated Middle and High Class Devils, it’s making things worse.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sigh, what a mess. When is the next Promotion Examination?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Two years later.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“What are you planning?”</p><p><br></p><p>“We pass a law for the removal of the recommendation from the High Class Devils to be a requirement to sit in the Middle Class Promotion Examination for native Devils.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The council will be a pain as it will remove a part of their powers.” She countered.</p><p><br></p><p>“I know. It is highly unlikely that it will be passed so we have a Plan B. Every decade, the four Great Satans will give recommendations to two hundred people as well. But we do not hand out these recommendations to just anyone but rather hold a competition for anyone to participate. It would bring out various talents like the boy from today and showcase their talents to the Underworld as well as catch the eye of other High Class people. In this way, no one can blame us for trying to increase our own power.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s….a surprisingly good plan. If we make a public announcement about this, especially after the council rejects the amendment, we can pull a fast one over them and attract the favourable opinion of the public as well.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The council will have nothing to do with it. We can have two hundred of our High Class subordinates at High Class level or above recommend those people. This way, we would not be doing anything against the law.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm that’s actually doable.” Falbium thought and spoke.</p><p><br></p><p>“What did you think? I’m the Lucifer. I have learned a lot dealing with those annoying council members.” Saelena flicked a strand of her crimson hair behind her ears as she smirked.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, she was quite sharp about such things. She wasn’t the Lucifer just because of her incredible strength but also due to her political skills. </p><p><br></p><p>“By the way… what do we do about the boy?”</p><p><br></p><p>“What about him? Mephistopheles is already paying for the damages. If the boy is found, he does public services for two months and is let off. That’s it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Two months of public service in the Research and Development Department under me.” Ajuka added.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s final then.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Acelin -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I stood in front of the two people, thinking of a plan to run away.</p><p><br></p><p>Back then the gut had started attacking the transfigured beetles so I had hidden in the best place I could, under the collar of the girl.</p><p><br></p><p>What I wasn’t expecting was to get dragged from the frying pan into the fire.</p><p><br></p><p>My luck today has been exceptionally shitty.</p><p><br></p><p>And I had even taken a sip of the Luck Potion before the whole fiasco so that I encountered some good things to buy.</p><p><br></p><p>That fucker Dumbledore didn’t give me fake Luck Potions, did he?</p><p><br></p><p>And to think that the girl I chose was her….Lavinia Reni, the wielder of the Absolute Demise.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy in front of me however wasn’t interested in my inner musings and interrupted my thoughts.</p><p><br></p><p>“So you can change yourself into a beetle too. That’s quite convenient. Would you be introducing yourself? I heard what you said back then and trust me when I say, I have no need for anything you have.”</p><p><br></p><p>“... why?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>The man shrugged. “It’s refreshing to see someone speak up their mind like that. Not to mention someone as talented as you.”</p><p><br></p><p>I narrowed my eyes. “The first thing my teacher taught me is that nothing in this world is free. So… what do you want?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, a wise man. Then… how about you working here?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do I have to join your peerage?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm? Who said you have to join my peerage? Although, I won’t deny it if you wanted to. You will be free to do as you want. I am not exactly interested in Rating Games and the only other Peerage Member I have is my Queen, Tannin and he does whatever he wants.” he explained.</p><p><br></p><p>I would say that it was a very attractive opportunity but… I was already a Devil. Becoming a Devil under him didn’t give me something I couldn’t obtain with my own hard work.</p><p><br></p><p>So, I didn’t answer for a while.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, it seems you don’t trust other people much. Since that’s the case, we can make a deal. A deal between two devils. I won’t brag but I am quite well known for keeping my side of the deals.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What deal?” I asked, suspicious.</p><p><br></p><p>“You teach here for three years and in turn I will protect you and provide you with all facilities of a teacher according to your skill. At the end of three years, you can leave if you want to and I will help you solve whatever happened today. During this time, I won’t interfere with your personal work provided it’s not illegal. I mean you must understand that even I can only protect you so much. You can even consider this as repaying me for saving your skin today.”</p><p><br></p><p>I thought over his offer for a while and nodded but not before ironing the details to remove any loopholes.</p><p><br></p><p>Mephisto handed me a card to signify my position as a teacher at Grauzauberer.</p><p><br></p><p>“Great then. You will be starting your work one month from now. I will take care of the matter of the beetle infestation during that time. By the way, what is your name and how old are you? I need to register you as a member of the Grauzauberer Magician Organisation.”</p><p><br></p><p>“My name is… Ace. I’m fourteen years old.” I replied after thinking for a moment.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ace, was it? And fourteen years old… that’s quite young. Alright, welcome to Grauzauberer.”</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>Two weeks had passed since I had joined Grauzauberer Magician Organisation.</p><p><br></p><p>It was founded by Jonnan Georg Faust, the original Faust and the man who made a deal with Mephisto Pheles. In reality, he was the contracted magician of Mephisto.</p><p><br></p><p>After his death, Mephisto took the position of the chairman of the organisation and has led it since then.</p><p><br></p><p>The name Grauzauberer means ‘the Grey Wizards’ and is based in Germany.</p><p><br></p><p>A good thing about Grauzauberer compared to the other big Magician Organisations is that they are more free in terms of rules whereas Golden Dawn or others were extremely strict.</p><p><br></p><p>After registering me as a teacher, Mephisto made an identity for me to use in the Human World. Right now, I was under his protection and thus could make contracts with Humans with his given permission.</p><p><br></p><p>I was even provided with the Summoning Contracts although not with any Magic Circles because I rejected them.</p><p><br></p><p>I wasn’t sure if they would be rigged.</p><p><br></p><p>I would rather buy them later on by myself.</p><p><br></p><p>But I had more important things to think about.</p><p><br></p><p>In these two weeks, I had locked myself in a room and practised Transfiguration Magic with all my might and I had completed the first three years of the Transfiguration Spells taught in the school.</p><p><br></p><p>The Diadem of Rowena Ravenclaw helped a lot in doing so.</p><p><br></p><p>I still had two more weeks before I would start teaching so I was preparing to complete studying the books and theory.</p><p><br></p><p>There were some differences in the spells when I used them compared to what was written in the books.</p><p><br></p><p>My guess was that it was due to my Demonic Power affecting the spells.</p><p><br></p><p>I will have to test this with other people before I start teaching.</p><p><br></p><p>Just as I was thinking of these things, I sensed a summoning.</p><p><br></p><p>I hadn’t been able to give much time to contracts in these last two weeks except the regular talks with the Emperor.</p><p><br></p><p>I fixed things around myself to respond to the summoning.</p><p><br></p><p>A familiar scene greeted me on the other side of the portal.</p><p><br></p><p>Albus Dumbledore.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my, what a surprise. What do you need me for today, Albus Dumbledore?”</p><p><br></p><p>He threw a shrunk trunk towards me which I accepted and enlarged before opening to check its contents.</p><p><br></p><p>It was the remaining payment. Bottles of Luck Potion, gold as well as books on many topics of magic, five vials of Phoenix Tears, one Phoenix Feather and the best part of it all, the trunk itself. The space inside it was huge.</p><p><br></p><p>I had asked him for a case similar to Newt Scamander’s.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, what do you know? You did get all the payment. We are even now.” I smiled at the guy.</p><p><br></p><p>He hesitated a bit.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh ho, I am sensing another deal here.”</p><p><br></p><p>He stiffened a bit and looked at me and nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Go on, state what you desire.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I… wish to know what you know about Sirius Black’s involvement in the deaths of James and Lily Potter and a way to prove his innocence if he is uninvolved.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sirius? Yes, I do know. Then, what do I get in return?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Tell your price.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm… let me think.”</p><p><br></p><p>I thought of the plan and an idea struck me.</p><p><br></p><p>“How about… you teach me everything you know about Transfiguration and Alchemy and I will even throw in another offer and remove the soul fragment from little Harry..”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Excuse me?” The man looked confused, not expecting such a request so I clarified.</p><p><br></p><p>“I’ll be honest, surprising for a devil but what can I do? I was roped into teaching some humans about Human Transfiguration Magic but I have no idea about teaching someone so… you teach me. The things I do for a deal.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“You… wish to learn… to teach others?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s a deal and I don’t skive on my side of a bargain. You should know that better than anyone else. While it’s not my place if they transfigure themselves into pigs, it would still leave a bad taste in my mouth and a stain on my reputation. I won’t have any of that.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man looked stunned, still trying to figure out what he was hearing.</p><p><br></p><p>My eyes twitched at his reaction.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, do you agree or not?” I impatiently asked for a reply.</p><p><br></p><p>He broke out of his stupor and nodded his head, still confused.</p><p><br></p><p>“Great then. Every day, you will teach me for an hour minimum regarding Transfiguration. Everything you know about it.”</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled and continued. “As for Sirius Black. The guy is innocent. They had changed the secret keeper after you left. The actual secret keeper was Peter Pettigrew. Sirius went mad with grief since he was the one who had suggested the change and thought he had killed his friends. As for how to save him… Peter Pettigrew is still alive. He has been hiding as a rat of the Wesley Family since then and must be in Hogwarts Castle right now, sleeping beside the boy whose parents he betrayed. Go on. Finish that first and then come back and teach me.”</p><p><br></p><p>I ignored his shocked reaction and closed the portal.</p><p><br></p><p>Well, that solved the problem of learning Transfiguration at a good enough speed without fumbling around with books.</p><p><br></p><p>I was wondering what I would do next when I heard a knock on my door. With a wave of my wand, things were packed away and the trunk shrunk as I hung it from my neck.</p><p><br></p><p>On opening the door, a familiar face appeared in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>Lavinia Reni.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ace, I have come to play again.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>During this time, Lavinia had often visited me.</p><p><br></p><p>I found out that she had recently joined the organisation after her teacher was killed by Augusta of the Wizards of Oz. She wanted to find and kill that witch to avenge her teacher.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl was feeling quite lonely as there wasn’t anyone she knew in this place and I was the only one around her age who she talked to.</p><p><br></p><p>Most of the students around our age found her weird and maintained their distance. Sometimes children can be such bastards.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t know what the situation was in this world as not everything was the same as the world from the novels. Hell, even the Lucifer was a woman in this world instead of the one I knew.</p><p><br></p><p>But Lavinia’s teacher in my memories… had actually abandoned her willingly and was actually one of the members of the Wizards of Oz. If that was really the case here, she would be a broken mess.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl was too pure and optimistic. I almost felt bad thinking about such a situation.</p><p><br></p><p>“Were you busy?” She asked while making herself comfortable on my bed already, looking at me with pleading eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>I waved my wand and a pillow was transfigured into a bunny.</p><p><br></p><p>Her eyes lit up and she hugged the bunny instantly and began playing with it.</p><p><br></p><p>She loved to play with the animals which I transfigured for practice.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you make a new spell today?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. Just tried something different.” I replied and put aside my wand and got up to take a break. “How were your classes?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. It was good. I was taught ice magic.” She took out her wand and created a snowflake on its tip to show me. “Amazing, right?”</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled at her expectant gaze. “Yes. Very amazing.”</p><p><br></p><p>It was quite refreshing to have someone like her around.</p><p><br></p><p>Till now, only Dave was someone I had trusted and even then it took me a few years to fully trust him but Lavinia had somehow burrowed her way into my life very quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>Man… Dave must be worried too.</p><p><br></p><p>I want to send him a message somehow but I am not sure if it will be tracked and they will find a trace about my real identity.</p><p><br></p><p>Till now, I was using the Gaea Foundation to keep up my disguise when outside.</p><p><br></p><p>It did consume my power but the consumption wasn’t high enough to be a problem. Not to mention, it was a good way to train my reserves too.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall, I was getting fairly used to my new life in this place.</p><p><br></p><p>____________________________________x_________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>Two more weeks had passed.</p><p><br></p><p>The time was more or less uneventful except the fact that I had started my lessons with Dumbledore from the next day.</p><p><br></p><p>And I have to say that the man was a genuine master of the subject.</p><p><br></p><p>I learned more in a single hour with him that I had learned in all this time by myself. The Ravenclaw’s Diadem helped as well but the man’s talent was without a doubt.</p><p><br></p><p>I am pretty sure that if he became a Devil, he could easily rise to an Ultimate Class level in time.</p><p><br></p><p>With two weeks of continuous lessons, I could do all transfiguration spells till the fourth year syllabus and was halfway through the fifth year things.</p><p><br></p><p>My progress was quite frightening if I do say so myself.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, it was enough for me to conduct a lecture for people who had no idea about the subject.</p><p><br></p><p>I won’t be making a fool of myself in class tomorrow.</p><p><br>Apart from that, my talks with the Emperor were going smoothly. I used my conversations to push some thoughts into his head, making him doubt Honest and think more cautiously.</p><p><br></p><p>With enough time, I am sure I can get him to clean up that bastard.</p><p><br></p><p>The phone in my room rang and I picked up the call.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ace. Come to my office. We need to discuss a few things before your first lecture tomorrow.” It was Mephisto’s voice on the other end of the call.</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay.”</p><p><br></p><p>I got ready and went to his office and knocked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Come in.”</p><p><br></p><p>Mephisto was alone in his office, doing some paperwork. He looked up at me and spoke. “Take a seat. I was just working on the paperwork for your class.”</p><p><br></p><p>I listened.</p><p><br></p><p>“As you know, your magic is quite… rare. Not completely unheard of but extremely rare and as such it has never been taught before. Tomorrow, you will be giving a presentation in front of your crowd. From that, people can choose to sign up for your lectures. How many people you can get is all on you so give it your all.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Mephisto Pheles -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He sat in front of the lecture hall, waiting for the lecture to start as he recalled the things he had been able to find about the boy in all this time.</p><p><br></p><p>It took him several spells to find out that he was always under a disguise and the name he gave was probably a lie too.</p><p><br></p><p>The only thing which was true was his age.</p><p><br></p><p>He wondered just what kind of life a kid like him had lived to develop such an attitude.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, from his one month observation, he could assess that the boy didn’t have any ill intentions towards other people and just wanted to grow stronger on his own.</p><p><br></p><p>He wanted to become someone who didn’t have to suffer like the Low Class Devils did.</p><p><br></p><p>Honestly, this goal was something he could appreciate rather than some kind of foolish rebellion which would have only gotten him killed.</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully, it seemed he was getting close to Lavinia.</p><p><br></p><p>He had been a bit worried when she hadn’t been accepted by the other students at the organisation due to her….unique character.</p><p><br></p><p>Anyways, getting a wielder of a Longinus to side with the organisation would be a great boon and if he could get a talented magician as well, that’s just a cherry on the cake.</p><p><br></p><p>It was actually funny that the boy hadn’t even realised how rare his own magic was all this time.</p><p><br></p><p>He was doing something which only a handful of people could do and probably something nearing the level of the Annihilation Maker in a sense.</p><p><br></p><p>What was the scope of this magic?</p><p><br></p><p>What was the scope of the boy himself?</p><p><br></p><p>There is always a very fierce competition between the different Magician Organisations and he didn’t want to accept it but in terms of top level talents, his Organisation was lacking a bit compared to the Golden Dawn and Rosenkreuzer.</p><p><br></p><p>Faust was a rare talent but while they had strong people in Grauzauberer, they were not geniuses like Mcgregor Mathews or Rudiger Rosenkreuz.</p><p><br></p><p>But he hoped that Ace would change this.</p><p><br></p><p>Ace entered the room, dressed in a formal magician robe, a black wand on his side.</p><p><br></p><p>“Welcome everyone. My name is Ace and I will be presenting to everyone a magic of my own creation. I call it Transfiguration Magic. It is a branch of magic that focuses on the alteration of the form or appearance of an object, animal or person, via the alteration of their molecular structure. I call it magic but it is just as much science as it is magic.” He poured himself a glass of water, took a sip of it and kept the rest on the table in front of him and waved his wand.</p><p><br></p><p>The glass morphed into a bird in front of the amazed eyes of everyone.</p><p><br></p><p>“I had once heard someone say that billions of years ago, the whole universe was formed from gas clouds. So, everything that exists today was once the same thing. In other words, it should be possible to change things between each other. This was my basic thought when making this magic and this is the result. And it’s not as if this hadn’t existed before. Alchemy uses this concept as well. It’s just that there has never been a magic which can directly transfigure things without the complicated alchemical processes.\" He tapped the bird with the wand and it turned into a towel which he used to wipe his wand and then dropped it on the ground, waving the wand at it, making a chair before taking a seat.</p><p><br></p><p>“Transfiguration is a very systematic, exact magical discipline, working best for the scientifically-inclined mind and, as such, is exceptionally hard work, especially in comparison to other forms of magic. When transfiguring, it is important to make firm and decisive wand movements. Do not wiggle or twirl your wand unnecessarily, or the Transfiguration will certainly be unsuccessful.”</p><p><br></p><p>The entire room had gone silent and everyone was just gawking at the boy in front of them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Before we proceed, let me warn you all. This is an extremely dangerous branch of magic. You could die a million ways from a single glass of water if you mess up the transfiguration so don’t be hasty and join my classes at your own risk. If anyone doesn’t have the resolve to pursue this, do both yourself and me a favour….leave the class and don’t waste our time.”</p><p><br></p><p>He stared at them for a while.</p><p><br></p><p>No one among the three hundred and fifty people left, their eyes stuck to the stage.</p><p><br></p><p>Mephisto smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Another chapter of ‘Ace in the Hole’ is up.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>A lot of things happened in this chapter.</strong></p><p><strong><br>Basically, Ace took a walk.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>And things happened.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Luck is a strange thing.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Also yes, we have a Fem.

What year is it?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I-I am twelve years old, sir. It’s 1992.” He replied quite hesitantly.</p><p><br></p><p>Twelve.</p><p><br></p><p>So a second year.</p><p><br></p><p>Recollecting the events I could remember, this was when the Chamber of Secrets took place.</p><p><br></p><p>People turned on him for being a Parseltongue. The fraud teacher. The Horcrux which was even in contact with him. The petrified children and the roaming Basilisk.</p><p><br></p><p>I could see why someone like him would summon me.</p><p><br></p><p>He was familiar with talking diaries so Summoning Contracts which attracted the ones with desires was sure to catch his senses. Moreover, his lack of knowledge of the Magical World played to my advantage and led to him summoning me.</p><p><br></p><p>That said…  What could I trade from him?</p><p><br></p><p>I thought about it.</p><p><br></p><p>The only thing I could think of is his Invisibility Cloak. It should help me with my hunts, especially when coupled with my own Clan Trait.</p><p><br></p><p>But it would be hard.</p><p><br></p><p>First let’s see what he wants.</p><p><br></p><p>I can decide what I will ask later on.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is it that you desire, child?” I asked, pretending to be bored.</p><p><br></p><p>“I… my friend, Hermione is petrified and they are removing Dumbledore out. Please… can you help me?”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Oh.</p><p><br></p><p>So the story is already here.</p><p><br></p><p>I thought back to the story.</p><p><br></p><p>Dumbledore is being forced out.</p><p><br></p><p>Which means he still hasn’t been forced out yet but the process is going on.</p><p><br></p><p>Let’s see what I can get out of this.</p><p><br></p><p>“I can obviously but… every deal needs a payment. What can you pay, boy?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I...” he thought for a second and then brought gold coins from his pocket in a hurry. “Here. I have more. I can give you more if you want.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the coins and was really tempted. It could make my life easier for a while but… that would be such a waste.</p><p><br></p><p>As I thought, the only thing worth trading from him was the Cloak… but there were others who could be used.</p><p><br></p><p>My head ran quickly thinking of a plan.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I can help you but gold is not good enough for a deal this big… after all, lives are at a stake here. You did hear the whispers, didn't you?\" I asked, throwing the bait.</p><p><br></p><p>He will not trade the cloak at first but he will do it for sure….given a good enough deal.</p><p><br></p><p>\"H-h-how did you know?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I know a lot of things, kid.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Do you know who it is? Who did this to Hermione?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Slow down a bit. One thing at a time. First tell me, where did you find my contract?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"… it was in Hermione's hand when she got petrified.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Oh, so she found it. Good. Now, I can tell you the information you want to know but it will require a price. One thousand Galleons. If you agree, we can get right into it.\"</p><p><br></p><p><strong>– Harry Potter –</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He ran at full speed towards the headmaster's office. Dumbledore could be removed at any moment and things would get worse.</p><p><br></p><p>The gargoyle statue arrived soon and he said the password from the last time.</p><p><br></p><p>It worked.</p><p><br></p><p>With the stairs in front of him, he ran as fast as he could, directly into the headmaster's office. </p><p><br></p><p>Inside, Dumbledore was present along with Professor Mcgonagall and Snape.</p><p><br></p><p>\"What is the meaning of this…\" Snape began to shout but he didn't wait for him and directly spoke to Dumbledore. </p><p><br></p><p>\"It's a basilisk. It is travelling through the pipes. I can hear it. The entrance is at the second floor girls bathroom.\" He spoke.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone was taken aback at this but Snape soon gained his bearing and walked towards him, grabbing his hand. “Always have to create a scene. Can never get enough attention, can you, Potter?”</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t look at him and continued to speak to Dumbledore. “Please Sir. One word. I just need to tell you one word and you will believe me. Please.” he begged.</p><p><br></p><p>“Enough of the nonsense!” Snape shouted.</p><p><br></p><p>“That will be enough, Serverus. Let him speak.” Dumbledore said.</p><p><br></p><p>“You can’t possibly believe in the nonsense this brat is speaking. Basilisk in the pipes?”</p><p><br></p><p>“There is no harm in listening to what he has to say. It would take only a moment.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A Basilisk’s gaze kills. It doesn’t petrify.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Not if they don’t look at it directly. None of them looked at it directly. Hermione and Penelope looked at it through her mirror, Collin looked at it through a camera lens, that’s why the camera reels melted. Justin saw it through Nearly Headless Nick and Nick was already dead and Mr. Filch’s cat saw it through the puddle of water.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s quite an interesting theory, you there, Mr Potter. Now, why don’t you explain everything to me slowly.” Dumbledore asked and he looked towards others.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alone, Sir. I cannot speak about it in front of others.”</p><p><br></p><p>They were taken aback at his request.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mr. Potter, are you saying that you cannot trust us?” Professor Mcgonagall asked, surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>“Please, Sir. I cannot say it in front of others.” he insisted.</p><p><br></p><p>“You will speak whatever you have to speak in front of everyone.” Snape shouted, making him face him.</p><p><br></p><p>He remembered the instructions and looked down, not meeting his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Look at me.” he shouted.</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t and closed his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Serverus, unhand him, right now.” he heard Professor Mcgonagall’s voice.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let him go, Severus.” he heard Dumbledore’s voice and felt Snape letting go of him. “You can open your eyes, Harry. I don’t know where you learned it from but neither Serverus or anyone else will be doing what you are guarding from.”</p><p><br></p><p>He opened his eyes and looked in the direction of the voice.</p><p><br></p><p>Dumbledore leaned in and he whispered the word he was told into his ear.</p><p><br></p><p>The reaction was obvious.</p><p><br></p><p>He jolted back in surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>“Where did you learn of that word, Harry? Who told you that word?”</p><p><br></p><p>Even he was taken aback by the intensity of the question.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alone Sir.” he repeated again.</p><p><br></p><p>“Minerva, Severus. Please excuse us for a while. This matter… it’s for the best if it remains between the two of us.” he ordered.</p><p><br></p><p>They looked at him in surprise for a while but left nonetheless.</p><p><br></p><p>But on Dumbledore’s insistence, they left nonetheless.</p><p><br></p><p>Dumbledore waved his hand and all the portraits in the place were frozen.</p><p><br></p><p>“Now Harry, where did you hear that word?” He asked again.</p><p><br></p><p>“I… found a piece of paper in Hermione’s hand when she was petrified. There was a drawing of some kind, a circle and many runes. It called out to me asking what I wished for.”</p><p><br></p><p>Dumbledore’s face paled at the words.</p><p><br></p><p>“Where is that paper?” he asked immediately.</p><p><br></p><p>He brought the paper out of his pocket and showed it to him.</p><p><br></p><p>Dumbledore looked at the paper with a frown on his face. “How strange… I don’t recognise most of these runes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What then?”</p><p><br></p><p>“We have to wish for something while holding the paper.”</p><p><br></p><p>He held the paper and closed his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>And sure enough, a crack appeared in the air in front of them and formed a hole in the space.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hello again, Harry. What can I do for you this time? I hope you understand that I still haven’t received my payment from our previous deal.” The voice from the other end said.</p><p><br></p><p>Dumbledore stumbled back at the appearance of the Hole, bringing out his wand from his robes and pointing it towards the hole.</p><p><br></p><p>“What are you?” he asked, composing himself but not removing the point of his wand from the hole.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, where are my manners? I’m what you all know as a Devil.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Acelin -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I watched as their faces paled at my words but opening and closing the holes was my territory.</p><p><br></p><p>I was ready to dodge at any time in case he threw a spell but didn’t show it.</p><p><br></p><p>I acted quickly, not giving them a chance to do anything. “My name is Ace Belphegor. I guess you might have heard of my name or at least my last name.” I said, looking at the old man and observed his hand shake lightly at my last name.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t give him my real name because who knows what kind of shit they have in their world. I mean I knew there were tales of Demons being controlled by their real names. I didn’t know if such a thing would apply to me but I had no intention of testing that.</p><p><br></p><p>“I think you should speak faster if you wish to make a deal. I have a lot of other work to do, ya know? Not to mention that you don’t have enough time as it is. I wasn’t joking when I said lives were at stake.”</p><p><br></p><p>Dumbledore quickly came back to senses and pointed his wand at the paper.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure you want to do that? I really thought you would have liked to know the location of your favourite student’s Horcrux causing all this mess. But if that is your wish…” I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>He held his hand and looked at me incredulously.</p><p><br></p><p>“He didn’t… you must be lying.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the man with a deadpan. “Lying is something you humans specialise in, not us. We cannot lie during our deals. But sure, do as you wish. It’s not like lives being at stake ever bothered you in front of your own beliefs of always being right. Be it Lily and James Potter or… Ariana. But whatever may be the case, I want my payment for the information about the Basilisk first, or don’t blame me…” I left my words hanging.</p><p><br></p><p>Even if I don’t get any deals out of him, I will still get my thousand gold coins first.</p><p><br></p><p>That kind of money would get me a simple Magic Circle at the very least.</p><p><br></p><p>“What did you promise it, Harry?” He looked at the boy and asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“A… a thousand galleons, Sir.” He stuttered, still looking at me in shock.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am a He, thank you very much.” I added but none of them paid attention.</p><p><br></p><p>They were far too busy to put out their own fires.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at me and spoke. “You will get your thousand galleons.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Before the other deal and no later than two days, as per the promise.”</p><p><br></p><p>His face steeled but he nodded nonetheless.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, by the way… the one who is about to die has less than one day… so… good luck. PS. If you ever need to solve a problem with a Horcrux….which you <em>will</em>. Call me. Remember, ‘the power he knows not’… can be anything.”</p><p><br></p><p>I closed the hole without waiting for their reply.</p><p><br></p><p>Now it was the waiting game.</p><p><br></p><p>I would be getting a thousand galleons out of this for sure because no matter what Dumbledore might think, he will still pay the end of Harry’s deal.</p><p><br></p><p>Whether I can get more than it or not… depends on Voldermort.</p><p><br></p><p>It’s not like that’s the only place I can get a deal from.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>After he went to Dumbledore, I made sure to slip through several of my summoning contracts through the holes at different parts of Hogwarts.</p><p><br></p><p>One or another idiot will be summoning me for sure.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>For the next few hours, I thought about different possibilities.</p><p><br></p><p>Did this Hole Open in only my world?</p><p><br></p><p>Did that mean that my world was attached to the Harry Potter world?</p><p><br></p><p>Or could my holes reach into other worlds?</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t know the year in the Human World but it won’t be that hard to find. So, the first thing I did was run around to find this information.</p><p><br></p><p>What I found out was that, this was 1994.</p><p><br></p><p>So, that verified that this world was different from the one where my portal opened.</p><p><br></p><p>This opened so many possibilities.</p><p><br></p><p>But there were restrictions too.</p><p><br></p><p>First, I couldn’t pinpoint the worlds. The holes I opened were all at random.</p><p><br></p><p>The only reason I could pinpoint them was due to the summoning contract activated by Harry, which contained some of my power, thus acting as an anchor for me to latch onto.</p><p><br></p><p>The second was the size of the hole.</p><p><br></p><p>It was certainly bigger than the previous ones but it still took a lot of power. But now, I understand the reason behind it.</p><p><br></p><p>Those bastards would be crying tears of blood if they knew what they had thrown away… on second thought, that bastard was the sort of guy who would rather kill me out of envy if he found out about my power.</p><p><br></p><p>Whatever it may be, it was their loss.</p><p><br></p><p>The last restriction was the consumption of power to keep the door opened.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the main reasons why I ended my conversation with them so early was due to the power consumption from my side.</p><p><br></p><p>Even with my almost High Class power reserves, I was still having a hard time keeping the hole open for so long.</p><p><br></p><p>But the last two problems can be solved through training and time.</p><p><br></p><p>It was eight hours later that I sensed another summoning.</p><p><br></p><p>I took a deep breath before opening another portal while being wary of another attack.</p><p><br></p><p>As expected, it was Dumbledore.</p><p><br></p><p>His face was passive as he looked at me.</p><p><br></p><p>Behind him, stood Harry, scared.</p><p><br></p><p>First things first, he handed a pouch to Harry and nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy threw the pouch through the portal.</p><p><br></p><p>I picked it up, opened and overturned it and hundreds of golden coins poured out.</p><p><br></p><p>It was enough to fill up the ground of my small room.</p><p><br></p><p>That should be enough for now.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked up at the two. “Well, thank you Harry Potter. Our end of the deal is complete.” With just that, I sensed a wisp of power, a very tiny wisp which was almost negligible, entering my body and merging with myself. It was so small that it almost seemed as if it were a dream or illusion.</p><p><br></p><p>But I knew that the increase was real.</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled. “Now then, since you haven’t already shouted at me to get lost, I presume that you have another deal to make with me? Go on, I’m waiting.”</p><p><br></p><p>Dumbledore looked at Harry. “You may leave now Harry. Whatever happens now, I will be responsible for it solely.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But Headmaster…”</p><p><br></p><p>“I appreciate your concern but I will be fine, Harry.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my, it seems as if you are planning to walk to your death. Don’t worry. We don’t trade in souls anymore. It’s a bad currency. I prefer materialistic things to souls.”</p><p><br></p><p>They looked at me but didn’t say anything.</p><p><br></p><p>Harry left the room nonetheless.</p><p><br></p><p>“I wish to make a deal with you to know about the Horcrux Tom made. State your price.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh pretty direct. I like it. My price. Let me think. Books. I want books on Occlumency and Legilimency. All the knowledge you have on these two topics. Payment in two days or before the next deal.” I replied.</p><p><br></p><p>Occlumency involved controlling one’s emotions and helped increase focus. Such a thing helps increase focus and keep calm at times of combat as the user can just suppress emotions like anger or fear.</p><p><br></p><p>I had paused during my first fight and it could have been a matter of life and death.I don’t want such a thing to happen again. Not to mention, the increased focus will help me use devil magic better.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked taken aback but quickly collected himself and replied..</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay. Now my answer.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Tom Riddle’s Horcrux is in the Lestrange Vault at the Diagon Alley’s Gringotts Bank.” I answered. “It is Helga Hupplepuff’s cup. There, deal complete. ”</p><p><br></p><p>“What?!” But you said that someone’s life was in danger at Hogwarts because of the Horcrux.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Excuse me? I don’t recall ever saying such a thing. But yes, someone’s life is indeed in danger at Hogwarts because of Tom Riddle’s horcrux. It is just a different horcrux. What made you think he made only one?” I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“You twisted my words.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Your words were already twisted. Probably due to misassumptions on your part. However, that's not my problem but yours. You could always make another deal and term your question more properly.”</p><p><br></p><p>He gritted his teeth but took a deep breath to calm down.</p><p><br></p><p>“Another deal then. I wish to know of Tom Riddle’s horcrux inside Hogwarts which is a danger to the life of a student. State your price.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Phew. You are putting me through a lot of hard work here, Mr. Dumbledore. I hope you know that I’m a Devil of sloth. I mean my last name should tell you about it already. So, don’t mind if I charge more.”</p><p><br></p><p>“State your price.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm… Luck Potion or Felix Felicis. I want twenty vials of good quality Felix Felicis, each containing at least twelve hours worth of use at the very least.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s… too much. I cannot provide it within two days.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh you don’t have to give me everything within two days. You can always pay it in instalments. And as my interest, you can give me books again. All books from first year to seventh year of Hogwarts Curriculum on all subjects taught here. Fair, right? I mean I know it’s a bit high but can it be more than the life of a child?”</p><p><br></p><p>I know I was overcharging him but what can he do?</p><p><br></p><p>“A year. Alright. I accept.”</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled. “Alright then. The answer to your question is… Harry Potter. Harry Potter’s scar is the Horcrux.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man stumbled back in shock and looked at me with a stunned expression.</p><p><br></p><p>“No…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Although….that is also not the one which is of immediate danger to the student I was talking about. That’s a different Horcrux. But I had to answer your question. Teehee.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>I was prepared to dive aside at any moment to dodge an Avada Kedavra to my face but none came.</p><p><br></p><p>Dumbledore just looked down, face full of sadness.</p><p><br></p><p>“How many?” he whispered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you asking for a deal?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sigh… I wish to make another deal.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ohohohoho. I am on a roll today. If this were a video game, you would be getting an achievement for making the most amount of deals with a devil in the shortest period of time.”</p><p><br></p><p>He ignored my words. “I wish to know of all of Tom Marvolo Riddle’s Horcruxes. What will be the price?”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s… oh my. Not holding anything back, are we? Very well….the price will be….”</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I lay down on my bed, happy as I could be as I looked at the things in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>Loads of books, two vials of Luck Potion, five vials of Polyjuice Potion, an Invisibility Cloak, still good while not the Peverell Cloak, tons of gold coins, a couple magical trunks and the best thing of it all, the Elder Wand.</p><p><br></p><p>Oh poor Dumbledore is really a kind guy.</p><p><br></p><p>A kind guy who is often misguided by his own beliefs but a kind guy nonetheless.</p><p><br></p><p>I told him about every horcrux Voldemort made as well as their location for the Elder Wand and a ton of gold as well as Helena Rowenclaw’s Diadem which he is going to retrieve and I will remove Voldemort’s soul from it. Even I couldn’t believe that he gave up the Elder Wand.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t forget to leave another bait for him though.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirius Black’s innocence and removing Harry’s Horcrux.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy has too much knowledge and resources for me to waste.</p><p><br></p><p>Hell, I would gladly take most of the Black Fortune if I can get a deal with the convicted Black himself.</p><p><br></p><p>But for now, I’m satisfied.</p><p><br></p><p>The Elder Wand was disarmed from his hand by me when he brought it out so it did belong to me.</p><p><br></p><p>A focus.</p><p><br></p><p>With this alone, casting spells was much simpler than before.</p><p><br></p><p>I have a lot of work to do too.</p><p><br></p><p>With the sudden windfall and more to come in the coming days, I can buy at least a simple Magic Circle.</p><p><br></p><p>But till then, I needed to learn Occlumency and if possible, Legilimency too.</p><p><br></p><p>I also noticed that all three times, I received an increase in power from the deals.</p><p><br></p><p>It was like a drop in the ocean but it was still there.</p><p><br></p><p>This gave me hope.</p><p><br></p><p>One day… one day, I could get there too.</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>Two days later, I was summoned by Dumbledore again.</p><p><br></p><p>He offered me the Diadem under the condition that I do so in front of him.</p><p><br></p><p>I agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>I touched the Diadem and willed my magic to do the rest. It was almost an instinct.</p><p><br></p><p>I felt something inside the Diadem as my magic invaded the artifact, just like something ingrained in the DNA itself, I just knew what it was and how I could bring it out.</p><p><br></p><p>Using my Demonic Power, I grabbed the thing and pulled it out.</p><p><br></p><p>A shriek ran through the room as a face made of dark gas manifested in my hand.</p><p><br></p><p>Almost on instinct, I put the thing to my mouth and gulped it down.</p><p><br></p><p>Instantly, I felt a surge in power, far greater than the ones from the previous deals. It was not even comparable.</p><p><br></p><p>If one was a drop then the other was a cup full of water.</p><p><br></p><p>And this was just a small part of his full soul. His full soul would be even more.</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly shook my head, breaking out of the dangerous line of thought and looked at Dumbledore in front of me who had a look of horror on his face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Trust me, this was much better for him than what was waiting for him had I released him. His soul was incomplete and would have neither gone to heaven nor hell, nor would it stay in the world but remain stuck between the empty void of the worlds in darkness for all of eternity. That is the price for trying to cheat Death.”</p><p><br></p><p>He just kept silent and looked at me in fear.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well then, my work here is done. I expect my payment to be delivered on time. Have a good day, Albus Dumbledore.”</p><p><br></p><p>I closed the portal leaving the man alone.</p><p><br></p><p>I clenched my fist.</p><p><br></p><p>I now understood why many devils often decided to go rogue to trade in souls.</p><p><br></p><p>The feeling was almost addicting.</p><p><br></p><p>It was almost scary how one can lose oneself in it.</p><p><br></p><p>That was a dangerous road.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next two weeks, I drowned myself in the books Dumbledore had given me, starting from the Occlumency Books.</p><p><br></p><p>The reason why I insisted on the Diadem was because it was said to have some kind of effect on the brain of the user and increased the wisdom of the wearer.</p><p><br></p><p>I could see why.</p><p><br></p><p>My thoughts were far easier to control when I was wearing it. This helped me a lot in learning the basics of Occlumency.</p><p><br></p><p>Not only that, with the newly gained Elder Wand, I was practising the basics of Transfiguration and Charms as well.</p><p><br></p><p>The Wizarding World might not be high on the power totem pole but they certainly had convenient magic and while the Devil’s Imagination Magic could do almost all those things and much more, they had refined the art much more that even human wizards with very small amounts of magic could do magic with ease.</p><p><br></p><p>Apart from this, I got a map of the Underworld and made a detailed plan for selling my gold, a bit at different parts of the Underworld so that it cannot be tracked back to me.</p><p><br></p><p>My plan was to sell them over a period of time using the Polyjuice potion to avoid getting caught.</p><p><br></p><p>But first I needed to check if the Polyjuice Potion worked properly on Devils.</p><p><br></p><p>That was quite easy to do.</p><p><br></p><p>I stunned a Low Class Devil and forcibly fed him a bit of potion with a different person’s hair.</p><p><br></p><p>He did change and then revert back without any problems so the safety of the potion was verified.</p><p><br></p><p>There was another thing which I did routinely.</p><p><br></p><p>Opened portals and threw my Summoning Contracts in them whenever I could.</p><p><br></p><p>If I could get even one or two deals like the ones from Harry’s and Dumbledore’s it would be a jackpot.</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“Where did you find this, brat?” Dave asked while looking at the Elder Wand.</p><p><br></p><p>“I bought it from a magician who was selling off some old items for Liliums to buy some books. This does help focus my magic quite a bit.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It does. But wands are not suitable for Demonic Power. Human Magic is a lot calmer than Demonic Power, which is inherently volatile. I don’t know what was used to make this but it does conduct Demonic Power quite well, a surprise since most human wands and staff burn when using raw Demonic Power. What do you want to do with it?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I want a way to protect it. As you can see, it’s quite fragile and I am a sword user. There is a chance that it can break from a stray attack. I was wondering if you can do anything about it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, a wand would require the help of a runesmith. I could supplement it with some magical metal but the ratio could be messed up. I have worked with a few Runesmiths over the centuries so I will see what I can do. No promises though.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Meh… who’s doing it for your thanks? Bring me my booze.”</p><p><br></p><p>I laughed at his reply, already expecting something like that and brought out a few bottles from my bag.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm… these are more expensive than the last time.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I got some money since the last time we met.”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the bottles and then back at his forge.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t start running before you can walk or you will fall sooner or later.”</p><p><br></p><p>“…I will keep that in mind.”</p><p><br></p><p>We didn’t speak much after that. That was the thing with Dave. We didn’t need to talk with each other much but it still worked out between us. We had a good understanding.</p><p><br></p><p>I left his place late at night and walked towards my home.</p><p><br></p><p>It was during this time that I felt someone following me.</p><p><br></p><p>Crimes… were a commonplace thing in these outer towns.</p><p><br></p><p>Anyone who disappeared can just be thrown on the head of the pits.</p><p><br></p><p>But why are they following me?</p><p><br></p><p>So I decided to bait them.</p><p><br></p><p>All my valuables were in the expandable trunk which was shrunk into a locket to wear around my neck.</p><p><br></p><p>So no one will find anything around my home.</p><p><br></p><p>Even if I have to run away, I will be able to leave anytime I want.</p><p><br></p><p>But I needed to know who they were.</p><p><br></p><p>With this thought in mind, I walked towards the outer areas of the town.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a thick forest cover for miles before one reached the pits so there was enough place to hide.</p><p><br></p><p>I walked into the cover of the trees and quickly brought out the invisibility cloak and hid in the corner.</p><p><br></p><p>Sure enough a minute later, a group of four devils walked into the place.</p><p><br></p><p>“Where did he go?”</p><p><br></p><p>“We should have brought a sensor with us.’</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you even sure he has found something and it’s not just empty information?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The boy has been visiting the Magic shop a lot for the last two months. He even bought some books on Magic. He has been working as a carrier for a mid-sized hunting group and never even goes on big hunts… so, then, how did he get the money for it?”</p><p><br></p><p>So that’s why….</p><p><br></p><p>I was regularly visiting them to buy summoning contracts.</p><p><br></p><p>This attracted the attention of some people.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t hide myself just for buying summoning contracts because Polyjuice was quite limited for now so I was saving it for selling the gold later on.</p><p><br></p><p>To think it would lead to this….</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure that his hunting group wouldn’t come after us? We are just a small sized group. We cannot afford a fight with those bigger groups.” One of them asked and I paid more attention to their conversation.</p><p><br></p><p>“I only caught a hint of this because the clerk working in the shop is my brother. We are the only ones who know of this and it will need to stay that way once we get whatever the boy has out of him.”</p><p><br></p><p>The clerk…</p><p><br></p><p>But that did tell me a lot more than I wanted.</p><p><br></p><p>It meant… as long as these people died… things will stay here.</p><p><br></p><p>With this thought in mind, I slowly brought out my sword as well as the Ravenclaw Diadem which I wore as a ring and wore it on my head.</p><p><br></p><p>I felt my mind clear and my thoughts flow much better than before.</p><p><br></p><p>I had a clear view of them.</p><p><br></p><p>I took a slow and deep breath and focused on opening a hole directly behind the guy who was leading them.</p><p><br></p><p>And it all happened in a second.</p><p><br></p><p>With my Reinforcement at full power, I thrust my sword through the hole, directly piercing the chest of the guy.</p><p><br></p><p>The other three were shocked as the hole was hidden behind the guy and I pulled back the sword before closing the hole instantly.</p><p><br></p><p>“What!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Someone’s attacking.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Take positions.”</p><p><br></p><p>These guys were hunters for sure as they took positions with their backs to each other, with the first guy choking on his blood but in the middle of the group.</p><p><br></p><p>As they were looking around the place, I made my second move.</p><p><br></p><p>I hadn’t learned any attack magics yet so I needed to make do with the weaker ones first.</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Wingardium Leviosa</em>.”</p><p><br></p><p>I levitated a stick in the opposite direction from my own and let it fall.</p><p><br></p><p>The group turned in the direction and one of the guys started preparing for his spell while the other two faced the direction, taking position to face the attack from that direction.</p><p><br></p><p>I took the advantage of their misdirected attention and summoned another sword and attacked again, this time taking the head of the caster.</p><p><br></p><p>On my other hand was my wand.</p><p><br></p><p>“Lumos Maxima.” I cast my eyes closed.</p><p><br></p><p>The group turned back at sound only to be blinded by the high intensity light.</p><p><br></p><p>This was enough for me to make the last move.</p><p><br></p><p>I thrust my sword twice, taking down both the people with one attack on their heads each.</p><p><br></p><p>With the three done for and the last one struggling to stop his bleeding, I walked out from the bushes.</p><p><br></p><p>The leader of the group looked at me in shock and horror.</p><p><br></p><p>“N-no <em>cough</em> please… let me go.”</p><p><br></p><p>I just looked at him.</p><p><br></p><p>“I can give you money, magic. We have a lot of m-m- <em>cough</em> money. I p-promise I will n-not come after you please...”</p><p><br></p><p>“What is the name of the clerk?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ple-ase spare me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The name of the clerk and I let you go.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Grant <em>cough</em> <em>cough</em>.” He coughed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Who else knows?”</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>cough*</em> <em>cough</em>” He started coughing and breathing hard.</p><p><br></p><p>I would hope so, I made sure to attack his heart on the first strike.</p><p><br></p><p>“Who else did you tell about me?”</p><p><br></p><p>He was trying to answer but lost consciousness due to bloodloss.</p><p><br></p><p>What a waste.</p><p><br></p><p>No way was I carrying him out.</p><p><br></p><p>And this also left me with a lot of problems.</p><p><br></p><p>I still didn’t know who knew about me having money and what to do about this situation.</p><p><br></p><p>However, the first thing I did was search through their belongings.</p><p><br></p><p>They had weapons and even some one time usables like medicines useful for Devils, antidotes, etc. It also told me about the Hunting group they belonged to.</p><p><br></p><p>Demonic Hand.</p><p><br></p><p>I took all of the bits that couldn't be traced back to me and threw their bodies in the pits.</p><p><br></p><p>After that I went back to my home under the cover of the invisibility cloak and started to pack things up.</p><p><br></p><p>I needed to get ready to move out in case things went south.</p><p><br></p><p>But that doesn't mean I will just leave this place so easily.</p><p><br>At least not until there were people after my life here.</p><p><br></p><p>Grant.</p><p><br></p><p>I needed to remove the brother of that guy and his hunting group.</p><p><br></p><p>So, over the night, I thought of a plan.</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>The next day, I went about my usual chores.</p><p><br></p><p>I even followed my group into the pits to hunt and returned by the end of the day.</p><p><br></p><p>This continued for the next few days.</p><p><br></p><p>I did feel the stares of some people during this time but none of them approached me.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, I even felt someone had entered my home during my hunts so I made sure to not act suspicious at home, acting like a fourteen year old and hiding the money I had gotten from the hunts in a fake bag under the floorboards.</p><p><br></p><p>Just to keep up the pretence, I even went to the Magic Shop and bought Summoning Contracts again.</p><p><br></p><p>During this time, I found out who this Grant guy was.</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s when my plan started in earnest.</p><p><br></p><p>The next day, I went and hunted using my Invisibility Cloak and put all the dead bodies in the expandable trunk.</p><p><br></p><p>They were Low Class Demonic beasts at best so I could stack up many of them when using the Cloak.</p><p><br></p><p>I had already observed that they never followed me in the Pits.</p><p><br></p><p>When I returned from the hunt however, I sold only one of the beasts.</p><p><br></p><p>From the next day onwards, when I went to hunt, I entered the pits, used my Invisibility Cloak and returned back and kept an eye on Grant from a distance.</p><p><br></p><p>I observed his entire routine.</p><p><br></p><p>With this done, my preparation was completed.</p><p><br></p><p>So, when he went back home that day, I followed him and hid in his home.</p><p><br></p><p>When he went to sleep, I knocked him out and tied him up, throwing him in my trunk.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy was at the Mid Class level but we had stuff which can bind even Mid Class Demonic Beasts and restrict their Demonic Energy. I snatched some of his hair first.</p><p><br></p><p>When he was completely incapacitated, I woke him up.</p><p><br></p><p>The man was groggy from the sudden injury but he did recognise me when he woke up.</p><p><br></p><p>“You! So it was you.”</p><p><br></p><p>I smacked him on his face a few times with a mallet, not hard enough to kill him but certainly enough to break his face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Only I ask questions here… and you answer… truthfully. If this rule is broken anytime, I will kill you. Follow this rule and I will let you meet your brother.” I brought out the emblem of the Demonic Hand that his brother used to carry. The symbol of a group leader.</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t know who you are messing with. The people behind me… aghhhhh.”</p><p><br></p><p>I had already stabbed his thigh to shut him up.</p><p><br></p><p>Next I brought a vial of poison which could be used on weapons to kill Demonic Beasts.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have neither the time nor patience for your foolishness, so answer me. Why did you send your brother after me?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I didn’t…”</p><p><br></p><p>I poured the poison in the stab wound on his thigh.</p><p><br></p><p>The man paled immediately.</p><p><br></p><p>“I repeat, I’m in a hurry. And now you are the same. So, shall we get this game up to the pace? Answers.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I -I will answer. The antidote.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Will only be given when I am done with my questioning. No negotiations. Why did you send your brother after me?”</p><p><br></p><p>“W-we do this sometimes. The o-wner of the shop sends people to hunt for devils without any kind of backing and get back his magic books and artifacts so that he can sell them again. We divide the money.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p>Everyone of them… every single one of them is the same.</p><p><br></p><p>“Does the Marbas house know of this?”</p><p><br></p><p>“N-no. They don’t and wouldn’t care even if they did. We only target weaker Devils.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Son of a bitch.</p><p><br></p><p>“Who else knows of this?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Some people of the Demonic Hand and the owner. We don’t let the news spread or the Marbas house’s reputation will sink and they will kill us.”</p><p><br></p><p>I asked him a few more questions and then made him drink the antidote. I still needed him for something, but just to make sure, I even used some sedatives used against Demonic Beasts to keep him out. </p><p><br></p><p>With my targets clear, I made some quick changes to the plan.</p><p><br></p><p>Time was of the essence so I acted quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>I used his hair in the polyjuice potion and drank it. With the amount I had, I could keep up the disguise for a few hours.</p><p><br></p><p>Just enough for my plan.</p><p><br></p><p>I headed straight to the Magic Shop.</p><p><br></p><p>The owner was a Mid Class Devil working for the Marbas House.</p><p><br></p><p>“Grant? Why are you here so late?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I forgot something here.” I replied and went behind the counter.</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t pay any attention to me so I took this opportunity to fling one of the sedative bombs at his face.</p><p><br></p><p>He was not expecting this and was taken aback. I used this opportunity to stab him through the eye using a reinforced poisoned dagger I had picked up from my first attackers.</p><p><br></p><p>The man was able to put his hand in front of his eyes but I had used this same move to cleave through the Mid Class Demonic Beast’s heads, skulls and all.</p><p><br></p><p>His hand was pierced and then the dagger went through his eye, killing the man directly.</p><p><br>With the man down, I quickly got to work.</p><p><br></p><p>I hurried out and brought an enchanted trunk I had kept there. I could have kept it with me but then I would have needed to enlarge it and there were cameras in the shop.</p><p><br></p><p>I had already covered the trunks with a different kind of cover which didn’t bore any resemblance with my own trunks.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next ten minutes, I threw everything I could get my hands on from the shop and threw them into the trunk and ran out of the shop with the trunk.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact there were so many Magic Circles in front of me but I didn’t touch any of them in fear of getting tracked down.</p><p><br></p><p>There is going to be a catastrophe coming to this place soon enough and I didn’t want them to get any whiff of me.</p><p><br></p><p>I went directly to his home which had already been arranged to look as if he had packed things in a hurry and ran away.</p><p><br></p><p>Just to make things more credible, I threw one small bell type artifact in the corner of the room, under the table.</p><p><br></p><p>If they searched properly, they would find the artifact.</p><p><br></p><p>After that I went straight to the pits and buried the trunk deep into a hole near a place I had marked previously.</p><p><br></p><p>With everything done, I threw away all the clothes I had been wearing and burned them.</p><p><br></p><p>I had left Grant in the Pits as well and waited till he was attacked and killed by a Mid Class Demonic Beast.</p><p><br></p><p>Using this bait, I even hunted the beast.</p><p><br></p><p>The effect of the Polyjuice had worn off by then so I bought a Demonic Beast corpse and used its claws to make injuries on myself and left the pit.</p><p><br></p><p>Sure enough, by the time I was back, there was chaos in the whole town.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>Two months had passed since that incident.</p><p><br></p><p>The Marbas House had sent a High Class Devil with a dozen Mid Class Devils immediately to respond to the entire situation.</p><p><br></p><p>They had investigated and their search had led them to Grant and by an extension, his brother’s Demonic Hand.</p><p><br></p><p>Them going missing a while ago had actually worked against them in fact as they were all interrogated and they disappeared as well.</p><p><br></p><p>I was left completely alone in all this.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, it was horrifying to see a few small Hunting Groups get destroyed so easily.</p><p><br></p><p>No one even questioned anything in this territory.</p><p><br></p><p>Not only them, many others had died and mysteriously disappeared.</p><p><br></p><p>Were the lives of Low Class Devils so cheap?</p><p><br></p><p>I once again solidified my will to rise above these people.</p><p><br></p><p>I will not be helpless.</p><p><br></p><p>A few things have changed in the town since then.</p><p><br></p><p>Shops in the town had increased security while the prices had increased.</p><p><br></p><p>There were posters of Grant and the ones I had killed all over the town as well as in other territories with a reward on their heads.</p><p><br></p><p>Other Hunting groups were acting quiet too.</p><p><br></p><p>I had taken some time to heal up and recover in the meanwhile and practised Occlumency and my Clan Trait in my spare time and read the books on Magic and Rituals which I had gotten from the Magic Shop, the reason why those bastards came after me in the first place. They contained some methods of making one stronger.</p><p><br></p><p>Mostly sacrifices which were all banned now. There were a few methods but they were risky and vague.</p><p><br></p><p>Basically, this book was a massive waste.</p><p><br></p><p>Another book contained the list of identified Demonic Beasts and their uses as well as information about the Pits.</p><p><br></p><p>This one was far more useful.</p><p><br></p><p>The last book was on Charm and Hypnosis Magic for Devils which I found to be the most useful.</p><p><br></p><p>Apart from this, I was able to buy something to pass time and remember my last life.</p><p><br></p><p>A video game.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Since the rise in the number of Reincarnated Devils, the underworld was slowly accommodating their technologies.</p><p><br></p><p>Televisions and to some extent games are becoming common nowadays.</p><p><br></p><p>Dave had taken the wand to the Runesmith and had made a frame for it using a magical metal which conducted Demonic Power. This added to the overall durability of the wand.</p><p><br></p><p>Although I will have to pay off a debt for the metal for a while.</p><p><br></p><p>I had completed the plan where I could sell my gold off in a covert way. The only reason I was avoiding doing so was due to the Marbas incident.</p><p><br></p><p>But I couldn’t keep on avoiding this for long.</p><p><br></p><p>It was during such a time that I finally got another summoning.</p><p><br></p><p>Closing all the doors and windows of my house, I first wore the Ravenclaw’s Diadem and covered it under a hat and then responded to the summoning.</p><p><br></p><p>The one on the other end was a kid.</p><p><br></p><p>He had green, shoulder-length hair which was braided on the sides and green eyes. He wore clothes which wouldn’t be off on a noble kid.</p><p><br></p><p>Why do I always have kids summoning me?</p><p><br></p><p>“W-who are you?” he asked hesitantly. “We command you to answer us.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Command.</p><p><br></p><p>This brat?</p><p><br></p><p>But then again, I had no idea what kind of world this was so let’s find out.</p><p><br></p><p>“My name is Ace Belphegor. Who am I speaking to?” I asked politely, passively using my Charm Magic to ease the kid up to questioning.</p><p><br></p><p>“W-we are the Emperor of the Empire.”</p><p><br></p><p>….what?</p><p><br></p><p>That didn’t tell me anything.</p><p><br></p><p>I still helped back and enquired more.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, that sounds amazing. An Emperor at such a young age. You must be very talented.” I praised and the kid puffed up his chest in pride. “Pardon my ignorance. I’m not from your world so… would you tell me something more about your empire?”</p><p><br></p><p>“You are not from our world!” he asked, surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I am from a different world.” I brought out my wings for the kid to see.</p><p><br></p><p>“How amazing? Is that a Teigu?”</p><p><br></p><p>A Teigu?</p><p><br></p><p>That word brought some memories to the front of my mind and I looked at the kid in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>Teigu.</p><p><br></p><p>Emperor.</p><p><br></p><p>It couldn’t be.</p><p><br></p><p>Just to make sure I talked to him for a while and found out that he had just ascended to the throne.</p><p><br></p><p>The kid looked like he was seven or eight.</p><p><br></p><p>It was easy to get some things about the current world out of him.</p><p><br></p><p>The Empire hadn’t gone completely into hell yet.</p><p><br></p><p>I thought of what to do while I was talking to him.</p><p><br></p><p>For a good future contractor, it would be for the best if the Empire became stronger.</p><p><br></p><p>The kid himself wanted to do good for the country and it was only his naivety which fucked him over.</p><p><br></p><p>I had always felt bad for the kid whom no one actually tried to help.</p><p><br></p><p>Reminded me of my own situation.</p><p><br></p><p>But more than that, having the Emperor of a strong and united Empire as my contractor will be far more useful than anyone else I could think of.</p><p><br></p><p>So I conjured up a plan.</p><p><br></p><p>He was quite trusting of Honest.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t try to break his trust right now or it could push him away from me. What I needed first was to make him trust me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well to be honest Your Majesty, the paper you got was a contract which can be used to summon me. In my world, we need to make contracts to get promoted. For this, you can tell us your desire and we would try to fulfil it if it is possible for us for an appropriate cost though.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Our desires?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. For example if you want something to eat which you haven’t ever tasted before or something new which you haven’t seen, I can provide you with it for a suitable price.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ohhh Really? Can you show me something?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Why not? Here, have a try for free.”</p><p><br></p><p>I bought some chocolates from my bag and passed it to him.</p><p><br></p><p>The kid ate those without any kind of hesitation at all and his eyes lit up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Amazing! This is the best sweet we have ever eaten. Give us some more.” he shouted.</p><p><br></p><p>“As you wish, Your Majesty, but first, we need to discuss the terms of the deal.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Discuss?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I am very new to this so I have to follow some rules or I will be punished.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh. Very well. You have gifted us with the most delicious sweets we have ever eaten, we cannot let you be punished or it will tarnish the name of the Empire. State your rules.”</p><p><br></p><p>Oh he was such a nice kid.</p><p><br></p><p>The more I talked to him, the more bad I felt about his ending.</p><p><br></p><p>“First of all, you cannot tell anyone about our deals. Not even your closest friends or subordinates.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Very well.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Second, you can only summon me when you are alone.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm hmm.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Third, we will discuss the price of every deal before the exchange. As time goes on, I can trade better things with you but the prices will vary accordingly.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay, we understand.”</p><p><br></p><p>“In that case, I look forward to our prosperous future together, Your Majesty.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha we will look forward to it too.”</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Here’s another chapter of the ‘Ace in the Hole’.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>As I said earlier, this story will be a slow start and I will be making this similar to ‘Deal with the Devil’.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>But unlike Damien, Ace will have to struggle more to get to a higher level or even get his Evil Pieces.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I will try to write about his rise from the lower rungs of the society to higher levels all by his own effort and through a realistic progression.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sincerely hope you will like this story.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br></p>",

People who could destroy cities were numerous. Even a High Class being’s rampage can destroy a small mountain.</p><p><br></p><p>And that was not even mentioning the supposed invasion of Transformer Wannabes and Perverted Eldritch Gods who killed the so called Strongest Being of this world, the same being who was so strong that people of this world didn’t even put him in the Power Rankings as it was pointless.</p><p><br></p><p>I remember raging at the stupid plot more than several times in my last life. But now, imagining that my life rests in the hands of a braindead pervert who would trade his heart for a boob… yeah, I did contemplate giving that reincarnation wheel another go, more than a few times already.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean it would have been good if I was in a better position than I currently was but… looking around at the small, dilapidated room around me, I sighed.</p><p><br></p><p>Unlike the other transmigrators, I wasn’t born with a silver spoon aka OP family or a golden finger aka cheat skill.</p><p><br></p><p>Actually, I did.</p><p><br></p><p>But it only served to aggravate my situation.</p><p><br></p><p>I am Acelin Abaddon, the son of the third Ranked Rating Game player, Bedeze Abaddon and the nephew of Roygun Belphegor, the second Ranked Rating Game Player.</p><p><br></p><p>So then why was I in such a situation?</p><p><br></p><p>Well… there are several factors responsible for this.</p><p><br></p><p>The prime reason being that my dear father is a piece of shit.</p><p><br></p><p>What happened was that Bedeze, due to his pettiness at always losing to a woman, Roygun, did something to get one over her.</p><p><br></p><p>He seduced my dear mother, Mariane Belphegor, Roygun’s younger sister. My Aunt warned her about him but she was too lost in her so-called love and fell for his ploy. In doing so, she left the Clan and Bedeze was already kicked out of his clan when he decided to participate in the Rating Games.</p><p><br></p><p>The bastard didn’t just stop at this, he even used it to taunt Roygun and she in turn broke his limbs in the next Rating Game in front of the whole Underworld.</p><p><br></p><p>He was unfortunately healed with a Phenex Tears.</p><p><br></p><p>Damn chicken fuckers.</p><p><br></p><p>This caused the relations between the two sisters to plummet below Freezing Point.</p><p><br></p><p>The turning point was when I was born.</p><p><br></p><p>It turned out that I was born with a Mutated Clan Trait.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, many thought that it would be a good thing just because it was mutated but no… unfortunately, not all Mutations are good.</p><p><br></p><p>The Clan Trait of the Abaddon is Hole.</p><p><br>This technique allows the user to create and control portals that expand and retract according to the user's will and are able to absorb attacks and reflect them back as they choose. Once these holes have absorbed something in them, the user can reopen them in a different area of space nearby to release everything or even parts of what they've absorbed. </p><p><br></p><p>These spatial gaps work similar to black holes, in which they have a gravitational pull that redirects an attack away from their target; this pull is strong enough to completely absorb attacks or teleport to other locations and avoid attacks, or alternatively even teleport portions of the user's body and even their own attacks.</p><p><br></p><p>A versatile power.</p><p><br></p><p>The Belphegor Trait however was Crack.</p><p><br></p><p>It can create a Tear in anything with equal or lower power than the user.</p><p><br></p><p>Both of these are very good powers.</p><p><br></p><p>So if I was lucky, I would be born with both powers.</p><p><br></p><p>But it wasn’t so.</p><p><br></p><p>In my case, both the traits fused in a strange way which ruined the power of both sides.</p><p><br></p><p>I can create Holes but they cannot suck or store techniques. Instead, there is just a crack inside and that crack cannot do anything to other attacks.</p><p><br></p><p>The holes don’t even connect to each other which ultimately make the Skills a complete failure.</p><p><br></p><p>My clan traits fused in a way which made them completely useless.</p><p><br></p><p>Not to mention, the energy it takes to create them is so large that I could only create fingernail sized holes at the start whereas someone with even low class reserves could create several holes the size of a fist at the very least.</p><p><br></p><p>Ultimately, it was a complete waste.</p><p><br></p><p>And how could Bedeze stand this?</p><p><br></p><p>The guy hadn’t married my mother and refused to accept that the child was his, breaking off all relations.</p><p><br></p><p>My dear Mum went after him several times but to no use. She blamed me or rather the previous owner of the body.</p><p><br></p><p>I’m still not sure if I just regained my memories or was transmigrated.</p><p><br></p><p>She ultimately left me aside and decided to make a living.</p><p><br></p><p>Last I know, she died while trying to hunt near the pits.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>The last owner of the body was left alone at the age of eight and that’s when I entered.</p><p><br></p><p>So, here I was, in a small dingy room, a hot potato young devil with a defective Clan Trait who was on the shit list of two Ultimate Class devils.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t think many would envy my position.</p><p><br></p><p>I know I wouldn’t… especially knowing what was to come later on.</p><p><br></p><p>In this world, training was hard.</p><p><br></p><p>Training without any special help was even harder.</p><p><br></p><p>The resources lay in the hands of the top levels while Low Class Devils like me had to toil for decades to reach the levels which they can in teenage years.</p><p><br></p><p>I did have an advantage of being the child of two Extra Demon Clan’s devils which gave me better genes but even then, there was only so much I could do with brute force.</p><p><br></p><p>Some people would argue that I could train like Sairaorg but even Sairaorg was not a nobody.</p><p><br></p><p>Sure he was sent away by his father but he was still given enough resources as a member of the Bael house. Not to mention the Vapula.</p><p><br></p><p>I couldn’t even eat properly, so how could my body withstand the strain?</p><p><br></p><p>Then he got a Longinus to boot… and even then he was defeated by an idiot who had been a Devil for just a few months… because… Boobs.</p><p><br></p><p>What the fuck!?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Life was unfair.</p><p><br></p><p>In this world if someone was without a background or didn’t win the birth gacha for an Overpowered Sacred Gear, they probably wouldn’t make it large.</p><p><br></p><p>There were obviously exceptions but even they had to work for centuries.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t even know if I had that much time.</p><p><br></p><p>There were obviously other ways to get stronger.</p><p><br></p><p>We can always make contracts.</p><p><br></p><p>But even here, there was a catch for me.</p><p><br></p><p>As a Low Class Devil, a natural born Low Class Devil, I was not allowed to go to the Human World to make contracts.</p><p><br></p><p>I could only go there after I became a Middle Class Devil and that too for a short while. To really have easy access to the Human world, I needed to become a High Class Devil which would take a lot of time.</p><p><br></p><p>No one was going to take me in their peerages due to my background… not to mention, I don’t think I can trust anyone.</p><p><br></p><p>I doubt I would be able to rest my life in the hands of someone with just the knowledge of an anime from my previous life where boobs decided the future of the world.</p><p><br></p><p>It was easier for the ones with peerages to get promoted as they have certain facilities which normal Low Class Devils don’t.</p><p><br></p><p>First, they were allowed to go to the Human World with their kings which allowed them to make contracts easily and collect contribution points.</p><p><br></p><p>Second, they could participate in the Rating Games and Rank Up with the permission of their Kings and take a relatively easy exam.</p><p><br></p><p>Natural born devils don’t exactly need to join any peerages and can become a Middle Class Devil on their own.</p><p><br></p><p>There was however a catch. Any Low Class Devil would need the recommendation of a High Class or above Devil to be able to take the Middle Class Devil examination. </p><p><br></p><p> after they pass an examination held every decade for a limited number of seats for the promotion of Low Class Devils.</p><p><br></p><p>While this may seem fair, it hardly was so as hundreds of thousands of Low Class Devils exist and the seats for promotion were only a few hundreds positions for Middle Class seats. This was made harder by the fact that the examinations were extremely tough and each devil entering those were at the very least at the High Class Level in strength. Not to mention that other High Class Devils will only recommend their own servants and relatives making it nigh impossible for other normal Low Class Devils to get a recommendation.</p><p><br></p><p>Not that anyone would recommend me and piss off the Abaddon and Belphegor.</p><p><br></p><p>It was basically a scam which gave the Low Class Devils hope that they can also reach High Class Levels.</p><p><br></p><p>Moreover, Devils backed by Pillar Clans and other Top Tier Devil families have an unfair advantage in terms of resources such as magical knowledge and magic circles which acts as a means to properly channel their Demonic Power.</p><p><br></p><p>Without those, the efficiency of normal Devils to cast spells was 15% on average and 33% at best.</p><p><br></p><p>So the imagination based magic only goes so far as it becomes terribly inefficient without any magic circle.</p><p><br></p><p>To explain it in this way, with a magic circle, even Issei, someone who was stated to have lower Demonic Power than a newborn Devil child was able to cast Dress Break, which would have been a feat for normal Devils his age without a magic circle.</p><p><br></p><p>I know this because I was using the Abaddon Magic Circle when I was a kid and I had the memories of the previous user. Using normal magic was easy although my Trait didn’t help. But without a Magic Circle as I am now, it was hard. Far far harder.</p><p><br></p><p>I could barely use a basic water spell at half the power of what I could use when I was six years old.</p><p><br></p><p>Some might argue that one can still train their Physical abilities but that is also a dead end.</p><p><br></p><p>I know of devils who can rival Ultimate Class beings in terms of Physical Strength and were still Low Class Devils.</p><p><br></p><p>So, all in all, while a System did exist, it was broken beyond repair.</p><p><br></p><p>I shook my head off the thoughts and got up. I needed to prepare for the day.</p><p><br></p><p>I needed to work everyday to get food on my plate.</p><p><br></p><p>I walked out of my residence and towards the place I worked.</p><p><br></p><p>The town where I lived was on the outskirts of Devil Territory, a distance from a pit which is a place where demonic beasts spawned.</p><p><br></p><p>I preferred this place as it was somewhere where neither the enemies of my dear father, nor he himself could find me.</p><p><br></p><p>Here, I hid my identity and was known as Ace, the kid of two hunters who died while hunting in the pits and moved to this town to search for a living.</p><p><br></p><p>The Pit was both the boon and curse of this town.</p><p><br></p><p>On one hand, demonic beasts made the area around the town dangerous to live, on the other hand, it provided the town with its source of living.</p><p><br></p><p>The entire town dealt with the Demonic Beasts. Demonic Beast parts were harvested from the beasts which were hunted by the people of this place. They were then made into equipment. Demonic Beast meat was a food preferred by many High Class Devils. Obviously those are the meat of higher ranking beasts.</p><p><br></p><p>Hunting was a dangerous job and someone like me had no business going there.</p><p><br></p><p>But still, it was far better than other safer cities where Low Class Devils even with the strength of High Class ones had to toil in fields or tow boulders for a living.</p><p><br></p><p>At first, I did odd jobs in the town for over two years before landing a job at the local Blacksmith shop.</p><p><br></p><p>It provided me with a stable source of income as well as a place to train my body. Demonic Blacksmithing consisted of several methods of using Demonic Energy, thus improving control over it.</p><p><br></p><p>My plan was to slowly train myself to a decent level of strength and save up enough for a set of equipment and become a hunter.</p><p><br></p><p>It was the fastest way to make money.</p><p><br></p><p>The shop I worked at was a small one.</p><p><br></p><p>The Blacksmith, Mr. Dave was a gruff guy who spoke very few words but was very kindhearted.</p><p><br></p><p>He basically took me in at a time where I am sure I would have died if I was left alone.</p><p><br></p><p>For this alone, I owed this man more than I can repay him back for.</p><p><br></p><p>“I’m back, Mr. Dave.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. Clear the forge and prepare the Carcacide.” He replied, without even turning back from his place.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright.” I got to work.</p><p><br></p><p>Demonic Beast bones were far harder and resistant than steel or any other non magical metals.</p><p><br></p><p>The fuels used in the Underworld for crafting are different too.</p><p><br></p><p>Caracide is a magical ore which produces far more heat than normal materials but needs magic to operate with.</p><p><br></p><p>There are obviously higher grade ores as well as fuels.</p><p><br></p><p>I first cleaned the furnace and removed the leftovers.</p><p><br></p><p>Then came the harder work.</p><p><br>Preparing the Caracide required breaking it with a hammer made from the bones of a High Class Demonic Beasts. Using magic or Demonic Power to do so made it harder.</p><p><br></p><p>The hammer itself is extremely heavy to lift. The ones he uses for the forging process is heavier and yet, Dave still waves it around like it’s nobody’s business.</p><p><br></p><p>“Keep your arms in position and swing properly. Put your back into it.” He said as he put down a several feet tall bone beside the forge.</p><p><br></p><p>I corrected my position.</p><p><br></p><p>“Channel Demonic Power when your muscles are tired. It can heal devils to some extent.” He continued as he poured himself a drink</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes!” I shouted as I picked up the hammer and slammed it on the Caracide.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t reinforce yourself with Demonic Power. Let your body adapt.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes sir!”</p><p><br></p><p>I continued breaking the Caracide.</p><p><br></p><p>This was how we started our daily work.</p><p><br></p><p>I break enough caracide to last him an entire day.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, he even collected the Caracide from nearby shops and left them for me to break.</p><p><br></p><p>He did give me the money for it though but kept a part of it.</p><p><br></p><p>According to him, there was nothing free in this world.</p><p><br></p><p>If we want anything, we can only use our own hands to get it.</p><p><br></p><p>Our hard work is the only thing that will accompany us to the end.</p><p><br></p><p>His mouth got loose when he drank sometimes.</p><p><br></p><p>The man was old. Thousands of years old.</p><p><br></p><p>He is someone who had fought and survived in the Great War and had seen the age of Devils change over the time.</p><p><br></p><p>The two wars left him tired of all kinds of bloodshed and so when the Government changed, he retired and chose this kind of life.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I lay on the ground, trying to catch my breath, tired beyond comparison.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eat this.” Dave came out and sat down beside me. </p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the black piece of fried food.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is this?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s made from the Coagulated Blood of a High Class Demonic Beast’s heart.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But aren’t the Hearts of Demonic Beasts very expensive?” I asked, taking a bit into a surprisingly delicious snack.</p><p><br></p><p>“They are. Costs more than the entire Skeleton of some beasts. They do however bleed out the heart. A foolish thing to do. The lifeblood of a beast contains a lot of its demonic power. It helps to heal the body.” He explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then… why don’t they eat it too?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Because they find it too beneath them. Several fruits and vegetables have more nutrients in the skin than the vegetables themselves and yet… they get peeled and thrown aside. It’s a matter of if they can afford it. The heart will still contain more nutrients and Demonic Power, so why would they bother about something as lowly as this.” He dawdled and picked up a piece of the snack and took a bite. He had another bottle of alcohol in his other hand.</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing this, I knew that he was in one of his drunk moods so I decided to ask him more about this world.</p><p><br></p><p>The anime and light novels tell us almost nothing about the world itself. Especially about the Underworld.</p><p><br></p><p>I knew nothing about the history of this place, how things worked around here. How the people lived and how they functioned as a part of the society.</p><p><br></p><p>For such things, Dave was an excellent source of information.</p><p><br></p><p>As things progressed, I asked him about other things.</p><p><br></p><p>“Magic? Yes. Other races and Pantheons have different varieties of magic. Exorcists use Holy Magic by reciting the scriptures. The Heaven’s System collects the faith of the followers and powers those who have faith when they need it. They can channel this energy through different mediums. These people however consider any other form of magic to be heretical. A bunch of nutjobs, those bunch I tell you.”</p><p><br></p><p>I listened as he explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“At times, when we were allowed to go to the Human world on summonings, it would sometimes be the Church doing that, to catch a bunch of us and use us as training tools to teach their new trainees. Sometimes it was just for hunting us. Thus, the summoning ritual had to be changed to be intent based. It did change the numbers but it still existed. Later on, the Low Class Devils were stopped from going to the Human World until they were under the supervision of a High Class Devil or were at least a Middle Class Devil themselves to decrease the chances of this happening. The numbers of such cases were further reduced.”</p><p><br></p><p>I listened.</p><p><br></p><p>“So… not everything was done with bad intentions. It’s just that, some people had turned it into something it wasn’t supposed to be. You shouldn’t doubt everything.” He added at the end, making me shocked.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at him surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>“What? It’s obvious from your actions. I don’t know whose bastard child you are or what has happened to you in your past. Just make sure you don’t get hurt kid. I don’t want to lose such cheap labour…” He smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>My mind however was hovering with thoughts about how he knew.</p><p><br></p><p>“I told you previously, didn’t I? I used to be in the army. I fought in the Great War. Did you think I couldn’t see your growth? You are not Low Class Devils like us in blood. No. You are much like those nobles…”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am nothing like them.” I stopped him from continuing. “I will never be like them.”</p><p><br></p><p>\"Having so much hate in your heart will only cloud your judgement, boy. They don't care what happens to you so why are you wasting your life giving them free room in your mind and heart? The first step to grow is to give up these thoughts which burden you.\"</p><p><br></p><p>I became quiet. </p><p><br></p><p>It's not like I didn't know what he was talking about. I had all the memories of the kid before me and puberty with all the hormonal changes wasn't doing my temper any favours. I hated them even when I knew that what they did was to the previous owner of the body and not me. For all I know, I just regained my memories and it was me all along.</p><p><br></p><p>\"You are on your own, boy. So live for yourself. Why make your life entertainment for them? Why give them the satisfaction of seeing you struggle for their sake?\" He spoke.</p><p><br></p><p>I let out a sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>He was not wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why are you telling me all this?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked towards the moon in the sky and laid down on the ground. “Because you are still young and there is still time to fix this instead of letting it take root in your mind.”</p><p><br></p><p>“... I...”</p><p><br></p><p>“Just think about it.” He closed his eyes. “As for your plan for becoming a Hunter, give it a few more years and train. I still have the old books and training methods from my time in the Great War.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at him in surprise. “I could barely put them to use due to my minuscule demonic power reserves. Maybe, they will be better suited to you. It’s nothing much but it’s still enough to help you out as a hunter.”</p><p><br></p><p>“... thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Just work hard, kid. Believe me, you are not the unluckiest person in this world. There are those who have had it far worse.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>He got up after a few minutes. “Oh, and don’t you dare think I will be cutting off your workload. If anything, it will be increasing to compensate for my wasted time.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Sir!”</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>Dave began my training from the next day onwards.</p><p><br></p><p>A few hours after the day's work.</p><p><br></p><p>The first thing was the language.</p><p><br></p><p>I knew the basics of language but not enough.</p><p><br></p><p>Dave taught me enough to bring me to an acceptable level first.</p><p><br></p><p>While I was given one task everyday.</p><p><br></p><p>To exhaust my Demonic Power completely before I go to sleep.</p><p><br></p><p>Not even lower but completely empty my Demonic Power Reserves.</p><p><br></p><p>I could use any method but I needed to get it done.</p><p><br></p><p>At first I used to practise basic spells till I exhausted myself.</p><p><br></p><p>It wasn’t hard as my shit efficiency was a great help in doing so.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s where he guided me.</p><p><br></p><p>For Low Class Devils, the best method to use their demonic power was through reinforcement. Be it a weapon or their own body, reinforcement was the most energy efficient type of magic. It was extremely versatile.</p><p><br></p><p>Simple to learn and yet hard to master.</p><p><br></p><p>To train me, he set some challenges in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>Once I passed them, he would change the challenge and teach me a new trick.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, at first he would give me the work of crushing Caracide crystals in one hit.</p><p><br></p><p>When I could do so, he changed it with a different crystal.</p><p><br></p><p>I was trained how to use the basics of Reinforcement with this while also training my Demonic Power Reserves, Demonic Power Control, Stamina and concentration.</p><p><br></p><p>Then he changed it with a sword and the task was to do the same.</p><p><br></p><p>And then the task suddenly got worse.</p><p><br></p><p>I broke over a hundred swords in a week and Dave finally got fed up and stopped my training… only to teach me how to forge and mend a sword for the next month.</p><p><br></p><p>Since then if I ever broke a sword, I repaired it myself. I had to work for the cost though.</p><p><br></p><p>Took me five months to figure out how to do so.</p><p><br></p><p>His goal was to teach me how to use Reinforcement properly so as to damage the weapons the least.</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s when he changed the task again.</p><p><br></p><p>Cut the Caracide Crystals using my Reinforcement Magic.</p><p><br></p><p>This was to further refine my control and make the Demonic Power coating the sword sharper.</p><p><br></p><p>When even that was completed… he changed the sword with one which had a blunt edge and asked me to do the same.</p><p><br></p><p>Then he changed the material of my sword to make them weaker until I was doing so with a wooden sword.</p><p><br></p><p>It took a lot more Demonic Power but according to him, it would allow me to increase my control even more as these materials could simply crumble apart if the control was messed up even slightly.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Dave -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Two years.</p><p><br></p><p>It had been a full two years since he started training the boy.</p><p><br></p><p>And to say that he had shown improvement was an understatement.</p><p><br></p><p>He himself had needed to train for more than a few decades to master everything he had done in these two years.</p><p><br></p><p>Really, the top tier clans were something else.</p><p><br></p><p>He still remembered the day he had first met him.</p><p><br></p><p>A ten year old brat, barely wet behind his ears, was begging around for work.</p><p><br></p><p>He had taken pity on him and offered some bread but the boy wanted to work for it and stubbornly refused it.</p><p><br></p><p>To repay him for it, he stayed there and cleaned his shop the whole day.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy was quite smart and did a decent job so he allowed him to live in the shed.</p><p><br></p><p>And thus started a strange relationship.</p><p><br></p><p>He never complained no matter how hard the work was as long as there was a payment. He always completed the work without a word.</p><p><br></p><p>He stayed and worked there for the next two months and he observed that the boy was different from the normal Low Class Devils.</p><p><br></p><p>Probably the descendant of some extinct clan or a bastard child of some Pillars. They were rare but not unheard of.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next two years, he observed the boy and found out about his training and plans.</p><p><br></p><p>He had seen too many kids trying to be hunters and fail. Thus he offered some training to the kid, in an attempt to ensure he would be able to survive and maybe even give up his hatred.</p><p><br></p><p>Fighting against those Top Clans was nigh impossible.</p><p><br></p><p>He had lived tens of thousands of years to know that already.</p><p><br></p><p>But the kid had surpassed all his expectations.</p><p><br></p><p>His Demonic Power alone had grown tremendously over the years and was nearing High Class levels.</p><p><br></p><p>Although the lack of a proper Magic Circle would hold him back, his reinforcement magic alone would put him in the same league with most Mid Class Devils. If given a good magic circle, he would even reach High Class level in no time.</p><p><br></p><p>With this level of strength, he could last in the pits.</p><p><br></p><p>To be honest, he had lost his family in the Great War and the Civil War which led him to coming here and living his life in seclusion.</p><p><br></p><p>But over the past few years, he had found a semblance of a family in the boy.</p><p><br></p><p>And it made him hesitant to see him ready to leave for the Pits.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Acelin -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Two and a half years of training and I was finally ready for the job as a hunter.</p><p><br></p><p>And today was my last day over at Dave’s Workshop.</p><p><br></p><p>I walked into the place with a sad feeling.</p><p><br></p><p>This place had become a home to me and Dave had become a stubborn grandfather figure. I was a bit hesitant to leave but it was something I needed to do.</p><p><br></p><p>When I reached there, I saw that Dave was working as normal in front of the forge.</p><p><br></p><p>We didn’t speak about leaving and I worked normally the entire day.</p><p><br></p><p>It was when I was supposed to leave, I bowed to the man.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you for everything, Dave.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It was not for free. You still have to pay me for everything so make sure you don’t die, boy.” He snorted.</p><p><br></p><p>A smile came over my face at his tsundere-like reply.</p><p><br></p><p>“There, take that bag in the corner of the room and get out. I need to go out for drinks. Hurry up. Be off already.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the bag and picked it up before being pushed out by the guy who was very quick to close the door today. On opening the bag, I saw that there was a sword of my size, exactly like the one I had been using for training as well as a set of armour made from beast hide.</p><p><br></p><p>Really… this, he is such an old tsundere.</p><p><br></p><p>“I’ll be back.”</p><p><br></p><p>With that said, I left for my home.</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>Being a hunter was a dangerous job.</p><p><br></p><p>Thus, people who went to hunt in the pits made teams.</p><p><br></p><p>These teams could be anything from three to a hundred Devils.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, several bigger ones had their own offices where one could register and start at a lower level as carriers.</p><p><br></p><p>I had applied to a mid-sized group known as the Demonic Fang. It was a group of sixty devils who were quite well known throughout the city. I was given a position of a carrier to start with.</p><p><br></p><p>It was owned by a High Class Devil connected to the Amy Clan.</p><p><br></p><p>They mostly hunted Demonic Beasts of High Class Ranks and below.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact most of the big hunting groups were connected to some Pillar House in one way or the other. </p><p><br></p><p>Without such a connection, it was nigh impossible for them to get enough resources to compete for the top positions.</p><p><br></p><p>Demonic Fang had the lowest casualty rates among the hunting groups in this town. The main reason why I joined them.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Carry the bags and stay at the end of the group.\" The team leader commanded gruffly.</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded and followed them to my first hunt.</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>The pits were a scary place.</p><p><br></p><p>Now I know what Dave had meant when he said that I had to go there myself to know the difference.</p><p><br></p><p>The atmosphere itself had a sense of pressure on the people. It was filled with Demonic Power but there was a sense of wrongness in it.</p><p><br></p><p>The pressure made flying difficult, not to mention that aerial beasts would be able to detect us from a distance and it was hard to fight aerial battles with our equipment where we couldn’t use strong enough magic, whereas the trees protected us from those beasts.</p><p><br></p><p>Even teleportation was difficult in this place as the demonic power interfered with the spell and thus casting the spell needed time for those of our level.</p><p><br></p><p>This place gave the phrase, 'pits of hell' a new meaning.</p><p><br></p><p>The group had people good at sensing, who were searching for enemies so that we wouldn't get ambushed.</p><p><br></p><p>While the chances were low, sometimes stronger demonic beasts with intelligence came to the outer areas of the pit.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Five targets, 30° west.\" One of the sensors said and the group got into action.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Take formation.”</p><p><br></p><p>The whole group got into formation.</p><p><br></p><p>I too took my place at the tail of the group to prevent any ambushes from behind.</p><p><br></p><p>A few seconds later, the enemies appeared in front of us.</p><p><br></p><p>Wolves.</p><p><br></p><p>Each of them were above two metres high and the leader was around three.</p><p><br></p><p>They surrounded us first as the devils in the middle started to cast spells.</p><p><br></p><p>The first priority of such groups was to avoid damaging the beasts too much as damaged parts were sold for much less.</p><p><br></p><p>The spells were mainly to subdue the beast.</p><p><br></p><p>Even when using the weapons, they mainly used blunt weapons to avoid harming the fur.</p><p><br></p><p>In the meanwhile, the team had to hold back the beast.</p><p><br></p><p>The wolves jumped towards us as the ones at the front faced them head on.</p><p><br></p><p>The battle started in earnest and I watched my first real battle.</p><p><br></p><p>Dave had sparred with me sometimes but it was nothing like this.</p><p><br></p><p>Here, any slight mistake would take the heads of the ones in the front.</p><p><br></p><p>“Careful, three more targets incoming.” The sensors suddenly shouted.</p><p><br></p><p>The group tensed as the frontliners were full, one of the frontliners, the guy in front of me, slipped and tumbled back.</p><p><br></p><p>It was enough for the wolf to pounce on him.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy defended his head from being bitten off although his hand was bitten in the process. The devil between us jumped towards the side and left me open immediately.</p><p><br></p><p>I froze, all hair on the back of my neck rising, but it was only for a second.</p><p><br></p><p>Three other wolves entered and one of them pounced towards me.</p><p><br></p><p>I gripped my sword, pushed a large part of my Demonic Power into it and slashed with all my strength.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe it was because the wolf had underestimated my size but it hadn’t expected an attack of such power. All my experience with the Reinforcement Magic came forward as the wolf’s head was cleaved in two.</p><p><br></p><p>The blood from the wound splashed on my face.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t stop however and kneeled and stomped on the ground to push myself forward from under the first wolf and appeared right in front of the one who was attacking the frontliner and slashed.</p><p><br></p><p>The wolf looked in my direction at the last moment and backed away slightly but it wasn’t fast enough as my slash went through both its eyes and the front part of its face.</p><p><br></p><p>It howled.</p><p><br></p><p>My adrenaline rush was still on so I went forward and slashed my sword a third time.</p><p><br></p><p>This time the wolf was stunned by the previous attack and its neck was torn apart immediately and it fell to the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>The rest of the group gathered their wits and the spell casters had prepared their spells by then.</p><p><br></p><p>They cast a sleep spell on the whole group of wolves, several of them overlapping their attacks, causing the wolves to fall drowsy and fall down soon.</p><p><br></p><p>My adrenaline rush subsided and I fell down on my back, breathing heavily.</p><p><br></p><p>This was unlike anything I had felt yet.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I sat under the running water, trying to cool down while I tried to remember the hunt.</p><p><br></p><p>Now I understood what everyone meant when they said it’s not something which could be explained and one had to experience it for themselves to know.</p><p><br></p><p>Each moment was filled with danger. One stray attack, one misplaced step or one slip of attention and it was all over.</p><p><br></p><p>There was no second chance.</p><p><br></p><p>It was an eye opening experience.</p><p><br></p><p>Things could go from zero to infinity in just one moment.</p><p><br></p><p>The result of the fight was eight bodies of middle class Demonic Wolves.</p><p><br></p><p>I was given three times my share for my performance… which was still lower than any of the front line fighters.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, I was in a much safer place and this was still more than what I earned in two months as a blacksmith apprentice.</p><p><br></p><p>After taking a bath, I looked at myself in the mirror.</p><p><br></p><p>I had strawberry blonde hair and a decent height due to my training for the last few years. My facial features made me look more like a noble than any of the low class and middle class devils in these areas. I guess genes do help no matter which scum they come from.</p><p><br></p><p>With today’s income, I decided to buy something for my old mentor as well as take some time to do some maintenance on my sword.</p><p><br></p><p>And with that thought in mind, I left towards Dave’s workshop.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, you’re alive.” He looked back and said lazily before concentrating back on the forge.</p><p><br></p><p>I rolled my eyes at his comment.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I was lucky.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I would guess so.”</p><p><br></p><p>I went ahead and brought out a bottle of alcohol for him and kept it on the table at the side of the room.</p><p><br></p><p>“Just one bottle?” he said, not even looking back.</p><p><br></p><p>“For now.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright sit down. I guess I was expecting too much from a brat like you in the first place.”</p><p><br></p><p>I deadpanned at his comment. “I guess I should have brought more. At least you are honest when you’re drunk.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Che… as if stuff like this could get me drunk.” he finished the last touch up on the item he was working on and got up, washed his hands before coming beside me and picking up the bottle, opening and taking a sip.</p><p><br></p><p>“Carlson’s. They don’t make stuff like they did back in the day.” Although he said that, he didn’t stop.</p><p><br></p><p>“I wouldn’t know.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So, how was your first hunt?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It was…” I went ahead and explained everything to him.</p><p><br></p><p>“That was quite a mishap for your first hunt. Maybe I should have taken you to get blooded first before leaving you by yourself.”</p><p><br></p><p>I kept quiet.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t let this bout of luck get into your head. Hunt smaller beasts on the outskirts. Remember, always go at a beast one rank lower than you in terms of strength. Go for the same rank only when you are at least three times its number, more if they can use magic or poison. Actually, visit me after two days. I will prepare something for you to get you used to poisoning.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay.”</p><p><br></p><p>I did the maintenance on my sword while he drank in silence.</p><p><br></p><p>“You should give some time to your Clan Power if you have one.” he spoke after a period of silence.</p><p><br></p><p>My hands paused and I looked towards him and turning back to the sword in my hand, I let out a sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>Till now, he had never brought up my clan in all these years or the circumstance of my being there.</p><p><br></p><p>So, it was a bit of a surprise to see him bring up this topic. “My Clan Trait is useless in any combat.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh, not really. Maybe you just haven’t figured out how to use it yet. Every power has their own specialities. Even the ones we think are useless. Don’t give up on it. A Devil’s power comes from inside, from their desires, something which is perfectly suitable for them. It can never be useless, just of different use. Heard it from my commander during the Great War.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Your commander?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Belial. The original one. The man was a genius when it came to magic. His Clan Trait made him gather the knowledge of every kind of power to be able to disarm them. Should have seen him in a fight. All kinds of magic in front of him was….worthless. That’s where the Trait of the Belial House comes from. His understanding of any Magical Phenomenon was so great that he could always find a flaw in them and make them worthless. He was the one who brought up this theory and I do have to say that he was quite accurate.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the reflection of my face in the sword in my hand.</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay. I will see what I can do.”</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I left Dave’s place, my head full of thought.</p><p><br></p><p>I had given up on using my Clan Trait. In fact, I never used it in the last two and half years. In a way, it reminded me of the tag everyone had given me… defective.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t want to ruin my newly earned motivation for training through it.</p><p><br></p><p>As the saying goes, ‘Out of sight, out of mind’. </p><p><br></p><p>And, so I did my best to forget about it.</p><p><br></p><p>Before I realised, I was walking through the market and realised that I was at the front of a shop.</p><p><br></p><p>Magic Shop.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a shop which sold magical items for the general public, including Summoning Circles.</p><p><br></p><p>Sure, Low Class Devils were not allowed to go into the human world but… there were still other species which lived in the Underworld and some of them even lived in the Devil territories. And while devils were not allowed to make contracts with other devils, they could make contracts with other races.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is where the Summoning Contracts came into use.</p><p><br></p><p>They also sold one time Spell circles which could be used by just inputting magic into them.</p><p><br></p><p>Their best products however were the Magic Circles.</p><p><br></p><p>They sold Magic Circles  with upto 35% efficiency, the maximum amount of a Low Class Devil. That matched with the control of the user could push their efficiency from the average 33% to anything between 40-50%.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, these Circles cost an insane amount of money.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the lower versions cost a lot.</p><p><br></p><p>It would take me working for a century as a hunter to even dream of buying the 35% one.</p><p><br></p><p>There was however an advantage though.</p><p><br></p><p>Once someone gets it, they can pass it to their children. The top models can be passed around easily but there are cheaper ones where you just get the Magic Circle imprinted on you and so cannot pass them down.</p><p><br></p><p>They even sold some books on magic.</p><p><br></p><p>This establishment was under the Marbas House.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><em>Sigh</em></p><p><br></p><p>What was I even thinking?</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the bunch of paper in my hand.</p><p><br></p><p>Summoning Circles.</p><p><br></p><p>I shook my head and concentrated on the training for tonight.</p><p><br></p><p>First of all, I shut all the doors and windows of the house.</p><p><br></p><p>My house was already near the outskirts of the town so there wasn’t much chance of anyone seeing me practise but still, it’s better not to leave anything to chance.</p><p><br></p><p>With everything in place, I took a deep breath and faced an empty side of the room and summoned the Abaddon Hole.</p><p><br></p><p>A Palm sized hole appeared in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>Palm sized…</p><p><br></p><p>Even after my Demonic Power increased so much, it was still a fist sized hole. Not to mention, the hole seemed cracked.</p><p><br></p><p>It wasn’t even full anymore.</p><p><br></p><p>All that frustration from over the years came back at full force.</p><p><br></p><p>I clenched the thing near me and flung it at the hole. It took me a second to realise what I had thrown. The Summoning Contracts. Fucking dammit.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly I realised something, a few contracts were thrown in the hole and they never came out.</p><p><br></p><p>Where did they go?</p><p><br></p><p>To test it out, I summoned another hole and threw another crumpled Summoning Contract in it.</p><p><br></p><p>It went through.</p><p><br></p><p>Was it destroyed?</p><p><br></p><p>Did it go through? Was it connected to someplace?</p><p><br></p><p>I picked up a stick and poked the hole.</p><p><br></p><p>There was no resistance.</p><p><br></p><p>I pulled it back to see that there was no damage to the hole.</p><p><br></p><p>So it was connected to some place.</p><p><br></p><p>But where.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the night, I did several experiments.</p><p><br></p><p>I realised several differences between the normal Abaddon Hole and this one.</p><p><br></p><p>A normal Abaddon Hole was like a storage while this was like a window.</p><p><br></p><p>A normal one had a gravitational pull of its own, mine didn’t.</p><p><br></p><p>The third and the most important one.</p><p><br></p><p>A normal one’s interiors never changed but the ones I made always opened at a different place.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t dare look through the hole, fearing what might be on the other side.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe if I can get a camera or some kind of similar spell to investigate the interior, that might change.</p><p><br></p><p>But for now, I guess I will have to keep experimenting with it.</p><p><br></p><p>As I lay down on my bed, I remembered what Dave had said earlier today. ‘A trait is always suitable for the owner.’</p><p><br></p><p>What exactly did my power do?</p><p><br></p><p>For the first time in the last six years or so, I didn’t feel that my power was useless.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next month, I followed a steady routine.</p><p><br></p><p>Hunting every alternate day, mostly Low Class Demonic beasts to get a steady source of income.</p><p><br></p><p>Come back home and practise how to gain better control of my Clan Trait.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the course of this month, I gained a relatively fine control over the trait.</p><p><br></p><p>If nothing else, it could be used to throw attacks to a different place and although I couldn’t reflect them back at the user, this alone was still useful to a certain extent.</p><p><br></p><p>The greatest discovery however was that the Holes I created, while not an inventory, were more of a portal.</p><p><br></p><p>This meant, there was another end for the trait unlike the Abaddon Hole.</p><p><br></p><p>This also meant I could open a hole somewhere I wanted.</p><p><br></p><p>And with just that discovery, the whole Skill became an extremely useful one all of a sudden.</p><p><br></p><p>I wonder what they would have felt if they knew what I could do?</p><p><br></p><p>But all was not sunshine and butterflies all of a sudden.</p><p><br></p><p>Controlling the power was extremely hard.</p><p><br></p><p>I was still trying to open portals to a place where my eyes could see and only succeeded once every three times.</p><p><br></p><p>It was still helpful and opened up a lot of possibilities.</p><p><br></p><p>During a fight, I could open a portal near the weak spot of the enemy and directly stab my sword through it, finishing them off in one attack.</p><p><br></p><p>This was still not possible due to the amount of concentration needed for it without a magic circle. To do it in the middle of a fight while I was alone would be suicidal.</p><p><br></p><p>However, there was still a way to use it during an ambush.</p><p><br></p><p>If I hid in advance, I could open a portal behind the enemy and snipe them from my hiding place, which is exactly what I had been doing to hunt low class demonic beasts.</p><p><br></p><p>Thanks to this, I was able to save a bit of money in the last month. With this money, I bought the books needed for the Middle Class examinations.</p><p><br></p><p>It was expensive and I was only able to get a few but it was still a start.</p><p><br></p><p>I will reach there.</p><p><br></p><p>One step at a time.</p><p><br></p><p>With the rest of the money, I bought Summoning Circles and threw them in the Holes I created at random.</p><p><br></p><p>My theory was that these portals did open somewhere, which meant that the chances of them being inhabited by other beings was not a non-zero one.</p><p><br></p><p>If so then I could make contracts with them without going out of the Underworld.</p><p><br></p><p>And while I wouldn’t be able to put them on my record for promotion, it still increased my strength over the course of time as well as could provide me with a chance to get stuff from other places.</p><p><br></p><p>But there hasn’t been any answers till now.</p><p><br></p><p>I lay down on my bed after another day of hard work.</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s when something happened.</p><p><br></p><p>I felt a summoning.</p><p><br></p><p>A Summoning!</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>It was a very unique sensation.</p><p><br></p><p>The magic conveyed the call of the summoner to me, a connection through the magic I had put in the circle.</p><p><br></p><p>There had been several improvements to the new circles as now the Devils could select whether to reply to the summoning and if they did, then if they wanted to get summoned there or send someone else.</p><p><br></p><p>It was all done due to several reasons.</p><p><br></p><p>One was to improve the security so that ambushes were reduced.</p><p><br></p><p>Second was due to the Peerage System.</p><p><br></p><p>The King of the Peerage got the Summoning requests by default unless they gave their peerage members an explicit permission.</p><p><br></p><p>In this way, they could manage the activities and contracts of their peerages. This was done both to prevent their peerage members being drawn into a trap and to prevent them from doing any type of contract which the King didn’t provide or take any payment which was not allowed, like the souls.</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly got up and dressed up to make myself look presentable.</p><p><br></p><p>No way could I answer the Summoning, my first summoning in my pyjamas.</p><p><br></p><p>I chose not to teleport there because I didn’t know how to and I didn’t want to take the risk so… I chose to open the portal.</p><p><br></p><p>And to my surprise, opening the portal was much easier this time, even the crack was bigger and I could see the other side of the hole.</p><p><br></p><p>It took me a moment to realise why that happened.</p><p><br></p><p>The magic I had input inside the Summoning Circle was acting as an anchor for the hole from the other side.</p><p><br></p><p>Another new discovery.</p><p><br></p><p>On the other side, I could see a boy with glasses, wearing oversized clothes.</p><p><br></p><p>He seemed like a human but there was magic on him.</p><p><br></p><p>There was something else which I couldn’t just put a finger to.</p><p><br></p><p>“I-it really works.” he stumbled and fell on his back at my sight.</p><p><br></p><p>I decided to take this opportunity to pitch my sales.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why have you summoned me, human? What is it… that you desire?”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>The boy just kept looking at me wide eyed.</p><p><br></p><p>The hole was taking my magic continuously so I interrupted the shell shocked guy.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have better things to do than to stare at you, boy. Who are you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I-I -I am Harry Potter, Sir.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh!”</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>So I am back with a new story.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>It was an idea that was presented to me and I took a liking to it.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Made me realise that I had not written a story where the MC starts from the bottom.

I mean I knew they were close to Leon but I wasn’t expecting the guy to come himself. In hindsight, it could also be due to the fact that Kagali or Kazerim was the one he had killed or supposedly killed.</p><p><br></p><p>And then even Milim dropped by herself.</p><p><br></p><p>I guess I was still underestimating the extent of her anger at Jahil.</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, it was understandable.</p><p><br></p><p>This guy was not only responsible for killing her dragon but even releasing it again to fight against me.</p><p><br></p><p>Laplace was caught as well.</p><p><br></p><p>The operation on their side was a total success.</p><p><br></p><p>Now all that was left was to take care of the situation in front of us.</p><p><br></p><p>As I sat with the diplomats of different countries, joining me over dinner, I took a glance at Yuuki and then at Hinata. It was time to begin our plan.</p><p><br></p><p>On a slight signal from me, things started.</p><p><br></p><p>A maid serving us went outside and two minutes later, Ena came rushing in and whispered something to Hinata.</p><p><br></p><p>She took a look at Yuuki and then me, getting up and standing behind him, making everyone look at her strangely.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, Hinata-san? What can I do for you?”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at the rest of us. “Two hours ago, the Capital of Ingrassia was attacked by the Platinum Saber, Demon Lord Leon Cromwell.” Her announcement caused a commotion in the people almost instantly.</p><p><br></p><p>Yuuki’s eyes widened as he got up quickly but she blocked his way.</p><p><br></p><p>He narrowed his eyes. “What is the meaning of this, Hinata-san?”</p><p><br></p><p>She continued. “The purpose of Leon Cromwell attacking was due to the information that the vice leader of the Free Guild, Kagali, was actually the former Demon Lord, Kazerim, the same Demon Lord whom Leon Cromwell had defeated to win his current position as a Demon Lord.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What!” Several stunned cries echoed throughout the room.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am sure there was some kind of misunderstanding.” Yuuki tried to say but was stopped by her next sentence.</p><p><br></p><p>“This was also proved as not only her but several other Majin who were the servants of the former Demon Lord Kazerim tried to help her but were captured.” By then Ena had returned with her sword.</p><p><br></p><p>She drew her sword and pointed it towards him. “The Free Guild has been infiltrated to the top level and we have doubts that even the Guildmaster has been replaced; otherwise there is no way Yuuki Kagurazaka could have missed such an obvious blunder. Please cooperate with us in our investigation . If you are innocent, perhaps under some kind of control or even actually unaware of the situation, you will be freed. If however, you resist, I will be forced to subdue you.”</p><p><br></p><p>Others quickly got up as well.</p><p><br></p><p>As expected, the representatives of the Council of the West countries quickly started making noise, supporting Yuuki.</p><p><br></p><p>It was understandable, after all, their defences lay completely with the Free Guild. Once the guild, especially the guildmaster was changed, it would greatly affect them.</p><p><br></p><p>At this time, Hinata directly spoke. “I represent the Holy Empire Ruberious and its decision in this matter. This matter involves Demon Lords infiltrating the human territories. If anyone interferes with the investigation, they will be considered as collaborating with the Demon Lords and will be dealt with in a similar manner.”</p><p><br></p><p>A laugh was heard when she said this. “Oh my. This is quite sudden, isn’t it? And I suppose, we are supposed to believe your words just because you say so? I suppose the next thing you will say is that our kingdoms are infiltrated by Daemons and our families serve the Demon Lords and thus the Holy Empire Ruberious is taking over and we should just hand over everything, right?” The speaker was the girl I had seen before.</p><p><br></p><p>Mariabell Rosso.</p><p><br></p><p>Hinata narrowed her eyes and as if that was the case cue. Every one of the Council of the West members started creating a ruckus.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole situation only stopped when Gazel Dwargo stood up. “I think there is reason in Miss Hinata’s words. I can understand your reluctance but if there is even a slight chance that this matter is true, the ones who will face the greatest dangers will be your countries. This is not the first time Daemons have infiltrated or tried to take over kingdoms. There have been dozens of such cases. If someone in a position similar to Yuuki Kagurazaka were to get replaced by Daemons, we will be in great danger. Thus, this method needs to be investigated thoroughly.”</p><p><br></p><p>This made them all stop.</p><p><br></p><p>Gazel Dwargo was not a name people just dismissed, especially on this side of the world. This guy has ruled his kingdom for over three centuries, before which it was ruled by his father and grandfather. He is someone who has been an Incomplete Saint for centuries. So when he personally stood up, many people faltered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then what do you suggest we do? We cannot and will not leave him just for the Holy Empire Ruberious to investigate.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It doesn’t have to be that way. We can always keep him under custody till the whole matter is cleared.” The one who stood up this time was none other than the Homunculus of the Empress of the Sorcerer’s Dynasty Sarion. She added before anyone else could speak. “Just so that this matter remains impartial, I suggest we keep him under the custody of a neutral third party. As the accuser, the Holy Empire Ruberious can't guard him alone. The nations in the Council of the West cannot do it either, as they have the closest connection with him and might actually have his plants or associates among them. If there is even a hint of truth to the accusations, we cannot allow him to escape.”</p><p><br></p><p>The atmosphere became quiet.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a very reasonable explanation and no one could question the reasoning.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then who do you suggest should be the one to guard him?” Someone asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Right now, the best option should be His Majesty, King Salvatore.” Erald answered. “Not only is he a fellow Student of Yuuki Kagurazaka but also a True Hero, which means he is not a majin. He has no chance of being a plant or an associate of a Demon Lord. This also means he is perfectly neutral in this situation. Not to mention, he also has the strength to prevent him from running away. I vote for King Salvatore.”</p><p><br></p><p>There were several murmurs but also the people who agreed with the suggestions.</p><p><br></p><p>“I agree. I vote for King Salvatore as well.” Gazel Dwargo said.</p><p><br></p><p>The Empress nodded, followed by Fuze and then some other kings who had deeper relations with the dwarves and the elves, finally putting some pressure on the Council of the West.</p><p><br></p><p>At this point, even they knew that they could not deny or they would be called out for colluding with the Demon Lords and taken into custody as well.</p><p><br></p><p>They relented.</p><p><br></p><p>“Very well, but does King Salvatore agree with this?”</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone looked at me, even Yuuki and Hinata.</p><p><br></p><p>I took a look at them and finally my gaze fell over Yuuki.</p><p><br></p><p>“Until all the investigations are done, I will make sure he doesn’t go anywhere. I am sorry for this but you will have to cooperate with us.” As I said this, I looked towards Masaomi and Shiro and both of them quickly took positions behind them, in front of the door.</p><p><br></p><p>Yuuki smiled normally but there was a hint of anger in his eyes but he didn’t deny and raised his hands in surrender.</p><p><br></p><p>His hands were cuffed by the strongest handcuffs the dwarves could make and the elves could enchant. Even I used my Ultimate Skill, Uriel, to buff the cuffs so that they could bypass his Anti-Skill. Ironically, the enchantments used by the Elves were the same ones Jahil had used when he was possessing Kagali’s father to bypass Milim’s dragon’s Anti-Skill Skill. As expected, the moment the cuffs were put on his hands, his eyes widened and he snapped his head in my direction.</p><p><br></p><p>I just ordered looking stoic. “Take him out.”</p><p><br></p><p>Masaomi and Shiro did so quickly. Especially with Hinata lurking behind him as a shadow, he didn’t dare to make any moves.</p><p><br></p><p>“I guess that takes care of things. I will send people to investigate the truth about Yuuki Kagurazaka and the Free Guild being involved with a Demon Lord. I suggest we all do the same.” Gazel Dwargo said.</p><p><br></p><p>The Empress nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“In that case, I will even send some people from my side. Youm.” I called out.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, your Majesty.” He bowed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Please accompany them and investigate the veracity of the accusations. If Yuuki Kaguraza is indeed innocent, find out the person who spread the false rumours against him. I want the name. I will take care of everything else.”</p><p><br></p><p>I had to keep up the act to not alert anyone of the plans. I was, after all, a fellow student of Yuuki and someone who was quite close to him during my stay at the Free Guild Headquarters. This response should keep any suspicions at bay.</p><p><br></p><p>“By your order, your Majesty.” He bowed before leaving the room.</p><p><br></p><p>Others were also placated by this and left the room after a few more words.</p><p><br></p><p>“King Salvatore, may I talk with you for a minute?” The girl, Mariabell Rosso, asked me before leaving.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes?”</p><p><br></p><p>“In private.”</p><p><br></p><p>I raised an eyebrow before bringing her to a different room.</p><p><br></p><p>“I thank you for standing up for Yuuki, your Majesty.” She curtsied. “As you know, the Council of the West has invested a lot in supporting Yuuki Kagurazaka in the creation of the Free Guild, which has in turn given a lot of support to adventurers of many countries. I think we all can agree that damaging the reputation of the Free Guild will bring more harm than good to all the surrounding countries.” She explained.</p><p><br></p><p>That is indeed true.</p><p><br></p><p>Despite all the flaws in Yuuki, the Free Guild itself was not to blame and it was even necessary for the adventurers of this world.</p><p><br></p><p>From the start, none of us had any intention to disband it. Change its leadership, yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Destroy it, absolutely not.</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded at her words while thinking what she was coming at.</p><p><br></p><p>“Today’s incident, if proved correct, would question the entire base of the Free Guild and could even lead to its disbandment.” She continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am sure the Free Guild can recover in no time.” I reassured.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, but it will cause instability and a huge loss to the ones supported by the Free Guild.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That would be unfortunate but if there are demon lords involved, I am afraid this much is far better than to let them take root and then command over such a giant in the Western Nations.”</p><p><br></p><p>“True. I cannot even imagine how terrible such a thing would be. That is why….I wish to invite you to take on the mantle as the Guild Master of the Free Guild in the worst case scenario. Your identity as a Saint and a Hero, as well as a former member of the Guild, would reassure people and keep their confidence from straying away.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>What the fuck is wrong with people of this world?</p><p><br></p><p>“I am sorry but I just became a king of the country. There is a lot of work for me to do here. I can’t imagine myself in a position as busy as the Guild Master of the Free Guild.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh but it will be good for your Kingdom too. The Free Guild earns a lot through the commissions from its missions. Not only that but you can also command the thousands of adventurers of the Free Guild at your will. It will be a great support to both your economy and military.”</p><p><br></p><p>….what is she doing?</p><p><br></p><p>There is no way she is offering me all this, especially considering the fact that it was the Rosso Clan which put so much effort in Yuuki Kagurazaka and his guild.</p><p><br></p><p>I got the answer the very next second.</p><p><br></p><p><em>‘Mental Interference of the Unique Skill: Greed was detected.’</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>‘That bitch. Should I just kill her?’</em> A voice sounded in my head as Vritra spoke into my ears.</p><p><br></p><p><em>‘Eh? What happened there?’ </em>Rimuru’s voice sounded almost instantly.</p><p><br></p><p><em>‘Nothing. Just that bitch trying to mind control him into becoming her puppet. I was just about to kill her.’</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>‘Hold on. Don’t kill her.’</em> Rimuru said quickly.</p><p><br></p><p><em>‘What?</em>’ Vritra questioned, surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>Actually, even I was surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>This kind of thing was something I detested the most and knowing what I did about Rimuru, she would practically skin anyone who tried such a thing on me. So both Vritra and I were surprised when she said this.</p><p><br></p><p><em>‘Don’t kill her now. It would be a massive political blunder if she dies in Sal’s Kingdom and bring him shame. Just wait till she is out of the Kingdom. I will order Diablo to kidnap her and give her a taste of her own medicine. She wants to mind control my hubby. Bitch, I will skin her alive.’</em></p><p><br></p><p>….ah. So that’s it.</p><p><br></p><p><em>‘Kihihihi why didn’t I think of that? Yes. A slow and painful death would be much better than just snapping her neck.’</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>‘Let’s see what she’s after first.’</em></p><p><br></p><p>‘What does this skill do?’ I asked Solomon and got a small rundown on the analysis of the skill.</p><p><br></p><p>So she wants to incite my greed to control me through it.</p><p><br></p><p>Well, since she started this then I have no problem doing what I am going to do with her next.</p><p><br></p><p>I was an Ultimate Skill user so this kind of thing was actually useless against me. Still I pretended to be enamoured by the topic and noticed a barely concealed smirk.</p><p><br></p><p>“Your words are reasonable.” I said, pretending to think. “Okay, how about this. Shall we play a small game? If you win, I will do as you say and become the Guildmaster of the Free Guild.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! What game?” She asked, surprised at my proposal.</p><p><br></p><p>She was probably thinking that she had already controlled me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nothing. Just a game of tic-tac-toe.” I offered, drawing a knife and making the lines on the table before putting a circle on it and placing the knife there.</p><p><br></p><p>She raised an eyebrow but put a cross in an empty spot.</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled and purposely lost the game.</p><p><br></p><p>As expected and ordered inside my head.</p><p><br></p><p>‘Release the Leviathan.’</p><p><br></p><p>“It seems I lost this game. Good. I accept.” I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>The Ultimate Skill Leviathan was stimulated by the loss.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Leviathan was stimulated by the defeat and is trying to copy the Unique Skill: Greed.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Process Successful.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p>With a few more words and reassurances, I sent her away.</p><p><br></p><p>‘Now you two are free to do whatever you want with her.’</p><p><br></p><p><em>‘That was quite cunning of you, snagging her skill like that.’</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>‘It was one of the Sin Series Skill with the potential of becoming an Ultimate Skill. I would be a fool to waste it.’ </em>I answered.</p><p><br></p><p><em>‘I didn’t realise we could do that. Greed does seem like a good skill.’</em> Rimuru said before coming back to the next topic. <em>‘What about Yuuki? What do we do about him?’</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>‘What? We take him out. I am not taking any risks with that kind of guy. As soon as the news becomes public that Kagali was the former Demon Lord Kazerim, Yuuki needs to go.’</em></p><p><br></p><p>I really wasn’t planning to let that guy go free.</p><p><br></p><p>He was too dangerous to be left alone.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, if it had been all in my hands, I would have killed him the moment he was in those cuffs.</p><p><br></p><p>Even now, Masaomi, Shiro and Hinata were watching him continuously to prevent him from escaping and that was only in the open.</p><p><br></p><p>Behind the scenes, Rimuru, Veldora, Cleria and Aletia were watching him. Not to mention he was locked in the deepest floor of Ramiris’ Labyrinth, something which even I couldn’t break all at once right now. To top it off, I even had Rin occupy a fake cell in disguise </p><p><br></p><p>And all this was planned personally by me. At this point, Rimuru had been doubtful if I was overdoing it. But then again, this guy was the literal final enemy in the webnovel version so I doubt it.</p><p><br></p><p>Although this world was a weird mix of all the source materials, I couldn’t risk taking any guesses.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Kagali -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She stared at the group of people surrounding her.</p><p><br></p><p>Any hope she had to flee were wiped out the moment the Destroyer had entered the fray.</p><p><br></p><p>Even now she couldn’t understand how things came to this?</p><p><br></p><p>The presence of the people in the room were making her feel suffocated, especially Leon Cromwell, who was staring at her with that blank look on his face.</p><p><br></p><p>He hadn’t done or even said anything since she was captured which meant he wasn’t planning to kill her or at least kill her immediately. But what exactly were they planning?</p><p><br></p><p>The more she thought of it, the more tense she grew.</p><p><br></p><p>The room where she was kept was under so many enchantments that even Awakened Demon Lords would die if they tried to run….and that was assuming they could get out of these bindings.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, after what seemed to be years, the door of the room opened and in came two figures she had never expected to come.</p><p><br></p><p>Elmesia El Ru Sarion, the Empress of the Sorcerer Nation of Sarion and Sylvia El Ru….the True Ancestor of the Elven Race.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hello Kagali.” The older of the two spoke. “You have grown since I last saw you in Klaus’ hands. I believe you were just a couple years old back then.”</p><p><br></p><p>Her eyes widened at those words. How did they….</p><p><br></p><p>“How did I know? I know you have a lot of questions for us and I am here to answer everything you want to know….but for that you will have to be patient and be willing to listen to a story.”</p><p><br></p><p>She just stared at the woman without any words.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will take it as a yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>What came next was not something she was expecting.</p><p><br></p><p>The story, the past, <a href=\"https://everything….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">everything….it</a> turned the entire world view she had on its head.</p><p><br></p><p>“You….are lying.” She uttered, first in shock and then her voice gained confidence….or perhaps she was just stubbornly sticking to what she thought was her reality as she repeated. “It’s not real. You are all lying! Lying!”</p><p><br></p><p>They just stared at her and their eyes full of pity hurt even more than any of Leon’s attacks had done before this.</p><p><br></p><p>She kept on shouting and denying their words but they just stood there silently before Sylvia knelt in front of her and hugged her.</p><p><br></p><p>She stilled.</p><p><br></p><p>“I know you are in pain….pain that I can’t even claim to imagine but please get a hold of yourself. You are stronger than this.”</p><p><br></p><p>The words broke something inside her and she broke down into tears.</p><p><br></p><p>All that pain, all that suffering, she thought her father had hated her. She thought she had done something wrong. Some part of her had blamed herself for the state of her people but….</p><p><br></p><p>It was as if all the pain she had suffered had turned into tears and were pouring out of her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>The older woman kept caressing her back until she quieted down.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally after who knows how much time, she stopped and Sylvia pulled back.</p><p><br></p><p>Her helplessness, sorrow and pain slowly changed into anger and hate. “You said that….Jahil….was alive. Where is he?” She gritted through her teeth.</p><p><br></p><p>“Inside the body of your Deathman, Footman.” The Empress replied, making her freeze.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s impossible!” She replied almost instantly.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s occupying Footman’s body along with the original soul. Why do you think Milim Nava of all people would interfere in the matter? It was implanted there to spy on Clayman and you. In fact, even Clayman was actually under control of the Eastern Empire in his last days. His job was to weaken the Jura Forest and the surrounding countries to make them ripe for taking when the Eastern Empire attacked. Too bad, that fool made the exact same mistake as Jahil. He tried to control Milim Nava and then released her sealed dragon.”</p><p><br></p><p>She lowered her head at the information.</p><p><br></p><p>Elmesia continued. “If it’s any compensation to you, we can try to revive your servants and create new bodies for them after Jahil is taken care of.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I want to do it.” She whispered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I want to be the one to kill that bastard.” She gritted through her teeth.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am afraid too many people want to do the same, my child. I promise you that you can be there when he dies. Beyond this, I am afraid, is out of my hands already. The people that the fool has offended are beyond powerful and everyone is out for his blood.”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded, her anger ebbing a little bit at the reply.</p><p><br></p><p>“Your former kingdom, the Puppet nation of Jistav was given to King Salvatore but he has offered to return it back to you.”</p><p><br></p><p>Salvatore….</p><p><br></p><p>She looked up at the ancestor.</p><p><br></p><p>“It was King Salvatore who informed us about the whole thing which led to the capture of Jahil.”</p><p><br></p><p>The woman probably noticed the shocked look on her face and sighed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you think that person is someone you and Yuuki Kagurazaka could control? Even I wouldn’t dare to think about it. Actually, anyone who had even an inkling of his true identity wouldn’t dare to think or ever blemish the name of that person.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Mother?” The Empress was also as confused as her and looked at the ancestor.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sigh….I said more than I should have. Let’s forget it for now. Just understand this. King Salvatore is someone who is giving you a new chance at life as well as your revenge against the one who ruined your life….him, the person whom you tried to make into a puppet, had attacked, almost cost him his and his student, Chloe O’ Bell’s life….that same person not only forgave you, but also gave you a chance to start your life again, without any regrets. You would do well to remember it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What did you say?” The one who asked the question was not her….but surprisingly, Leon Cromwell of all people.</p><p><br></p><p>They looked at the man.</p><p><br></p><p>“Kagali and Yuuki Kagurazaka had sent an army and Charybdis after King Salvatore while he was taking his student to make a contract with the spirits at Lady Ramiris’ place. The girl was in a critical condition due to having been summoned at a young age and could die if not for the young King to run all the way to the Dwelling of the Spirits, fighting everyone in the way and finally helping her make a contract with a spirit and stabilising her.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man looked pale all of a sudden.</p><p><br></p><p>Was he a friend of Salvatore?</p><p><br></p><p>“The girl’s name….what did you say her name was?” He looked directly at her and asked.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at him weirdly but answered nonetheless. “Chloe O’ Bell.”</p><p><br></p><p>His eyes widened. “What did she look like?” He asked quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>She suddenly remembered that it was Leon who had made a deal with Yuuki to help him summon the children for some reason.</p><p><br></p><p>Was it?</p><p><br></p><p>While she was thinking this, the man had stepped directly in front of her, catching a hold of her shoulders. “What did she look like?” He shouted, surprising everyone in the room.</p><p><br></p><p>“B-black hair. Blue eyes. She was around 10 years old when she was summoned.” She conjured an image of her, making the man freeze in his place.</p><p><br></p><p>He took a deep breath and got up and without any word, drew his sword, ready to strike her down.</p><p><br></p><p>She paled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Leon! What are you doing?” Elmensia stood in front of her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Please move aside, Your Majesty. I have no enmity with you.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sylvia was also taken aback by his sudden change in attitude.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is the matter Leon?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am just doing what I should. Please step aside.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And may I ask why you are doing this?”</p><p><br></p><p>Leon glared at her over the shoulder of the Empress.</p><p><br></p><p>“This woman endangered the life of my sister and almost got her killed. Is this not a good enough reason?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Your sister?!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Chloe O’ Bell is my childhood friend and like a sister to me. She is the person I have been trying to summon all this time.” He replied, suddenly clearing the situation and making her realise how utterly she had messed up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Leon….I know you are angry but please reconsider this. Even the girl Chloe, forgave her. It was only after that that King Salvatore also let go of his grudge and even offered her Kingdom back to her. If you kill her, you will be going against her wishes.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man paused for a moment and Sylvia quickly added.</p><p><br></p><p>“At least wait till you meet her again and have a talk with her. Everyone here has been through a lot and after a long time, we all have found a point where we can go back to our happy lives. Please, don’t ruin it.” Sylvia urged.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Kagali quickly added. “I….didn’t hurt or even intend to hurt her. I was just planning to force Salvatore to join us and blackmail him for it. I….am….I am sorry.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man kept on glaring at her with intensity strong enough to set her on fire for a whole minute before taking a deep breath and sheathing his sword back and walking out of the room and only when the sound of his footsteps were gone did she breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p><br></p><p>It was only now that she had realised that all this time, Leon was just playing with her and wasn’t even attacking her seriously. It was only now that he was actually intending to kill her and that thought poured a cold rain on her.</p><p><br></p><p>She hadn’t realised just how strong these people were even after all this time. With this kind of strength, she doubted that even Yuuki would be a match for him.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Damrada -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Yuuki Kagurazaka was captured?” He asked, surprised at the sudden news.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes sir. He was suspected to be colluding with former Demon Lord Kazalim. His assistant, the elf, was the Demon Lord who had been using that form to hide beside him. Demon Lord Leon found out about it and attacked Ingrassia due to their previous altercation and revealed everything publicly. Yuuki Kagurazaka was visiting Camelot to attend the coronation ceremony of the newly ascended king Salvatore.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Who captured him?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hero Hinata was the one who accused him and after the interference of Gazel Dwargo and Elmensia El Ru Sarion, he was taken into custody. He is currently held by King Salvatore in Camelot till the investigations are completed.”</p><p><br></p><p>He narrowed his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Everything seemed reasonable but his instincts were telling him that things were not that simple.</p><p><br></p><p>He knew for sure that Yuuki was actually involved with Clayman and considering the relation between Kazilim and Clayman, it was not out of the possibility that Yuuki was indeed involved with them. But the question is….how did Leon Cromwell find out about it? And how did Hinata get wind of it so quickly before Yuuki? All of this was very convenient. And if that was really the case, he was afraid that Yuuki wouldn’t be alive for very long. He had invested a lot in the boy. His Anti-Skill was something which he had high hopes for, as someone who would be able to kill the Emperor in case he ever went out of control</p><p><br></p><p>Thinking about all these things, he quickly ordered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Gather a small team. Contact the Empire and ask for assistance. We will be breaking in and freeing Yuuki from the Camelot prison.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Should I ask Bernie and Jiwu?”</p><p><br></p><p>He thought for a moment and shook his head. “No. Keep them assigned to Masayuki’s protection. I will contact Granbell.” The former student of the Emperor had a lot of reach in this part of the world. Getting some reinforcement wouldn’t be hard for him.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next hour, he ordered the Cerberus organisation and made plans to create distractions all over the empire to take away their attention from Yuuki’s guard.</p><p><br></p><p>Camelot was a new kingdom and the previous Falmuth Kingdom had lost a very big battle, leaving it lacking in military and security departments. This weakness was going to come in handy when freeing Yuuki.</p><p><br></p><p>The biggest obstacles were going to be Hinata and Salvatore.</p><p><br></p><p>He had heard that the boy had become a Hero, most likely obtaining a Hero’s Egg after gaining the Blessing of an Elemental of Light. But there were also rumours about him giving up this blessing and becoming a majin to fight off Veldora.</p><p><br></p><p>He had serious doubts about this news. Even the weakest of the True Dragons was not something normal Majin could fight. That said, he was a Saint….so maybe he had some sort of skill which helped him gain the upper hand or that Veldora was not at full strength or maybe due to the intervention of Rimuru Tempest?</p><p><br></p><p>She did seem like the sort to engage in diplomacy.</p><p><br></p><p>Whatever the case was, he doubted Salvatore and Hinata alone could stop such a force.</p><p><br></p><p>Too bad that such a move would ruin their years of work but that was already ruined when Yuuki got caught in this whole mess.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Rimuru -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Did you find them?” She asked Shouei.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Rimuru-sama. They are leaving the borders of Camelot and entering Ingrassia.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Let them enter and pass through a few towns before taking them down.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Rimuru-sama. We were able to overhear some of their plans though.” Shouei said, attracting her attention.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“They are planning to infiltrate Camelot and free Yuuki Kagurazaka and in turn ruin the reputation of King Salvatore. They think he is a majin like Leon Cromwell who retains the power of a hero.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>Majin?</p><p><br></p><p>Oh….were these fools mistaking his Dragonoid nature for a Majin transformation?</p><p><br></p><p>That’s hilarious.</p><p><br></p><p>During the entire meeting, they had discovered that not many people knew that Salvatore was an Awakened Hero but rather a Hero’s Egg like Hinata.</p><p><br></p><p>But still, infiltrating Camelot huh….</p><p><br></p><p>She thought of something and ordered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let them go and keep a watch.. We will use their attack on Camelot to catch them red handed and expose them as cohorts of Yuuki. Even if they deny the accusations, it would be enough to torture some information out of the attackers. Just make sure you implant the bug in her before letting them go.”</p><p><br></p><p>She had reverse engineered the bug which Yuuki had implanted inside Salvatore and Hinata.</p><p><br></p><p>It had its uses after all.</p><p><br></p><p>And Mariabell Rosso, that reincarnated bitch was going to be the first test subject of the bugs.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Rimuru-sama.” Shouei replied and left.</p><p><br></p><p>With him gone, she laid back in her bed and relaxed.</p><p><br></p><p>Dwargo, Sarion and Ruberious had declared acceptance of the Monster Nation of Tempest as a legitimate country and wanted to start trade.</p><p><br></p><p>Following this, even Sal was going to sign a peace treaty between them and they can finally start cooperating together in public as well as declare a formal alliance in front of the world.</p><p><br></p><p>“So what is going to be our next plan?” She asked through her mental link.</p><p><br></p><p>“Find more people and strengthen our army. Rudra is going to attack in the near future and we need to prepare for it.” Sal replied almost immediately.</p><p><br></p><p>“We need funds for that. Economy needs to be able to keep up with the requirements of the army too.” She argued. “You shouldn’t have returned Jistav to Kagali.” She sighed.</p><p><br></p><p>“It wasn’t due to the goodness of my heart that I did so. First, the people of that place still worship the ground she walks on. Second, she would be our steadfast ally after this. Third, Jistav is the country directly bordering the Eastern Empire. We are not ready to take a direct assault from them but Kagali knows the entire ins and outs of the Kingdom and can defend better. Lastly, there is no way she is going to cooperate with the Eastern Empire, especially after knowing that they were behind the whole incident with Clayman.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm….sounds reasonable….and she has a nice ass too.” Vritra added.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Well….she did….and she is an elf.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright it’s decided. Sal, you will bang her into submission.”</p><p><br></p><p>“....what kind of hentai villain do you think I am?” He replied in a deadpan.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are something even greater, a harem protagonist. Most of them don’t even need to bang girls to make them submit.” She argued.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“See you agree.” She smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Next topic.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What about the part where we find more suitable people? Any progress on that?” He asked, quickly changing the subject.</p><p><br></p><p>Ah, so sweet. She loved it when he was being shy.</p><p><br></p><p>Vritra’s giggle in the background made the whole scene even better.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have sent people to search for potential recruits and will even go out to get some of them myself. For example the beetle and the bee you were telling me about. There was some information from Kurumi, the fox we rescued from Clayman’s control. Her tribe was killed by the Eastern Empire but she still knew some people who could join our side. What about your side?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am collaborating with my fellow teachers back at the Free Guild to tell me about any otherworlders from their otherworlder support program or potential adventurers who would like to join Camelot. Apart from that Irisviel is searching for more recruits while Shiro, Masaomi and Rin train them. By the way, I got information that the girl Mai Furuki has joined the Free Guild recently. I am going to have someone pick her up.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh. The girl with the Unique Skill: Traveller. Yeah, I can see how she will be necessary. Good. By the way, I have a suggestion.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“You should go around and copy the skills of everyone in your Kingdom, especially those like Dino and his subordinates whose loyalty we are not sure about. Maybe with more skills, we can try evolving our current skills into stronger versions.”</p><p><br></p><p>“....alright, I will.”</p><p><br></p><p>She then went on to tell them about Mariabell’s plans and her own to counter them.</p><p><br></p><p>The discussions lasted for the rest of the night before she cut the connection.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Salvatore -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Tired already?” Vritra asked as I slumped into my couch.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mentally, yes. Just fighting and training is far easier than all this….plotting and acting.” I sighed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, dragons rarely plot. I can see why going against your nature can be exhausting for you.” She manifested beside me and sat right in my lap.</p><p><br></p><p>The stimulation from her soft bottom, directly making me hard.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru was right.</p><p><br></p><p>She had an amazing ass.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why thank you.” She replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did I say it out loud?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“No dear, but it wasn’t hard to feel your intention.” She replied with a giggle before moving in my lap to make herself more comfortable, which meant that my erection was snuggling right inside her crack.</p><p><br></p><p>I took a moment to think about my life….about how it had changed….only a moment though before my hands snaked around to grab her and hold her from behind.</p><p><br></p><p>Vritra’s interest was quite evident.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Rimuru was okay with it. Actually, she was more than okay.</p><p><br></p><p>Both these women wanted to make a harem for me and….I wouldn’t lie and say that I am not interested.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean very few would be uninterested in having beautiful girls in a relationship with them.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, as someone who was basically attached to me, or as she says, a part of me, I would like to know her a bit better. She already knew me as she had a free view of all my memories.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why we had decided to spend some alone time like this everyday.</p><p><br></p><p>We talked about random topics or played games or something during this time.</p><p><br></p><p>________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s right. Put the weight of your whole body behind the attack.” I instructed.</p><p><br></p><p>Right now, my students are training in swordsmanship under me.</p><p><br></p><p>Chloe was the one who asked for this and I agreed. A while later, Kenya decided to join as well. He wanted to become an awesome swordmaster like Shizue-sensei.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, he even got the Divine Protection of the Light Spirit and was eligible for the Hero’s Egg.</p><p><br></p><p>We decided to let him train for a while till he was an Enlightened before Ramiris blessed him and gave him a Hero’s Egg.</p><p><br></p><p>Among all my students, he was the one who was the most impulsive so it was necessary to keep him from getting a big head so early on.</p><p><br></p><p>The other three were not interested in swordsmanship and stayed back to watch.</p><p><br></p><p>“Keep your sword straight. Put more of your back into the slash. Yes. That’s it.” I instructed.</p><p><br></p><p>This swordsmanship style was a mix of something I learned from Shizue, developed myself and found from the memories of Veldanava.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy had over a trillion years of memories so I had to choose and I chose his skills first. Swordsmanship was still being created but I had some hints.</p><p><br></p><p>This guy was the one who taught Rudra, one of the best swordsmen in the world, someone who could keep up with Guy with his swordsmanship alone. I could always learn a lot from someone like this.</p><p><br></p><p>I was still trying to figure out how to increase the speed of the process.</p><p><br></p><p><em>‘You could always get things left by Veldanava which contain his energy. Or some DNA of Milim Nava to incorporate the Star King Dragon Factor into yourself. It will allow you to use all the magic Star King Dragon Veldanava could use.’</em></p><p><br></p><p>Dragon factor huh.</p><p><br></p><p>Still….</p><p><br></p><p><em>‘Even a strand of hair from her would work.’</em></p><p><br></p><p>I see.</p><p><br></p><p>I will think of something.</p><p><br></p><p>Thank you, Sol.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly, I sensed a presence behind me and saw Dino walking there.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hello there. How are you liking the place?” I asked the guy with a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>“The place is good. Ramiris is a good boss.” He said, standing beside me.</p><p><br></p><p>I patted the ground beside me. “Come, have a seat.”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at me for a moment and sat down.</p><p><br></p><p>We sat quietly watching the kids spar.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t keep your legs so close to each other.” I shouted and corrected one of Kenya's postures.</p><p><br></p><p>“You really enjoy this.” Dino asked, looking at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. What’s not to enjoy? I am watching my students learn and grow. There are few things more fulfilling than this. I like my students and I like this place. Seeing them growing and prospering is something that makes me happy.” I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>He just stared at me with a look I just couldn’t place.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“This kingdom….these people….I have heard that they dragged you out of your home, separated you from your family, enslaved you, deprived you of your free will….then why….why do you protect them?”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the guy and then back at the children.</p><p><br></p><p>“The ones who did so were only a handful of people. A large majority….didn’t even know of anything.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But is this a good enough reason for you to dedicate yourself to protect them? I don’t understand….”</p><p><br></p><p>Hmm….how to explain this.</p><p><br></p><p>I suddenly recalled a line from an anime and a slight smile came to my lips.</p><p><br></p><p>“From where I come from, the King is like a father to his people, and….” I looked at the guy, my smile widening, “What kind of father needs a reason to protect his children?”</p><p><br></p><p>I saw his eyes widening and mouth opening a bit as he kept staring at me for a while.</p><p><br></p><p>“Dino?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“You alright?”</p><p><br></p><p>“....yes. Yes, I am alright.” He nodded his head, looking at the kids again. “Do you need a hand in teaching the kids? I happen to know some swordsmanship myself.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Really? I would love that. I was kinda in a pinch on what to do about them since I was so busy with work, I couldn’t give them as much time as I was hoping. Chloe and Kenya both have a lot of potential. Both of them have what it takes to become a Hero. The other three can easily become Saints. I don’t want their potential to be wasted.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I won’t let you down.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thanks. I knew I could rely on you.” I patted his back.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you for your praise….my King.” He replied with a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>The kids had completed their training so I called them all back. “Great work everyone. I have just the reward for you all. Today….we are having….Pizza!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yay!” The kids jumped in joy at the words.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Dino and called him too. “Come on. You have been working just as hard as everyone. It’s my treat.”</p><p><br></p><p>________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>Pizza was always good.</p><p><br></p><p>I learned how to make this when I was in the orphanage. I worked as a waiter for a nearby Pizza place and the owner made awesome pizza. He even showed me how to do it sometimes and let me practise.</p><p><br></p><p>By the end of the third month, I could make pretty good ones too.</p><p><br></p><p>….I wanted to make some for the kids of the orphanage on the day I was summoned.</p><p><br></p><p>Sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>“Teacher?” A voice from my lap broke my thoughts.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked down to see Chloe sitting in my lap and saw that her plate had been emptied and served her another slice before patting her head.</p><p><br></p><p>She made the most progress today so she could ask me for some reward and this was the reward she wanted.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Dino and his subordinates seemed to like the dish.</p><p><br></p><p>We were currently at Ramiris’ Labrinth. There was no way the glutton fairy was going to be left out of this.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hey, give me the one with more cheese. Don’t hog everything for yourself ne….”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the pixie in surprise. “Just where are you keeping those? I mean you are smaller than the slice of pizza. Just how in the world are you eating everything?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmph, I am a growing girl. I need my food.” She humphed as she nibbled at the end of the pizza.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Growing girl? Really? Why don’t I see it? You seem just as tall as the last time I saw you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hah? I have grown two whole millimetres, ya know. Two whole millimetres.” She stood on her toes and tried to show me her supposedly increased height.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure your hair isn’t frizzled due to the weather?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No no. I totally grew taller.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well if you say so.”</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, where is the second volume of the SpyxFamily manga? I didn’t see it with Veldora. Do you have it?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The second volume? I don’t think I’ve made that one yet.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then make it. I wanna see if Anya can become a Spy and help Lloyd in the mission. Also they are about to get a dog. A dog, you know.” She flew around my head, briefly returning to the pizza slice to take a bite and resume her buzzing.</p><p><br></p><p>“I like Yor’s dress.” Alice said. “I have even made a golem like her.” She bragged proudly.</p><p><br></p><p>I wasn’t lying when I said all my students were extremely talented.</p><p><br></p><p>Alice, the princess of the group or rather as she is called, the Empress, has very great talent in Creation Magic, especially Golem Creation and manipulating them like puppets. She fights by manipulating her stuffed toys to attack others.</p><p><br></p><p>We decided to put more power behind this by having her make Golems based on her favourite characters from the anime and manga.</p><p><br></p><p>Her best team consists of the Ten Sailor Guardians who she commands at her will.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru also spoils her too much.</p><p><br></p><p>She had Kurobe and the Dwarves make all ten of them with Magisteel and then enchanted with various effects and Magical Cores so that they could use different attacks similar to the anime counterparts.</p><p><br></p><p>I estimate that if she could control all of them in tandem, she could even take down seasoned Enlightened Beings, although she needs a lot of time and practice to reach such a level.</p><p><br></p><p>On top of this, she has a contract with a Space Elemental Spirit which helps her keep all these golems in her in a hammerspace of sorts to summon at her wish.</p><p><br></p><p>What came next is her summoning her newest golem and Ramiris fangirling over the golem while both of them discussed what to do next.</p><p><br></p><p>At this time, Aletia stepped into the room and behind her came Luminous and Ena.</p><p><br></p><p>She had accompanied her during her stay here and the two seem to get along quite well.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at me and then at Chloe and I suddenly felt her gaze turn cold the next time she stared at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Pizza?” I offered with a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>“Where is he?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the kids.</p><p><br></p><p>They all knew Yuuki and I didn’t want this conversation to be in front of them.</p><p><br></p><p>“We are having a party. Come join us. We can talk about work when the kids are fed and go to their beds.”</p><p><br></p><p>She seemed to realise what I was insinuating and nodded, taking a seat right opposite to me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, it has been a while since Ena had pizza. Did you make these?” The outspoken girl sat down and took a slice. “Mmhhh. This is good.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I worked at a Pizza Place before I was summoned.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A Pizza Place? Was the place made from Pizza?” Ramiris flew up to my face and asked with sparkling eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. How would that even work? It’s a place where Pizza is made and sold.” I replied, much to her disappointment.</p><p><br></p><p>Just like this, we got into a peaceful atmosphere.</p><p><br></p><p>There were a few ups and downs when Luminous tried to wipe the corner of Chloe’s mouth but the girl turned towards me instead, making the True Ancestor give me a death stare.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, lady. That was not my fault.</p><p><br></p><p>In this time I remembered Rimuru’s suggestion and decided to go for it.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s play a game.”</p><p><br></p><p>Material Creation was an easy skill to learn. Creating Monopoly with it was even easier.</p><p><br></p><p>The kids were very happy when I did so.</p><p><br></p><p>I explained the rules to the newest members of the group and we got down to the game.</p><p><br></p><p>A few calculated throws and poor investments and I was already the first one to lose.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha it seems I lost.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sensei, you suck.” Kenya, the one who made me bankrupt, laughed and I scratched the back of my head.</p><p><br></p><p>I wanted to check if my skill worked on more than one person at once <a href=\"https://and….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">and….it</a> worked.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>The Ultimate Skill Leviathan was stimulated by the loss.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p>And just like that a flurry of notifications sounded in my ears and this time, I was just happy.</p><p><br></p><p>________________________________x__________________________________________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am back with another chapter of ‘To be a Hero’.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sal managed to trick and capture both his targets.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Yuuki got caught in a bad position and he would have never expected his enemies to plan to this extent.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Jahil on the other hand wouldn’t even know what happened until he is dead, especially with so many people behind him.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Kagali had her world turned upside down.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Damrada, at this point he is just using copium.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Mariabell thinks she won, not realising that she has earned the ire of a Yandere True Demon Lord and a True Dragon.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Dino….we will see in the next chapter what is going on with him.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Luminous is just being jealous but isn’t able to do anything but grit her teeth and stay.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Leon on the other hand….</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Next chapter is going to be a lot of fun.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Things are picking up pace, bit by bit as the Western Nations come together.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I plan to do some side stories, maybe use the movies and even the games if possible.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The game had some pretty nifty characters which will make the story far more entertaining and challenging for Salvatore who has not played any.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I hope you’ll like it.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br></p>",

I mean we have seen the clowns participating in the fight of Clayman so, there’s a chance that she stays back or even if she comes, she would be alone with Yuuki Kagurazaka and not with her subordinates.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, that’s a valid concern.” The Empress of the Elves said and Olga looked at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“In that case we will hold her with us and spread the news for her subordinates to surrender in return for her life.” Sylvia said.</p><p><br></p><p>The woman was cold.</p><p><br></p><p>I took this opportunity to address another problem. “The Freedom Guild is a very big force in the continent and it was created and raised to this level by Yuuki Kagurazaka alone. If we put a hand on him, they are bound to raise a huge ruckus. We need to do it in a way that causes the least amount of problems.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, that’s hard.” Gazel scratched his beard in thought.</p><p><br></p><p>“Actually, that’s quite easy to do.” Rimuru said and we all looked in her direction. She continued. “If we want to reduce the backlash, we just have to take down someone else and not Yuuki?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?” I looked at her in confusion.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see… that would indeed be a good idea.” Sylvia said and I turned towards her.</p><p><br></p><p>“That… does seem like a good plan.” Gazel nodded as well.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes and this way, we end up looking good too.” Irisviel said.</p><p><br></p><p>What plan?</p><p><br></p><p>Our target was Yuuki right?</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully, I could keep my poker face for long enough while Rimuru explained for us peasants. “It means we announce that Yuuki Kagurazaka was actually replaced by a fake or was possessed by someone else who was collaborating with the enemies of the continent. With the support of all these countries, especially the Western Holy Church, people would more than likely believe us too.”</p><p><br></p><p>Oh!… that’s evil.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sasuga Rimuru-sama.” Shion praised from behind us.</p><p><br></p><p>Good to see that it was taken care of.</p><p><br></p><p>“In case Kagali doesn’t come here, I have sent some people to capture her.” The Empress said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then be sure to send someone strong enough to match them all. Kagali is a former Demon Lord who retains all of her powers and Footman and Tear are around the same level. Laplace… is however the strongest of them all.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I know that better than anyone. I have contracted some allies of the Sorcerer Nation Sarion and both mother and I will be going there too. I apologise but we can only send Homunculus to congratulate you on your coronation.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry, I understand. You should concentrate on your priorities first.”</p><p><br></p><p>We discussed a plan of attack for the enemies and the reasons we had to give to the public.</p><p><br></p><p>The meeting ended and everyone left for their own rooms leaving only Rimuru, our subordinates and I.</p><p><br></p><p>“Benimaru. You will be responsible for the protection of Tempest during the event. Diablo and Irisviel will be responsible for taking down any spies. Rin will assist you. Shiro and Masaomi will be responsible for the security at the venue.”</p><p><br></p><p>A series of agreements rang through the room.</p><p><br></p><p>“In that case, let’s go and rest for today. We have a busy day tomorrow.”</p><p><br></p><p>We left the room too.</p><p><br></p><p>But there was someone surprising waiting for us outside.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ena?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ena wanted to ask you about how you knew about Ena’s home. You said you will tell Ena later.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ah yes.</p><p><br></p><p>I was too busy these past few days and I did say that.</p><p><br></p><p>Hinata was with her and she looked at us.”If it’s something private then I will leave you two alone.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No, it’s fine. You can listen on in our conversation if Ena is fine with it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ena is.” The girl in question nodded and they followed us to our room.</p><p><br></p><p>“You see, I have certain visions, memories of several worlds, including this one. We have already explained about it in the meeting right. I just know things.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I did find it a bit suspicious but you were correct on most… almost all the parts.” Hinata corrected herself.</p><p><br></p><p>“I had some visions of her too. Ena Seishuuin, the heiress of the Seishuuin Clan, one of the Four Major Clans of Japan and the adopted granddaughter of the Heretic God Susanno who resides in the Netherworld and watches over Japan. You are good friends with Mariya Yuri. By the way, when did you come to this world?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"A year ago. Ena was in the second year of Middle School.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"And how many Campione are currently active in the world?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Six. The last one is the Italian King… Salvatore Doni. Are you the Italian King of Swords?\" She suddenly perked up and asked.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>\"I’m Italian and I am a swordsman named Salvatore but I’m not Salvatore Doni. Just to be clear, I have never been to your world.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next hour I explained the situation and a possible future path to her.</p><p><br></p><p>\"So Ena would have married the seventh Campione along with three other girls.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Umm well that's the future I know.\" I replied awkwardly.</p><p><br></p><p>\"It does sound like something grandma would put Ena to but since this hasn't happened yet and Ena is here, it doesn't matter. It seems that Yuri will have to keep those two Italian hussies away by herself.\"</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>\"I am Italian, you know.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"You are not a hussy. Ena wasn't referring to you.\"</p><p><br></p><p>… that's not what I meant.</p><p><br></p><p>Sigh. </p><p><br></p><p>Let's not try to hit my head against the wall.</p><p><br></p><p>But in any case I decided to offer her the same offer I had given to the other otherworlders.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I am making a small group of people in a similar situation as us, otherworlders who want to go back to their worlds in hopes of developing a method to do so. If you want, I would like to invite you to join.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Sure. Grandma and the rest must be worried about Ena too. Ena has been trying to find a way to go back home but hasn't been able to get anything.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Great. Welcome to the team.\"</p><p><br></p><p>After leaving her and Hinata, we went to meet someone about whom we had been informed.</p><p><br></p><p>There were a few people inside the room being entertained by Ramiris. The most prominent among them was a silver haired guy drinking tea and two others who were standing behind him quietly.</p><p><br></p><p>They both looked at me and I saw surprise in their eyes but they reigned it a moment later.</p><p><br></p><p>“Dino? What a surprise to see you here.” I greeted. “I hope my subordinates have treated you well.”</p><p><br></p><p>He kept down the cup of tea and nodded towards me. “Yes. They have been very kind.”</p><p><br></p><p>I took a seat in front of him. “So… what can I do for you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“First of all congratulations on becoming a king.” He said politely.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.” I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“The thing is… I have heard that you were hiring people for your kingdom and I wanted a place to crash?” He explained awkwardly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>Dino went on to explain how Dagruel had driven him out and he went to Guy who sent him to me because I was looking for people to recruit.</p><p><br></p><p>…did Guy send him to me instead of Rimuru?</p><p><br></p><p>But it was the truth that I needed people to strengthen my army and Dino might not look like it due to his usual lazy attitude but he is one of the very few True Demon Lords and was the right hand man of Veldanava himself.</p><p><br></p><p>Apart from that, a less known fact was that he was the best swordsman in the whole world, a fact which was accepted by even other powerhouses like Milim who is extremely good at using a sword herself.</p><p><br></p><p>Since such a guy was delivering himself to me, I would be an idiot to not take any advantage of him.</p><p><br></p><p>Not to mention, the two with him were also two of the seven Angels of Origin created directly by Veldanava and would be among the very top of this world.</p><p><br></p><p>They must be extraordinarily skilled at other stuff too.</p><p><br></p><p>I needed people to teach my soldiers and who better to teach than the generals of the literal God of this world in person?</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure. Welcome to Camelot.” I smiled. “We need as many hands as we can at this time.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you. This saves us a lot of trouble. These two are my subordinates.”</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly recalled their names. “Garcia and Pico, right.”</p><p><br></p><p>They nodded blankly.</p><p><br></p><p>“You know them?” Dino asked.</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded with a smile. “I guess I do. They are good names so they kinda stuck. I don’t remember from where though.”</p><p><br></p><p>They looked weirdly at me but didn’t say anything.</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully Ramiris broke their stare.</p><p><br></p><p>“See see, I told you that Sal will agree to you staying here.” Ramiris flew around his head like a little fly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Great. Then Masaomi-san, can you please see to their living arrangements. I will see what job I can assign to them.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.” The guy bowed and led them outside.</p><p><br></p><p>Ramiris followed them to talk with them and we were left alone in the room.</p><p><br></p><p>“He’s here as a spy. You know that right?” Rimuru said as she sat down in my lap while locking the room with a snap of her fingers.</p><p><br></p><p>I hugged her as she grinded her ass in my lap with a smirk, making herself comfortable. I didn’t stop her either and slipped my hands to cup her breasts.</p><p><br></p><p>One good thing about Slime Physiology was that she could change her body shape however she wanted.</p><p><br></p><p>She could go from teenage looking to a stunner milf look on the drop of a hat and with Raphael, she could mimic the human body to an extent where she could even manipulate her nerves and make herself as sensitive as she wanted to.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, it was as if she was made to be perfect.</p><p><br></p><p>“I know.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then?”</p><p><br></p><p>“But I need people and he just offered himself to me on a silver platter so who am I to reject.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So are you going to place him under Ramiris again?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Nope. I am going to make him work for me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You are going to recruit him? Are you not worried that he will leak all your secrets to Guy?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Guy is strong enough to destroy me with a flick of his finger. If I reject Dino, it would convey to him that I have things to hide and make him take other actions… and we are not ready for such actions. It’s better if we keep him here and show him only the things which we want him to see till he decides it’s enough and leaves.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, that does sound reasonable. By the way, what if he doesn’t leave?”</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled. “Then I make him work till he decides that he has enough and quits.”</p><p><br></p><p>“...hahahaha yup. That’s good.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So…” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I guess I still haven’t congratulated you on your upcoming coronation.” She smiled as she leaned in towards me and I didn’t back down either, capturing her lips with my own.</p><p><br></p><p>She quickly turned and straddled me with her legs on either side of me and her core directly on my rising hardon.</p><p><br></p><p>The next thing I knew, she ripped open my shirt and jumped on me for another hungry kiss.</p><p><br></p><p>I slipped my hands under her shirt and pulled it apart, tearing each button at a time, and finally freeing her breasts.</p><p><br></p><p>The two soft globes smashed against my chest and I focused my attention to her best parts, her pert ass, cupping and fondling them cheeks.</p><p><br></p><p>She was wearing leather pants made from the hide of an A Ranked Monster but A Rank was just so so in front of me. I grabbed the leather with my fingers and pulled them, applying just a part of my strength and the leather was ripped apart as if it was some kind of tissue paper.</p><p><br></p><p>It left her with just her panties on my lap.</p><p><br></p><p>“Black lace?”</p><p><br></p><p>She smirked. “Like what you see?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The answer is right below you. Can’t you feel it?” I was rock hard by now.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my. I guess I will have to take care of you then. Imagine the people of Camelot seeing their king with the holy sword excalibur in his pants. That wouldn’t look good at all.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“I guess I will have to use Excalibur to fight the Demon Lord in my lap then.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yosh. Show me what you’ve got, Hero.” She moved her hips to grind her core on my length again.</p><p><br></p><p>“Remember you asked for it.” I pulled her forward, taking one of her perky nipples in my mouth while my hand explored her other breast and ass.</p><p><br></p><p>My finger slipped into her crack, and brushed over her rosebud and she yelped in surprise, making me smirk proudly.</p><p><br></p><p>I continued the assault as I playfully bit her nipple and pinched the other one between my fingers.</p><p><br></p><p>She hugged my head, grabbing a fistful of my hair and pulled me into her breast even more.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly I felt my trousers fall. On looking closer, she had melted the trousers without harming my skin.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t mind.</p><p><br></p><p>It saved us the time from removing it.</p><p><br></p><p>Right now, her core was directly on top of my length and damn was she wet.</p><p><br></p><p>I am pretty sure it wasn’t due to her being a slime as she was currently mimicking a perfect human body.</p><p><br></p><p>I picked her up and placed her on the couch and got between her legs.</p><p><br></p><p>She had slender legs and her lower lips opened up to reveal a light pink colour, glistening under the light of the room. There was a small tuft of her light blue silver hair crowning the top of her core, making her look irresistible. </p><p><br></p><p>I got even harder if that was somehow possible.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked directly into her eyes. She, as if understanding my intentions, spread her legs further to give me access to her core and I dove headfirst into the meal.</p><p><br></p><p>She tasted… great.</p><p><br></p><p>So much so that I looked at her in surprise and saw a victorious smile on her face.</p><p><br></p><p>She could even manipulate how she tasted?</p><p><br></p><p>Wow.</p><p><br></p><p>Well, who was I to say no to such a delicious feast in front of me so I jumped in again beginning with a light kiss and then dove in to enjoy the taste again.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mmhhh.” She clenched my hair and pushed me further into her core.</p><p><br></p><p>One of my fingers found her hole while I flicked her bud with my tongue. She jerked upwards and I used this opportunity to push my finger in.</p><p><br></p><p>Her insides were both soft and hot and clung to my finger like a vice, caressing it between its soft folds.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ahh Mmm Ahh yesss, right there.”</p><p><br></p><p>I pulled back my finger and her waist raised as if to follow my finger. I didn’t disappoint her either as I pushed back in eliciting another moan from her.</p><p><br></p><p>A few moments later, I was thrusting inside her with a decent pace. Her voice was like music to my ears.</p><p><br></p><p>I increased the fingers to two and increased the pace and sure enough, in just a few minutes, she was shaking her waist in tandem to the moment of my fingers before her grip on my hair tightened and her body stiffened and jerked, tremors running down her body.</p><p><br></p><p>She came.</p><p><br></p><p>I pulled my finger out and licked it clean as I looked at her, laying on the table with her legs spread, hair dishevelled, legs glistening from wetness. There was even a line of saliva on the corner of her lips.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall, she looked absolutely exotic.</p><p><br></p><p>I leaned in and took her lips once more and her arms instantly wrapped around me followed by her legs around my waist.</p><p><br></p><p>This kiss was calmer but much more passionate than anything before.</p><p><br></p><p>We pulled apart and looked into each other's eyes. There was no need for words.</p><p><br></p><p>She adjusted herself right above me and I slowly pushed upwards.</p><p><br></p><p>She was hot and even wetter than before.</p><p><br></p><p>Slowly, I entered her till the hilt. She grabbed me and pulled me in for another kiss while I began thrusting with reckless abandon.</p><p><br></p><p>One of her skills was physical attack nullification which meant I didn't need to worry about hurting her.</p><p><br></p><p>There was something else that we forgot in our excitement.</p><p><br></p><p>The furniture didn't have any resistance skills.</p><p><br></p><p>Less than a minute in, the table crashed into the ground with a loud noise… . But none of us cared and just continued, completely engrossed in each other.</p><p><br></p><p>I pounded her into the floor relentlessly and she never let go of me the entire time. Several minutes later, I felt my first climax approaching and increased my speed, letting out my seed deep into her body.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, I was not down.</p><p><br></p><p>With my current body, a Human hero saint as well as the Dragonoid part of me I could go on for days if I wanted to and Rimuru, just like me, could accompany me.</p><p><br></p><p>And so….I didn’t even pull out and we continued our lovemaking.</p><p><br></p><p>She could freely manipulate her body, even the insides so that it felt as if she was massaging my length with her insides, making me hard again in no time.</p><p><br></p><p>It was going to be a long….a very long but enjoyable night today and I was going to make full use of it.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Shion -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She was waiting outside the room for Rimuru-sama, who was discussing some important things about tomorrow’s coronation ceremony in private with Salvatore-sama.</p><p><br></p><p>Beside her was Jibril, the Tengu serving Salvatore-sama, guarding the gates so that no one disturbed the meeting.</p><p><br></p><p>These past weeks had been one thing after another, from the attack of the Falmuth kingdom to Rimuru-sama becoming a Demon Lord and even Salvatore-sama arriving at Tempest and then becoming the King of the Kingdom which had attacked them.</p><p><br></p><p>But Rimuru-sama explained to them the situation and why she was taking these actions.</p><p><br></p><p>Salvatore-sama had a history with these people. They had dragged him away from his home, kept him as a slave in the kingdom and were going to kill and harvest his skill.</p><p><br></p><p>This was the man who had not only saved the life of their leader but also of the other people of Tempest, saved their clan members from slavery, was an ally who had fought for them against the Chaos Dragon and was a dear friend of Rimuru-sama and of the entire Jura Tempest Federation….and these people….they had the audacity to…</p><p><br></p><p>She as well as many others of Tempest was half of the mind to attack the country but Rimuru-sama argued that the citizens of the kingdom were not responsible for the foolishness of the King. They didn’t even know what was going on.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru-sama thought that it would be for the best if Salvatore-sama took the throne. Something about it being poetic justice which she didn’t understand.</p><p><br></p><p>What did it have to do with poems?</p><p><br></p><p>She personally thought Rimuru-sama just wanted to dress him up in the new dress which she had Kurobe and Shuna-hime make.</p><p><br></p><p>Anyways, she was happy as long as Rimuru-sama was happy.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly, they heard a small voice from inside.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a bit odd but she was sure it was Rimuru-sama’s voice.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at Jibril who was looking at the door oddly too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you hear the voice too?” She asked the other girl who nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>But it didn’t sound like Rimuru-sama needed anything so she didn’t question and they just stood guard outside the gate.</p><p><br></p><p>Jibril was someone she got along with. They had gone out a few times to deal with some of the older king’s people who had tried to rebel and unlike others in the group, she could understand and agreed more with Jibril’s method of dealing with them- throwing a nuclear rupture magic at their face.</p><p><br></p><p>Why did they have to think so much for those idiots who were planning to disturb their master’s peace?</p><p><br></p><p>The sounds didn’t stop however and on listening closely, she found that it sounded like moans.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“Ahhh mmahh yesss, right there.”</em></p><p><br></p><p>She raised her eyes. “What do you think they are doing?” Jibril asked her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm? I know! Maybe Salvatore-sama is giving her a shoulder massage. Yes, that must be it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! A shoulder massage. Yes, that does sound like it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It does remind me… there were some rumours from the dwarf’s…” Jibril came closer to her and whispered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you know that there are some fortune tellers in Dwargon who can predict and tell who the soulmate of people will be.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Really?!” She asked, perking up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm hmm… and when Rimuru-sama was there, she even had her fortune foretold.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What?!” She yelped in surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru-sama’s soulmate!</p><p><br></p><p>“Who? Who did those fortune tellers predict?” Was someone trying to scam Rimuru-sama and trick her?</p><p><br></p><p>“It was…” However before Jibril could answer, they heard a crashing sound from inside the room and a grunting noise from both Rimuru-sama and Salvatore-sama and both of them jumped into action immediately, opening the door only to see a scene which none of them had expected.</p><p><br></p><p>Her mind blanked completely but was brought back by a hand grabbing her face and carrying her out of the room as the door closed again.</p><p><br></p><p>Beside her, Jibril had received the same treatment.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at the owner of the hand to see a blonde haired woman in front of her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Vritra-sama!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Now now, no need to go in there and ruin their first night together.”</p><p><br></p><p>“F-f–f-first night!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Kihihihi, is that so unbelievable? They have been flirting with each other since the first time they met and Veldora tells me that they are fated with each other.” Vritra-sama looked at her. “Although… there were apparently others in the crystal ball too. My word, it seems like my partner is quite famous with the ladies. Then again, dragons always attract beauty and power to themselves. It has always been like this so it’s not a surprise either.”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked confused about the words or maybe her mind hadn’t caught up with the first revelation either.</p><p><br></p><p>She quickly looked questioningly at Jibril who furiously nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>Shion found herself open mouthed at the confirmation.</p><p><br></p><p>‘Bu-but… Rimuru-sama…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oho, you seem to have something to say?” Vritra-sama asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Kihihihi so obvious. So you like her too?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Wha… ! No… it’s…” Shion blushed and stuttered for words. “I just respect Rimuru-sama and want her to be happy. And… Salvatore-sama is actually a very good partner…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Kihihihi so adorable. Tell me child, did you not hear the rest of my words?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, I guess I will reward my partner for restoring me back again. Say… what makes you think you cannot join the two of them… after all, what kind of King has only one wife or lover? Not to mention Rimuru also has some… unique tastes…”</p><p><br></p><p>It was as if lightning struck her mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Virtra-sama looked at them sagely. “So you both seem to understand. Well, then you better get to work so that you are not left behind by others. Obviously… you will still have to wait in line for a bit.” Vritra-sama licked her lips.</p><p><br></p><p>Vritra-sama cast a small barrier, isolating the room from others so that only they could hear whatever was going on inside and protecting the place as well.</p><p><br></p><p>Then she gave them some instructions on what to do to gain the position in the Imperial Harem.</p><p><br></p><p>Some of these plans were… Sasuga Vritra-sama… as expected of a True Dragon.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Salvatore -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I was laying beside Rimuru, on a collapsed bed. Around us, the entire room had been reduced to rubble. Midway through our session, I had to use Uriel to coat the place to avoid destroying the building.</p><p><br></p><p>There was already a barrier around the place and I recognised it as Vritra’s handiwork.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly it struck me. “Did she… see everything?”</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru shook beside me. “Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>She was sleeping.</p><p><br></p><p>Beings at our level were not tired from just a night of sex… it was just that we loved our usual rest and decided to take a break when our haze of lust subsided.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good morning.” I wished and she climbed on my chest to kiss me lightly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good Morning.”</p><p><br></p><p>She too realised the condition of the room and looked surprised. “We really need a more durable set of furniture for our home.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Right.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So, what were you worried about?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I… forgot about Vritra last night.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Vritra generally likes to sleep inside my body and I… forgot about her. It seems like she was awakened and left as well as made a barrier around the place.”<br><br>Her cute mouth opened at the revelation. “Well, that explains why no one entered the room even with… all this.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I guess so. I will thank her later.” Although it will be incredibly awkward to bring up the topic.</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully, Veldora likes to live in the Dungeon and read manga all day.</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t need to worry about me. I quite enjoyed the show.” Speak of the Devil… or in this case, the dragon, I heard the voice of my Dragon partner inside my head through our Soul Corridor. “Although if you want to please me, I wouldn’t mind joining in on the fun next time.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure. I don’t mind it.” The answer didn’t come from me but Rimuru and I looked at my new lover in surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>“What! Have you seen that ass? I could bounce the planet on it.” She replied as if that explained everything, inevitably bringing the image of her ass in the forefront of my mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Damn… she did have a point.</p><p><br></p><p>“See, you like that too.” Rimuru smirked slyly.</p><p><br></p><p>I shook my head. There was no way I could allow myself to be dragged into their flow. These two women are crazy… and they get along too well too.</p><p><br></p><p>“We have a busy day today. Let’s talk about it later.” I quickly changed the topic.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure… we can discuss it at length later on… maybe with some trials.” Vritra giggled inside my head, making me splutter in surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru laughed as well before raising her hand and pointing it towards the room.. “Beelzebub.”</p><p><br></p><p>All the debris of the entire room was swallowed by her Ultimate Skill Beelzebub. The next moment, the restored furniture was spat back into the room once more and the room returned back to how it was yesterday.</p><p><br></p><p>… that was so fucking useful.</p><p><br></p><p>Having had enough of teasing me for the morning, both the ladies got up for the rest of the events of the day too.</p><p><br></p><p>________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>It was time. I was ready to face the crowd.</p><p><br></p><p>\"You look awesome.\" Rimuru said as she fixed my cloak.</p><p><br></p><p>Apparently Kings wore cloaks here.</p><p><br></p><p>And believe me when I say… cloaks are very overrated. They are extremely inconvenient to wear.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Is it just me or does this look familiar? It looks like I have seen this somewhere?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"You are just imagining things.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I am not! This is totally the costume of Arthur from the Fate series.\" I retorted.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Any similarities are purely coincidental.\"</p><p><br></p><p>I let out a sigh and let her have fun. After all, she was having fun and no one was getting hurt.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at myself in the mirror. I totally looked like Arthur Proto… And dare I say that it looked awesome.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you ready for the show?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. I still don’t believe I am doing something like this.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Really? You have been isekaied… twice… into anime worlds… and this is the thing which you find unbelievable? I think that ship has sailed already.”</p><p><br></p><p>My lips twitched at her words. She wasn’t wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>“Touché.”</p><p><br></p><p>I walked out of our room and Rimuru went to the other side to rest of the group.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the gate in front of me and took a deep breath.</p><p><br></p><p>This is it.</p><p><br></p><p>And with that I walked forward.</p><p><br></p><p>Both Shiro and Masaomi were waiting for me outside the door and followed behind me to the stage.</p><p><br></p><p>Several prominent people were gathered in the place.</p><p><br></p><p>Gazel Dwargo representing the Dwarven Nation, Erald and the Empress had sent their Homunculus, representing the Sorcerer Nation of Sarion.</p><p><br></p><p>The Kingdom of Bulmund had sent their representatives due to the reference from Rimuru. It was guildmaster Fuze.</p><p><br></p><p>Apart from them, the members of the Council of the West had also sent representatives.</p><p><br></p><p>These people… they were utter pieces of crap.</p><p><br></p><p>The Council of the West is a collection of nations west of the Jura Tempest Federation. It was originally established as a collaborative initiative aimed at addressing the looming menace of monstrous threats. Over time, its role evolved into a formidable organisation primarily designed to serve as a check on the Eastern Empire's influence. </p><p><br></p><p>Basically a bunch of weaker nations teaming up to protect themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>But their methods were actually quite annoying. It was also one of the reasons why we went through such a roundabout route to make me the King of this place rather than me just walking in and beating up anyone who said otherwise.</p><p><br></p><p>They had their headquarters in the Kingdom of Ingrassia. Geographically, Ingrassia's location made it the most convenient focal point for council members to convene. Consequently, it became the natural choice for the headquarters of the Free Guild, an organisation closely intertwined with the council.</p><p><br></p><p>The Council acted as a mediator between nations, weighing each member's interests against the others’ and managing them to prevent conflict. It held power in both economic and political circles, making it a strikingly influential group in the region.</p><p><br></p><p>The council had no standing military force as it didn't need one. That's because, in a way, the Council formed the higher bureaucracy of the Free Guild itself. The money paid to adventurers for slaying monsters came from Council funding—and in exchange, the council had the right to give orders to the guild.</p><p><br></p><p>This funding came from contributions provided by each member nation, which varied depending on how much speaking rights each one had. Refusing to pay these meant leaving the council. It was a way for the council to gain a louder voice in local affairs, using the shield of security it offered members. Many nations relied almost wholly upon the guild for monster management, and that meant there was no choice for them but to support the council. </p><p><br></p><p>This made them close to Yuuki, the guildmaster of the Freedom Guild too as they were extremely reliant on them.</p><p><br></p><p>One more obstacle in the path of removing Yuuki directly without all of them banding together to oppose us.</p><p><br></p><p>As for the guy in question himself,  I looked in the corner and sure enough Yuuki was there too.</p><p><br></p><p>He stood there with a smile on his face but I didn’t notice Kagali with him.</p><p><br></p><p>Seems like the precautions on the Empress’ side was going to be of use.</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully, I had other supporters here.</p><p><br></p><p>Beside him, stood another figure.</p><p><br></p><p>Hinata Sakaguchi stood in as the representative of the Holy Kingdom Ruberios with Ena just behind her.</p><p><br></p><p>Luminous couldn’t appear here for obvious the same reason as to why the other Demon Lord friends of mine couldn’t appear here.</p><p><br></p><p>They were still laying in wait for my signal.</p><p><br></p><p>One thing had to be said for Hinata, this woman was stone cold. She didn’t show one shred of emotion on her face, even when standing beside Yuuki, even with everything she knew about him.</p><p><br></p><p>Ena was similar but instead of keeping a stoic emotion on her face, she wore her mask of usual casual attitude.</p><p><br></p><p>On the other side of Yuuki was another figure.</p><p><br></p><p>A blonde haired, pink eyed young girl who looked to be around ten years old. She was the princess of the Siltrosso Clan, Maribelle Rosso and was accompanying a representative of her country to this ceremony</p><p><br></p><p>I had some memories about her too and that only made me more wary about her.</p><p><br></p><p>The council of the west had roles during the war too.</p><p><br></p><p>Within the Western Nations, the member countries of the Council of the West generally maintained a remarkable peace among themselves. Even in the rare instances where conflicts did arise, they strictly adhered to formal declarations of war and a set of stringent rules governing warfare. Deviation from these rules would trigger a collective response from the Council, with all member nations rallying against the transgressor.</p><p><br></p><p>For situations where non-member nations were engaged in disputes, the Council maintained a policy of non-interference, regardless of the victor or loser. However, if one of the parties involved in such conflicts engaged in exceptionally cruel and inhumane conduct beyond reason, it would undoubtedly tarnish that nation's standing within the Council's ranks.</p><p><br></p><p>Unfortunately, this was not applicable when the said actions were against the monsters of the Jura Tempest Federation… or the otherworlders.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, several of the nations were among those who used the otherworlder summoning Ritual and even the Falmuth Kingdom had obtained the ritual from them.</p><p><br></p><p>They did however keep it out of public eyes and denied any accusations.</p><p><br></p><p>The people who were summoned would never be able to say anything because of the Lock Spell on them and even if they were somehow found, they were just erased or some excuses were given like them being Stray Otherworlders instead of the Summoned Ones.</p><p><br></p><p>Not to mention, these nations had deep ties with each other, economic, political, military as well as familial ties through marriages.</p><p><br></p><p>Because of this, the dynamics shifted significantly when a member nation of the Council found itself under invasion by an external force. In such cases, member nations possessed the right to request assistance and support from the Council. This principle formed a pivotal rationale behind the Council's inclusion of numerous small kingdoms among its membership, as it ensured collective defence and solidarity in times of peril.</p><p><br></p><p>Behind the scenes, from what little memories I had and what I could find out, the Rosso Clan controlled the Council with Granbell Rosso, her grandfather, a man who was a True Hero over a century ago.</p><p><br></p><p>He had lost a fight against Luminous and had agreed to serve her but was acting suspiciously now.</p><p><br></p><p>The only reason none of these people had acted against me was the fact that it was declared an internal matter of the Falmuth Kingdom and they were told not to interfere by Youm, who was related to an Earl of this Kingdom or things could have been much worse.</p><p><br></p><p>I walked to the platform at the front and Youm, the Champion walked up to my side.</p><p><br></p><p>“My fellow countrymen… Today we have gathered here for a very great event, the coronation of our new King, Lord Salvatore.”</p><p><br></p><p>The crowd, following Youm’s words, turned their attention towards me.</p><p><br></p><p>“As all of you might already have heard, the previous King Edmaris had led an army to invade the monster Nation of Tempest and incurred the wrath of the Storm Dragon Veldora, leading to the… unfortunate demise of thousands of our countrymen. It even gave rise to a new Demon Lord in the Jura Forest, Rimuru Tempest. All because of the foolishness and greed of one man.”</p><p><br></p><p>The people down there murmured among themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>“But it might have been due to the blessings of the Gods and Greater Spirits which sent this man… to us at such a time.” Youm looked towards the guests present and continued. “Lord Salvatore was summoned to this world by the previous King Edmaris, dragged out of his world, his home, against his wish and….enslaved here by the former guardian of Falmuth Nation, Razen, only to make him fight against his will. Yes….summoning otherworlders is banned and it was still done. The proof of this has already been distributed throughout the Kingdom and put up on every Bulletin Board in the entire Kingdom.”</p><p><br></p><p>The people were quiet by now.</p><p><br></p><p>“With something like this, any normal person would have harboured intense hatred for the Kingdom, even for the people….I know I would….but….Lord Salvatore, not only didn’t blame us for the misdeeds of the former King but also decided to step in to protect the people of this country….and not just from anyone but the infamous Storm Dragon Veldora, a power so great that he is known as a Natural Disaster. In doing so, he had to give up his humanity but even so, he didn’t hesitate and protected us with all he had. Tell me my friends….my countrymen….can we ever get another King like Lord Salvatore?”</p><p><br></p><p>The people roared in agreement to Youm’s words.</p><p><br></p><p>Wow….this guy was quite good with his words.</p><p><br></p><p>I remember that he was the one elected as the King of the Falmuth Nation by Rimuru in the novels.</p><p><br></p><p>Now it seems that the guy was quite fit for the job.</p><p><br></p><p>Youm continued while I was lost in my thoughts. “In that case, my countrymen, I give you….King Salvatore.” He picked up a crown from a tray in the hands of his uncle, an Earl of the Kingdom and placed it on my head.</p><p><br></p><p>The people below all cheered.</p><p><br></p><p>I stepped forward.</p><p><br></p><p>My Kingdom….</p><p><br></p><p>The words sounded so weird.</p><p><br></p><p>“I… am Salvatore. Some of you might know of me but many of you don’t. It’s not that I had done much to be known before this. I… have had a history with this kingdom as Youm said… and it was not a pleasant one but this history was with a select few people and I do not blame others for it. When I was invited to become the new King of this Kingdom, I had first rejected it… because according to me, I didn’t know what it meant to be a King and I didn’t want to let my inexperience become a cause for the troubles of the innocent people of this Kingdom. I intended to leave. But things happened… as you all know and might have seen already and one way or the other, I was dragged into this position.”</p><p><br></p><p>The entire crowd listened to my words.</p><p><br></p><p>“I know that I might not be the greatest King at this moment. I might be young. I might be inexperienced.”</p><p><br></p><p>The people murmured among themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>And here I raised my voice. “But I promise you this… that as long as I live… I will give my all for this Kingdom and make sure that all of you see a brighter tomorrow. This… I promise.”</p><p><br></p><p>And the crowd cheered loudly.</p><p><br></p><p>Now to complete my promise to Rimuru.</p><p><br></p><p>“My first decision as the King of this Kingdom is to rename it to Camelot. The previous name of the Kingdom has many… unfortunate memories associated with it both for the people and me and I wish to make a fresh start. Camelot means a place of great happiness. It is the name of a great Kingdom from the myths in my world… and I intend to make this Kingdom the same… and in doing so… I need your help. So will you all… lend me a hand?”</p><p><br></p><p>Loud cheers of agreement rang through the entire place drowning any and all news.</p><p><br></p><p>With everything done, I took the throne and the cheers continued.</p><p><br></p><p>Next was the series of greetings and gifts from the surrounding Kingdoms.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Olga Discordia -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She stood in front of the group of people gathered to capture Kagali, the former Elven Princess and her subordinates, one of whom was her own brother.</p><p><br></p><p>They had made the move as soon as they discovered that Yuuki Kagurazaka had left for Camelot without his secretary.</p><p><br></p><p>The people gathered here were from completely different backgrounds but each one of them had their own reasons for the capture of this group.</p><p><br></p><p>The Elves were obvious.</p><p><br></p><p>Three girls from Camelot, Rin Nohara, Aletia and Mjjuran, were also sent by her Master to assist her.</p><p><br></p><p>They were the former members of Clayman’s troops and were somewhat aware of the mode of attacks of the opponents.</p><p><br></p><p>Along with them was a girl from the Monster Nation of Tempest.</p><p><br></p><p>It was the three tailed fox which was saved by Lady Rimuru during the Walpurgis and named. She had evolved into a Nine Tailed Fox.</p><p><br></p><p>Next was a support called by Elmesia herself, the long time friend of the Sorcerer Nation of Sarion, former hero and the current Demon Lord, Leon Cromwell.</p><p><br></p><p>He had arrived with his four best knights to assist in the capture of the opposite group.</p><p><br></p><p>This alone showed how highly Elmesia and Lady Sylvia were taking this mission.</p><p><br></p><p>Elmesia took charge of the mission herself.</p><p><br></p><p>“Our people have been stationed at every corner of this place in disguise and will activate a barrier which will inhibit any spatial type skills from anything under a Saint and even against a Saint, it will hold them out long enough for us to take action. Several of our best mages will be tracking Kagali at all times. The plan is for Leon to attack her with his subordinates blocking the routes of escape. We will wait until she falls into a desperate situation just to draw out her subordinates… all of them and only then do we go all in. Remember, her actions were largely due to Jahil. We are not to kill any of them. We will go for the core of the reason, Jahil himself when Footman is captured. He must not escape at all this time. Is everyone clear about the plans?”</p><p><br></p><p>There were nods of agreement.</p><p><br></p><p>“According to the information provided by King Salvatore,” Elmesia paused. “Laplace is by far the strongest among them and has a skill which allows him to see a few seconds into the future, thus our plans were made in a way that he wouldn’t be able to utilise this advantage and for this reason, it’s necessary to follow every part of the plan perfectly. We do not have any chances to mess up.”</p><p><br></p><p>On affirmation Elmesia continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“In that case, we move on the signal.”</p><p><br></p><p>The signal was given a few minutes later and everyone raced towards the target.</p><p><br></p><p>She took the place at the roof of the guild building, a place her Master had mentioned, and had the best view of the entire place from his one year stay here.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Kagali -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She was gritting her teeth at the sight of the monster in front of her.</p><p><br></p><p>Why was he here? And at such a time when Yuuki was away.</p><p><br>Why were things turning out like this?</p><p><br></p><p>First Clayman disappears, his armies destroyed by that abomination who had grown so strong in such a short time that he could even take down the Chaos Dragon by himself. If she had known this, she would have had him captured and brainwashed the first time she saw him.</p><p><br></p><p>But now… such an action was nigh impossible with their current powers. Even Yuuki was out there to congratulate him on his coronation while she gets left behind with this monster.</p><p><br></p><p>“Welcome to the Kingdom of Ingarcia, Lord Cromwell. The guildmaster is currently unavailable so I apologise for not being able to greet you on time.” She spoke politely as she walked forward to greet him.</p><p><br></p><p>He did have some interactions with Yuuki regarding the summoned children and she didn’t want to mess things up.</p><p><br></p><p>However his next words sent a shiver down her spine.</p><p><br></p><p>“Kazerim… I didn’t expect you to be revived… and in such a way. I guess it should have been expected from a Deathman… to keep on reviving as long as their astral bodies were not destroyed. I was ignorant last time so… let me make up for it this time.”</p><p><br></p><p>“W-what are you saying, Lord Cromwell?”</p><p><br></p><p>He however didn’t listen to her words and drew his sword and slashed towards her.</p><p><br></p><p>This madman.</p><p><br></p><p>She jumped towards the side to escape the attack.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is the meaning of this, Leon Cromwell?”</p><p><br></p><p>The man however didn’t answer and continued to attack, forcing her to dodge but at one point she couldn’t hold back. The barriers around the place prevented her escape and she had to do something so she responded with an attack of herself.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tch… so annoying. Just how did you find out about this?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Clayman’s last words were quite enlightening and I just had to search for the clues after that. It wasn’t that hard to find you when I knew where to look.” He answered before attacking again.</p><p><br></p><p>“Clayman’s… last words… What happened to Clayman?”</p><p><br></p><p>“He’s dead… soul destroyed and all trace of him erased. After all, that fool tried to control Milim Nava.”</p><p><br></p><p>A white rage took over her as she heard the words and she began to attack in earnest… but none of her attacks were able to hit him.</p><p><br></p><p>He was too fast to even keep track of.</p><p><br></p><p>Leon Cromwell was far stronger than when she had fought him last time before her previous death…. So much so that she was having trouble even seeing his moves and was only keeping up with her own God Grade equipment and artifacts…</p><p><br></p><p>One of his attacks slipped past her barriers and raced towards her.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly a few shadows flashed in front of her, stopping the attack with their combined efforts.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tear, Footman, Laplace… no! You cannot fight against him. Run. Just run away fast.” She shouted.</p><p><br></p><p>“That we can’t do my lady. We were made to protect and serve you after all.” Laplace smiled and faced the Demon Lord in front of them. “We will create a diversion, take the opportunity to flee. Tear, Footman, protect the Lady.” he spoke before charging towards Leon Cromwell.</p><p><br></p><p>She stepped forward to try to stop him but was held back by Tear who took her and ran away.</p><p><br></p><p>Footman took the lead and rolled at great speeds, using his Unique Skill Amplifier to further increase his speed and attacked the Barrier… but… before he could even reach the barrier, a flash of lightning crashed into him, creating a massive explosion in the area and throwing them away.</p><p><br></p><p>A crater formed in the area of the crash and dust covered the entire area but not for long as a massive aura erupted from the place, clearing the dust away, revealing the figure who had attacked Footman…</p><p><br></p><p>“No no no no NO!… why are you here… Milim Nava!” Her shout echoed throughout the place as barriers surrounded the entire place completely isolating the guild area from the rest of the town.</p><p><br></p><p>Any adventurers who had been rushing in to fight against the threats had been downed by the immense Demon Lord’s Haki from the girl in front of her.</p><p><br></p><p>Kagali fell to her knees, losing all hope.</p><p><br></p><p>________________________________x__________________________________________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I know many will not believe me when I say this….but I really didn’t want to leave it at this point.

I heard Rimuru's voice in my head.</p><p><br></p><p>Vritra's giggles didn't help either.</p><p><br></p><p>And let's not mention Veldora, who looked super hyped for all this.</p><p><br></p><p>I let out a sigh and drew my sword and calmly stepped forward.</p><p><br></p><p>Veldora started his own performance.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are next… Salvatore.” Veldora pointed his finger at me.</p><p><br></p><p>Ah, the cringe.</p><p><br></p><p>I still gritted my teeth and followed.</p><p><br></p><p>“You bastard… Veldora.” And started walking towards him.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Oh? You're approaching me? Instead of running away, you come right to me? Even though that foolish king tried and lost his life and army, like an exam student scrambling to finish the problems on an exam until the last moments before the chime?\"</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p> Kill me already.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru's plan for making me the Hero of the Falmuth Kingdom was to organise a Jojo stand-off between me and Veldora.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked so excited about it that I didn't have the heart to say no to her although I don't think anyone would be foolish enough to believe this.</p><p><br></p><p>It did help that Dio Brando's voice kinda reminded me of Clayman's, so think</p><p><br></p><p>\"I can't beat the shit out of you without getting closer.\"</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh ho, then come as close as you like.”</p><p><br></p><p>There is no way anyone is going to fall for this shit.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the crowd who were on their knees and… cheering for me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hero Savatore.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Defeat that Evil Dragon!”</p><p><br></p><p>“We are saved.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Fuck!</p><p><br></p><p>I refocused my thoughts on the battle? In front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>We clashed, making huge shockwaves and I was pushed back a little.</p><p><br></p><p>“Too slow, you’re too slow. Faust is an Ultimate Skill. Even without its power to manipulate probabilities, my speed and power far exceeds that of yours.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So it’s the same type of Skill as my Solomon. Not much in terms of physical capabilities but immense calculation powers. I wanted to try a little test to find out just how much more powerful Faust was compared to your Skill but it seems a test was hardly necessary.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Test? Is that what you call just patting me and not even enough to hurt. Well I guess you ripped my twenty gold coin pants, though?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Why are you Heros, so stubborn about admitting defeat? Hmph, I suppose I shall rise to your silly provocation, and test you just a little more.”</p><p><br></p><p>And then we clashed into a flurry of blows.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Rimuru -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Perfect.</p><p><br></p><p>The execution was perfect. If only she had a camera to record everything, it could have been much better than all those Live Action movies in her previous life.</p><p><br></p><p>She was standing among the crowd of nobles and commoners alike. Everyone was looking up at the sky.</p><p><br></p><p>It was the perfect atmosphere for the ascendance of a Hero.</p><p><br></p><p>Now the only thing that was left was… ’Do it Sal.’</p><p><br></p><p>‘Really? Do I really have to do it? This should be enough, right? Wouldn’t that be a bit too much?’</p><p><br></p><p>‘We discussed it already. We need to remove every chance of future rebellion. Your Dragonoid identity can be used to create dissatisfaction by some racist nobles. We need to take care of it as soon as possible.’</p><p><br></p><p>‘You just want me to say those lines.’ He shouted back.</p><p><br></p><p>Well… he was not exactly wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>‘Veldora, do it.’ She commanded.</p><p><br></p><p>“You cannot defeat me as a mere human. I am immortal. I am invincible. I am Veldora!”</p><p><br></p><p>‘Really… can’t we just fight it out?’ Sal almost pleaded.</p><p><br></p><p>‘No.’</p><p><br></p><p>‘Tch. Okay, here I go.’</p><p><br></p><p>He brought out a piece of her Anti-Magic Mask’s replica and put it on his face. “If I cannot defeat you as a human, then... I give up my humanity Veldora!” And he transformed into his Dragonoid form.</p><p><br></p><p>She too gave signals as her spies started spreading tales of the bravery of Hero Salvatore who gave up even his humanity to save the Kingdom and how King Edmaris had almost ruined the kingdom and all their lives.</p><p><br></p><p>In the meanwhile Sal fought with Veldora and flew towards the Jura Forest, while actually clearing a path towards the Sorcerer Dynasty so that the orcs could build a road easily between the places.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>– Salvatore –</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Two days had passed since the day which would forever be marked as a day in my darkest history.</p><p><br></p><p>For the people of Falmuth Nation, I was still fighting Veldora, which I was in a way, just not the way they expected me to.</p><p><br></p><p>Card Games are fighting too.</p><p><br></p><p>At this time, Gobuta came in with some interesting news.</p><p><br></p><p>“Rimuru-sama, there are some people who say they are Salvatore-sama’s subordinates. None of his other subordinates know them so we need his help.”</p><p><br></p><p>My subordinate?</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, where are they?”</p><p><br></p><p>“They are waiting outside where Diablo-dono is meeting them. He seems to know the woman in the lead.”</p><p><br></p><p>Diablo knows.</p><p><br>Ah… it must be her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Your people?” Rimuru asked me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Maybe.” I looked at Gobuta and asked. “What did the woman say her name was? How does she look?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Irisviel. She has white hair and red eyes.”</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru looked at me strangely. “It couldn’t be her, right?”</p><p><br></p><p>I rolled my eyes. “She is a Daemon I summoned and named. She must have returned after searching for some people for me. Search your memories for Testarossa.”</p><p><br></p><p>We walked outside where Irisviel and another blonde girl were facing Diablo. “Kufufufufu what brings you here, Blanc, Jaune? I hope you are not here to cause trouble. If so then I will have to remove you unfortunately.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hah! You wanna fight? Let’s go. Who’s afraid of you?” The blonde girl almost bristled at the comment, getting ready to fight.</p><p><br></p><p>“Noir.” Irisviel addressed him. “We are just here to look for someone. I do not intend to fight.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah… if so then it’s fine. By the way, I go by the name Diablo now.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You got named?” The blonde jumped up. “Seriously, what’s up with everyone getting named nowadays. First Blanc gets one and now even you? Who was strong enough to name you?” She asked, looking around.</p><p><br></p><p>“I was given this name by the most amazing personage in this world, Rimuru-sama.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Rimuru Tempest. Yes, I have heard of this name. My own Master says that she is a friend and asked me to find him here. Oh, I go by the name Irisviel now. This name was given to me by my Master, Salvatore.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, so you are serving Lord Salvatore. I take it that you brought Jaune to serve under him? Hmm, I should find some good servants for Rimuru-sama too. Has Violet been contracted yet? I wonder if she’ll be happy?”</p><p><br></p><p>We walked in at this moment. “Irisviel, you’re back. Are these the people you recruited?” I asked, looking around.</p><p><br></p><p>There were over two hundred people, both humans and Daemons gathered here.</p><p><br></p><p>Some of them looked decently strong too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Master. I heard of the war that you participated in and about you fighting the Storm Dragon Veldora so I came back to assist but now it seems I was worried for nothing. I apologise for misunderstanding the situation and jumping to conclusions.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. Don’t worry. You did what you thought was the right option. There have been a few changes in the plan.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I didn't agree to join without a fight. I won't serve anyone weaker than me.\" The blonde girl, Jaune spoke up.</p><p><br></p><p>Irisviel looked at me and smiled. \"I have a Pact to not fight with her or I would have done it myself.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I see.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Before I could say anything, Jibril took the opportunity to jump in. She and the rest got a decent boost to their powers.</p><p><br></p><p>I created a barrier in an empty area where the two fought.</p><p><br></p><p>By the end of the first minute, the first thing Rimuru said was…</p><p><br></p><p>\"These girls are too crazy, aren't they?\"</p><p><br></p><p>In these last few days, I had gotten a measure of Rimuru’s personality and if <em>she</em> of all people says someone is crazy, they sure as fuck are.</p><p><br></p><p>And indeed they were. They basically were an Angel and Demon version of the same people. The first attack from both sides was a Nuclear Collapse Magic. The rest were the same. These two threw around Nuclear Magic as if candies. By the end of the first hour, they were having more fun than anything, so I left the barrier as it is to let them fight it out. Solomon had already predicted that Jibril would win.</p><p><br></p><p>\"So, I take it that your journey was productive? Report.”</p><p><br></p><p>The report was much better than I was expecting. She went around the world and recruited any Daemons under her as well as Juane as well as any Otherworlders she could find.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a decent eight otherworlders, five of whom were stray ones while she freed the other three from a Kingdom who had summoned them. I marked the name of the Kingdom to pay a visit to later on and have a talk with their king.</p><p><br></p><p>“You said that three of the stray otherworlders were from the Eastern Empire?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Master.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“I want you to question all the otherworlders about their loyalties to check if they are spies. You should never underestimate the Eastern Empire. There is a high chance that they could have sent some spies disguised as normal otherworlders. Not to mention, our main enemy currently owns the Freedom Guild and has connections with many otherworlders. We need to be especially careful when recruiting them.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Understood Master.”</p><p><br></p><p>She even gave me the name of several up and coming mercenaries. For the rest, we have decided to attract humans and half humans in the Dungeon opening in Tempest and then hire anyone who wants to join our side.</p><p><br></p><p>The battle between Jibril and Jaune finished in a while. Jibril won, surprisingly or unsurprisingly as Solomon had predicted.</p><p><br></p><p>I gave her a new name… Megumin, since she was so fond of throwing explosions.</p><p><br></p><p>Irisviel questioned all the recruits while I checked them with Milim’s Eyes. We found five spies among two hundred recruits. I left them to her.</p><p><br></p><p>She was quite adept in politics. Both Diablo and her were working on the Falmuth Kingdom to remove the ones who were against my rule, mostly the faction under the last King’s cousin who wanted to take the throne for himself.</p><p><br></p><p>During this time, I invited the former Hidden hand members to work for me. They agreed easily.</p><p><br></p><p>“They really are anime characters.” It was probably the fiftieth time that Rimuru said this, but it still seemed weird to her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Really having such a hard time believing it? Even after the memories I gave you?” I asked as I lay down to take some rest.</p><p><br></p><p>“But, I was a guy in that. It still has differences so it’s still bearable. Cleria and Masaomi seemed to be from your previous world. They knew about those chess pieces and Sacred Gears.” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. They are.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you going to tell them?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I don’t want to hide from them.” He replied. “They have vowed to work for me. So I don’t want to betray their trust in me. They have had more than enough time to cope with things and Rin has been asking me if I knew about her.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hiding these things longer will only cause trouble later on for everyone. Not to mention, knowing a possible future of the world will allow everyone to decide what they want to do. Maybe even give everyone a new goal in life. Having a goal in life can do wonders.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Still thinking about your little brother?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. It’s hard not to. I basically raised him with my own two hands. Now I don’t even know how he is doing.”</p><p><br></p><p>She put a hand on my shoulder. “Don’t worry. We are going to find a way back to your home.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, I know.”</p><p><br></p><p>The whole ascension thing was a massive pain. The opposing faction wanted to ask help from the Western Holy Church to drive away the ‘Monster’ who was taking over the Kingdom.</p><p><br>As much as I wanted to deny it, Rimuru had been right. The thing about my race did come and I don’t believe her plan actually worked. The public actually bought all that bullshit and thought that I was sacrificing my humanity for them. Moreover, I was still half human so in a way similar to the Elves and Dwarves, which reduced a lot of backlash. I was still a Hero which only Humans and Half Humans could become. So their argument was deemed lies.</p><p><br></p><p>The final nail in the coffin was when the Western Holy Church not only denied their request but actually supported me as the new King. They blamed the previous King with proof of using false information to lead the Church against Tempest and almost causing a disaster for the Kingdom. They said I saved the Kingdom so they support my rule. Hinata herself will be coming to my coronation ceremony.</p><p><br></p><p>The Dwarves and the Elves were next to follow and sent envoys to declare their acceptance of both my rule and Tempest as the new Kingdom of Monsters.</p><p><br></p><p>I had issued an order for a recruitment of soldiers. The entire Kingdom’s army had died in the attack on Tempest.</p><p><br></p><p>A country needed an army. I couldn’t protect the whole place alone. Not to mention, the entire country’s economy was mostly reliant on the Toll Charges and trade through their borders which was rendered moot due to the roads opening through Tempest so the entire Kingdom needs a new source of income.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a mess alright.</p><p><br></p><p>The solution was unknowingly handed to us by Ramiris.</p><p><br></p><p>Instead of Tempest, the new Labyrinth was opened in Falmuth and Rimuru’s condition for this was… to rename the Falmuth Kingdom to… Camelot.</p><p><br></p><p>She was a hardcore Arthur Pendragon fangirl it seems.</p><p><br></p><p>Ramiris was fine with it too and so we started the construction of the Labyrinth in Falmuth or rather Camelot soon.</p><p><br></p><p>There were other advantages of Ramiris living here too. The Dryads had accompanied Ramiris to the borders of the Kingdom and their magic made the growth of crops in the entire country flourish.</p><p><br></p><p>In return, I ordered for a great hall to be built in the honour of the Spirits.</p><p><br></p><p>As for the army, Shiro and Masaomi were helping out in the selection and training of the people.</p><p><br></p><p>Both of them, especially Shiro, had the experience of training elites for the Church in their worlds and they used this expertise to select people for my army.</p><p><br></p><p>The Great Hall of Spirits will allow people to make a contract with the Spirits if they pass a simple test set by the Spirits as well as by clearing certain levels in the Labyrinth. We set it as a reward for clearing certain floors.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiro, Masaomi and Rin all three got blessings from the Spirits.</p><p><br></p><p>Masaomi got a Light Spirit while Shiro surprisingly got a Dark Spirit.</p><p><br></p><p>It might have something due to him being possessed by Satan just before he was summoned. The guy even inherited his blue flames.</p><p><br></p><p>They were both blessed by Ramiris and were able to form Hero Eggs.</p><p><br></p><p>My Kingdom has three Heroes right now.</p><p><br></p><p>Rin was a bit different. I named Isobu and it evolved into a Greater Water Spirit, almost about to evolve into an Elemental Lord.</p><p><br></p><p>She decided to teach some people the basics of Ninjutsu and Stealth. She was a Chunin before she was summoned to this world and was quite good at what she could do, being taught by <em>the</em> Minato Namikaze. She was training my spies with some help from the Daemons.</p><p><br></p><p>Aletia and Cleria also got names.</p><p><br></p><p>The fun thing was Masaomi actually proposing to her. They got married a day later. I took the chance to name her Cleria Yaegaki.</p><p><br></p><p>I finally took the chance to tell them about how I knew about them all. Rimuru came up with a story that I just had memories of several worlds. We didn’t need to tell them that they were anime worlds to prevent shock.</p><p><br></p><p>Rin had almost gone into a nervous breakdown while Aletia was finally showing signs of emotions on realising why she was locked in the dungeon by her uncle. It didn’t make things right but it did take a step towards it. Now they want to find a way back to their home words to help them out.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiro on the other hand had taken it as a man of his experience. He was actually happy to see his children grow into the people they become although he was still worried. As for Masaomi and Cleria… well they were weirded out. I know the feeling. I felt the same too.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the thought that the future of the world rested in the hands of an idiot who went around shouting boobs… I’d not be surprised if Clayman seemed like a better idea all of a sudden to the two people.</p><p><br></p><p>Milim had returned after two whole weeks of work. Her kingdom had suffered a lot due to the attack. I kept most of the damage contained but the miasma had caused more than enough damage to the surroundings.</p><p><br></p><p>Taking care of all that was hard.</p><p><br></p><p>Milim accepted Clayman’s territory but she actually gave it to me as a thanks for saving Velgaia or as he was more famously known as, the Chaos Dragon.</p><p><br></p><p>I personally think she was already tired of Frey and Carrion’s kingdoms coming under her rule and didn’t want extra work so she threw it on my head.</p><p><br></p><p>I went and threw the new Kingdom under Olga Discordia or rather Sara Grimwald. The country was mostly inhabited by Dark Elves and who else to rule Dark Elves than Olga Discordia?</p><p><br></p><p>As we had decided, we were going to Meta the fuck out of this world.</p><p><br></p><p>So we did just the same. Both Rimuru and I sent out people to search for otherworlders and even strong humans and half humans.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally today, Hinata Sakaguchi came to Camelot. She was followed by Ena.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a surprise guest with her too.</p><p><br></p><p>“I didn’t think you’d come to be honest.” Looking at the figure under the hood, I said.</p><p><br></p><p>Luminous Valentine had decided to come here by herself.</p><p><br></p><p>“As much as I detest to remain in the vicinity of that abominable Lizard, this was too important to miss.” I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>We were about to discuss what to do with Yuuki and Kagali as well as the ones who could be behind the scenes in this whole incident.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru took this chance to come to the front. “Actually, I just found out from Sal about what Veldora had done. I would like to apologise for it.” She then looked at me and back to her. “In fact, we have decided that I will leave his punishment to you. Except for killing him off, you can punish him to your liking.”</p><p><br></p><p>… yeah. She was still pissed off at Veldora pretending to sleep when she tried to summon him during the Walpurgis.</p><p><br></p><p>Luminous didn’t reply but I could see that her mood had improved considerably.</p><p><br></p><p>I led them towards my palace but as luck would have it, we met some people on the way.</p><p><br></p><p>“Teacher.” All of them came running to me. I barely had any time to talk or play with them for the last few days. Aletia was accompanying them mostly.</p><p><br></p><p>My students had come to the Kingdom with Ramiris and now they were staying with Aletia most of the time.</p><p><br></p><p>Luminous stopped at the sight of Chloe and Aletia. “Who are they, Salvatore?”</p><p><br></p><p>Ah. The Yuri is strong in this one.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Sigh</em></p><p><br></p><p>“They are my students and she is my subordinate, Aletia.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A vampire?”</p><p><br></p><p> “Yes. She was summoned to this world by Clayman and forced to work for him. She joined me along with a few others after I freed them.”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at Aletia again. “If you ever need anything, you can contact me.” And then she gave her a ring while showing her her fangs lightly in a way no one would notice. I saw Aletia’s eyes widen but she nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>And then she turned her attention to the one who had attracted her attention in the first place - the girl who was receiving headpats from me.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is your name child?” She asked, politely.</p><p><br></p><p>Chloe looked at me and I nodded. “Hello, my name is Chloe O’ Bell. It’s nice to meet you.” She bowed.</p><p><br></p><p>The reaction was instant. She snapped to look at me. The question was clear in her gaze and yet she voiced it out. “I will hear everything inside.”</p><p><br></p><p>I just shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>Hinata who was following her merely looked confused.</p><p><br></p><p>I sent Chloe and the rest away with Aletia for a while and guided her to the room where the rest of the guests had already gathered.</p><p><br></p><p>Milim, Ramiris, Rimuru were already there but there were also some surprising guests. Gazel Dwargo was visiting and decided to participate.</p><p><br></p><p>Along with them was an elf with green eyes and long green hair beside whom sat another beautiful but androgynous woman with a youthful appearance that one could mistake for a child. Her distinctive features are her long pointed ears; snow-like skin; slanted, jade eyes, and long pale blue-silver hair that falls gently over her cheeks.</p><p><br></p><p>They were Sylvia El Ru Sarion and Elmensia El Ru Sarion, the progenitor of the Elven Race and her daughter, the current Empress of the Elven race. I had asked Olga to invite them because the story that I am going to reveal would more than likely make them take action.</p><p><br></p><p>Olga, as the ruler of the Puppet Nation Jistav, although my subordinate, sat at the table with everyone.</p><p><br></p><p>Luminous’ arrival raised several heads but they were not simple people either.</p><p><br></p><p>“So what is this meeting all about?” Erland took the opportunity to ask.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru took the lead at this moment. She was an expert at making stories somehow. She explained how we had discovered some information about the recent actions of Demon Lord Clayman.</p><p><br></p><p>“But Clayman is dead. I don’t see how any of this is a matter of concern now?” Gazel asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“On the contrary, Dwargo-dono. Clayman was but a puppet. The true enemy is still out there. We are planning to catch that enemy.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.” The guy nodded seriously.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s go with a story first. After the Star Dragon King Veldanava created the world, he gave work of populating the world to a man named Twilight Valentine. I think some of you are aware of this.” There were nods from some people while a twitch appeared on Luminous’ cute face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Twilight Valentine got into his work soon after. The first of these experiments was called Jahil, a High Human and the Ancestor of the entire human race. However, Jahil's behaviour was erratic and unsuited for Veldanava's desires, resulting in him and his fellow High Humans being deemed failures and Twilight moving on to create more races.” Rimuru further explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“Once the various races had spread across the earth and various nations had begun to form, Jahil and his scientifically advanced nation of High Humans set out to conquer the world and become its sole ruler. This eventually resulted in Jahil summoning the lord of the Daemon race Guy Crimson. You see, Jahil believed that so long as Guy was within the material world that he could be controlled by the magic that was forced upon him during summoning.” Several of the younger generations looked shocked while the older generation looked exhausted.</p><p><br></p><p>“That guy had always been a fool but this was a new high even for him. No wonder he died. Everyone thought Guy did it on a whim but…” The Elf Ancestor sighed.</p><p><br></p><p>“As we all know, Guy proceeded to destroy not only the nation he was fighting against but to also summon and then incarnate Rain and Misery, ordering them to slaughter Jahil and all the residents of his Super-Magic Empire while avoiding the use of mass destruction magic to increase their suffering. Thus….the first Demon Lord in the History of this world, was born. Due to the arrogance of a stupid human.”</p><p><br></p><p>Gazel and even Erland looked appalled at this. Even Luminous had her mouth open lightly for the first time.</p><p><br></p><p>“But that’s not where the story ends. You see, Jahil didn’t truly die back then. His spirit had survived.” Rimuru turned towards the Elf Ancestor. “After being killed by the fruits of his own stupidity, Jahil's spirit came to wander the earth for eons before eventually finding a host in… the king of the elven kingdom.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sylvia got a dangerous look in her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru continued. “The wise and kind king had built his city over the ruins of the Super-Magic Empire and made use of the technological secrets that lay within to create a prosperous nation called the 'Super-Magic Kingdom' for his entire race.”</p><p><br></p><p>By now, all the Elves in the room were paying attention to the story. “After Jahil made the king's body his own he proceeded to use the once peaceful kingdom as both a launchpad for the rebirth of the Super-Magic Empire and a testing grounds for his magical experiments. He became abusive and cold towards the king's daughter Kagali and began massacring people in order to use their corpses for his experiments with the ‘Birthday’ spell.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That bastard!” Erland growled. “It was his fault. I thought the King was acting weird.” he quickly took a deep breath and apologised. “I am sorry, I lost control of my emotions.” None of the people in the room blamed him either.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru gave the man a sympathetic look and continued. “Jahil's experiments culminated in him murdering Kagali and bringing her back to life as a Deathman. He had placed a curse upon her that would leave her appearance rotting, twisted, and ugly. When Kagali spoke back to her perceived father, begging him to return to his ‘peaceful and loving ways’ Jahil lashed out in anger and used the power of his curse to force Kagali to become a man, calling her his son and changing her name to… Kazalim.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What!”</p><p><br></p><p>Several exclamations ran through the room.</p><p><br></p><p>“But that’s…”</p><p><br></p><p>“The Princess? We thought she had died in the random killings.” Erland looked horrified at the shocking reveal.</p><p><br></p><p>The Empress didn’t say anything but I could see her knuckles turn white due to how hard she was clenching her fists. Her mother was looking almost emotionless at the reveal. She was probably expecting what was going to come next.</p><p><br></p><p>I took the chance to go and sit near Milim. She looked at me surprised but didn’t say anything and focused on the story, like everyone, for now.</p><p><br></p><p>“But that was not the end either. Once more Jahil's arrogance and stupidity resulted in his doom. He had secretly infiltrated the Nasca Kingdom and attempted to bring its Dragon Princess, Milim Nava, under his control.” She stopped and looked at Milim, who had frozen over from the news. Actually, at this point, every single person except Rimuru and I were stunned. Even Ramiris, who knew what was coming next.</p><p><br></p><p>I hugged her lightly to my side but she was unresponsive at this point. “Milim.”</p><p><br></p><p>She responded after a while. “I’m alright. Rimuru, go on.”</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru nodded and went on with the story. “He killed the girl's pet dragon, using mystical arts to bypass its Anti-Skill, and sent the girl into a mindless rampage of unbridled rage. The power the Dragon Princess proved to be too much for Jahil to handle and he once again perished as the capital of the elven empire was reduced to nothing by a bright beam of pure destruction. We all know what happened next. Milim became a Demon Lord and to calm her down, Ramiris was affected by her Magicules and became Demon Lord too. Thus, all three Ancient Demon Lords were ultimately created due to the foolishness of a single human. Her Pet Dragon gained the Blessings of the Harvest Festival and was revived but it lost its sanity due to the process and came to be known as… the infamous Chaos Dragon.”</p><p><br></p><p>I tightened my hug and she didn’t resist. The Elves on the other hand were radiating magicules in anger.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is he dead?” Sylvia asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Excuse me?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Jahil, is he dead?” She questioned Rimuru again.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone, all the Elves and Milim especially paid attention to this.</p><p><br></p><p>“No.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Where is he?” Milim asked first. The Elves were a close second to ask.</p><p><br></p><p>“Listen to the whole story first. You will know.” Rimuru said and then continued. “Kagali, Devastated by the loss of the maidservants and the knights who loved her and desperate to see them again, Kagali used the forbidden spell \"Birthday\". The result was the creation of three beautiful Deathmen: Clayman, Footman and Tear.”</p><p><br></p><p>Several people looked blank at the revelation and Rimuru went on.</p><p><br></p><p>“These individuals were specifically engineered in order to give them unique traits, where Clayman was engineered to specifically become a Demon Lord while Footman and Tear had formidable combat prowess to make them a match against a Demon Lord.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So Clayman and the rest were… I see.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Kagali, as the last remaining Elven Royalty tried to reestablish her Kingdom but the Chaos Dragon passed through the area and her people were corrupted by the Miasma, becoming Dark Elves. She used the knowledge of her previous Kingdom and reinvented several technologies, finally establishing the Puppet Nation Jistav on the ruins of her Fallen Kingdom. During this time, she met Sairon Grimwald on the verge of death.”</p><p><br></p><p>The atmosphere stagnated all of a sudden at the unexpected name. Sylvia’s gaze was boring through Rimuru at this point, as if daring her to stop.</p><p><br></p><p>Olga on the other hand looked as if she would go into a nervous breakdown.</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t stop either and went on with the story. “Kagali, who had been observing his battle, offered him the choice of being reborn, but warned him that he would not only become her puppet but would also lose his memories. Sarion agreed, firmly believing he would never forget his memories and his wife Sylvia. With the negotiations concluded, Kagali used the spell, but due to her inexperience, Sarion was reborn as a Deathman but lost all his memories. From there he was given a new name and identity; Laplace, the Wonder Pierrot.” She looked at Sylvia and apologised. “I am sorry for your loss.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Is he?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alive, in a way, yes. He just isn’t the same person as before.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Is there a way to bring his memories back, mother?” The Empress asked her but she shook her head. “Necromancy is a dangerous art.”</p><p><br></p><p>Olga looked down because she was probably the most knowledgeable about this and then she looked at me. “Is there really no way, Master?”</p><p><br></p><p>I closed my eyes and asked Solomon for advice. <em>“Any ideas Sol? Can we do anything for her?”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“There is a possibility although the chance will be very low. If the Host can absorb the Magicules from the Deathman Laplace, it can be used to reconstruct the memories of the deceased Sarion.”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“Wait, you can reconstruct the memories from Magicules?”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“Creation is a function of mine.”</em></p><p><br></p><p>Oh yes. Solomon was made from Astarte and Raphael. The Lord of Creation, Astarte’s main function was to create things. Recreating memories should technically be possible.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“How long would it take?”</em> I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>The reconstruction will depend on how much of the source we can obtain. If we could obtain his core, the reconstruction will be much faster or it could take a lot of time. It will also depend on the strength of the Host.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>I see. Wait. Can’t you reconstruct some of Veldanava’s memories from the Magicules I obtained from the Chaos Dragon?Just make sure you only get the memories and no personalities.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>The reconstruction is possible but as the Chaos Dragon was already corrupted and was merely a small fragment of the Star Dragon King and the Host only obtained some of its magicules instead of the core itself. The reconstruction process will take a long time at the Host’s current strength.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p><em>“How long?”</em></p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Twelve years.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p><em>“I see. Do it then.”</em></p><p><br></p><p>There would be a chance to get back home if I could reconstruct his memories. Twelve years are nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>“Master?”</p><p><br></p><p>My thoughts were interrupted by Olga’s voice and I realised that I still hadn’t answered her question.</p><p><br></p><p>“It is possible although the chances are very low. If we can get the Nucleic Core of Laplace, there is a chance I can reconstruct the memories. I cannot guarantee anything though.” I answered them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Really? You can do that?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It is not outside the realm of possibilities. True Heroes like Sarion are Spiritual Beings. Their existence is more or less imprinted on Spiritrons. These Spiritrons are contained mainly inside the core of a being. I think you all use a similar magic to create a homunculus body and transfer some of your magicules to bestow it with your memories when you have to go out of your country for meetings, right?” I asked the Elves who suddenly had a look of realisation on their faces. “There is a small chance that the Spiritrons inside his core might still have some fragments of his memories which I could use.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So it is possible.” Olga looked relieved. You have too much trust in me girl.</p><p><br></p><p>“But do not misunderstand, it is an incredibly risky process and the chances of success are incredibly low too. I cannot and will not do it without your permission.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do it.” Sylvia answered firmly. “My husband is dead. If there is a chance to get him back, I will take it. As for the core, I will get it even if we have to mobilise all the resources of the Sorcerer Dynasty of Sarion to get it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I promise you eternal friendship of Sorcerer Dynasty of Sarion if you can keep your word of restoring my Father’s memories.” The Empress also spoke.</p><p><br></p><p>Really hope you can do it, Sol.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will try my best.” I promised them.</p><p><br></p><p>With this part done, Rimuru continued with her story. “Kagali or Demon Lord Kazelim’s story is known to most of you so I won’t bore you all with it. After her fight with Roy Valentine, a rule was made that any altercations between Demon Lords will be solved by a majority vote. She used this to induct new Demon Lords into the council in a hope to control the vote. After bringing in Carrion and Clayman, Leon was supposed to be next but as we all know, Leon went and killed her. Her spirit however lived and roamed the world for hundreds of years while Clayman, her puppet, took over the country of Jistav.”</p><p><br></p><p>They nodded at this information. This was basically common news to all these people.</p><p><br></p><p>“It was only until 10 years ago that she successfully possessed and shared the body with an Otherworlder, Yuuki Kagurazaka, and from there she acquired the current female elf Homunculus body. Grateful for Yuuki's help, despite originally having tried to snatch his body, she began working closely together with him to reach their shared goals, and took on the identity of Kagali, Yuuki's secretary.” She turned towards Hinata, “So you see, you were being manipulated from the very start.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What is your proof?” She asked, not blindly believing.</p><p><br></p><p>A good quality if I do say so myself. “Your body has a parasite which has Yuuki’s Magicules. He can use it to temporarily control you.” I said and almost instantly Luminous stood up and walked up to her, placing a hand on her chest. And then on her waist, tearing off a piece of her flesh and healing the wound.</p><p><br></p><p>She showed everyone the parasite.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t kill it.” I stopped her before she could crush the bug. “He will find out about it. Just isolate it and tell her to carry it along with her till we catch him. You people have no idea about Yuuki Kagurazaka. What he shows to the world is not even a part of what he can do. I have called him to my coronation ceremony. We can catch him there. Don’t alert him before that.” I explained. “We need to capture them all at once or it will be nigh impossible to capture them all. For this very reason, I didn’t go directly to the Freedom Guild and grab Yuuki by force. He will not have many of his cards while he is here.”</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t know about others but Luminous was going to tear him a new one when they meet next time.</p><p><br></p><p>“The story is still left.” At the reminder, they all looked at Rimuru who continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“You see when Jahil died for the second time, His spirit once more roamed the earth, treading the line between life and death before being unexpectedly saved by the angel of origin Feldway. Feldway safe-guarded Jahil's spirit and Jahil in turn owed them a great debt. When the time came, Jahil's spirit was secretly implanted into the body of Footman in order to spy on the demon lord Clayman and his compatriots. There was also the fact that Clayman was being brainwashed the entire time by the Easter Empire’s Tatsuya Kondo.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What?” Several people reacted sharply at the unexpected bomb thrown there.</p><p><br></p><p>“The Emperor of the Eastern Empire wants to conquer the whole world. I think we all know this fact. He used the trade with Jistav and ordered his subordinate Tatsuya Kondo to use his Ultimate Skill to brainwash Clayman to cause trouble in the Jura Forest so that he could then enter and conquer the place easily. There was too much evidence for this too. His actions were too unlike him during his last days.” Rimuru then went on to list down the clues.</p><p><br></p><p>“He did seem different from his usual self to be honest.” Ramiris claimed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Still, this complicates matters too much. If the Eastern Empire is involved. Even as we are now, we cannot fight against them.\" Erland said, looking worried for the first time.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Their armies are the strongest in the world, matched only by those against Guy Crimson. We can at best resist them. Even their Guardian is a True Dragon, Velzard and their Emperor Rudra. Even with our Alliance, the current us, cannot defeat them.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Not to mention that if Rudra goes crazy, he could release Armageddon on us.</p><p><br></p><p>\"So you know about anyone else from the Eastern Empire acting as a spy?\" Gazel asked.</p><p><br></p><p>\"The Cerberus Organisation has the former Prime Minister of the Eastern Empire at its head along with two other people selected by him. Yuuki and him have been collaborating with each other for a while now. In fact, even the Falmuth Nation was incited by him to attack Tempest and help Clayman.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I have heard about them. Cerberus mostly deals with the Slave Trade and intelligence business.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Hinata looked a bit hesitant but spoke nonetheless. \"He had approached me with the news about Shizue Sensei's death at the hands of Rimuru Tempest.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Erland looked at her. \"You were students with Yuuki Kagurazaka so you should know how strong he is, right?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I… don't know for sure now. He has a special constitution which suppresses all Skills and Magic coming in contact with him. Aside from this, he cannot use any Skills but he is extremely strong physically.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Then they turned in my direction for information. \"Yuuki was summoned to this world with a Unique Skill which allowed him to create Skills as long as he had enough power. The first one he created was Anti-Skill, the Skill possessed by the Chaos Dragon. It's not like he doesn't have Skills, you just cannot sense them. As for how strong he is, the guy has created a Skill which can turn him into a Spiritual Lifeform anytime he wants to, so you are fighting a Saint. If all his physical strength were to be converted to energy, he would match Leon in terms of brute power.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Many of their faces blanched at the reveal.</p><p><br></p><p>\"So, what is the plan for them?\" </p><p><br></p><p>\"We nab them when they come here for my coronation. Although you have to be careful, Kagali will be with him and she could have Footman, Tear and Laplace at their command. We need to make sure they cannot run away and then attract Laplace here so we can extract his core.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Over the rest of the night, we discussed what to do to keep the Eastern Empire away from us.</p><p><br></p><p>Luminous, in a rare show of generosity, offered Hinata to train my new recruits. The Elves offered funding to build my forces and Gazel offered builders.</p><p><br></p><p>I started more research on the skill which Yuuki could use to become a Saint. Technically, with the help of Solomon, I could do it much more easily.</p><p><br></p><p>Currently, Shiro and Masaomi were both Enlightened and several of Hinata's subordinates were also the same. In fact, she herself was only an Enlightened and not a Saint.</p><p><br></p><p>It's just that Luminous had traitors among her people and I didn't want to empower her forces until we were in a stronger alliance.</p><p><br></p><p>We did give everyone the information but it didn't mean that they would believe everything we say without any evidence. They ran countries of their own, not welfare societies or friends clubs.</p><p><br></p><p>That's why we made such a great show in the meeting, so that everyone gets involved in the mess for their own reasons.</p><p><br></p><p>We cannot fight the Eastern Empire on our own if they decided to attack us. The Butterfly Effect was a thing after all. Not to mention the livelihoods of the people of my country.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Do you think they will take the bait?\"  As I finally got a break, Rimuru asked me.</p><p><br></p><p>\"The bait we threw was too personal for them to not bite. We just need to wait till Yuuki is captured.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"But what about Feldway and Rudra?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Nothing.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Huh?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Since we cannot do anything against them at this moment, we do nothing. Concentrate on getting stronger now.”</p><p><br></p><p>I knew that we had become stronger but compared to the power of those monsters, we were still far away.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly, I turned towards her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you for everything, Rimuru.”</p><p><br></p><p>A smile formed on her lips. “I am enjoying this too so you don’t have to thank me. But if you want something then…”</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t wait for her words and leaned forward. Her eyes widened as our lips met. She didn’t stay in shock for long as her hands slipped around me and pulled me in for another kiss.</p><p><br></p><p>During all these days, I found us very compatible. We got along with each other. Hell, we even had a soul corridor between each other, one of the highest types of bond people can have in this world. It increased our understanding of each other by a lot.</p><p><br></p><p>Also, I was not an idiot. I knew that she was interested in me and to be honest I was also interested in her. She was kind, funny and a bit crazy but during the last month or so, I had come to like her as she was. Today was just the day I took the final step. And it seems that the result was positive as well.</p><p><br></p><p>She pushed me down a bit and leaned into me as we deepened our kiss even more.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Luminous Valentine -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The visit to Camelot was not as she had expected. So many revelations, so many conspiracies which shook everyone’s world. Now she understood why Chronoa called him ‘The Man who knew Everything’.</p><p><br></p><p>Such a terrifying power for anyone to have.</p><p><br></p><p>But then again, it was probably for the best that someone like him had this power instead of someone like say, Clayman or Rudra… or that Jahil.</p><p><br></p><p>She did get the advantage of this power so she had nothing to complain about. She will go out to investigate the spies and traitors in her own kingdom when she returns. Not to mention… She looked out of her window, at the children playing with each other.</p><p><br></p><p>Chloe O’ Bell.</p><p><br></p><p>No wonder he wasn’t worried at all.</p><p><br></p><p>She was here with him from the start.</p><p><br></p><p>Luminous took advantage of the week before the coronation to get to know her. The Saviour of her country and her close friend as a child. In fact, all of his students were talented. And then there was Aletia, a royal vampire.</p><p><br></p><p>She was able to talk to her in the past few days and found herself sympathising with the girl. She rejected her offer to join the Holy Kingdom because she wanted to repay that man and find a way back home to save her people.</p><p><br></p><p>As a ruler of her people, Luminous found herself respecting the girl even more because of this. She will ask some of her loyal followers to search for people with Skills and Magic specialising in World Travel and Summoning Magic so as to assist Aletia and her friends in finding a way back home.</p><p><br></p><p>But all of that will come after the coronation. The hidden Danger to the continent needs to be removed. Especially Yuuki Kagaruzaka.</p><p><br></p><p>How dare that cretin put something like that inside her Hinata’s body?</p><p><br></p><p>She will make sure that his death is painful.</p><p><br></p><p>Not to mention that Damrada who planned to lure Hinata away. She had confided in her that the merchant she thought to be the simple guy had tried to lure her away during the Walpurgis.</p><p><br></p><p>Roy had investigated and found that Cerberus Organisation indeed had a head called Damrada of the Gold who looked quite similar to the merchant who met Hinata. All of this along with the parasites were more than enough to confirm the news. But he still gave her more. Granbel Rosso… will the Luminary of the Sun really disappoint her?</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Guy Crimson -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“You want a place to live because Dagruel threw you out?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. The guy became active all of a sudden. Can I crash here please?” The Sleeping Ruler asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Guy thought of something and a smile formed on his face.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have a suggestion for you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Recently, I have come across a recruitment offer put in by a certain Hero.” Guy smiled as he saw Dino’s eyes widen lightly.</p><p><br></p><p>The Walpurgis had been shocking for many. Even Velzard had hardly spoken since she returned back.</p><p><br></p><p>If the birth of a new True Dragon was enough to attract her to the Walpurgis, then what she encountered there was completely beyond her expectations. She didn’t even talk to the man during the Walpurgis, unsure of how to act.</p><p><br></p><p>And the only other person who was just as affected as her was probably standing in front of him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Salvatore is being crowned as the King of a certain Kingdom and he is hiring people. Ramiris is there too. If you go there, you could find a place to stay. I am sure neither him nor Rimuru would deny a friend.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man was too interesting for Guy to leave alone but if he really was who Guy thought he was… then he didn’t want to interfere till he grew back to full power.</p><p><br></p><p>And so, he decided to send someone who knew Veldanava the most in the world, his most trustworthy general, former Seraphim Dino. Even the two followers of Dino were Seraphim before their fall and were created directly by Veldanava. If he was a fake, Dino won’t fall for it and Guy might get a good opponent. Someone who can match Milim, even barely, would easily grow into someone worthy of his attention. Not to mention, having someone keep an eye on the new True Dragon would always be good anyways.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, if he truly was <em>him</em>… Guy couldn’t stop the grin on his face from appearing.</p><p><br></p><p>Especially considering, Rudra was involved with Clayman’s schemes.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x__________________________________________________________________x_________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><strong>This chapter contained a bit of an infodump but I wanted to write this for many who didn’t know about the core history of the Tensura world.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I thought it would be easier for people to understand the actions of Sal and Rimuru going forward with this.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>We got to see the otaku character of Rimuru and her plan to make herself a personal Arthur Pendragon.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>As for the Elves and Luminous, they were just baited bad.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Anyways, the plans are in line.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sal and the team have set their trap.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>All they need is for the prey to fall into their trap.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Yuuki won’t even know what hit him.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>We start abusing the rest of the meta from the next chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br></p>",

Shizue-san told me to take care of her most troublesome student. I am just doing this for her.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"... I see. Yes. It's just like her to think about others even at such times.\"</p><p><br></p><p>A period of silence settled over the room.</p><p><br></p><p>\"How are you now?\" She asked, changing the subject.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Waking up to such a cute girl. I am more than okay.\"</p><p><br></p><p>She blushed a little but collected herself back soon. \"Did you get a silver tongue Skill during evolution?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I think it has always been my Intrinsic Skill.\" I joked.</p><p><br></p><p>Both of us burst into laughs.</p><p><br></p><p>“And you have a Dragon’s Core? You are the genuine Arthur Pendragon, aren’t you? Blonde, green eyes, Holy Sword and now a Dragon’s Core.”</p><p><br></p><p>That was an odd comparison. But somehow I couldn’t refute it.</p><p><br></p><p>“All you need is your own kingdom now and we can manage it.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“You were being serious about that?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Totes. The kingdom will be in chaos if there is no king. There could be a Civil War or foreign attack which can be prevented if you are the King. Someone who can kick the ass of Hero Hinata will be supported by everyone. And if someone greedy becomes a King then they can try something stupid again. Rather not take any risks. You said you wanted to gather resources to get back home. Getting more people would be good.”</p><p><br></p><p>It was reasonable and I was actually considering the possibility.</p><p><br></p><p>She left after checking up on me. She had to do something. Before leaving, she told me that her Skill had analysed Uriel. I just shrugged because it was originally supposed to be hers. If not for her, I would have likely been screwed today.</p><p><br></p><p>My Leviathan Skill was too dangerous if I let it be.</p><p><br></p><p>I need to learn to control it better.</p><p><br></p><p><em>'Affirmative</em>.'</p><p><br></p><p>… what?</p><p><br></p><p><em>'The Ultimate Skill will be restricted according to the Host's will</em>.'</p><p><br></p><p>I just stood there l, mouth open wide as the voice in my head sounded.</p><p><br></p><p>Just what the fuck happened while I was unconscious?</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next hour or so, my new Skill explained to me about how Leviathan had gone all out and copied everything from Rimuru. Meanwhile a Soul Corridor was opened between us to ease the burden on my soul.</p><p><br></p><p>That's… she was really too trusting to agree to something like a Soul Corridor. I didn't even know what to say.</p><p><br></p><p>Uriel was very important for Rimuru from what I could remember. It didn't matter if she copied this or any other of my Skills. After all, I got more than I could ask for.</p><p><br></p><p>While Raphael only worked at 1% of its full power, it was still an Ultimate Skill and it made the work of maintaining the rest of my Skills much more easier than before.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Guy Crimson -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“This is rare. Since when did you come out of your little hole, you shut-in pixie?” He asked as Ramiris flew around the bunch of food. Really, in her pixie form, she behaved like an overexcited insect. There wasn’t even a hint of the Queen of the Spirits.</p><p><br></p><p>Velzard sat at one corner of the table watching her antics.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh Guy, you are here.” Holding a grape the size of her head, she turned back to look at him. She flew right to his face. “What’s up with the sudden Walpurgis? And why exactly is Rimuru being targeted?”</p><p><br></p><p>“How would I know? It was called by Clayman and Frey and Milim signed it. You know this Rimuru guy?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm Rimuru is my friend. Also she is a girl. But why did Milim ask for the Walpurgis against Rimuru? She is also friends with Rimuru. Not to mention that Milim was about to beat up Clayma… Oops.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hoh… what’s this about Milim about to beat up Clayman?”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“W-what are you talking about? I didn't say anything.” She looked the other way, trying to avoid his eyes. “These grapes are quite good.”</p><p><br></p><p>Guy, not in the mood to let it go, grabbed her by the wing and made her face him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let me go! I will fight back, you know. Punch, kick, punch punch punch.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So what’s this about Milim and Clayman? I don’t recall Clayman trying to poke Milim. Not to mention, he wouldn’t be strong enough to do anything to her either. So, what did he do to piss Milim?” He asked with a little bit of his Haki leaking out.</p><p><br></p><p>“Clayman was planning against Rimuru and he also tried to plot against Sal to make him into a Demon Lord forcibly. Mililm was angry enough to kill him right then but she wanted to expose him first.” Ramiris uttered as fast as she could.</p><p><br></p><p>He let her down on the dining table in front of him as she stretched and caressed her wings before flying up again.</p><p><br></p><p>“That was rude, you know.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Rimuru, I understand but who is this Sal? And what would make Milim want to kill Clayman over him?”</p><p><br></p><p>Here Ramiris’ face took on an unexpectedly serious look. “Salvatore is a Dragonoid.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“You can make jokes now. How nice.” He laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing her not moving even a bit he stopped suddenly. “Seriously?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p><br></p><p>Velzard’s aura rose. “Does my dear sister want to die so badly? She could have asked me. Why does she need to do something like that? And Rudra, has he finally gone insane?” She spoke through gritted teeth before using her Universal Sense and pausing. “Velgrynd is alright. Is it… was that why we couldn’t sense him for a while?That stupid brat.”</p><p><br></p><p>Did Veldora go and have a child?</p><p><br></p><p>This was shocking even for Guy.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh, eh? What? Who are you talking about?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Veldora. This Salvatore is Veldora’s child? Who is the mother?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Veldora? Where did Veldora come from? Sal is Sal, you know. Veldora has nothing to do with him.”</p><p><br></p><p>This made both of them pause and look weirdly.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s like this…” Ramiris explained.</p><p><br></p><p>An hour or so later, there was silence in the whole room.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are sure that he was a Dragonoid.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Very sure. Milim checked too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And that a True Dragon was being awakened within his soul.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umu.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A completely new True Dragon.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yup.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And Clayman somehow knew about him, tried to make him go into an outrage but Milim stopped it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes yes. That liar even called my territory his own to attack Sal.” Ramiris stood up, looking outraged.</p><p><br></p><p>He exchanged a look with Velzard and then both turned back at Ramiris. “Tell us more about this boy.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sal is a very good boy. I am even thinking of taking him as a minion hahahaha. The children he teaches are staying with me while he travels the world.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ramiris went on to explain whatever she knew about him.</p><p><br></p><p>An otherworlder, with the soul of a True Dragon attached to him. Veldanava had created thousands of worlds. It was not out of the realm of possibility for a True Dragon to be born in one of them.</p><p><br></p><p>But still, a new dragonoid…</p><p><br></p><p>And everything seemed to be tied together.</p><p><br></p><p>Ramiris left after a while but he still kept thinking.</p><p><br></p><p>“What do you think, Velzard?”</p><p><br></p><p>“If Clayman is really planning this, he will die.” She answered. Her voice, frostier than usual.</p><p><br></p><p>Already protective of her new sibling.</p><p><br></p><p>“That he will. He has angered many people. But Clayman is a small fish. He can’t do something like this. At least not by himself. So who… Rudra? No… he wouldn’t cross certain lines no matter what. So, was it just a coincidence and he discovered Salvatore by chance. How can there be such a coincidence?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ramiris did mention some Shizue Izawa. From what I seem to remember, she was related to Leon.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh. That’s a clue. Leon was about to visit us too. I take it that you will be attending the Walpurgis with us?” She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>Anyways, the Walpurgis this time around just became infinitely more interesting.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Salvatore -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I sat at the corner of the room looking at the crowd that had gathered around us.</p><p><br></p><p>A meeting to discuss the future of Tempest.</p><p><br></p><p>“So this is Veldora Tempest?” The Dwarf, Gazel Dwargo asked, looking at the dragon who was reading manga behind me. We surprisingly got along well.</p><p><br></p><p>He was interested in the dragon within my soul. Apparently there were no new True Dragons born for thousands of years so it was a surprise that one was born.</p><p><br></p><p>Not to mention, even me being a Dragonoid was a surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>Somehow due to the magicules from Vritra and Veldora, my own Dragon Core was strengthened. It was still not enough to bear the burden of the Skills but at least things were easier now.</p><p><br></p><p>I needed to hatch the Hero’s Egg to support all my Skills.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.” Rimuru answered.</p><p><br></p><p>The people in the room looked with open mouths at the dragon which was known to wreck countries for a morning exercise, quietly reading manga on the couch.</p><p><br></p><p>“Rimuru-dono, can we have a moment of your private time, please?” Both the Dwarf and the Elf jumped urgently.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes?”</p><p><br></p><p>The break didn’t take long and when they returned, they seemed very subdued.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru explained everything about herself, the reincarnation, the attack of Farmuth Kingdom, etc.</p><p><br></p><p>“You fought that Hinata Sakaguchi?” The Elf leader, Erald Grimwald exclaimed.</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded. “Yes. She was strong, almost like a cold blooded killer. If not for Sal, I might have lost the fight.”</p><p><br></p><p>The people looked confused. “Sal?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, Sal means Salvatore, my friend. Here.”</p><p><br></p><p>The guildmaster from the Burmund Kingdom looked in thought then his eyes widened, “Salvatore. Are you perhaps that Salvatore, the student of Shizue Izawa? Salvatore of the White Blade?”</p><p><br></p><p>The what of the what?</p><p><br></p><p>“I am a student of Shizue Izawa but I don’t know the title you just spoke of.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously. We only recently got the news about a newly ascended Saint who destroyed Slave Traders in the Kingdom of Ballachia and saved hundreds of people. Your name is being spread everywhere right now. You are quite famous as the youngest Saint in history. There has never been a Saint younger than you.”</p><p><br></p><p>That’s quite surprising.</p><p><br></p><p>“May I ask how you two know each other?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Rimuru was a friend of my Teacher. Not to mention, we are from the same world.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, I see. This is indeed surprising.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But Rimuru-dono, from my information, Hinata Sakaguchi is quite different. She is known to help those in need and is never cruel to anyone. If I had to take a guess, I would say that it would be because of the policy of the Western Holy Church which doesn’t allow anyone to make deals with monsters. Especially with Veldora-dono.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It wasn’t anything of that sort. Hinata was given wrong information that Rimuru had killed our teacher. In fact, even I was given the same information by someone. I cleared the matter with her and there should be no problem. As for the Western Church, they will probably let go of Rimuru. As for Veldora, that’s a whole other can of worms.”</p><p><br></p><p>‘You know something?’ Rimuru asked me through our mental connection.</p><p><br></p><p>We shared a mental connection between us since the opening of the Soul Corridor. Veldora, Rimuru and I can talk with each other regardless of the distance between us.</p><p><br></p><p>‘A bit, yes. I might know their God only by identity.’</p><p><br></p><p>‘Their God? Who?’ Veldora perked up.</p><p><br></p><p>‘I am not one hundred percent sure. I will need to investigate a bit first.’</p><p><br></p><p>‘Alright.’</p><p><br></p><p>This was like having a chat group in my head.</p><p><br></p><p>“But if she is really that helpful, then why didn’t she stop the summoning of children from other worlds? Someone of her power and influence could surely do much.” Rimuru questioned.</p><p><br></p><p>“... actually, Summoning Otherworlders is banned in the Western Countries. It’s just that no one accepts it. We cannot do anything if they don’t.” Erland explained.</p><p><br></p><p>I raised my hand. “I was summoned by the Falmuth Nation at the age of fourteen and kept under a lock spell for two years. I was only able to escape through a massive stroke of luck. But that aside, tell me something, when have you seen a criminal accept the crimes first hand?”</p><p><br></p><p>A silver haired guy, Youm I think his name was, came to the front and bowed deeply. “I apologise for the actions of my countrymen. But please believe me, not everyone is like that.”</p><p><br></p><p>I waved it off. “Don’t worry about it. I know who is responsible for it. They have already paid for that. I don’t intend to do anything to the country. I am not a psychopath, you know.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes yes, Sal is a Hero. A genuine Hero like Hinata Sakaguchi. How could he do those kinds of things?” Rimuru spoke.</p><p><br></p><p>“A Hero? My, that's news.” Erland spoke up. “I represent the Sorcerer's Dynasty of Sarion to congratulate you on becoming a Hero, Mr. Salvatore. I would like to invite you to be our guests sometime.”</p><p><br></p><p>The elves were quite respectful to Heroes as they were blessed by the Spirits and they were descended from the Spirits.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will be honoured.” I bowed.</p><p><br></p><p>At this time, Youm bowed again. “Sir Salvatore, please, save the Falmuth Kingdom.”</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru smirked.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>____________________________________x_________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>The plan was quite easy.</p><p><br></p><p>I was to pretend to fight Rimuru who comes to seek retribution and save Falmuth Kingdom. Then we’ll sign a treaty with each other.</p><p><br></p><p>Youm will use this to bring his supporters to back me up as the new King.</p><p><br></p><p>They wanted my title of a Hero to protect the kingdom from attackers.</p><p><br></p><p>It was understandable but still weird.</p><p><br></p><p>The real surprise was when Erland came to visit me later. He saw Olga and was frozen in shock. What came later surprised the fuck out of everyone, including me.</p><p><br></p><p>Olga Discordia, formerly known as Sara Grimwald was the former princess of the Sorcerer Nation Sarion and the younger sister of Sarion Grimwald, the former Elven Hero and the father of the current Emperor.</p><p><br></p><p>‘You named the aunt of the Emperor of Elves after an Eroge character.’ Rimuru’s voice sounded in my head.</p><p><br></p><p>‘I named her after a royal.’ I replied, unphased.</p><p><br></p><p>And Erland was a bigshot himself. The uncle of the Emperor which made him Olga’s brother. He asked her to return with them but she denied.</p><p><br></p><p>She was ashamed to have been the only one to survive in the battle.</p><p><br></p><p>‘Should have named her Shirou Emiya?’ Rimuru spoke.</p><p><br></p><p>‘Right?’ I couldn’t retort to the comment. It was quite apt.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy took the opportunity to contact the Emperor and they had a talk among themselves. Finally, due to her insistence, it was decided that she will stay with me and when I become the king, she will act as the Royal Ambassador of the Sorcerer Nation of Sarion to my new Kingdom.</p><p><br></p><p>Gazel Dwargo found out about this and sent his own people to support me as well.</p><p><br></p><p>‘Those two seemed quite close.’ Rimuru asked me.</p><p><br></p><p>‘They are actually descendants of a Wind Spirit and an Earth Spirit and go well back.’</p><p><br></p><p>‘Oh, how do you know all of this?’</p><p><br></p><p>‘I bribed Ramiris with candies and asked her to tell me some stories about the world. She was a very good source of knowledge. With how she usually behaves, it is easy to forget that she is one of the oldest beings in this world, older than even Veldora.’</p><p><br></p><p>‘Ramiris! Oh yes, she is older than me.’ Veldora joined on hearing his name called and then went back to read.</p><p><br></p><p>And speak of the Devil.</p><p><br></p><p>Ramiris arrived at Tempest at that very moment.</p><p><br></p><p>She told us about the Walpurgis.</p><p><br></p><p>What exactly was Milim thinking?</p><p><br></p><p>She never told us about the plan. But maybe she was planning to expose Clayman at the Walpurgis.</p><p><br></p><p>But destroying the Beast Nation Eurazania didn’t make sense.</p><p><br></p><p>Overnight plans were made. Rimuru will be going to the Walpurgis while I will go and face the army of Jistav who are planning on attacking Eurazania.</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“Who are those people?” I asked Benimaru who was acting as the Vice Commander.</p><p><br></p><p>“They are the followers of Milim-sama. They are called the Dragon Faithfuls. Right now they are backing up Clayman’s army.” He answered with some hesitation.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t hurt them. They are just participating in this due to Milim’s whims. I don’t think they will try to kill us either.”</p><p><br></p><p>“As you command.”</p><p><br></p><p>It was at this time that I felt several presences appearing on the other end of the army.</p><p><br></p><p>Five people. All at the level of Sages or High level Majin.</p><p><br></p><p>Raphael revealed that they were under the Heart Seal and the Lock Spell.</p><p><br></p><p>It must be them. The Hidden Hand. The team of otherworlders.</p><p><br></p><p>“Benimaru, take command. I will take care of them. Do not interfere. They are under control.” I commanded as I jumped towards the army.</p><p><br></p><p>The five had started fighting.</p><p><br></p><p>The two men seemed to be priests. The brown haired girl was…using hand signs. Ninja? The other two were a demon and vampire?</p><p><br></p><p>I noticed that they were trying not to harm anyone when fighting but when they did, it seemed quite forced.</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah. They didn't want to fight either.</p><p><br></p><p>I reached the area and the first thing I did was create a barrier around us.</p><p><br></p><p>The older of the men looked at me and shouted for me to run away. Almost confirmed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you being forced to do this?” I asked as soon as the barrier was completed.</p><p><br></p><p>They were taken aback by the sudden question.</p><p><br></p><p>“I was in contact with one of his subordinates under the same circumstances. I can remove your bindings but you have to stop attacking us.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Wait. Rin-chan had her heart destroyed. If you remove the spell, she will die.” The white haired woman interrupted me.</p><p><br></p><p>“It will not hurt her.” I brought out a Full Restore Potion from my pocket. “I can get her organs back.”</p><p><br></p><p>They nodded and the very next moment, I used my Negation Zone to remove their bindings.</p><p><br></p><p>It was probably the most anti-climactic battle of all.</p><p><br></p><p>The enemy lost all their main fighters in one go and had them turned against them.</p><p><br></p><p>“We will assist the others.” The old man at the lead told me and I agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Keep to one area so there is no confusion.” I commanded as I headed towards a different direction to assist others.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Footman -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Dammit. It’s that cursed Skill of his again. The operation is going to fail like this. We need to use that plan.”</p><p><br></p><p>He rushed to the location of the seal and proceeded to break the seal while Tear kept the others occupied.</p><p><br></p><p>A heavy rush of magicules covered the area.</p><p><br></p><p>“Crap that’s strong. Well they will die at least. Annoying pests.” He ran away from the area as a loud roar resounded through the area. Tear followed him.</p><p><br></p><p>This was one of the reasons why they chose this area for the battle so that if everything went awry, they could just kill off every living being and collect all their souls.</p><p><br></p><p>Progenitor of all Dragons except the True Dragons, the Chaos Dragon.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Salvatore -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I sat down and relaxed as the battle ended quickly since the enemy lost their strongest members very quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>The five members helped a lot too.</p><p><br></p><p>It’s just that I had a very weird feeling when I was watching them fight.</p><p><br></p><p>Especially that ninja girl.</p><p><br></p><p>The techniques she was using. They were ninjutsu and were extremely familiar. In fact she even used what seemed like Medical Ninjutsu.</p><p><br></p><p>Two purple marks on her cheeks, brown hair, a heart injury…</p><p><br></p><p>It couldn’t be right.</p><p><br></p><p>There was no way right.</p><p><br></p><p>Of all people in infinite worlds, another one of those…</p><p><br></p><p>So when everyone returned, I introduced myself.</p><p><br></p><p>“Your name sounds Italian.” The old man said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I am from Italy. Are you from Earth? You look like a Japanese. Even your accent. Are you a priest? No, an exorcist?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha yes. My name is Shiro Fujimoto. I am both a priest and an exorcist, a Paladin to be exact. You’ve heard of them?” He laughed as she sat on the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am sorry but I haven’t heard this exact term among the exorcists I know. As for knowing exorcists, I was raised in a Church funded Orphanage along with my brother.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiro Fujimoto.</p><p><br></p><p>The name sounded familiar somehow.</p><p><br></p><p>Raphael was quick to jump in with the memory.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>That makes it three maybe.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at others.</p><p><br></p><p>The black haired man bowed lightly, “Masaomi Yaegaki, Priest of the Vatican and this is Cleria Belial, my lover. She is a devil.” He paused a bit at the reveal.</p><p><br></p><p>I merely raised an eyebrow. “Are you worried about my opinion? This army belongs to my friend Demon Lord Rimuru Tempest. She is a reincarnator from Japan. Several of my subordinates are monsters and Daemons. I don’t mind.”</p><p><br></p><p>He relaxed visibly at my answer. “Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>I just waved it off.</p><p><br></p><p>The brown haired girl was next. “Rin Nohara.”</p><p><br></p><p>BULLSHIT.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Umm, is there a problem?\" She must have noticed the look on my face.</p><p><br></p><p>\"The student of Minato Namikaze and the teammate of Kakashi and Obito?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"You know them!\"</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>\"I…\"</p><p><br></p><p>The sudden roar both helped me escape from an awkward situation and also made me cuss at the feeling of Deja Vu.</p><p><br></p><p>Just how many Dragons are these idiots keeping?</p><p><br></p><p>The feeling which came next however was nothing like Charybdis.</p><p><br></p><p>It was strong. Enough to make even the current me shiver.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the distance and saw a huge black coloured dragon rise up in the air.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Back down. Everyone Retreat now. This is an order. Hurry, evacuate the area.\" I turned towards Benimaru. \"Take everyone out of this place. I will hold it back. Do not come near us. This is not a fight they will be able to participate in.\" I commanded before rushing to face it.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>– Middray –</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He felt his knees go weak as he saw the form of the dragon rising up in the sky.</p><p><br></p><p>It was supposed to be his ancestor. The progenitor of all the dragons in the world except the True Dragons, sealed by Lady Milim.</p><p><br></p><p>Who released the seal on the Chaos Dragon?</p><p><br></p><p>Another roar echoed through the area as it created several blasts of corrosive energy.</p><p><br></p><p>The soldiers were already retreating but they will still get caught up in this.</p><p><br></p><p>He was about to go back to stop a few blasts to give others a chance to escape but was stopped by the Oni known as Benimaru.</p><p><br></p><p>\"We are ordered to get back. You will only get in his way.\" He pointed towards Chaos Dragon's direction and he could see a figure running straight towards it at full speed.</p><p><br></p><p>A white sword appeared in his hands and he jumped and slashed towards it. A massive wall of flames intercepted the attack, stopping it in its way.</p><p><br></p><p>Still a big part of the attack was scattered towards the surroundings, destroying everything in its path.</p><p><br></p><p>“Who is he?” Middray asked Benimaru.</p><p><br></p><p>“He is a friend of Rimuru-sama and Lady Milim, Salvatore. Now please secure the retreat of the others.”</p><p><br></p><p>The evacuation was hastened while the fight heated up even more.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly another huge aura descended on the area. On looking close, Midday saw something which made his jaw drop to the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>“Middray-san, are you seeing what I am seeing?” Hermes asked from his side.</p><p><br></p><p>He just nodded dumbly.</p><p><br></p><p>A dragonoid.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Salvatore -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>This thing was like a fucking tank. All my spells were being dispersed. The only reason it was even in place was because of Uriel and Leviathan working together.</p><p><br></p><p>It had some kind of protection against magics and the miasma around it made it harder to fight it in melee.</p><p><br></p><p>I swung my sword once again to intercept another one of its attacks and tried to use Leviathan to weaken its defence before throwing in a few attacks.</p><p><br></p><p>Maintaining all my Skills while keeping it away from the army was hard. The stress on my body was only manageable due to using my dragonoid form.</p><p><br></p><p>Fighting it alone would have been much easier.</p><p><br></p><p>It swung its tail at me and I was able to pull up by sword to defend at the last moment but was still thrown away into a nearby mountain.</p><p><br></p><p>There was just too much difference in raw power.</p><p><br></p><p>I did have one Skill which could make up for it but I was not sure if I would be able to control myself once using that Skill so I needed to wait till the army was evacuated.</p><p><br></p><p>Almost an hour or so later, the place was evacuated and I let myself go.</p><p><br></p><p>‘Sataneel.’</p><p><br></p><p>My power increased quickly as magicules were being drained away just as fast but replenished very quickly. The stress on my body became higher than before. </p><p><br></p><p>I won’t be able to maintain this form for much longer in such a fight so I need to finish this quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>Keeping this thought in mind, I flew towards it once more and struck.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Olga -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She watched dumbstruck as her new Lord fought the monster which had ruined her life.</p><p><br></p><p>When the roar had sounded, she had frozen in her place. All those memories which she had forcibly suppressed came rushing back once more.</p><p><br></p><p>And then just like the last time, one figure rushed at it with a sword drawn.</p><p><br></p><p>The shockwaves of their clashes were destroying the area but she still stood there, waiting for the end of the battle. Along with her, there were other subordinates of her Master and Demon Lord Rimuru.</p><p><br></p><p>A while later a reddish aura surrounded him and the power she could feel from him also shot up outrageously.</p><p><br></p><p>The subordinates all made barriers to prevent being affected by the miasma. She could even control the miasma to some extent and diverted it in the other direction to secure this area.</p><p><br></p><p>It was however too late. The miasma had affected the dead bodies of the enemies laying on the ground and turned them into undead and they had to prepare for a fight.</p><p><br></p><p>“Everyone, brace in. Avoid their poison. Hold them back.” Benimaru took command.</p><p><br></p><p>The five people who were freed by her Master had also joined in to offer help.</p><p><br></p><p>The two men especially were quite adept in putting down the undead, using holy attacks and weaponry.</p><p><br></p><p>The brown haired girl was creating what looked like Corals to stop them in their tracks.</p><p><br></p><p>The vampire was using fire to purge them and wind to keep away the poison and miasma and finally the grey haired woman was somehow dispelling the effects on the undead altogether.</p><p><br></p><p>On the other side, the clashes between the Dragon and the Dragonoid got stronger.</p><p><br></p><p>Several times he was shot down but he again returned, even stronger than before, clashing with the Chaos Dragon without giving an inch..</p><p><br></p><p>The fight continued.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, with a loud roar, he shot towards it and smashed it to the ground with his sword. The Dragon gave a cry of pain but he didn’t stop and kept slashing like a man possessed. The holy flames on the sword became brighter and brighter until the entire barrier was covered in a white holy light and the roars slowly but very surely died down.</p><p><br></p><p>The barrier dispersed.</p><p><br></p><p>Her heart throbbed at the scene. The dragon which had been the source of nightmares for her had finally been slayed.</p><p><br></p><p>The undead having lost the source of the miasma were severely weakened and fell soon. The battle was over.</p><p><br></p><p>As she looked in the distance, one man sitting in the crater, tears welled up in her eyes but the next moment she felt the world shake around her and a voice resounded in the area.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>The individual Salvatore is undergoing an evolution. Beings associated with him will be given the Blessing of the Voice of the World.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Salvatore -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I lay on the ground, drained as I heard the Voice of the World sound.</p><p><br></p><p>Fighting the Chaos Dragon while preventing it from dying was hard. So I did the only thing which came to my mind. Purified the miasma with the Holy Flames and then used Leviathan to absorb all its magicules so as to not harm its core.</p><p><br></p><p>And now I was laying on the ground, catching a breath.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>The individual has completed a task of great ardour gaining the recognition of the world.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Initiating Evolution.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>The Hero’s Egg has matured and hatched.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Astarte is attempting to evolve to assist the host in the most efficient manner.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Astarte has sacrificed Raphael, Lord of Wisdom.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Ultimate Skill: Astarte has evolved into Ultimate Skill: Solomon, King of Wisdom.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Solomon is attempting to evolve the Unique Skill: Blessed One.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Process Successful.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Unique Skill: Blessed One has evolved into Unique Skill: Divine One.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>A large amount of Magicules was absorbed from Chaos Dragon.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Strengthening the Extra Skill: Dragon’s Core.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Extra Skill: Dragon’s Core has been strengthened.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>The body and soul can now bear the strain of more Ultimate Skills.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Restraint on Ultimate Skills removed.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Sataneel, Lord of Wrath can now be used at 80% of its full power.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>The evolution to a True Hero was successful.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>The souls associated with the Host will get the Blessing of the Voice of the World.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p>My strength had risen again. This was the biggest increase yet.</p><p><br></p><p>Just in terms of magicules, there was almost a twelve times increase. And considering how big my initial reserves were, it’s enormous.</p><p><br></p><p>One more gain was my sword. It was now a genuine God Ranked sword. It was used to channel my Ultimate Skills and Dragonic Power for a long time now and had finally upgraded to the God Grade.</p><p><br></p><p>It was partially because the Dragonoid side was strengthened due to Magicules which I absorbed from the Chaos Dragon’s core. It was not at Milim’s level yet but still far stronger than before. My entire body seemed to be strengthened.</p><p><br></p><p>The Chaos Dragon was strong. If Charybdis was a drop of water than this was an entire fucking bucket.</p><p><br></p><p>In terms of sheer magicules, it was above me. Its physical strength was above mine. Its stamina was above mine.</p><p><br></p><p>The only reason I was able to win was because of my Ultimate Skills.</p><p><br></p><p>I remember that it was related to Milim, her best friend or something. Man….she is going to be pissed. In fact even I was pissed knowing the story behind it.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- ??? -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>It could feel the changes going on within the body of its other half.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a seed of power which had grown into something larger.</p><p><br></p><p>The transformation to its being was hastened.</p><p><br></p><p>Soon, it could awaken and breathe in the world once more.</p><p><br></p><p>There were sounds echoing through its soul.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Solomon has used Unique Skill: Delete Field as a base, sacrificed Unique Skill: Black Blaze Flare, Unique Skill: Absorption Line, and Unique Skill: Shadow Prison.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>….</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Process Successful</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Unique Skill: Delete Field has evolved into Ultimate Skill: Ahi, Lord of Droughts.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>The Host will be awakened soon.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Rimuru Tempest -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Looking at the scene at the Walpurgis, she felt tense. Several Demon Lords were looking at her with different kinds of gazes.</p><p><br></p><p>There were several people who were as strong as her. Some are even stronger.</p><p><br></p><p>For example that white haired woman and the giant. She didn’t know who had more magicules, Veldora or them. All of them felt endless.</p><p><br></p><p>On the other hand, the red haired guy was totally hiding his true power. Even Leon and that Silver Haired maid were the same. And what was with the look the maid was throwing at her.</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t remember talking to her ever nor did she have any enemies among vampires. Then what’s up with that look?</p><p><br></p><p>It’s just that when Clayman entered, things changed.</p><p><br></p><p>The most surprising thing was that he hit her and she didn't even question it.</p><p><br></p><p>By now Rimuru was sure that he was somehow controlling Milim.</p><p><br></p><p>Raphael couldn't find anything wrong with her either.</p><p><br></p><p>While Clayman was babbling about whatever came to his mind, she heard something unexpected.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>The individual Salvatore is undergoing an evolution. Beings associated with him will be given the Blessing of the Voice of the World.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p>… what?</p><p><br></p><p>She felt her power rising and Skills being transformed as she sat stunned at the sudden turn of events.</p><p><br></p><p>'Veldora, do you know what's going on?' She asked in her head but there was no reply.</p><p><br></p><p>Now that she thought of it, Veldora had gone stiff as soon as the Maids of the Demon Lord opened the Gate to this place. He then made excuses to run away quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>Just what the hell happened in the fight to awaken Sal.</p><p><br></p><p>She used the soul link to ask Benimaru and got the information.</p><p><br></p><p>Chaos Dragon?</p><p><br></p><p>Undead.</p><p><br></p><p>Sal’s Awakening was completed and she finally paid attention to the meeting again.</p><p><br></p><p>“And this, this lowly slime caused a war, sacrificing countless souls to complete her own ambitions. She came in to get the souls killed by the Evil Dragon, Veldora, for her own. She is not even a Demon Lord, just a fake.”</p><p><br></p><p>By this point she was completely fed up with the crap he was uttering so she decided to intervene.</p><p><br></p><p>“Say, all of this is good and all but… I don’t see why what I do is any of your problem? Why the hell are you getting so pissed? Jealous?”</p><p><br></p><p>“How dare!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Shut up. I have already wasted a lot of my time on your dumb story. Tell me why have you called me here already?” She put her Demon Lord’s Haki behind her voice.</p><p><br></p><p>“You!”</p><p><br></p><p>“She is not wrong though Clayman. Why exactly have you called this meeting? As far as I remember there were no rules against what she has done.” The red haired guy, Guy Crimson, spoke up.</p><p><br></p><p>Others eyed him similarly</p><p><br></p><p>“O-of course. I am holding this meeting to ask for judgement against her for attacking and killing my subordinate, Pirone.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Who?” She asked, surprised. In this case, she really didn’t know.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do not pretend, worthless curr. I know it is you who has killed my subordinate who had gone to check the Jura Forest to investigate the disturbance.”</p><p><br></p><p>‘Do you know anything about this, Raphael-san?’</p><p><br></p><p>‘<em>Negative. It is advised to ask Salvatore as he too participated in the battle.</em>’</p><p><br></p><p>She did just that. ‘Sal, do you know of someone called Pirone?’</p><p><br></p><p>‘<em>Eh Pirone? Yes. I do. She was one of Clayman’s subordinates. I sensed her in Jura Forest and had Mjurran kill her off. Is he using that as an excuse?</em>’</p><p><br></p><p>‘Yes. He has been annoying since the meeting started. He even has Milim under some kind of mind control. I just want to punch his face so bad.’</p><p><br></p><p>‘<em>Okay listen to me. Bait him. Use my name. Tell everyone that it was Mjurran who was freed from Clayman’s control who did it. I will send you the proof of it. And then tell them Mjurran is currently under my service and I am looking to kill him and anyone related to him because of his attack. Tell him I just killed two clowns called Footman and Tear before the Walpurgis started. Trust me. If anything happens, summon me there. I have a lot to pay him back for.</em>’</p><p><br></p><p>‘Alright. But if all these Demon Lords try to come after me, I will haunt you after I die.’ She replied before addressing the crowd in front of everyone. “I didn’t kill Pirone. She was killed by a majin called Mjurran.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Liar. Mjurran is one of my subordinates who is dead.” He shouted back.</p><p><br></p><p>“A subordinate whom you had under control through a spell. Unfortunately for you, she met Salvatore and he freed her from the spell. Salvatore himself had a bone to pick with you because of your attack on him. Currently the two of them are hunting for all your subordinates.” She looked as his face changed expressions. “I think they went to finish off someone called Footman and Tear, clowns, and from the information we got, they were killed right before the Walpurgis Banquet started.’</p><p><br></p><p>“How dare he! I will kill him. I will rip apart his soul and tear it into pieces!”</p><p><br></p><p>Oh boy.</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t care what you want to do but first answer me, why have you called me here?”</p><p><br></p><p>“You,you are in cohort with that damned abomination!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Salvatore is my friend. A very close friend even. But he is responsible for his own actions. I am not his master. But even if it was so, I don’t see the need for the Walpurgis.” She faced the others. “I was not aware that the Walpurgis was for Demon Lords to clean up after each other’s messes. I was of the thinking that for Demon Lords, power mattered the most. So, why are we going through all this drama again? If he has a problem with me, we can fight it off. If he has a problem with Salvatore, I can call him and they can fight it off. The winner decides what is right. Instead, I am here, listening to his long rant on him being a racist dumbass. And if that was not enough, the idiot has been trying to control my mind all this time. It’s annoying.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Wha….” The idiot stumbled back at her last comment.</p><p><br></p><p>“The Walpurgis is not for us to clean up other Demon Lords’ mess. We indeed follow the way of the strong.” Guy stated. “And controlling the mind is indeed not allowed. This matter is between you two. Settle it between yourself.”</p><p><br></p><p>“B-but Guy….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you have a problem with what I say Clayman?” Guy smiled, causing the idiot to go stiff.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Very well. I will show this upstart, her place.\" He rose up from his seat as the one at the head, Guy, rearranged the whole space.</p><p><br></p><p>Surprisingly, Milim followed him.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Oi oi, why is Milim fighting for him? It's not fair, you know. It's two vs one. Not fair. Cheating. I say cheating.\" Ramiris protested.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Sit down. She can summon anyone for help.\" Guy said and she understood.</p><p><br></p><p>‘Veldora, need a hand here.’ She didn’t think she could take on Milim by herself.</p><p><br></p><p>‘*<em>Snore*</em> *<em>snore</em>*’</p><p><br></p><p>What came in was only the sound of clearly fake snores from the other end.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>‘Sal, I am summoning you now.’</p><p><br></p><p>‘<em>Alright.</em>’</p><p><br></p><p>‘Do it, Raphael-san.’</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Luminous Valentine -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>A summoning circle lit up in the middle of the halls and when the light dissipated, there stood a man with blonde hair and green eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Salvatore.</p><p><br></p><p>The man who taught Chronoa.</p><p><br></p><p>She tried to look through him but couldn’t see anything.</p><p><br></p><p>Even at her level, she couldn’t find a shred of energy from him.</p><p><br></p><p>But she knew that she would get an opportunity.</p><p><br></p><p>Whatever game Milim was playing will force him to reveal his power and she will get to see what’s so special about him for her to choose him.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Guy Crimson -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>How interesting.</p><p><br></p><p>The Walpurgis was turning out to be more interesting than anything in the last millena.</p><p><br></p><p>First was the slime, a slime who became a True Demon Lord and not just that but also gained an Ultimate Skill at that. A feat which even some of the older Demon Lords hadn’t been able to achieve.</p><p><br></p><p>This alone made things interesting.</p><p><br></p><p>Not to mention she carried the Blessing of Veldora which proved that she was actually on good terms with Veldora and the general story had a lot of faults.</p><p><br></p><p>It was when the guy appeared that he actually sat straighter in his seat.</p><p><br></p><p>A True Hero like Leon, and one with an Ultimate Skill at that.</p><p><br></p><p>The fact that he was a Dragonoid was also.</p><p><br></p><p>He could feel the shift in Velzard as soon as he appeared.</p><p><br>What he could have never expected was the feeling he was giving off.</p><p><br></p><p>That aura was slightly reminiscent of….<em>him</em>.</p><p><br></p><p>She must have sensed it too. It would be impossible for her of all people to not recognize this aura.</p><p><br></p><p>Ramiris might not recall due to not being fully back to her prime but Dino's reaction was telling.</p><p><br></p><p>The Sleeping Ruler was looking at the boy, wide awake, not even blinking an eye the entire time.</p><p><br></p><p>“Since everyone is here, let’s get this over with.” He clapped his hands and shifted the space to create an area for them to fight. A barrier was erected around it.</p><p><br></p><p>Clayman used a fox Majin and a puppet while the Slime was followed by her wolf and Oni subordinate.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy however stepped forward first and spoke calmly as his magicules started seeping out.</p><p><br></p><p>“Clayman… I am going to kill you today. Destroy you, astral body and all. There is no doubt of this fact.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Guy found himself smirking at the boy’s arrogance.</p><p><br></p><p>“But I will give you a chance first. Answer one question of mine and I will spare the life of that elf Kagali. Deny and I will go there and I promise you that I will make her death extremely painful.”</p><p><br></p><p>Clayman snarled like an animal at this and attacked him with his marionette strings but they were just blown away by the ever increasing power the boy was giving off.</p><p><br></p><p>“This will be the one and only chance for you, Clayman. Answer me.” His tone was still even but his rage could be felt in his aura as it threatened to destroy the place.</p><p><br></p><p>It was well above an Awakened Demon Lord. Actually in terms of base power it was even reaching the levels compared to Milim herself. Not quite there yet but approaching.</p><p><br></p><p>“Milim, you idiotic wretch, attack him. Kill him. Tear him to pieces.”</p><p><br></p><p>Milim kept with her act and raced forward towards him but the boy did something which made Velzard grip his shoulder while he found his mouth open in surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>He raised a hand and Milim was trapped in a barrier. One extremely familiar barrier. Milim bashed on the barrier but Guy knew that she would have to seriously attack to get past that one.</p><p><br></p><p>“But that’s…” Ramiris exclaimed.</p><p><br></p><p>Uriel, Lord of Vows. The skill <em>he</em> carried….</p><p><br></p><p>“Tell me Clayman… did<em> you order the release of the Chaos Dragon</em>?”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Chaos Dragon?</p><p><br></p><p>The banging on the barrier stopped as Milim turned her head towards the deathman.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Velzard, strengthen the barrier.\" He did the same, just in time for half the barrier to be covered by a white light.</p><p><br></p><p>When the light dispersed, Milim was sitting over Clayman's body, punching whatever remained of it.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Guy, remove the barrier.\" Ramiris asked as she was already ready to go inside.</p><p><br></p><p>\"The fight hasn't finished yet.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"What the hell do you mean 'fight isn't finished'? Clayman's dead.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Milim isn't defeated or given up yet.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Wha…\"</p><p><br></p><p><strong>– Salvatore –</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She really flipped out at the name of Chaos Dragon.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Sal, this…\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Make a barrier and protect Shion and others. She just wants to vent. I will take care of this.\"</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded, still a bit confused.</p><p><br></p><p>I put up another barrier using Uriel just in case.</p><p><br></p><p>With all this done, I walked up to her. \"Milim.\"</p><p><br></p><p>She didn't reply and kept on hitting.</p><p><br></p><p>I put a hand on her shoulder but she backhanded me and I was thrown a few steps back.</p><p><br></p><p>It didn't look like she'd be stopping anytime soon because Clayman was merely a pulp by now.</p><p><br></p><p>So I did the only thing which came to my mind.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Black Blaze Flare.\" I targeted the corpse of Clayman and burned it.</p><p><br></p><p>And boy did that get her attention towards me.</p><p><br></p><p>She jumped, trying to punch me. I dodged, using Uriel to bind her once moreover but she just blasted through it.</p><p><br></p><p>I know she wasn't trying to kill me. It was more like she was letting out her anger.</p><p><br></p><p>Her form had changed into her Battle Mode so I did the same and defended against her attacks. Her blows were getting stronger due to Sataneel's effect being used.</p><p><br></p><p>The clashes between us became intense.</p><p><br></p><p>I could feel the strength that I possessed now. If I were to face Chaos Dragon now, I could easily subdue it with raw power alone. Milim's attacks were only making scratches at best.</p><p><br></p><p>After what seemed like a few hours, she calmed down and sat on the ground and I sat in front of her.</p><p><br></p><p>I brought out the core of the Chaos Dragon and put it down in front of her. \"I made sure to not harm it and have even purified the core. Maybe in a few months you will have your friend back.\" I patted her head lightly.</p><p><br></p><p>Light returned to her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>She took Chaos Dragon’s core and hugged it close to her chest and then faced me. “Do you know others who are with Clayman?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"A few yes. The clowns that Rimuru said I killed are actually alive. We were just baiting him. Even the elf, now I know that they were truly working together. In fact many people here would know the elf. She's Curse Lord Kazeram. It’s a very long story.\" With Raphael or rather Solomon in my head, my memories regarding the world were much more complete.</p><p><br></p><p>There were obviously many differences like in the webnovel version, light novel version and any other versions. Not to mention the world itself was too big for everything to have been included in mere twenty or twenty five books. Still, It gave me a very good idea about how things were. I still verified things though.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tell me everything after this.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, I want to know about it too.” Rimuru came up from behind me and said, I nodded at her too.</p><p><br></p><p>The barrier around us fell and sounds of claps sounded in the room.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Luminous Valentine -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She was clenching her hands after seeing the fight.</p><p><br></p><p>He was matching Milim Nava, although she was not serious, neither was he. But just from the amount of power they were throwing around, she could tell that he was even stronger than than. Far stronger.</p><p><br></p><p>A voice sounded as Guy got up from his seat and walked up to the centre of the room. “What an interesting show. I believe this matter is settled. Let's get on with the Walpurgis.”</p><p><br></p><p>The rest of the meeting was about Clayman's treachery. Frey and Milim provided the evidence. That man provided the rest. Not like anyone cared.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone already knew that Milim was playing her games and that Clayman was doing some shady things.</p><p><br></p><p>Then came the matter of the new Demon Lord. That slime was accepted as a Demon Lord quite easily. Not a surprise as she was a True Demon Lord. Much better compared to the likes of Frey and Carrion. The latter two quitting was a surprise though.</p><p><br></p><p>Understandable but surprising.</p><p><br></p><p>\"We are still short of two Demon Lords to be called the Ten Great Demon Lords. Salvatore, that's your name, right? Why don't you join us here?\" Guy offered.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I… thank you for the offer but I had promised Milim to be her rival when she had saved my life. I think being a Hero works well with that goal.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Eh… shame. You would have made a good Demon Lord. Then what about the one hiding inside you?\"</p><p><br></p><p>… what?</p><p><br></p><p>The man looked a bit serious but then his look changed to that of surprise. He raised a hand and magicules gathered, creating a body near him.</p><p><br></p><p>It transformed, taking the shape of a woman with blonde hair and slightly tanned skin. A dragon?</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>She realised with stunned disbelief. It was a True Dragon.</p><p><br></p><p>The only True Dragons known to the world were the Star Dragon King Veldanava, White Ice Dragon and the partner of Guy Crimson, Velzard, Scorch Dragon and the guardian of the Eastern Empire, Velgrynd and that abominable lizard but this… this was not one she knew.</p><p><br></p><p>Although, looking at the face of Velzard, it didn't seem like even she knew of her. Actually, the man himself looked surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Would you introduce yourself?\" Guy asked.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I am the partner of Salvatore. My name is… Vritra, the Draught Dragon.\"</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>\"Are you serious?\" Dino whispered.</p><p><br></p><p>\"She does feel like a True Dragon.\" Dagruel commented.</p><p><br></p><p>Ramiris flew all over her and verified it too.</p><p><br></p><p>\"How were you even born? True Dragon's are generally born in the world.\" Ramiris questioned. \"Why are you in Sal's soul?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I have always been with him. Since he was born. I was merely a fragment of myself with barely any consciousness. As he evolved, I gained consciousness. In a way I am myself but I am also a part of him.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you have any memories of your own, of this world?” Velzard asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Memories? A few. Almost like a story. Memories from my partner’s previous lives. Stories of the past and stories of the future, of how this world was born and what happened after. Some memories are here while most are lost or hazy.” She spoke as she eyed everyone one by one, her eyes stopping at some people for a while.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is it that you want to do now?” Velzard questioned.</p><p><br></p><p>“Me? I will obviously stay with my partner. I enjoy watching him overcoming all the odds in his path. Time and time again, he fights against odds which would have crushed normal people and rises up stronger than before. It’s truly the best fun to watch.”</p><p><br></p><p>Wasn’t this what Hinata called a stalker?</p><p><br></p><p>“Then do as you wish. As a True Dragon, you are now the youngest amongst us. Just take care to not go on a destructive rampage or I will have to step in.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Kihihihi I am the partner of a Hero. Wouldn’t it shame him if I were to rampage around without any provocation? I will keep your words in mind, Sister.”</p><p><br></p><p>By this point she was already done with what she had come to do here so she went to him to say her piece.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Salvatore -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>My head was still trying to comprehend what was happening right now.</p><p><br></p><p>The dragon inside my Sacred Gear had awakened.</p><p><br></p><p>It had become a True Dragon out of nowhere. Like what the fuck dude?</p><p><br></p><p>And she was now looking like a fate grand order version of Vritra which was giving me very complicated feelings.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Rimuru had been throwing me weird looks.</p><p><br></p><p>Her only words when the thing about memories had come out were….explain.</p><p><br></p><p>I just asked Solomon to give her all the memories I had of this world and let her figure out for herself.</p><p><br></p><p>‘<em>Sal.</em>’</p><p><br></p><p>‘Yes.’</p><p><br></p><p>‘<em>I can understand your point of view too. Telling someone you just met that you know them from an anime is beyond weird and most people would call you crazy because of it but from the next time, do talk to me about this.</em>’</p><p><br></p><p>‘I was going to broach the subject later because you had just been through a lot. I didn’t want to throw you into an existential crisis. Not to mention I didn’t remember everything either.’</p><p><br></p><p>‘<em>Do you see me throwing punches at you?</em>’</p><p><br></p><p>‘....what?’</p><p><br></p><p>‘<em>Do you see me trying to beat you into the ground right now?</em>’</p><p><br></p><p>‘....no.’</p><p><br></p><p>‘<em>It means I understand your thoughts. It’s just that, don’t do it next time.</em>’</p><p><br></p><p>‘Okay.’</p><p><br></p><p>‘<em>Despite the little time we have spent together, I see you as someone close. I don’t like it when you hide such important things from me. I understand it but I don’t like it.</em>’</p><p><br></p><p>‘I see.’</p><p><br></p><p>While Vritra was throwing bombs on them, I was too busy with Rimuru to listen or even care about what she was saying. Today was extremely exhausting, mentally speaking. I needed some rest.</p><p><br></p><p>My attention was only broken when a silver haired woman came and stood in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. How may I help you?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will not lose. I will take her from you and make her mine.”</p><p><br></p><p>….say what?</p><p><br></p><p>And then I recalled she was talking about Chloe or rather Chronoa.</p><p><br></p><p>“Say miss, haven’t you heard of the saying?”</p><p><br></p><p>“What saying?”</p><p><br></p><p>“NTR is a trash fetish.”</p><p><br></p><p>Her brows scrunched with Vritra and Rimuru cackled a little.</p><p><br></p><p>“What do you mean?” She questioned, glaring at the two girls.</p><p><br></p><p>“I mean, whatever she chooses, I will support her. There is nothing to take to begin with. I do not own her. She is my dear student. I just want her to be happy. Just don’t force her or I will be your enemy.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmph, who’s afraid to be your enemy?” She snorted.</p><p><br></p><p>‘Kihihihi such a brave little girl.” Vritra teased and I had the urge to facepalm as Luminous’ Demon Lord’s Haki flared as she looked at the Dragon enraged.</p><p><br></p><p>“My my, so easy to get angry. But don’t be so. I think you are quite interesting. A bit stubborn but I like that within people. Trying to resist obstacles and then overcoming them. A beautiful thing, isn’t it? But just some advice for the future.” She snapped her finger and I felt Negation Zone as Luminous’ Demon Lord’s Haki dissipated. “I don’t like people threatening me.”</p><p><br></p><p>This chick’s crazy.</p><p><br></p><p>I decided to intervene before things got any messier. “Okay, break it up you two.” I turned to Luminous. “I think you should go back soon. This Walpurgis was organised to send you out of the castle so that they could try a hand at getting her. Don’t underestimate them. They are quite resourceful. For example the one who had been posing as you will be destroyed within moments if they were to fight seriously. Only Hinata and you yourself can fight.”</p><p><br></p><p>She paused when she heard what I said, after which she just turned and sent her subordinate who had been posing as the Demon Lord back with some orders.</p><p><br></p><p>I did get a small thanks from her as a thought transmission.</p><p><br></p><p>‘<em>She’s such a tsundere.</em>’ Vritra’s voice sounded in my ears.</p><p><br></p><p>‘Stop provoking her. We might need their help.’</p><p><br></p><p>‘<em>Eh? I was being serious, you know. I am really interested in her.</em>’ She whined.</p><p><br></p><p>‘<em>Well….she’s not half bad.</em>’ Rimuru joined in.</p><p><br></p><p>Et tu Rimuru.</p><p><br></p><p>The rest of the Walpurgis was basically Guy asking for the name of the Council and Rimuru blatantly copying the names from the memories I had given her.</p><p><br></p><p>At the end of the day, we returned back to the Tempest.</p><p><br></p><p>Milim had to return back to take care of the damages in her kingdom first.</p><p><br></p><p>Despite her frivolous attitude, she was a good ruler when it came to protecting her citizens. She did say that she will return and then we will go out for a hunt.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru wanted to do the same.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sal.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“With these memories, we are going to meta the shit out of this world.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure.” I suddenly felt bad for the supposed villains of this world.</p><p><br></p><p>Just for a little bit.</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/Y73QfHMPKh\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/Y73QfHMPKh</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><strong>We finally have a chapter of ‘To be a Hero.’</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>As you all can see, canon was thrown out of the window in the chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Poor Yuuki is already dead.

That much is without a doubt. But the difference between an Enlightened and a Saint is too much. Not to mention I was some kind of weird Hybrid Saint or whatnot with several Ultimate Skills. Even the advantage she had of the Hero’s Egg over the other Enlightened was not applicable against someone like me.</p><p><br></p><p>No matter how many Skills she used or strength she used it was all useless against Uriel’s Magic Negation and Barriers. The forest around us was being torn down while the ground under our feet was being scorched by the sheer power of the attack but….her sword didn’t move.</p><p><br></p><p>Not.a.single.fucking.inch.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally deciding to end all this, I used Shadow Prison on her, pulling her into a Shadow Realm till only her neck and above is visible. All the while my Leviathan was sucking out her magicules, rendering her powerless.</p><p><br></p><p>I let her struggle and try everything she wanted to and when she was done, I sat down in front of her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you ready to talk now?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at me with gritted teeth but didn’t say anything.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t look at me like that. Shizu-sensei talked about your personality and this was the best way I could think of to make you understand. I am not your enemy. An enemy would have cut your head off the first chance they got.”</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t say anything.</p><p><br></p><p>“How did you get the information about Rimuru?” I asked the question which had been in my mind for a while. I did know of this world but there were several versions. The Webnovel one, the Light Novel one and the Anime one. I only knew bits and pieces of those. Not to mention, this could be an entirely different universe with the differences I had already encountered. Gathering information is the way to go.</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t answer.</p><p><br></p><p>Stubborn girl.</p><p><br></p><p>“Very well. I have all the time in the world. I will just sleep here till you are ready to answer. Although I can’t say the same about your subordinates who were maintaining the barrier. They must be getting anxious and scared, trapped in a world of darkness.” I smiled lightly.</p><p><br></p><p>It did the trick.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why? Why are you doing it for that… that monster?”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s quite racist of you, ya know. Rimuru is not bad. She… helped my students. Not to mention Sensei”</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t know anything about monsters. You haven’t seen the damage and chaos they cause. You have seen nothing of this world.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ah this….</p><p><br></p><p>“Well I have been an adventurer for the last two years but here’s a secret. Before those two years, I was a slave.”</p><p><br></p><p>Her eyes widened. “I was summoned at the age of 14, dragged away from my world, away from my only family, a ten year old brother of mine all alone… by humans. There I was tortured, mentally and physically, made to kill till I got numb and finally broke through by sheer luck. It was there I met Sensei and she took me in and I made it to where I am today. So you see Hinata-chan, can I call you Hinata-chan? Okay, I will call you Hinata-chan.” I didn’t give her any chance to retort. “I don’t just know about monsters, I also know more about the humans of this world than you. Unlike you who was lucky enough to encounter Sensei when she walked into this world, I have seen the worst and the best of this world, between monsters and humans. And to be honest, there’s not much difference between them.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Not everyone is like them.” She shouted back.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then how can you say the same about monsters? As I said, you are awfully racist, Hina-chan? Oh. I like this name better. Cool. I will call you Hina-chan then.”</p><p><br></p><p>She gritted her teeth.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see you are not convinced. Then let me ask you something. How did you get that Hero’s Egg of yours? Whose blessing did you take for it?”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at me without a word but I saw her gaze flicker.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. You <em>do</em> know. You took the blessing of <em>Demon Lord</em> Ramiris. And yet, I don’t see you bitching about it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s not the same. Ramiris didn’t become a Demon Lord of her own choice.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And neither was Rimuru born as a monster of her own choice.” I countered shutting her up instantly. “But that wasn’t exactly the issue here, was it? The issue was the Monster Nation Tempest. What do you even know about the nation?”</p><p><br></p><p>She kept quiet so I continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“Rimuru has banned attacks on humans ever since the nation was formed because she was a former human herself. She even ordered her people to assist adventurers who are in trouble in the Jura Forest. The only danger the Monster Nation is….is to the profits of the surrounding nations who charge money for traders to pass through them. Rimuru opened a road through the Jura Forest and has assured safety to traders that use the route. This cut into the prices of things and so the Falmuth Nation organised this attack. I am pretty sure if you go back and check, you will find several thick donations to your church to assist in this attack. With things like these, can you really say who is the real monster here?”</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t say anything, remaining quiet at my words.</p><p><br></p><p>“You can take your people and leave. As for the Falmuth army… they won’t be returning anywhere.” I had sensed Rimuru’s aura going haywire a few minutes ago.</p><p><br></p><p>Seems like the birth of the Demon Lord is near.</p><p><br></p><p>She seemed to react to this and raised her head. “You are going to kill them?” She asked me shocked.</p><p><br></p><p>I shook my head. “While I would love to do it, them being the people who summoned and enslaved me…” Her eyes widened. “The people and the army itself were not at fault. I have no enmity with them. The top brass of the nation however… that’s a different game. As for the army… they did attack and kill the peaceful residents of a nation and pushed an innocent girl towards accepting her monster side. Whatever they get, will be completely deserving of their actions.”</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly, I sensed someone behind me dashing towards me with a black sword raised above her head. She had long open black hair and black eyes and looked Japanese by her features. The sword also contained energy and my Milim’s eye told me that it contained a spirit of some kind. A High Ranking one at that.</p><p><br></p><p>“No Stop, Ena.” I saw Hinata shout at the girl but she had already jumped, so I did the only thing that came to my mind.</p><p><br></p><p>I slapped her aside and put her in the same situation as Hinata.</p><p><br></p><p>She was strong. An Enlightened at such a young age was quite an achievement.</p><p><br></p><p>But she was far from Hinata’s level.</p><p><br></p><p>“One of your people? I didn’t sense her nearby when I came. Doesn’t matter. What’s your decision, Hina-chan?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I… I’ll leave.” She let out a sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>“Cool. Oh, by the way, be careful of Yuuki. That guy… he’s dangerous.” I said as I let her out.</p><p><br></p><p>“He is one of Shizu-san’s students.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And also the guy who convinced you that you were a burden on her, wasn’t he?”</p><p><br></p><p>Her eyes widened.</p><p><br></p><p>“Trust me. I know what I am saying. Whether you believe me or not is up to you. But I will tell you something.” I faced her, remembering the reason she left Shizu-sensei to go out on her own. “I too have a Skill which can copy other Skills. I got it on the day I met Sensei and accidentally used it on her. She was not angry. Instead, she was relieved that she could pass on her skills to someone and that her student will be safer. Our Sensei was never the kind of person to hold something like that against you. In fact, she would have encouraged you to copy all her Skills instead just so you could be safer. Don’t let your silly thoughts disturb your sleep. Goodbye. If you want to find me later on, you can come to Tempest. Even if I am not there, they will know where I am. Don’t go to Yuuki or ask him about me.”</p><p><br></p><p>I left the girl to her thoughts as I turned and picked up my sword which was still pierced into the ground. The Ena girl came between me and Hinata, her sword raised to defend.</p><p><br></p><p>I let out a chuckle.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is your name?” I asked. I didn’t know someone like her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Seishuuin Ena.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha cool name. I think I remember someone with that name.” Wasn’t there a character in the LN Campione with the same name? “She was a priestess of Susanoo and his adopted granddaughter of sorts.”</p><p><br></p><p>The girl got an odd look on her face. “You know Gramps?”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Say what?</p><p><br></p><p>“Excuse me?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Gramps. You know my Gramps? Susanoo.” She asked again.</p><p><br></p><p>This is not real, right? She has to be joking now.</p><p><br></p><p>Another Otaku?</p><p><br></p><p>But then again, I was supposedly in the Boob Anime so why the fuck not.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, I decided to check to make sure.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are Ena… like in the one from the Four Clans of the History Compilation Committee. Do you know someone called Kusanagi Godou, Mariya Yuri? I don’t remember the other names. Also, Susanoo was in the Underworld in your world?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, I am. Kusanagi who? Do you know Yuri?” She asked, curious this time.</p><p><br></p><p>Milim’s Ears detected no lies.</p><p><br></p><p>Oh fuck.</p><p><br></p><p>“So that sword… it’s the Kusanagi Sword?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umu.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And you were summoned to this world?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No… I just wandered around. A Stray Otherworlder. Do you know Yuri? Are you from my world?” She asked me quite hopefully.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh… I am not from your world. It’s… hard to explain and currently I don’t have much time to explain things so you will have to wait. Find me in a week or so and I will tell you whatever I know.” I promised the girl.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked like she wanted to ask a few more things but Hinata held her back and I sensed Jibril flying above us in the sky.</p><p><br></p><p>“Master… Tempest… the city was attacked. We are supporting them but many people are dead.” She relayed through her thought transmission.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked back at Hinata. “I need to go.” And gave another look at Ena as I rushed towards the city.</p><p><br></p><p>Before leaving I passed on a piece of paper to Hinata giving her some information.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Shanks -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He raced towards the Tempest Nation under the orders of his master, his companions behind him.</p><p><br></p><p>The place had been attacked from what Jibril had told them. There were orcs outside the village.</p><p><br></p><p>Dammit. Orcs again.</p><p><br></p><p>“You damn swines. You took our village and now you come to attack even this place.” Shuten behind him snarled and he could agree with his sentiments too.</p><p><br></p><p>He brought out his sword and dashed towards them only to clash with someone.</p><p><br></p><p>White hair, horn on his head. His eyes widened as he recognised the one blocking him. “You are…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Old man!”</p><p><br></p><p>The other two behind him also realised this and stopped. “Old man, you are alive! We thought that all of you were… the village was destroyed completely… but why then… the orcs.” He glared at the orc who bowed his head as if ashamed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Calm down, kid. The orcs are not the enemies.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Shanks. I… got named, Old man. I am called Shanks. These two are called Shuten and Ibaraki. Our master told us to assist the Tempest Nation because the ruler was good friends with his teacher.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Shanks then. I was named by Rimuru-sama as Hakuryu.” He let out a sigh. “It’s better if you come in. Many things happened. The orcs were also victims of the schemes of a high level Majin. Come with me. I will explain everything.”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded but followed behind the old man. Meanwhile, Shuten and Ibaraki asked something. “Who else was able to escape, Old Man?” He too looked at the old man for an answer but he just kept walking forward. A pit formed in his stomach as he realised something.</p><p><br></p><p>Soon enough, he found that his suspicions were correct.</p><p><br></p><p>There, between the crowd of goblins, lay a body. “It’s…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Shion. Rimuru-sama named her Shion…”</p><p><br></p><p>He fell to his knees. “I failed. Once more. I failed to save another one of my family… I…”</p><p><br></p><p>Some others seemed to have realised his presence as they turned towards him. He recognised them with a glance. “The Young Lord, Princess, and two other members…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Brother, you are alive. We…” The Young Lord tried to say something but stopped. He understood too.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next hour, they explained the situation to him.</p><p><br></p><p>His magicules flared.</p><p><br></p><p>“Those bastards. They deserve to die. All of them deserve to die.”</p><p><br></p><p>Shuten and Ibaraki snarled behind him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Be quiet. Let Master come. He will decide what we should do next.” He looked at the Young Lord, now called Benimaru and explained. “Our Master is a student of Rimuru-sama’s friend, Shizue Izawa. He freed the monsters of Jura Forest who were captured by Slavers. When he heard of the attack, he asked us to come ahead and assist Tempest… but we were late. I failed everyone. My clan, my master… Everyone.”</p><p><br></p><p>As he was drowning in his regret, he heard some commotion in the distance.</p><p><br></p><p>Looking back, he saw his Master coming towards them. Some goblins and orcs had gathered to try to stop him so he turned towards his clansmen.</p><p><br></p><p>“Old Man, Young Lord… he is my Master.”</p><p><br></p><p>They walked towards them to clear the matter but someone was already ahead of them.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Salvatore -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Just walking in with a sword and armour was probably not a good idea.</p><p><br></p><p>This place was attacked by humans a while ago and I for all matters and purposes looked and even felt like a human unless I let out my Draconic Aura.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the Goblins and Orcs surrounding me wondering how to diffuse the situation peacefully maybe.</p><p><br></p><p>My thoughts were halted when I heard a familiar voice. “Brother. Is that you Salvatore?” I looked towards the side to see Kaijin and his brothers walk towards me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Kaijin. What are you doing here?” I asked. They explained and I found out that some things hadn’t changed </p><p><br></p><p>I learned what happened since I left Dwargon. </p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully with Kaijin vouching for me followed by Shanks and the Oni, I was allowed inside.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru was still sitting there, listlessly in front of the bodies of her subordinates.</p><p><br></p><p>As luck would have it, the elf girl came to Rimuru’s side just in time and was telling her the story about the Dragon Princess and the resurrection of the Dragon.</p><p><br></p><p>“The barrier is holding the souls of the deceased.” The girl said and I chose this moment to join the conversation.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will keep the barrier intact.” In fact, Astarte could recreate their bodies as well and resurrect everyone but the amount of calculations and knowledge needed for those would be insane and Making Rimuru a Demon Lord would be much easier in comparison.</p><p><br></p><p>They turned towards me, realising I was there. She thought of something and the look on her face changed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Salvatore.” The look in her eye was that of guilt and despair mixed with a slight hope.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will keep the barrier active. None of the souls will be dispersed.” To show them what I meant, I called out Uriel in my head and made a barrier around the original holy barrier.</p><p><br></p><p>Uriel’s barriers were strong enough to take on attacks from Demon Lords. Keeping something like magicules inside will not be a problem.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru looked dazed for a second before nodding. “Thank you. Your barrier will work.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ah. Maybe she was told by Great Sage.</p><p><br></p><p>“If you want to fight against Falmuth, I can assist. Those people had summoned me away from my world and kept me under an enslavement spell for two years. I need to settle some scores too. You can keep the souls though.”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at me with a complicated gaze. “You are not repulsed by my thoughts of killing them and becoming a Demon Lord?”</p><p><br></p><p>… yes. She was until recently a normal human from a peaceful world. </p><p><br></p><p>The same as me when I was summoned to this world.</p><p><br></p><p>And while my innocence was slowly crushed by the people of this world, hers was smashed into fucking smithereens by a fucking sledgehammer.</p><p><br></p><p>I can guess her thoughts so I gave her a sympathetic smile. “I have done plenty of things myself which I am not proud of and while I was under the control of someone’s magic back then, it still doesn’t change the fact that I did those things. I can understand your thoughts but you must also understand. This is war. They were the ones who attacked your people. The people you vowed to protect. You are not wrong in having such thoughts.” I assured her and saw that some light in her eyes returned.</p><p><br></p><p>Events happened very quickly after that. The people of Tempest wanted blood and this time their leader agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>I too decided to pay a visit to those bastards of Falmuth and give them a suitable payback for their hospitality. Razen, Folgen and that bastard King… as for the summoned otherworlders… if they face me, I will just tie them up and throw them to the monsters of Tempest.</p><p><br><br></p><p></p><p></p><p><br><br></p><p>While Rimuru and the rest went to different places to break the crystals used for maintaining the barrier, I searched for the strongest Magical aura from the opponent’s side.</p><p><br></p><p>It was not hard to find the right one.</p><p><br></p><p>Razen. The Majin who guarded the Falmuth Nation for several generations.</p><p><br></p><p>I saw that he was watching over Shogo and the others so I didn’t interfere directly and only sent my own subordinates to lend a helping hand.</p><p><br></p><p>The Oni under me were more than happy to oblige. Even Jibril and Olga were wrecking havoc among the enemies.</p><p><br></p><p>Dark Elves were originally elves who were corrupted by the Chaos Dragon’s magicules and became Dark Elves.</p><p><br></p><p>This gave them Demonoid-like characteristics, which include the ability to be named.</p><p><br></p><p>While normal Elves can get the Blessing of the Spirits, Dark Elves use the Demon Lord Route.</p><p><br></p><p>Olga was quite adept in Shadow Magic and necromancy just like the one she was named after.</p><p><br></p><p>While Jibril was actually descended from Angels so she was quite adept at Light Magic.</p><p><br></p><p>And right now they were showcasing these powers to the best of their abilities</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Olga -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She hid in the shadows as she observed the human camp in front of her.</p><p><br></p><p>War.</p><p><br></p><p>It had been so long since she had participated in one.</p><p><br></p><p>And to be honest, she didn’t think she would be able to participate in another one. Not after failing miserably in the last one.</p><p><br></p><p>The one where she lost everything. Her friends, her comrades, her brother Sarion and even her heritage as an Elf to become… this… all against the Chaos Dragon.</p><p><br></p><p>The shame of the incident prevented her from going back to her people.</p><p><br></p><p>She had given up on living but killing herself was an act of cowardice which she would not accept. Thus, when she was attacked by the slave traders, she had just given up… or else how could those weaklings ever hope to rival the former general of the Elves and the sister of the Elven Hero Sarion, so easily?</p><p><br></p><p>She might have lost her heritage but she did retain the values of her people. To repay one’s debt.</p><p><br></p><p>Since Salvatore saved her life, she will dedicate it to him to repay the Master.</p><p><br></p><p>Sara Grimwald might have died but in her place, Olga Discordia can live.</p><p><br></p><p>She was broken from her thoughts by the thought transmissions sent by Jibril.</p><p><br></p><p>The time to attack had come.</p><p><br></p><p>She watched from the sky as blades of wind ran down on the camp of the humans and took this time to attack. Shadows bent to her will and pierced the enemies from below as she cast her next spell. The dead were raised to do her bidding.</p><p><br></p><p>The ones who had been their comrades a moment ago, now turned on them, becoming deadly foes.</p><p><br></p><p>In a matter of minutes, the entire force was taken care of and she led the undead towards the next attack target.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Mjurran -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She was hiding under the illusions to complete her part of the mission.</p><p><br></p><p>The task that was given to her was simple.</p><p><br></p><p>Take out one of the Five Fingers of Clayman, Pirone. She was the one responsible for the information gathering and scouting for Clayman’s forces and wasn’t exactly proficient in fighting.</p><p><br></p><p>As she had thought, she detected the presence of the said finger through her magic and got to work. She was given a name which increased her power by a lot.</p><p><br></p><p>She used her magic and guided the unaware monster into the trap. The unsuspecting Pirone didn’t know anything till the last moment where her life was taken away.</p><p><br></p><p>With her task completed, she left towards the other position.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Salvatore -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Hot damn.</p><p><br></p><p>Shanks needs to chill out a bit.</p><p><br></p><p>Unlike Benimaru who was still extremely calm… not, rather more appropriate to say, he was controlling his rage much better, Shanks was like a fucking berserker.</p><p><br></p><p>At this rate, it would have been better to name him Kaido rather than Shanks.</p><p><br></p><p>I will need to ask someone to teach him better.</p><p><br></p><p>On the other hand, Olga… that girl had experience. The ease with which the undead army was controlled showed that she was both good at magic and commanding people. It was something which generally comes with experience.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t even know anything about my subordinates’ past.</p><p><br></p><p>I guess I will have to talk to everyone after this war.</p><p><br></p><p>Jibril on the other hand, well she was… crazy.</p><p><br></p><p>That girl was throwing around Aoe spells as if they were candies just because she could. That said, she was good at taking orders and from what I have seen, extremely talented.</p><p><br></p><p>If she were taught well, she would reach the level of Shanks or even Irisviel.</p><p><br></p><p>My thoughts were distracted by the arrival of Razen who directly shot a Nuclear Magic towards Geld who was dragged back in time by Hakuryu.</p><p><br></p><p>He used this opportunity to teleport away from the place and I decided to step in.</p><p><br></p><p>“Salvatore-sama. This… I apologise for letting them get away.” Geld bowed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t mind. Razen is the strongest person from their side. It would have been odd if he was defeated so easily. I will take care of this.”</p><p><br></p><p>I teleported to where they had run off.</p><p><br></p><p>What greeted us was an attack, another Nuclear Cannon directly towards us.</p><p><br></p><p>“Stay.” I commanded as the spell crashed into me, dissipating as if it didn’t exist.</p><p><br></p><p>Uriel was such a cheat.</p><p><br></p><p>Even something like nuclear decay right at my face couldn’t do anything to me.</p><p><br></p><p>When the blast cleared, the other side saw me.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are… Salvatore. You’re alive.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hello Mr. Razen. I would say nice to meet you but that would be lying. But let’s not waste our time with such talks shall we. I believe we are already past that point by now.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Bastard. Do you think you are a hotshot after mixing with those monsters? Fucking traitor.” Shogo walked towards me, shouting but was thrown back by my Dragon’s Haki.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Razen and Folgen slid back a distance before holding himself.</p><p><br></p><p>I snapped a finger and he was drowned in the Shadow Prison and looked back at Razen. “Now that the nuisance is taken care of, shall we?”</p><p><br></p><p>“How did you survive?” He asked, taking a position. I sensed four spells all around me while he was trying to attract my attention and didn’t even bother to dodge.</p><p><br></p><p>I had already set up a barrier around the area to prevent teleportation.</p><p><br></p><p>“It doesn’t matter how I survived. What matters is that you won’t.” I drew my sword but Folgen had already attacked. It was slow. Even slower than Hinata’s attack.</p><p><br></p><p>But this time, I didn’t need to hold back to avoid hurting the attacker.</p><p><br></p><p>I used Shadow Prison and he got stuck in his place for just a moment as his limbs flew into the sky.</p><p><br></p><p>Razen was taken aback but I didn’t give him any chance to speak trash. He got the same treatment as he was dragged into the Shadow Prison quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure you don’t want to do anything to them?” Olga appeared behind me from the shadows.</p><p><br></p><p>I told them the basic story of my life since I was summoned to this world and she knew my enmity with the Falmuth Nation.</p><p><br></p><p>“I… don’t know what to do with them. I want to just kill them off but that would be letting them off too easy and I was never the type to use torture. I can’t think of anything to do to them.” I turned towards her and smiled lightly at her. “If you want, I can hand them to you if you want to try a hand.”</p><p><br></p><p>I might be dumb but I really didn’t know what to do with them. After taking so many lives, I was fine with killing someone or at least I knew how to deal with it but I just didn’t like the thought of torturing people. Maybe Shizue helped me more than I can think of. It’s just another thing I am thankful to her about.</p><p><br></p><p>“I think it’s quite noble of you. To not fall to their level. The difference between a person and a beast is that we can control our emotions. Just in this regard, you are far better than these people.”</p><p><br></p><p>“… thank you, Olga.”</p><p><br></p><p>Man… I should have given her a better name.</p><p><br></p><p>Now I feel bad for a completely different reason.</p><p><br></p><p>Shaking my head, I went out of the area just in time before Rimuru casted an Anti-Magic Area over the camp.</p><p><br></p><p>While she was taking care of the main camp, I went out to clear out any remnants.</p><p><br><br></p><p></p><p></p><p><br><br></p><p>I returned back to the Tempest Nation, only this time the scene was completely different.</p><p><br></p><p>Almost everyone of Rimuru’s subordinates were on the ground, unconscious while Rimuru herself was wearing a white cloth like the ancient Greek people.</p><p><br></p><p>Shanks and the Oni were protecting the others.</p><p><br></p><p>I walked forward only to be stopped by a guy… demon, red eyes, black suit, another of Irisviel’s kind maybe.</p><p><br></p><p>“Can I ask you to step back, please? My Master has tasked me with protecting her till she awakens.”</p><p><br></p><p>His tone was polite but the threat in the tone was clear although there was something else in his tone which I didn’t recognise.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t take offence to this because honestly… The guy was only doing his job.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did she summon you for this?” I asked and he nodded. “Alright.” I brought out the three unconscious prisoners from the Shadow Prison and threw them in one corner. “These were the strongest force in the Falmuth Kingdom. I thought she would like to take care of them personally.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.” He bowed.</p><p><br></p><p>I stepped back and watched as the harvest festival was completed and the Ritual was carried out.</p><p><br></p><p>Raphael used Beelzebub to suck in all the magicules in the barrier and used the energy. The issue of lacking energy came and the Demon offered his subordinates but I stopped him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Use these. I collected the souls of the ones my subordinates had killed. You can use them to substitute. I don’t think Rimuru is going to like seeing any more of her followers dying today… no matter for what reason.”</p><p><br></p><p>The Demon thought for a moment and nodded and Raphael agreed to everything and took the souls to complete the ritual.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru was then carried to rest by the Demon.</p><p><br><br></p><p></p><p></p><p><br><br></p><p>Two days had passed.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru just woke up from her awakening and the first thing she did was look for her people to see if the process was successful.</p><p><br></p><p>In the meanwhile, my decision to give Razen, Folgen and Shogo to those Oni had been correct.</p><p><br></p><p>Those guys were experts at torture. In fact, even my two Oni girls were quite brutal.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you doing well, Salvatore?” Rimuru asked me when she was free from her work and came to sit by me. She looked tired… but happy.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. Just call me Sal. Salvatore can be a mouthful for many. As for being well… I should be the one asking you. I am not the one who went through a life changing event recently.”</p><p><br></p><p>Actually I did too. Becoming a Dragonoid, Hero Egg User and Housing a True Fucking Dragon of all this can be pretty life changing for most. But let's not mention that.</p><p><br></p><p>“I… yes. I am… surprisingly well. More so than I was expecting. Maybe it’s this monster self. I couldn’t shed tears even when Shizue-chan died. I guess this is what being a monster is like. I have just started to accept it now.” She answered, a shadow of emotion flashing on her face before being covered by her usual cheery look.</p><p><br></p><p>“The worst kinds of pain are those where you can’t even shed tears. As for becoming a monster, in this world, monsters have treated me better than humans so I am a little biassed.” I smiled lightly, making her laugh.</p><p><br></p><p>“You have quite a sweet tongue on you.”</p><p><br></p><p>The atmosphere relaxed quite a bit after this.</p><p><br></p><p>We talked about different things.</p><p><br></p><p>About the common person connecting us, Shizue-sensei.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru told me about her own life.</p><p><br></p><p>She was quite sheltered. She had studied in an All Girls School and College all her life and when she joined the workforce, it made her quite awkward with boys. So, in this life she wanted to overcome this problem of hers.</p><p><br></p><p>She has had friends but mostly girls and she died when trying to save a colleague from a mugger.</p><p><br></p><p>I learned several things about her. She was a massive closet otaku.</p><p><br></p><p>Then I talked about what I did after going independent.</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t believe you named your subordinate, Shanks. Damn, now that I think of it, I could have totally named my subordinates after cool anime characters. I had to spend so much time trying to think through names for them.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah… actually, that was Chloe. She was the one who named him Shanks. I was kinda unconscious then.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, Chloe-chan. Does she like manga too?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, I told them the stories I could remember. It’s been a long time since I had seen those. My previous world didn’t have the same ones.”</p><p><br></p><p>“... your previous world?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, you didn’t know. I was reincarnated in my previous world before being summoned to this one. I thought Shizue-sensei must have told you about this.” Then again, she wouldn’t because this was quite personal. Not that I would have minded if she did.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“So you…are an Isekai protagonist doubled over?”</p><p><br></p><p>“... is that what you got from all this?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I mean I am not wrong. Also, you couldn’t remember manga but you remembered your Eroge? What’s with naming the Dark Elf?”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Shit.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hey… if you know what the name means, you are equally guilty.” I defended myself.</p><p><br></p><p>“Touché.”</p><p><br></p><p>She smiled slyly.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is when I was reminded of something. “By the way, did your world have the Campione Light Novel?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The God Slayer one?” She asked, seconds later.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm. I read that one. Quite interesting.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Highschool DxD?”</p><p><br></p><p>“That Boob-brained idiot main character was too much for me. I could barely pull through half the book without trying to dive into the world and castrate the guy.”</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>“Well yeah.” I couldn’t blame her. It was cringy. Must be even more so from a girl’s perspective.</p><p><br></p><p>“So… why are you asking me about those generic harem novels? Is this your dream? Making a harem in another world? So cliche. Not bad. Still cliche though. I mean you already have four and they are hot…”</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah… she was quite bi-curious. With her entire life in girls’ schools, she… experimented.</p><p><br></p><p>“Actually… recently, in fact just a while ago, one of Hinata’s subordinates… she was called Seishhuin Ena.” Her eyes widened at this.</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t mean…”</p><p><br></p><p>“I do. I even verified.”</p><p><br></p><p>She thought for a moment. “Could be some otaku like us. Roleplaying.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The sword was similar and I verified. But that’s not why I believe she wasn’t lying. Actually… when I was summoned, in my fight against the Demon when I met Shizue-sensei, I awakened… a Sacred Gear.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“You are shitting me.”</p><p><br></p><p>I summoned the Delete Field.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at it and even scanned it with Raphael and then looked at me again. “You are actually shitting me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hey… I was as surprised as you are. I only found out about this because the word Balance Breaker came to mind.”</p><p><br></p><p>The reason I shared this with her was to confirm something.</p><p><br></p><p>Were the novels and anime only from my world?</p><p><br></p><p>If not, then there was a possibility that someone else might know about this world as well… from anime?</p><p><br></p><p>Or was I the only outlier due to my double isekai?</p><p><br></p><p>There were still many things to verify but one thing was clear… this was not the normal world from the novels which I knew about.</p><p><br></p><p>In this case, it’s better to prepare accordingly.</p><p><br></p><p>We discussed the new revelation in detail and she wanted to recruit any people, otherworlders who wandered into this world.</p><p><br></p><p>“Although, this Demon Lord title might be a bit of a problem. Normal isekai characters wouldn’t believe in a Demon Lord, cliches and all…” She said sadly. “Say, how about you make a kingdom for yourself too? Then you can recruit the humans. Actually how about you take over Falmuth. I am not letting those bastards take over the kingdom anyway. It’s better if you make it a place where the otherworlders can live peacefully. I will support you too. The resources from the kingdom will also help you in your goals.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, the idea does have merit. But I don’t think they will agree to a guy just walking in and taking over the kingdom.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, I can help with that. Any normal guy walking in to take the Kingdom might be problematic but a guy who fights off a beautiful and cute Demon Lord who was provoked by their previous king and saves their kingdom and their lives… might be accepted. Moreover you are also a Hero like Hinata. People dig classic blonde pretty boys like you playing the Hero with a Holy Sword and fighting against the Demon Lord or an evil Dragon. Hahahaha I think Veldora might even agree to put on a show.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>I learned another thing about Rimuru today.</p><p><br></p><p>She was crazy.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Kaijin -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the two talking on the roof of the main building of the city, looking happy and smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“They look good together, don’t they, Kaijin?” His brother asked him and he nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“I haven’t seen Rimuru-sama this happy ever, I think.” Kurobe said as he sat beside him.</p><p><br></p><p>The subordinates of Salvatore also smiled at this.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Master looks happy too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you think it was true?” His brother asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“What was true?” Kurobe prodded.</p><p><br></p><p>He smirked.</p><p><br></p><p>The main reason why he followed Miss Rimuru…</p><p><br></p><p>“In the Elf Bar at Dwargon, there is a fortune teller. She did a reading on Miss Rimuru to… find her fated one”</p><p><br></p><p>“WHAT!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Who?”</p><p><br></p><p>Several cries sounded instantly.</p><p><br></p><p>He just looked in the distance at the two figures sitting on the roof.</p><p><br></p><p>It was quite surprising when he saw the face of his newest sworn brother in the crystal ball as he travelled with Shizue-san. Although he didn’t know what the Arthur Pendragon words shouted by Miss Rimuru meant, he was quite sure she liked him too.</p><p><br></p><p>So when she was insulted by that stuck up noble, he did what any responsible brother should do and punched the face of that bastard.</p><p><br></p><p>It led to him being exiled from Dwargon but he didn’t regret it one bit. The purified metal given by Salvatore was all taken by him when he left, leaving nothing for Dwargon.</p><p><br></p><p>And now it seemed that these two were getting along well.</p><p><br></p><p>Behind him, his brothers were telling everyone the story while he chugged his mead celebrating the day.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Hinata -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She walked towards the main chambers where the ruler of the Holy Ruberious Empire was.</p><p><br></p><p>The things that she found in the recent attack were worrying to say the least. There were people involved from within the Holy Empire. The paper Salvatore passed her contained some information which made her doubt some people and when she looked into them, she found that her doubts were not unfounded.</p><p><br></p><p>She could only think of one person who could fix this. She knocked on the door and waited outside to be summoned.</p><p><br></p><p>“Come in, Hinata.” A voice came from inside.</p><p><br></p><p>She pushed the ornate door and entered the room, closing the door behind her.</p><p><br></p><p>The room was dimly lit but with her level of senses, it was no problem. In front of her was a throne and a figure sat on it.</p><p><br></p><p>Silver hair, heterochromia blue and red eyes looked at her as the figure picked up a glass of red liquid and took a sip.</p><p><br></p><p>“How was your visit to that damn lizard’s lair? Did you encounter any problems?” The hatred when she mentioned the lizard was palpable but something she was used to by now.</p><p><br></p><p>“There were… complications.” Yes. She couldn’t think of a better word than that.</p><p><br></p><p>Salvatore was a complicated matter for her. She didn’t even know what to think of him. On one hand, she was sure that he didn’t want to hurt her but still being defeated so easily by him… and when he was protecting someone she doubted of hurting Sensei… but then with all the information she had… complicated was probably the most appropriate word. She was still unsure on what to do about him now.</p><p><br></p><p>Not to mention, Ena was now clamouring to find him after he mentioned her world and friends.</p><p><br></p><p>“You look like you are in a corundum, Hinata. Could it be that the Monster Nation was a problem or did that lizard come out again? No. I haven’t sensed him yet.”</p><p><br></p><p>She shook her head and broke out of the thoughts as she addressed the person in front of her.</p><p><br></p><p>“I couldn’t reach the Monster Nation or take down Rimuru Tempest, the slime who was suspected to be the killer of Shizue Izawa. I was stopped by someone.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! Someone who could stop you?”</p><p><br></p><p>She shook her head. “A human. Another student of my teacher, Shizue Izawa, one she took in two years ago.” She took a deep breath before. “He told me the slime, Rimuru Tempest is a Reincarnated Human who was reincarnated in the body of a slime and not exactly a monster born from the Storm Dragon, Veldora’s magicules. She became friends with Shizue-sensei and devoured her body to fulfil her last wish.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Did your fellow student give you any proof?”</p><p><br></p><p>“... he didn’t have any reason to lie. I…was at his mercy the whole time.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What!”</p><p><br></p><p>“I lost to him… easily. I didn’t even last a minute and that’s when he didn’t even move from his spot or attack. He just caught my sword and then used a Skill to render me immobile. He told me that Sensei was already at the end of her life and wanted to pass on. Since then Rimuru Tempest has used her power to keep the Monsters in check and even help Humans. I confirmed the news through my own investigation. This attack was due to false information from the Human Nation Falmuth who were losing business due to the Monster Nation opening up a road through the Jura Forest.”</p><p><br></p><p>She handed the file in which she had collected all the information.</p><p><br></p><p>Demon Lord’s Haki flared from the body of the figure in front of her as more pages of the file were slowly turned. In her mind, she couldn’t help but compare the powers of the Haki she had felt from Salvatore and found that he was stronger, if only slightly.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally after a while, she kept the file aside and reigned in the Haki as she picked up her glass for another sip. “So Rimuru Tempest has ascended as a Demon Lord?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No wonder a Walpurgis was called. Clayman probably had a hand in this too. One can never be sure with that slimy cretin. I will meet this Rimuru myself and see everything at Walpurgis.”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, the junior of yours, what’s his name?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Salvatore.”</p><p><br></p><p><em>Crack</em></p><p><br></p><p>The glass in the figure’s hand shattered instantly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Describe him clearly. His looks and Skills, everything.” The figure asked and Hinata sensed a change in the atmosphere suddenly.</p><p><br></p><p>“He has blonde hair, blue eyes and is almost as tall as me. He wielded a sword which was completely white in colour but lit up with golden holy flames when he wielded it. Although, he never used it against me. I think it could be a Legend, probably a God Ranked Sword. He also possessed enormous amounts of magicules and is probably a Saint and a Hero too. I am not sure if he’s already awakened but his Magicules were almost at your own level.” She thought of everything she could and then added a few more things.</p><p><br></p><p>The figure in front of her took deep breaths as if trying to calm down.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is something the matter?”</p><p><br></p><p>“You were not wrong to lose against him, Hinata. This is a man she…” The figure paused. “So he’s finally come. You said he was close to Rimuru Tempest?”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good. Then I will see what kind of a person this Salvatore is for her to choose him.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you know Salvatore? Could he be lying?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“We… have a common acquaintance. As for him being a liar, no. From what I know about him, he is not a liar. The information he gave you should all be true.”</p><p><br></p><p>She wanted to ask more but was stopped.</p><p><br></p><p>“I want to take some rest Hinata.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay.” She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Milim -</strong></p><p><br></p><p><em>Crash</em></p><p><br></p><p>She smiled inwardly as she saw Clayman destroying his stuff. Rimuru won. As she had expected of her bestie.</p><p><br></p><p>“Useless. All of them, useless. They couldn’t even do a simple thing. How hard could it be to fight against a slime?”</p><p><br></p><p>“T-t-t-there were several strong majin with them too. And the reinforcements from the Western Holy Church led by Hinata Sakaguchi were stopped alone by Salvatore, another student of Shizue Izawa. Salvatore stepped in when Hinata Sakaguchi was going to kill the slime and… subdued her effortlessly. All our information regarding him was wrong.”</p><p><br></p><p>Oh ho? Sal was there too and he saved Rimuru’s life.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why? Why would he fight for a slime?”</p><p><br></p><p>“H-he was initially summoned by the Falmuth Nation and kept under a Lock Curse. They thought he had died but he was taken away by Shizue Izawa. He brought several High Level Majin with him to assist Monster Nation Tempest against the Falmuth Army. We lost contact with Pirone after that so no further information was gained.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Dammit. Why does this man have to mess up all my plans? First, Yamza, then Mjurran and now Pirone too.”</p><p><br></p><p>Milim controlled her smile again.</p><p><br></p><p>“Call for the Hidden Hand.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, Sir.”</p><p><br></p><p>“If Milim was not needed, I could have sent her to take care of that fool but Kagali-sama has taken a shine to him somehow.”</p><p><br></p><p>A minute later, five people entered the room.</p><p><br></p><p>The one in the lead was an old man with glasses and black priest garbs. He had silver hair and a lean figure. He looked similar to one other Dragon Faithful in the way he walked. The only difference is that he was a human.</p><p><br></p><p>A warrior maybe.</p><p><br></p><p>The other was a young man with long black hair who was with a grey haired woman. The man was a human who wore priest garbs and wielded a holy sword while the woman was a Demon… no she was slightly different from a Demon. They seemed quite close.</p><p><br></p><p>The fourth was a girl around her own height. A vampire with blonde hair and red eyes. She looked blankly out of the room.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, the last one was a girl with dark brown hair and two purple triangle marks on her cheeks. On looking closer, Milim saw that she had something sealed inside her. Some kind of monster looking like a turtle.</p><p><br></p><p>One thing common about all of them was the fact that each one of them had a lock spell cast on them using Clayman’s Unique Skill, Manipulator. The brown haired girl had her heart replaced by the same thing that other Majin had.</p><p><br></p><p>So these were the Hidden Hand which she had heard of.</p><p><br></p><p>They looked pretty normal to her. She could agree that they were quite strong for normal people but how could they ever hope to match the most awesome Demon Lord, Milim Nava.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked as Clayman ordered them to trouble Sal and capture him, getting no response from them. Ah, they were resisting but Clayman was controlling them.</p><p><br></p><p>He probably bound them one the day they were summoned.</p><p><br></p><p>If not for that, the five of them could have totally wiped the floor with him.</p><p><br></p><p>Eh, it wouldn’t matter anyway. Not like they would be able to defeat Sal.</p><p><br></p><p>After Clayman left, the five stayed in the room and the old man sighed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Salvatore, an otherworlder. Sounds like an Italian name.” He said, looking at the black haired man who nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do we really have to fight against a child, maybe even from our own world Shiro-san?” He clenched his fingers.</p><p><br></p><p>The old man approached her and patted her head and looked at her with a sad gaze. “I don’t want to do so either, Masaomi-kun. In fact if it were up to me, if I could….” He tried to bring his hand towards her necklace before he was shot back and bled lightly from the corner of his mouth. The spell cast on him was far stronger than normal Lock Spells. “Children should be protected, no matter the cost.”</p><p><br></p><p>“U-um, she is a Demon Lord , I think.” The brown haired girl said as she put her hand on his chest as green light flashed and slowly the old man got better.</p><p><br></p><p>“Children are children. I have raised the sons of literal Satan and I can tell you that their races don’t matter. Each child should be given a chance at a good life.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I wish we had more people like you in our world, Shiro-san. Just give me some more time. As long as I can completely analyse the spell, I can break it. We just need to bide for our time.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then I will leave it to you, Cleria-san.” The old man got up and looked at Milim with a sad gaze. “I am sorry.” Before sighing.</p><p><br></p><p>“Come, Aletia-chan.” The brown haired girl led the blonde vampire out too.</p><p><br></p><p>When they had left, Frey spoke up. “They seemed like good people. But they were strong. Do you think your new friend will be fine?”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded. “It’s fine. Sal is strong.”</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Both Rimuru and Sal are strong. Very strong.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Salvatore -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>An hour or so later, we were done talking and just lay on the roof, watching the stars.</p><p><br></p><p>A time of peace was rare and I wanted to enjoy it.</p><p><br></p><p>We sensed a presence walking towards us and soon, Rimuru’s subordinate, Shuna came up. “Rimuru-sama, Salvatore-sama. Dinner is ready. Where will you two be eating?”</p><p><br></p><p>I waited for Rimuru’s choice who got up with a mischievous smile on her face. “Race you to the dining room. The last one there is a rotten egg.” She shouted suddenly as she jumped down.</p><p><br></p><p>I laughed at the girl’s antics and got up myself. “Sure.”</p><p><br></p><p>A minute later, I entered the dining room following her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha, I won.” She cheered as she sat down at the head of the table.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, yes you did.” I smiled, raising my hands in faux surrender.</p><p><br></p><p>This peaceful atmosphere was broken by a voice in my head.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>The Ultimate Skill Leviathan was stimulated by the loss.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>The only thought in my head before I fainted was…</p><p><br></p><p>“You’ve got to be shitting me.”</p><p><br></p><p>________________________________x__________________________________________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am back with another chapter of ‘To be a Hero.’</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Too many things happened in this chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Hinata got owned.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>We encountered some otherworlders and had some idea about what kind of world this was.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ruminas seems to know about Sal.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>And now the Hidden Hand are given the task to capture Sal.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>How is all of this going to end up?</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>",

My mind ran at its fastest to remember the situation I was in before losing consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>The last thing I could remember was getting angry at Charybdis, Clayman and the entire fucking situation.</p><p><br></p><p>And then it was as if my vision turned red.</p><p><br></p><p>The rest was a bit hazy.</p><p><br></p><p>How did I get here though?</p><p><br></p><p>Did the ogre carry me?</p><p><br></p><p>I looked around and then saw that things looked much clearer to me than before. It was like the entire world was in high definition now.</p><p><br></p><p>I felt the changes in my body and stood up on my bed to inspect myself.</p><p><br></p><p>I noticed that I was wearing unfamiliar clothes.</p><p><br></p><p>Apart from that, I seemed to have grown a few inches taller. I clenched my fists and I could feel my strength surging through my body.</p><p><br></p><p>It was way beyond anything I had experienced before. So much so that it made my previous level look like a joke compared to what I was now.</p><p><br></p><p>The second thing I noticed about myself was my magicules.</p><p><br></p><p>I already had a very decent amount of Magicules before but now… I felt as if my magicules were inexhaustible.</p><p><br></p><p>The only conclusion I could come to was that I evolved when the fight was over.</p><p><br></p><p>Is this the power of a Saint?</p><p><br></p><p>My awakening was sensed by others as the room was opened and to my surprise, what flew in seemed like a pixie or a fairy of sorts.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, you’re awake.” She flew around me and looked me up and down. “Umm good good. You are fine now.”</p><p><br></p><p>It was a little awkward being stared like this by a palm sized pixie. “Who are you?” I asked, already having an idea of her identity.</p><p><br></p><p>“Me? Hahahaha open your eyes and be grateful to be in the presence of the strongest Demon Lord. I am the Demon Lord, Ramiris.”</p><p><br></p><p>Thought so.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh? Strongest? But wasn’t the strongest Demon Lord, Guy Crimson?” I pretended to simply play along with her funny shenanigans.</p><p><br></p><p>“Guy! What about Guy? I can blast him off with a punch. Boom Kaboom and all done.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh. That’s awesome. Here, have a candy.” I brought out a small candy from my pocket but realised that for her, this might as well be her entire meal.</p><p><br></p><p>She quickly grabbed the candy from my fingers.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good. You know how to respect your seniors.”</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled and just shook my head at her antics. She was funny.</p><p><br></p><p>Just then I remembered my purpose for coming to this place. “Lady Ramiris. Is my student, I mean the girl who was with me, Chloe, is she?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes yes. She is all well now. Also that Kijin that was following you. She made a contract with an unknown spirit and is resting now.”</p><p><br></p><p>I felt a heavy burden being lifted from my shoulders as I bowed down to her. “Thank you, for saving our lives.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh? I didn’t do anything. Your spirits chose you two by themselves. I just gave you both my blessing, as I was required to. It’s what I do for every person who gets blessed by a Light or Darkness Spirit of an Elemental Lord Rank or above. It is my job to grant Hero Egg to those who qualify. It was Milim who saved you. She carried you three or rather four here for help. She is currently sleeping outside.”</p><p><br></p><p>The words left me stilled for a moment.</p><p><br></p><p>Chloe got a contract with an unknown spirit as I was suspecting.</p><p><br></p><p>It was the other part which surprised me.</p><p><br></p><p>I got a spirit contract too?</p><p><br></p><p>And a Hero Egg which meant that I got either a Light or Darkness Spirit.</p><p><br></p><p>And Milim?</p><p><br></p><p>Just what in the fuck happened when I lost consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>“The Kijin you brought is sitting outside if you ask. As for my fees. Make me more of these.” She raised the candy in her arms before taking another lick of it. “Sweet.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded and did just that. A little outside the room was where I found the ogre who was now a… Kijin, sitting on the ground with his blade on his lap, meditating.</p><p><br></p><p>When did he evolve?</p><p><br></p><p>I pushed the thoughts from my head aside and went before him. He sensed my presence and opened his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Benefactor, you are awake?” He stood up quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, yes… I just woke up a few minutes ago. You can sit. I… just wanted to ask what is going on here?” I finally completed the question in utter confusion.</p><p><br></p><p>In the next hour or so, the guy explained to me what had happened since I asked him to protect Chloe and went on to fight Charybdis.</p><p><br></p><p>Charybdis was being healed by Clayman’s minions.</p><p><br></p><p>Milim came in and knocked her out and I went out of control and killed Charybdis and then tried to attack Milim. I felt a severe chill at this.</p><p><br></p><p>I tried to attack Milim!</p><p><br></p><p>How am I still alive?</p><p><br></p><p>Ah, apparently I was backhanded into the ground by her and Chloe saved my life by making a trade with Milim.</p><p><br></p><p>I found myself open-mouthed at the thought that a joke of a lesson on what to do with which Demon Lord had actually saved my life.</p><p><br></p><p>“What about Chloe?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Miss Chloe was looking after you when you were asleep. She is resting now.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see.” Now, I was feeling bad. I not only got her in trouble but now even my life was saved by her.</p><p><br></p><p>I shook my head to get my thoughts in line.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you for your help… ah.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Shanks.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Shanks. Miss Chloe named me Shanks. She used the naming to reduce the Magicules in her body. She said that you would like it.”</p><p><br></p><p>… that works?</p><p><br></p><p>Fuck, why didn’t I think of that before?</p><p><br></p><p>I could have taken a much safer route if I had known.</p><p><br></p><p>Not to mention the students could have been safer for a long time.</p><p><br></p><p>“Benefactor… you don’t like the name?”</p><p><br></p><p>I was broken from my thoughts by the guy’s voice. “Wha? No. I like it. Shanks is the name of one of the bravest… ughh, warriors of the sea. He could stop entire armies with just his presence. Yes. Shanks is a good name. With what you have done for us, I would name you Shanks too.”</p><p><br></p><p>And with just those words, a light enveloped him.</p><p><br></p><p>Wait, what the fuck happened?</p><p><br></p><p>I felt a slight drain in my reserves which became full almost the same time.</p><p><br></p><p> instantaneously.</p><p><br></p><p>I felt his power rise and just a few minutes later, there stood in front of me, a handsome redheaded guy who made Charybdis look like a kid.</p><p><br></p><p>I am pretty sure he could beat Charybdis if he fought it now.</p><p><br></p><p>Did I accidentally name him again?</p><p><br></p><p>He kneeled on the ground. “Thank you for your benevolence, Great Benefactor.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A-ah, sure. Take some rest. I will go and see Chloe first.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will guard the room.”</p><p><br></p><p>I entered the room first while keeping the need to get used to my powers at the back of my head.</p><p><br></p><p>I needed to see if Chloe was fine or not.</p><p><br></p><p>Inside the room was a strange sight. It was cute to be honest and I wish I had a camera. Two cute girls were snuggling with each other and sleeping. One of them was a familiar brunette while the other was a pink haired girl with twin tails who was drooling while sleeping.</p><p><br></p><p>The demonic power inside her though… It was huge!</p><p><br></p><p>It was probably the biggest power reserve I had ever seen in any being in this world.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t need any introductions to know who she was.</p><p><br></p><p>Milim Nava.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the oldest Demon Lords in the world.</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing them both sleeping like this, I didn’t have the heart to disturb them and went out to test my powers.</p><p><br></p><p>I could <em>feel</em> the difference between my previous self and my current self right now. My Skills had completely changed.</p><p><br></p><p>I needed to get used to them first before anything else.</p><p><br></p><p>It was times like these where I really envied Rimuru for having a hax like Raphael.</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I asked for an area where I could practise my Skills without worry and Ramiris easily provided me with a room for the small price of a candy.</p><p><br></p><p>The room was made with her Intrinsic Skill, The Small World which could create pocket dimensions anywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>In this room, I didn’t need to hold back and I used all my abilities.</p><p><br></p><p>The Fool has changed into Leviathan, Lord of Envy. An Ultimate Skill.</p><p><br></p><p>This Skill consists of several sub Skills but the main ones were The Fool and the main power which could degrade the Skills of opponents and absorb their energies to replenish mine.</p><p><br></p><p>The second Skill was Astarte, Lord of Creation which was a combination of Evolver and Creator on fucking steroids.</p><p><br></p><p>There was also the Skill which Leviathan copied from Milim after I supposedly <em>lost</em> to her, Satanael, Lord of Wrath. This made my magicules endless as long as I was angry.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a Skill which enabled Milim to fight at levels surpassing True Dragons even when she only had ten percent of their power in the normal state.</p><p><br></p><p>My body couldn’t bear the power of this Skill so it was kept in a partly sealed state.</p><p><br></p><p>It was the last Skill which made me realize that I had fucked things up beyond realization.</p><p><br></p><p>Uriel, Lord of Vows.</p><p><br></p><p>Wasn’t this like Rimuru’s Skill?</p><p><br></p><p>The butterflies it would cause were almost endless.</p><p><br></p><p>I sat down for a while to think about the situation for a while and what I was going to do going forward?</p><p><br></p><p>I later realised that there was no point mopping about this. The world changed the moment I entered.</p><p><br></p><p>My main goal was to find a way back home. If I can get Rimuru’s help with it, good and all. If not… I will just do what I have been doing all this time.</p><p><br></p><p>Work.</p><p><br></p><p>Train.</p><p><br></p><p>Get stronger.</p><p><br></p><p>And make a fucking way.</p><p><br></p><p>There was also an intrinsic Skill called the Magicule Breeder Reactor which I vaguely remember as being an endgame level Skill. It was like an infinite energy generator which continuously produced magicules for me. This was probably the reason why I didn’t feel any drain even after naming… Shanks.</p><p><br></p><p>The last but not the least was my Spirit.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, wasn’t that a surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>She was a Darkness Spirit instead of a Light one. I would have thought that me wielding my holy sword would have pushed me towards the light alignment but I guess Vritra being stuck to me would also tilt the balance to the other side.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked, huh… how to describe her. If I had to name a character, then it would be Restia Ashdoll. Yup She looked like Restia Ashdoll who was also a Darkness Spirit.</p><p><br></p><p>Quite cliche but who cares.</p><p><br></p><p>Our contract gave me a Darkness affinity and I could apparently fuse with her to temporarily increase my power beyond my current state, quite similar to my Balance Breaker.</p><p><br></p><p>For that matter, I tried to use the Vritra Ultimate Skill but it was somehow not available, so I let it be.</p><p><br></p><p>I absolutely had no idea what kind of being Vritra was because I could never quite communicate with it except for some instinctive feelings sometimes.</p><p><br></p><p>There were still things that I didn’t know about, like the Hero Egg but one step at a time.</p><p><br></p><p>I would need some time to fully get used to my powers and learn to use them efficiently in battle.</p><p><br></p><p>All this said, I was finally <em>something</em> in this world. Although nothing compared to the top levels but not something anyone can ignore either.</p><p><br></p><p>A few hours later, I came out of the place only to be greeted by an over-excited Demon Lord to my face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hey, you can make candied fruits, right? Make them for me. Quick, quick!” She flew around me quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>Behind her was Chloe who was walking towards me and hugged me quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>I pat her head slowly. “Are you alright now?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Good. Thank you for saving my life,Chloe. You are my Hero.” I smiled at the girl who hugged me tighter.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hey, hey, hey, what about me? I saved your life too, you know? What about me?” The pink haired Demon Lord flew around me throwing a tantrum.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, how could I forget. Thank you for your help too, Lady Milim.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh, Lady? I am just Milim. Call me just that. You will be my Rival from now on. I can’t have you calling me Lady and what not.”</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>“What?”</p><p><br></p><p>“You will become a Hero and my rival like Guy and Rudra.” She haughtily placed a hand on her waist and said proudly. It looked funny when she was trying to puff her chest out but the knowledge of who she is made the scene turn from comedy to horror very quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>Just to make sure, I asked again to confirm. “Excuse me?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah jeez. You are also a Dragonoid like me. In fact, you are the only other Dragonoid I know of. I am a Demon Lord and you are a Hero, so you will be my Rival and when I win you will make Candied Fruits for me… ah umm, and I mean I will win.”</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>There were so many things in that statement that I wanted to question but I started from the most important one first. “I am a what now?”</p><p><br></p><p>“A Dragonoid. A Half-Human, Half Dragon. I am also one and we are the only two Dragonoids in existence.”</p><p><br></p><p>I found myself with an open mouth before shaking myself to ask the second question. “Wait, I thought I became a Saint. What about that?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh… Dragonoids can become Saints too, you know. You are both.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah… ok-ay. Thank you for your help, Milim.” I opened my pocket space and brought some of the candied fruits and other sweets I stocked up and saw Milim’s eyes shining. “Share some of them with Lady Ramiris too.” I gave her a large part while giving the rest to Chloe.</p><p><br></p><p>We sat in the room while they ate. Ramiris joined the party too and picked up the sweets. I even gave some to the poor guy Shanks who was dragged in all this mess without his consent.</p><p><br></p><p>“So Clayman’s people attacked and they somehow knew I was going to pass that way. I thought it was his territory and I met them only by coincidence but now it seems that it was not so.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s not his territory, you know. This entire country is my territory. Clayman can only pass through the area but can never claim it as his own or I would show him my super punch and…” Ramiris started her shadow boxing in the air.</p><p><br></p><p>That only made things worse.</p><p><br></p><p>It could only mean that I was targeted by either Yuuki, which was unlikely or his assistant, that elf.</p><p><br></p><p>The Harlequin Alliance and Clayman.</p><p><br></p><p>Those bastards almost caused the loss of Chloe’s life.</p><p><br></p><p>I clenched my fists in anger but took a deep breath and controlled myself first.</p><p><br></p><p>This was not the time to get angry.</p><p><br></p><p>First, I need to get my other students out of that place and let them make contracts with Spirits to solve their problems as well. Anything else would come later.</p><p><br></p><p>I just asked something first, in case I was getting way over my head. “If I were to fight and kill Clayman now, would any of the other Demon Lords interfere?”</p><p><br></p><p>The two Demon Lords in attendance looked at me and then at each other and then back at me again. “No. Why would we? If he lost, it meant he was weak. Heroes and Demon Lords are always fated to encounter each other. They will always meet at some point in time. What they do after that is none of their business. Leon-chan fought Curse Lord Kazeram and killed him and even awakened as a True Hero and despite this, he became a Demon Lord in the council. We don’t interfere in such matters. The council was formed to solve matters between two Demon Lords before matters escalated too much.” Ramiris explained everything to me.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, if I were to kill Clayman, there would be no problem?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm. There would be some problems. Clayman has considerable forces and they would go around causing problems everywhere if they were not controlled.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Wait wait wait. I wanted to pull a prank on Clayman.” Milim interrupted us. “You see. I was going to go to Clayman to pull a prank on him after I left here. He has been acting very meanly to one of my new friends and I wanted to punch him in the face first but decided to trick him and then let… ah, that’s a surprise.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Then why did you tell us the first part?</p><p><br></p><p>“So, do you mind if I kill him after your surprise?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>If those bastards attacked me once, they could attack me again. It’s better to eliminate such risks.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, okay. But… I will need more Candied Fruits…” She said, eying me with a sly look in her eyes. I had the urge to facepalm but stopped myself and nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>Thus we began to make plans for Clayman’s demise.</p><p><br></p><p>He was going to die either way, it would be better to not leave things to chance.</p><p><br></p><p>“Where is that prisoner?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, that puppet? She’s locked up. Clayman can see and hear through her so I knocked her out.” Milim replied casually.</p><p><br></p><p>I was led to the place where the said servant was locked. She had light blue hair and looked like a young woman. She was knocked out as Milim had stated.</p><p><br></p><p>Shanks had informed me that she was called Mjurran and was one of the Five Fingers, Clayman’s commanders along with the guy I cut off that day.</p><p><br></p><p>Not all of Clayman’s subordinates were as loyal to him as the Harlequins. In fact, most of them were people he had either tricked or enslaved with his Skill.</p><p><br></p><p>If she had a crest on her, she was probably one of those too.</p><p><br></p><p>This brought back the memories from Farmuth Kingdom, of how I was forced to kill against my will and made me sympathise towards the Majin… just a little bit maybe.</p><p><br></p><p>If she was indeed in such a situation, I would let her go. If not…</p><p><br></p><p>First things first. I need Clayman to be in the dark about this so first let’s look at the part which allows him to spy on us through his servants.</p><p><br></p><p>I used Astarte’s Analyze on her and the information regarding her appeared in my head. All the details of her being were analysed in a moment.</p><p><br></p><p>It made me realise again what kind of utter cheats Ultimate Skills were.</p><p><br></p><p>I carefully picked out the parts of the spells which allowed Clayman to control and spy over her and the failsafe in case she ever got out of his control and then used my other Ultimate Skill: Uriel to negate the parts of those spells.</p><p><br></p><p>The negation powers of Negation Zone had been buffed to high heavens and could negate any kind of Magic and Skill except a higher Ranked Ultimate Skill, maybe.</p><p><br></p><p>It took some time but the Marionette Heart Spell was completely undone now and was only remaining to provide her with life.</p><p><br></p><p>For Clayman, she must be dead now if he checked.</p><p><br></p><p>“She’s safe. I am waking her up.”</p><p><br></p><p>They nodded and I did.</p><p><br></p><p>The woman opened her eyes and looked around in confusion before her eyes widened. She probably realised the situation she was in and was scared.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have removed the spell Clayman had over you. He cannot control you anymore, nor can he kill you. You don’t have to worry about him. Just answer the questions we ask and you can leave if we are satisfied. Do you understand?”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked quite scared and Shanks spoke up first.</p><p><br></p><p>“Miss Mjurran, my benefactor is not lying. He freed me and helped me too. If you tell us what he wants to know, he will let you go.”</p><p><br></p><p>She shakily looked at us and nodded so I asked everything about Clayman that I could. His armies, his bases, his skills, the Skills of his subordinates.</p><p><br></p><p>“His main forces are the Five Fingers, at least for the world. What people don’t know is that he also has five summoned otherworlder’s whom he controls in secret. Each of them has the strength of an Enlightened. They are his Hidden Hand and are even stronger than us but…”</p><p><br></p><p>“But?”</p><p><br></p><p>“They are under the Lock Spell and Heart Curse, being forced to work for him. They might leave him the first chance they get and even turn on him.”</p><p><br></p><p>The Hidden Hand?</p><p><br></p><p>Summoned Otherworlders?</p><p><br></p><p>I had no memory of this.</p><p><br></p><p>But then I recalled that the future had already changed a lot due to my presence and that was assuming that this was the exact world I remembered from the stories. These kinds of waves were to be expected.</p><p><br></p><p>“Who else?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The rest of his forces are planning for an attack on Demon Lord Carrion’s country after he somehow eliminates Demon Lord Carrion. I don’t know how he plans to do so. He then plans to put the blame of this on another monster who is the leader of the newly established Monster Nation of Jura Forest.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That bastard Clayman! I am going to punch his face.” Milim got up in anger, scaring the already frightened Majin out of her skin.</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully, Chloe had learned the art of taming a Dragonoid as she offered her a lollipop and she was pacified.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the duo in utter awe.</p><p><br></p><p>They were becoming the best of friends all of a sudden.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry, Milim. We are going to kick his teeth in. We just need to prepare your master plan first.”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded and sat down, far too busy with her lollipop to bother.</p><p><br></p><p>I noticed that she didn’t lie about anything and asked her about how she got in the service of Clayman.</p><p><br></p><p>Turns out that she was a Human Witch who lived by herself in the Jura Forest. She was nearing her death so she approached Clayman who was recruiting back then.</p><p><br></p><p>He implanted her with the heart of a Majin which helped him both control her and transform her into a Majin. If she ever removed the heart, she would turn back into her previous human form and die.</p><p><br></p><p>As a reclusive witch who didn’t have much human interaction, she was unable to see through Clayman’s trick back then and had suffered under him for several hundred years already.</p><p><br></p><p>Milim’s Eye and Milims Ear can verify any lie in her statement and she didn’t lie even once.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So, are you going to fight them?” Ramiris asked me this time.</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“There are still three of the Five Fingers left, not to mention the Hidden Hand. If each has the strength of an Enlightened, it would be a decent army. Are you sure you want to face them alone?”</p><p><br></p><p>I knew that I could wreck them all by myself but this is a world where even True Dragons can be sealed. I didn’t want to take any unnecessary risks until I was completely used to my powers.</p><p><br></p><p>Ramiris seemed to have understood my thought and offered a suggestion. “You could always recruit people, you know. I am pretty sure that many would follow you without a doubt.”</p><p><br></p><p>Shanks chimed in. “I would swear my sword at your command, benefactor.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will fight for Sensei too.” Chloe looked towards me with conviction and I caressed her head.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you, Chloe, but let’s find some other help. It will still take some time for Milim to arrange everything. We could, maybe, make some new friends. Shanks, do you know of anyone we could recruit?” I asked him.</p><p><br></p><p>“I…” The woman in front of us spoke and we looked at her. She continued nervously. “Can I join you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“You want to join me?”</p><p><br></p><p>“She nodded.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Why?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I… I want to fight Clayman, at least once.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm sure.”</p><p><br></p><p>She kneeled in front of me, bowing.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wait wait. I… don’t want you to do all that swearing and all. I… when I was summoned to this world, I was also enslaved against my will. I… was forced to do things that I detested and absolutely abhorred. So I… I know how it feels to be in such a place. I won’t bind you or anything but if you are working for me, all I ask is for your loyalty and in return, I will never abandon you.” I offered her my hand and she accepted it.</p><p><br></p><p>“Welcome to the team… Mjurran.”</p><p><br></p><p>I thought of something and then continued. “I name you, Mjurran.”</p><p><br></p><p>And sure enough, a bright light enveloped her and I could sense her power rising.</p><p><br></p><p>My energy reserves on the other hand didn’t seem to change much.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked like a deer caught in the headlights.</p><p><br></p><p>She then collected herself and bowed to me. “Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>Finally we discussed a few things and I decided to go and bring my students back and get them contracted to Spirits first. Better to get the time bomb off of them.</p><p><br></p><p>Chloe will go with me while Shanks and Mjurran will search for potential recruits and come back to meet us. Milim will go out to prepare for her prank.</p><p><br></p><p>With that in mind, all of us left for our destinations.</p><p><br></p><p>Clayman had no idea who he messed with.</p><p><br></p><p>____________________________________________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I was out for twelve days.</p><p><br></p><p>While flying towards the Freedom Academy, I never realised it.</p><p><br></p><p>But apparently, my transformation from Human to Dragonoid took a lot longer than I had expected.</p><p><br></p><p>I couldn't say anything because there were no precedents for Dragonoid Saints either.</p><p><br></p><p>It led to several awkward questions about how I became one or how I had a Dragon Soul inside me.</p><p><br></p><p>I answered honestly because there was no use in lying.</p><p><br></p><p>Milim would detect it either way.</p><p><br></p><p>I only found out about the time when I asked for the date.</p><p><br></p><p>Add to it the seven days I had taken to reach the place and I was quite late.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly, I couldn't wait for anything. There was a chance that one of my other students would encounter the same situation as Chloe and without me, there would be next to no hope for them.</p><p><br></p><p>I used my new Dragonoid Transformation which gave me a pair of awesome wings in what Milim called 'Assault Mode'.</p><p><br></p><p>It consisted of me getting a Dragon Tail, a pair of horns, armoured claws, boots and chest plates and a pair of Dragon Wings, all grey in colour.</p><p><br></p><p>It was quite similar to Milim’s Assault Mode in terms of looks but with two horns instead of one.</p><p><br></p><p>I casted several barriers around Chloe and me before I raced through the air towards the Freedom Academy.</p><p><br></p><p>The distance which had previously taken me around seven days to cover, was now covered in eight hours. The sheer difference between just my physical stats is crazy.</p><p><br></p><p>I think I could accelerate more with the help of my magicules.</p><p><br></p><p>When Vritra wakes up, I will try to use my Balance Breaker and see where my strength stands now.</p><p><br></p><p>I made us land some distance away from the city to avoid questions and we walked from there.</p><p><br></p><p>I sensed several people in the guild but surprisingly Yuuki was absent from the guild when I reached the place. The teachers of the academy were extremely surprised to see me. I saw Carter among the people there and went forward.</p><p><br></p><p>“Salvatore. You are back and Chloe… you are fine. But how I mean, I am glad you are fine. Congratulations. It’s just that it has never been done before so I was a bit surprised.” He corrected himself quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sensei saved me.” Chloe answered.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at me. “People would kill for the information on how you did it. You have no idea how many Human Nations try summoning and don’t continue because they only summon kids. They would pay any kind of…”</p><p><br></p><p>“And I will make them pay that price if they start kidnapping children from their home worlds. I am not telling anyone anything. Where are the other children?” I interrupted his words and he abruptly shut his mouth, realising just what he was saying.</p><p><br></p><p>The summoning cycle can change between 33 years to 80 years depending on the degree of success. The more the difference, the lower the chances of summoning children. He was not lying when he said that they would do anything to obtain the information on how to summon children too because while they might not get Unique Skills too quickly, or ever, they possessed a great amount of Magicules to make for good soldiers. And children can be indoctrinated to their train of thought too.</p><p><br></p><p>“I apologise. I didn’t mean it that way.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I know you didn’t, Carter. Just don’t let your interest in magic cross the lines. Now, where are my other students?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah they… were recently taken away by a new teacher called Rimuru Tempest. They had a rocky start and the children were just waiting for you to return but after a week or two, they became fond of the new teacher and went on a journey. They only told me that they trust the new teacher and passed on the information you gave them.”</p><p><br></p><p>So he came.</p><p><br></p><p>I guess not everything changed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm okay. In that case I will leave for a while too. I will take Chloe with me and return in a while again. Tell them that I was back, okay.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. But really, are you going to leave so soon again? You just got here.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I need to do some work, Carter. I will be back.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Take care of yourself, Sal.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will.”</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>Since they left for the Dwelling of the Spirits, it was better to leave Chloe there with Ramiris first, to wait for others. I didn’t know which path they would take or when they would reach there so no point in waiting.</p><p><br></p><p>In the meanwhile, I left with Mjurran and Shanks to go and search for some recruits.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- One week Later -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Is this the kingdom of Ballachia?” I asked a person on the road who answered in the affirmative.</p><p><br></p><p>I thought about some potential places to recruit people from and one of the best places I could think of was from Slave Traders.</p><p><br></p><p>Obviously, I wouldn’t buy them. I am too poor.Rather destroy the Slave Traders and free the people and see if I could recruit any of the freed people.</p><p><br></p><p>From Mjurran’s information, finding the location of one such place was not hard.</p><p><br></p><p>I chose this one because they used monsters from Jura Forest as slaves.</p><p><br></p><p>“The Orthrus Slave Trading organization is that way.” Mjurran led us while we were under disguise.</p><p><br></p><p>These people dealt with slaves, drugs, weapons and everytype of illegal thing there was.</p><p><br></p><p>I found a small alleyway and summoned lesser Darkness Elementals to spy and find out the location of the Slaves so that they don’t get harmed in fights.</p><p><br></p><p>Upon getting the information, I led the two and surrounded the place but before we could attack, there was an explosion in the distance.</p><p><br></p><p>A fight?</p><p><br></p><p>Doesn’t matter though.</p><p><br></p><p>“Attack.” I ordered.</p><p><br></p><p>All three of us attacked the place from three directions, breaking the walls of the building where the slaves were being held. There were around seventy slaves there from one look. They were of different races from Treants to elementals, Tengu, Gozu, Mezu, Elves, Lizardmen and even a fucking Dryad who was captured in a crystal like prison along with the Elementals. I thought the Dryads couldn’t be moved around from the Jura Forest.</p><p><br></p><p>How the fuck did they do that?</p><p><br></p><p>It doesn’t matter.</p><p><br></p><p>“Greater Elemental Summoning: Cerberus.”</p><p><br></p><p>A three headed dog appeared from the summoning circle and roared into the air.</p><p><br></p><p>Due to my connection to an Elemental Lord of the Darkness Element, I could summon spirits of the same element but lower rank.</p><p><br></p><p>Cerberus was one of the more dangerous ones and could go up to Special A Rank, same as Ifrit.</p><p><br></p><p>‘Uriel.’ </p><p><br></p><p>My Uriel’s Negation Zone spread all over the place, negating the Lock Spells on all the monsters while Shanks explained to them about the current situation.</p><p><br></p><p>I found out that Shanks was also a resident of the ogre village but the only reason I didn’t tell him about the survivors was because I wasn’t sure that they even survived this time. With all the changes in the world, I couldn’t be sure if the ogres lived after the attack and giving him false hope would be very cruel.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean I could have asked Milim but that could have been suspicious. Despite her playful and generally gullible attitude, she can be terrifyingly sharp at times and I’d rather not manipulate her….ever.</p><p><br></p><p>I am going to visit Rimuru either way and it wouldn’t be too late then.</p><p><br></p><p>It wasn’t much of a fight.</p><p><br></p><p>Shanks almost went insane when he found two Ogres among the captives. After that, it was just a massacre. The monsters who were freed also did the same.</p><p><br></p><p>The Elementals, Elves, the Treants and the Dryad gathered around Cerberus, recognizing it as their leader.</p><p><br></p><p>I removed my Negation Zone to let them fight to their fullest.</p><p><br></p><p>The only ones who were even noteworthy were the two leaders Gohsel and Cockle who were around A Rank. The main reason they could even capture the monsters was because they could use the Anti Magic Area and the Extra Skill of Cockle, Paralyzer.</p><p><br></p><p>I went ahead to the other side to check the cause of the explosion and found a group of adventurers fighting with the slavers.</p><p><br></p><p>The odd thing was the leader of the group. There was just something off about the guy.</p><p><br></p><p>It was like… his actions, no matter how dumb wasn’t registered by the people for what it was and they only praised them.</p><p><br></p><p>Now if it was just his subordinates, I would have written them off as boot-lickers but it wasn’t like that.</p><p><br></p><p>He was praised by even his enemies.</p><p><br></p><p>Was it some sort of Brain Washing Skill? The boy looked very uncomfortable with the attitude himself so I don’t think he was doing so himself.</p><p><br></p><p>The second thing off was the two people following him.</p><p><br></p><p>Those two were strong.</p><p><br></p><p>Like extremely strong.</p><p><br></p><p>Beyond Enlightened… at the level of Saints and yet they were acting like complete noobs.</p><p><br></p><p>“Watch out.” The leader of the group called out to me. A moment later I realised that he was asking me to be careful because someone was using magic to attack me.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t even bother to dodge the spell. My Magic Sense had already registered it and the multiple barriers from Uriel around my body would easily stop it. Not to mention, I still had the Anti-Skill body.</p><p><br></p><p>Just as I had guessed, the spell hit me and did nothing, making all the people stop.</p><p><br></p><p>The group who had raided the place, the group who was being raided, even the civilians, all stopped to look at me in astonishment.</p><p><br></p><p>Huh, that spell was strong. The area around me, even the building was completely blown to smithereens but I was in the middle of the explosion completely unharmed.</p><p><br></p><p><em>‘Black Blaze Flare.’</em></p><p><br></p><p>The attacker who attacked me got caught Black Flames and was erased in a matter of moments.</p><p><br></p><p><em>‘Uriel.’</em></p><p><br></p><p>Shadow Prison trapped every attacker here in the shadow dimension.</p><p><br></p><p>I turned to look towards the group of adventurers who were now looking at me warily while hiding their leader behind them. This time, they looked like their real selves.</p><p><br></p><p>The leader however was oblivious and walked in front of them. “Who are you, Sir?”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked like a Japanese kid. Probably an otherworlder.</p><p><br></p><p>“My name is Salvatore. You don’t look like someone from this world. What is your name?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, my name is Masayuki. Wait. I think I have heard the name Salvatore somewhere before. Ah, you are Slavatore, the student of Shizue Izawa. I know now. Kagurazaka-san told me about you. Are you here for the quest too? I didn’t know you had taken the quest. Or were you perhaps sent by Kagurazaka-san to back us up? Oh, my name is Masayuki Honjou. Nice to meet you. I am a stray Otherworlder.”</p><p><br></p><p>Masayuki Honjou… I seem to recall this name.</p><p><br></p><p>He was an up and coming Hero or something.</p><p><br></p><p>“I came here by myself when I heard of the slave trade here. The quest is still yours. I will just take the ones enslaved to their homes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh okay. But it wouldn’t be fair to you. After all, you did most of the work. In that case, we will submit the quest with your name along with ours. Thank you very much for your help.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded and glanced towards the two party members who stepped back, although their muscles were still strained as they looked at me.</p><p><br></p><p>Are they Yuuki’s people?</p><p><br></p><p>The boy doesn’t look like it. The other two on the other hand… It seems like my decision to recruit more people might just have been right. I was pretty sure I could mop the floor with the two of them but it’s not wise to take unnecessary risks.</p><p><br></p><p>By the end of the day, all of the work was done.</p><p><br></p><p>They took the two leaders with themselves, although not alive.</p><p><br></p><p>Shanks would have probably attacked them if they had tried to take them alive.</p><p><br></p><p>I had over one hundred and twenty freed slaves with me now.</p><p><br></p><p>The ogres were acquaintances of Shanks and followed him while a Dark Elf and a Tengu decided to follow my team.</p><p><br></p><p>The Tengu of this world was descended from an Angel so they had white wings instead of the black ones I knew from the myths of our world.</p><p><br></p><p>The Dark Elf had her tribe killed in the Orc Lord attacks so she decided to follow me.</p><p><br></p><p>As for their names. I gave a name to the Tengu girl which matched her looks quite well. I named her… Jibril.</p><p><br></p><p>She had almost pink hair and a pair of white angelic wings.</p><p><br></p><p>As for the Dark Elf, well, there was only one name which came to my mind from my hidden folders. I named her… Olga Discordia.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, here was the catch.</p><p><br></p><p>Apparently, naming a person with a last name counts as naming them twice.</p><p><br></p><p>So, the Dark Elf who was at C+ Rank at best ended up the same as Shanks, currently my strongest minion… <em>cough cough</em> soldier/subordinate.</p><p><br></p><p>The two subordinates of Shanks were named, Shuten and Ibaraki. Apparently naming has a slight effect on the named one’s appearance if the Namer has an image in mind. The effects are only slight as the Tengu looks slightly more like Jibril, as her hair colour is now pink or rather a shade closer to pink. Olga looks <em>fuller</em> like Olga and the two Oni look like grown up bustier versions of Ibaraki and Shuten from Fate. I didn’t notice it first with Shanks because he was already named by Chloe once while these people were named the first time.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a great harvest.</p><p><br></p><p>Although, I was not done yet.</p><p><br></p><p>There was still one thing I needed to do.</p><p><br></p><p>Two days later, while leading the crowd towards Jura Forest, I took some time off to go a distance away.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a kingdom called Silberia where there was an incident called the 'The Lake Shore dyed Incident'. It was apparently done by a demon.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, I don't exactly remember everything but I know that the said demon was not as dead as the world thought but was rather in the Demon World and had later joined Rimuru.</p><p><br></p><p>I was going to try to summon the demon.</p><p><br></p><p>I was alone for this.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Demon Summoning.\"</p><p><br></p><p>The sacrifice I offered were the lives of the two hundred slave traders who were currently locked inside my Shadow Prison Realm of Uriel.</p><p><br></p><p>A figure formed in front of me. White hair, red eyes and a noble look. She was strong.</p><p><br></p><p>Stronger than any of my subordinates, far stronger than the Greater daemon I defeated years ago for my Enlightenment.</p><p><br></p><p>Arch-Daemon and red eyes so… a Primordial.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Are you the one who summoned me, and with such a delicious treat too. What do you want from me?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I need subordinates. I want you to serve me loyally.\" I spoke up.</p><p><br></p><p>Hesitating was a mistake in front of Daemons.</p><p><br></p><p>You need to be the dominant and confident one in front of them.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Oh my. That's quite a wish. Unfortunately the price is not enough. Also… I don't serve weaklings.\" She smiled lightly.</p><p><br></p><p>\"That so?\" I raised my eyebrow. I wasn't expecting things to go so easily. Finally, I let go of my Presence Suppression and my power raged in the surroundings.</p><p><br></p><p>Dragon's Haki.</p><p><br></p><p>A new Skill available to Dragons and Dragonoids. The entire area started trembling under my power and the Daemoness looked at me, bewildered at the sudden change.</p><p><br></p><p>\"How about now?\" I asked. \"And as for the price, how about I give you a name?\"</p><p><br></p><p>Her eyes widened at the last bit of information. She kneeled. \"Then I am yours to command.\" </p><p><br></p><p>I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>The question now was, what to name her.</p><p><br></p><p>Noble look. White hair. Red eyes. Ah, I know.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Your name will be Irisviel.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Umu. Prefect name.</p><p><br></p><p>This time however I felt a large part, almost one third of my power drain from me. This was surprising because I had enormous Magicule Reserves surpassing normal Awakened Demon Lords.</p><p><br></p><p>Her level increased, surpassing all my subordinates by miles. </p><p><br></p><p>This should be enough to fight against even the two people who were guarding Masayuki a while ago.</p><p><br></p><p>Saints.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, it was far from my new power level.</p><p><br></p><p>Her transformation competed and she looked at me in awe and reverence</p><p><br></p><p>“What are your orders, my Lord?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am trying to make a faction of my own but I don’t have enough and able subordinates. I need more people. They will be rewarded with a name if they decide to join me. I want you to find them.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Is there any limit to how many you want, my Lord?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. I will name everyone. You don’t have to worry about it.” I replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“In that case, I will get to work.”</p><p><br></p><p>Some more instructions were given to her and I left the place.</p><p><br></p><p>She will take care of the recruitment for me.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Damrada -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure?” he asked Berine to make sure of the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, sir.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Now, that’s interesting?”</p><p><br></p><p>The news was indeed surprising as the rise of a Saint was rare. Even more so on this side of the continent than on the other side.</p><p><br></p><p>A new Saint.</p><p><br></p><p>Another student of the Conqueror of Flames.</p><p><br></p><p>First, Hinata Sakaguchi, the hero.</p><p><br></p><p>Then Yuuki Kagurazaka, the cunning young man whom he was growing to be acquainted with and now…</p><p><br></p><p>Salvatore, the Saint.</p><p><br></p><p>And this one was a genius too. Even more so than the previous ones. </p><p><br></p><p>He was apparently contracted to a Darkness Spirit too so maybe he was also a Hero Candidate, possessing a Hero Egg.</p><p><br></p><p>Really, just what kind of luck did she have to be a key figure in the lives of so many up and coming figures? Even the new upcoming Monster Rimuru Tempest seemed to be connected to her.</p><p><br></p><p>He had heard of Salvatore being an Enlightened but a Saint was a completely different thing, especially if he was going towards the Jura Forest to free slaves.</p><p><br></p><p>With the plans they had in store for Jura Forest, it could be… problematic.</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, if he was used properly, maybe things wouldn’t be all that bad.</p><p><br></p><p>He had been the Prime Minister of the Eastern Empire for a long time. Moves like these were everyday work for him.</p><p><br></p><p>If the work is done then it would be fine, if not… well, having a friendship or recruiting another Saint for the double numbers could be good too.</p><p><br></p><p>Especially one who could make both Bernie and Jiu feel as if staring into the eyes of death itself.</p><p><br></p><p>After all, there was only so much a single man could do.</p><p><br></p><p>He was not Guy Crimson, Emperor Rudra, nor was he a True Dragon or Princess Milim.</p><p><br></p><p>Salvatore after all was just a mere Saint. Hardly a threat compared to those monsters</p><p><br></p><p>With this in mind, he passed on a message to the group heading towards Jura Forest, the same message he had sent Hinata Sakaguchi.</p><p><br></p><p>The message of Rimuru Tempest killing Shizue Izawa.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe, little Hinata can get some assistance from a junior to take down the big bad Slime.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Salvatore -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I narrowed my eyes as the guy who informed me of a <em>secret</em> left.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru Tempest killed Shizue Izawa.</p><p><br></p><p>Information from a <em>well wisher</em>.</p><p><br></p><p>My journey had taken me around two weeks and now I was reaching the borders of the Jura Forest.</p><p><br></p><p>And suddenly, I get this information. What a coincidence?</p><p><br></p><p>Two days ago, I had returned back to the Dwelling of the Spirits and found my students at Ramiris’ place.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru had left them at Ramiris’ place upon getting the message I left there. We missed each other again by a short margin of time.</p><p><br></p><p>My students were all excited upon making contracts with spirits.</p><p><br></p><p>I also noticed that despite my warning, Ramiris used her automaton and it was destroyed and replaced by a new servant called Beretta.</p><p><br></p><p>It attacked me when I entered the place and was almost erased accidentally by me but thankfully Ramiris came quickly and stopped everything.</p><p><br></p><p>I convinced/bribed Ramiris with candies to keep them there for some time until I returned from Tempest.</p><p><br></p><p>The children agreed with some convincing/bribing too.</p><p><br></p><p>On a side note, Chloe was using Shizue’s mask now.</p><p><br></p><p>So now, I was leading the former slaves back to Jura.</p><p><br></p><p>“My Lord, this is our homeland.” Olga said as we entered the forest.</p><p><br></p><p>Shanks and his two lackeys also had nostalgic looks on their faces.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have heard of a city of monsters in the Jura Forest ruled by someone who defeated the Orc Lord. We will go there first and then you all can go wherever you want.” I announced.</p><p><br></p><p>No one had a problem so we continued, until…</p><p><br></p><p>My Universe Sense picked up something. An area without Magic in front of us.</p><p><br></p><p>Anti Magic area?</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly I remembered that there was something about Hinata attacking Rimuru on the way back. I thought that with my intervention and Rimuru getting back from a different route, things would change but now it seems that some other forces were at play. Someone was pitting us against each other.</p><p><br></p><p>Was it Yuuki Kagurazaka?</p><p><br></p><p>“Shanks. There is a battle going on in this area. I will take a look. You all take a different route scouted by Jibril and protect the people. Lead them to Tempest City.” I commanded as I raced forward.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, my Lord.”</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>A distance away from me I saw a dome erected which was casting an Anti-Magic Area over the vicinity. Inside it, two figures clashed….or rather, one ran from the other while defending.</p><p><br></p><p>One was a black haired japanese girl, dressed in white templar uniform and wielding a sword which was giving off a dangerous vibe.</p><p><br></p><p>The other one was a light blue haired girl? who looked a lot like Shizue and was currently wielding a katana which was knocked over.</p><p><br></p><p>I unsheathed one of my spare swords and threw it directly in between the two, my Uriel at the same time flared up, destroying the Anti-Magic area and at the same time, dragging the ones who were casting the Spell down in my Shadow Prison.</p><p><br></p><p>Both the fighters stopped and looked at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Who are you? Why are you interfering in our fight?” The girl in white asked, while looking wary.</p><p><br></p><p>The other one didn’t say anything but she looked at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“I believe I am involved in this fight too.”</p><p><br></p><p>My reply surprised both the people as they looked at me, one with narrowed eyes, the other with curiosity. I continued. “You both are Hinata Sakaguchi and Rimuru Tempest, correct?”</p><p><br></p><p>The bitchier one narrowed her eyes but didn’t answer while the other one nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“My name is Salvatore. I am the last student of Shizue Izawa.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now, this surprised both of the fighters.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, Shizue-san told me about you. Sal, one of her best students. You were teaching the students of the Freedom Academy, right. I missed you both times. Thanks for the note though. Without it, I would have been stuck for who knows how long trying to find the Dwelling of Spirits.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you for taking my students in my place. I… failed them as a teacher.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No no. You did more than I can even imagine. Chloe told me how you carried her on your back and ran through an entire country and even fought Clayman’s army and Charybdis to get her to safety. I doubt any teacher would ever do so for a student. You did your best, Salvatore.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you. It really heals my mind and heart to hear those words. But shall we come to the topic at hand. Why are you two fighting?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you even need to ask that? This monster here killed Shizue-sensei. Why are you talking to him in such a friendly manner?” The black haired girl shouted.</p><p><br></p><p>“I most certainly didn’t.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Stop lying, monster.</p><p><br></p><p>The two started shouting at each other once more.</p><p><br></p><p>“Be quiet!”</p><p><br></p><p>I raised my voice, stopping the two of them by my sudden outburst.</p><p><br></p><p>“Almost an hour or so ago, I received a message from a so-called well wisher that Rimuru Tempest killed Shizue Izawa and devoured her body. It was quite suspicious that immediately afterwards I would find the two of you fighting so conveniently in front of me. Rimuru has given me no reason to doubt till now. So, let me try to clear this with words first. I have a Skill which can recognize lies. So, let me ask a few questions. If you are innocent. I will not let anyone harm you.” I said this while eying Hinata and then continued.”But if you <em>are</em> guilty. <em>I’d make you wish your soul were erased by that sword</em>. Are we clear with this?”</p><p><br></p><p>They didn’t say a word and I continued.</p><p><br></p><p>Activating Milim’s Eye, I questioned.</p><p><br></p><p>“First of all, did you kill Shizue Izawa?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Lies.” Hinata shouted. “You wear her face and dare lie to me”</p><p><br></p><p>“Actually,” I looked at Hinata with slight pity. “Sensei was at the end of her life already. I travelled with her for almost a year or so and I noticed that she was losing control of her powers. She didn’t like Ifirt as you might already know and she was nearing her end. She knew that it would be the last time we would ever meet and hence I said that I was her last student. Even when I begged her, she denied fusing with Ifrit to become a Majin to extend her life. At the end of it all, I respected her wishes and left.”</p><p><br></p><p>Hinata was digesting the news while I questioned Rimuru once more.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why do you have Shizue-sensei’s face? Please explain in detail.”</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru nodded and replied. “It was her last wish. She didn’t want her body to remain in this world that she had grown to hate after her death so she asked me to devour her body. I absorbed her body in mine and due to my Extra Skill: Mimic, I can now change to look a bit similar to her.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No lies.” </p><p><br></p><p>To be honest, I wasn’t sure if the so called <em>canon</em> in my mind was even a thing. For all I knew, some other reincarnator had hijacked Rimuru’s body and had really killed Shizue. This was as much for my sake as it was for Hinata’s.</p><p><br></p><p>I turned towards Hinata. “He was not lying.” Then turning towards Rimuru, I continued. “Thank you for answering my questions. I was going to visit Tempest too but I sensed this so I stopped. There might be more attackers, so you should check on your city.” I spoke finally.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru nodded quickly before trying to run only for Hinata to fire a holy arrow spell in his direction.</p><p><br></p><p>I narrowed my eyes. “What is the meaning of this Sakaguchi?”</p><p><br></p><p>She picked up her sword. “You think you can just walk up here and spout anything and I would believe you? You could be his accomplice for all I know. I have no reason to trust you.” She pointed her sword at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sal.” Rimuru called out from behind me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry about me.” I unsheathed my sword too, facing Hinata squarely. “I will be fine. You have your people to save, be quick.”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded and then a huge wolf which I had been sensing in his shadow sprang up suddenly. “Thank you. Oh and by the way….I am a girl.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>What!</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t have much time to think as Hinata was about to charge. I clashed with her and pushed her back quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>“What you say is reasonable. After all, we haven’t met before. For all you know, I could be his accomplice and be trickling you. You have no reason to believe me.So….” I raised my sword in front of me and pushed my Magicules in it. Holy Flames lit up the bones. “So, let me ask you this” My Magicules were released without any restraint and she defended herself from the resulting whirlwind which uprooted the nearby trees. “What reason does a Dragon have….<em>to lie to an ant</em>?”</p><p>____________________________x_________________________________________________________x_____________________________</p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: LuluViBritania(FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Authors Note:</strong></p><p><strong>Finally done.</strong></p><p><strong>We are seeing the effects of the butterflies.</strong></p><p><strong>I needed to add some original characters(Shanks and Irisviel are canon but are called Hiro and Testarossa there) or it would have been plain stealing from Rimuru all the time.</strong></p><p><strong>We needed some new blood and as Rimuru says….ELVESSSSS.

Just like the cliché school for adventurers in an isekai manga.</p><p><br></p><p>I reached this place two weeks after I had separated from Shizue.</p><p><br></p><p>There was even a Guild attached to the place. The guild was run by Yuuki Kagurazaka, from what I remembered, one of the villains of the series.</p><p><br></p><p>My memories of his abilities are a bit hazy. It has been over two decades.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy looked like a typical lanky japanese youth but there was something in his well mannered amiable words that put me at edge against him.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t know but I was feeling danger from the guy, so I tried to stay away from him as much as possible. I did however try and spar against him.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a simple spar and despite what I might have felt about the guy, he was a skilled fighter. </p><p><br></p><p>I lost a few matches but gained far more than him in those matches.</p><p><br></p><p>I gained a few Skills and finally understood how this guy could become one of the strongest villains in a world full of broken people like Rimuru Tempest and Guy Crimson.</p><p><br></p><p>Unique Skill: Creator.</p><p><br></p><p>It had three basic functions.</p><p><br></p><p>Skill Creation: It can use the user’s soul energy to make Skills they desire. The desire has to border on desperation though.</p><p><br></p><p>This alone was a Skill which made people shout hax.</p><p><br></p><p>Although there were <em>severe</em> restrictions for the Skill.</p><p><br></p><p>The stronger the Skill created, the more the energy required. It couldn’t create anything the user wanted without limit. Creating Unique Skills was nigh impossible. </p><p><br></p><p>Soul Energy cannot be restored easily and the energy is lost permanently every time the Skill is used. It was quite similar to naming monsters. So the user couldn’t go on spamming the Skill. This was even more so for humans who didn't have enough magicules.</p><p><br></p><p>The User has to know how the Skill works.</p><p><br></p><p>This part however was partially taken care of by the second sub-Skill, Analysis.</p><p><br></p><p>This Skill allows the user to Analyse anything the touch and any Skill that they see directly.</p><p><br></p><p>This reduces the first sub-skill’s restrictions by a lot.</p><p><br></p><p>The real danger was the third sub-skill.</p><p><br></p><p>Anti-Skill. It is basically a body composition that invalidates all forces, skills, abilities or magic the user touches. It however cannot counteract two or more properties when it comes to magic and arts fusion.</p><p><br></p><p>And this was the only reason I was even alive.</p><p><br></p><p>My Negation Zone came not only from my own Skill but also from my Sacred Gear. This prevents him from analysing my Skills and protects me.</p><p><br></p><p>He tried to figure it out but wasn’t able to because I never let him use his skill on me and pretended like the Skill just came naturally to me so I didn’t know how it worked.</p><p><br></p><p>After a week of futile effort he did give up but not before doing something.</p><p><br></p><p>He started showing a kind facade in front of me. Like a helpful senior helping a junior. It took me a few days to realise that he had planted a parasite in me.</p><p><br></p><p>I could remove the parasite immediately but that would get his attention so all I did was used some of my energy and isolated the parasite, making it harmless while still keeping his contact so that he doesn’t figure out that I removed it.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, he is without a doubt, a genius.</p><p><br></p><p>A once in a century kind of genius.</p><p><br></p><p>I couldn’t defeat the current him even if we were on the same level of power.</p><p><br></p><p>And this was a big wake up call for me.</p><p><br></p><p>I went ahead and stayed in the Academy, teaching the children about normal things, arts and magic.</p><p><br></p><p>All the time, waiting for Rimuru so that I can leave with him for Ramiris’ place.</p><p><br></p><p>I did hear about the rumours of a monster nation.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t sit still either.</p><p><br></p><p>I did gain Yuuki’s abilities though. Thought Acceleration was a massive boon. There was another Skill called Thought Direction. It basically worked as a Forced Focus.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn't test them in this place where I didn't know who was watching me.</p><p><br></p><p>These little gremlins were not ready to accept any teachers at all and only accepted me when they learned that I was also a student of Shizue.</p><p><br></p><p>And I have to say that they have grown on me.</p><p><br></p><p>Kenya is a hothead who idolised Shizue and wanted to use Fire Style swordsmanship.</p><p><br></p><p>Ryota is usually timid and follows him in whatever he does.</p><p><br></p><p>Gale is quite calm and quiet most of the time.</p><p><br></p><p>Alice is a tsundere princess.</p><p><br></p><p>And Chloe O’ Bell is the most calm and collected of all as well as a prodigy.</p><p><br></p><p>It took me some time but I got them all to trust me and now they consider me as their teacher.</p><p><br></p><p>The experience of dealing with children in the church’s orphanage came in handy.</p><p><br></p><p>“Teacher. I learned how to do Magic Coating on swords.” I looked at the source of the voice and found a cute girl with black hair and black, ten years old looking at me eagerly for praise. A smile found its way to my lips as I remembered the figure of my cute brother overlapping with the girl’s. He used to be excited as well and showed me when he learned anything new or did his chores, trying to fish for praise.</p><p><br></p><p>I patted the cute girl’s head. “Congratulations. I knew you could do it. You even completed it before everyone else.  So, what do you want for the reward, Chloe?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Candied fruits.” The girl replied while enjoying me caressing her head.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Okay. I will make some for you.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Isaiah was always a quiet child and among all my students here, Chloe is the quietest one.</p><p><br></p><p>I got up and went into the kitchen. These children were basically kidnaped from their homes. And were now thrust into a near death situation with no visible ends.</p><p><br></p><p>In my time here, I have also researched the way to find Ramiris' place. I needed to prepare for the case where Rimuru didn't appear.</p><p><br></p><p>I had already joined the Free Guild as an adventurer previously when travelling with Shizue and even went on some missions with her. It was basically her teaching me.</p><p><br></p><p>Now however, I was soloing it so as to not expose my Skills to anyone.</p><p><br></p><p>The job of an adventurer helped me get some information and do some work which wouldn’t have been possible normally sitting as a teacher.</p><p><br></p><p>From the map given to me by Shizue, I was able to locate the approximate location of the cave. But the problem was that that particular location was already closed. There were apparently several locations for reaching the Dwelling of Spirits but many of them have been destroyed over the years.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t let that stop me and got some clues to another entrance.</p><p><br></p><p>The labyrinth where the Spirits lived was created by Ramiris’ Intrinsic Skill, The Small World and its opening lies in the Ulg National Park in the northern part of a frontier region called Ulgrasia.</p><p><br></p><p>We ate our breakfast and left for our class together.</p><p><br></p><p>I was really enjoying these peaceful days.</p><p><br></p><p>But unfortunately all good things end after sometime.</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>I. was awakened from my sleep by the shouts of Kenya who was banging on my door.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sensei, Sensei, come out fast! There is trouble!”</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly got out of bed and ran out to see what was going on.</p><p><br></p><p>Outside, Kenya looked shaken and was sweating. This was probably not a prank. “Sensei, Chloe… Chloe she…”</p><p><br></p><p>“What happened to Chloe?” I asked him as I picked him up and raced to the student dorms.</p><p><br></p><p>“She’s in pain. Shouting. Power everywhere.”</p><p><br></p><p>What!</p><p><br></p><p>“Explain.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t know. Alice said Chloe was making painful noises in her sleep as if having a bad dream but started to flail around and shout in pain as if she was being attacked and now there is power everywhere.”</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t need him to tell me about it.Her power was radiating outside and I would be a complete amateur not to see or feel the surge.</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly reached the place and there were some teachers already present there.</p><p><br></p><p>“Salvatore. It’s…”</p><p><br></p><p>“What’s happening?”</p><p><br></p><p>One of the teachers shook his head. “She is at her end. Her magicules have grown beyond her young body’s control these last few months.It’s tearing her apart. I saw this phenomenon once before in another child summoned before. As hard as it might be to think, I think you should end her life or the explosion could ruin half the city.”</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>End her life?</p><p><br></p><p>I stared incredulously at the man.</p><p><br></p><p>He was asking me to kill her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why? Her magicules were not that strong. How did it suddenly increase so much?” I asked, completely ignoring the previous statement. Snapping at anyone will not change anything.</p><p><br></p><p>“Elisha has checked and it seems that something draconic has caused her and the rest of the children’s powers to rise. Dragons are the strongest of monsters and the magicules released by them can cause different effects in different people. Stronger ones even make strong and dense miasma around them which give birth to monsters. I don’t know how they could get something like that.” He shook his head.</p><p><br></p><p>My heart was sinking with each of his words.</p><p><br></p><p>Draconic.</p><p><br></p><p>The only Draconic thing around the students these past few months… was me.</p><p><br></p><p>I pushed past the teachers and reached the bed where Chloe’s powers were running out of control and some of the teachers were maintaining a barrier around her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sensei… will she be… will Chlo-chi be alright?” Alice caught my sleeve and asked me in fear.</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing something like this must be hard for her. Especially when something extremely similar can happen to her at a later date.</p><p><br></p><p>“She… will be alright. I won’t let anything happen to her… or any one of you. I promise.” I clenched my fingers and patted her head.</p><p><br></p><p>The rampaging energy might have been too much for the teachers who were still normal humans but for an Enlightened like me, it was quite easy.</p><p><br></p><p>I walked forward.</p><p><br></p><p>“Salvatore… be careful, she’s dangerous.” Someone tried to stop me but I released my magical power and he stepped back.</p><p><br></p><p>No one in the school knew about me being an Enlightened except Yuuki. I had asked for it to be that way so as to not be bothered by the Guild for random tasks.</p><p><br></p><p>The other teachers moved back in shock.</p><p><br></p><p>I even heard the exclamations of Enlightened and Sage around me but paid them no heed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Negation Zone.”</p><p><br></p><p>A small field spread around me and tore through the barriers and covered Chloe. Her rampaging Magicules were calmed in an instant.</p><p><br></p><p>Negation Zone was far stronger than the Delete Field and could dispel the magicules in an area to stop any kind of magic or Skills.</p><p><br></p><p>This was a temporary cure however.</p><p><br></p><p>“Carter.” I called the first teacher who talked to me and he soon recovered from his shock and came to me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will be taking her to get her cured. I will return for the other students when I am done with Chloe. See to it that my students remain safe till then. Can I trust you with them?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I… I will do that.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sensei…” Alice and the rest of the students looked at me and it looked like they thought I was abandoning them.</p><p><br></p><p>Memories of Shizue must be flashing through their minds now.</p><p><br></p><p>“I need to go alone with Chloe to reach a place fast enough. If we all go together, we might delay the treatment. I promise that I will come back after curing her. Do you trust me?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>They nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay.”</p><p><br></p><p>I picked Chloe up and carried her with me.</p><p><br></p><p>Carter followed me with the rest of the teachers and a few of them stayed and took care of the children.</p><p><br></p><p>“Salvatore, you are a Sage! Why didn’t you tell us?”</p><p><br></p><p>“We can talk about that later, Carter. First I need your help.” I brought out a bag of gold coins and handed it over to him. “Get me enough supplies for a month-long journey including water. Be as fast as you can. We are racing against time.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What can you even do, Sal? I have never heard of anyone surviving this.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You haven’t but I have.” I quickly replied. “Shizue Izawa was summoned at the age of five and still lived. She was out to find how it happened. I think I might know and I want to try.”</p><p><br></p><p>He stopped and then nodded after a few moments.</p><p><br></p><p>I started preparing for my equipment too.</p><p><br></p><p>The guild was close to the school and things were prepared in a few hours.</p><p><br></p><p>I picked up Chloe and tied her on my back with a belt.</p><p><br></p><p>She needed to be within the range of my Negation Zone to keep her magic from rampaging but I couldn’t keep my Negation Zone active at full power for a month or so long, not to mention if I encountered dangers on the way. The main reason why I was waiting for Rimuru’s arrival.</p><p><br></p><p>Before leaving, I gave a piece of paper to the students with the location of the Dwelling of Spirits with instructions to give it to a teacher with Shizue’s mask if I am not back after 2 months.</p><p><br></p><p>And thus started one more journey.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Kagali -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She looked at the young man leaving the Freedom Academy with a child strapped on his back. The commotion was large enough for her to notice.</p><p><br></p><p>Yuuki was not present in the country, he was out due to some work.</p><p><br></p><p>Sensing the appearance of one of her Harlequins, she looked back to find Tear.</p><p><br></p><p>“Charybdis was slain by Demon Lord Milim Nava. The core was retrieved.” She handed over the core of the monster to her.</p><p><br></p><p>She however handed back the Core to her. “Take this and follow that man. Take some of Clayman’s people with you and stop him. If he surrenders, take him in and make him a Majin. If he doesn’t surrender, let the people of Clayman put him in a near death state and <em>save</em> him afterwards. He is extremely talented and can probably rival Laplace once he becomes a Majin. So make sure you get him. Use the core if you have to. Don’t interfere directly.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes my Lady.”</p><p><br></p><p>The failure of the Orc Lord was already a setback. This was not something she would let go.</p><p><br></p><p>A Skill which even Yuuki cannot bypass was just too good to let go.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Salvatore -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I spread the map in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>The area I was going to have to pass through was a dangerous one.</p><p><br></p><p>Ulgrasia was a kingdom bordering the Jura Forest. The entry to the cave was on the southern end of the country, near the country’s coast.</p><p><br></p><p>The normal path would have required me taking a roundabout route through several other countries and finally reaching the place by following the coast.</p><p><br></p><p>Now though, I couldn’t do that. I needed to cut through the country directly which included the parts of a Demon Lord’s territory.</p><p><br></p><p>Demon Lord Clayman.</p><p><br></p><p>This was however the shortest path I could find, taking around a week to reach there.</p><p><br></p><p>I had no idea how strong a Demon Lord Seed like him could be so I needed to be stealthy.</p><p><br></p><p>Technically an Enlightened can be as strong as a Demon Lord Seed but the power levels of even Demon Lord Seeds are highly varied. From someone weak to someone strong, the difference can be more than ten times in just the Magicules capacity. Beyond that, there is also the Arts, Skills, Magic, and equipment.</p><p><br></p><p>I could fight them if I was by myself or at least have a chance to escape but with my Negation Zone continuously being used to keep Chloe in check, my moves were severely restricted.</p><p><br></p><p>Even with my Dragon’s core providing me with another Magicule source, I would still be pushing it if I were to engage in such a fight.</p><p><br></p><p>Chloe had regained consciousness for a while and I told her everything. She went back to sleep to calm her mind while I carried her. We did it to prevent any intense emotions in her.</p><p><br></p><p>It was on the fourth day of my journey that I encountered someone.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- ??? -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He walked around aimlessly feeling desolated after the death of his entire Clan.</p><p><br></p><p>The once prosperous tribe of ogres was now nothing more than a heap of dirt.</p><p><br></p><p>All that remained now was the graves in their destroyed village.</p><p><br></p><p>He was left with their memories and the guilt of not being able to assist his family in their last time.</p><p><br></p><p>The armies of Demon Lord Clayman would be searching for him for his betrayal in leaving his post to go out to assist his family. Last time he had barely escaped death but now…</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe it was for the best.</p><p><br></p><p>Somehow, just maybe, if he died, he might reunite with his companions.</p><p><br></p><p>As he was thinking of this, he heard a sound and felt someone racing towards him at a very high speed. He put a hand on his sword and got up to defend himself only to be taken aback at the scene in front of him.</p><p><br></p><p>A human boy was carrying a child on his back. In these parts of the forests…</p><p><br></p><p>He seemed equally stunned at the presence of another living being…</p><p><br></p><p><strong>– Salvatore –</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I put a hand on my sword's handle as I looked at the Ogre in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>Red hair and a katana like sword.</p><p><br></p><p>Was he Benimaru?</p><p><br></p><p>\"Who are you, human? What are you doing in these forests?\" He asked, his hands still on his sword's handle, muscles tensed for an attack.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I just need to pass. I do not intend to fight. My student needs help as soon as possible. Please let me pass quietly.\"</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at me and then at Chloe, his eyes widening slightly at the girl's condition. \"She's…\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Just let me pass here without fighting, please.\"</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at me once more before letting down his guard and backing away.</p><p><br></p><p>Still keeping him in my sight, I moved towards the side, to leave the area but was faced by an energy wave and out of the way.</p><p><br></p><p>The wave however came from a different place and not from the Ogre.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well well, would you look at that? A traitor and a rat have entered the territory. Now, what should I do with you?”</p><p><br></p><p>A man with half black and half white hair and a black claw-like armour appeared.from behind the forest covers. He carried a sword on his back which was giving off a chilling atmosphere.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yamza.” The Ogre called as he drew out his sword.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t want to get involved in the fight so I tried to negotiate. “I don’t wish to fight. I only want to pass through here. I will not interfere in your fights… just let me go.”</p><p><br></p><p>All that got me in return was a slash of sword from the new guy which I jumped to the side to dodge.</p><p><br></p><p>“Heh. Do you think a little bug like you has the power to negotiate with me? I am Yamza, one of the Five Fingers… Eh?”</p><p><br></p><p>His words didn’t continue as his sword arm flew in the air. The barriers around him and his armour did nothing as my sword simply sliced through the man from shoulder to the torso, barely missing his neck.</p><p><br></p><p>He fell to the ground the next instant with a shocked look still on his face.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked back at the Ogre who was stunned in place. “I will repeat again. I DO NOT WISH TO FIGHT. But if you push me, I will not hold back either.”</p><p><br></p><p>He raised his hand and backed down as I raced out of the area.</p><p><br></p><p>The journey however became troublesome.</p><p><br></p><p>Entire branches of Clayman’s army were stationed in the area and had noticed the death of one of them.</p><p><br></p><p>I for once brought out my Lævateinn as holy flames lit my sword ablaze and charged straight into them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Shadow Prison.” I used my Skill on a large area as tendrils of shadows appeared from below and dragged the monsters to a shadow dimension. They resisted but I didn’t intend to capture them. Each of their heads flew instantly as they were entangled by the Shadow Prison.</p><p><br></p><p>I cut a way straight through the horde.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Mjurran -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She felt a severe chill in her spine as she looked at the sight. She had been tricked into Clayman’s service for centuries now and this was probably the first time she had encountered something like this. Looking at the man fighting in front of her, it was hard to say who the real monster was.</p><p><br></p><p>Monsters were dying as if being thrown in fire.</p><p><br></p><p>Shadow Tendrils rose and grabbed any monster on the ground and the very next instant, they would lose their heads. Even if by some chance, they managed to save their heads, they would be burned by the intense holy flames of the sword. It must be at least a Legend Ranked one but somehow Mjurran doubted even that.</p><p><br></p><p>She hid and then slowly went to the place where Yamza’s body lay.</p><p><br></p><p>The Ogre had taken away the Unique Sword of Yamza but she didn’t have enough time or even power to worry about it.</p><p><br></p><p>She had to use the emergency measure in this case. She brought out the half destroyed core of Charybdis and used her magic to fuse Yamza’s body with the core. The Spirit hadn’t passed away completely and the magicules from the surrounding demons dying was collected under the action of the spells.</p><p><br></p><p>The Dragon Core pulsed as the energy gathered.</p><p><br></p><p>Mjurran raced away from the place knowing what was going to happen and just as she had predicted, as soon as she reached out of the range, a loud roar echoed around the area.</p><p><br></p><p>Charybdis was back.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Salvatore -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I felt a massive chill in my spine as I heard the roar of what sounded like a dragon.</p><p><br></p><p>In the last one and half years, I have slayed a few dragons. None of them were strong per say.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, I did observe that my Sacred Gear seemed to devour the core of the dragons. It strengthened my magicules by a certain amount. Nothing like an evolution but still a decent amount. Although, now that I think about it, it might have been the reason for the Dragon’s Aura increasing and affecting my students.</p><p><br></p><p>A Dragon’s call was almost like a challenge to me. Maybe because of my Sacred Gear which contained a soul of a Dragon perhaps, or at least a part of the soul.</p><p><br></p><p>I had tried several times to communicate with the soul but returned empty handed because the soul seemed incomplete somehow.</p><p><br></p><p>It didn’t stop it from being competitive towards other dragons however. This time though, just the roar of the being in the area sent chills down my spine.</p><p><br></p><p>This was not any ordinary dragon. It was beyond anything I had faced and I did face a fucking Sky Dagon alone.</p><p><br></p><p>I turned back and saw the figure rising from behind the trees.</p><p><br></p><p>It was huge. Beyond anything I had seen yet.</p><p><br></p><p>The monsters in the area looked at it with just the same amount of terror and started fleeing.</p><p><br></p><p>I clutched onto the belts holding Chloe on my back and kicked the ground, racing outside the area.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly, I dodged to the side as an arrow passed by the place I was going to be in.</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>These bastards were still going to attack me.</p><p><br></p><p>The huge dragon seemed to have taken notice and roared into the air once more. Its scales rose and shot towards me as if a rain of deadly bullets.</p><p><br></p><p>I clutched my Lævateinn and channelled my magicules into it but before I could attack, a wave of flames covered the scales, knocking them out of the way.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the origin of the attack and saw the same Ogre looking towards me.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked a bit hesitant but nodded towards me and I returned the nod barely hesitating for a few moments. I think the other guy called him a traitor and by that line, we were both on the same boat. Moreover, he just used the Ogre Flame, a very rare art only the best among ogres could use.</p><p><br></p><p>I was again reminded about my rare scattered memories of this world and the name Benimaru came up.</p><p><br></p><p>Was he really…?</p><p><br></p><p>“Why?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“You saved my life. I was going to die either way. This way I would die by helping you save someone. Maybe, my fallen family will forgive me when I reach them.”</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>Was he talking about the ogres?</p><p><br></p><p>My thoughts were interrupted again.</p><p><br></p><p>He spoke first, “Charybdis. The dragon of the Jura forest. I have heard hundreds of legends about the beast of Calamity. It was born from the magicules of the Storm Dragon Veldora and is extremely strong. This looks as if it was created with sorcery and is not natural. ” He said quickly as he took down the monsters in the surrounding areas.</p><p><br></p><p>Charybdis!</p><p><br></p><p>I knew of this name.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a story that Shizue told me about.</p><p><br></p><p>This thing was comparable to a stronger Demon Lord Seed in terms of sheer magicules. Althout, it was not exactly smart and that reduced its level. The said level was still at a mind-numbing Special A Rank.</p><p><br></p><p>I used my Magic Sense but due to the insane amount of Magicules in the atmosphere, I couldn’t sense anything.</p><p><br></p><p>Thousands of random thoughts raced through my head as I thought about the current situation.</p><p><br></p><p>If this was created by sorcery, we were being targeted.</p><p><br></p><p>Running and thinking it would leave us alone was a fool’s dream.</p><p><br></p><p>The only way to leave seemed to be through killing it myself.</p><p><br></p><p>If my time alone in the wild had taught me something, it was decisiveness.</p><p><br></p><p>Shizue had hammered the lesson into my head.</p><p><br></p><p>Even strong beings got killed if they hesitated in battle.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked towards the Ogre who had defended us with another round of Ogre Flames and stepped back.</p><p><br></p><p>“If you wish to repay me, just do me one favour.”</p><p><br></p><p>He spared me another glance before replying, “Speak.”</p><p><br></p><p>“If I die today, take her to the ‘Dwelling of Spirits’ and ask Ramiris to get her a contract with a Spirit. That’s the only way to save her life.”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at me a bit stunned but then the look in his eyes hardened. “I give you my oath.”</p><p><br></p><p>We quickly took cover to hide for a while.</p><p><br></p><p>I slowly lowered Chloe who was still sleeping under the effect of my spell and he approached me.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will not be able to fight at full power with others around me. Hide and protect her.” I gave him the map.</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded. “On the honour of the Ogres, I vow to protect her with my life.”</p><p><br></p><p>I placed a kiss on Chloe’s forehead and caressed her head again, not knowing what would happen next.</p><p><br></p><p>I was going to try my Balance Breaker to stop this dragon and give them a chance to run. In all this time, I couldn’t think of any other way.</p><p><br></p><p>This dragon was just too strong for me to hold back.</p><p><br></p><p>At this point, even trusting a complete stranger seemed a more appropriate choice than trying to flee alone.</p><p><br></p><p>“She is suffering from excess magicules and won’t be able to survive away from me. Be careful.”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded and then ran.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked back at the gigantic figure in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>“Balance Breaker.”</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Milim Nava -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She was flying above the forests to meet Ramiris so that she could brag to her about her new bestie.</p><p><br></p><p>She was going to show off her new dragon gloves and her sailor costume and even tell her about the honey…</p><p><br></p><p>BOOMMMMMMMMM!</p><p><br></p><p>The blast attracted her attention and she looked in the distance to find a very astonishing scene.</p><p><br></p><p>Wasn’t that Charybdis which she had blasted a few days ago? Rimuru even devoured it.</p><p><br></p><p>So how is it here?</p><p><br></p><p>On looking closer, she found that it was not the same as the original and had used the magicules of the other monsters to take form.</p><p><br></p><p>The real surprise however was the one fighting against it.</p><p><br></p><p>She almost doubted her eye when she saw it for the first time so she used her special skill Milim Eye to look closer.</p><p><br></p><p>A Dragon-Human Hybrid.</p><p><br></p><p>Even their souls looked similar to her own. A mix between a dragon and a human.</p><p><br></p><p>Was there another dragonoid in the world?</p><p><br></p><p>He waved his hand and countless tendrils or shadows wrapped around Charybdis. In retaliation, it let out a shower of his own scales.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy rushed forward, stepping on the scales itself and racing towards Charybdis. Flames on his sword raged even more as he jumped and slashed down with a shout.</p><p><br></p><p>A giant wave of holy flames attacked Charybdis, blasting off half of its right wing. It shrieked in agony.</p><p><br></p><p>Milim found herself taking out her popcorn basket and watching the show.</p><p><br></p><p>Charybdis started healing itself from the magicules of the monsters which were being transferred to it.</p><p><br></p><p>On looking closer, Milim found that there was a Majin who was hiding and controlling it. She flashed there instantly, picking up the Majin by her scruff.</p><p><br></p><p>“What are you doing? Are you trying to kill the boy? Don’t do it. He is interesting.”</p><p><br></p><p>The Majin looked scared beyond anything.</p><p><br></p><p>Eh, she’s weak.</p><p><br></p><p>Thinking this, Milim dropped her to the ground as Charybdis stopped healing.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tell me, did you send Charybdis to attack Rimuru?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I… I…”</p><p><br></p><p>Milim used her awesome Milim eye again and saw that she had a seal on her heart.</p><p><br></p><p>Ah, one of Clayman’s puppets.</p><p><br></p><p>“No need to answer.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Wha…”</p><p><br></p><p>Then she punched the Majin unconscious. </p><p><br></p><p>Now she can enjoy her show. The fighting became even more intense and she noticed that the boy's form looked a bit similar to her own Assault Mode.</p><p><br></p><p>He was expending too much energy to keep it up.</p><p><br></p><p>Charybdis started to charge an attack but the boy raised an arm and the attack was shattered.</p><p><br></p><p>Milim observed a thin dome around them. A Skill?</p><p><br></p><p>The boy was keeping up with Charybdis, negating all its Skills while severely weakening the ones he couldn’t negate.</p><p><br></p><p>His sword was leaving deep scars on the beast with each slash.</p><p><br></p><p>A few hours later, Milim noticed that the boy was going out of control, going into an outrage-like state.</p><p><br></p><p>His power got stronger but he was fighting on instinct.</p><p><br></p><p>He stabbed his blade into Charybdis’ eyes and slashed through its whole body, finally tearing it into two. He then grabbed the core and shadows covered the two while the boy’s aura started getting stronger at an alarming rate.</p><p><br></p><p>Ah, he went out of control.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oops. It looks like the fun has ended. Now… letting someone this interesting die, would be such a waste…”</p><p><br></p><p>A massive burst of magicules resounded in the area as the forest was torn apart.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm… What should I do? Okay, it’s decided. I will take you in.” Getting a bestie and a minion in one trip. Even Guy would be jealous hahahaha.</p><p><br></p><p>She raced to the boy who noticed her presence and shot towards her, leaving a sonic boom which destroyed a major part of the forest. This was stronger than Rimuru.</p><p><br></p><p>And, he was getting stronger.</p><p><br></p><p>He appeared in front of her face in a moment, trying to punch her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm umm too naive.”</p><p><br></p><p>Milim slapped the boy after she dodged his attack and he crashed into the ground, making a massive crater in the ground, becoming unconscious.</p><p><br></p><p>The aura however was not quelled.</p><p><br></p><p>Milim observed closely.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hoh. He’s evolving. What a surprise? Did he devour all of Charybdis’ magicules and was now evolving?”</p><p><br></p><p>She decided to wait and watch what happens next.</p><p><br></p><p>- ?? -</p><p><br></p><p>The sounds in the distance had ceased. He couldn’t sense Charybdis anywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>But his saviour’s magicules seemed to be getting higher and higher. It was almost out of control but not moving from one place which indicated that he couldn’t move from the place somehow, maybe.</p><p><br></p><p>He noticed that Charybdis was healing itself again and again and in his time in Clayman’s army, he had known that this type of ability was possessed by only one of the five fingers.</p><p><br></p><p>Mjurran of the Ring Finger.</p><p><br></p><p>If she found him in an incapacitated state, she would kill him without a doubt.</p><p><br></p><p>Not to mention, the sleep spell on the child was broken and he was forced to explain the situation to her immediately.</p><p><br></p><p>“Take me to Sensei.” She complained once more and he was starting to feel pressure from the child whose magic was rampaging despite her weakened state.</p><p><br></p><p>If he insisted on moving towards the Dwelling of the Spirits like this, she would without a doubt fight him and he wouldn’t be able to fight back.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, giving up, he nodded and headed towards the place where he could sense the Magiclues of his saviour.</p><p><br></p><p>Upon reaching there, he found a strange scene in front of his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>His saviour was still laying on the ground, his magicules rampaging. There was also Mjurran of the Ring Finger… knocked unconscious. Finally, an aura which he had missed because of his saviour’s aura covering her.</p><p><br></p><p>Her power… it almost made him kneel just taking a feel of it.</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t need anyone to tell him who she was.</p><p><br></p><p>A Demon Lord.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hoh hoh. Are you also Clayman’s lackeys?” She asked, looking both of them down.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl however didn’t care and jumped from his back rushing towards the unconscious man. “Sensei.”</p><p><br></p><p>He quickly kneeled in front of her and begged. “Great Demon Lord, please… spare the child and the man. I beg you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh? I am not killing him, you know? He is so interesting. I am going to make him my minion. But the girl… she doesn’t look like she has much time left.”</p><p><br></p><p>The girl in question turned towards her and stared straight into her eyes. “What is your name?”</p><p><br></p><p>He felt his spine tingle with fear as he looked at the Demon Lord to see if she became angry.</p><p><br></p><p>“Me? I am the best, the cutest and strongest of the Demon Lords, Milim Nava.” The Demon Lord put a hand on her waist and declared proudly, puffing her chest.</p><p><br></p><p>His dread intensified.</p><p><br></p><p>It was her…</p><p><br></p><p>They stood no chance whatsoever.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl however was not privy of this fact. She quickly turned towards her. “Save us. I will make a trade with you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh? Me?” Milim pointed towards herself and the girl nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl quickly took out the pouch on her waist and brought out a brown coloured fruit with a sweet smell and offered it to the Demon Lord. “The best thing we get as a reward from Sensei.”</p><p><br></p><p>Milim looked at the fruit from different angles.</p><p><br></p><p>“Apples? It’s brown. Smells different.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Candied apples. It’s very sweet. Try licking it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Heh, I bet it doesn’t taste anything like honey.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Even better.” The girl insisted.</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t believe it.”Milim retorted with certainty.</p><p><br></p><p>Milim still looked at the brown looking fruit and went stiff.</p><p><br></p><p>She then licked it a few more times and then got into it until it was all gone.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wow! Where did you find this? I want more. Heh, where do you keep those?”</p><p><br></p><p>The girl was at this point trembling from her own magicules but still stood up and answered. “Sensei made this. Help us and I will ask him to make more.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Really? He can make more?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay. But he doesn’t need my help, you know. He is already evolving. He just needs time. You need more help.”</p><p><br></p><p>The girl nodded. “Take us to the Dwelling of Spirits. Sensei said that I can make a contract with spirits to help me. He also wanted to get a blessing from the Spirits.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ramiris’ place? Oh, sure. I was going there anyway. Let’s go. Also, you could just name the red haired guy to reduce your Magicules temporarily. Naming a monster consumes Magicules. It could be used to reduce the stress on yourself.” Milim suggested.</p><p><br></p><p>He was taken aback at the sudden change of topic.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl looked towards him and nodded. “You. Serve my sensei. I name you… umm, Shanks. Yes, Sensei would like it.”</p><p><br></p><p>At this point, he was doubting his life.</p><p><br></p><p>Before he fainted to start the process of evolution, he only had one thought in mind, what was going on here?</p><p><br></p><p>But he was not able to think more as everyone there was picked up and levitated behind the demon lord who tore through the skies into the distance.</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully, he fainted.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Salvatore -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I was in a black space with no other being in the vicinity.</p><p><br></p><p>Sounds kept echoing through my head.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Requirements have been met.

Come out quickly. I need your help.” She shouted.</p><p><br></p><p>All the Spirits in the area scrambled in all directions, running away scared.</p><p><br></p><p>Milim laughed at the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>“Milim! What are you doing here?” Ramiris came in quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Talk later. First help them. Fast, my candied fruits are on the line.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh?”</p><p><br></p><p>The little girl however was smarter as she bowed down. “My name is Chloe O’ Bell, Lady Ramiris. Please, I beg you. Help us make contracts with spirits. My sensei and I need your help.” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Ramiris might act like a child but Milim knew that among all the current Demon Lords, she was probably the kindest one. The most awesome one was obviously Milim herself.</p><p><br></p><p>And as expected her eyes landed on the girl and got serious. “You, why do you want to make a contract with a spirit… well, apart from not wanting to go Kaboom?”</p><p><br></p><p>The girl was however not shaken in the least. “I want to help my Sensei.” She answered resolutely.</p><p><br></p><p>Ramiris took a look at her future minion and her eyes widened.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hehe surprised, aren’t you, Ramiris? This is my future minion. Cool, right? He is also a dragonoid like me. See, see! And I even got an amazing bestie. Now you are the only loner among the Demon Lords. I, Demon Lord Milim Nava, now have friends hahahaha!”</p><p><br></p><p>Ramiris took a closer look and then turned to her in shock. “Where did you find him?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh. I found him while coming here to brag… ah, I mean to inform you about my own awesomeness. He was fighting Charybdis. You know, that little dragon formed from Veldora’s Magicules? One of Clayman’s lackeys was healing it continuously and he still won and then he started evolving. Can a Dragonoid become a Saint, Ramiris?” She suddenly asked a question which was bugging her.</p><p><br></p><p>Ramiris looked to be in thought. “Maybe. Dwarves and Elves can become Saints. I don’t see why Dragonoids can’t become one. As far as I know, as long as they don’t have Demonic Powers, they can be eligible for both Sainthood and receiving Hero’s Egg. You could have qualified for it too, had you not become a Demon Lord. But this boy…” She again took a closer look.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is something wrong?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. There are two souls inside him. One of them is a half human, half dragon soul while the other is the soul of a…True Dragon. It is sealed, although barely, inside the boy.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Wha…” Milim jumped up from her seat in surprise and quickly used her Milim Eye to watch the boy’s soul and sure enough, bound around the boy’s soul was a True Dragon.</p><p><br></p><p>They looked at each other because now, at this point, both of them only had one thought in their heads.</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>They didn’t know this Dragon.</p><p><br></p><p>Ramiris quickly got back into a calmer state. “Do you think Clayman knew about it?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I… don’t know. That Clayman has been very shady lately, trying to make other Demon Lords and all. I was going to prank him after this but…”</p><p><br></p><p>Ramiris then looked at the girl who was standing there quietly and the Ogre or rather Kijin.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sensei, he is an otherworlder, summoned by a human kingdom a few years ago.” She answered.</p><p><br></p><p>Was Clayman trying to make him into a Demon Lord too?</p><p><br></p><p>Another Dragonoid becoming a Demon Lord?</p><p><br></p><p>For just a moment only but Milim remembered her own transformation into a Demon Lord and after a very long time, she felt really angry at that creepy puppet idiot.</p><p><br></p><p>First he tried to plot against her bestie and now this…</p><p><br></p><p>“Milim! Calm down.”</p><p><br></p><p>Milim broke from her thoughts hearing Ramiris’ voice. “Ah, sorry. I just remembered something and now I want to break Clayman’s teeth.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay, let’s discuss these things after the mystery boy wakes up. For now, let’s summon the spirits and see if they can get contracts.”</p><p><br></p><p>Milim nodded and Ramiris led them to the place where the spirits were summoned.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl went ahead first and Ramiris assisted her in summoning the spirit.</p><p><br></p><p>The Spirit which appeared was unlike anything Milim had seen before. It went above her minion and… k-k-kissed him.</p><p><br></p><p>“O-oi what are you doing, perverted spirit?” Milim shouted but it just looked in her direction and winked before rushing and entering the girl’s body. “Oye Ramiris, what kind of perverted spirits do you keep in your place?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I… I haven’t seen her before this?” Even Ramiris was stunned.</p><p><br></p><p>“But how is that possible?” Just what the hell was going on in this world?</p><p><br></p><p>“Anyway, it’s time for the boy. Are you sure you want him to be contracted to a spirit?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, that’s what he was going to do when he came here.” Milim shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>She had taken some time to talk with the two awake members when she was travelling with them.</p><p><br></p><p>Ramiris nodded and summoned a spirit.</p><p><br></p><p>This time the lights in the entire field dulled and a spirit appeared in the middle of the field. Black hair, purple eyes and skin as white as snow. Back nails and black and purple clothes flowed as it went near him and then slowly placed a kiss on his forehead.</p><p><br></p><p>What’s up with these spirits and kissing? Since when did these spirits turn into such perverts?</p><p><br></p><p>Milim was for some reason feeling very annoyed with them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is this done already?” She asked Ramiris so that she could go ahead and kick Clayman’s teeth in.</p><p><br></p><p>“An Elemental Lord of Darkness blessed him. It means that the little Dragonoid is qualified to carry a Hero’s Egg. All he needs is my Blessing.” Ramiris waved a hand on his head and again… kissed his forehead. “There, all done.”</p><p><br></p><p>Done… DONE?</p><p><br></p><p>Today Milim understood the fact that all Spirits were perverts.</p><p><br></p><p>But aside from that, everything was for the best.</p><p><br></p><p>She got a bestie, got to meet another Dragonoid, found out about another True Dragon and now her minion would become a Hero.</p><p><br></p><p>No… maybe as a Hero, he could be her Rival, kinda like how Rudra and Guy were? And when he lost, Milim would ask him to make her all the candied fruits she wanted hahahaha.</p><p><br></p><p>“Umu umu all according to plan.” She nodded to herself.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Interlude -</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Kagali -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Aghh Milim! Once again, it was Milim Nava. Why doesn’t she just mind her own business?!” She threw a vase at the wall, breaking it into pieces.</p><p><br></p><p>“My Lady… but he, the boy, had defeated Charybdis by himself before Milim even intervened. She only stopped him from rampaging. He was hiding a lot of his power. We just couldn’t sense it. He also had some kind of Skill which increased his power drastically and a possibly Legend Ranked Sword. There was another Skill which could immobilise hundreds of monsters in an instant. I don’t think I could fight him head on in a straight fight. Only you or perhaps Laplace could.” Tear replied, making her think again.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy was smarter than anyone had given him any credit for. Everyone had taken him for another teenager who was summoned and lucked out by meeting Shizue Izawa. It seems that this one didn’t just <em>Luck Out</em> but had rather planned or worked on everything from the very start.</p><p><br></p><p>Was he another one like Yuuki?</p><p><br></p><p>First that slime and now this otherworlder.</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>This will not work.</p><p><br></p><p>She will have to remove the dangers to her plan slowly.</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully, Yuuki’s plan was going quite well.</p><p><br></p><p>Clayman would frame and get that Slime killed while ascending to the position of an Awakened Demon Lord and she would finally have someone rivalling those old monsters in her arsenal.</p><p><br></p><p>Till then she will have to bide her time and wait.</p><p><br></p><p>What she didn’t know was that one of her targets had just gone beyond her reach while the other was currently approaching towards the place she was at to fulfil Shizue Izawa’s last wish.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Omake (Salvatore’s Guide to handle Demon Lords) -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Ramiris now went to the girl and started to question her about many things.</p><p><br></p><p>“So how did you know how to talk to Milim and what she would want?”</p><p><br></p><p>The girl was now sitting beside the boy and answered. “Sensei taught us about all the Demon Lords and what we should do if we encountered any one of them. He said that Guy Crimson wouldn’t bother with us. Milim Nava and Dagrule wouldn’t attack people without any reason. Ramiris is actually someone who likes humans a lot and won’t hurt anyone without any reason either. Leon Cromwell and Demon Lord Valentine won’t ever hurt me, not that they would hurt anyone like us without any extreme provocation either and Dino would probably try to sleep than try to kill us. The only one who would hurt us is Demon Lord Clayman.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ramiris nodded. “Correct.”</p><p><br></p><p>“He then taught us how to negotiate with some of them. For Miss Milim and you, he asked us to offer sweets.” She replied.</p><p><br></p><p>Milim nodded to herself. “Yup. My future minion is smart.”</p><p><br></p><p>_______________________________x_____________________________________________________________x______________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on pat-re-on.-com/crossedge.

My new parents loved me more than their lives.</p><p><br></p><p>I inherited the blonde hair of my mother and blue eyes from my father along with his lady killer looks.</p><p><br></p><p>Four years later, I got a cute little brother. I never had any siblings in my last life and always wanted a cute younger sibling to have fun with. My younger brother was adorable. I will fight anyone who says otherwise.</p><p><br></p><p>But things changed.</p><p><br></p><p>At the age of six, eight years ago, both my parents suddenly passed away and I was left with a two year old brother and nowhere to go.</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully, I was taken in by the orphanage and it has been our home for the last eight years.</p><p><br></p><p>Thanks to my previous knowledge, I was much more advanced than other people of my own age and did well in school and the training provided by the church for self defence.</p><p><br></p><p>I was offered a chance to train under the church but I rejected it because I was more interested in sciences. The matron was disappointed but didn’t force me to join. She did insist on it for a while but later saw that my heart was not in it and let me be.</p><p><br></p><p>Our relationship had become a bit colder since then.</p><p><br></p><p>Well, I was a full grown adult in a child’s body. My thought process was already more or less set. It’s not like I didn’t believe in God or was an atheist. I was a reincarnator. If there was ever a miracle, this was one. I believed. I just didn’t think it was the place for me.</p><p><br></p><p>My heart was not in it so I didn’t pursue it. I did help around though.</p><p><br></p><p>I saw my brother come running towards me. A girl slightly older than him followed him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Brother, this is Big Sis Tressa. I met her in the Church choir. She is also going to join us in the Church’s training.” he jumped in excitement as he introduced her to me.</p><p><br></p><p>I gave the girl my best smile which I may or may not have practised in front of the mirror for years. “Thank you for taking care of my little brother, Miss Tressa. You are a very kind girl.”</p><p><br></p><p>The girl gained a hue of red on her cheeks as she looked at me. \"Th-thank you. I-I was only h-helping.\"</p><p><br></p><p>It works every time.</p><p><br></p><p>We talked for a while and then Tressa left.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Brother!\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hmm?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Do you not like it when I train in the church?\" </p><p><br></p><p>He asked, a bit hesitant.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Why won't I like it?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I mean you didn't go to church for training…\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"So I wouldn't like it if you went there?\"</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded a bit nervously at my question.</p><p><br></p><p>I laughed and hugged him to my side while I squeezed his cheeks.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I don't mind it. I didn't join the church training because my heart was not in it. Hmm, how do I explain it? Yes. Let's try this. Imagine this for once. I don't like broccoli but you do, don't you?\"</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded. </p><p><br></p><p>\"So, does it mean I should hate you for that?\"</p><p><br></p><p>He shook his head cutely and I pinched his nose.</p><p><br></p><p>\"So then why would I hate you for doing something you like as long as it doesn't harm anyone?\"</p><p><br></p><p>He pouted. \"B-but that's not the same.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Of course it is. I don't like something and so I am not doing it. You like something and so you are doing it. If we start disliking others for not having the same tastes as us, we will be hating everyone. That's not how things work. You like the church's training and reading the Bible verses in front of everyone. Do it. Follow your heart. I am proud of you that you are doing it already. No matter what happens, big bro will always support you.\"</p><p><br></p><p>He returned my hug tightly. \"Thank you, Sal.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. Sal. That's my name. Sal… or rather Salvatore.</p><p><br></p><p>_____________________________________x_____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>A week had passed since the talk with my brother.</p><p><br></p><p>Today, I was getting back from my classes to the orphanage.</p><p><br></p><p>My classes went late and it was already night and the rain was coming down hard. I forgot to bring my umbrella.</p><p><br></p><p>Fuck, my shoes are going to get all soggy.</p><p><br></p><p>And then it happened.</p><p><br></p><p>I suddenly heard a loud rumbling sound behind me as if thunder had crashed. The whole area lit up and everything turned black..</p><p><br></p><p>The surroundings were completely black. It was as if I was floating in space.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t know if I was breathing.</p><p><br></p><p>I couldn’t even hear my heartbeat.</p><p><br></p><p>My thoughts were very clear.</p><p><br></p><p>Did I die?</p><p><br></p><p>Did I get struck by thunder?</p><p><br></p><p>What the fuck, dude?</p><p><br></p><p>Wasn’t I a reincarnator?</p><p><br></p><p>That was a pretty pathetic way for one to die?</p><p><br></p><p>Aren’t reincarnators supposed to be chosen ones?</p><p><br></p><p>But a chosen one wouldn’t die like this.</p><p><br></p><p>So I guess I am not one of them.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>I really wish I was favoured too.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Request Accepted.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Processing…</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Extra Skill: Favoured One granted.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p>Hmm?</p><p><br></p><p>And I want to become stronger.

Only a fool waiting to be slaughtered.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>R<em>equest Processing….</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Unique Skill: Evolver granted.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p>My consciousness started fading with it.</p><p><br></p><p>I hope my brother remains safe.</p><p><br></p><p>Sorry, I left you alone.</p><p><br></p><p>Goodbye… Isaiah.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Additional Soul detected within the host.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Processing.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Soul Incomplete, dormant and sealed.

Looking around the room, I saw people dressed in what looked to be mediaeval costumes.</p><p><br></p><p>On my side were three other beds with what looked to be Japanese people around 17 or so. Two boys and a girl. The boys had black and white hair and the girl was a brunette.</p><p><br></p><p>They were talking in a language I didn’t know.</p><p><br></p><p>One of them noticed me waking and hurried outside.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe she went to inform someone.</p><p><br></p><p>While this happened, I tried to get my thoughts together.</p><p><br></p><p>Just what the fuck was happening?</p><p><br></p><p>A few moments later, another person came on following the woman.</p><p><br></p><p>He spoke to me but I couldn't understand the words.</p><p><br></p><p>On realising this, he brought his fingers to his neck and it flashed with a grey colour.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Welcome summoned Otherworlders. My name is Ibam Razen, the Court Mage from the Great Nation of Falmuth….\"</p><p><br></p><p>At this point I could only think of one thing.</p><p><br></p><p>'Oh fuck.'</p><p><br></p><p><strong>– Two Years Later –</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I fell on my back heaving for breath. The area in front of me was filled with cuts and scorch marks.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the sword in my hand and winced as I picked it up once more.</p><p><br></p><p>I was not struck by lightning.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn't die either.</p><p><br></p><p>I was fucking summoned to another world.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean, what are the chances of this?</p><p><br></p><p>A Reincarnator like me getting summoned as an Isekai <em>Hero</em>.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, not everything was as cool as it sounded.</p><p><br></p><p>I remembered the name Falmuth Kingdom and Razen.</p><p><br></p><p>But that was only a doubt at the start.</p><p><br></p><p>It only became clear when I found out the names of the other summoned people.</p><p><br></p><p>Kirara Mizutani, Kyoya Tachibana and Shogo Taguchi.</p><p><br></p><p>I was in the kingdom who attacked Rimuru Motherfucking Tempest and got pincushioned by solar rays.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, I will not lie, it was one of the best scenes from the anime I could remember. But… when I think of the fact that I would be on the other end of <em>that</em>, it is not as cool anymore.</p><p><br></p><p>In this place, we were prisoners of the nation, basically slaves.</p><p><br></p><p>Each of us had a Lock Spell cast on us which forced us to obey them.</p><p><br></p><p>We were used to doing their dirty jobs.</p><p><br></p><p>These people were not the only ones either. Every human nation in this world did this.</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully, the ritual can only be used once every eighty years or so and forcing the ritual causes children to appear who do not have any power or else these people would have entire armies full of otherworldly slaves.</p><p><br></p><p>Running away was nigh impossible because the armies and other mages kept a watch over us at all times.</p><p><br></p><p>Not to mention that bastard Razen.</p><p><br></p><p>I remember him stealing the bodies of the otherworlders to regain his youth and Skills.</p><p><br></p><p>Fortunately, my own Skill, at least the one they knew about, was an auxiliary one which he wasn’t really interested in.</p><p><br></p><p>Delete Field.</p><p><br></p><p>The ability to nullify magic in a certain area. It was a good ability but the area covered by the spell depended directly on my strength. Moreover, there was already a spell which could replicate the same result and thus my ability was not considered much. But since I did have a skill, I was not considered a failure. They still used me as a soldier because Otherworlders had greater amounts of Magicules and were in general stronger.</p><p><br></p><p>Not to mention, those that didn’t inherit the Unique Skills generally died soon after.</p><p><br></p><p>My Skill was not a Unique Skill.</p><p><br></p><p>They were not wrong either.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, if only that were so. I thought to myself as I got up once more.</p><p><br></p><p>My other Skills are not ones that can be seen from outside or even felt.</p><p><br></p><p>The Unique Skill Evolver and the Extra Skill Favoured One.</p><p><br></p><p>The contents of the Skills can be felt instinctively. We need to experiment and learn more about them. After all, not everyone has an all knowing Cheat like Rimuru.</p><p><br></p><p>From my experience, I found out a few things about my Skills.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Unique Skill: Evolver</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Increases the speed of the user's growth.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>The speed of growth increases the more the user desires for growth.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p>The best thing about this Skill is that it even gives slight resistances to things I have been exposed to and which have been harmful to me. The resistance depends on the amount I have survived.</p><p><br></p><p>I have since then gotten a few resistances.</p><p><br></p><p>Lesser Pain Resistance from the training and attacks, Moderate Miasma Resistance from being forced to hunt in infected areas, Lesser Mental Resistance, etc.</p><p><br></p><p>These Skills were added to the Common Skills.</p><p><br></p><p>The Ranking of the Skills are Common Skills, Extra Skills, Unique Skills and Ultimate Skills.</p><p><br></p><p>So the fact about me dying a year or so later is merely a hoax as well as a good cover.</p><p><br></p><p>These people send us to fight their battles or clear monsters and enemies that normally cause too many casualties among their people.</p><p><br></p><p>For this very reason, the Evolver Skill is continuously stimulated due to the constant danger I am in.</p><p><br></p><p>This caused the amount of Magicules I could manipulate to increase. Normal humans cannot have magicules in their body but I was an exception as I had an incomplete Dragon’s Core inside my body by some chance. Maybe something to do with the summoning and wishes. This caused my body to get an ability to retain magicules without becoming a Majin.</p><p><br></p><p>This obviously cannot be felt by anyone because any attempt was just negated by me with my Delete Field inside my body.</p><p><br></p><p>This caused people to believe that my magicules were increasing very quickly and I barely had a year left.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t mind it either.</p><p><br></p><p>My aim is to become stronger and be able to overpower Razen’s Lock Spell on me to get out of his control and then disappear.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, my Delete Field could probably also affect the Lock Spell if I were to reach a certain level of strength once.</p><p><br></p><p>I might even try to visit the Monster Nation Tempest if it was even created.</p><p><br></p><p>Shaking my head, I got up from my seat and picked up my sword.</p><p><br></p><p>We were their living weapons.</p><p><br></p><p>Weapons needed to be strong and while I was at best, a defective piece, I still possessed an insane amount of magicules and they wanted to use it for every last bit.</p><p><br></p><p>I was taught the Arts and Magic of the Human Race in this world.</p><p><br></p><p>Monsters use Skills and their natural ability to manipulate Magicules to cast spells. Humans on the other hand had to learn Arts.</p><p><br></p><p>To understand it in simpler terms, Skills are automatic and Arts are manual. The users have to put effort into learning and using them. The user can directly use a specific magic by using an associated Skill, without even knowing its details while for Arts, they need to know how to create a Magic Circle and the process involved in the working for the spell. The former’s effects are stronger as Skills are essentially rewarded by the world itself. So they are in a way permitted by the world itself while the latter is forced by the use of magicules.</p><p><br></p><p>“Salvatore.”</p><p><br></p><p>I suddenly heard a voice behind me and saw Razen coming towards me being followed by Folgen, the Vice Commander of the forces.</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly hid my scowl.</p><p><br></p><p>It was probably another massacre or something.</p><p><br></p><p>“How is your training going?”</p><p><br></p><p>“My progress has been steady, Lord Razen.”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded before using a spell to check my body.</p><p><br></p><p>He frowned a little. “The level of magicules has again risen. Keep up the good work.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, Lord Razen.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We have a job for you. In the eastern part of the kingdom, a town has not been contacting the kingdom for months now. It has been isolated and we think that the town was probably attacked by a pack of C Ranked Dire Wolves headed by a B Ranked one in the nearby forest. You are to go there and exterminate them. A group of mages and a squadron of soldiers will be following you in this task as well. Get ready, you are leaving in an hour.”</p><p><br></p><p>I just nodded my head and took my leave. The less I spoke with him the better.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Razen -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He watched the boy walk away towards the quarters and let out a sigh</p><p><br></p><p>“Something bothering you, Razen?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Such a waste… for such a talent to not inherit a Unique Skill and die early. If he had lived for a few more years, we could have another one rivalling Hinata Sakaguchi and Falmuth would have cut its way through the west.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. He does work tirelessly. Perhaps trying to defy the fate that has already been decided for him. Still, he is much better than those three. They are…”</p><p><br></p><p>“All talk, no talent. If only his Delete Field was a scale higher. It would have been a perfect Skill for anyone. I don’t need it because I can just make an antimagic area but such a skill can still be useful in battle. See that you witness his death, Folgen. Even if it is not a Unique Skill, it is still useful for someone like you. And if those wastes show incompetence, sacrifice them at his hands. Their behaviour must already have gotten them at each other’s throat by the end of the first month.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Those three seem to enjoy bullying him. They are probably laying out their own frustrations on someone they can. But I have never seen him retaliate.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s because he can’t. Even if he puts out a good fight, he will lose at the end of it. In terms of sheer skill, he could have killed the three of them alone if only they were at equal levels of strength but… that’s not the case. The boy is smart and keeps his anger hidden. If he does get the opportunity, he will retaliate. If he awakens a Unique Skill by the end of it, we will still be the ones profiting.”</p><p><br></p><p>They watched the boy leave and left for their own jobs too.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Salvatore -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The town of Larkinge is on the eastern part of the Falmuth Kingdom. It is one of the towns nearing the border of Jura Forest.</p><p><br></p><p>The main occupation of the people of this town is hunting and collecting herbs in the forest outskirts.</p><p><br></p><p>The capital hasn’t received any news or, more importantly, tribute from these people for a while. They sent messengers but they never returned.</p><p><br></p><p>There was said to be a pack of Dire wolves nearby and the locals had complained about it several times but they were not rich enough to pay adventurers or worth much for the Kingdom to pay attention to the whining as they said in the capital.</p><p><br></p><p>But a few months of revenue builds up.</p><p><br></p><p>There were guesses that one of the wolves might have evolved into a higher rank and must have taken over the town.</p><p><br></p><p>They wanted me to help slay the wolf pack.</p><p><br></p><p>The soldiers were mostly average run of the mill. The only ones of any value were the mages.</p><p><br></p><p>Upon reaching the area, the head mage of the group took charge and sent search parties through the town to find any survivors.</p><p><br></p><p>The town looked like a ghost town with no sign of life.</p><p><br></p><p>I too moved along the borders of the town to find any people.</p><p><br></p><p>We didn’t find anything after hours of searching and decided to set up camp.</p><p><br></p><p>I went a distance away from the camp to practise my arts once again.</p><p><br></p><p>I needed to become stronger. To break past the first barrier and Evolve.</p><p><br></p><p>Humans in this world evolve differently.</p><p><br></p><p>First is the easiest way, by becoming part monster. They are called Majin or Demonoid. There people are generally looked down upon and may even be hunted down by the church.</p><p><br></p><p>Majin can then grow in the Monster tree as a Demon Lord Seed and an Awakened Demon Lord from that.</p><p><br></p><p>For Pure Humans to evolve, they need to train their skills to the limits and push themselves to break their limits. The first Evolution of the Human kind is called a Sage or Enlightened One.</p><p><br></p><p>They are extremely strong and are a half spiritual sort of creature.</p><p><br></p><p>Upon reaching this stage, a human’s lifespan increases greatly as well as the amount of Magicules they can control.</p><p><br></p><p>Enlightened Ones can be as strong as a Demon Lord Seed.</p><p><br></p><p>Then comes the Saint Rank but I have no idea how to reach that level.</p><p><br></p><p>I had a good memory but even I couldn’t remember everything from my previous life, especially when it has been sixteen years since then.</p><p><br></p><p>I remembered only the bits and pieces of things from the webnovels I had read. It was only finding out the information and piecing it with my own knowledge helped me remember things more.</p><p><br></p><p>Another evolution for Humans is to become a Hero but I have no idea how to go about it.</p><p><br></p><p>I know there was something about Elementals involved in it but I didn’t know exactly what it was.</p><p><br></p><p>But it didn’t matter. I knew that becoming an Enlightened is already enough for me to leave this cage.</p><p><br></p><p>Until now, I have been working hard to push my limits but training can only push me so much.</p><p><br></p><p>I need an opportunity.</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes I wonder if my other Extra Skill, The Favoured One is just for show.</p><p><br></p><p>It basically gives me good Luck and some kind of Charisma. Or at least that’s what the Skill says. I don’t know exactly what it does though.</p><p><br></p><p>My Charisma didn’t keep others from bullying me.</p><p><br></p><p>My Luck has seen me enslaved upon being summoned.</p><p><br></p><p>If this is my Luck and Charisma after having the Skill, I wonder what it was before it.</p><p><br></p><p>My attention was drawn by a large explosion in the area where the camp was set up.</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly ran towards the area and the scene I witnessed in front of me chilled my spine.</p><p><br></p><p>Blood and fire all around the place. Shouts of the soldiers and mages sounded and in the middle of all this chaos was that… that thing.</p><p><br></p><p>Black skin, sharp teeth, violet eyes and a thick miasma that made one sick just looking at it.</p><p><br></p><p>“D-demon! It’s a Greater Demon! Run! We are not prepared to deal with these things!” One of the mages ran or rather tried to do so only to have its head blown away.</p><p><br></p><p>The Head Mage spotted me and quickly ordered. “Stop it! Hold it back! Kill it, quick!”</p><p><br></p><p>The bastard was trying to escape and was just throwing fodders at it to be able to delay it. And me being bound by the curse had to follow.</p><p><br></p><p>The good thing was that soon after the order, he also got a fire to his back and died.</p><p><br></p><p>I was free, but… there was nowhere to run.</p><p><br></p><p>I knew I couldn’t outrun a Greater Demon,</p><p><br></p><p>These fucking things were A- Ranked. Outrunning it would be a fool’s dream.</p><p><br></p><p>I drew my sword and prepared to resist.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not going to just bend over my back and die.</p><p><br></p><p>I rushed at it with a Quick Step. Putting some aura under my foot, I pushed the ground, my sword drawn over my head as I let out a slash.</p><p><br></p><p>The demon made several magical barriers in front of itself.</p><p><br></p><p>“Delete Field.”</p><p><br></p><p>A blackish field spread around me as the Barriers collapsed as quickly as they had formed.</p><p><br></p><p>The demon was surprised and it let me get a hit. I took out one of its eyes as it growled in anger.</p><p><br></p><p>The sound hit my eardrums disorienting me for a moment and gave it some time to get away.</p><p><br></p><p>It took to the skies quickly making distance between us.</p><p><br></p><p>And then things turned for the worse. It started blasting the area.</p><p><br></p><p>I dodged.</p><p><br></p><p>The problem with my Delete Field Skill is that it doesn’t stop the spells that are already invoked. It just stops the invocation of the spell.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s the reason why they could even use the Lock Spell on me.</p><p><br></p><p>The battle reached an impossible situation for me.</p><p><br></p><p>I couldn’t fly and the demon was using this fact as he wanted. My ranged attacks were not good enough against a demon who is a being of magic itself.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly I felt dizzy and was slow by a step, getting caught up in the shockwaves of a blast.</p><p><br></p><p>The shockwave forced all the air out of my lungs and I fell to the ground.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Cough cough</em></p><p><br></p><p>I covered my mouth and saw blood.</p><p><br></p><p>Poison?</p><p><br></p><p>That bastard was using poison mixed with its blasts.</p><p><br></p><p>“Gwahahahaha what a fool. Did you think you could use such a silly trick to fight me?”</p><p><br></p><p>The demon slowly came down, now confident of its win.</p><p><br></p><p>I shakily tried to get up, only to be kicked in the stomach and flew aside towards the burning walls of a building and crashed into it.</p><p><br></p><p>The world blacked out for a moment.</p><p><br></p><p>Shit.</p><p><br></p><p>Am I going to die?</p><p><br></p><p>I will not accept this.</p><p><br></p><p>“Your soul will be delicious. I will savour it slowly.”</p><p><br></p><p>The footsteps of the demon sounded louder as it walked towards me.</p><p><br></p><p>The scenes of both my lives flashed before my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>My first life and my parents.</p><p><br></p><p>My second life, my new parents, my little brother Ishiah.</p><p><br></p><p>I wonder how he is?</p><p><br></p><p>Does he even know I was summoned to another world or does he think that I left him alone?</p><p><br></p><p>Shit.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t want it to end like this.</p><p><br></p><p>Tears dripped down my face and a deep indignation rose from my heart.</p><p><br></p><p>I never hurt anyone. Never did anything bad to anyone, so why is this happening to me?</p><p><br></p><p>Dragged away from my home, made into a slave and now…</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t accept it!.</p><p><br></p><p>I will not accept it!.</p><p><br></p><p>I clenched my teeth and picked up the sword.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, trying to resist even now. You cannot win against me. You are an inferior species. Don’t you learn, <em>fool</em>?” It mocked.</p><p><br></p><p>“The wise learn from the mistakes of others and fools learn from their own. So… I guess I am a fool. That said, how would I know… if I don’t even try. If I have to become a fool to have this chance, then I am fine with being a fool. But once, even if I cannot kill you, I want to punch that ugly face of yours. Just once. Dammit, JUST ONCE.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Balance Breaker</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p>“What!”</p><p><br></p><p>I felt a surge of power from inside me and had the urge to roar.</p><p><br></p><p>The blackish field spread out from inside me but this time it was much more potent and the range was huge. The name came to my mind and I shouted it out.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“Negation Zone.”</em></p><p><br></p><p>Demons or Daemons are spiritual creatures, made entirely of magic. They don’t generally have a specific shape or body and can change their shape as they will. They can occupy other bodies but that’s quite rare.</p><p><br></p><p>This however makes it so that when magic is disabled, they are generally powerless. There were exceptions though but a greater demon like this… not really.</p><p><br></p><p>And as expected the Demon fell to his knees.</p><p><br></p><p>I pushed a quarter of my aura on my leg and smashed the ground. The rest of my aura was concentrated on the tip of my sword. The recoil shattered a bone on my leg but the adrenaline kept driving me forward.</p><p><br></p><p>The Demon looked up but didn’t have any time to dodge as I directly pierced its head with my sword.</p><p><br></p><p>It turned to ashes and dispersed into the air.</p><p><br></p><p>I fell down. The power surge leaving my body.</p><p><br></p><p>The poison finally overcoming the adrenaline rush.</p><p><br></p><p>Several thoughts went through my mind as my head was blacking out.</p><p><br></p><p>I defeated it.</p><p><br></p><p>Balance Breaker. I had a vague memory of this word.</p><p><br></p><p>Wasn’t it from that dumb anime with boobs and stuff?</p><p><br></p><p>How the fuck did I have one of those?</p><p><br></p><p>Was my previous work… oh crap!</p><p><br></p><p>And then I blacked out.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Requirements have been met.

Although the potion helped, your body was still injured. Your evolution has fixed most of the wounds but it can be a bit taxing to push yourself for now.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at her while at the same time my mind thought about her words.</p><p><br></p><p>Evolution?</p><p><br></p><p>Did I evolve?</p><p><br></p><p>I was feeling a lot stronger.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, just by clenching my fists, I could feel a lot of power surging in my body. Magicules were moving a lot faster and smoother.</p><p><br></p><p>“Who are you?” I asked cautiously.</p><p><br></p><p>She raised her hands as a sign of peace. “I mean no harm. My name is Shizue Izawa. I am an otherworlder like you.”</p><p><br></p><p>Shizue Izawa?</p><p><br></p><p>“The Conqueror of Flames, Shizue?” I asked, surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded. Although I noticed her wince at the name.</p><p><br></p><p>I however was still suspicious. “Pardon me. I know I am being rude but I have come to learn that trusting someone easily can lead to bad things. Can you do something to prove your identity?”</p><p><br></p><p>“How do I do so?” She asked, not being offended by my request.</p><p><br></p><p>“Can you summon any of your spirits? I know that Shizue Izawa has a contract with a Greater Spirit called Ifrit, or you can show me your mask. I also have heard a lot about these two.”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at me for a moment and then nodded as she brought out a mask from her cloak. White coloured with slits for eyes and two designs on the sides.</p><p><br></p><p>She put it on and her magical presence became constrained.</p><p><br></p><p>Just as I had heard about the famed mask of the Conqueror of Flames.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.” I relaxed my posture a bit. “Can you tell me how you found me? I didn’t think there were other people around. We checked and didn’t find anyone in the entire village.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I was chasing the demon but he escaped from me. I was tracking it down but reached this place a bit later. I… witnessed you battling. Your magicules… you were summoned without a Unique Skill, weren’t you?”</p><p><br></p><p>I became quiet.</p><p><br></p><p>“No need to fear. I was once in the same situation.” She sat down on the floor in front of the door. “Even now, I sometimes cannot control the Spirit inside me. It is painful. It is terrifying. You are not wrong to feel what you are feeling. Being dragged away from your home and enslaved, being forced to fight wars for others against your will.Trusting others is difficult.”</p><p><br></p><p>I stiffened. “How do you know…”</p><p><br></p><p>“I saw the Lock Curse when I was checking your body for injuries. The curse faded when you evolved. You are free now. Congratulations.”</p><p><br></p><p>I snapped back to reality at this revelation and checked my body. The curse was indeed gone.</p><p><br></p><p>Strength left my feet as relief washed over me. I fell to my knees and cried. I sobbed like a child.</p><p><br></p><p>I was free.</p><p><br></p><p>I was free once more.</p><p><br></p><p>I felt a warmth envelop me.</p><p><br></p><p>Shizue was now hugging me. I… wrapped my hands around her and cried even more.</p><p><br></p><p>I remembered everything I had done since being summoned.</p><p><br></p><p>My position was already made clear to me.</p><p><br></p><p>I was a slave.</p><p><br></p><p>I felt repulsed.</p><p><br></p><p>To fight against my will for the selfishness of others.</p><p><br></p><p>I remembered the first life I was forced to take. The look of horror on the face of the man whom I was to execute.</p><p><br></p><p>The feeling of my blade piercing the man’s chest and the blood splattering all over my face. The memory had haunted me for months. And then… I just got used to it.</p><p><br></p><p>I took so many lives that I became numb to the feeling.</p><p><br></p><p>At that point, the only thought that remained inside me was escaping the prison no matter how.</p><p><br></p><p>I had become a monster who didn’t care about the lives of people just like the ones who had summoned me.</p><p><br></p><p>And that knowledge disgusted me.</p><p><br></p><p>That was one of the reasons I didn’t reply or retaliate to any bullying. It was because somehow I felt that I deserved it.</p><p><br></p><p>The other three who were summoned put all the blame on this world, the people of this world and thus they didn’t hesitate about killing.</p><p><br></p><p>To vent out their frustrations.</p><p><br></p><p>But I knew. I already knew a bit about this world. The common people… how were they to blame.</p><p><br></p><p>It was the fault of the ones at the top. It was their greed and ambition that caused this situation to befall on me.</p><p><br></p><p>But now… it is all over. </p><p><br></p><p>Today… I was free again.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t know how long I cried and she comforted me.</p><p><br></p><p>My body was far stronger than before but I was still mentally exhausted and fell asleep.</p><p><br></p><p>____________________________________________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I woke up after a few hours.</p><p><br></p><p>Shizue was still there, waiting.</p><p><br></p><p>I got up and apologised to her about yesterday.</p><p><br></p><p>At this point there was no doubt that she was the real one, or at least that she didn't mean me any harm. She already had plenty of time for that.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Are you alright now?\"</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded my head.</p><p><br></p><p>\"What do you want to do now?\" She asked and I paused for a moment.</p><p><br></p><p>What did I want to do?</p><p><br></p><p>The first thought that came to my mind along with the memory of a face made my reply. \"I want to go back home.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Her face took on a pained look. \"I am afraid that there aren't…\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"There is a way. I know there is a way. Don't ask me how I know of it but I just do.\"</p><p><br></p><p>She took a deep breath and then continued. \"So, how will you go around doing that?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I… I want to become stronger. Can… Can you teach me?\"</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at me for a moment and nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>And this started my journey with Shizue Izawa in this new world.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>– Razen –</strong></p><p><br></p><p>\"A demon.\" He sighed at the massacre in front of his eyes and sighed.</p><p><br></p><p>The miasma and demonic energy in the area were a dead giveaway.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Did you find any survivors?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"No Sir. Only pieces of corpses.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Did you find the body of the otherworlder?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"N.. No Sir. We only found pieces of his armour and sword.\"</p><p><br></p><p>As he thought. His Lock Curse had been broken too.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Che, what a waste. He couldn't even handle a simple demon. Then again he was a failure to start with. Fucking pussy.\" He heard Shogo's mockery from the side and felt a twinge of anger.</p><p><br></p><p>Mocking a demon, which was probably a Greater Demon from the destruction of the area. A Greater Demon would have crushed him easily and yet he bragged. A newborn calf fears no tiger. It was really bad luck that he got the Unique Skill instead of Salvatore.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Gather the mages and seal the miasma in the area. Collect the corpses of the deceased and burn them to prevent them from turning into undead.\"</p><p><br></p><p>What he didn’t know was that the one he thought was dead, was already travelling away from the kingdom with a new teacher.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Salvatore -</strong></p><p>Travelling with Shizue was a whole new experience.</p><p><br></p><p>She, despite her young looks, was in her nineties and had travelled the world for decades.</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t hesitate in teaching me anything I asked for. Starting with magic.</p><p><br></p><p>The Magic of this world was interesting and as an Enlightened, I had a very easy time learning magic.</p><p><br></p><p>In this time, I even tried and got familiar with my new Skills.</p><p><br></p><p>I was not really familiar with the Highschool DxD world. I had at best read two volumes of the Light Novels and the protagonist of the story was just too cringy for me.</p><p><br></p><p>I did read a few fanfictions and my knowledge about the world was shoddy at best.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, I did know what Sacred Gears and Balance Breakers were.</p><p><br></p><p>I was apparently born with a Dragon Type Sacred Gear which was attached to my soul and its power was changed into my own Skill.</p><p><br></p><p>The Sacred Gear was also the reason why I had almost double the amount of Skills compared to the other Otherworlders.</p><p><br></p><p>The Balance Breaker gave me a boost which increased my power by a lot.</p><p><br></p><p>According to Shizue, I could reach higher levels of Enlightened strength while using it. She likened it to how an Elemental would merge with a Human and give them powers but much weaker and temporary.</p><p><br></p><p>I could even match Shizue in terms of power when in the Balance Breaker but that’s where the  difference in our experience and the affinity between her and Ifirit showed.</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t need any energy to use Ifrit and it even provided her with energy of her own, while I needed to expend energy to maintain the Balance Breaker.</p><p><br></p><p>The Delete Field and the Draconic Core were not my own power.</p><p><br></p><p>Evolver was probably a Skill of the Sacred Gear’s bullshit of evolving according to the user’s will. I remember there being something like that. So only the Fortunate One was my own Skills.</p><p><br></p><p>Although it became my own power after I received the Skills.</p><p><br></p><p>On my evolution, the Sacred Gear seemed to have unlocked some more of its powers and I got another Skill, Shadow Prison.</p><p><br></p><p>But all those were probably nothing compared to my newest Skill.</p><p><br></p><p>Unique Skill: The Fool.</p><p><br></p><p>A fool learns from his own mistakes.</p><p><br></p><p>This Skill was the embodiment of this saying.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a passive Skill which copies any Skill used during a fight which I lose.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, if I sparred with Shizue and lost and she used her own Skills during the fight, I would get all the skills she used in the duration of the fight. Obviously, I couldn’t copy Ultimate Skills because only Ultimate Skills can face other Ultimate Skills while my ‘The Fool’ was only Unique.</p><p><br></p><p>It was in a way broken if used wisely.</p><p><br></p><p>I laughed so hard when I realised what this Skill did.</p><p><br></p><p>With this, I got into the business of Skill collection.</p><p><br></p><p>The first Skills I copied were from Shizue… unknowingly.</p><p><br></p><p>I copied her Unique Skill: Degenerate and a couple of Extra Skills.</p><p><br></p><p>The Unique Skill: Degenerate was a jackpot for me.</p><p><br></p><p>It had two functions. Separation and Synthesis.</p><p><br></p><p>Separation can separate anything, even Skills except those bound to someone’s soul from them while Synthesis can combine any two things, including Skills.</p><p><br></p><p>The utter cheat ability of this Skill was only bound by the fact that Shizue was not a murderhobo intending to destroy the world or she could have easily become a Demon Lord by now.</p><p><br></p><p>My experiments did help me realise the ability of my own Skill, The Fool.</p><p><br></p><p>I did confess to her but her reply was quite unexpected… or should I say, rather expected for her.</p><p><br></p><p>She was not angry with me either. For her, she just taught her student a Skill which would help him live in this world safely.</p><p><br></p><p>She also tutored me in Swordsmanship.</p><p><br></p><p>Shizue had learned Swordsmanship from one of the Subordinates of the Demon Lord Leon Cromwell and the Masked Hero Chronoa and honed it against monsters and demons for decades.</p><p><br></p><p>She was undoubtedly one of the best sword users in this world and many compared her to the Dwarven King, Gazel Dwargo in terms of her skills.</p><p><br></p><p>She was also the teacher of two of the most prominent figures in this world.</p><p><br></p><p>Hinata Sakaguchi and Yuuki Kagurazaka and a less known but probably the strongest, Chloe Aubert.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, my memory about this world was hazy at best but even I knew that Yuuki Kagurazaka was one of the villains. Obviously there could be changes in this world but it was better to err on the side of caution.</p><p><br></p><p>For her, I was one of her best students and she did everything she could to make me stronger and assist in my goal of finding a way back home.</p><p><br></p><p>She told me about a lot of Skills which I could copy and which would help me balance out my arsenal.</p><p><br></p><p>We also talked about a lot of things. She was from Japan from the World War era. She was caught in a bomb blast when she was summoned.</p><p><br></p><p>When she arrived in this world, she was burned and dying. Demon Lord Leon Cromwell was the one who summoned her and she was only four years old back then.</p><p><br></p><p>He took pity on her and summoned a Spirit, the very same one which gave her the title of ‘The Conqueror of Flames’ and bound her with it.</p><p><br></p><p>She survived and soon healed.</p><p><br></p><p>But that was not all. She couldn’t control her powers and Ifrit killed one of her close ones.</p><p><br></p><p>She started resenting this power and using all her might to control it instead of merging with it. And now, as a result, she is dying.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. Over the past few months I noticed that she was slipping in her control.</p><p><br></p><p>I wanted to help her and also asked her to merge with Ifrit but she denied.</p><p><br></p><p>She wanted to die a human. It was her final wish.</p><p><br></p><p>And somehow I couldn’t say anything to her.</p><p><br></p><p>I remembered that she was Rimuru’s Fated One and he devoured her body after her death on her request.</p><p><br></p><p>It set up a series of events which saved this world.</p><p><br></p><p>Am I too selfish in trying to prevent those events because of my attachment to my teacher?</p><p><br></p><p>To let a person who has lived a full life die according to their wishes or force them to live a life they don’t wish for my own wishes? The answer to this question is not something I would know.</p><p><br></p><p>I on the other hand shared with her my secret of being a reincarnator who was summoned to this world. I told her about my cute little brother and the reason I wanted to get back.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t tell her about this world being a novel in my first life though. Telling someone on the verge of death that their entire life was a novel and used as entertainment… seemed very cruel to me.</p><p><br></p><p>We travelled through several countries together and in doing so met several people.</p><p><br></p><p>And today is another such visit.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, this is the Dwarven Capital. The place does look grand.” I looked at the magnificent walls of the kingdom. It was nothing like the Falmuth Kingdom and was radiating power even when one looked at it straight.</p><p><br></p><p>“Dwarves remain neutral and they are the best craftsmen among the races of this world. You need a good weapon for yourself. We can get it here.”</p><p><br></p><p>Shizue’s fame was quite well established even among the Dwarven Nation as was shown when we didn’t need to wait in line like the others and were directly given a pass.</p><p><br></p><p>The city was grand like the mediaeval european cities from earth.</p><p><br></p><p>“Kajin of the dwarves is one of the best sword makers in the world. He is an old acquaintance of mine and owes me a few favours.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The Dwarven Nation is quite peaceful.” I commented as I looked around the place. Several races roamed around and yet no one caused any trouble.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s because of Gazel Dwargo. He is a man who can rival Demon Lords in terms of strength. He is a saint.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A Saint!” I asked, shocked internally.</p><p><br></p><p>A Saint was the human equivalent to an Awakened Demon Lord.</p><p><br></p><p>During my stay with Shizue, I learned a lot about the evolution system.</p><p><br></p><p>Still to think Gazel Dwargo would be <em>that</em> strong.</p><p><br></p><p>We reached the shop quickly and found the place in a mess.</p><p><br></p><p>Dwarves running around the place.</p><p><br></p><p>One of them saw us or rather saw Shizue and stopped.</p><p><br></p><p>“Miss Izawa, how rare of you to pay us a visit.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Garm. It’s nice to see you in good health. You people look lively. Is there a big order?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha yeah. We brothers got a big order and we partied but all of us got drunk and now we are late.” He scratched his head goofily when he said that.</p><p><br></p><p>Shizue giggled at the good natured dwarves.</p><p><br></p><p>“Please come in. And, who is this young man?”</p><p><br></p><p>“He is my new apprentice, Salvatore.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oho, the Conqueror of Flames has taken a new apprentice. That’s big news. Especially after the last two became such bigshots.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It was their own hard work and talent. I merely taught them some skills.” Shizue answered politely.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are as humble as always, Miss Izawa. So, what can we do for you today?” A brown bearded dwarf came forward and asked as he greeted Shizue.</p><p><br></p><p>“I wish to commission a sword for my apprentice. Something which might be more suited to his current strength.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, what level are we talking about?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sal is an Enlightened.” She answered quite casually.</p><p><br></p><p>The dwarves looked a bit shocked at the reveal and took another look at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“How’d ya make one so young? The brat doesn’t look a day over eighteen. How old are ya brat?” The dwarf went back to his accent due to the shock.</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm, I am sixteen, Sir.” I answered, amused.</p><p><br></p><p>“By my grandfather’s beard, what’d they feed you to get you to that level? Ah, don’t bother, none of my business. So, what kind of swords do you want?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Something that can resist the elemental attacks and bear magicules. I want the durability of the sword as the main priority.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, I think I know just the kind you want. Now, choose the shape of the sword.”</p><p><br></p><p>Shizue used an european style sword rather than a Japanese style one due to being taught by the Black Knight Claude, one of Leon Cromwell’s subordinates. Even Chorona used a similar sword. I was taught the same style and thus used the same.</p><p><br></p><p>I asked for the specifications to be made similar to Shizue’s sword, only with more weight and slightly bigger size for my physique.</p><p><br></p><p>“It will take a while, Miss Shizue. I just got consigned with making ingots for the Kingdom. A mighty big project. Tons of raw materials to be processed. I would like to start the work as soon as possible but it is a contract and I am bound. Moreover, the materials for the sword you want for the brat would take a long time to be refined as well.”</p><p><br></p><p>We unfortunately didn’t have that much time.</p><p><br></p><p>So I thought of something.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mr. Kajin, if I am not being rude, can I offer a suggestion?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmhh.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I can help you separate the materials from the ores. It would greatly speed up your work, right?”</p><p><br></p><p>He raised an eyebrow, looking quite amused. “Fancy yourself a blacksmith, do ya?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No no. How can I even think of such a thing? That would be insulting to the profession.” He looked pacified and nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I happen to possess a Skill which allows me to separate things. I am pretty sure I can separate the metal in the ores from the rock.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now that changed the man’s thoughts entirely. “A Skill, ya say? Show me.” He pointed me to the ores. The ores were stacked up in a big pile.</p><p><br></p><p>“Can I see what kind of metal is extracted from this ore?” I asked to know the feel of the metal before trying anything first.</p><p><br></p><p>The metal was a crimson coloured slab and was slightly hot to touch. According to Kajin, this is the quality of the metal and it can withstand extremely high temperatures which makes melting it nigh impossible and separating it even more.</p><p><br></p><p>I was thankful about having the Degenerate Skill at this moment,</p><p><br></p><p>The Skill worked as I designated the Metal to be separated from the rest of the ore. The Skill took a decent amount of power but I had more than enough for myself. The Degenerate Skill took care of the rest.</p><p><br></p><p>The ore and metal were completely separated. I did have to pay attention to not mix the things. I envy Rimuru so much right now for having Raphael.</p><p><br></p><p>Kajin took the metal dust and checked it closely. Then he ran several tests on it.</p><p><br></p><p>“One hundred percent. This metal is one hundred percent pure.”</p><p><br></p><p>The rest of the dwarves paused and then rushed towards him and began using their own methods to test it.</p><p><br></p><p>A full hour later, I was on the floor with Kajin shaking my shoulders. “How much do you want to refine metals for us?</p><p><br></p><p>“Mr. Kajin, calm yourself. I am not a blacksmith.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You can become one. I will teach you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Mr. Kajin, it’s not that I don’t respect Blacksmiths but this is not the job for me. I want something with my life and for that I need to travel and become stronger. I cannot achieve that as a Blacksmith. I apologise to you but I cannot accept your offer.” The man deflated so I added something. “I can however work temporarily for you and get all these metals separated or even mixed. You can pay me by making a sword for me. Just consider it a deal of sorts.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Deal.” he grabbed my hands and shook it.</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, why are you so excited about this? I am sure the metal ingots you refiled are almost the same purity.”</p><p><br></p><p>“They are not. The best metal I have refiled is of 98.5% purity. The metal that even the Royal Palace has refined till now, has never surpassed 99% purity. This….is a 100% pure metal. This type of thing has only been theorised before but never been seen. The last metal piece which was purified at 99.1% was made into a Legend Rank sword which is still wielded by the Royal Family. You see, the impurities make fault lines when magic flows in the metal because of the different magic carrying capacity of the different metals. And for this very reason, for every percent beyond 90, the price increases several times. Now, do you understand the importance of the purity of a metal?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Kinda. So, can you make me the sword we came here for?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously we will make you one. As long as you help us out with this metal, I will even throw in my best material to get you the finest sword we have ever crafted.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then we have a deal.”</p><p><br></p><p>We shook hands in confirmation.</p><p><br></p><p>What came afterwards was relentless work on my part. I worked for a whole day to get every metal, starting from the ores to the scrap metal separated.</p><p><br></p><p>Kajin also kept his side of the bargain and brought me to see the material.</p><p><br></p><p>“My grandfather and his brothers have gone out travelling the world several times and this is one of the things he had discovered. It was actually excavated with the help of a Spirit. One of those snort nosed Elf bastards was with them and lent them a hand while they cleared the physical obstacles. It is there that they discovered this beauty. It is a Titan’s bone. They were the predecessors of the Giants and were known in myths to rival even True Dragons’ powers.”</p><p><br></p><p>He opened a box and inside it was a while piece of bone. It looked normal.</p><p><br></p><p>Kajin seemed to have guessed my thought and said, “Touch it.”</p><p><br></p><p>I did and understood what he meant by the word beauty.</p><p><br></p><p>“It….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Still has insane amounts of energy. To be honest, we have tried to make a weapon out of this several times but the holy power inside the bones would flow in the metal and any fault would be exploited as the metal would be torn apart instantly. Now though, we can use the metal you purified to make a weapon out of this. You said something about being able to mix them too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then get to work. Show me how you do it first. We only get one chance at this one masterpiece.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure you want to give this to me? Isn’t this too….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Expensive? It is. Prolly would buy me half a small country but would have been impossible to make without your help. Moreover, you have no idea how much you have given me with those purified metal. I got a giant fortune for myself already. This is just me repaying a debt now. Now get to work. I won’t let ya waste this beauty of mine.”</p><p><br></p><p>He made me practise it on several metals till I got a hang of it and finally after a week of hard work and effort on all our parts, the masterpiece was created.</p><p><br></p><p>My sword was a simple looking one which didn’t radiate any power or anything. It’s just that when I used my magicules in it, the real magic was revealed. While flames of Holy Magic appeared blazing on the blade of the Sword.</p><p><br></p><p>“What will you name it?” Kajin asked me.</p><p><br></p><p>I thought of a sword with a similar background from my previous world and the name came out of my mouth automatically. “Lævateinn. In the world where I was summoned from, it is the name of the blade of the Fire Giant who could destroy the world. Flames which could burn the world.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm umm. Good name. Then Lævateinn it is.”</p><p><br></p><p>And thus I got my first personal weapon.</p><p><br></p><p>I got two other swords as well as a cover.</p><p><br></p><p>According to Kajin, the crafting of the Sword itself had given him an Extra Skill. It went to show how strong the sword was.</p><p><br></p><p>We took our leave soon after.</p><p><br></p><p>The Dwarven Capital was a good place but we had a journey to complete.</p><p><br></p><p>Shizue and I travelled for a while together and she taught and helped me wield my new sword.</p><p><br></p><p>And just like that, it was time for us to separate.</p><p><br></p><p>“Can’t I accompany you, Sensei?” I asked once more.</p><p><br></p><p>She got on her toes and patted my head. I grew a lot in the last few months due to my body becoming its peak from my evolution.</p><p><br></p><p>She shook her head. “This is something I need to take care of myself. But… I do have something to ask of you, will you do me a favour?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Anything.” I said.</p><p><br></p><p>She placed her hand on my cheek and smiled. “Can you meet my students in the Freedom Academy and find a way to help them? I was researching for a way to help them all and all I could find was having them make a contract with a spirit. This is a map for the Dwelling of Spirits where the Elemental Queen, Ramiris lives. If you can convince her and have them form contracts, I would be at peace. Can you do this for me, Sal?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I promise.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And I need a promise from you too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Live and take care of yourself, my foolish student.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm.” I felt a lump in my throat.</p><p><br></p><p>And that was the last time I saw my teacher.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Kajin -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Kajin used his new Extra Skill: Craftsman.</p><p><br></p><p>The job of beating the metal into shape had become an instinct to him and the metal itself bent to his will.</p><p><br></p><p>His Skill had increased his overall productivity and Skill level to a whole new level.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why did you lie to the brat, Kajin?”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at Garm who drank from his mug. “The brat wouldn’t have taken the sword if he knew.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Still….he now thinks that the sword was only a Legend Ranked one. That one gave me chills when I picked it up. Dare I say even the King’s sword wouldn’t be near that level.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It wasn’t. The sword was almost a God Ranked one. I used Magic Steel to bind the whole bone to the sword. I don’t think the sword would have been made without the boy’s power to mix the metal with the bone to form the core of the sword. I couldn’t have done it by myself. The brat worked alongside us, offering his blood and sweat in this workshop. He’s a brother to us and would I, Kajin, ever cheat a brother or harm him? The brat’s talent would give the sword its name. It’s not the sword that makes the wielder’s name but the wielder which makes the sword’s name. I talked to Shizue and she told me that the brat was summoned by one of those human nations….a slave. You and I know how that fate is.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Him?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. People like those begin to hate the world but he didn’t show the slightest resentment towards us and was polite. He fought through his fate of perishing and became an Enlightened in just two years. This is a gift from me to show him that our world is not all bad. I have no doubt that one day, he will surpass even the senior students under Shizue. Hero Hinata and Guildmaster Yuuki and become a Saint or even a Hero of the legends. And when he does so, I want a sword made by me by his side. The Lævateinn.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s a good dream.”</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: LuluViBritania(FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note: So, many people asked me if I had a Patreon.

The entire battlefield had calmed down in an instant.</p><p><br></p><p>One second it was all going well and then that… I gritted my teeth and took deep breaths, using Senjutsu to quickly calm my anger.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a close call.</p><p><br></p><p>A very close call.</p><p><br></p><p>If I hadn’t taken the Dimension Lost from Georg, Rias and Kuroka might have died.</p><p><br></p><p>If I hadn’t taken the Phenex Bloodline at such a high level, I would have most likely been seriously injured.</p><p><br></p><p>If there had been even a single step wrong then… and this was right after I had thought that I was finally someone who had a say in the world.</p><p><br></p><p>But I had no time to wallow in my thoughts right now.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the other fool who had come to attack this place with the bitch.</p><p><br></p><p>Creuserey Asmodeus was looking at me shocked but he wasn’t looking at me exactly….rather he was looking behind me.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact he was not the only one doing so.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone on the battlefield was looking at me or rather behind me in shock.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked behind me and saw the twelve wings of white flames flickering as if they were feathers. In fact the embers falling from the wings looked like white feathers. Is this how my wings look now?</p><p><br></p><p>I hadn’t seen them yet but they looked quite good.</p><p><br></p><p>“Twelve wings, that power….who are you?!” The Asmodeus shouted.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the idiot annoyed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ichigo Kurosaki….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t lie to me!”<br><br></p><p>“Oh! You caught me? Surprising….I didn’t expect an idiot like you to catch up. I guess the thing they say about old cats not being able to learn new tricks is not true after all.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Why! You carry the noble blood of a Satan in your veins, then why do you attack us?”</p><p><br></p><p>….does he still not understand why I attacked them?</p><p><br></p><p>Is he that blind.</p><p><br></p><p>“For those….” He pointed behind me. “Worthles….”</p><p><br></p><p>His words were not finished before I had swung my sword, sending another wave of Black Light towards him. The guy barely dodged but still lost a hand in the process.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh! I missed the mosquito again.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Kuroka -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She watched in awe as Sam stood in front of them like an ever healing, unbreakable wall, especially those twelve white wings of fire spread protectively in front of them, making him look even grander.</p><p><br></p><p>The power he was throwing around was beyond anything she had experienced from any devil.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Vali’s powers seemed like a candle flame compared to Sam.</p><p><br></p><p>She knew that Sam had some sort of power which he kept to himself.</p><p><br></p><p>They hadn’t pried too much into it as everyone was entitled to their own secrets but their guess was that it had something to do with the abnormal ritual and related to the soul of the dead which gave him all these power ups at random times.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, the growth this time was beyond all her expectations.</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t even notice it.</p><p><br></p><p>One moment that insane bitch was attacking them with Ophis’ power. The attack had made all the hair on her back stand and she was sure that she would have died had it hit them.</p><p><br></p><p>And at the very next moment, there was a barrier in front of them with Sam standing protectively in front of them with a sword drawn and wings out.</p><p><br></p><p>The barrier in front of them had been shaken while everything all around them was reduced to nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>She even witnessed Sam being almost blown apart but the very next moment, his body reformed back together.</p><p><br></p><p>The most terrifying part however was the fact that his power was still rising.</p><p><br></p><p>The foolish Asmodeus sensed it too and shouted. “You traitor, you dare attack us, the descendants of the True Satans for….for those girls?”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“I dare!” Sam whispered lightly but it was enough for everyone there to hear..</p><p><br></p><p>“Haha….hahahaha….Ahahahahahahahahaha….”</p><p><br></p><p>He started laughing and Kuroka noticed that his wings had taken a slightly darker shade.</p><p><br></p><p>His voice was quiet at first but slowly grew louder over time and even Kuroka felt chills on hearing it.</p><p><br></p><p>He suddenly became quiet.</p><p><br></p><p>“I dare, you ask?” He looked up towards the devil in the sky and asked. “Why wouldn’t I dare?”</p><p><br></p><p>He smiled mockingly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Katerea Leviathan attacked her so I killed <a href=\"https://her….in\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">her….in</a> one attack.”</p><p><br></p><p>Creuserey gritted his teeth.</p><p><br></p><p>“Had Tsufaame Tereaku Leviathan, attacked her….I would also have killed <a href=\"https://her….in\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">her….in</a> one attack.”</p><p><br></p><p>The whole battlefield had gone silent at his words, but he wasn’t done yet.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked directly into the now distorted face of Creuserey Asmodeus. “Had Leviathan herself attacked her….I would have done the same thing….killed <a href=\"https://her….in\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">her….in</a> one attack.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You traitor! Attack him!” Finally Creuserey couldn’t take it anymore and ordered his leftover people to attack and he himself attacked directly directly only for another flash of black light to flicker, leaving the bisected body of the Asmodeus descendant in the sky.</p><p><br></p><p>The entire army stopped in their tracks at the sight but Sam wasn’t done yet.</p><p><br></p><p>He raised a hand and several hundred magic circles were created, covering the entire sky and then with a slight movement of his finger, black light spears rained on the army.</p><p><br></p><p>Many of them created barriers and covered themselves but it was all for naught. The spears passed through the barriers as if they were nothing, ripping apart anyone who had come forward to attack him.</p><p><br></p><p>The single move calmed the whole battlefield down and Sam looked towards the remaining Old Satan supporters. “Anyone else wants to see what else I dare?”</p><p><br></p><p>No one spoke anything.</p><p><br></p><p>This was probably the first time she had seen Sam look so angry.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias got up and went past the barrier and hugged him from behind as his body stiffened for a moment and the rising power disappeared almost instantly and his wings regained their pristine white colour again.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sam….let’s go back….please.” She whispered soft enough that only the ones in the barrier could hear her.</p><p><br></p><p>He took in a deep breath and exhaled. “Okay.” He then turned towards the Leaders of the Three Factions who were looking at him as if he was some kind of a ghost.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally he turned towards Vali and asked. “I’m leaving. Those two fools completely ruined my mood to fight. Will you be staying?”</p><p><br></p><p>Vali looked at him for a moment and shook his head. “No. I have had enough….” he looked at the Red Dragon Emperor who was now breathing hard from exhaustion. “Disappointment for one day too.”</p><p><br></p><p>Vali landed beside him and he waved a hand, as the space around them wrapped, teleporting them away, leaving a stunned little Sona Sitri staring at them..</p><p><br></p><p>No one even moved from their places to stop them.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka looked around the place. “Where are we?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The barrier inside the school. We still need to take care of the Hero Faction after all. I left the place to get away from the eyes of the followers of those idiots.” He let out a sigh. “I feel so annoyed.” He then turned towards Vali. “Let’s go and beat up those Hero Faction clowns. I want to vent out for a bit.”</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka sweatdropped.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmph. I am not interested in bullying the weak.”</p><p><br></p><p>“There is always the fight with the Northern Gods.” She chimed in.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh. In that case, Kuroka.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes nyaa~”</p><p><br></p><p>“Can you put everyone inside to sleep?”</p><p><br></p><p>“That would be easy, nyaa~”</p><p><br></p><p>“But before that.” He pulled both Rias and her into a tight hug.</p><p><br></p><p>His smell had changed a bit and he felt warmer somehow….and it was not because of the flaming wings. She too wrapped her arms around him to enjoy the warmth.</p><p><br></p><p>They stayed like that for a minute before Vali broke the peaceful atmosphere. “Are you three done already?”</p><p><br></p><p>He pulled back and smiled at Vali, the same warm smile she was used to seeing him in. “Sorry for that.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Anyways, I am leaving. We still need to report to the Khaos Brigade.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That….I am sorry. It’s just that I lost control of myself for a moment there.” He bowed.</p><p><br></p><p>Vali snorted. “You shouldn’t apologise for every little thing. You are a Lucifer. Have some pride. As for those two fools. If you hadn’t killed them, I would have done it myself. They were the ones who made the first move. No one can blame us for what happened.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmph.” With that Vali teleported away, leaving the three of them there alone.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“You know, this is the first time I have seen your wings and they look beautiful. Is that why you were hiding it all this time?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Sam looked at Rias and then at her. “It’s a long story. My wings….and my power….they keep on changing.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh! Well that much was already obvious. Anyways, let’s knock them out first.” She pointed towards the barrier.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wait! I have a plan.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What plan?”</p><p><br></p><p>A devious smile formed on his face.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Serafall -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She hurried to Sona’s side as soon as those….people teleported away and checked to see if she was unhurt.</p><p><br></p><p>She had almost frozen everything in the area in a moment of rage when she saw Katerea attack Sona but then….</p><p><br></p><p>Even now she felt a chill down her spine when she recalled the moment.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are they alright?” Sirzechs came behind her and asked and she could sense the tension in his voice too.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, if she had been ready to freeze everything around her, Sirzechs had almost lost control and reverted to his True Form and that….would have been something far worse.</p><p><br></p><p>In a way, the boy’s intervention had averted a much greater disaster.</p><p><br></p><p>She felt pity for him because unlike her who could check on Sona, he couldn’t even see the condition Rias was in right now.</p><p><br></p><p>She lifted her head to see that Grayfia was checking on the other children and they had called out Asia Argento who was healing anyone who was injured.</p><p><br></p><p>The Angels and Fallen Angels were taking care of the leftovers who didn’t flee and stayed back to fight, not that that boy had left many to be cleared.</p><p><br></p><p>The barrier had also been destroyed by that first attack of his and the reinforcement were rushing in.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Most of them are only lightly injured. They are just deeply exhausted. They will be fine after a good rest.”</p><p><br></p><p>They took the children inside the main school building which was under barriers to bring them out of any danger.</p><p><br></p><p>Around half an hour later, the rest came in as well.</p><p><br></p><p>The Angels still had a shocked look on their faces and as she had expected, they directly turned to Sirzechs. “Sirzechs, just who….or what was he?”</p><p><br></p><p>The man in question though, himself looked just as surprised. “I….I don’t know.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What do you mean you don’t know? Didn’t you say that he was reincarnated by your sister?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Rias did inform me that she reincarnated him but she never told me anything else.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It was the power of Lucifer and the Phenex Clan. Do you think they were….?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs looked even more confused. “I….don’t know.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then why don’t you ask him? Call him. If they are in range, ask him who he is.” Azazel suggested.</p><p><br></p><p>“Although I am sure I have never met him before, for some reason, something about him felt… very familiar.” Gabriel said, making them turn towards her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Familiar….how?” Sirzechs asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Azazel was the one who answered instead. “The boy looked almost… Angelic. I thought I was hallucinating and it was a Great Seraph with his twelve wings, not to mention, he was wielding a Holy Sword. It took me a moment to realise it was the flames of the Phenex. And he’s a Lucifer. No wonder Vali was not speaking of him. The Demonic Brilliance of Evil Light... None of the Satan descendants had inherited the signature powers of their ancestors, and now one did and <em>that</em> of all things?”</p><p><br></p><p>Michael took the next turn to speak. “Sirzechs, can you please contact him?”</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs thought for a moment and nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>Grayfia handed him the phone that the guy had left and he dialled the number again. Surprisingly, the call connected.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hello, is this Samuel?” Sirzechs questioned.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>A moment later a voice came from the other side. “I-it’s me, Onii-sama.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs froze in his place and then, another moment later, he burst out in a flurry of questions. “Are you alright?  You didn’t get hurt in that attack, did you? Actually, you all have done enough, return home right now. We can manage the rest. There is no need to endanger your lives anymore.”</p><p><br></p><p>“....I am alright. No, I wasn’t hurt. Sam appeared right on time to help us. I….am sorry but this is something I need to do.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t need to do anything. You all have already made great contributions to the Underworld by the information you have revealed.” Sirzechs insisted.</p><p><br></p><p>“And that information is subject to change in several places….just like today. We cannot take any risk….please.”</p><p><br></p><p>Grayfia, in a rare moment of affection, stepped forward to place a hand on his shoulder and he let out a sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>“Just….take care of yourself.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>Michael took this moment to implore. “Sirzechs.” and the man in question nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Rias, is Samuel with you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“He….is doing something right now?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Will he be able to speak with us, possibly meet us for a while?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“....is he in any kind of trouble?” the voice on the other end asked, warily.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. Nothing of that sort.” It was Michael who spoke. “What he did today saved a lot of lives and made this Peace Conference a success. We were just….surprised and curious about him.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. He is back. You can talk to him.”</p><p><br></p><p>The voice on the other end changed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sam here.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hello, I am Sirzechs, Rias’ elder brother.” Sirzechs opened up. “I want to thank you for what you did today.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t need to. I didn’t exactly do it for you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But you still did us a great favour.” She added, standing up.</p><p><br></p><p>“....you are welcome.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Can you come and meet us?” He finally spoke.</p><p><br></p><p>“I know what you want to know but right now might be a bit problematic. I still have to take care of the Hero Faction and report back at the Khaos Brigade Headquarters. I mean, I kinda messed up their whole plan either way.  I will contact you in a week or two at best. Actually….is Archangel Michael there?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.” Michael replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“I….know what you all are thinking and I will explain everything when I am there but I have a request….or rather an offer if you are willing to consider.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What request?” Michael asked curiously.</p><p><br></p><p>“I….wish to see the Shroud of Turin.”</p><p><br></p><p>The eyes of everyone widened at his request but the boy continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry. I don’t want the Shroud. I just want to see it in person for a while. If you want, you can monitor me while I do so. I am not asking this for free either. In return for this and one more favour, I will offer Heaven, the True Longinus as payment.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Silence prevailed in the whole room.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone was stunned by his offer.</p><p><br></p><p>“You have the True Longinus!” Michael exclaimed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Just got my hands on it.”</p><p><br></p><p>Michael collected himself after his confirmation. “Very well, I promise you on behalf of Heaven that I will let you see the Shroud of Turin when we meet next time and complete your previous request regarding clearing the name of Asia Argento and Xenovia Quarta.” He promised solemnly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Great! Oh, and some friendly advice. Heaven’s System has a lot of loopholes and there are a bunch of Angels who are using this to avoid ‘Falling’. Currently, there are Pure Angels working with the Khaos Brigade.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What!”</p><p><br></p><p>“So it would be better if you kept anything I revealed to yourself and your close confidantes only.”</p><p><br></p><p>The Angels had fallen into a stunned silence.</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay, if there is nothing else, I will leave. I have a lot to do today.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sam!” Sirzechs spoke.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Please take care of Rias.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>With that the call was cut.</p><p><br></p><p>“So….we wait for him to contact us?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The boy is in a very dangerous situation, Azazel. Let him take his time. He is already doing more than we could ever ask for.” Micahel said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hey! I am not complaining. I just want to know when the time comes. I have many questions for him too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will contact everyone when he gives me a date.” Sirzechs spoke, a hint of firmness appearing on his face. “For now, we have to take care of things in our hands.”</p><p><br></p><p>The other leaders nodded at his statement.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Euclid Lucifuge -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“....and he killed both of them.” The man in front of him completed the report and Euclid had a frown on his face.</p><p><br></p><p>That boy….was a Lucifer?</p><p><br></p><p>But how?</p><p><br></p><p>He hadn’t heard of any Lucifers being born recently apart from Vali. So where did this guy come from? And he had the powers of those traitorous Phenex as well.</p><p><br></p><p>Did Razevan have a child with some Phenex?</p><p><br></p><p>“You may leave now.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man bowed and teleported away and he looked at the information they had gathered, which was practically nothing except his name and picture.</p><p><br></p><p>With another thought, he too got up and teleported away.</p><p><br></p><p>He reached his destination soon enough and directly walked towards the inner area and knocked on the door.</p><p><br></p><p>“Who?” A voice came from inside.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s Euclid, my Lord.” He bowed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Come in.”</p><p><br></p><p>He opened the door and entered, closing the door behind him.</p><p><br></p><p>“What brings you here, Euclid? I thought you were busy with your new group of friends, what’s their name? Ah, the Khaos Brigade.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I have just received a surprising piece of news.” He placed the file on the table in front of him. “Apparently there is a new Lucifer in the world.....and this one is a Super Devil too.”</p><p><br></p><p>The figure in front of him suddenly raised his head, looking at him and then picked up the file.</p><p><br></p><p>“Samuel White? A Lucifer? He doesn’t look like one.” He frowned. </p><p><br></p><p>“Around two hours ago, he killed Katerea and Creuserey….using the Demonic Brilliance of Evil Light….because they attacked a girl with him. He then proceeded to kill a large part of the army who were leading the attack on those fakes with a barrage of Black Light Spears.” Euclid reported.</p><p><br></p><p>The figure’s mouth opened. “Demonic Light! Are you sure?”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded and the figure in front of him smiled. “How surprising! Tell me everything.”</p><p><br></p><p>And he did.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahahahahahaha he threatened to kill aunty Leviathan if she had done the same….that’s so funny. Alright, I take back what I said before. This guy definitely has Lucifer blood. No other devil would have the balls to say such a thing….let alone in front of so many other devils.”</p><p><br></p><p>“My Lord, what should we do about him?”</p><p><br></p><p>“What else to do? I suddenly have a new family member out of nowhere, so obviously we need to meet him.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And about him killing Katerea and Creuserey?”</p><p><br></p><p>Lord Rizevim turned towards her. “What of it? Those fools got a bit of power from that dragon and bit off more than they could chew. At least, Creuserey should have thought better than to go after him when he revealed himself. If they died, it was their own fault.”</p><p><br></p><p>He bowed. ”As you say, My Lord.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, let’s leave unimportant things aside and go to your party house. I originally thought I only had my cute grandson but now I suddenly have another family member hahahaha. It’s time to celebrate.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Sam -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“What exactly is your plan?” Kuroka asked me while I was reinforcing the barrier around Cao Cao.</p><p><br></p><p>I also used my newly obtained Barrier Magic and Space Magic to assist me in the work. Finally, with a lot of power behind the wards, everything was done.</p><p><br></p><p>I had used all my skills to strengthen this barrier and considering how my Skills looked like now, it was seriously saying something.</p><p><br></p><p>This barrier would be able to withstand anything apart from a full powered Balance Breaker blow from the True Longinus and looking at Cao Cao’s skills, he is still far away from that level.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hold on for a bit.”</p><p><br></p><p>She did and soon I completed my work and turned towards the two girls behind me.</p><p><br></p><p>“The thing is….Cao Cao is working for Indra so if we fucked up, we could have one of the strongest Gods of the world, coming after us. And….”</p><p><br></p><p>“And?” She asked, raising an eyebrow at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Most of the normal members of Khaos Brigade were actually captured and brainwashed against their will, repeatedly thrown in dangerous situations and made to achieve Balance Breakers just so they could be used as tools. They didn’t even get a chance to choose. I kinda feel bad for them so this is also a chance for them. Without their Sacred Gears, they would be free to leave but if they decided to stay back then it is all on them.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So, we just let him go?” Kuroka asked, miffed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh no. <em>We</em> don’t <em>just</em> let them go.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then?”</p><p><br></p><p>Letting them go without letting them experience the actual dangers of such a life would only bring them back to this path. No. I needed to do something to make them afraid.</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled and explained my plan to them.</p><p><br></p><p>“You think it will work?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t see why not? As long as we do things properly, it would most definitely work.”</p><p><br></p><p>My plan was simple: we keep them locked up for a while and make it look as if they are captured by the Old Satan faction.</p><p><br></p><p>I will use all this time to copy all their abilities and remove their Sacred Gears and after I am done, the spell will frizzle out due to the deaths of Cureuserey and Katerea.</p><p><br></p><p>And since Katerea and Creuserey are already dead, who would know what they had done before dying?</p><p><br></p><p>The barriers were made so that they have a completely white interior and their sense of time will be messed up while they sleep inside.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, I just had to release them and have someone point these people to Shalba Beelzebub and let them tear each other apart.</p><p><br></p><p>Not that these idiots would be able to do anything without their Sacred Gears.</p><p><br></p><p>It’s just that….I am kinda worried about Indra poking his nose if all his people are <a href=\"https://dead….at\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">dead….at</a> least till I am at a level where he cannot do anything to me.</p><p><br></p><p>And just as we had discussed, we began putting everyone to sleep while pretending to be the Old Satan faction and safe to say that their reactions were hilarious.</p><p><br></p><p>“You all….traitors!” Georg growled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Shut up, filthy human. Be glad that your pathetic life can be of service to the True Satans.” I imitated Creuserey.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka wasn’t far behind and pulled a perfect Katerea.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did that cretin think he could strut around with that accursed stick of his, provoking and challenging us without any consequences?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Cao Cao would not let it go!” Georg shouted.</p><p><br></p><p>“That would happen when you get out of this alive. After today’s attack, I will personally take time to carve out your tongues for your imprudence.”</p><p><br></p><p>Hot damn!</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka was fucking killing it.</p><p><br></p><p>They attacked the barrier without any effects and Kuroka just laughed in Katerea’s voice before knocking them out with a simple use of magic.</p><p><br></p><p>Cao Cao was harder. The guy directly attacked the barrier and even used his pseudo-Balance Breaker but Kuroka’s poison was already affecting him and soon enough, he too fell.</p><p><br></p><p>The first thing I did was seal his magic and Sacred Gear.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are we done?” Kuroka asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I just want to do something here for a while. You guys can take a break if you want. This will take time.” With that said, I began copying a Skill I had been anticipating for a long time.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>S Ranked Sealing Magic</strong> from the True Longinus.</p><p><br></p><p>I was slightly broken between this and the A Ranked Bloodline of the Biblical God. </p><p><br></p><p>With the colour of the <strong>A Ranked ??? Bloodline</strong> Card I had, I was pretty sure that if I got the God’s bloodline, I would probably make it jump to S Rank immediately and the benefits from that would be immense but Sealing….</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully, the call with Michael gave me a way out.</p><p><br></p><p>The Shroud of Turin must also have the blood. Same with the Crown and the Goblet.</p><p><br></p><p>So there were other sources from which I could get the bloodline.</p><p><br></p><p>But I doubt if the other Skills were available from other sources.</p><p><br></p><p>Secondly, I needed the Sealing Skill for various uses, like separating the Sacred Gears from the users.</p><p><br></p><p>I had copied Cao Cao’s skill already so I had no way of removing the Spear without killing him… unless I had the S Ranked Sealing Magic Skill.</p><p><br></p><p>There were also those Malebranche which needed to be sealed.</p><p><br></p><p>And if I had an opportunity, I would probably go inside Trihexa’s seal and throw a bunch of new seals to surprise anyone idiot enough to try and free it.</p><p><br></p><p>Let them experience the horrors of an S Ranked Skill.</p><p><br></p><p>Most importantly, it would give me a sort of protection from my greatest fear in this world… being sealed.</p><p><br></p><p>The fact that I would get access to Trihexa and might be able to copy its skill was also a plus.</p><p><br></p><p>This skill was just too good to let go.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka didn’t say anything while Rias already knew everything and both of them sat on either side of me, resting their heads on my shoulder.</p><p><br></p><p>I wrapped my arms around the two girls and relaxed.</p><p><br></p><p>She left after a few hours to confirm who Koneko was. They already had an arrangement for the entire meeting.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, only Rias and I were left there.</p><p><br></p><p>I set a small barrier around us to give us privacy and she sensed it, hugging me tightly. I held her and laid down on the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>“I’m….” She began to speak.</p><p><br></p><p>“I swear, if you apologise to me one more time, I will get angry.” I scolded, making her quiet. “It was a battle, anything could happen. If anything, I am the one who should have been more careful and not stick to my….future knowledge. I have already seen many places where they were different.”</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t say anything. I took this chance to caress her hair and place a light kiss on her forehead.</p><p><br></p><p>“Rias.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I think I have an idea about the Skill I want to give you.” I spoke softly.</p><p><br></p><p>She paused for a second and I explained further.</p><p><br></p><p>“I was able to copy many skills today and one of the best was the one I copied from Sirzechs.”</p><p><br></p><p>I explained to her the effects of the Demonic Mutation Card.</p><p><br></p><p>“I couldn’t control which Bloodline it will latch onto and you will not become strong immediately but….you will get a big boost in your strength. Although you will have to train more to fully develop the abilities. It will just increase your ceiling, your upper limit. So….what do you say?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay.” She whispered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Great.” I kissed her forehead once again and snuggled with her.</p><p><br></p><p>Today had been extremely hectic and I was feeling sleepy right now.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>When I woke up, I found myself in Rias’ lap. She was still awake.</p><p><br></p><p>“You didn’t sleep?”</p><p><br></p><p>She shook her head and caressed my hair. “I was not sleepy.”</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t say anything and decided to enjoy her lap pillow.</p><p><br></p><p>The Skill had been copied.</p><p><br></p><p>My second S Ranked Skill and the first actively usable S Ranked Skill.</p><p><br></p><p>My mind was already full of extremely large amounts of information about a variety of Sealing Magic Spells….even the ones used to make Sacred Gears.</p><p><br></p><p>The funny thing was that even with my current power, I wouldn’t be able to use these skills to their full potential.</p><p><br></p><p>I needed more raw power for that.</p><p><br></p><p>“Has Kuroka returned?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, she went back home to talk to Xenovia. I told her that we will move the Hero Faction members to somewhere else and then return and she agreed. Vali in the meanwhile went back to report to the Khaos Brigade Headquarters. We need to go there tomorrow.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see.” I nodded. This much was expected. “Alright, then let’s transfer these fools away from this place.”</p><p><br></p><p>And I did just that.</p><p><br></p><p>It took us around twelve hours to remove the Sacred Gears from all those people. Seriously, I was not regretting getting the Sealing Skill in the least.</p><p><br></p><p>They were all teleported to an island in Japan which had been uninhabited for decades. It wasn’t that difficult with my Space Magic and the Dimension Lost.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, with everything done, I took Rias and teleported away to our home.</p><p><br></p><p>It was already midnight. Kuroka and Xenovia were still awake, probably waiting for us.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is everything done?” Kuroka was the first one to ask.</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded in confirmation. Turning towards Xenovia, I summoned the Durandal and handed it to her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thanks. This was a big help.” I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. This was the least I could do since I couldn’t go there to help.” She spoke stoically but I could sense the frustration in her voice.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry. You will get your chance soon. Just keep on training.” I patted her shoulder.</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka brought out some takeouts which she had prepared beforehand for us since I couldn’t cook today.</p><p><br></p><p>“You both go and get cleaned up. I will set the table.” She looked quite cheerful today.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, my Senjutsu was also sensing her happiness.</p><p><br></p><p>Meeting her sister and making up with her had helped her mind and mood a lot.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thanks Kuroka.”</p><p><br></p><p>Both Rias and I went to our room and undressed, directly going to the bath.</p><p><br></p><p>It has become a habit for us.</p><p><br></p><p>But unlike usual, today, she sat on my lap, facing me, my shaft directly on her snatch.</p><p><br></p><p>I raised an eyebrow but she was already in action. She reached my face, caressed my cheeks and then approached me, placing a kiss on my lips.</p><p><br></p><p>A soft kiss with no tongue, just feeling my lips.</p><p><br></p><p>My hands went around her waist as I let her do what she wanted.</p><p><br></p><p>She soon separated and smiled and handed me something.</p><p><br></p><p>Hair colour remover.</p><p><br></p><p>My face lit up.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at her and smiled. She had already figured out that I absolutely loved her crimson hair.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t wait another moment as I washed away the black magical dye from her head, revealing her glorious crimson locks.</p><p><br></p><p>In the meanwhile, she took some soap in her hand, washed my chest, shoulders and then went to my arms.</p><p><br></p><p>Taking a bath with her was never about sex but the whole act always felt very intimate to us.</p><p><br></p><p>She then sat on the side of the bathtub and spread her leg slightly. I raised an eyebrow at her and she blushed.</p><p><br></p><p>“I-it’s not that. Turn around. I will wash your hair too.” She was completely red.</p><p><br></p><p>I chuckled and did just that.</p><p><br></p><p>The position however was doing crazy things to me. The softness of her thighs and the warmth of her core while she massaged my hair with shampoo, all this while in a warm bath after a long and tiring day….I did the only thing any reasonable man would do.</p><p><br></p><p>Relaxed and enjoyed the moment.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sam.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you for being in my life.”</p><p><br></p><p>I opened my eyes slightly and saw her reflection in the mirror. Her face had an adoring look with a hint of sadness as well. Meeting with her peerage members and seeing her brother after so long must have reminded her of many things. I didn’t want her to think about any depressing thoughts right now so I took her hand in mine.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ditto.”</p><p><br></p><p>“....”</p><p><br></p><p>“Really! Ditto?” She smiled and shook her head, her sombre look dissipating with that smile of hers.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yup. Thank you for being in my life too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But….ditto….”</p><p><br></p><p>“I thought it sounded cool.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It didn’t!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Aye aye Captain.” I saluted.</p><p><br></p><p>“Pfft….” She finally cracked and both of us burst out in laughter.</p><p><br></p><p>The atmosphere lightened up again.</p><p><br></p><p>We got ready and went for dinner. Kuroka had been waiting for a long time.</p><p><br></p><p>The rest of the gang had arrived there as well.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you both alright?” Ley Fey asked, worried.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright? Didn’t you hear? Sammy here, soloed the whole Old Satan faction. Damn, I should have gone there too.” Bikou jumped excitedly.</p><p><br></p><p>“I heard that you cut through the barrier and even the clouds?” Arthur asked, interested.</p><p><br></p><p>Vali didn’t say anything but he was also looking at me.</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled and answered their questions one by one.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, I am alright.” I patted Ley Fey’s head and turned towards the other two. “I kinda lost my temper for a bit, the rest kinda just happened. Cutting the barrier and clouds was mainly due to the Lucifer Clan Trait and Durandal. It has the property to cut through anything or something like that.”</p><p><br></p><p>Arthur nodded in understanding while Bikou was still jumping around excitedly.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka came out of the kitchen at that time, carrying a bowl in her hands.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, both of you are out already? That was quick. I thought you both would take a while longer doing….nyaa~” Kuroka smirked at us.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias blushed lightly but she was getting used to it while I chuckled. “I need energy for that and so dinner comes first, right love?” I turned towards Rias who was not expecting this and spluttered for words, making both Kuroka and me laugh.</p><p><br></p><p>She understood that we were teasing her and just pouted.</p><p><br></p><p>In the meanwhile, Xenovia was listening to our conversation intently as if taking notes….and knowing her, she might be doing just that.</p><p><br></p><p>We finished our dinner and sat around to talk about the events of today.</p><p><br></p><p>“So….would you like to tell us something?” Vali asked, breaking the conversation.</p><p><br></p><p>I knew what he was asking.</p><p><br></p><p>We had already discussed an excuse for my weird powers knowing that this day was coming sooner or later and that was the botched up ritual doing something to my soul.</p><p><br></p><p>“My condition….you are all more or less aware of it. My powers….are not something that I learned but more like to remember and get used to. It’s like I get all the memories and the more I practise, the more I learn. It has always been like that and even I am trying to figure out the particularities of this power. It could be due to the whole ritual but I am not sure about that. I have figured something out about my powers, just a part of it.” I looked at Vali. “It allows me to get used to someone’s soul or aura and maybe copy their <a href=\"https://power….at\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">power….at</a> least that’s what I think it is.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Copy Powers? How?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t know. It doesn’t always work. It could be more like awakening something I already had in me because to create me, apart from Lucifer’s blood, several others were used. Unfortunately the documents were destroyed so we don’t know exactly what they were. But I personally think my soul can get used to the….how do I explain this….frequency of other people’s souls and imitate their power. And even then I cannot copy any and all kinds of power. One in a hundred souls could be compatible with me.” I explained while keeping things vague.</p><p><br></p><p>“Can you show us how?”Ley Fey asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm….how do I do that?” I had already copied everything from them.</p><p><br></p><p>Alright, let’s pretend.</p><p><br></p><p>“Vali.”</p><p><br></p><p>The guy raised an eyebrow at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Can you summon your Sacred Gear?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t speak but did it nonetheless.</p><p><br></p><p>Two blue and white wings appeared behind him.</p><p><br></p><p>I stepped forward. “May I?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked confused but nodded nonetheless.</p><p><br></p><p>I touched the wings and down in a meditative position. “This will take a few hours.”</p><p><br></p><p>“How long?” He asked me.</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t know, I have never tried this on anyone as strong as Albion. Maybe four….or five hours. You will need to sit here.”</p><p><br></p><p>They were interested and so was Albion and they did sit there quietly, although Bikou looked like he was having a hard time doing so.</p><p><br></p><p>Around five hours later, I breathed heavily and stood up with sweat on my forehead, an easy feat for someone who had a high enough Senjutsu level as me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is it done?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded and touched his shoulder. ‘<em>Divide</em>’</p><p><br></p><p>My A Ranked Divide worked exactly as I wanted it to and I felt a good amount of Demonic Power flow into me as Vali’s eyes widened.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“That’s impossible.”</em> Albion’s voice sounded from his wings.</p><p><br></p><p>“And yet I can do this. There are many things I still need to figure out about this power like its limits as in how many powers I can accommodate or how long I can use them. And till now I only know that I cannot copy anyone a lot stronger than me or I go poof. Not that anyone strong enough would hold hands with me and sit there for hours straight for me to test. And all of this would come after I find someone compatible.” I laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>They looked in thought. Even Albion was silent.</p><p><br></p><p>“How did you know you could copy Albion’s power?” Vali asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mostly a guess.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A guess?” He looked unconvinced.</p><p><br></p><p>I sighed and explained more. “My power is in a sense similar to Albion’s Divide as it takes powers from others and makes it my own. This is why I thought I could possibly copy his powers. And I was surprisingly correct. But even then I got only his Divide while I sensed several other powers inside him.”</p><p><br></p><p><em>“My Divide alone can make the world tremble. Since you are the only one apart from me who can use it, make sure you train it to the peak. Do not sully my name.”</em> Albion spoke.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will make sure I do justice to your power.”</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, I turned towards the rest. “So what now?”</p><p><br></p><p>The crowd burst out suddenly.</p><p><br></p><p>“That was amazing!” Ley Fey cheered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wow, that really surprised me.” Bikou jumped excitedly.</p><p><br></p><p>“It is an incredible power.” Arthur nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“I didn’t understand everything but it seems like a very good power. To even get the power of the White Dragon Emperor.” Xenovia nodded to herself as if she had discovered something great.</p><p><br></p><p>“The White Dragon Emperor’s Power is far beyond just Divide but thank you for your praise.” I shook my head.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wait! Is that why you were out with the Hero Faction idiots?” Kuroka suddenly asked me, gaining everyone’s attention.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yup. I was trying to see if I could get any powers useful to me….and you all wouldn’t believe what I got.”</p><p><br></p><p>“New magic!”</p><p><br></p><p>I lifted my hand and a grey mist came out of it.</p><p><br></p><p>Their mouths hung open. “So you were doing that by yourself, not using the Dimension Lost?” Kuroka asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yup. How do you think I controlled the barrier? Although I was only able to get the Space Magic from it.”</p><p><br></p><p>By now everyone was interested. Even Vali. “What else did you get?”</p><p><br></p><p>I gave them a smile and walked to the other side of the room….and summoned the True Longinus, still sealed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Guess what? Someone wouldn’t be able to wave around their big stick to overcompensate anymore.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Wow!”</p><p><br></p><p>I stored the Spear away. “Imagine my surprise when I found out that the greatest weapon against any devil was the most compatible with someone like me, who was made from the blood of the Devil himself….then again, they were Father and Son after all, so in hindsight, it makes perfect sense.”</p><p><br></p><p>They were still blankly staring at me.</p><p><br></p><p>Xenovia was the strangest one. She walked up to me and fell to her knees.</p><p><br></p><p>I was taken aback by her behaviour and quickly picked her up. “What the hell are you doing?”</p><p><br></p><p>“You….you got the approval….blessing…..power God.” The tone of absolute reverence in her voice actually scared me.</p><p><br></p><p>This bull headed girl….just what in the world was she thinking?</p><p><br></p><p>“It was more of me using my power.” I tried to explain but she wasn’t taking any of that.</p><p><br></p><p>“But yet you got the acceptance of the Divine Will which means he has accepted you and decided to bestow his powers on you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright alright, enough of this. I have made a deal with Archangel Michael to offer this to Heaven in return for a few things which we will need. Do any of you want to do anything with the spear?”</p><p><br></p><p>None of them wanted anything.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. That’s that then. I have several Sacred Gears on me though. The Hero Faction is clean now. So if any of you want any, you can tell me. I will give you all a list.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Albion is enough for me.” Vali denied.</p><p><br></p><p>“My Ruyi Jingu Bang suits me the best.” Bikou was unmoved.</p><p><br></p><p>“Caliburn is good enough for me but thank you for the offer.” Arthur said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Really? I thought you could use a Blade Blacksmith.”</p><p><br></p><p>He shook his head. “Any sword made from a Blade Blacksmith won’t be Caliburn’s match.”</p><p><br></p><p>True.</p><p><br></p><p>“I-I like magic more. But thank you.” Ley Fey bowed.</p><p><br></p><p>“In that case I will keep the rest for trades.”</p><p><br></p><p>No one had any problems with it.</p><p><br></p><p>We talked about some more things.</p><p><br></p><p>It was decided that we were going to have a fight with some Northern Gods soon after tomorrow’s Khaos Brigade meeting.</p><p><br></p><p>And after I had a meeting with the Leaders of the Three faction, we would go to Romania.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t want to go there until I was used to my new powers.</p><p><br></p><p>From what I remembered, Rizevim and Crom Crauch had been there in the story.</p><p><br></p><p>I was nowhere nearly as strong to take them on.</p><p><br></p><p>Now if I could only get some peace and alone time with Ophis….</p><p><br></p><p>For now, I decided to hide the Sacred Gears so that we are not doubted.</p><p><br></p><p>It was morning by the time everyone went back to their homes.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka and Xenovia were tired too and they went to bed soon after, leaving Rias and me alone.</p><p><br></p><p>We looked at each other but didn’t go back to our room but rather proceeded to the basement training room.</p><p><br></p><p>I used my newly acquired Barrier Skill to make a strong barrier around the room and then looked at Rias. “You ready?”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s sit. This will take a while.”</p><p><br></p><p>I opened my Skill List and checked everything.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>S Ranked Luck</strong></p><p><strong>S Ranked Sealing Magic</strong></p><p><strong>A Ranked Severing</strong></p><p><strong>A Ranked Cutting</strong></p><p><strong>A Ranked Space Magic</strong></p><p><strong>A Ranked Holy Demonic Magic</strong></p><p><strong>A Ranked Demonic Mutation</strong></p><p><strong>A Ranked Divide</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>A Ranked ???

Several of the existing Skills were on the verge of Ranking Up.</p><p><br></p><p>I took a seat on the couch and she came to my arms and I used the Gift option.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>A Ranked Demonic Mutation</strong> Card.</p><p><br></p><p>The first thing which happened was my Belphegor Bloodline slipping back to C Rank, not that it made too much of a difference.</p><p><br></p><p>I was still comfortably in A Rank with my Unnamed Bloodline Card which was supposedly even above Sirzechs’ Bael Bloodline. My Demonic Power will keep on rising the more I train. Not to mention after copying God’s Bloodline.</p><p><br></p><p>“How do you feel? Are there any problems, discomfort?”</p><p><br></p><p>She shook her head.</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay.”</p><p><br></p><p>We didn’t talk much and just stayed in each other’s arms, waiting for the completion of the process.</p><p><br></p><p>I moved when there were only five minutes left for the process to end.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. Let’s get ready.”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded and stepped in the open, not increasing the distance between us by a lot.</p><p><br></p><p>We were worried about her changing into something similar to Sirzechs’ True Form in which case being so close to her would have been dangerous.</p><p><br></p><p>Minutes turned to seconds and finally the last seconds ticked away.</p><p><br></p><p>I waited ready in case she lost control but that moment never came.</p><p><br></p><p>Three hours had passed.</p><p><br></p><p>And then I sensed it.</p><p><br></p><p>Her Demonic Power fluctuated slightly before bursting out in a hurricane.</p><p><br></p><p>I was already prepared and even threw in a few spells I had gained from the true Longinus to further reinforce the Barrier.</p><p><br></p><p>Her power kept on increasing and I took a chance to check her cards.</p><p><br></p><p>Surprisingly, it wasn’t her Bael Bloodline which the card was attached to but rather her Gremory Bloodline, directly turning it into a high level B Ranked Card.</p><p><br></p><p>Her demonic power’s rise finally stopped in the B Rank too.</p><p><br></p><p>With enough work, she would be able to turn them into A Ranked Cards.</p><p><br></p><p>The most surprising change however was her Luck Card.</p><p><br></p><p>It had changed from the original C Ranked Card to a new B Ranked Card.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly, she collapsed on her knees and stared at her hands with a shocked expression on her face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is something wrong?” I asked worriedly.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at me. “You….can’t see this?”</p><p><br></p><p>“What?” I asked, trying to take a look at her hand again.</p><p><br></p><p>“This….aura around my hand?”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at her hand once more, even used Senjutsu and other magic but found nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. It looks the same to me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s….” Suddenly as if she had an idea, she summoned a Dice from somewhere and looked at it. A moment later, she rolled it and saw a result.</p><p><br></p><p>As if understanding something, she summoned several other dice, over a dozen of them and then looked at me. “Tell me a number.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Mmh five.”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded and passed the dice to me. “Roll them.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded and went on with her experiment. Twenty dices rolled at the same time from my hands and….all of them turned to the same face….five.</p><p><br></p><p>I understood what she was trying to do.</p><p><br></p><p>“This….is luck. Sam….I can see luck.” She looked around at things, narrowing her eyes, still getting used to it. “Everything has luck. I just have to concentrate on anything to see its aura and then I can manipulate it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Really!” That sounded awesome. “How do I look?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean….I did have an S Ranked Luck.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at me and narrowed her eyes, suddenly shutting her eyes back again, her face snapping to the other direction.</p><p><br></p><p>“Rias!”</p><p><br></p><p>She raised her hand and then slowly looked at me, her eyes widening as she stared at me, slowly coming forward and touching my cheek.<br><br></p><p>“Sam….your luck….it’s….blinding. It was as if seeing the sunlight directly after staying in a dark room. It’s….Amazing!”</p><p><br></p><p>She caressed my cheek.</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t feel any discomfort, do you?”</p><p><br></p><p>She shook her head. “No. I can feel my increased power but it dances to my will. Then again, Onii-sama had always had exceptional control over his Power of Destruction.” She explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“So you can manipulate luck now? How does it work?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s hard to explain. I will need to work on it to figure it out.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then we do that slowly. You need to rest now. We have been working for the last two days without any rest.” I said and she smiled at me, walking over to me and hugging me. I, understanding what she wanted, leaned in and touched her lips with mine.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, she will be able to protect herself to a certain degree in this world.</p><p><br></p><p>As for what happens in the future, we just have to work hard to prepare for it.</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><a href=\"https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am back with another chapter of Skillful Reincarnation.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sam got pissed off and scared the crap out of the leaders of the Three Factions.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The Old Satan faction is now half down all because of a mosquito.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Rizevim is coming out of his self imposed exile.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The Hero Faction has been neutered and they don’t even know who did it.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sam kinda opened up on his powers in front of everyone to avoid their mistrust.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>And finally, Rias got a new powerup.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Wonder how the Gremory Family will react to their actual Clan Trait?</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I mean, one can fight the Power of Destruction but how will someone fight Luck?</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>In the next few chapters I will try to explore other factions a bit maybe.

I felt a massive change in my body. My location and situation however didn't permit me to check those changes properly.</p><p><br></p><p>I could only see the cards merge and form something completely unexpected.</p><p><br></p><p>My Lucifer Bloodline changed completely.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>A Ranked ??? Bloodline</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The colour of the card was far darker than that of even Sirzechs which meant it was stronger than even Sirzechs' Bael Bloodline.</p><p><br></p><p>It was so strange that even the System didn’t have a name for it. I guess I am thankful it doesn’t say Biblical Cocktail as the Bloodline name.</p><p><br></p><p>And with the change in Bloodline came a massive increase in my Demonic Power. It was soaring at every moment.</p><p><br></p><p>It was already in the mid levels of B Rank and was now climbing up at an insane rate,</p><p><br></p><p>But those were not the only ones.</p><p><br></p><p>Swordsmanship and Senjutsu from Vasco and Tobio were copied too, pushing my own Swordsmanship to higher levels of B Rank for both.</p><p><br></p><p>The only ones left were the A Ranked Skills.</p><p><br></p><p>Apart from the ones I was copying from others, I started a copy on another one of my own.</p><p><br></p><p>The Dimension Lost’s A Ranked Space Magic.</p><p><br></p><p>My Skills were rising at an extremely fast rate.</p><p><br></p><p>Especially the ones related to my Bloodlines.</p><p><br></p><p>The Holy and Light Magic Skills had jumped up to B Rank, almost on the verge of breaking through the next Rank. Same with the Light and Holy Resistance.</p><p><br></p><p>My Holy Demonic Magic on the other hand had jumped up to an outrageous A Rank.</p><p><br></p><p>But this was not the end. No, it was not even close.</p><p><br></p><p>The time felt as if passing by at snail’s pace.</p><p><br></p><p>With my control over the barrier I could feel that Georg and Leonardo had awakened but were trapped with the magicians.</p><p><br></p><p>Cao Cao was still waiting for the signal. Not that he would be able to do anything. This barrier was made to stop the likes of Sirzechs. Cao Cao was just not on that level.</p><p><br></p><p>I took the time to meditate and use my new Senjutsu to calm myself and prepare my mind for the upcoming fight.</p><p><br></p><p>The range of my sensing was covering the whole room and I could feel the whole school. Rias and Kuroka were in the Old School Building and they were with the other members of her peerage as well as two other strong auras.</p><p><br></p><p>It didn’t seem like they were fighting.</p><p><br></p><p>Worried, I called her first, just in case I was worrying unnecessarily.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you both need help?” I asked, without talking about anything unnecessary.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. Continue what you are doing. We… were identified by Koneko.”</p><p><br></p><p>… we forgot about the smell.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh.” I replied blankly at our dumb oversight. “If you want then you can wait for around two more hours. I trapped Cao Cao. Georg, Leonardo and basically the entire Hero Faction as well as the Magicians, even stole the Dimension Lost and Annihilation Maker. They will be trapped till I let them go.”</p><p><br></p><p>“How long till you are done?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Two hours. Then I will give the signal. If you want then you can inform your brother. I even left a mobile in the wall, under the right hand corner of the main window of the Principal’s room. It can connect to my own if he wants to talk.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay. I will send Souji and Beowulf to inform Onii-sama about it.” She replied.</p><p><br></p><p>I understood her meaning. She was sending them there to give me a chance to copy their Skills.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sam…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Be careful.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will. You do too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p><br></p><p>And sure enough, I felt two people move to the Principal’s office from the Old School building. Their cards appeared in front of me as soon as they entered my range.</p><p><br></p><p>I took a quick look at their Skills and without any delay, started to copy their B Ranked Swordsmanship Skill Cards.</p><p><br></p><p>One was the sole Knight of Sirzechs, someone who took a Super Devil like him two knight pieces to reincarnate, the strongest Knight of the Underworld. His skills as a swordsman are no less than Vasco Strada. Beowulf was similar and although not at the level of Souji, he was still a master swordsman.</p><p><br></p><p>The best part was that each of them had a completely different Swordsmanship style than what I had been using. Which meant a greater increase in my skills.</p><p><br></p><p>Just as I was waiting, the mobile rang.</p><p><br></p><p>The number was the one which I had left in the Principal’s office.</p><p><br></p><p>I took a deep breath and picked up the phone.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Sirzechs -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>This day was turning out to be a massive roller coaster of emotions.</p><p><br></p><p>He had been extremely busy solving the issues which were predicted by Rias’ new pawn. In fact, some of the information helped them bring all three Abrahamic factions together.</p><p><br></p><p>Michael and Azazel were willing to listen. Obviously he had to prove the veracity of his source of information as well as the danger the Khaos Brigade were posing.</p><p><br></p><p>They had already been looking for a chance to sign a Peace Treaty and now with Kokabiel’s attack as a trigger, they even had a reason.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the reasons why Azazel didn’t do anything to stop him when he was carrying out his plans and even Michael, reduced the guard on the Excalibur swords so that they could steal it easily. On the plus side, it helped them discover the traitors among their ranks who were siding with Kokabiel. Needless to say, they were purged.</p><p><br></p><p>He wondered how Kokabiell would feel if he knew that the swords he stole were embedded with spells to monitor him. All his actions, each and every one of his associates were discovered if he made contact with them even once after stealing the sword. The Alchemists of Heaven and Azazel made sure the spell seemed like a part of the Sword’s magic instead of a surveillance spell.</p><p><br></p><p>WIth Ajuka’s help, Kokabiel had no chance of ever discovering anything.</p><p><br></p><p>He had then revealed the plan of attack on the Peace Conference by the Khaos Brigade and the attackers involved.</p><p><br></p><p>Three of the Top Four Longinuses were on the other side. Not to mention the people from the Old Satan faction blessed with Ophis' snakes willing to go as far as self-destruct to take them down.</p><p><br></p><p>And yet, everyone had come here, despite knowing the dangers for the sake of Peace between the Three Biblical Factions.</p><p><br></p><p>His thoughts were broken by the knock on the door.</p><p><br></p><p>\"May we enter, Sir?\" He heard Souji's voice.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Enter.\" He ordered.</p><p><br></p><p>Both Souji and Beowulf entered.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Is everything done there?\" He asked. He had stationed his Peerage members to protect Gasper.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Yes. The attackers were subdued. It's just that…\" Beowulf hesitated.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Ojou-sama and Koneko-kun's sister are here.\"</p><p><br></p><p>He stopped himself from getting up and going there right now to bring her back home.</p><p><br></p><p>As much as he would like to do it, what she was doing there was extremely important for the future of their entire race. He, as a Satan, can't do so even if he wanted to.</p><p><br></p><p>\"How is the situation on their side?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"She said that there is a mobile in the wall, under the right hand corner of the main window of the Principal’s room.\"</p><p><br></p><p>He raised an eyebrow. Grayfia used a magic circle and cleaved the wall cleanly. Sure enough, there was a mobile in there.</p><p><br></p><p>\"It was left there by her pawn and we can talk to him if we want to. She said that he has been dealing with the attackers before they began attacking.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Are we talking about the mysterious seer you told us about?” Azazel enquired.</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded in reply as he called the number.</p><p><br></p><p>It rang twice before the call was picked up. </p><p><br></p><p>\"Is this Samuel?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"<em>Yes. Just call me Sam. Am I talking to Rias' elder brother?</em>\" A young male voice sounded from the other side.</p><p><br></p><p>His lips twitched slightly at the question. It was the first time someone had addressed him as Rias' brother and not Satan Lucifer.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Yes.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"<em>Alright. The users of Dimension Lost and Annihilation Maker have been subdued. The barrier is currently under my control. I have trapped the True Longinus user as well as several Sacred Gear users and Magicians in their own barrier. Need around an hour and a half before the signal for attack comes. </em>\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"What?\" He asked, failing to register the words for a moment.</p><p><br></p><p>\"<em>The Sacred Gear users and Magicians have been trapped and the barrier is under my control. Among the Longinus users, two have been subdued while True Longinus user is trapped. When the attack starts, I will inform you before time. At that time, I will throw in some of them to draw in the real targets, the Old Satan faction.</em>\"</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. Apparently he didn't hear wrong because everyone in the room heard the same and had similar looks on their faces.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Where are you?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"<em>I am under a barrier on the school premises.</em>\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Can you come here without attracting any attention?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"<em>It could be risky.</em>\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"No need to risk anything. Although, we would like to meet you sometime if possible.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"<em>... alright. By the way, would anyone be interested in some Sacred Gears? We kinda need a few things and would like to trade a few of them off.</em>\"</p><p><br></p><p>Trade?</p><p><br></p><p>\"Have you extracted them?\" Michael asked, listening to the offer.</p><p><br></p><p>\"<em>None of them were hurt. If that's what you are worried about.</em>\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Interesting. How did you manage to do that?\" Azazel asked.</p><p><br></p><p>\"<em>I have my ways. Are you interested in the trade?</em>\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Sure, why not.” Azazel replied, looking amused.</p><p><br></p><p>All this time, he was wondering what was going on with the whole situation. How did a call to judge the severity of the attack turn into a trade for Sacred Gears?</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Well, I currently have a buffet in front of me. Dreamlike Curse, Aegis Mineralisation, Night Reflection as well as a few.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>“And what do you want in return?”</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Swords. Holy or Demonic named swords, more specifically Arondight which is with the Fallen Angels and… the spear in your pocket for Asia Argento.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>A Spear?</p><p><br></p><p>He saw a look of surprise on Azazel’s face.</p><p><br></p><p>“You really have a great appetite, don’t you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>I am just asking for a fair deal.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>“And you think it’s a fair deal?”</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Your spear, while good, will disintegrate after one use. If it’s merged with Asia’s Twilight Healing though, it will not only gain stability but also enable her to heal anything within a certain area. She gets a means to protect herself and you get enough data to make stable Sacred Gears. Yes. It is a fair deal.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>“And you think the resident of the spear will agree?”</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>...you do realise that you all are gathered here because of the things I know. And yet you question my words? Sigh Asia is a natural born Dragon Tamer. Her natural talent is so high that she can even tame some Evil Dragons. Convincing that fetishist Dragon wouldn’t be hard.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>“So you really do know about certain things. But still… we are allies. Can’t I get a discount?”</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Hmm… no. You are allies with the Devil faction and the current Satans. I am however not a subordinate of the Satans.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs didn’t stop him as he wanted to know what kind of person this Samuel White was. Till now, he had only heard about him from others.</p><p><br></p><p>Azazel eyed him and he nodded. “Oh, then where does your loyalty lie? We had just asked both the Heavenly Dragon’s hosts what they wanted as they had the power to subvert this peace. You can do the same with your skills although in a different way. So, we would like to know where you stand on this Peace Treaty and… what is it that you want?”</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Peace is good, ya know. I am totally for it. In fact, I don’t understand why people would want to start a war in the first place. So troublesome. I am more of a family man. I’d rather lay on my couch and watch anime than go and fight in a war. In fact, my dream is to become a doctor.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>Several people calmed down visibly at the answer. Azazel was not joking when he said that he could subvert peace of the whole world if he wanted.</p><p><br></p><p>Just twisting one of the several visions he has had could cause entire wars.</p><p><br></p><p>“A<em>s for my loyalty, it only lies with Rias Gremory. I am doing whatever I am to help her. And as you all know, she is currently not a part of the Three Factions, so neither am I.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>He was not exactly offended by the statement. In a way, he was glad that his sister had someone who genuinely cares about her by her side.</p><p><br></p><p>“I promise you that Rias will be welcomed back whenever she wishes to return. Her name will be cleared. The only reason I haven’t done so already despite the contribution you two have made is to avoid any suspicions towards you while you’re there.\" He quickly reassured him.</p><p><br></p><p>\"<em>And I thank you for that.</em>\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"You have done a great service to the Three Factions and are still doing great work. Being rewarded for it is only obvious.\" Michael added.</p><p><br></p><p>\"<em>Oh, is that so? Will Heaven also reward me?</em>\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"If there is something we can do then we would obviously like to help you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Great. First things first then. I would like the Church and Heaven to issue a public apology to Asia Argento and Xenovia Quarta for betraying them.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Michael’s words got stuck in his mouth. In fact, the entire Heaven’s side looked disturbed.</p><p><br></p><p>“You seem quite attached to this Asia Argento?” Azazed asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Obviously. I am her big brother.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. He had heard of it from her.</p><p><br></p><p>Michael took a deep breath and answered. “Asia Argento’s case was due to our own circumstances.”</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Oh I know that. The System is not working well due to you not being as proficient as your Father. The balance and all that, I know about it all. You forget who you are talking to.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>Michael stopped while on the other side, Sam continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>But it seems you people don’t understand the situation here. You all mooched off her hard work to gather faith and then when it got inconvenient, you just threw her, a seventeen year old girl away to survive in this world. And to begin with, she was exiled for healing a devil, right?</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Go on, answer.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes…” Michael replied, looking pained.</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>A Devil, injured at that, got into the church premises near a holy maiden, who I assume remains under some kind of protection at all times, and survived long enough to get healed and leave without revealing their identity. Only the fact that he was a Devil was revealed… am I the only one or does the whole situation seem kinda sus?</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>Heaven’s side was completely quiet.</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>I am not foolish enough to think that no one from the church was involved in this mess. Over the last two years, over one dozen Saintesses and Holy Maidens were exiled from the church for one reason or another and yet none of them were investigated. Are you telling me that none of you noticed this?  And let’s assume that you knew about her innocence and still exiled her only for the stability of the System, even then, there were several things you could have done. Arrange a source of livelihood for her. A way to assimilate her back in the general public. Provide her with some funds and some measure of security since she was being targeted by someone. But No. You all did nothing about it. Do you know why?</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>Michael looked ashamed and Gabriel was looking down. Even the exorcists looked down, fists clenched.</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>The actual reason is that none of you actually cared. After all, what can a mere seventeen year old girl do? Same for Xenovia. She was kicked out of the church for knowing the secret of your father’s death. But… almost the entire top brass knew the same and yet… every last one of them are still there while she was kicked out.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s not how….” Dulio Gesualdo tried explaining.</p><p><br></p><p>“I understand your anger but you must understand that the situation was not so easy..” Vasco Strada stated.</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>The situation eh?</em>” The voice on the other end took on a slightly steely tone for the first time. “<em>I don’t understand the situation huh?</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>Vasco Strada looked directly at the mobile at the centre of the room.</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>No Mr. BodyBuilder Priest, it’s not me who doesn’t understand. It is you people. Let me explain how. One thing first, Issei, can you leave the room for a moment please?</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh, me?” Issei looked surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Yes. It won’t take long. Give me two minutes.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at him and Sirzechs nodded so he left the room.</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Now that we are out of danger of Issei going Juggernaut Drive and erasing all of you before I can complete my sentence, let’s continue. My little sister was shamed as a witch and thrown out of the Church after they took advantage of her since her childhood due to you people’s negligence, got killed once due to Azazel’s negligence and the whole situation started because of Ajuka Beelzebub’s negligence.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>He winced as did the other leaders at the blatant reminder.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy on the other side continued. “<em>You ask me to understand the situation. Let me tell you what the situation actually was… if she hadn’t met Issei that day and was not saved by Rias, she would have died only to be resurrected by the one who organised the whole situation… only to be repeatedly violated till her mind breaks and she accepts that piece of crap as her saviour and God… just like the other Saintesses and Holy Maidens before her. You know, the same ones who put their trust in you people and were betrayed and called witches.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>The exorcist became extremely quiet.</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>My respect for the Church is in the negative. It’s right there with the Old Satan faction idiots. Actually, in a way even those idiots are better than you all. Do you know why?</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>No one answered.</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>At least when they do bad, they get a bad rep for it. You people on the other hand do as much if not more evil and still act as self righteous individuals who have the sun shining out of their… ughh behinds.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, he’s not wrong.” Azazel shrugged, but unlike normally, no one even bothered to reprimand him for it again.</p><p><br></p><p>Michael took control of the situation and again spoke.</p><p><br></p><p>“I apologise for the situation with Asia Argento. It was our mistake and I can’t tell you how much I regret it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Archangel Michael.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Saying my bad, I’m sorry doesn’t fix everything. If it did, there wouldn’t be a Fallen Angel and Devil faction in the first place.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Azazel -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Damn.” Shemhazai whispered.</p><p><br></p><p>And he couldn’t agree more.</p><p><br></p><p>He hadn’t met this guy but Azazel couldn’t remember Michael getting schooled that bad ever. The same went for the Church people.</p><p><br></p><p>First when he had heard about Sirzechs’ claims about a Seer, he was extremely skeptical. The information which he brought later on did somewhat make him believe in the idea.</p><p><br></p><p>Confronting Vali and confirming from him was what finally made him believe the news of this Samuel White.</p><p><br></p><p>Although Vali seemed oddly protective of the boy and didn’t give him much information about him.</p><p><br></p><p>But one thing was confirmed that this Samuel White was someone whom Vali had come to respect.</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>The first step to correct a mistake is to accept that you have committed the mistake, take responsibility for it and then work to make amends for it. Sirzechs is currently protecting Asia and Azazel is going to give her a method of self protection. They are doing their parts, you should do yours too.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>My sister was publicly shamed and called a witch and while she might not say anything because it’s not in her nature to blame anyone, she needs to have her image cleared publicly. I am not asking you to do something extreme but sometimes little things go a long way. Even now when, despite the pain, she still prays everyday. Do something about it. Same goes for Xenovia.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>Michael’s face took on a serious expression. “I give you my word that I would make sure both of them get the justice they deserve. We have really wronged them and I will make amends for it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Oh and Mr. Strada, please send Tosca to Rias’ older brother. I will unseal her when I go there for a meeting next. In the first place, you people didn’t deserve to keep her with you. Oh and make sure you give those Holy Sword factor pills… a good burial. They are still made up from the body parts of murdered kids. Don’t distribute them and call those abominations, blessings. Have some shame.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>Heaven's side looked red from shame.</p><p><br></p><p>Azazel wished he had a camera for this occasion. The sounds of the verbal slaps could be heard from the Heavens.</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Well that’s it.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>“Really? That’s it?” Azazel asked, sarcastically. This guy just gave Michael enough nightmare fuel to throw him into a century of depression and self-guilt. “Nothing else?”</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>What else would I need?</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>Azazel rolled his eyes. “What else, he asks.”</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Okay. I need to get to work now. I will send a message when it’s time.</em>” With that the call was cut.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs looked at Michael. “I apologise for his behaviour. He is a young man from what I have heard and they can get quite passionate about their thoughts.”</p><p><br></p><p>Michael however shook his head. “No. He didn’t lie. We did make a mistake with not only Asia Argento but also every other person he pointed out.”</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah. He was hurt badly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Moreover, in the entire conversation, he only got angry once and that too for someone else’s sake. He seemed like a very kind young man.” Gabriel joined.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sirzechs.” Michael continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Heaven would like to offer the reconstructed Excalibur Blade and one favour as an apology and a reward for the services.” He then turned towards Vasco Strada. “Investigate everyone involved with the exile of the Holy Maidens and nuns and arrest anyone who had a part in it. His words might have been harsh but they were true. We did betray our believers for the sake of our own convenience. There were other ways we could have handled the situation but we didn’t make an effort. This was our fault.”</p><p><br></p><p>\"Yes, Lord Michael.\"</p><p><br></p><p>“So… we apparently don’t have to worry about Dimension Lost and Annihilation Maker. Their combination would have been a nightmare to deal with in an overdrawn fight. And with the True Longinus user being trapped, all we need to worry about is the Old Satan faction. He more or less handled half the battle by himself before it even started. But seriously… what’s with your sister’s luck? First she finds the host of the Boosted Gear and now she unearths someone like this?” He asked Sirzechs who looked to be in thought.</p><p><br></p><p>“Her luck has blessed us with a hope for a long period of actual peace. Let’s be thankful that she is willing to put herself in such a situation to preserve this hard earned peace. I have come to hear of the situation in the Underworld and if possible, we would like to help her out in some way too.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs shook out of his reverie and thanked Michael for his consideration. “The work they are doing for our factions will not go unrewarded. I, as the current Lucifer… will make sure of it myself.”</p><p><br></p><p>Well, both of the leaders added something then he can’t stay back too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, I will see to it that everyone gets proper training for their Sacred Gears.”</p><p><br></p><p>They all discussed the upcoming attacks until the signal was sent.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Rias -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She watched as Koneko and Kuroka hugged each other, seeing more emotions on her face than she had seen for years.</p><p><br></p><p>But she had others who needed her too.</p><p><br></p><p>Gasper was latching on to her, crying as she tried to calm him down.</p><p><br></p><p>Asia, despite the relatively small time they had spent together, had tears in her eyes and Akeno… Akeno didn’t say anything, just stared at her.</p><p><br></p><p>Her best friend, sister in all but blood looking at her with pained eyes and almost reflexively words came out of her mouth. “I’m sorry.”</p><p><br></p><p>As Akeno was about to explain more, she came in front of her and hugged her, breaking down into tears, apologising repeatedly about the Rating Game.</p><p><br></p><p>“It was not your fault.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No. It was. I… I could have used that power. Things could have been different if I did. But I didn’t. I held back even when you were in danger… for my own pettiness.”</p><p><br></p><p>Her voice was choking as she tried to speak.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias just hugged her and slowly drew circles on her back, just like Sam did before, till she calmed down.</p><p><br></p><p>“If you are at fault, then I am just as much if not more at fault. But right now, we can't do anything about it. Living in pain will not help anyone.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But Yuuto...”</p><p><br></p><p>“Would not want any of us to live like this.” She cut off her statement even when she herself was feeling pained at the mention of the name.</p><p><br></p><p>A while later, everyone calmed down a bit and she told them about today’s plan.</p><p><br></p><p>“We need to fight you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I cannot reveal my identity to the enemies. We still need to pretend that we are on their side to find out what they are planning. For this reason, we need to fight and we need to make it convincing. I want you all to attack us with everything you have.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Noooooooo.” Gasper shouted, time stopping as she disappeared and into a corner of the room. “I don’t wannaaaa attack you, Buchou!”</p><p><br></p><p>“You will only be staying here, Gasper. We need you to use your Sacred Gear and the magic prepared by the attacking magicians to stop time temporarily to give them a feeling that their plan was successful.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We don’t need to fight them directly, you know.” Kuroka came to the rescue. “You could always fight the other two Devils and their peerages. It’s not like they will stand a chance against you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Fighting against both Sona, Latia and their peerages? It’s too dangerous.” Akeno protested.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nyahahahaha not really nya. They are good but the Princess here is far stronger. I have heard how they did against Kokabiel. If Rias were to seriously go after them, they wouldn’t stand a chance. Not to mention I will fight alongside her.”</p><p><br></p><p>“She is not wrong, Kuroka-san. Fighting against entire peerages can be dangerous. Moreover, they have others on their side too. The Slash Dog, Tobio Ikuse and the Trump Card of Heaven, Dulio Gesualdo. They even have Vasco Strada on their side. You participating in such a fight would be too dangerous Ojou-sama.” Mathers also pointed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Onee-sama.” Koneko protested.</p><p><br></p><p>“Everything will be fine nyaa. It’s not like we are here alone. Sam is talking to the leaders of the Three Factions. They would be aware of the plan too. We won’t be in any danger.” Kuroka explained.</p><p><br></p><p>It took a lot of time to finally convince them of the plan.</p><p><br></p><p>And just at the time, she received a call from Sam.</p><p><br></p><p>“We are ready.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Sam -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Three hours had passed.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at my Skill list in blank shock.

The pressure was massive.</p><p><br></p><p>The mobile in the middle of the room rang again and it was Grayfia who picked it up.</p><p><br></p><p>“It is time.” The voice from the other side said and everyone went into battle mode.</p><p><br></p><p>Even her sister went from her cheerful self to the one who had fought in the Civil War and was known as one of the strongest devils alive.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly, she felt a shift in the atmosphere.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked around her and found everything paused.</p><p><br></p><p>It had begun.</p><p><br></p><p>She and the rest were protected due to being in contact with the Satans through Saji’s Absorption Line.</p><p><br></p><p>Looking outside the window, she saw the magicians and devils appear.</p><p><br></p><p>In between the place, large magic circles appeared.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s….”</p><p><br></p><p>“The Leviathan and Asmodeus Clan’s Magic Circle….Katerea Leviathan and Creuserey Asmodeus.”</p><p><br></p><p>Azazel looked at the White Dragon Emperor and the Slash Dog. “Go on. Have fun.”</p><p><br></p><p>Archangel Michael sent the exorcists too while Lord Lucifer sent two of his peerage members.</p><p><br></p><p>The White Dragon Emperor threw a look at Issei and then a fleeting gaze at Vali. “Don’t get in between my fights.”</p><p><br></p><p>‘<em>Balance Breaker</em>’</p><p><br></p><p>‘Vanishing Dragon Balance Breaker’</p><p><br></p><p>‘Divine Dividing Scale Mail.’</p><p><br></p><p>A flash of light surrounded him and when it disappeared, he was covered in a White Armour. He jumped out of the window and flew towards the army, crushing anyone who stepped in his way. She felt a shiver down her spine at the level of power he was exhibiting. Even Latia, beside her, was stunned at the show of power.</p><p><br></p><p>The Slash Dog, Tobio Ikuse on the other hand was far more polite. He bowed at them. “I apologise for Vali. He is a bit anti-social but he doesn’t really mean anything.”</p><p><br></p><p>Azazel then threw a bracelet at Issei. “You can use this to temporarily enter the Balance Breaker state. Go on. I know you want to join the fight too.”</p><p><br></p><p>He joined in the fight and was doing reasonably well even when he wasn’t anywhere near the level of the ones who went before him.</p><p><br></p><p>Those monsters were crushing their opponents completely one-sidedly.</p><p><br></p><p>The Satans tried to negotiate with the Old Satan faction leaders but they were adamant on fighting.</p><p><br></p><p>Azazel took on the Leviathan descendant while the members of the Lucifer peerage confronted the Asmodeus descendant together.</p><p><br></p><p>She too looked at Latia and stepped into the first.</p><p><br></p><p>Their work was to keep Kuroka and Rias, who was under disguise, occupied.</p><p><br></p><p>And sure enough an attack came towards them. She and Latia both used barriers at full strength to defend. One of their barriers broke almost instantly and the other one barely held back the attack. She looked at the attacker and saw two black haired girls. One of them had golden eyes and cat ears and two tails while the other was a blue eyed one.</p><p><br></p><p>They looked at each other. </p><p><br></p><p>Rias was going through a very period of time and while there were some things which she didn’t agree on, what she was doing was something very few would dare to. For this alone, she could respect her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Who are you?” She asked as she conjured water snakes.</p><p><br></p><p>“My name is Stella. I have heard the little sister of Serafall Leviathan is quite talented. Let me see if those are only false rumours.” Rias smirked.</p><p><br></p><p>She was provoking her, knowing what she hated and using just that.</p><p><br></p><p>Well, it was a good thing they needed to put on a convincing show.</p><p><br></p><p>She sent the water snakes to attack. Her peerage members, Reya and Momo also used spells to attack while Saji and Tomoe ran towards her to attack at a close range</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka in the meanwhile engaged Latia and her peerage in a fight.</p><p><br></p><p>She was expecting her to put up a barrier to defend against the attack but contrary to her expectations, she just walked towards her at a casual pace.</p><p><br></p><p>What the heaven was she thinking?</p><p><br></p><p>She even had a smile on her face.</p><p><br></p><p>Just as Sona was wondering what happened, an attack from one of the stray magicians landed near her, breaking her attention. Her spell deviated, attacking the path Tomoe and Saji were on. They slipped and fell right in front of Rias who….gathered demonic power in her legs and kicked down, the force of the kick cracking the ground and knocking the two out instantly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Two down. Five more to go. Thank you for the assist.” With these words, she rushed towards them directly.</p><p><br></p><p>Sona broke out of her shock quickly and conjured several water snakes, sending them towards her but….one of her Magic Circles malfunctioned, sending it astray, crashing into the other water snake, clearing her path directly.</p><p><br></p><p>Tsubasa and Tsubaki stepped in front of her to guide her.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias sent a barrage of magic spells towards her.</p><p><br></p><p>Tsubaki took the lead and used her Mirror Alice and absorbed the attacks to reflect them back. Just as she was finished, Sona noticed a smile on Rias’ face and realised that they were tricked.</p><p><br></p><p>And sure enough, the attacks bounced off of her easily.</p><p><br></p><p>She had used harmless light spells, just making them look like magic bullets to trick Tsubaki into using her Mirror Alice and sending it into its cooldown time.</p><p><br></p><p>Tsubasa confronted her while Reya and Momo attacked her with spells.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias took Tsubasa’s punch but rather than confronting it directly, she directed it towards the side.</p><p><br></p><p>Martial Arts?</p><p><br></p><p>She knew that she wouldn’t be using her Power of Destruction. And while all High Class Devils, especially Pillar Devils were taught basic Martial Arts to defend themselves no one except outliers like Sairaorg Bael practised it or even used it in actual combat.</p><p><br></p><p>Especially Rias, who mostly preferred using magic to fight. Just what had she done in the last few months to match her Rook, no, toy with her rook like that?</p><p><br></p><p>“Cover Tsubasa.” She commanded as she did the same. “Back her up, Tsubaki.”</p><p><br></p><p>Tsubaki rushed while they prepared her spells.</p><p><br></p><p>In the meanwhile, Rias had managed to land a blow on Tsubasa’s guts, making her gasp for air. While she collected her, she twisted her hand and threw her at Tsubaki in what looked to be a Judo throw. Tsubaki caught Tsubasa, suddenly taken aback at the unexpected attack, blocking her hands.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias took this opportunity to rush towards them and take a hit.</p><p><br></p><p>Sona guided her water snakes to cut off her path and cover the two but this time, Momo’s attack went astray and attacked her water snakes, changing the path and attacking Tsubaki from the back while Rias took the opportunity to strike from the front with a punch infused with massive amounts of Demonic Power, sending them flying and knocking them out almost instantly.</p><p><br></p><p>Sona forcibly crushed her shock and analysed the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>The reason why she could rush so quickly was because there was some method she could use to disturb their magic and redirect their attacks.</p><p><br></p><p>Was it some kind of magic or artifact to disturb magic?</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>It was something else probably.</p><p><br></p><p>The first attack which deviated her water serpents came from the other side. Which means it was probably not magical interference. Also, controlling magical interferences at such a level is a feat done only by Ajuka Beelzebub as far as she knew.</p><p><br></p><p>Mastering such a technique would take a long time.</p><p><br></p><p>So this had to be something else.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you taking it easy on me by finishing off your own peerage members?” She taunted.</p><p><br></p><p>Sona reflexively answered. “Lucky shot.”</p><p><br>\"I guess you could call it that.\"</p><p><br></p><p>As they were about to continue fighting, a figure crashed into the school building, completely destroying one side of it.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked there to see the Governor General of the Fallen Angels, Azazel getting up from the wreckage.. She looked at the attacker and it was….the White Dragon Emperor.</p><p><br></p><p>The atmosphere quieted down instantly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you betraying us too, Vali?” Azazel looked up at the White Dragon Emperor while being helped to his feet by the Slash Dog. “Then again, you were always like them too. A descendant of their blood?”</p><p><br></p><p>“What!”</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone looked up at the White Dragon Emperor as eight devil wings popped out of his back.</p><p><br></p><p>“Vali Lucifer, the half devil great grandson of Lucifer and the White Dragon Emperor. He is what you would call a satanic miracle child and the strongest White Dragon Emperor to ever exist.” Azazel said. “What is your reason for doing this, Vali?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I just wish to challenge those stronger than me, Azazel. Your idea of peace doesn’t go well with this.”</p><p><br></p><p>The two other Satan descendants flew beside him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Since you have already decided on this, there is nothing to talk about.” Azazel brought out a golden dagger from his coat’s pocket. “Balance Breaker.”</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Downfall Dragon Another Armor.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>A flash of light later, he was covered in a golden scale mail similar to the White Dragon Emperor and flew up again.</p><p><br></p><p>Her sister and Archangel Gabriel joined the fight as well.</p><p><br></p><p>She almost instinctively tried to step in their direction only to be interrupted by a blast of magic in front of her. “Not now princess. You are not ready for that level of fight yet. I would be extremely sad if you were to be vaporised suddenly just by accidentally wandering close to those monsters.” She looked at the disguised Rias and realised what she was doing there.</p><p><br></p><p>The fight continued.</p><p><br></p><p>Vasco Strada swung his sword, releasing a wave of Holy Power towards them. The Leviathan and Asmodeus descendants flew away towards her sister and Gabriel while the White Dragon Emperor got ready to face them.</p><p><br></p><p>Tobio Ikuse also used his Sacred Gear to send a wave of black swords towards him and behind him Souji also joined.</p><p><br></p><p>Both attacks raced towards him, tearing up everything in front of it.</p><p><br></p><p>It was at this moment that a hole in space appeared directly in front of the White Dragon Emperor Vali.</p><p><br></p><p>Out of it came another familiar figure.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy with the mask. He held a sword in his hand. As the attacks came nearer, he swung his sword casually in a horizontal swing and Sona watched in awe as the attack which looked unstoppable to her….was cut into pieces and scattered into the air. The shockwave from the clash hit them near the outer parts of the battle field and she was thrown back several steps before she could barely stop with the help of barriers.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are late and that was my fight.” Vali Lucifer looked annoyed at the guy who merely scratched his head.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ahahahaha I opened a portal and saw an attack coming towards me. Scared the life out of me so I acted reflexively. Sorry about that.”</p><p><br></p><p>What bullshit. How was that a reflexive action?</p><p><br></p><p>“As for me being late. I was looking for the Hero faction. It seems those idiots tricked us. The barrier is locked but they are not participating in the fight. Seems like they want us to get beaten up. Scary!”</p><p><br></p><p>He remarked, almost childishly.</p><p><br></p><p>“A friend of yours, Vali?” Azazel asked, as he flew up to face Vali directly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes yes. Nice to meet you. My name is….Ichigo Kurosaki and I am gonna be the King of the Pirates….believe it dattebayo.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>She looked towards her side at Rias and asked. “Is he mad?”</p><p><br></p><p>Rias just looked embarrassed while Kuroka who had just forced Latia towards them laughed at her question. “He is her boyfriend.”</p><p><br></p><p>What!</p><p><br></p><p>Wait….is he?</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at Rias for confirmation who didn’t deny anything but rather had a light blush.</p><p><br></p><p>Once more she looked at the guy and back at Rias. “Seriously.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I told him not to fool around today.” She replied slowly.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka on the other hand just laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>They however didn’t have much time to laugh as the battle started in earnest.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Issei used the bracelet made by Azael to enter a Balance Breaker mode and join in.</p><p><br></p><p>The new guy faced Vasco Strada, Tobio Ikuse and Okita Souji while Issei went after Vali, backing Azazel up who looked to be a bit injured from the previous sneak attack.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone watched from the side to find out more about the new guy, whom by now Sona was pretty sure was the mysterious Samuel White from Rias’ reaction.</p><p><br></p><p>Vasco Strada went in first, slashing down with a replica of the Durandal while Souji and Tobio attacked from both flanks, each of them going for a vital part.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Satan class beings wouldn’t take such an attack lightly and yet….and yet, the guy, self-proclaimed Ichigo Kurosaki stood there motionless.</p><p><br></p><p>The next second they understood the reason why when under the stunned expressions of everyone, he lifted his sword, blocking all the three slashes with….the tip of his sword. All their swords were….stopped by his sword tip striking at the point where their lines overlapped together.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the three attackers didn’t believe it.</p><p><br></p><p>He twisted his wrist and their swords were scattered from their initial path.</p><p><br></p><p>The three took their positions around him but what came after was completely unexpected. It seemed as if he was dancing in between them, all their attacks passing just by him, never actually touching him even lightly.</p><p><br></p><p>All of those three were swordsmen whose skills were recognised by the whole world, said to rival even Gods. Two of them were even touted as the strongest humans alive and yet, they were being toyed around by one man without being able to put any kind of resistance at all.</p><p><br></p><p>From the start to the end, he used nothing but swordsmanship in the fight to take on all three of them.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Vali Lucifer -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He kicked his so-called fated Rival, making him go crashing into the ground once more.</p><p><br></p><p>It was disappointing.</p><p><br></p><p>He had heard from Sam that this person would grow on to rival him in a very short time, surpassing all the previous Red Dragon Emperors who came before him, even releasing the true power of the Heavenly Dragons but right now….all that seemed like an empty dream.</p><p><br></p><p>From the corner of his eyes he looked at Sam who had grown stronger once more.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>They had all noticed his abnormal jump in power over time and his ever changing magical aura.</p><p><br></p><p>Albion had conjectured that it could have something to do with the summoning ritual. Maybe he was forming some kind of connection with the dead since they were trying to summon Lucifer in his body originally. These dead souls’ memories and powers were being inherited by him somehow.</p><p><br></p><p>It could be anything. Since the ritual was destroyed, they would never know. But one thing was for <a href=\"https://sure….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sure….it</a> was not normal.</p><p><br></p><p>And it was not like he minded it. The stronger people he could fight, the better he would get so having an ever evolving sparring partner beside him will only push him to grow stronger. It was a win. As for him getting <a href=\"https://stronger….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">stronger….it</a> was only normal. He was a Lucifer. It was absolutely understandable.</p><p><br></p><p>On the other side, Katerea was getting beaten up by Serafall Leviathan and Gabriel while Azazel was owning the foolish Asmodeus.</p><p><br></p><p>Katerea was thrown into the ground by a jet of Holy Water, making a crater in the place where she crashed. One of her arms was missing, frozen at her elbow.</p><p><br></p><p>Even with the borrowed power from Ophis, she didn’t have anywhere close to the Skill necessary to face the likes of those two. One was someone who had faced and defeated even her ancestor while the other was someone who was said to have surpassed her ancestor. The same ancestor which she drivels about so much, her only claim to fame.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will say this again, Katerea. Give up. We don’t need to end it like this.” Serafall Leviathan offered.</p><p><br></p><p>“You! Do you think this will end so easily? Do you think we will let it end just like that? Even if we die, we will make sure you all suffer too.” A black aura appeared around her.</p><p><br></p><p>Self Destruction?</p><p><br></p><p>But contrary to everyone’s expectations, she gathered the aura in her hand and she threw <a href=\"https://it….at\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">it….at</a> Serafall’s little sister….who was fighting with….</p><p><br></p><p>He wanted to move in but the attack was too fast. The area where they were exploded as a small mushroom cloud went up the sky.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Several auras exploded at that very instant.</p><p><br></p><p>A quick look showed him that Serafall Leviathan was looking at the scene with a vacant look in her eyes but the one whom he was feeling the most danger was from Sirzechs Lucifer. His skin was being tinged with his aura of destruction as he looked at the explosion with a blank gaze.</p><p><br></p><p>Even he himself felt an unexpected burst of rage well up within him. “What is the meaning of this Katerea?” He growled. “You attacked my people.”</p><p><br></p><p>It was the Asmodeus who answered, being able to get back as Azazel himself was shocked at the sudden change of events and provided him with an opening.</p><p><br></p><p>“She should be proud that she was able to be of use to the True Satans. You shouldn’t have brought weaklings with you. She was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.”</p><p><br></p><p>He clenched his fists. “When you die today….remember that it was your own fault.”</p><p><br></p><p>‘Vali, get away from this place. Quickly.’</p><p><br></p><p>He backed away as fast as he could as a shout was heard.</p><p><br></p><p>“Getsuga, Tenshou!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Wha….” Katerea looked in the direction of the sound but she was too late.</p><p><br></p><p>A wave of black light flashed.</p><p><br></p><p>Even as he was backing away, Vali saw a thin line appearing on Katerea’s body, vertically, before her body was bisected in two and fell down.</p><p><br></p><p>The look of confusion still plastered on her face.</p><p><br></p><p>But what attracted his attention was not Katerea but rather what the attack had caused behind her.</p><p><br></p><p>The entire barrier meant to stop several Satan Class beings was cut apart.</p><p><br></p><p>Behind it….the clouds in the sky were also bisected in two, leaving the moonlight sky for everyone to see.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked in the direction of the explosion which was cut apart in the previous attack and a figure slowly appeared in the place.</p><p><br></p><p>There, he stood, his mask had broken down, his body covered entirely in blood, carrying the Holy Sword Durandal in his hand and twelve wings spread behind his back as wisps of black fire slowly healed his wounds. Behind him, was a barrier where the girls were on their knees completely safe.</p><p><br></p><p>And then he spoke while eying the Asmodeus, “I was attacking a mosquito. She was <a href=\"https://just….in\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">just….in</a> the wrong <a href=\"https://place….at\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">place….at</a> the wrong time.”</p><p>____________________________x_________________________________________________________x_____________________________</p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><a href=\"https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I know people will not believe this when I say that I really didn’t plan for this cliff.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I truly didn’t.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I just reached my usual chapter length and this was the best place to stop.

They were just hiding and watching the fight go on. Azazel had ordered Vali to not hold back and bring down Kokabiel at the fastest speed.</p><p><br></p><p>At this point, they were just putting on a show to later use this incident as a trigger for the Peace Conference.</p><p><br></p><p>I wonder how Kokabiel would feel if he knew that his biggest move to cause a war was just a sham to make peace.</p><p><br></p><p>Vali didn’t play around either and Kokabiel was destroyed in a matter of seconds. The guy didn’t even get any chances to speak.</p><p><br></p><p>The reason I was here was for something else entirely.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Sona Sitri -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Kneeling on the ground to catch her breath, she looked at the guy in the white armour flying in the air above them. In his hands was the reason for their condition.</p><p><br></p><p>Fighting a cadre was nothing like she had expected. They were destroyed one sidedly. She would admit that she had thought that even if they couldn’t win against him, they could at least hold him back or repel him. She was touted as one of the four strongest devils of the youngest generation and she had confidence in her strategic abilities but… he just crushed all those with brute strength. It was a massive wound to their pride.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked around. The only one still on her feet was Asia because she hadn't directly participated in the battle.</p><p><br></p><p>Just fighting off the Cerberus had been difficult for them but Akeno and Latia did it with the boosts from Issei. The boy had been relentless in this fight as well, boosting everyone to make up for their lack of strength.</p><p><br></p><p>And this guy… the rival of the Red Dragon Emperor, just finished off someone like that in moments.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a rude awakening for all of them. In fact, she had noticed that Rias’ peerage members had fought much better in this fight than hers. She knew that they had more potential than her peerage members but this was not just because of that. All of them had trained extremely hard in the past month to get to this level.</p><p><br></p><p>Just as she was thinking of this, she felt a chill down her spine and recognised the presence of Holy Aura behind her.</p><p><br></p><p>She turned just in time to see the deranged face of that exorcist boy a metre away from her with the combined Excalibur in his hand.</p><p><br></p><p>He must have used the Excalibur Transparency to hide, dammit.</p><p><br></p><p>A wall of ice was created in front of her, separating the attacker from her. The exorcist attacked nonetheless. A sword containing five fragments of the Holy Sword Excalibur, tearing away at the ice.</p><p><br></p><p>She froze as she felt her skin tingle from the Holy Aura but the sword never reached her. A pillar of flame descended from on top of the exorcist.</p><p><br></p><p>The ice wall became thicker and she saw the one creating the said wall. Grayfia.</p><p><br></p><p>When the fire pillar subsided, there was nothing left of the exorcist, only the sword.</p><p><br></p><p>The ice wall had melted.</p><p><br></p><p>Grayfia stood protectively in front of her and looked up. She followed her gaze and found another figure in the sky above them.</p><p><br></p><p>A guy with a mask.</p><p><br></p><p>“You missed one.” He looked at the white armoured guy who merely shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>“I was only told to bring Kokabiel. The others were not my problem.”</p><p><br></p><p>The first guy merely sighed.</p><p><br></p><p>From his voice, he seemed relatively young.</p><p><br></p><p>“Anyways, they had several of the stronger Devils in hiding anyway. They can take care of this. Let’s go.”</p><p><br></p><p>They both flew away with those words.</p><p><br>What?!</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at Grayfia in front of her. Were they present there from the very start?</p><p><br></p><p>“I didn’t know you were coming here too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Just didn’t want to take any chances.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then we have nothing left to do here. Let’s go.” White Dragon Emperor said before turning to Issei. “I was really looking forward to meeting my rival but you disappointed me.”</p><p><br></p><p>They teleported away, leaving everyone with a complicated emotion.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Sam -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“So what’s your real goal?” Vali asked as we got a little bit away from the Devils.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am out to recruit.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Who?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The Durandal wielder. She would get thrown aside by the Church. Just wanted to make sure nothing happened to her.”</p><p><br></p><p>\"Is she strong?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"She has potential.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Your responsibility then.\"</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded. I was talking to him but had already started copying Kokabiel’s Skill.</p><p><br></p><p>The Fallen Angel cadre had several C Ranked Skills but I wanted to test my theory so I went after his C Ranked Fallen Angel Bloodline.</p><p><br></p><p>The Skill was copied in twenty minutes and I smiled as my speculation was proved correct once again.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>S Ranked Luck</strong></p><p><strong>A Ranked Severing</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Holy Demonic Magic</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Lucifer Bloodline</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Belial Bloodline</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Phenex Bloodline</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Belphegor Bloodline</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Demonic Power</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Touki</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Devil Magic</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Enhanced Physique</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Magic Resistance</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Swordsmanship</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Senjutsu</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked General Human Magic</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Curse Magic</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Elemental Magic(Human)</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Light Resistance</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Holy Resistance</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Light Magic</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Enhanced Reflexes</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Enhanced Strength</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Enhanced Endurance</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Enhanced Speed</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I felt my power rising with the Lucifer Bloodline jumping to the B Rank with the addition of Kokabiel’s Bloodline. In a sense, it did make sense. Lucifer rebelled so first he must have Fallen before doing whatever he did to acquire Demonic Power… and Kokabiel was his brother.</p><p><br></p><p>The Bloodlines matching to some extent was a given.</p><p><br></p><p>I had three B Ranked Bloodlines now and twelve wings. In fact, I could even control my Phenex side to make twelve wings of fire manifest instead of normal ones.</p><p><br></p><p>Vali went to bring Kokabiel to Grigori by himself.</p><p><br></p><p>With today's gains, I returned back home.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias was at home already.</p><p><br></p><p>The atmosphere was quite strange today. I had all but proposed to her by my actions. It might have been in the heat of the moment but now things are strange.</p><p><br></p><p>Our relationship has been quite ambiguous for the last few weeks and while none of us put things to words, our actions said it all.</p><p><br></p><p>\"How did things go on your side?\"</p><p><br></p><p> She asked me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Quite good. I was able to get Kokabiel’s Bloodline and my guess was correct.\" I replied as I took off my jacket.</p><p><br></p><p>She took it from me and kept it in the cupboard while I washed my face.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Anything else happened?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"They took our information well. There were several powerful devils in the place. Grayfia was there too. There was that Freed guy though. He was actually planning to take Sona hostage but Grayfia intervened and then I took him out. And no they didn't see my face. I was using a mask.\" I answered before she could worry.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I see.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Did you eat? I will get something ready in a minute.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I made something already. I was just waiting for you to return.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Let me take a bath then.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I need to take a bath too. Let me join you.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hmm.\"</p><p><br></p><p>We undressed and got in for a bath. It was what we had been doing for over a month and half now but today it was awkward.</p><p><br></p><p>She removed the dye from her hair today and her crimson hair was out again.</p><p><br></p><p>Dammit, she always looks mind numbingly beautiful with this hair colour. </p><p><br></p><p>I let out a sigh of relief within my head when she took a seat with her back on my chest once more.</p><p><br></p><p>At least she wasn't angry.</p><p><br></p><p>It was then that I understood something.</p><p><br></p><p>I was afraid that if I said those words and was rejected, things would get very awkward and so, I just kept quiet.</p><p><br></p><p>The atmosphere lasted even when we ate our dinner.</p><p><br></p><p>When it was time to sleep, as a ritual for us now, we undressed. and got in the bed just like everyday.</p><p><br></p><p>Normally, we talk about one thing or another but today there were no words.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly, a few hours in, she turned towards me and buried her face in my chest. I caressed her hair and then leaned to place a kiss on her head lightly.</p><p><br></p><p>Minutes passed but from our breathing I knew that none of us were sleeping.</p><p><br></p><p>I closed my eyes and thought about something. This world is dangerous. There wasn’t a guarantee of what might happen tomorrow. If I were to die tomorrow, what would I regret the most?</p><p><br></p><p>Not being able to see my family once more.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>The last month or so, it was a thought I was subconsciously acclimating myself to already. The chance that I could return back home was next to none.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the reasons I worked so hard was to keep myself busy to not remember this.</p><p><br></p><p>During this time, the girl in my arms had been an irreplaceable support to me. So much so that I can’t even think of a life without her.</p><p><br></p><p>When I tried to think of such a life, it felt… so empty.</p><p><br></p><p>Fuck… I am really in love with her.</p><p><br></p><p>Just what the fuck am I doing being a coward like this? I let out a sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did something happen?” Hearing the sigh, she looked up at me and asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I was thinking of something.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Something worrying you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I… was thinking of what I would regret if something were to happen to me right now.”</p><p><br></p><p>She stifled so I caressed her back.</p><p><br></p><p>“And somehow when I thought earnestly, I found out that not being able to see my family for the last time was… not the top thing.”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked up at me curiously. Her gaze was filled with worry. Just pure genuine worry and care for me.</p><p><br></p><p>One look into her blue eyes and I knew what I needed to do.</p><p><br></p><p>I took a deep breath.</p><p><br></p><p>“You alright, Sam?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I love you Rias.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh!”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>– Rias –</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She looked at him with wide opened eyes as if doubting that she had fallen asleep and this was just a dream, a very sweet dream which she wanted to continue forever.</p><p><br></p><p>The past two months had brought her closer to Sam. More than she had been to anyone else.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe it was just their circumstances or maybe it was their compatibility with each other or maybe a combination of both but the fact that she felt the most comfortable when she was in his arms like just now.</p><p><br></p><p>She couldn’t even imagine what she would do if she lost this. And so, even when she knew everything, even when she knew for sure that he felt the same, especially after what happened today, she couldn’t bring herself to say those words... just because of that minuscule chance that she would be disappointed and lose all of this.</p><p><br></p><p>There was also a chance that he would agree but only for her sake, not because he wanted to. She didn’t want to take advantage of him.</p><p><br></p><p>But to hear him say those words, now she didn’t know how to react.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked as his expression turned from earnest to slightly pained and then disappointed and realised that she was in daze for too long and he was misunderstanding things.</p><p><br></p><p>“I’m sor…” He began to say but couldn’t complete because she leaned in and shut his mouth with her own lips. His breath stilled but only for a moment before he responded as his arms wrapped around her protectively and she let herself melt into it as she concentrated on enjoying this moment.</p><p><br></p><p>Their lips barely separated from each other for who knew how long and when they did, she lay her head on his chest, listening to his heartbeat.</p><p><br></p><p>“What made you suddenly confess today?” She asked, intrigued.</p><p><br></p><p>She felt him chuckle lightly.</p><p><br></p><p>“I didn’t want to be like those idiots who like the girl but don’t say it till she is taken away by others only to cry later. That's a classic ntr plot, ya know?”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at him incredulously.</p><p><br></p><p>“What? You wanted some high and mighty reason? I confessed because I love you. What else would I need? Is this not okay with you?”</p><p><br></p><p>She thought for a second and she really didn’t mind. So what if it wasn’t an anime level of fancy scene. This was her own scene and she loved it just how it was.</p><p><br></p><p>But still… she was in the mood to get spoiled right now. “So, what do you like about me?” She smirked. “Is it because I’m <em>one of</em> your favourite waifus?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, let me think.” He turned towards her, gazing into her eyes. “First, it was a bit because of it. I mean who wouldn’t love their favourite waifu if they appeared right in front of them?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh favourite? Not one of your favourites?”</p><p><br></p><p>“You are never letting it go, are you?” He sighed and she giggled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Never.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, favourite. You have supported me in what was and probably is the darkest point of my life yet and I don’t know when I just fell in love with you. As for what I like about you? I like everything. I like your crimson hair, your blue eyes, your beautiful smile, your caring nature, the way you immerse yourself when watching an anime, the way you brush your hair behind your ears when working, the way you…”</p><p><br></p><p>She was blushing red at this point and didn’t want him to continue because of her embarrassment so she did the only thing she knew to shut him up.</p><p><br></p><p>They kissed again.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Sam -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Really, this girl is an enigma.</p><p><br></p><p>She was laying naked in my arms but me complimenting her is what makes her blush. She was now hiding in my chest to avoid looking into my eyes due to her embarrassment. And I just teased her a bit.</p><p><br></p><p>The good thing was that the awkwardness between us was completely gone now.</p><p><br></p><p>We slept very peacefully together.</p><p><br><br></p><p>_________________________________x_________________________________</p><p><br><br></p><p>Kuroka returned the next day.</p><p><br></p><p>She was keeping an eye on Xenovia yesterday, being the most experienced one among us with these types of things. I was still learning.</p><p><br></p><p>As expected, Xenovia was excommunicated by the Church as soon as she asked about the information about God.</p><p><br></p><p>Another piece of information we got was that Rias’ former peerage members were participating in the Youth Devil Tournament under Damon Glasya-Labolas. It looks like Sirzechs was making good use of the information we had given him.</p><p><br></p><p>Then we got another piece of news. Two weeks later, the Peace Conference was going to be held at Kuoh Academy.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why are you two so lovey dovey today nya~?” Kuroka asked, narrowing her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Excuse me? We are just as we always were.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No no. There is something different.” Her eyes widened suddenly. “Did you two do it! Congratulations, princess. You are a woman now. Well played, Rias. Well played.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What nonsense are you talking about? We did nothing of that sort.” I retorted.</p><p><br></p><p>“Lies. The way the princess is blushing with a tinge of smugness. My cat instincts can’t be wrong about this.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We just kissed, alright.” I finally relented, sighing.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh? Just that? Aww, that’s so precious.” She spoke, making the already embarrassed girl even more flustered.</p><p><br></p><p>I held her hand below the table and we completed eating our food.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>Xenovia was easy to recruit.</p><p><br></p><p>She was already without any purpose and jumped at the opportunity to get a purpose in life when Rias offered her one.</p><p><br></p><p>It’s just that she was a total muscle head.</p><p><br></p><p>She had no sense of tact and could blurt out our secrets at any time so she wasn’t included when we had to participate in the Khaos Brigade headquarters.</p><p><br></p><p>Most of the time, she trained under Arthur or me.</p><p><br></p><p>I got a C Ranked Holy Swordsman Skill from her. Just another thing to add to my collection by now.</p><p><br></p><p>The Youth Devil Conference was in three months.</p><p><br></p><p>I needed to get stronger.</p><p><br></p><p>But before the Youth Devil Conference, there was another event.</p><p><br></p><p>We were called to the Headquarters of Khaos Brigade to discuss it.</p><p><br></p><p>So, here we are, sitting around the same table to find out how they planned to mess up this time.</p><p><br></p><p>Our seating position this time was near the Old Satan faction which included Shalba, Katerea and Creusery. There was an unexpected addition to this group. Silver braided hair and red eyes. The man was actually stronger than all three of the Satan descendants if we didn’t include the snake of Ophis boosting their power.</p><p><br></p><p>On the other side was the Magician Organisation.</p><p><br></p><p>I also noticed that all of the Satan Descendants had flawed bloodlines which meant they didn’t inherit their clan traits. How surprising. But they had enough good things to copy. I mean all of them had C Ranked Demonic Powers boosted to a B Rank with Ophis’ Snake.</p><p><br></p><p>My Demonic Power was already in the B Rank and still increasing but hey, all help is appreciated.</p><p><br></p><p>The thing I copied from Euclid was his B Ranked Magical Science Knowledge. The idiots were discussing ways to interrupt the Peace Conference and kill the leaders. The plan was the same as before. They were planning to use Gasper’s Sacred Gear to incapacitate the faction leaders and take them down.</p><p><br></p><p>It was so fucking stupid that I didn’t even have words for it. But somehow they believed that it would work.</p><p><br></p><p>Did they really think it would work? With only B Ranked powers?</p><p><br></p><p>Just because they could overload a Sacred Gear? If it were so easy, Forbidden Balor View users would have been ruling the world by now.</p><p><br></p><p>Euclid was actually deciding to throw his own input here because currently Gasper was Grayfia’s peerage member and that made it personal for him.</p><p><br></p><p>I felt Rias grab my hand under the table and I slowly caressed the back of it.</p><p><br></p><p>There were arguments about who would go. Vali was automatically in as he was going as Azazel’s guard. As for the others who would join the attack would be Katerea and Creuserey.</p><p><br></p><p>One more than what I knew of. This meant that the butterflies were already flapping their wings and changes were starting to affect the whole world.</p><p><br></p><p>The meeting went on and I was able to get three Devil Magic Cards from all three Satan Descendants.</p><p><br></p><p>My Demonic Power had reached B Rank yesterday soon after my Lucifer Bloodline reached B Rank and it was still rising at an insane rate. These people were the descendants of the strongest families of the Devils. Surely, they would have some magic which would be above normal devils.</p><p><br></p><p>Not to mention, I wasn’t going to copy Demonic Power or Magical Power in front of Ophis. She had caught me the last time and even today, she was just staring at me.</p><p><br></p><p>We went out on a break to gather again.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka entered the room fuming. “Those damned bastards. I will…”</p><p><br></p><p>“What happened?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It was the Hero faction idiots. Heracles and Cao Cao.” She replied with gritted teeth.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy was being a dick. He was asking Heracles to provoke us to cause a fight.</p><p><br></p><p>Basically looking for a reason to fight it out.</p><p><br></p><p>From the information we received, he had attained an incomplete version of his Balance Breaker and was looking to show off.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ignore them. We just need to get this done with. If they attack however… don’t hold back. Just don’t let them pick us off separately.” Vali ordered while listening to music in one corner of the room.</p><p><br></p><p>I sighed. These people were really kids.</p><p><br></p><p>And I was proven right. When we returned for the meeting, Cao Cao, that idiot was keeping the True Longinus out just to edge out our team which had four Devils. The smirks on their faces were already evident of this.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka was openly glaring at them while Vali didn’t even bother to look at them.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias was feeling uncomfortable but was holding the discomfort.</p><p><br></p><p>As for me, I was checking the Skills on the True Longinus.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>S Ranked Sealing Magic</strong></p><p><strong>A Ranked God’s Bloodline<br>A Ranked Divine Will<br>A Ranked Divine Magic<br>A Ranked Holy Magic</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Wow.</p><p><br></p><p>It wasn’t even funny how busted it was. And this was a wisp of his will.</p><p><br></p><p>This alone made me realise how busted God of the Bible must have been when he was alive.</p><p><br></p><p>S Ranked Sealing Magic.</p><p><br></p><p>I so wanted to copy it but there was no way for Cao Cao to sit here for 9 hours without moving.</p><p><br></p><p>Dammit… what should I do?</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully someone else intervened. Katerea was offended at the sight of the spear. “Keep that abomination away. If you cannot contribute anything to the meeting then sit back quietly like the cowards you are.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What did you say?” He growled as he got up with the spear.</p><p><br></p><p>I watched wishing I had some popcorn on me.</p><p><br></p><p>The matter didn’t escalate much but Cao Cao kept back the True Longinus.</p><p><br></p><p>I took this opportunity to throw in some fuel on the fire. \"You know, while the idea of using magicians for barriers is good. Using the Dimension Lost would ensure there are no accidents. We are planning to assassinate the current leaders of the Three Factions, not some commoners from the streets.\"</p><p><br></p><p>My team looked at me curiously, while the Hero faction looked offended.</p><p><br></p><p>\"And why should we work for them?\" Cao Cao bristled.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Eh? I thought you all would appreciate this choice. I mean, wasn't your entire thing fighting with strong supernaturals? And I am pretty sure none of your ancestors would have done something like this. Obviously, if you are scared… I mean I did think you wave around that spear too much to overcompensate for certain things…\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"What did you say!\" The guy stood up, aura rising.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Me? Which one? The second one?It was an innuendo about how you have a small penis. The first one was advice about making a barrier around the Peace Conference to isolate the leaders of the Three Faction. Did you not hear it properly? You got cotton in your ears bro?\"</p><p><br></p><p>Before the matters could get any words, Euclid interrupted. \"What he said wasn't wrong. Making a barrier around the place, not to mention using the True Longinus would make the success rate of the mission go much higher.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Are you trying to say that we are weak, Euclid?\" Katerea asked, warning in her voice.</p><p><br></p><p>\"No. I am merely talking about the off case that someone escapes. After all, it's better to be prepared for such cases.\"</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Euclid who nodded at me.</p><p><br></p><p>The fuck is with that nod, dammit. What's with adding the True Longinus?</p><p><br></p><p>I took a deep breath and calmed myself.</p><p><br></p><p>Now I will have to think of something. Actually, I can just send the message to Rias' peerage and through her to Sirzechs and let them take care of it.</p><p><br></p><p>\"If that's the case then you don't mind joining the attack, do you? Giving advice is easy. But are you brave enough to stand and fight?\" Cao Cao taunted.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Eh! Brave? Me? No way. I am just a normal chef. I'll pass. Thank you.\"</p><p><br></p><p>He was completely stunned at the reply.</p><p><br></p><p>What? Never expected the reply? Did you think I will just jump in like a xianxia protagonist and be Junior, you dare or courting death? I am more of the shameless protagonist types. I would totally kick you when you are down and poison your milk to kill you off because I have no intention of unnecessarily risking myself.</p><p><br></p><p>The other people dissed me while the members of the Vali team just laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>As usual the meeting ended soon enough and this time I copied some Skills from the Magicians to pass the time.</p><p><br></p><p>When we went back to the base, Vali questioned me. \"What was all that about?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"A trap. I will inform Rias' brother about the plan and disable Georg's Sacred Gear during the attack. If Georg were to get captured or die, the Hero faction would lose more than half their power. Not to mention if Cao Cao were to get captured….\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Did you see anything again?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Cao Cao and the Hero faction would attack Kyoto but worse still, they will attack the Underworld and steal Ophis' power.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"That's impossible.\" Albion appeared behind Vali and said.</p><p><br></p><p>I immediately started the copy on the <strong>S Ranked Divide</strong>. A funny thing was that Boosts can be obtained from Twice Criticals but Divide was only available in the Divine Dividing. I would have liked Reflect but Mirror Alice has Reflect too. Divide on the other hand was just too versatile to let go.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Not if they use the Dragon Eater.\"</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>\"But that's…\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Sealed. But Hades has a massive hate boner for 2/3rds of the Abrahamic factions. He will lend it to Cao Cao who will then overload the Annihilation Maker and cause riots in the Underworld. Heavy destruction. Rebellion of the Reincarnated Devils but to be honest that was the fault of the Devil race. They use the dispersed power of Ophis to create a new Dragon, Lilith who becomes Rizevim Livan Lucifer's bodyguard and things go to shit from there.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Vali's attention was focused on Rizevim's name, so I took the opportunity to tell them of some of the future events. We discussed what would be our next plan of action and how we can stop them before they can cause any damage.</p><p><br></p><p>I delayed some explanations and dragged out some topics to get to the three hour mark. Thankfully, the room was small enough for us to be in range.</p><p><br></p><p>Three hours later, Divide was copied.</p><p><br></p><p>It was decided that Kuroka and I will take care of sending the message to Sirzechs.</p><p><br></p><p>They will investigate Valerie while Arthur and Ley Fey will search for the information about the ancient weapon of the Gods, a Stone Giant, Gomagog. They had heard about it from Ophis. They were also investigating Ingvild Leviathan and seeing if we could do something about her.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, the Nebiros House which had the Malebranche.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn't even want to get close to them until I was a good way into the A Rank.</p><p><br></p><p>We all left for our respective homes.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka went out to investigate stuff while Rias and I returned back home. Xenovia was there alone, training in the Underground training room.</p><p><br></p><p>I rechecked to see if she was coming back and then hugged Rias from behind.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Sam!\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hmm.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Xenovia is at home.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"She's training. I checked already.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Let's go to our room. Not here. She can come at any moment.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"So? Let her see how much I love my girlfriend.\" I teased as the blush on her face became atomic.</p><p><br></p><p>I was loving this side of her which I discovered since my confession. It was just so refreshing as well as a stark contrast to the usual bold type persona which she exhibited generally.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>– Xenovia –</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She wiped off her sweat, having finished her training. The gravity training was tough but it gave results too.</p><p><br></p><p>Just within a period of a week, her life had changed. From an exorcist who hunted devils to becoming one herself.</p><p><br></p><p>But then again, at least this way she has a goal in life.</p><p><br></p><p>Shaking her head, she went up to get cleaned and make something to eat.</p><p><br></p><p>She noticed the presence of people in the room. Did they return from the meeting?</p><p><br></p><p>She headed to the door of their room to ask them about the meeting but was stopped when she heard weird voices.</p><p><br></p><p>The door was slightly open and she could see what was going on within.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias and Sam were completely naked, making out with each other.</p><p><br></p><p>They broke their kiss after several minutes and Sam went down, taking her breasts in his mouth while his other hand played with her other breast.</p><p><br></p><p>She moaned, grabbing his hair and pushing him against her breasts harder.</p><p><br></p><p>One of his hands slipped down between her legs and her body arched suddenly.</p><p><br></p><p>He went down from her breasts to between her thighs. Xenovia saw her biting her lips and covering her mouth with one hand to stifle her moans.</p><p><br></p><p>Their moans were resounding in the room and Xenovia found herself feeling a little strange. Obviously she knew what they were doing. Sam was a Lucifer, the strongest among the Devil bloodlines. He was obviously the prime choice for having a child for any female Devil.</p><p><br></p><p>They were obviously practising for future reproduction. Xenovia observed them and took notes.</p><p><br></p><p>Was that how big all men were supposed to be?</p><p><br></p><p>Rias took a hold of the thing and placed a kiss on the tip before taking the entire tip into her mouth and licked it. He groaned in what Xenovia thought was pleasure as he was caressing her head lightly. She bobbed her head up and down, taking a bit more of the whole thing every time. Xenovia found her hand’s reaching between her legs as she was beginning to get hotter. Her finger traced her own slit and moved in the same rhythm as Rias was moving her head.</p><p><br></p><p>Both sides were getting heated up when she heard Sam groaning. He gripped Rias’ hair and pulled her in and she hugged him too despite the slight gag. Sam pulled back after a few moments and Xenovia observed her gulping something.</p><p><br></p><p>“That was hot nyaa. Just kissed my sexy butt. I knew something was going on.” A voice came from behind her. She was about to yelp but a hand shut her mouth, preventing her from shouting. “Be quiet or they will hear us.”</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka!</p><p><br></p><p>She hadn’t noticed when but Kuroka had slipped behind her and was currently in the same position as her. The kimono she was wearing had slipped down her shoulder and her hands were between her thighs, touching her core while she watched the raunchy scene in the room.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t make noise or Sam will notice us instantly nyaa. I am hiding us with great difficulty nyaa. Sam has gotten very good at Senjutsu.”</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next hour or so, both Kuroka and she shared some ideas about their ideal mate. She found out that Sam had grown immensely in the last two months and was extremely talented. In fact Kuroka wanted him as a mate too but Rias was first and she was just maintaining courtesy.</p><p><br></p><p>As for watching, this was just collecting information to ensure better performance.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. Just preparing for her own future.</p><p><br></p><p>As Kuroka said, 'Know yourself and know your enemy and a thousand battles will be won.'</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Sam -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I was back in Kuoh to pass on the information about the attack by the Khaos Brigade on the Peace Conference.</p><p><br></p><p>Today, I contacted the members of Grayfia Lucifuge’s peerage once more. The request was for healing wounds. I left the injuries I had gotten from sparring and training yesterday just for show.</p><p><br></p><p>One would be surprised how hard it’s to do when you have Phenex Bloodline.</p><p><br></p><p>I was hoping it would be Asia Argento because I was hoping to copy the use of her Twilight Healing Sacred Gear. It was a great tool for healing.</p><p><br></p><p>We tried to make some Phenex Tears, one of the main reasons why I copied the Phenex Bloodline. The process was extremely annoying.</p><p><br></p><p>To make a single tear, we needed to be in a completely neutral emotional state. If there were any emotions when shedding the tear, it would make the tear useless. Sometimes it takes hours to make just one tear.</p><p><br></p><p>It took a lot of tries before I could make even one of them. I kinda understood why it was so pricey and I found a cheat to it later on. Senjutsu included many techniques to empty the mind and when used they help increase the production speed of the Phenex Tears by a lot. It’s just that to reach that level of expertise in Senjutsu is tough. Extremely so.</p><p><br></p><p>Nevertheless, I made a couple of them and gave one to Rias, Kuroka and Xenovia while keeping the last one to me. Surprisingly, both Rias and Kuroka decided to give their Phenex Tears to me to pass on to her peerage and Koneko respectively. Surprisingly, even Xenovia passed on her share for Asia of all people to make up for insulting her. This made me respect that muscle headed girl a bit more.</p><p><br></p><p>As I was thinking of these things, there was a knock on the door and I found a cute blonde girl waiting for me outside the door. “Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm… did you summon a Devil?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>I decided to tease her a little. “I did but I wasn’t expecting an angel. Are you going to punish me, Miss Angel?”</p><p><br></p><p>The girl looked flustered and hurriedly denied. “I-I am not an Angel.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha I was just joking. Don’t mind me. Come on in.” I led her to one of the rooms. “Will you need me to show you the wounds to heal them?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Y-yes. It will be easier and better if you do so.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. Then excuse me.” I opened my shirt and showed my back. There was quite a lot of bruising. I was sparring with Bikou while being restrained under gravity. It was hard. The fact that there were even bruises on my body after so long was already evident of how tough our training was. Bikou was going all out and I was matching him with my physique and Senjutsu alone. This goes to show how long I have come in just a single month.</p><p><br></p><p>She started healing and I observed her Sacred Gear.</p><p><br></p><p>Twilight Healing has the power to go up to B Rank in terms of pure healing. Actually, it was superior in terms of pure healing than even the Sephiroth Graal and that’s saying something.</p><p><br></p><p>Currently Asia has only mastered it up to D Rank which means she still has a lot of way to go.</p><p><br></p><p>I started the copy on the skill while I engaged her in a conversation.</p><p><br></p><p>She really is a very sweet girl. I was even sceptical that there could be such a sweet girl alive. I was so thankful that Diodora was already dead meat.</p><p><br></p><p>This type of person doesn’t deserve any more sadness in her life.</p><p><br></p><p>Even when the Skill was copied, we sat and talked about several things and I gave her a cake I had baked for everyone back home.</p><p><br></p><p>How could those bastards in the church ever throw out someone like her?</p><p><br></p><p>By the time we were ready to leave, I knew I had to do one thing.</p><p><br></p><p>I walked up to her and pinched her cheeks. “You are adorable, Asia.” She looked surprised but I just laughed. ”If anyday, you have any trouble, call me for help and I will help you out. Promise.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah umm, thank you. I… what is your name, SIr?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Me? You can call me big brother. As for my name, I thought Issei would have told you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Issei-san?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I did meet him last time.” I smiled. “My name is Samuel or Sam, whichever you like.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Wha… you are… are Buchou-san and Koneko-chan’s elder sister alright? How did you get hurt? They are not hurt, are they?” She barraged me with a number of questions while rechecking my body once more to see if she left any spot.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha these were just injuries from my training. Don’t worry about these. As for Rias and Kuroka, they are alright. Both of them have sent something for you all. The packet is on the dining table. I actually wanted to inform Rias’ elder brother about something so I had to pretend to call one of you out. I could heal my injuries anytime I wanted.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm, why don’t you all come back? Everyone is so worried.” She asked, hesitantly.</p><p><br></p><p>“This… right now, it’s better we stay outside and do our part to help everyone out. It’s hard but someone has to do it. You all are working hard too. I saw it during the attack on Kokabiel. You all have grown a lot compared to what Rias told me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You were there?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I was. Rias and Kuroka wouldn’t take any risks when it came to you all and we didn’t know if our message was taken seriously so I was there to prevent any mishap. Thankfully, nothing was needed. I am sorry for not intervening in the fight. I couldn’t reveal myself if I could avoid it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I-it’s fine. Thank you for keeping an eye on us.” She bowed as I was amazed at the pure hearted nature of the girl. She didn’t even doubt me for a moment.</p><p><br></p><p>This right here needed to be protected. At any cost.</p><p><br></p><p>I couldn't help but smile at her.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Listen here, Asia.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Yes.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"If you want to get Issei…\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Wha… I'm… it's not like…\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Oh please. Did you forget that I can see the glimpses of the future? Now listen. If you don't want to become only one of many girls in his harem and actually want some time with him, get working. First things first, go and confess.\"</p><p><br></p><p>She was beet red by this point and looked like she would faint anytime.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Sigh</em></p><p><br></p><p>\"Okay, close your eyes.\" I put a hand on her head.</p><p><br></p><p>She followed without any question.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Imagine that in a few years, Issei is married, has cute kids, is living happily\" a smile formed in her face, \"Now imagine that the girl who is married to him is not you. Someone else took the opportunity to confess earlier and got together with him. All you can do is stand on the side and look at them. How would you feel then, Asia?\"</p><p><br></p><p>The reaction from her was not something I imagined. Tears started falling from her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Oh boi, wake up, Asia. Wake up.\" I shook her into the present and wiped her tears. \"Nothing like that has happened. There is still time. You need to grab this chance. For all his shouting about getting a harem, he is actually still traumatised about what that Fallen Angel did to him. So if he doesn't accept it the first time, don't worry. You need to make him understand that you actually love him and that you will not do what happened to him previously. Do this and you will get what you want.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next hour, I gave her some tips about what to do to get that idiot running after her. Before leaving, I left her with my share of a Phenex Tear too.</p><p><br></p><p>I could always make some more for myself again.</p><p><br></p><p>We need to get to the second task now that our work here was done.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Sirzechs -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Another package?” He asked, just to make sure he heard it right.’</p><p><br></p><p>Grayfia nodded. He did notice her disturbed expressions. He will ask her later.</p><p><br></p><p>He took the letters and read the message. It was Rias’ writing without a doubt. He held back a sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>On one hand, he wanted his sister out of that place and back home but as a leader of his race, he couldn’t deny that the work she was doing was extremely important for the entire Devil Race.</p><p><br></p><p>His brows furrowed reading the letter.</p><p><br></p><p>There were slight changes in the plan and even the circumstances and reasons for such a change. True Longinus and Dimension Lost being involved. Not to mention Euclid being alive… It explained Grayfia’s expressions.</p><p><br></p><p>Ophis’ snake and Suicide attacks.</p><p><br></p><p>Using Gasper…</p><p><br></p><p>He turned towards the young bishop Asia, who was sitting beside Issei, surprisingly holding his hand. From the expression of the boy, it seemed as if things had developed between them.</p><p><br></p><p>One time he had thought of matching him with Rias, seeing his feelings for her but as they say about the best laid plans of men and mice…</p><p><br></p><p>At the very least both of them were more relaxed than before.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl looked a bit tense from his gaze.</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t have to look scared. Tell me everything about today’s encounter.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm Sam-san came here to leave information for you because Buchou-san and Kuroka-san were worried. I was called for a task of healing someone and he greeted me at the door of the house. I proceeded to heal him.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What kind of injuries? Were they in some kind of a fight? Is Rias alright?” He questioned.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah yes, Buchou-san is alright. Sam-san just needed a reason to call me for the contract. He said the injuries were from his training. It’s…”</p><p><br></p><p>“What is it?”</p><p><br></p><p>“He was very injured. Bruises and cuts from what seemed to be swords all over his body. He kept those just so he could get an appointment with me without attracting suspicion.”</p><p><br></p><p>That was… quite smart.</p><p><br></p><p>He will need to have Grayfia teach them to assess people before accepting contracts. If Sam can do it then any enemy could do it too.</p><p><br></p><p>“We talked for a while. He said that he was watching the fight with Kokabiel because Kuroka-san and Buchou-san were worried that any of us might get injured if their message was not taken seriously. He didn’t interfere because he sensed the presence of many strong devils.”</p><p><br></p><p>Reasonable.</p><p><br></p><p>“He gave us some gifts from Buchou-san and Kuroka-san and finally…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Finally?”</p><p><br></p><p>The girl blushed. “He asked me to call him big brother and gave me this.”</p><p><br></p><p>She presented him with a vial and he checked it promptly, his eyes widening as he realised what the vial contained.</p><p><br></p><p>“Phenex Tears! What did Rias and Kuroka send?” He asked Grayfia.</p><p><br></p><p>“The same. There were three vials of Phenex Tears apart from this one. The last one was from former exorcist Xenovia Quarta who is recruited by Rias as her knight to Asia Argento apologising for her misbehaviour.” She pointed to the next letter.</p><p><br></p><p>The Durandal Wielder has now joined Rias’ peerage. This was good news.</p><p><br></p><p>But how did they get so many Phenex Tears? His relations with the Phenex House hadn’t gotten any better and they had stopped selling Phenex Tears to him, citing different reasons. Were they selling to the enemies?</p><p><br></p><p>No. If so then they would have reported this.</p><p><br></p><p>Four tears would be worth a LOT.</p><p><br></p><p>Another thing he will have to investigate.</p><p><br></p><p>For now, he had other things to plan for. The Peace Conference was of the utmost importance and he couldn’t afford to mess up.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Sam -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The day of the Peace Conference had come.</p><p><br></p><p>Last week, we ran around like crazy. I practised the spells I had learned and pushed myself to stimulate my bloodlines. It’s crazy how much the increase can be when someone has bloodlines of such high levels.</p><p><br></p><p>My Demonic Power was rising like no one’s business. It was obvious. I had three B Ranked Bloodlines so it would be stranger if my powers didn’t rise.</p><p><br></p><p>All leaders had started gathering here since morning.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka and I had taken three days and dug out some places throughout the entirety of the Kuoh Academy to hide and placed small barriers around the place. Euclid had some great spells.</p><p><br></p><p>The Hero Faction were going to attack today and I wanted to make sure they disband after today’s fight.</p><p><br></p><p>Georg was currently working with the magicians to set up the barrier. His Dimension Lost working overtime to make another dimension where the leaders were supposed to be pulled when Gasper’s powers were activated…</p><p><br></p><p>What the idiot didn’t know was that… I was one of those magicians.</p><p><br></p><p>Copying the magician’s skills and replacing him was easy enough with my powers and disguise.</p><p><br></p><p>Dimension Lost was an amazing piece of Equipment.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>A Ranked Space Magic</strong></p><p><strong>A Ranked Sealing Magic</strong></p><p><strong>A Ranked Barrier Magic</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He had only been able to use it to C Rank right now. One of the reasons why he needed so many magicians to help him establish a barrier strong enough to isolate the leaders.</p><p><br></p><p>But I didn’t have time to copy those right now so I waited till the guy was almost done with setting the barrier.</p><p><br></p><p>All he needed to do was activate his Dimension Lost and drag the leaders in this other dimension and they will be trapped here for a while.</p><p><br></p><p>They were using some kind of devices to set up and strengthen the barrier and members of the Hero Faction were guarding these. Georg was with their newest member Leonardo as he would need to be protected as he created his monsters from a safe place for the attack and Georg could take him and run away easily in case of danger.</p><p><br></p><p>Leonardo was a twelve year old kid. These Hero faction people had forcibly brainwashed tons of Sacred Gear users and pushed them into dangerous situations to get them to awaken their Balance Breakers. They wanted to use this conference to increase their strength so there were other Sacred Gear users too.</p><p><br></p><p>Most of them were only at E or D Rank with only Leonardo being at C.</p><p><br></p><p>I started copying the Annihilation Maker while the kid was asleep.</p><p><br></p><p>Unique objects like the Annihilation Maker cannot be copied but rather stolen. They get transformed into cards which I could keep with myself or even use on others.</p><p><br></p><p>Twenty minutes later, I started Copy on Georg himself who was resting to recover power before the conference started and it was done without any hitch another twenty minutes later.</p><p><br></p><p>Poor Georg didn’t realise this but while he was taking a short nap, he lost his biggest weapon and gave me the control of the entire barrier as well as their lives.</p><p><br></p><p>I quietly slipped by to the next part of my plan.</p><p><br></p><p>________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>The meeting was taking place on the ground floor, Principal’s Office. </p><p><br></p><p>One of my hiding places was prepared two metres below the office so that I could be in range of the leaders.</p><p><br></p><p>The attack was scheduled to take place in a few hours time.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias and Kuroka had infiltrated the magicians tasked with capturing Gasper and will only activate the Sacred Gear when I go there which means that I have just enough time to copy everyone’s cards.</p><p><br></p><p>Looking at the cards in front of me, I couldn’t help but grin. I even used my One Time Multiple Target Card for today.</p><p><br></p><p>Especially since there were several more people in the room than I was expecting due to the upcoming attack.</p><p><br></p><p>Heaven’s side had sent Michael and Gabriel. They had brought Dulio Gesualdo and Vasco freaking Strada as their guards.</p><p><br></p><p>Michael’s Skills were something which would suit the current Leader of Heaven.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>B Ranked Great Seraph Bloodline(Michael)</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Holy Magic</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Light Magic</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Angelic Magic</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Holy Wind Magic</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Wind Magic</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Swordsmanship</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Martial Arts</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Holy Resistance</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Light Resistance</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Holy System Control</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Management</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Tactician </strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Leadership</strong></p><p><br></p><p>There were several other C Ranked Skills and I didn’t even start to count the D Ranked ones and below.</p><p><br></p><p>B Ranked Great Seraph Bloodline.</p><p><br></p><p>Michael was the twin brother of Lucifer so if there is a bloodline closest to his, it would be Michael’s.</p><p><br></p><p>Will my Bloodline get boosted from this?</p><p><br></p><p>The next was Gabriel who had</p><p><br></p><p><strong>B Ranked Great Seraph Bloodline(Gabriel)</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Holy Magic</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Light Magic</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Angelic Magic</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Holy Water Magic</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Water Magic</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Martial Arts</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Holy Resistance</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Light Resistance</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Management</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Politics</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Leadership</strong></p><p><br></p><p>There were different Bloodlines for all Great Seraphs?</p><p><br></p><p>I noticed that Michael’s card was darker in colour which means it was stronger than Gabriel’s. Was it because of his Golden Wings?</p><p><br></p><p>What will happen if I combine all the Great Seraph Bloodlines with my own?</p><p><br></p><p>Only way to know. I started a copy on Gabriel’s Bloodline too.</p><p><br></p><p>Vasco Strada cards made me question if he was even a Human</p><p><br></p><p>Some of his cards were reduced in power due to his age but he had a B Ranked Swordsmanship Skill and a B Ranked Holy Swordsman Skill too.</p><p><br></p><p>This guy was a beast of a human.</p><p><br></p><p>I decided to get the Swordsmanship Skill from him.</p><p><br></p><p>Dulio’s C Ranked Holy magic since stealing his Sacred Gear would cause all kinds of trouble.</p><p><br></p><p>The Fallen Angel side had Azazel and Shemhazai along with Tobio Ikuse and Vali. There was also Fafnir within the Down Fall Dragon Spear in Azazel’s coat.</p><p><br></p><p>Tobio was a scythe wielder which I had no interest in. He was a good user of Senjutsu though. It was a B Ranked Senjutsu Skill. Exactly what I needed too.</p><p><br></p><p>His Dog, Cannis Lykaon, was completely different.</p><p><br></p><p>This Sacred Gear was a combination of both Lykaon and Totska no Tsurugi, the Ame-no-Ohabari, the sword which Izanagi used to kill and chop Hinokagatsuchi into pieces.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>A Ranked Cutting</strong></p><p><strong>A Ranked Divine Flames</strong></p><p><strong>A Ranked Cursed Flames</strong></p><p><strong>A Ranked Shadow Manipulation</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Pack Call</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The A Ranked Cutting Skill was similar to the <strong>A Ranked Severing</strong> which I had copied from Regulus. This was just more spiritual in nature as in it could even attack spirits. It contained the concept of ‘cutting through everything’ which was quite broken. This ability comes from the sword of Izanagi.</p><p><br></p><p>The Divine Flames came from Hinokagutsuchi and could even burn Izanami.</p><p><br></p><p>Which one of these to copy?</p><p><br></p><p>I was very interested in the Flames as well as Cutting.</p><p><br></p><p>Most of my abilities were aligned with swordsmanship or cutting. So I went with <strong>A Ranked Cutting</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>Fafnir had good Skills too.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>B Ranked Golden Dragon’s Bloodline(Fafnir)</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Physique</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Strength</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Endurance</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Outrage</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Agility</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Reflexes</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Dragon Magic</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Fire Magic</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Curse Magic</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Golden Aura</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Magic Resistance</strong></p><p><br></p><p>His abilities were all among the upper B Ranks from the colour of the Cards.</p><p>It was quite close to the A Ranks. I started the copy on the B Ranked Golden Aura which had some nullification abilities.</p><p><br></p><p>Azazel’s Skills were just as varied as Michael’s and Gabriel’s and same for Shemhazai.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>B Ranked Fallen Angel Bloodline(Azazel)</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Light Magic</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Fallen Angelic Magic</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Sealing</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Summoning Magic</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Spearmanship</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Inventor</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Martial Arts</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Magitech</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Light Resistance</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Management</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Politics</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Tactician </strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Leadership</strong></p><p><br></p><p>There were too many good things here. In a way, his skills were more diverse than Michael's, who had been stuck with Heaven’s System all his life while Azazel had drowned himself in studies and research of Sacred Gear.</p><p><br></p><p>As mouth watering as these skills were, I had already decided what to do with Angelic and Fallen Angelic beings.</p><p><br></p><p>Copy Bloodline and merge with the Lucifer Bloodline.</p><p><br></p><p>I am going to pull an Ichigo Kurosaki on the Abrahamic Factions.</p><p><br></p><p>Shemhazai’s skills, while not as impressive as Azazel’s, were still strong.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>B Ranked Fallen Angel Bloodline(Shemhazai)</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Light Magic</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Fallen Angelic Magic</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Martial Arts</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Light Resistance</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Management</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Politics</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Tactician </strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Leadership</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I started the copy on his Bloodline too.</p><p><br></p><p>The Devils were the strongest side in the room.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs, Serafall, Grayfia, Okita Souji and Mcgregor Mathews were present in the room. Apart from them, Sona, Latia Astaroth and their peerage members</p><p><br></p><p>Serafall and Grayfia had almost similar skills. In fact they were almost identical as far as their skills were concerned.</p><p><br></p><p>Serafall had.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>B Ranked Sitri Bloodlines</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Ice Magic</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Demonic Power</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Demonic Power Control</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Barrier Magic</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Devil Magic</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Management</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Politics</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Leadership</strong></p><p><br></p><p>While Grayfia had.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>B Ranked Lucifuge Bloodlines</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Ice Magic</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Demonic Power</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Demonic Power Control</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Barrier Magic</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Devil Magic</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Management</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Politics</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Leadership</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I went for the B Ranked Barrier Magic from Serafall and the B Ranked Demonic Power Control from Grayfia.</p><p><br></p><p>McGregor’s B Ranked Human Magic was his best Skill. I copied it. Same for Souji and his B Ranked Swordsmanship.</p><p><br></p><p>Last but not the least, the elephant in the room, my brother-in-law, Sirzechs Lucifer, the strongest devil alive’s Skills.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs’ cards were not what I was expecting. His cards had a special card similar to the King Piece and Ophis’ Blessing Card. It was named Demonic Mutation. It was basically attached to his Bael Bloodline, raising its level to A Rank.</p><p><br></p><p>I was not expecting something like this at all.</p><p><br></p><p>Did all Super Devils have a genetic mutation?</p><p><br></p><p><strong>A Ranked Demonic Mutation</strong></p><p><strong>A Ranked Bael Bloodline</strong></p><p><strong>E Ranked Gremory Bloodline</strong></p><p><strong>A Ranked Demonic Power</strong></p><p><strong>A Ranked Demonic Power Control</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Barrier Magic</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Devil Magic</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Management</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Politics</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Leadership</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I decided to try and copy this Skill Card. If my guess was correct, then I knew exactly what card to give as a gift to Rias.</p><p><br></p><p>With this thought, I started copying the Demonic Mutation Card.</p><p><br></p><p>As for the other Devils, Latia Astaroth and her Time Control Agares Bloodline is useful so I started copying those. The peerage members were nothing special but every bit counted.</p><p><br></p><p>If this goes well, I will finally have a say in this world.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Rias -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She received a message from Sam on a cellphone. Yes.

She asked me to accompany her after we left from our job. Apparently, she had a lot on her mind and she wanted to take a walk to refresh her mind. I agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>It was almost morning so we didn’t roam around much and returned after an hour or so.</p><p><br></p><p>The first thing I noticed was that the house was empty.</p><p><br></p><p>“Rias must be training in the basement. You can go and wash up. I will cook something after I get her back.”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded and went towards the bath while I went to get Rias back.</p><p><br></p><p>The room was eerily quiet and the scene that I saw when I opened the room chilled my spine.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias lay on the ground, several cuts and bruises on her body. I was by her side before I could realize it myself.</p><p><br></p><p>“Kuroka!” I shouted out loud to let her know that something was wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>Her breathing was shallow and I quickly checked her body, using Senjutsu.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka was by our side in an instant. She quickly teleported us to the bed in the room above us while I used the moment to calm myself.</p><p><br></p><p>I was training to be a doctor.</p><p><br></p><p>I can do this. I just need to be calm. I repeated this to myself in my head quietly.</p><p><br></p><p>Taking a deep breath, I took a look at her body’s conditions in detail.</p><p>There were broken bones as well as some muscles which were torn off, arteries damaged and she was suffering from massive exhaustion.</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly got rid of my clothes. Kuroka knew what I was doing and didn’t question it.</p><p><br></p><p>She removed her clothes and got behind her as well.</p><p><br></p><p>I removed her clothes and Kuroka took the chance to clean her wounds with her magic while I removed the dirt from the bedsheets.</p><p><br></p><p>The skin contact healing method was strong enough to heal a hole in the stomach. Demonic Power was bullshit in more than one aspect. Even a normal devil had a much better healing than a human because of the demonic power flowing through their veins. If she wasn’t exhausted, she would have been up by now.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, she was injured and her injuries were the worst I saw since we started training together.</p><p><br></p><p>Two hours later, her breathing became more stable as the infusion of Demonic Power inside her increased her own dried out reserves.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka dozed off as well but I couldn’t sleep.</p><p><br></p><p>The image of her laying on the ground, unmoving, was flashing in my head whenever I tried to close my eyes.</p><p><br><br></p><p></p><p></p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka left the room after walking up later.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias was still asleep but her vitals were normal now. Her fractures had completely healed up and the muscles were completely reattached. Even the bruises on her skin were completely gone.</p><p><br></p><p>It was eight and a half hours later that she woke up.</p><p><br></p><p>She realized where she was and looked at me quickly getting up. “When did you get back? Did everything go well? You never called so I was worried that something bad might have happened. Are you alright?” She started to check my body.</p><p>The sheer panic and worry in her voice made all the anger I was holding drain. She was just a few steps away from being hysterical.</p><p><br></p><p>I let out a sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am alright, Rias. I couldn’t move from the place. Nothing bad happened. I was just copying one of Issei’s cards. It took a long time and I couldn’t move from the place while it was done.”</p><p><br></p><p>She calmed down a little on hearing this.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why did you train like that, Rias? I remember we agreed that you can only do that training when there is someone to overlook your safety.”</p><p><br></p><p>She deflated a bit on hearing my question and her reply was almost inaudible but with my enhanced hearing I could still hear it.</p><p><br></p><p>“I… wanted to help but… I am too weak. I wanted to change that.”</p><p><br></p><p>Whether she was thinking about today or about the past or both when saying this, I didn’t know but I did know of one thing.</p><p><br></p><p>I needed to get this thought out of her head.</p><p><br></p><p>Guilt can make people do stupid things and I didn’t want her to suffer even more than she already was.</p><p><br></p><p>I made her turn towards me, our faces literally inches apart.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are not weak, Rias. get that thought out of your head.”</p><p><br></p><p>Her eyes widened but then as if a dam which had been holding everything back, it burst out. “I am weak. If I had been strong… I wouldn’t have lost. If I had been strong… Kiba wouldn’t have died. If I had been strong, you wouldn’t have gone there alone and risked your life all by yourself. I couldn’t… I… I couldn’t even do anything but sit here, in this room and worry but not go out there with you because I’d just drag you down. I’m..” Tears pooled at the corner of her eyes as her fingernails dug deep into her palms till they bled.</p><p><br></p><p>I took a deep breath and made her sit directly in front of me. “Okay, then let’s break things down and see it from an outsider’s perspective.”</p><p><br></p><p>She raised her head to face me so I continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“From what I know, you are among the top four strongest Devils of your generation, correct?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sairaorg, Vali and even Kuroka are stronger than me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“All three were forced to grow stronger to survive. Your case is different from theirs. Let’s take a basic example. People living in flood prone areas are forced to learn swimming at a very young age. This doesn’t mean that others who are at the same age are at fault for not knowing how to swim. It’s just a difference of circumstances. They could just learn swimming if they put in some effort. The only reason they haven’t is that they simply never needed to.”</p><p><br></p><p>I might be exaggerating a bit but it was the truth. Maturity doesn’t come with age but with experiences.</p><p><br></p><p>Just because some people were forced to mature at an early age due to less than enviable circumstances, it doesn’t mean that those who are not as mature as them are at fault.</p><p><br></p><p>“But…” She tried to say something but I stopped her.</p><p><br></p><p>“As for the Rating Game and your loss, let’s see it this way. Imagine that you had a loan thrown on your head which you had to repay in ten years.” She looked at me oddly but nodded anyway. “If you can’t then your house gets taken away from you. You worked perfectly despite the unfair loan and predicted that your loan can be repaid in eight or so years. Okay?” She nodded again and I continued. “But the people were eying the house from the very beginning and had no intention of holding their end of the bargain. They pulled the date back to six years all of a sudden. So… is that your fault?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s not like that…”</p><p><br></p><p>“As odd as it sounds… it is. What? Don’t believe me? Okay, give me one reason why?”</p><p><br></p><p>She opened and closed her mouth but no words came out of her mouth.</p><p><br></p><p>“You see, if a first year student was given a final year graduation paper to solve… and he fails the exam, it doesn’t mean that the student was bad or worthless. It just means that the examiner was an utter dickward. The fact that one or two students in the world can solve the said paper in the first year doesn’t mean shit. The world doesn’t run by exceptions. They are not the rule. Get this through your head. You are not to be blamed for any of this. Understood?”</p><p><br></p><p>To be honest, this entire marriage fiasco didn’t make any sense at all.</p><p><br></p><p>Neither did many other things.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, Rias treated Akeno like a sister. The Gremory treated her as a family member and accepted her heritage for <em>years</em> but she still had problems with it while all that was needed for her to accept it was some pep talk by Issei and basically him accepting her?</p><p><br></p><p>I call it plot bullshit. Every girl needed stupid issues to be solved and then the hero got a brainded fangirl. It was ridiculous if one thought of it carefully.</p><p><br></p><p>Many things were odd about the story.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean why would Sirzechs send his beloved sister to fight against Gods and Heavenly Dragon level monsters who have a good chance to defeat him?</p><p><br></p><p>Didn’t the Devils have tons of Ultimate Class people from the Rating Games?</p><p><br></p><p>And yet, miraculously, no one died.</p><p><br></p><p>But this world was different.</p><p><br></p><p>Someone did die in this world. This already meant that whatever I remembered from the story was at best a baseline and I cannot expect the same level for the enemies I faced.</p><p><br></p><p>Also, something about that Boob Goddesses’ Blessing made alarm bells go out in my head. Wasn’t she first introduced in the Loki fight?</p><p><br></p><p>How did he have it at the start?</p><p><br></p><p>The guy himself seemed like a decent guy, so was it the Boob Goddesses’ Blessing making him a nutjob or was that just plain anime logic?</p><p><br></p><p>I shoved these thoughts out of my head and concentrated on the matter at hand.</p><p><br></p><p>She calmed down after some time and I picked her up. She didn’t complain as I took her to the bath.</p><p><br></p><p>We were already naked so we didn’t need to undress.</p><p><br></p><p>Two spells later, the tub was ready. She sat with her back resting on my chest as she leaned back.</p><p><br></p><p>I took a bit of shampoo in my hand and slowly applied it on her long hair.</p><p><br></p><p>Fun fact, she was using a magical hair colour to prevent it from being destroyed in battles. It only came off after a spell and another hair colour remover.</p><p><br></p><p>I saw the black colour of her hair dye get washed away and vapourize as soon as it touched the water in the tub and what was left were the most beautiful locks of crimson hair I had ever seen.</p><p><br></p><p>I continued massaging her hair for some time till she relaxed and grabbed my hands, making me embrace her within.</p><p><br></p><p>“I think I felt some control over my Gremory powers today.” She finally broke the silence.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at her and checked her cards again and sure enough, the Gremory Bloodline was at D Rank now.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. It’s D Rank now. What do you think is the difference?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s not exactly controlling Luck but more like feeling it move really. I am pretty sure if I wasn’t actively thinking of it under the shower of magical bullets, I wouldn’t even have felt it but now, somehow or the other I think I can sense Luck but only when I am in a dangerous situation.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Any ideas on how you managed that?”</p><p><br></p><p>She thought of it for a while and I moved her hair behind her ears as she half turned back to face me. I don’t know why… but the crimson hair made her look beyond anything. I was a bit dazed even when I slept naked with her everyday, and she was currently hugging me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sam.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?” I broke out of my daze at her call?</p><p><br></p><p>“What happened?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Nothing… your hair looks so beautiful that I… Ah…”</p><p><br></p><p>She took a moment to understand what I said and then her cheeks lit up with an atomic blush. Really… this girl is a walking contradiction.</p><p><br></p><p>On one hand, she is fine sleeping naked with me and even jokes about such things while in my arms. But I compliment her or kiss her forehead lightly and she blushes.</p><p><br></p><p>“A-anyways… I… we were talking about my powers.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah yes. We were talking…”</p><p><br></p><p>We moved on to the topic of discussion to avoid the awkward moment.</p><p><br></p><p>She took a deep breath and continued. “I think I could feel it when I gave up all resistance to the attacks and just let whatever happened happen. The more I tried to control or <em>willed</em> it to happen, the less there was an effect. But when I let everything go, I could feel something. I noticed that the attacks on me had become much less and the bullets were hitting each other more, being dispersed before they hit my body.”</p><p><br></p><p>\"Have you decided which Skill to get for yourself?\" I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>The function of the C Ranked System was the Skill Bestowal function. With this, I can bestow only one Skill to anyone. The card which I bestow will forever be lost from my collection and I won't be able to just copy the Skill again from the one bestowed.</p><p><br></p><p>This function was very restricted and not exactly a way to make someone much stronger instantly but it was still a reasonable growth.</p><p><br></p><p>I still haven't tested this on anyone.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I think it would be best if you could get A Or S Ranked Demonic Power Reserves because the natural limit of the Devil Race is limited by their Demonic Power. I will need to check and see if there are any side effects to this power which we don't know of.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hmm.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Sam.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Yes.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I want you to copy the Phenex Bloodline.\"</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>\"What?\" I asked, fearing as if I misheard something.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I want you to copy the Phenex Bloodline.\" She repeated.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Why?\"</p><p><br></p><p>She let out a sigh. \"As much as I dislike them, it doesn't change the fact that they have a power which can increase your survivability by a lot. I… I don't want to risk your life for my pride.We are already fugitives, ”</p><p><br></p><p>Some quietness settled down in the bath and I spoke after a few minutes. “Okay.”</p><p><br></p><p>We didn’t speak much and got out of our baths quietly.</p><p><br></p><p>Today was exhausting</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Sirzechs -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He rushed to the human world as soon as he could when Grayfia suddenly called about some information about Rias.</p><p><br></p><p>It had been a month and a half and even Ajuka working several weeks couldn’t find a trace of her.</p><p><br></p><p>As he opened the room, he saw the peerage members of Rias gathered along with Grayfia.</p><p><br></p><p>He had ordered them to be brought so that his father couldn’t track them. He didn’t need another drama at this time.</p><p><br></p><p>The people in the room were extremely tense. He saw the Pawn look especially tense, even lost.</p><p><br></p><p>The one who however worried him was the Rook. He hadn’t seen her like that in years since he had rescued her from being executed.</p><p><br></p><p>She was shivering in place and was almost curled up in a ball with only the support of Akeno and the bishop to stay in the room.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Tell me exactly what happened.\"</p><p><br></p><p>The pawn retold what happened in the last pact and every word the guy called Samuel has said.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at Grayfia and she handed him the package. It was without a doubt Rias' handwriting. It was the things that were written inside which were the cause of his concern. At least it explained why Koneko was acting like this.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Did you check the facts? The hair clip?\" He asked and Grayfia nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>Naberius.</p><p><br></p><p>He did think there was something fishy about that execution, which is why he stopped it. But even as a Satan, there was a limit to how much he could probe.</p><p><br></p><p>The Naberius had lost a child and then treating them as the suspects would have only raised the ire of the Devils against him and the Satans so the most he could do was save Koneko from the execution.</p><p><br></p><p>And looks like that act saved Rias' life now. She was saved and helped by Kuroka.</p><p><br></p><p>The main cause of concern was this Sam or rather what he had predicted.</p><p><br></p><p>A Seer was rare.</p><p><br></p><p>True ones were even rarer.</p><p><br></p><p>One who could predict <em>this</em>, was even rarer than a Longinus. Knowing the future, even just a probable one, was nothing less than a miracle.</p><p><br></p><p>It was just the content of these predictions…</p><p><br></p><p>As for the veracity of the news, he will have to check everything.</p><p><br></p><p>Still… Rias was undercover in a terrorist organisation. He wanted to run up to her and bring her back at the very instant but he knew how stubborn his sister was and… She didn't say where the organisation was.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Lucifer-sama, Buchou, is she alright?\" Issei asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Poor boy had been raked by the guilt of Kiba's death all this time.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias leaving just increased the guilt even more.</p><p><br></p><p>Not only him but all her peerage members. Koneko had become quieter and vented her frustrations in training. Gasper had almost stopped responding to people and only Koneko or Akeno could get him to talk.</p><p><br></p><p>As for Akeno, he sighed…</p><p><br></p><p>\"Yes. She is alright.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Then Sam-san was…\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"He seems to be someone whom Rias saved recently when she found him dying. She needed to use all her… pawn pieces on him to reincarnate him.\"</p><p><br></p><p>He saw the look of hurt on his face and said, \"I am sorry about…\"</p><p><br></p><p>The boy however shook his head. \"No… Buchou is not the kind of person who will let someone die just like that in front of her. She did what needed to be done… Sam-san seemed like a very good person and he will be by Buchou's side so that she isn't alone wherever she is now. It's fine. This…\"</p><p><br></p><p>The bishop came to his side and tightly hugged him.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Koneko.\"</p><p><br></p><p>The girl looked up to him, showing more emotions in her eyes than she did in the past years.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I will make it so that Kuroka can come back to the Underworld and have her name cleared. She is already doing a lot of work to help us by spying on a dangerous terrorist organisation. Such merits will not go unrewarded. As for the Naberius, don't bother about them. I will take care of everything.\" He spoke, his voice firm as steel.</p><p><br></p><p>And he knew exactly what to do. If even half the information in this paper was true, he would be able to see everything through.</p><p><br></p><p>First things first though, he needed to talk to his fellow Satans and verify the news, maybe starting with Diodora Astaroth.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl in question simply looked without any movement.</p><p><br></p><p>He then remembered the threat to Kuoh.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Grayfia, start training everyone. You can put aside all your duties except Milicas to concentrate on their training. We might have a very big danger to our lives soon.\"</p><p><br></p><p><strong>– Sam –</strong></p><p><br></p><p>\"Just so you know, I'm not the type to go for cliches.say for instance you were in love with me and some other girl was making moves on me. If you, out of jealousy, were to inflict some unjust violence on me. I would fight back with no hesitation. I'm the guy who does what he has to do. You'd do well to remember that.\"</p><p><br><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>I finally couldn't take it and burst out laughing while Rias was already having a hard time controlling her giggles.</p><p><br></p><p>Things were getting very stressful so I decided that we should take a break from our training.</p><p><br></p><p>And what better way to relax than some good old anime.</p><p><br></p><p>I chose Konosuba for this occasion. But, there was a small problem.</p><p><br></p><p>There was no Konosuba in this world. So I found a solution and used Illusions to project the show in front of us. And just like that, I was chilling under the bedsheets and laughing my guts out watching one of my favourite anime.</p><p><br></p><p>\"This world is so funny.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I agree. I wonder if it's real.\" She looked at me oddly. \"I mean, this world was an anime as well and you know…\"</p><p><br></p><p>She looked a bit dazed but then snuggled closer to me. \"If so, then one day I would like to visit there. Will you take me?\"</p><p><br></p><p>Her eyes were looking towards the screen but the grip in her fingers told me that it was not a simple question. \"I would love to visit there with you someday.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Although not direct, her lips lightly curved into a smile and she rested her cheeks on my chest. \"I will hold you to this then.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Okay.\"</p><p><br></p><p>The episode finished and we got up to plan for our next stage of action.</p><p><br></p><p>\"There are a few ways to get close enough to copy the Phenex Bloodline. First will be to get one of their summoning flyers but the contracts are mostly handled by the servants so the chance to encounter them is quite difficult.\"</p><p><br></p><p>I agreed. Normally, Kings didn't make contracts until the task was beyond the servants. So getting a King will be difficult.</p><p><br></p><p>\"The second will be to temporarily kidnap the members of the Phenex house but we are not doing that.\"</p><p><br></p><p>I agree.</p><p><br></p><p>\"How about I sneak into the TV station owned by their second son as an employee and copy his bloodline before leaving?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Good plan.\" She thought for some time. \"Although the security of the building is strong, it's not exactly impossible. Not to mention that the second Phenex is not exactly a fighter. Even his peerage is business focused. We just have to look for a good opportunity.\"</p><p><br></p><p>I just thought of another method. \"Can we get access to the Rating Game stadiums?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"No. Don't even think about that. The ones ranked from one to ten are extremely strong, not to mention their experiences in combat and magic. They also have strong peerages and it can be very difficult to get past them.\" She directly rejected the plan and I agreed. Going after the eldest Phenex was dangerous.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Okay. I think we should concentrate on what we have for now. Your Gremory and my Lucifer Bloodline. Just these two bloodlines have enormous potential. I can always copy from others during our visits to the Khaos Brigade. They still have many people whom I can take new Skills from. There are also the places which Vali is planning on going to soon.\"</p><p><br></p><p></p><p></p><p><br></p><p>Three weeks have passed.</p><p><br></p><p>The news about the thefts of the Excalibur swords were mostly hidden but we still found out about it.</p><p><br></p><p>In this time, all I did was train till there was no energy left in my body only to heal myself along with Rias.</p><p><br></p><p>Twice we went to the Khaos Brigade headquarters and got a chance to snip something cool.</p><p><br></p><p>Two things. First was the Angelic Bloodline which was a rarity but we found a High Class Angel whom I could copy.</p><p><br></p><p>I was thinking about something and wanted to see if my theory was correct.</p><p><br></p><p>Lucifer was originally an angel so a part of him must have some angelic side.</p><p><br></p><p>And it was true. The bloodline evolved to C Rank instantly and that's when my Demonic Power started to rise. In the next three days, my Demonic Power rose like no ones' business and training just pushed my reserves even more.</p><p><br></p><p>Currently I was almost at the B Rank in Demonic Power Reserves, at least.</p><p><br></p><p>And it is still growing.</p><p><br></p><p>Another thing I gained was the Holy Magic and it stayed due to the Angelic side. But it was not pure Holy Magic but rather, Holy Demonic Magic.</p><p><br></p><p>This was my first B Ranked Skill.</p><p><br></p><p>The Demonic Brilliance of Evil Light was strong, broken even, I agree but, if mixed with the Holy Demonic attribute, it is something else completely.</p><p><br></p><p>My Skills looked something like this.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>S Ranked Luck</strong></p><p><strong>B Ranked Holy Demonic Magic</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Lucifer Bloodline</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Demonic Power</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Enhanced Physique</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Magic Resistance</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Swordsmanship</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Touki</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Senjutsu</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked General Human Magic</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Curse Magic</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Elemental Magic(Human)</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Light Resistance</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Holy Resistance</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Light Magic</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Enhanced Reflexes</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Enhanced Strength</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Enhanced Endurance</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Enhanced Speed</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Which allowed me to stand up somewhere in this world.</p><p><br></p><p>The gap between Ultimate Class and Satan class is immense.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean, even within the Rating Game players, only the likes of Tannin and Diehauser are proper Satan Class beings.</p><p><br></p><p>So, B Rank was a big deal. Today was the day I finally decided to go after the second Phenex son to copy the Phenex Bloodline.</p><p><br></p><p>He was conducting a show in the Underworld to know about the public opinion on who was the public favourite to win the upcoming Youth Devil Gathering in the next three months. Yes, there was that.</p><p><br></p><p>This year Rias will not be participating and neither will any of her or rather Grayfia's peerage members as she is already an experienced devil.</p><p><br></p><p>There were several reasons behind this decision too. First was my safety, undoubtedly. The second was the ability to make Phenex Tears.</p><p><br></p><p>Those things were a spare life each and were notoriously difficult to come by. If we could get the ability to make them ourselves, our side would have a great boon.</p><p><br></p><p>Not to mention, there was the ability to train the power to get to higher ranks for me.</p><p><br></p><p>We still haven't heard anything from the informants about the situation of the Excalibur swords or about Kokabiel.</p><p><br></p><p>“I’m ready.” Rias got up beside me.</p><p><br></p><p>While we still didn’t use the Bestowal Skill on her, she did grow quite well in these last three weeks.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>D Ranked Demonic Power</strong></p><p><strong>D Ranked Demonic Power Control</strong></p><p><strong>D Ranked Gremory Bloodline</strong></p><p><strong>D Ranked Bael Bloodline</strong></p><p><strong>E Ranked Cooking</strong></p><p><strong>D Ranked Mind Magic</strong></p><p><strong>E Ranked Barrier Magic</strong></p><p><strong>D Ranked Disguise</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Luck</strong></p><p><strong>D Ranked Devil Magic</strong></p><p><br></p><p>All of her Skill Cards were the deepest colour they could be which meant that they were ready to get to the next level soon. Currently, she is at the Peak of a High Class Devil.</p><p><br></p><p>For an estimate, she was almost thrice as strong as she was when I first met her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s go.”</p><p><br></p><p>We teleported from the house.</p><p><br><br></p><p></p><p></p><p><br></p><p>The event was bigger than we had expected.</p><p><br></p><p>We had already planned everything, from who we are going to disguise ourselves as journalists who came to cover the event.</p><p><br></p><p>For this, we had observed two reporters for a week, their actions, found out their information and finally kinda… ughh, invited them for a stay.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is the event for the Youth Devil Gathering so big every year?” I asked Rias as I looked around me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Devils have a very low probability to have children so there wouldn’t be that many young devils of the same age. Normally it’s only a few people from distant branches gathering together every decade or so. This year however, things are different. First of all, there will be the Heirs and Heiresses of many prominent Pillar Houses participating in the gathering. Not to mention…” She grew a bit quiet before continuing. “The Phenex House spent a lot of money to call for the experts of Rating Games to make this event grander and take the attention of the public from my absence. The entire thing took a toll on their popularity even though they used their money to cover up for most of it, there were still voices.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So they organised a giant concert and will try to pretend that nothing happened.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Basically yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>I kinda wanted to mess with them a bit.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t even think about it. We just need to get what we want and leave. Nothing else.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay.” I relented.</p><p><br></p><p>I was not strong enough to take them on yet. Maybe when I am at S Rank, I would give them a public talk in front of the whole underworld.</p><p><br></p><p>We went with the crowd of reporters after having our IDs scanned and took place at the front row.</p><p><br></p><p>I even <em>suggested</em> another journalist to switch places with me so that I was in close proximity with the stage itself.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias on the other hand went back to find something for me.</p><p><br></p><p>The event started with the second son of the Phenex House, Reven Phenex taking stage. He was the owner of his own TV station and an accomplished businessman and from what I can see through my scan, a good fighter as well.</p><p><br></p><p>C Ranked Phenex Bloodline, C Ranked Devil Magic.</p><p><br></p><p>It’s just that the stage was too big and I couldn’ get in range.</p><p><br></p><p>Do I really have to use it?</p><p><br></p><p>The Card I got from the C Rank Promotion was a card which let me extend my range to double of my current range for a day.</p><p><br></p><p>But I am too reluctant to use this.</p><p><br></p><p>I had much better events in mind when I could use this card in tandem with the other two cards. Today it would be a waste to use it.</p><p><br></p><p>As I was thinking of this, I saw some people murmuring and looked towards the side. Three seats from me, a girl with pink dress and blonde drill-like hair sat down with another thug looking guy beside her with the same blond hair and blue eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t need the words of the nearby people to tell me who they were.</p><p><br></p><p>Riser Phenex hadn’t been out in the public much after the entire engagement debacle.</p><p><br></p><p>The fact that he showed up today was already surprising.</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly used Scan and found the results quite surprising because at his current level, Rias would totally blast him out in a straight fight. He was only slightly stronger than the Rias I met a month ago in terms of basic stats. Although she had been training for about a month since running away from her home, he was two years or so older.</p><p><br></p><p>None of his stats are at C Rank.</p><p><br></p><p>I checked his sister’s stats and D Ranked Phenex Bloodline and E Ranked Devil magic.</p><p><br></p><p>The Phenex Tears were made through a certain ritual which was kept a secret by the Phenex House. This Ritual must be inside the Devil Magic part.</p><p><br></p><p>I set up the copy for the Phenex Bloodline first from Ravel as I didn’t know if she knew how to make Phenex Tears. Five minutes later, I copied the Devil Magic from Riser and both the required Skills for the production of Phenex Tears were with me.</p><p><br></p><p>The surprising part was the guests in the event.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean Ruval Phenex was a given but the others were the more impressive ones.</p><p><br></p><p>Rudiger Rosenkreutz, Roygun Belphegor and finally, Diehauser Belial.</p><p><br></p><p>They stepped on the stage from the stairs near me and I could see their Cards for a moment.</p><p><br></p><p>Rudiger had a B Ranked Human Magic, B ranked Devil Magic and B Ranked Demonic Power control were his best cards.</p><p><br></p><p>Diehauser was a fucking beast.</p><p><br></p><p>The most prominent were the B ranked Belial Bloodline, B Ranked Demonic Power Reserves, B Ranked Demonic Power Control, B Ranked Devil Magic, B Ranked Strategist and the rest were all high C Rank.</p><p><br></p><p>This fucking beast. I didn’t know the man myself but just looking at the cards he had, I was feeling a genuine burst of respect for him.</p><p><br></p><p>He wasn’t born with abnormal gifts like Ajuka or Sirzechs. He trained to this point even when his family could barely afford to support him.</p><p><br></p><p>This requires talent, dedication but most of all hard work and will.</p><p><br></p><p>He deserves the respect.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally was the last member.</p><p><br></p><p>Her cards…</p><p><br></p><p>They were a bit weird.</p><p><br></p><p>It was like Diodora’s cards with Ophis’ blessings. Her cards were connected to another card. A B Ranked King Piece Card which basically boosted the effects of the other cards to a higher level.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a drawback of it not being usable for those with an already existing Evil Piece or beyond a certain level of power.</p><p><br></p><p>There was her ability of Crack though.</p><p><br></p><p>The ability to create a tear on anything.</p><p><br></p><p>Too bad, none of them were close to me when they sat down.</p><p><br></p><p>A few minutes later, I felt my phone vibrate and saw that Rias found something so I excused myself away from the seat to get to her.</p><p><br></p><p>To my surprise, she was waiting near the stairs. When I reached there, she led me to a place. It took me a second to realise that we were right below the stage.</p><p><br></p><p>I flew up and reached near the ceiling and called out scan and to my surprise, cards popped up in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did it work?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>I gave her a thumbs up. “You are a genius.” I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will make a place for us to hide. You start copying.”</p><p><br></p><p>This place was off limits for those not from the staff and so we needed to hide till I was done copying Skills.</p><p><br></p><p>And we did just that. I started with Diehauser’s Belial Bloodline. Worthless is a worthwhile ability. Pun totally intended.</p><p><br></p><p>One hour for one card.</p><p><br></p><p>Sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>The event was scheduled for three hours so I couldn’t copy from everyone.</p><p><br></p><p>My two targets were Diehauser and Rudiger. The Devil Magic from the second guy.</p><p><br></p><p>“How much time?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will need around three hours or so for everything but we don’t have that much time so I’ll just have to choose. Do you think we can wait?”</p><p><br></p><p>This was the store room, so there was a chance that people could come here.</p><p><br></p><p>“I’ll try.”</p><p><br></p><p>She moved the boxes in the room so that there was a tower of sorts around the spot where I was standing. “Creating a barrier might attract the attention of others. It’s best if we avoid it.”</p><p><br></p><p>Reasonable.</p><p><br></p><p>She came up to the top box near me and sat down and silence descended as we listened to the opinions of the people in the auditorium.</p><p><br></p><p>One particular announcement made her clench her hands with anger and I pulled her into a half hug to calm her down.</p><p><br></p><p>“He will lose.” I said.</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded lightly.</p><p><br></p><p>Apparently, Riser Phenex was participating in the Youth Devil Gathering.</p><p><br></p><p>I realised that in the story, he was beaten and traumatised so not able to participate in the Youth Devil gathering.</p><p><br></p><p>He was less than five years older than Rias and was thus allowed to participate in the gathering too.</p><p><br></p><p>The Phenex will want him to win the gathering to wash away a bit of the bad publicity. Devils respected strength, and the strength being of a pure blooded devil will be lapped up quickly by those old devils in the council.</p><p><br></p><p>Too bad for him, there was Sairaorg and he was bound to lose.</p><p><br></p><p>The only reason Sairaorg even lost was the fucking plot.</p><p><br></p><p>The next hour and a half were spent quietly and I got Diehauser’s Belial Bloodline and started on Rudiger’s Devil Magic.</p><p><br></p><p>It was then we heard the door opening. The one who came in was a black haired, purple eyed, muscular guy who entered the room. He was followed by a blonde haired girl who looked at him worried. “A fight here will not change anything, Sai. You will get the chance to fight him in the Rating Game and you can do whatever you want there.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I know but it’s… so infuriating. She was supposed to participate in this tournament and because of him…” The guy took a few deep breaths before calming himself down. “And he has the gall to just stand there and behave as if it has nothing to do with him.”</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t need any more words to know who he was. Sairaorg Bael.</p><p><br></p><p>Beside me Rias shook a little and that was enough for the guy to look in our direction even when we were hidden by the tower of boxes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Who’s there? Come out.”</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly thought of something and dishevelled Rias’ hair and my own and crumpled our clothes before slowly moving the boxes with a light annoyed look. “The room’s already taken. Look for your own room. We’re busy.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Apparently none of the ones present had thought of this response.</p><p><br></p><p>The girls became beet red while the other guy looked a little bewildered but quickly caught hold of himself.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s a bit uncouth to eavesdrop on someone’s conversation, don’t you think.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. I guess. Still less than walking in on the private time of others.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You are not allowed to do… t-that on work in the first place.” The girl interjected.</p><p><br></p><p>“We are on a break. Moreover this is a staff only area. You are intruding. Please leave the premises.”</p><p><br></p><p>I was just stalling at this point. I needed fifteen more minutes to copy the Skill. There was no way I was moving from this place. The Belial Bloodline works best when the person has the knowledge of the opponent’s magic first. I needed Rudiger’s card to efficiently be able to use his abilities.</p><p><br></p><p>“You…” Sairaorg was angry. The guy was frustrated but I couldn’t move from the place and him making a move was not something I could just take sitting in this place.</p><p><br></p><p>“What’s your name? Do you know who we are? Call your superior. We want to talk to them.” The girl put a hand on his shoulder and stopped him before he attacked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sam please.” Rias held my arm and whispered.</p><p><br></p><p>I sighed. And we were so close too. Dammit. I don’t want to give up the skill that easily.</p><p><br></p><p>So, I thought of another plan and while risky I looked at the guy. “I know who you are. Well the guy at least. You’ll be surprised how much I know actually.” I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! And what do you know about me that I will be surprised about?” he asked me challengingly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, let’s say for one, I know quite a few things. For example, you are an expert in physical skills, the names of your peerage members, their powers…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Half the underworld knows of them.” He waved his hands airily.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh? Half the underworld knows of the little cat in your peerage? My my, I was pretty sure that it was your trump card. The big bad cat that can scare the crap out of the Greeks. What was his name? Rigurd? Sirius? Taurus? Well, you get the idea, don't you?” I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>His eyes narrowed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Now if that wasn’t enough, I know that your mother has been a victim of the Sleeping Disease. True.”</p><p><br></p><p>He clenched his fists lightly and his aura got restrained. He was in fight mode. I knew of this feeling. It was when Bikou truly attacked me in our spars. He gives off a similar feeling. Time to stop playing around.</p><p><br></p><p>Eight minutes left.</p><p><br></p><p>“I just happen to know about the only person yet who has awakened from a hundred years or so of long sleep.” I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>He froze.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl beside him stopped too.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias gripped my hand tighter not knowing where I was going with this.</p><p><br></p><p>He took a deep breath and looked at me much calmer this time. “What do you want?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Now, we are speaking.” I clapped my hands.</p><p><br></p><p>“First thing. I will tell you about the person and how they woke up. Whether you can recreate it or not is not my problem.”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded so I continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“As for my price, there will be two things. First, you leave us alone for today and second, I just happened to hear something really interesting a few minutes ago. You are planning to beat the crap out of a supposedly unkillable cockroach. I want in.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sam!” Rias grabbed my hand, a look of worry on her face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you think I will lose?” I asked her, looking straight into her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“You will be in danger and I don’t want you to be in danger. Not for this.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The games will start in three months. I can mop the floor with him and his entire peerage right at this instant.”</p><p><br></p><p>“There will be many others. If you make a move, they will come after you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And that wouldn’t change anything. We will just be where we are now. If I want to leave, they will never… ever find me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And neither will beating him up change anything.” She argued.</p><p><br></p><p>“It will. First of all, I will not allow that bastard to strut around enjoying his life while you suffer from nightmares every night. I will make sure that every time he closes his eyes, he will remember the beating I give him.”</p><p><br></p><p>In this last month we had grown very close. Being the only other person in the world you can trust completely does things for your mind. In essence it was two hurt and lost people coming together to fill the holes in each other.</p><p><br></p><p>So when I see her waking up from her nightmares, it makes my freaking blood boil in anger.</p><p><br></p><p>That Phenex bastard needs a good smacking.</p><p><br></p><p>“Your nightmares… I will stop them. If that takes me beating the crap out of the entire Phenex peerage in front of the underworld, I will.”</p><p><br></p><p>The entire room had become quiet.</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t say anything but I actually felt something on the back of my palm. A teardrop.</p><p><br></p><p>She was crying.</p><p><br></p><p>I lightly hugged her. “Three months later, if you think I am not ready for this, I will stop but just let me do this. Please.”</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t stop me again.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Sairaorg and continued, “So, what do you say?”</p><p><br></p><p>He was however not looking at me but at Rias. The dumbass must have realised who she was. He was about to say something but I pulled her tighter into my embrace and shook my head towards him.</p><p><br></p><p>“How can I trust you?” He asked. I did hear the real reason behind his question. He was not asking about the deal but about leaving her with me.</p><p><br></p><p>“It doesn’t matter if you trust me or not. I don’t yearn for your approval. The only person whose approval I need right now is in my arms. And as long as she wants to, I will take her away. And you won’t be able to stop us.”</p><p><br></p><p>I made a fist in front of my body as my Touki covered the fist and concentrated around it, swirling around.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl whose name I still didn’t know created some black coloured balls of energy to defend them from any possible attack. Hole. Oh, she’s the Queen, Kuisha Abbadon.</p><p><br></p><p>Just in time, the second Card was copied.</p><p><br></p><p>He stepped in front of her. “Then show me your strength.”</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah… I knew this was going to happen.</p><p><br></p><p>Just my luck.</p><p><br></p><p></p><p></p><p><br></p><p>We left the room after an hour, right before the event was about to end. In this time, I was able to copy Ruval Phenex’s Bloodline too, boosting my Phenex Bloodline to C Rank instantly. The Card from his second brother made the Skill finally take a leap from the C to the B Rank.</p><p><br></p><p>And the last was Roygun’s ability which only took twenty minutes to copy because it was originally at the start of the C Rank only.</p><p><br></p><p>Crack. The ability to create a tear in anything.</p><p><br></p><p>The perfect ability to go with my swordsmanship.</p><p><br></p><p>Today’s harvest was beyond anything I came here thinking of. A surprising thing was that with the B Ranked Devil Magic and B Ranked Bloodlines, my overall fighting ability was now at B Rank too….barely . I was finally a Satan Class being.</p><p><br></p><p>Things will only get harder from this point.</p><p><br></p><p>People with A Ranked Skills are hard to find.</p><p><br></p><p>Not to mention, spending three hours with them in a five metre range will be hard.</p><p><br></p><p>The Card I got from the level up was worth it though.</p><p><br></p><p>A Card which allowed me to reset the counter on any person. It meant that whether I copy or bestow, I can do it two times on the same person.</p><p><br></p><p>The best possible use would be to use this on S Ranked beings.</p><p><br></p><p>With some work, I can see Ophis agreeing to sit still for eighteen hours next to me.</p><p><br></p><p>I followed Sairaorg and Rias and Kuisha came behind us.</p><p><br></p><p>The crowd was gathering around the place to surround Sairaorg. We were under disguises so we weren’t noticed much.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mr. Bael, in the show just now, Riser Phenex has claimed that he will take the first place in the Youth Devil Gathering. As the public favourite, what do you have to say to him?” A reporter asked Sairaorg who was in a very bad mood right now.</p><p><br></p><p>As I expected, he replied in a snarky tone completely different from the normal one. “Did he say which of my peerage members he is planning to take hostage or which one to kill to make me surrender?”</p><p><br></p><p>The reporter didn’t expect this line reply and was stunned into silence.</p><p><br></p><p>But this was enough to fuel the other reporters for further questions. “Are you referring to the controversial fight between Riser Phenex and the now missing Rias Gremory? Do you disagree with the fight?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you saying that it was not an accident and he murdered her peerage member deliberately?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ten minutes of ‘Quit or I will kill your peerage members’ followed by the action doesn’t make it a secret. If that’s the case, then I can also say that ‘I will neuter him in the fight’. The winner will be decided when we fight. As for the accidents, they can happen anytime. I am sure that the Phenex House will not be hypocritical and blame me.”</p><p><br></p><p>We didn’t stop for anyone else and left the place directly.</p><p><br></p><p>Oh, this will cause some trouble for the Phenex House… and I love it.</p><p><br></p><p>I had three months to become a Super Devil at the very least.</p><p><br></p><p>I really needed to think of a good plan.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>– Sirzechs –</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He waited in one of the houses in Kuoh. The members of his peerage waited in different places throughout the town.</p><p><br></p><p>The news of the theft of the Excalibur swords were not hard to find when he knew what he was looking for.</p><p><br></p><p>Almost every bit of information he found on the letter was true.</p><p><br></p><p>He had asked Ajuka about the case with his cousin and found that the members of his peerage were indeed only nuns and holy maidens. This was enough to set off alarm bells in Ajuka's mind.</p><p><br></p><p>He kept an eye on him and arrived right on time when he was about to kill the Glasya-Labolas heir and arrested him.</p><p><br></p><p>This followed by the verification of several other things like the scam of the Rating Game, death of Cleria Belial, etc, all proved that the contents of the letter were true.</p><p><br></p><p>The information from Diodora also confirmed many of the things.</p><p><br></p><p>Falbium had been one step from killing Diodora for the attempted murder of his brother but only stopped because they still needed to extract information from him.</p><p><br></p><p>Officially, Diodora Astaroth had gone <em>missing</em>.</p><p><br></p><p>Latia Astaroth was made the temporary heiress of the House till he was found.</p><p><br></p><p>This led them to take the news about Kokabiel's attack seriously.</p><p><br></p><p>Just in case, Ajuka sent Latia Astaroth as the second king of Kuoh to act as bait.</p><p><br></p><p>Serafall had been livid and wanted to come here by herself but was only stopped because she needed to meet with Azazel and Michael to discuss the Peace Treaty.</p><p><br></p><p>The Treaty was already underway and they just needed a last push to convince their people to go along with this. News of the treaty however was top secret.</p><p><br></p><p>It was for this reason that he even entertained the idea of Samuel White being a seer for a moment.</p><p><br></p><p>As the leader of a faction, he really wanted to get him under his wing as soon as possible but as a brother, he was reluctant to take away the only support his sister had at this moment.</p><p><br></p><p>This doesn't mean that he was comfortable with the idea of her spying among dangerous criminals each of whom wanted his head.</p><p><br></p><p>He will have to check and see for himself what kind of person this Sam guy was.</p><p><br></p><p>As for the members of Rias' peerage. Damon Glasya-Labolas had been quite grateful for the help and had agreed to temporarily use them instead of his own members on the Youth Devil Gathering.</p><p><br></p><p>If they win, their standings will improve a lot in the Underworld.</p><p><br></p><p>If Rias was working for the safety and welfare of her peerage members, then he will make sure they are taken care of.</p><p><br></p><p>The sound of an explosion outside and he got up from his seat. Grayfia was already moving but all they did was hide, not interfere.</p><p><br></p><p>It was time for Azazel to keep his side of the bargain.</p><p><br></p><p>– Sam –</p><p><br></p><p>I stood in the middle of nowhere in the Underworld with Sairaorg standing against me. Beside him was an orange haired figure who backed away till only the two of us were left in the field staring straight at each other.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I will not hold back.\" He said seriously.</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded. \"I would be insulted if you did.\"</p><p><br></p><p>To be honest, he was already a C Rank in comprehensive fighting ability.</p><p><br></p><p>His cards were similar to Bikou for Touki and Physique which was saying a lot.</p><p><br></p><p>That monkey was often unassuming but he was ridiculously tough. He shrugged off my normal hits without flinching much which was saying something.</p><p><br></p><p>I got a sword from Arthur to use in the meantime. It wasn't a named sword but it did work.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuisha Abbadon was acting as a referee for the match.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Ready, Start.\"</p><p><br></p><p>We kicked the ground at the same time and punched straight to get a feel of each other.</p><p><br></p><p>He was strong. My brute strength was slightly higher but not by too much.</p><p><br></p><p>I was not going to win against him in hand to hand combat so I didn't even try. My demonic power flowed into my sword as it took on a silver glow.</p><p><br></p><p>I slashed and he dodged as touki covered his body and he spun on the ground and punched straight towards my face.</p><p><br></p><p>I kicked the ground and twisted my body to avoid the hit, covering my own body with Touki to defend myself.</p><p><br></p><p>My senjutsu sensed the area behind me being destroyed by the sheer force of the punch. Even a high class devil would be out by that.</p><p><br></p><p>I slashed down on his body as he brought his other arm covered in a thick layer of Touki to defend.</p><p><br></p><p>My sword sliced through most of it but he still defended enough to send a knee towards my stomach.</p><p><br></p><p>I increased my demonic power in the sword. He realised this and quickly stepped back to avoid his arm being lopped off.</p><p><br></p><p>What took place after that was intense clashes of fists and swords all over the place. Each punch I dodged dug trenches through the ground and each slash of my sword he dodged cut the land in two.</p><p><br></p><p>I was too lost in the fight to realise the time. We both jumped back to create a distance between us.</p><p><br></p><p>I still didn't use any magic except fire attribute swordsmanship.</p><p><br></p><p>\"You should stop holding back… or you will die.\" He said. \"Balance Breaker.\"</p><p><br></p><p>A golden light enveloped him and when the light subsided, he was covered in a golden armour with a lion's head in front of his chest area.</p><p><br></p><p>His aura had increased a lot and the axe in his hand was giving me a feeling of danger but… I am still stronger.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Okay then, try to survive.\"</p><p><br></p><p>I let go of the sword because my next move would make it useless. I took a stance and light flickered in between my hands.</p><p><br></p><p>Black light twisted to form a sword of energy.</p><p><br></p><p>The Demonic Brilliance of Evil Light Sword.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>– Sairaorg Bael –</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Today had been a rough day even by his standards. First that bullshit they were trying to pull at the Youth Devil Gathering's Press Conference, then finding out that his cousin whom the entire underworld was searching for was in the storeroom of the same building, making out with a guy. And now, this…</p><p><br></p><p>\"Sai, do not let that sword touch you. I didn't think I would ever see it again after he had passed but it looks like one of his descendants inherited it.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"What are you talking about, Regulus? Whose descendant inherited what exactly?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"That light… It was the trademark move of Lucifer. The original one. It is the power which allowed him to stand on top of the entire devil race as their king. It cuts through all kinds of magic. With it Lucifer cut through even miracles and made all kinds of Sacred Gears useless. If it hits you, I will not be able to assist you.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Lucifer!</p><p><br></p><p>The shock he felt at the name was soon replaced by a feral grin.</p><p><br></p><p>\"It just means, I don't have to get hurt, right? I can't wait to see the power of the Strongest House in the Underworld.\"</p><p><br><br></p><p></p><p></p><p><br></p><p>He lay on the ground, several cuts decorating his body with little to no energy left in him.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy, Sam, on the other hand, was only lightly winded.</p><p><br></p><p>The moment he started using magic, the tables turned. It took him a moment to realise that the sword he was using all this time was actually holding him back because he was afraid of breaking it in the fight.</p><p><br></p><p>Once that restriction was removed, all his attacks became stronger.</p><p><br></p><p>Not to mention, the sword cut through his Regulus Rey Leather armour as if it was nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>The worst part of all this was that he still had a feeling that the guy was holding back.</p><p><br></p><p>It did make him realise the difference between them and did a lot to humble him.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, Rias will be safe with him.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, to think that she would find a Lucifer as a peerage member… Her luck was just…</p><p><br></p><p><strong>– Sam –</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I took a chance to sit beside the now fallen guy and use Scan on the orange haired Sacred Gear on our side.</p><p><br></p><p>We were inside a mansion which they used for training. Sairaorg was laying on a bed while Regulus was on our side protecting him.</p><p><br></p><p>I on the other hand offered to heal him from the injuries.</p><p><br></p><p>Devils were beings of magic and being cut by a sword which erases magic itself, acted like poison to him, not that much different from normal light poisoning. It was actually worse.</p><p><br></p><p>So, I was taking this time to remove the poison and heal him.</p><p><br></p><p>How much time will it take? That depends on which Skill Regulus has to offer.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>A Ranked Nemean Lion Bloodline</strong></p><p><strong>A Ranked Projectile Negation</strong></p><p><strong>A Ranked Severing</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Physique</strong></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>There were several other skills but these were the strongest ones. Its powers were capped by its owner so the physique and other base stats were only at C Rank.</p><p><br></p><p>I started a copy on his A Ranked Severing Skill.</p><p><br></p><p>Regulus Nemea is said to possess the power to cut through anything.</p><p><br></p><p>I seriously doubt it but A Ranked Severing was still something.</p><p><br></p><p>I can just imagine this Skill coupled with the Lucifer Trait and the Belphegor's Tear. Add in a good sword and the cutting power behind the Skill would make even a Heavenly Dragon think twice before taking it head on.</p><p><br></p><p>Today's fight was quite satisfactory for me. The experience of fighting with the Vali team on a daily basis showed and I wasn't pushed back.</p><p><br></p><p>The real surprise was 'The Demonic Brilliance of Evil Light' cutting through the armour so easily.</p><p><br></p><p>The effect of restraining a Sacred Gear, is this where Rizevim got his idea of the Sacred Gear Canceller?</p><p><br></p><p>\"So, you are a Lucifer? I thought they didn't intervene in matters of the Underworld\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I have nothing to do with the Lucifers. Consider me a bastard child, if you will. The Lucifer House probably doesn't even know of my existence as far as I know.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"You are a Pure Blooded Devil. So your mother…?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Is not in this world.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I'm sorry.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Don't worry. You didn't know.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"How did you meet Rias?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I was injured and she saved my life. I didn't have anywhere to go and we stuck together since then.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I see. I am glad she has someone by her side now. What happened with her was probably a whim of her father at the start. For him it was a way to establish stronger relations with his friend but things went to hell when Kiba died. Rias running away was a big slap on the faces of both the houses and now even if they wanted to, they can't step back. This whole thing is a mess. They didn't have any reason to hurry.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"It was Riser's doing. He was spying on Rias and realised that she had obtained a Longinus user and pushed the matters forward. Her father agreed. He himself gloated to Rias which was the final straw for her and she ran.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"… so that's what happened. I didn't know that.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Now you know why I want to beat him so badly in front of the whole underworld.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I would have beaten him up anyway but sure. I don't see a problem why you couldn't do the same. So, what are you guys doing?\"</p><p><br></p><p>I explained to him in brief about what exactly we were doing  currently.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I plan to use the merits earned from spying on them to help clear her status and free her. If that doesn't work… well, we will think of something.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"You need strength. The Underworld runs on strength. Once you are strong enough, you can get everything. Moreover, with your blood, half the Underworld will get on their knees to get you back. Clearing her status will be easy enough.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hmm, I hope so.\"</p><p><br></p><p>We talked about several things. I delayed the removal of poison to make it take an hour or so so to copy Regulus’ Skill.</p><p><br></p><p>Sairaorg himself had a Vapula Bloodline and a defective Devil Physique which was the reason for his low Demonic Power. As for his other Skills, he had Physique and Touki at C Rank along with Martial Arts.</p><p><br></p><p>I got the Touki Card from him to push my own Touki to a higher level. A little more and I will be at the B Rank for Touki Skill.</p><p><br></p><p>My attention was diverted by a message. I checked it and found that Vali was asked by Azazel to stop Kokabiel’s attack.</p><p><br></p><p>Things were going as we had thought. With this news, we left the place. With the Peace Conference coming around, things were going to become hectic soon.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: LuluViBritania(FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>This chapter was a bit late because I got sick.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The next one will be another Snippet or The Deal whichever I can complete faster.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Things are picking up pace.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sam’s S Ranked Luck is showing its worth.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The main plot will start from the next chapter where the things deviate from normal….well, more than they already have.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I was asked by someone if this will be a Harem.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The answer is yes.

My demonic power has also increased a great deal. It was a bit lower than High Class but was increasing at a decent rate. We were hoping that I would get to that level of power soon even if I just trained myself for a few days.</p><p><br></p><p>Four days were left from the day I had decided to go and meet a member of the Lucifuge Peerage. Wow, that felt odd.</p><p><br></p><p>Today however, the Vali team were returning.</p><p><br></p><p>I had actually held back at copying the Skills from Rias. I gave her a reason and we both agreed to accept that it was quite viable.</p><p><br></p><p>The reason was… if Rias had C Ranked Luck, which was the Highest Ranked Skill on her entire menu, how much Luck would Issei have?</p><p><br></p><p>Although my Demonic Power is slightly lower than a High Class Devil’s, my overall strength reached that of a High Class Devil recently. I could even fight at a higher level with promotion.</p><p><br></p><p>For the last four days, all I did was go out to copy skills at night, return back home, cook food and train till we dropped. Ate food, rested, again trained till we dropped. Finally clean up and go to sleep. Rinse and repeat. My System showed my comprehensive strength to be D Rank now. It meant, I could copy stuff from C Rankers and hopefully Vali Team won’t be above that. At least not all of them.</p><p><br></p><p>Also, with my promotion to the D Rank, I got a few new upgrades. The range again increased and was now one metre more at 3 metres. I got another Card with a special effect. It was similar to the first one except with a different function. It lets me copy the Skills of more than one person in my range only once.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you remember the plan?” My new roommate asked me and I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>We were going to hide everything about my past from everyone. For everyone else, I was an experimental baby created by the cult members who were trying to sacrifice me to summon something. I was already a devil by birth although I didn’t know my parents. This would make any bloodlines I copy easy to hide or rather explain if I do get found out.</p><p><br></p><p>Apparently, when Rias did find me, I was alone. The cult members were all dead. Kuroka didn’t see me as a human and I could easily be passed as a natural devil.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a good plan and we agreed to it. If someday I <em>awakened</em> some new powers, I would know what else was <em>put</em> into the cauldron to create me.</p><p><br></p><p>At this point, I was a highly talented guy who learned things at a great speed.</p><p><br></p><p>The reason behind this was also the skills I had planned to copy from these people.</p><p><br></p><p>I would first meet them and then make a list of skills each of them have. If there are things beyond our expectations, we will change the plans the very next day, we will decide to copy the skills from them.</p><p><br></p><p>These days, Rias has been working on different forms of Magic. The plan was for her to join the Vali Team and thus the Khaos Brigade. She will hide her identity and will thus need to be able to use different magic to fight. She did know general Devil Magic but didn’t use it often as a medium of attack because the Power of Destruction was just too good at that.</p><p><br></p><p>On that note, I explained to Rias the details of her Gremory Bloodline. It turns out that while they had much larger demonic power reserves compared to the other devils and even some houses, the Gremory weren’t known to have any definite power. Supposedly, their power was Camel Taming, which was what the first Gremory, Runeas, was known for, her love of camels.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias however hated camels. No, to be more precise, she was scared of camels.</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully, the Gremory Trait was different from this.</p><p><br></p><p>The Gremory Luck thing had some truth to it because the real power of the Gremory Bloodline was Luck Manipulation. Although, at lower levels, it was just passive.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t think it would even show up unless she developed her powers to C Rank or above. I could hazard a guess that her luck with Riser ran out because her father was working against her while her brother couldn’t exactly support her. Her father was stronger and her luck was suppressed. It was passive and nothing could be controlled or even known for sure but… none of it stopped her anger flaring up towards her father.</p><p><br></p><p>She was now training to improve her powers to control them consciously.</p><p><br></p><p>It was hard. Extremely so.</p><p><br></p><p>We didn’t have any line of thought to train such an abstract power like Luck.</p><p><br></p><p>Currently, we were only deciding on the outcomes of a coin toss or picking cards from the deck. She was starting with these but I saw a craze in her eyes when she was training these powers. I had to convince her to tone down the training she had planned initially, which involved her walking through a room which was being showered by magic and forcing her luck to save her.</p><p><br></p><p>It sounded like Observation Haki training but instead of awakening her Observation Haki, she was forcing her passive Luck to <em>get a feel</em> of the power and try to control it consciously.</p><p><br></p><p>According to her, real danger would force her Demonic Powers to develop faster, which despite me not wanting to agree was actually true.</p><p><br></p><p>I in the meantime learned the Devil’s skin contact healing from her. It was so we could heal each other after training.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean, we were sleeping together… naked anyway, so, why not make good use of it… well more good use of it.</p><p><br></p><p>She was good for keeping my nightmares away and I did the same for her.</p><p><br></p><p>“I do. I have too many inconsistent memories to make it qualify that I was experimented on and the rest can be attributed to the ritual.” I said as I pulled her closer to me, her hands wrapped around me as well and she lay her head on my chest. “You on the other hand should avoid training that can get you hurt like today. At least until I find a way to heal you properly.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I was just trying to see how it would work. I had no idea what the Gremory power was. I don’t think anyone does. They still think it’s Camel Taming because my ancestor had taken a liking to camels. Those weird creepy….ugh. So, now that I know of this, I want to master it. I want to rub it in the face of someone who was selling me for a Bloodline that he couldn’t even use his own bloodline.”</p><p><br></p><p>Yup. That hate is strong.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I will support you in this but first let me learn a skill that can cure you if things go wrong. I think Kuroka’s Senjutsu would be better suited for something like this.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Take a nap. Whatever happens,we will face it together tomorrow.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p><br></p><p>No other words were said. This was becoming the normal routine for us. The basic knowledge of Senjutsu and Touki helped me to regulate my blood flow to certain areas. So, not all of our cuddles were awkward. The mornings were different though. A half asleep me cannot control anything and she is greeted by Sam Jr. every morning.</p><p><br></p><p>But hey, like Kazuma says, I am an advocate of True Gender Equality.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Kuroka -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She snuck into the room to check upon the runaway princess and her new partner.</p><p><br></p><p>To be honest, the decision to take her in was a bit random. She did realise that she had left Shirone in a very difficult situation and although she meant well for her, if it hadn’t been for Sirzechs Lucifer, her little sister would have been dead. Then, this princess spent a long time getting her sister to open up a bit. She missed her old Shirone but compared to what things could have been, she was still grateful to have a sister at this point. Vali had surprisingly been quite easy about the whole situation. So had Arthur and Le Fay, the former being in the same situation in a way. As for Bikou, the monkey didn’t care. Overall, the entire group had been quite alright with their new addition.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias was someone with potential and with being on the run and encountering difficult battles, this potential would only be revealed.</p><p><br></p><p>It was her new pawn that she was worried about.</p><p><br></p><p>There had been no information about those cult members. They were doing a summoning of some sorts.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy was a sacrifice.</p><p><br></p><p>At this point, different people have different reactions to others. She didn’t mind the good reactions. It was the bad ones that worried her.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias was already broken from her situation. If the guy turned out to be a traitor, it would completely break her.</p><p><br></p><p>Vali had told her to let it be and let her handle it but as someone who brought her into this group, she thought it as her responsibility to look after her, if only slightly.</p><p><br></p><p>Thus, she snuck into the bedroom to see how things were going.</p><p><br></p><p>Though, she was not expecting the scene in front of her.</p><p><br></p><p>Two bodies, wrapped around each other, without a shred of clothing on each. She could see the way they wrapped their arms around each other, protectively that they were quite comfortable in this position which indicated that it was not the first time this had happened. She felt the energy around them, relaxed. It was much different than what she had felt from Rias, the first night she had brought her here. It seemed that the boy did a lot of good for her in such a short time.</p><p><br></p><p>She then proceeded to put a hand on the boy and check him for any sign of spells used in case he was actually taking advantage of the princess and what she found almost made her rethink her results. She again rechecked and the results were the same.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy was completely different than a week ago.</p><p><br></p><p>The Demonic Power was almost at the level of a High Class Devil. His body had become more toned as well. His life force was aligned, signs of a Touki user and his muscles had changed almost to the extent of being unrecognisable.</p><p><br></p><p>What the heck nyaa!?</p><p><br></p><p>Just what the fuck happened in the last week to make this guy into this? She then remembered that the guy took eight pawns, the same as the Red Dragon kid. A guy with the same potential as the Boosted Gear user while not having a Sacred Gear of his own. Is this what that was? A devil guy with the potential of a Longinus?</p><p><br></p><p>This is quite appealing. She could see why the princess wrapped herself around him so quickly. A good choice of mate.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>– Sam –</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I woke up surrounded by softness. The soft feeling on my back, making me warm. I moved slightly and my hand grabbed something soft in front of me again.</p><p><br></p><p>\"<em>Ahhhh</em>.\"</p><p><br></p><p>I knew that sound and to make things even better/worse the sound made the softness behind me shake lightly. I pressed my elbow behind me, pressing into the softness. </p><p><br></p><p>\"<em>Mmanyaa</em>.\"</p><p><br></p><p>. … </p><p><br></p><p>… . </p><p><br></p><p>I gripped the one in front of me because I recognized the voice. My senses spread lightly over the area, searching for an area that can be easily defended.</p><p><br></p><p>Next thing, I tightened my body, my touki flaring slightly as I took Rias in my arms and in the next moment, I was on the other end of the room with a window behind us.</p><p><br></p><p>The bed crumbled by my sudden move.</p><p><br></p><p>It was at this moment that I saw the figure who was hugging me from behind.</p><p><br></p><p>Black hair, golden eyes, buxom figure but the most prominent features would probably be the cat ears and tails behind her as she took a defensive position like a cat.</p><p><br></p><p>The movement awakened Rias who looked around, alerted and saw the person. \"Kuroka!\"</p><p><br></p><p>Ah… I might have jumped the gun.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Sam, it's fine she’s a friend.\" I know that now. I let her stand up again and relaxed. Kuroka relaxed too.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I am sorry. I was surprised when I felt another person behind me.\"</p><p><br></p><p>She rubbed her head sheepishly.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I was tired and you two looked so comfortable so I decided to take a nap to nyaa~. Still did you not like me pressing on your back to react like that? Nyahahahaha.\"</p><p><br></p><p>By this time, Rias also understood what was happening and just held her head, massaging it. She created a magic circle and fixed the damage to the room. I too lent a hand and Kuroka just watched.</p><p><br></p><p>With things fixed, we sat down in the dining room. I warmed something for her to eat, sitting beside Rias too.</p><p><br></p><p>\"It was a good reaction time nyaa. I think I even sensed Senjutsu and Touki just then. Good job on the use.\"</p><p><br></p><p>I took the opportunity to scan her as we were sitting relatively close.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>C Ranked Enhanced Senses</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Enhanced Speed</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Demonic Power Reserves</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Devil Magic</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Space Magic</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Senjutsu</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Yojutsu</strong></p><p><strong>D Ranked Enhanced Physique</strong></p><p><strong>D Ranked Barrier Magic</strong></p><p><strong>D Ranked Poison Resistance</strong></p><p><br></p><p>… </p><p><br></p><p>… </p><p><br></p><p>There were tons of skills in her list.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Thank you.\" I nodded lightly.</p><p><br></p><p>\"He is very shy, isn't he nyaa~. Then again, the position you two were in, maybe not.\" She smirked at Rias.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Rias and grabbed her hand under the table and she smiled at me in return. With the signal received, I started the copy.</p><p><br></p><p>C Ranked Skill took 20 minutes in the range to complete.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a drastic increase from 5 minutes for a D Ranked one. I did get a chance to copy a few of them from a group of magicians.</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully, she was busy eating and talking to us so it was quite fine. I wonder how much time the higher ranked skills will take to be copied</p><p><br></p><p>What I copied was the C Ranked Senjutsu because it was the best one I could get out of her. It had all the things I needed for the moment. Sensing, Defence Ignore, Healing and Hiding Presence among other things. It’s single-handedly one of the best skills out there. I understood it even more when I knew her experiences.</p><p><br></p><p>Meanwhile, Rias explained about my situation to her. She looked a little sympathetic because she was also a part of the experiments and maybe understood what it felt like.</p><p><br></p><p>Dammit, now I feel bad for lying to her.</p><p><br></p><p>It was still early in the morning. 5 am to be precise so we decided to rest for the day. We had barely had four hours of sleep and with the amount of training we were putting in, cutting on sleep is not something we can afford.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka decided to get in with us. It might have been my imagination but I felt Rias get even closer to me, her legs and thighs covering my crotch directly this time. Kuroka sniggered but got back in the previous position only this time, there was no kimono in place and the softness I had felt before was pushed to a whole new level.</p><p><br></p><p>Was she jealous of Kuroka sharing our bed?</p><p><br></p><p>Touki and the newly upgraded Senjutsu only helped so much. So, I caressed her back lightly. She opened her eyes a little and looked at me on which I slowly approached her and my lips touched her forehead. She looked at me, wide eyed but then a light dusting of pink appeared on her cheeks and she hid her face in my chest. It seemed to have relaxed her a little.</p><p><br></p><p>Yup, she was jealous alright.</p><p><br></p><p>With these many emotions running around, how does one even think of a harem?</p><p><br></p><p>________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“So, this is the new member you picked up?” Bikou jumped around me while asking. His monkey side showing up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hello. My name is Samuel but you can call me Sam.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hello hello newbie. You can call me The Great Bikou or Senior or Senpai.”</p><p><br></p><p>“My name is Arthur Pendragon. This is my little sister Le Fay Pendragon.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Vali.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And you already know me. We had a very enjoyable night together. Oh, I liked it when you were rough. I mean breaking the bed.”</p><p><br></p><p>The last one didn’t need any introduction. She had noticed Rias’ emotions and was at this point just teasing the two of us.</p><p><br></p><p>Le Fay grew red at the reveal while Arthur only rolled his eyes. The other two didn’t even react.</p><p><br></p><p>The one whom this was aimed at however did react.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias’ lips twitched slightly but she controlled herself quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>I, in the meantime, scanned the people and took in their skills.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>B Ranked Divine Dividing</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Demonic Power Reserves</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Devil Magic</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Martial Arts</strong></p><p><strong>D Ranked Demonic Power Control</strong></p><p><strong>D Ranked Dragon Bloodline</strong></p><p><strong>E Ranked Lucifer Bloodline</strong></p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>His Lucifer Bloodline was pretty undeveloped. Then again, I guess he was always focusing on his Divine Dividing and never really focused any attention on his Lucifer side.</p><p><br></p><p>His dragon side is much stronger than his Lucifer side.</p><p><br></p><p>I thought for a moment and started the copy of the Lucifer Bloodline.</p><p><br></p><p>Why so? Because I was already a Devil and that was the Top Bloodline among the Devils. Sure, the Dragon Bloodline can be cool but me, getting a dragon side will be noticed by Kuroka and Bikou instantly. And that would raise a lot of questions. Not to mention the extra weakness to Dragon Slayer and Dragon Tamer abilities.</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully, the E Ranked Skill Cards take only 2 minutes to copy.</p><p><br></p><p>It was done very soon.</p><p><br></p><p>The next up was Bikou.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>B Ranked Monkey King Bloodline</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Enhanced Physique</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Touki</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Enhanced Sense</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Enhanced Strength</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Enhanced Endurance</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Enhanced Reflexes</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Magic Resistance</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Staffmanship</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Martial Arts</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Acrobatics</strong></p><p><strong>D Ranked Senjutsu</strong></p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>I started the copy on the <strong>C Ranked Touki</strong>. Although, the B Ranked Monkey King Bloodline is very enticing, I am pretty sure that the scent of a Youkai will be noticed on me very soon. Moreover, I didn’t know if I would grow a tail all of a sudden or not. It was too risky. Physique can be trained by oneself. My Physique is almost at D Rank now. But Skills couldn’t be trained that easily without proper help and instructions and I doubted that I would find many High levelled Touki users lazing around for me to copy from that easily.</p><p><br></p><p>Arthur’s Skill List was much more stable. It looked like the Skill List of someone who was groomed to be a king, which was not exactly far from the truth.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>C Ranked Swordsmanship</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Reinforcement Magic</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Strategy</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Holy Swordsman</strong></p><p><strong>D Ranked Martial Arts</strong></p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>Le Fay on the other hand was probably the one with the most Skills among this group. She was basically the encyclopaedia of magic. Apart from her D Ranked Magic Power Reserves which was still quite good for her age, she was basically a Genius in all types of Human Magic including some really esoteric ones.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, those bastards were doing some kind of genetic experiments on Sam and then tried to use him in a ritual?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you have the ritual’s details? Maybe I could figure out what they were doing?” Le Fay asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“The entire place was destroyed. There were no survivors.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you remember anything, Sam?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I… have too many memories. I don’t know which ones are my own and which ones are implanted and which ones come from…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Come from?”</p><p><br></p><p>This was when Rias took control of the conversation. “I believe that Sam might have some abilities of a Seer.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“What!”</p><p><br></p><p>“I know it’s very hard to believe but from the things he has told me, I am inclined to believe that it’s true. Some of them were things that only I knew of. Some things are completely different but some are exactly the same.”</p><p><br></p><p>At this point, a different voice joined in the conversation.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“Such abilities are not unknown. Although, very rarely are they strong enough. The Biblical God was one of the users of Divination too and so is Indra. The future is not fixed but they can provide some clues to what it can be.”</em></p><p><br></p><p>Two light blue wings appeared on Vali’s back and I unconsciously used Scan on it.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>A Ranked Principle of Supremacy</strong></p><p><strong>A Ranked Divide</strong></p><p><strong>A Ranked Reflect</strong></p><p><strong>A Ranked Poison Magic</strong></p><p><strong>A Ranked Dragon’s Aura</strong></p><p><strong>A Ranked Vanishing Dragon Bloodline</strong></p><p><strong>A Ranked Dragon Magic</strong></p><p><br></p><p>There were several other skills but I couldn’t even touch those.</p><p><br></p><p>I noticed that there were no skills regarding body or magic power.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, anything we should know about the future?” Arthur asked, looking at me.</p><p><br></p><p>Things went quiet for a bit at the question.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s what I wanted to ask Vali about.” Rias asked and the guy in question looked at us in confusion. “Have you heard anything about Excalibur Sword fragments being stolen from the church?”</p><p><br></p><p>“… there has been such news.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Is Kokabiel missing? I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>His eyes narrowed but he answered nonetheless. “I did hear Azazel talking about it. What did you see?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I saw him trying to start another Great War.”</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>“The fuck?!” Bikou shouted.</p><p><br></p><p>Arthur looked stunned and Kuroka also froze over. Vali on the other hand paused for a moment before asking me to continue.</p><p><br></p><p>“He was planning to merge the fragments of the Excalibur into a sword. He has the assistance of Valper Galilei, the exiled church Archbishop who was in charge of the Holy Sword Project. He then planned to kill Rias and Sona Sitri along with their peerages, sparking a  Great War among the three factions.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So I take it that this was one of the odd visions you had because Rias is with us now.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“What else?”</p><p><br></p><p>“You intervened and saved them and took Kokabiel back on Azazel’s orders.”</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka was tensed about Koneko and I looked at her and reassured her that it was fine in my visions but then again, so was Kiba.</p><p><br></p><p>“Vali, I am going to bring back Shirone.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t think it would be a good idea at this moment. I think we should send this information to Rias’ brother who can send a few of his peerage members to protect them and in the meantime if we want to help out, we can find out about Kokabiel and keep guard.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Why would we do that? Isn’t Kokabiel strong? We can fight him without anyone coming after us.” Bikou perked up and I saw Vali nodding his head too.</p><p><br></p><p>I sighed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Kokabiel’s attack would lead the Leaders of the Three Factions to team up and sign a Peace Treaty. The Three Factions will join hands. It will save many lives. As for Kuroka, there is something I need to check if it’s true or not. If it is, there might be a way to prove her innocence. It can at least make her make up with her sister.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What thing?” Kuroka looked at me with narrowed eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“The Naberius were conducting experiments on the Youkai for a long time. You were not the first one. Your mother was in a relationship with the lead scientist.” I saw her freeze up. “He was a selfish guy who never returned her feelings but in the end, she hid all the data about the experiments in Shirone’s hair clip. What I want to know is, was your mother’s name Fujimai and did Shirone have a black cat Hairpin?”</p><p><br></p><p>The girl nodded with difficulty.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then it might be worth checking.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“D-did, he… was he?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Your father… yes. And no, he died before you became a part of that guy’s peerage. They just continued the research.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Excuse me. I need some time alone.” She got up and left and no one tried to stop her.</p><p><br></p><p>“What else do you know?” Vali asked me.</p><p><br></p><p>“I… just saw memories and visions of Rias to be honest. You guys were appearing sometimes but I don’t know things in detail about you. Although, I saw the glimpses of both you and Issei unlocking the real power of Ddraig and Albion.” </p><p><br></p><p>“The Juggernaut Drive?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>I shook my head. “No. The full power. The powers that were sealed away from Albion’s memories even. His poison and Reflect. I don’t know how you unlocked it yet.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you know something about it, Albion?”</p><p><br></p><p><em>“A lot of our powers were locked away when we were both sealed but what he says does feel nostalgic to me.”</em></p><p><br></p><p>We discussed a few things and they planned what to do with the situation. I told them about some things like Loki’s attack and them stealing Fenrir and Diodora Astaroth’s attack but nothing in detail. Despite what it was portrayed, these guys didn’t want to cause widespread destruction. They were teenagers and teenagers messed up. Supernatural teenagers even more so than not.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh… boring. Why can’t we just kick his butt ourselves?” The Monkey Guy pouted.</p><p><br></p><p>In the meantime, Bikou’s Touki was copied. Next up was  <strong>C Ranked Swordsmanship</strong> from Arthur and <strong>C Ranked General Human Magic</strong> from Le Fay.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you strong?” Vali was the one who asked me.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am still learning. I don’t have any real fighting experience though.”</p><p><br></p><p>“He knows Senjutsu and Touki. Some swordsmanship, although he doesn’t have a good sword. All he needs is real fighting experience. We have been working on it for the last few days.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Fighting experience comes only from fighting. How strong would you say you are?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I cannot recall a lot about myself. When I learn something, sometimes I feel like I already know it and those things come very easily. It is like relearning something. I will need to test things out to know how strong I am. Physically and Magically, I am growing. I don’t know if I am growing this fast or just recovering. The ritual did a number on me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then fight. It is the fastest way to become stronger. I will be returning back to Grigori for a week or two. I will verify the news and inform you people. Use that time to become stronger. Kuroka will take you to meet our leader, Ophis.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will not drag you down.” I replied and he nodded before returning back to his thoughts. \"Vali.\"</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at me.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I have the Old Satan bloodline.\" I saw his pause, his eyes widened slightly before his face hardened. \"I don't know if it's due to the experiments or my own. I don't even know which one it is. I just didn't want to hide it.\"</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at me for a while but then shrugged his shoulders. “I have some documents from Azazel with notes about their powers. I will send it to you.”</p><p><br></p><p>The guy was a tsundere.</p><p><br></p><p>By the end of the meeting, Kuroka returned and Vali left.</p><p><br></p><p>The rest stayed and I got up and made food for them. I copied the Skills from them and noticed that my evaluation was still showing a D Rank. Obviously. They had multiple skills at C Rank and even that would only make them a C Rank. I might have gotten the Skills, but my base stats were still below the limit.</p><p><br></p><p>I sparred for a bit with Bikou. That monkey was tough and that was saying it lightly. The guy could shrug off most of my attacks like it was nothing. Only the attacks done by Senjutsu were of any effect. His Magic Resistance could easily hold against my attacks. I had to get in with close quarter combat and swordsmanship but my base strength allowed him to easily keep me on my toes. Basically, he ran circles around me the entire time. I took a decent amount of hits.</p><p><br></p><p>He wasn’t really holding back against me like Rias. The damage would later be healed by Kuroka and Le Fay so he thrashed me around but that also forced me to concentrate more on Senjutsu and Touki working in tandem. Instincts of Swordsmanship to dodge and take steps, deflect attacks and get in some hits of my own. Quickly casting magic for various effects like a simple flash spell to disorient him once, although that almost led to me getting a broken jaw.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha that was a good after dinner exercise. You are a good man, Sam. Make good food and even help me exercise. Welcome to the team.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Your swordsmanship seemed like an amalgamation of several styles. There were hints of Japanese Swordsmanship, the Iaijutsu and even the western swordsmanship I have learned myself. Although, as you had said, your moves seem very stiff. It’s like you know things at the back of your mind and the body is just trying to remember those things again. I agree with what Vali said, you should continue fighting like this. You will figure out your style soon enough. I noticed that you were a lot more comfortable with your sword by the end of the fight than at the beginning. A few weeks and I believe that we could have a good spar too. It’s nice to have you with us, Sam.”</p><p><br></p><p>Arthur said that he will get me a sword later on.</p><p><br></p><p>“Magic was good. I liked that flash thing.” Le Fay said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, that was something inspired from an anime I watched. Solar Flare.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Drag-so-Ball, right.” She chimed and I nodded at her.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Rias who actually looked a little lost and was looking at me worried.</p><p><br></p><p>I even took the opportunity to chat up with Le Fay and asked her about different types of magic. Specifically Gravity Magic. The best way to gain strength quick enough.</p><p><br></p><p>“Gravity Magic is not easy to train in, Sam. Unlike weights, it puts pressure on the entire body and even the blood. The difficulty to do such a thing is far higher than just training with weights.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I know and that’s why I will only start with a very low Gravity. 1.5 times or so and slowly increase it when my body gets used to it. I am not trying to jump the gun but I think that continuously using my Demonic Power to keep myself going in such a situation would help increase my control over Demonic Power as well as my power reserves, not to mention my Physique. It is the best and fastest way to increase my strength apart from daily fighting.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will fight you daily.” Biko perked up.</p><p><br></p><p>Arthur ignored him and got in thought. “A Devil’s physique is certainly more resilient than a Human’s and your thoughts are quite logical too. Just don’t jump the gun.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oi, don’t ignore me.” The monkey shouted back.</p><p><br></p><p>But we did.</p><p><br></p><p>Le Fay then made a Magic Circle in the basement to design my very own Gravity Chamber. I was also given a different magic circle to use for my magic.</p><p><br></p><p>By night time, Rias and I were left alone as the others went to their own places. Kuroka was a bit lost since the reveal. She decided to go out for a walk tonight while the two of us stayed back, deciding to give her some alone time for herself.</p><p><br></p><p>“You were pushing yourself too hard in today’s spar.” She said as we got into the bed.</p><p><br></p><p>“I wanted to get the hang of the abilities I had copied. Despite how it looked, Bikou was actually careful where and how he hit me.” Which he actually was.</p><p><br></p><p>“Still two cracked bones.” She said, pointing at my arm and finger which had cracked during the spar earlier today.</p><p><br></p><p>“Rias, the more I bleed in private, in these spars, the less the chance for me to bleed against enemies.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But I don’t want you to bleed at all. I don’t want you to get hurt.” She shouted but there was a pleading tone in her voice.</p><p><br></p><p>I realised what was going on and took her in my arms. “You remembered the Rating Game.”</p><p><br></p><p>It was not a question and she understood it too as she froze in my arms. I made small circles on her back while pulling her against my chest, I whispered “It’s fine. I am not leaving you alone. I promise.”</p><p><br></p><p>Her body shivered and I felt some wetness on my chest where her eyes were.</p><p><br></p><p>She fell asleep after sobbing into my chest for a while. I kept caressing her back till then. The roles from a few days ago were reversed… But, I didn’t mind it at all. This was the least I could do for her.</p><p><br></p><p>________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I was in the base of Khaos Brigade.</p><p><br></p><p>It was two days later that we were brought to meet Ophis.</p><p><br></p><p>Beside me, Rias was in her disguise.</p><p><br></p><p>The base of the Khaos Brigade was filled with people from various races.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka led us directly to Ophis’ room.</p><p><br></p><p>And there I saw her.</p><p><br></p><p>A black haired young girl with purple gothic dress, vacant looking grey eyes and extremely cute face sitting there.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ophis. These two are our new members, Stella and Sam. They will be joining our team from today.” Kuroka explained.</p><p><br></p><p>Ophis looked at her and then back at us and nodded. She then raised a hand and two snakes made of energy came out of it but Kuroka stopped her. “They don’t want your power. We just came here to inform you about them.” She stopped and the purple snakes went back into her hand as she nodded again.</p><p><br></p><p>I took the opportunity to use Scan on her and was stunned stiff. Despite already knowing that she was strong, seeing the list of S Ranked Skills was just something else.</p><p><br></p><p>I couldn’t clearly read all of those as Kuroka dragged me back with her.</p><p><br></p><p>She took us to the place where the Vali Team stayed in the base. They normally didn’t stay there but still had a place of their own.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I was sent here to keep a watch on everyone nyaa~. You two can take a look around the place if you want. I would suggest the library and the training rooms because they have many things you can use. There are many rogue criminals in the building, so be careful. Also, Sam… Be ruthless. If you try to solve things with logic here, these people will just think of you as weak and try to attack you.\"</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded, reminding myself that this place is the base of a terrorist organization.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I will keep that in mind.\" I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>For the next eight hours, we looked around the entire place.</p><p><br></p><p>Copying things was becoming harder because of the time taken for me to be close to them.</p><p><br></p><p>Although Skill till the D Rank were fairly easy to copy. And that's what I did the entire day.</p><p><br></p><p>In the last eight hours, my demonic power increased by five times from all the cards I collected.</p><p><br></p><p>I was now stronger than Rias just in terms of Demonic power, slightly below what would be considered as a baseline for the C Ranked Demonic Power. I also discovered something. Merging E Ranked Demonic Power Or any kind of Power had no more effects on my card. I needed to copy cards at the same Rank and then too, the results were diminishing.</p><p><br></p><p>The same happened for the Physique, Strength, Endurance, Reflex and basically all other physical skills.</p><p><br></p><p>I dread to think what would happen when these cards reach C Rank or even more.</p><p><br></p><p>I even collected the necessary skills for a devil. Demonic Power Control and such, all D Ranked though. I got a bunch of magic. This time even the devil ones.</p><p><br></p><p>The Fallen Angels and some extremely rare Angels gave me two extremely precious skills.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>D Ranked Light Resistance</strong> and <strong>D Ranked Holy Resistance.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>There were some unexpected things though. I tried to take the Holy Magic but that didn't work. It was incompatible with it. Angelic Bloodline was needed for that and I would have to copy it first. So, I went for something else. Light Magic, just to check if it was necessary for all the skills. This time however, I got the Skill. What was unexpected was that my Lucifer Bloodline jumped to D Rank suddenly due to it.</p><p><br></p><p>I checked the details and the information about the Lucifer Bloodline showed that it can manipulate light, although the light was demonic in nature - The Demonic Brilliance of Evil Light.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn't say a word about it at the moment. There were hardly any Physique masters here.</p><p><br></p><p>To be honest, I was already lucky to encounter as many High Class Devils as I did on my first day. The canon fodders are more or less E Ranked. I more or less spent time getting some magic skills I could from them all day.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t get to visit the labs or things would have been better, because that's where the people of the Old Satan Faction mainly stayed and I was keeping a distance from them for now.</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully, things didn’t go badly for us.</p><p><br></p><p>By the end of the day, I was far stronger than when I had come in. Maybe with the promotion, I could even touch the cusps of C Rank.</p><p><br></p><p>Arthur and the rest had arrived. Apparently, the Old Satan Faction had called for a meeting.</p><p><br></p><p>We decided to attend the meeting. Vali came back for this too.</p><p><br></p><p>Currently, we were in the meeting room where Ophis was sitting in the middle and other people were entering one by one.</p><p><br></p><p>The first ones were a bunch of teenagers with the only one worth any notice for me was the blonde girl. They looked at our team with part mockery and part hostility.</p><p><br></p><p>The one in the lead, a black haired guy came forward with a smile and greeted Vali. “New additions to the team, Vali? Wouldn’t you introduce us?”</p><p><br></p><p>“What’s the use? One is a weakling and the other is a girl.” The biggest one of the group snorted looking at us.</p><p><br></p><p>I noticed the girl in their group glared at him but didn’t say anything.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, you have good eyes. I am in fact weak. I am Sam, the cook of the group. Nice to meet you.” I greeted them all with a jovial smile. I had managed to snag an acting skill too.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka giggled and Bikou seemed to have found something fun so he pranced around too. “Yes yes. Sam is the best cook I know of.”</p><p><br></p><p>In the meantime I had scanned them already.</p><p><br></p><p>These motherfuckers had tons of skills that could be copied. I couldn’t grab any of their Sacred Gears right now as that would be problematic but other things can be taken.</p><p><br></p><p>“Told you, weakling with girly hobbies.” The tryhard human giant said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well I would invite you to cook for us but I am allergic to Devil food. Sorry.” Cao Cao smiled and returned back to take his seat, a bit away from us.</p><p><br></p><p>By the time they sat, I could only be in the range of two people.</p><p><br></p><p>One that stupid giant and second Cao Cao himself.</p><p><br></p><p>I started with the things I needed the most from them. Cao Cao’s <strong>C Ranked Physique</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>The clock ticked and people started coming in.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a girl with crazy looks and Bikou introduced her as Walburga.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, there came a group of Devils. A brown haired woman with glasses, a black haired elf wannabe and a brown haired idiot who looked too haughty for his own good.</p><p><br></p><p>There was one more Devil though. A silver haired one with braided hair. Probably the most dangerous among the group. They had a young looking devil with them, one with dark green coloured haired guy with snake-like eyes. I didn’t need my senjutsu to tell me that he was a slimy bastard. He just had that feeling to him. They sat on the other side of the table too.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias gripped my hand tighter and I knew who he was.</p><p><br></p><p>Diodora Astaroth.</p><p><br></p><p>It was his first time in such a meeting and from what I had found out from the group, he hadn’t received the Snake from Ophis yet.</p><p><br></p><p>A few minutes passed and I had completed the copy of the first skill.</p><p><br></p><p>I felt my muscles tightening and getting stronger at a rapid speed. Ophis however turned and looked in my direction… and tilted her head.</p><p><br></p><p>I stopped myself from swallowing my spit.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at me for a few moments before Shalba’s cough interrupted her and I breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p><br></p><p>The next up was the <strong>C Ranked Magic Resistance</strong> from the stupid giant.</p><p><br></p><p>Shalba started talking about what they had done over the last few months. Basically, what was supposed to be a report seemed like a massively inflated bragging competition. It was annoying as fuck.</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully, I could always use the extra time. He took around half an hour and I had completed the copy of the Magic Resistance by then.</p><p><br></p><p>Unfortunately, none of the other Hero Faction members were in my range of 3 metres.</p><p><br></p><p>The meeting was going to be quite long, so I had to think of something before I wasted time that could have been used to copy Skills. I picked up a bottle of water and drank from it and when I was keeping the bottle back, it slipped and fell to the ground. Some people noticed while I just sheepishly rubbed my head and picked up the bottle a few steps away and sat down on the other side of our group.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sorry.”</p><p><br></p><p>The other groups threw me annoyed looks but continued nonetheless.</p><p><br></p><p>I was however fixed on the ones in my range.</p><p><br></p><p>Siegfried and someone from the Magician’s organisation who came with Walburga.</p><p><br></p><p>I was a little stuck between Seigfried’s skills. He had skills similar to Arthur except being a Demonic Swordsman instead of Holy Swordsman. Although, I cannot imagine it being a relevant skill for me as I possessed the Lucifer Bloodline. I don’t think I wouldn’t have affinity with any Demonic Weapons. He had swordsmanship but Arthur’s skills were more or less at the same level. Although, he had a completely different style of Swordsmanship and knowledge supplement each other and thus I started the copy on his <strong>C Ranked Swordsmanship</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, I copied <strong>C Ranked Curse Magic</strong> from the Magician. The Hexanchant were a group originating from the Wizards of Oz. They had <em>special</em> abilities and magic compared to other normal magicials. My Demonic Power was already rising and taking a small increase didn’t seem like a good choice. With my Lucifer Bloodline, I would gain extra Demonic Power soon enough. It was better to copy the Skills.</p><p><br></p><p>By the time I finished copying the Skills of that old man, Vali who had reported that he found the weapons of the old gods of Europe, Gogmagog had finished his report.</p><p><br></p><p>At the end of it, Diodora Astaroth was called forward to receive the <em>gift</em> from Ophis.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy passed by our group and I had taken the opportunity to Scan and look at his Skills. It would give me an idea about how strong one can get if blessed by Ophis’ snakes.</p><p><br></p><p>D Ranked Demonic Power, lower than Rias. D Ranked Astaroth Bloodline, lower than Rias’ D Ranked Bael Bloodline. D Ranked Demonic Power Control was stronger than Rias’ but that would be due to his Astaroth Bloodline, D Ranked Mind Magic which was stronger than Rias’, probably due to the crap he pulled with the holy maidens. He had already passed from my range by the time I had seen these few skills.</p><p><br></p><p>I saw Ophis’ snakes boosting someone for the first time.</p><p><br></p><p>His demonic power grew stronger and I could <em>feel</em> it on my skin. His demonic power was stronger than the current me after the process was finished. It was still at Kuroka’s level or maybe a tiny bit higher.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a massive increase of over seven times demonic power.</p><p><br></p><p>He returned back to his seat and I saw that all of the previous skills had entered C Rank now. Although, he still showed a D Rank in overall combat ability.</p><p><br></p><p>The rest of the meeting was a bore. I am pretty sure that Ophis wasn’t even paying any attention to any of it.</p><p><br></p><p>We returned back home soon enough.</p><p><br></p><p>Vali as usual went back to Grigori. He didn’t come out for long.</p><p><br></p><p>________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>Rias and I stood in the training field.</p><p><br></p><p>Two days had passed since the meeting and today was the day I was going to contact a member of Rias’ former peerage and pass on the package containing the information to them for Sirzechs’ eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka had got us a pamphlet, which was surprisingly, a Lucifuge House pamphlet.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias guessed that her father must be tracking her through the peerage and thus Grayfia had them use the Lucifuge ones.</p><p><br></p><p>We had carefully discussed what information to pass and what to keep. We basically ran with the same story that she met a person(me) and saved my life, which was true and I happened to possess some abilities. Then, she will go on to explain about some important events and information about Khaos Brigade as well as the Great King faction that would help out her brother fix things.</p><p><br></p><p>I was excited but also worried about something else. Rias looked too worried. She hadn’t slept a single blink last night from all the worry.</p><p><br></p><p>“Will you be alright?” She asked and then a moment later, “ I will go with you too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s fine, Rias. You saw how much stronger I have grown in the last week. You will be recognizable and it will be better if I go there alone. Also, Kuroka will be there as backup. I will teleport out at the first sign of danger. I will not take any risk, I promise you.”</p><p><br></p><p>And I was not saying this just to reassure her with fake words. I did become stronger.</p><p><br></p><p>I am at C Rank.</p><p><br></p><p>I had fought Bikou in these two days and got used to Seigfried’s swordsmanship too. The Enhanced Physique gave me the last bit of push I needed.</p><p><br></p><p>My Demonic Power though didn’t change much but then again it was something that happened a bit slower. There was a change though, just not much.</p><p><br></p><p>I did try my new Lucifer Trait. It was a dark coloured light which more or less vapourized anything in its path. It had anti-magic properties.</p><p><br></p><p>This would explain why it was feared so much.</p><p><br></p><p>Something that cuts through magic itself is one of the strongest things one could use in a magic based society like the Devils.</p><p><br></p><p>At higher levels, maybe I could even cut through miracles.</p><p><br></p><p>It would explain why Rizevim created the Sacred Gear Canceller when he didn’t inherit this power.</p><p><br></p><p>My Skills looked something like this.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>C Ranked Enhanced Physique</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Magic Resistance</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Swordsmanship</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Touki</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Senjutsu</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked General Human Magic</strong></p><p><strong>C Ranked Curse Magic</strong></p><p><strong>D Ranked Demonic Power</strong></p><p><strong>D Ranked Lucifer Bloodline</strong></p><p><strong>D Ranked Light Resistance</strong></p><p><strong>D Ranked Holy Resistance</strong></p><p><strong>D Ranked Light Magic</strong></p><p><strong>D Ranked Enhanced Reflexes</strong></p><p><strong>D Ranked Enhanced Strength</strong></p><p><strong>D Ranked Enhanced Endurance</strong></p><p><strong>D Ranked Enhanced Speed</strong></p><p><strong>D Ranked Lightning Magic(Human)</strong></p><p><strong>D Ranked Fire Magic(Human)</strong></p><p><strong>D Ranked Water Magic(Human)</strong></p><p><strong>D Ranked Ice Magic(Human)</strong></p><p><br></p><p>And a lot more.</p><p><br></p><p>I think it was within my range.</p><p><br></p><p>It took some time to convince her but she agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>It was 10 at night when I summoned a Devil using the pamphlet.</p><p><br></p><p>He arrived at 10:20 on a bicycle.</p><p><br></p><p>Brown haired, simple looking guy rang the doorbell as I opened the door.</p><p><br></p><p>The people of this house had gone out.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka had searched for this and she was currently in my lap in her cat form.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hello, did you summon a devil?” The guy said and I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Come on in.” I called him inside. “I was alone in the house for a while. The members of the house have all gone out on a tour and I was looking at the house for them. Just wanted someone to have company and honestly speaking… I also wanted to see what summoning a devil looks like. I mean I have heard of it but I was never allowed to do so before.”</p><p><br></p><p>I spoke as I led the guy to the living room where I had a movie set up.</p><p><br></p><p>“What’s your name Mr. Devil?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah… I am Issei Hyodou. Nice to meet you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“My name is Samuel but just call me Sam.” I smiled at the goofy guy as I shook hands with him. “By the way, this wish is acceptable, right?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I have done these kinds of wishes before.” He nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>I observed that he was quite serious in the way he was trying to behave with me… and dare I say, a bit professional even.</p><p><br></p><p>It seems that Grayfia had been teaching the guy some things about making deals.</p><p><br></p><p>Good for him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Glad to hear that. So Issei, what’s life as a devil like?” I started the game and brought out some snacks that I had cooked.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s nice.” He said but I could see his eyes getting lost in a daze. “I…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Please don’t mind me. If you don’t want to answer anything, you are free to do so. I am just making small talk.” I replied. I sensed the emotional turmoil of the guy. The amounts of guild and pain were immense.</p><p><br></p><p>“I-it’s okay.”</p><p><br></p><p>I used the time to do a scan on him.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>S Ranked Luck</strong></p><p><strong>A Ranked Blessing of the Boob Goddess</strong></p><p><strong>D Ranked Boosted Gear</strong></p><p><strong>E Ranked Dragon Bloodline</strong></p><p><strong>E Ranked Physique</strong></p><p><strong>E Ranked Strength</strong></p><p><strong>E Ranked Endurance</strong></p><p><strong>E Ranked Martial Arts</strong></p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>The fuck.</p><p><br></p><p>S fucking Ranked Luck.</p><p><br></p><p>Also what the fuck in blazes is that Boob Goddess’ blessing?</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t waste a single minute as I started the copy on the S Ranked Luck.</p><p><br></p><p>9 hours.</p><p><br></p><p>Shit.</p><p><br></p><p>“We are doing an entire run of Drag-so-Ball first season.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm sure.”</p><p><br></p><p>And we did watch it. The show was practically the same as Dragonball Z just with different names.</p><p><br></p><p>A dozen and half or so episodes later, we were talking normally.</p><p><br></p><p>“You seem a bit tense, ya know. It’s like you are sad about something. Wanna talk? Sharing such things helps reduce the pain. I recently got separated from my family and have been missing them a lot.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I…”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am not forcing you. You just seemed too… restrained. It just didn’t feel good seeing you sad like that.”</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka on my lap purred as I caressed her behind her ears.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, she had been quite lost too, since the reveal about her father.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at me and I stared back before hugging her closer. She purred and tried to get out but I didn’t let go and she relaxed a bit reluctantly.</p><p><br></p><p>“You see, Kuro-chan over here had a bad owner previously.” She stilled. Rias had already written the information about her in the letters and Kuroka approved of it if it helped clear her relationship with her sister even a little bit. I continued, “Her mother was in that house and Kuro-chan and her younger sister Shiro-chan stayed there. The guy was a bully. He used to do painful things to her and experiment on her. One day, she stopped giving reactions and that bastard wanted to try the same things to Shiro-chan. Kuro-chan got mad and attacked him. The guy however died accidentally. She was injured too and ran away because she was not even sure if she would survive. She didn’t take her sister with her. I was nearby and picked her up. In the meantime, the residents of the house saw the video of her attacking the owner and dying. Fearing that the younger kitten would be dangerous too, they tried to have her put down.”</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka shivered and I caressed her back again softly.</p><p><br></p><p>“W-what happened then?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thankfully, there was this guy, Mr. Ketchuphead, who was a bigshot around the area, protected her and gave her to his sister. The sister is very kind and took care of Shiro-chan very carefully, loving her like a real family, until she recently moved away due to some big fight. She had to leave Shiro-chan along with her other friends back at home. She however found me when I was dying and saved my life. Since then we have lived together. She misses her a lot and hopes to meet her someday when she can solve things on her own. This one on the other hand, moves around and keeps a watch on her sister. She had been doing it for the last few years already. She’s such a cute thing, isn’t she?” I ruffled Kuroka’s fur as she purred irritatedly at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“She is a very brave cat.” He said and tried to caress her only for her to move away.</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“She is, isn’t she. Now just like her, we all face situations in life, difficult situations and different people react differently to it. Some become angry. Some blame themselves. Some become withdrawn. Some blame everyone else but themselves, just as a defence mechanism. Everyone has their own way of dealing with it. But, the more you keep it in, the more painful it gets. Sometimes, it’s the right thing to let it all out. We may not realise it but… people around us, people who care about us… do. They become worried about us. I mean sure, sometimes we blame ourselves for things but… if we keep doing just that and drown ourselves in it, we will not get anywhere. At one point, we have to get up and move ahead, if not for ourselves, then for our loved ones.”</p><p><br></p><p>The guy had stopped paying attention to the anime in front of it and was hearing whatever I said.</p><p><br></p><p>The words resonated with me too. I had once forced my grandpa to get me a game I wanted on my birthday. He had already arrived but I threw a tantrum and he got to it with a smile. He just patted my head and went out to get my game.</p><p><br></p><p>I never saw my grandpa again. He died in an accident while returning.</p><p><br></p><p>The incident had almost broken me as I was especially close to my grandpa. But no one said anything to me.</p><p><br></p><p>The guilt that someone feels in such a case is beyond words.</p><p><br></p><p>We only realise the true value of something once it is lost.</p><p><br></p><p>Since then, I have paid special attention to my family. My family helped me get out through that with support and I have gotten very close to them.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe, my urge to go back home is just to see if my family is alright. If I could call them all to this world, I would do so in a moment.</p><p><br></p><p>I shook off my own thoughts and saw the boy now tearing up and put an arm around his shoulder to give him a light hug. He broke down into tears.</p><p><br></p><p>An hour or two later, he had cried out and I uncovered the food. We had a quiet dinner or with the morning sun coming up soon, an early breakfast.</p><p><br></p><p>I did maintain a distance of 4 metres from him all the time though. My Range had increased again after becoming a C Rank and a new card and function was unlocked.</p><p><br></p><p>By the end of it, the Skill was done copying. I thanked him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Actually Issei, your payment is on the living room’s table. The one by the mirror. You will not miss it. It’s a crimson box. Can you take it by yourself? I will sign your agreement if you need it first. I need to go to the toilet for a bit.” And so I did.</p><p><br></p><p>I walked towards the toilet attached to the bedroom and Kuroka followed me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sam-san.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s alright. I am happy to help.” I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, Kuro-chan is following you to the toilet!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha she is a bit of a pervert. She sneaks into my bed too….that too without clothes.” I smirked and he laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>“What breed of cat is she? I have never seen one with two tails? Is she magical?”</p><p><br></p><p>“She is a… Nekoshou.” I closed the door behind me and teleported directly out of the place.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Interlude -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Did you find out anything?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I traced back the Cult Members and they were detached from the Wizards of Oz a long time ago. They were researching ways of artificially obtaining the imagination based Magic of Devils and had extensively researched and even cloned different Pillar Houses. The ritual was to sacrifice him and see if they could summon the soul and memories of the original Satans into Sam’s body. Le Fay however found some flaws in the equations and on the site as well. This would explain the mess in Sam’s memories.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So, is he clean?”</p><p><br></p><p>“We found no evidence of him anywhere else. I think he was artificially created using the blood of an original Satan. In fact, the last one we could figure out from the notes was… Lucifer.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So he…was created by them and doesn’t know anything about it?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well the summoning was weird, so we don’t know anything about this.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sigh, well at least he is not a weakling.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh, Vali, are you perhaps worrying about your half brother maybe? Don't worry, I like Sam too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Shut up, Bikou. He is just a good addition to our team.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That… I cannot deny. His skills are growing at an incredible pace and so is his strength. I think his body is developing and reaching a proper level to match the rest of him.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We will introduce him… those two to our main bases then.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you think what he said about the future was true? I mean Diodora Astaroth came as he had predicted.”</p><p><br></p><p>“... It’s better to do as Albion had said. Take them as a possible future instead of something set in stone. Things would be interesting this way. I for one want to see what Albion’s true power looks like. If he can become another rival for me, even better.”</p><p><br></p><p>_____________________________________x___________________________________________________________________________x______________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: LuluViBritania(FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Another chapter is up. I was getting ideas, so I wrote things and this came out.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I know that this System is OP even compared to my other stories but Sam doesn’t have the prep time like others.

What is this place?</p><p><br></p><p>The pain was making my thoughts weird and the blood loss hazy.</p><p><br></p><p>Was I going to die like this? Without even knowing the reason?</p><p><br></p><p>I felt pain, helpless and angry…. but more than anything else, I felt regret.</p><p><br></p><p>My family. </p><p><br></p><p>I couldn't even see them one last time before dying all of a sudden.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly I saw red. No, it was darker than red.</p><p><br></p><p>I however couldn't open my eyes wide enough to see where the light came from.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I don't have anything to offer you. Even the life I can offer you will be one of constant chase and high danger. Do you still want such a life?\"</p><p><br></p><p>I heard a voice near me.</p><p><br></p><p>Life?</p><p><br></p><p>\"Y-ye-ss.\" I forced myself to whisper out somehow.</p><p><br></p><p>And then everything faded to black.</p><p><br></p><p></p><p></p><p><br></p><p>My eyes opened from the weird dream. It was extremely realistic if I do say so myself.</p><p><br></p><p>This thought however came crashing soon when I observed the different ceiling in front of my eyes. This was not my room. I quickly looked to the side.</p><p><br></p><p>This place was not my room. I scrambled down the bed in a hurry and rushed towards the door which was locked so I went to the window to look outside.</p><p><br></p><p>The place was completely unfamiliar. The sign boards that I could spot were mainly written in Japanese and the people walking around were mainly Japanese too.</p><p><br></p><p>Am I in Japan?</p><p><br></p><p>How did I get here?</p><p><br></p><p>That part about me choking on my own blood. Did someone attack me and throw me here? But why would someone throw me all across the globe to this country?</p><p><br></p><p>Moreover, how did I survive?</p><p><br></p><p>I remember having a gaping hole in my stomach.</p><p><br></p><p>What was the red light? I remember the voice of someone talking to me?</p><p><br></p><p>Thousands of thoughts assaulted my head in that moment all at once.</p><p><br></p><p>I felt a panic attack as I crumbled to my knees, heaving due to shortage of breath and started feeling very faint.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t notice the sound of the door opening.</p><p><br></p><p>The next moment, I had two arms wrapped around me.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Sshh you are safe now. No one is going to hurt you here.\" A beautiful voice spoke in my ears as blackness claimed me once more.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Rias Gremory -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She looked at the boy who had fainted in her arms. She picked him up and laid him on the bed and put a blanket on him.</p><p><br></p><p>The Evil Pieces had healed him but he was still weak from the blood loss and transformation.</p><p><br></p><p>His breathing was still heavy, so she caressed his hair and soon felt him calm down.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at his sleeping face and another face appeared in her mind, suddenly making her hands tremble.</p><p><br></p><p>She never thought she would take another peerage member again… Not after what had happened, but fate liked mocking everyone in the face.</p><p><br></p><p>She found another boy in the same position as him, dying and couldn't bring herself to ignore it.</p><p><br></p><p>She vowed to give him a good life that <em>he</em> could have had if not…</p><p><br></p><p>The door to the room opened again.</p><p><br></p><p>\"So, this is the guy you picked up this time nyaa. He doesn't look strong.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I didn't reincarnate him for his strength.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"But he can be a danger to you in such a time. One slip and you would be dragged back to the underworld, demonic power sealed and thrown right back into the hell you ran away from, no pun intended.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I will take responsibility for him.\" She replied.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Whatever you say nyaa. But still… you are too kind for your own good. Some other shitty devil wouldn't have cared what happened to him or even stood there just to watch him die.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I am not… kind.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Some people would call it her kindness, but she knew it. This was not kindness. It was her selfishness. She was seeking to help this boy just to provide herself a closure of sorts, as a means of her redemption for what had happened. Or, it could be her loneliness. Maybe seeking some form of companionship after almost a month on the run alone.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I just hope he doesn't drag us down. Vali is very picky about this. Can he even become strong? How many pieces did he take?He seems pretty average looking at his muscles.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Eight Pawns.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"... huh? Didn't that Red Dragon Emperor take the same number? Does he have a Sacred Gear?\" Kuroka walked up to him and pressed her palm on his chest. Senjutsu maybe. \"He doesn't have a Sacred Gear nyaa. Moreover, I can see him as a pure devil, so he is not even a hybrid. Was he a magician? Doesn't seem like it. The amount of demonic power he has is only at the level of a Low Class Devil. Then again, the transformation hasn't stabilised yet.  Still he might get to the level of a Mid Class Devil at best even when the pieces stabilise.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I didn't know he would take this many pieces.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"But you struck the lottery again. Really, your luck at picking pieces is something else, but are you sure that he won't turn on you after finding out about your situation.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"That's a risk I am willing to take.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Well, whatever you say. Just… don't let your past drag you down. We will be visiting some other countries for some work. I was here to invite you for it but it seems that you are not free for some time. Train yourself and train your new member. Good Luck.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Thank you for all your help, Kuroka.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"You have done a lot for Shirone, when I failed her. I am just repaying you for that.\"</p><p><br></p><p>The door closed and Rias too got up and picked up the bag of groceries and went towards the kitchen to cook. She was getting to explore life much more than she had known previously.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>– ??? –</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I woke up again to the scent of fresh food.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked to the side to see a black-haired girl working in the kitchen.</p><p><br></p><p>I wanted to stand up quickly but my body revolted. The exhaustion was kicking in.</p><p><br></p><p>Apparently the girl realised that I was awake and turned towards me. \"Good Morning. I know you have a lot of questions in your mind but please wait till you get something to eat first. I will not drug or poison you. I could have done so already if I wanted to, so you can eat in peace.\" She smiled towards me.</p><p><br></p><p>The first thought that came to my mind was – She was beautiful.</p><p><br></p><p>More so than any other girl I had seen before. Though it was not her beauty that attracted me to her first. No. It was her voice.</p><p><br></p><p>She was the same girl whose voice I had heard the last two times before.</p><p><br></p><p>The exhaustion was making me very dull and I couldn't bring myself to even shout properly at the moment. I just nodded at her while thinking about the situation. Was this some kind of kidnapping?</p><p><br></p><p>What was that dream about me choking on my blood with a hole in my chest? My chest was fine. Was I drugged somehow? Why would anyone even want to kidnap me?</p><p><br></p><p>My family was not even wealthy. My parents and I worked hard to put me through Med College. How would we even pay a ransom? That said, I don't think kidnapped victims ate like this?</p><p><br></p><p>This doesn't seem like those organ or human trafficking schemes that I had seen on TV.</p><p><br></p><p>She put the plates on the dinner table and went back to the kitchen. I took the opportunity to get down off the bed and take the chair on the other end of the long dining table.</p><p><br></p><p>I was feeling too weak to do anything so I took a bite of the food while she returned and sat on the opposite side of the dining table.</p><p><br></p><p>“I made something light because I didn’t know if heavy food would be good.” She said before taking a bite of her own food.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.” I replied before taking my time to clean the plate. She in the meanwhile watched me eating.</p><p><br></p><p>Once I was done, I looked at her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm, can you please explain what is going on? I just remember myself in my room and then the next thing I remember is a bad dream about me being stabbed and choking on blood. Now I am somehow in Japan out of nowhere. I am a little confused.” I was scared. Maybe the weakness was causing me to be cranky. I was never good at being sick, but still it doesn’t hurt to be nice to someone who just saved my life, or whatever the case might have been.</p><p><br></p><p>“The thing about you being stabbed… actually, let’s start by introducing ourselves. My name is Rias Gremory.”</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, and I am Naruto Uzumaki. Nice to meet you.” I deadpanned.</p><p><br></p><p>“Naruto. You don’t look like you're from Japan. Perhaps one of your parents was Japanese?” She asked quite innocently, still going on with this play of hers.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. It’s Naruto. See, Black hair, black eyes. Who would I be if not Naruto… Sasuke Uchiha? Look Miss, I know I am acting a bit mean, no scratch that, a complete jerk considering that you might have saved my life from what I remember. But please, I am in an unknown place, completely and utterly confused. I am scared. So if you don’t want to tell me your name, it’s fine. I don’t blame you. I am unknown to you, but the least you can do is not lie to me? I don’t think I can take much more stress at this moment. Also, if you are pretending to be an anime character, especially one of my favourite waifus, at least choose someone who looks like you.”</p><p><br></p><p>The girl looked frozen in place for a few moments.</p><p><br></p><p>“What?”</p><p><br></p><p>I let out a sigh and then took a deep breath, “Let’s start this properly again. My name is Samuel White. Please call me Sam if you want to. I am a freshman at Med. College.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I already told you my name though. I know it might not be easy for you to go through all this. The process is stressful, no doubt, I agree. But, the dream you just described was real. You were killed by some cult members who were doing some kind of a summoning and sacrifice ritual when I found you lying in your own blood, dying and reincarnated you.”</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>“And let me guess. I am somehow a devil now, involved in a three way war between three biblical factions, corrupted human experimenting church, megalomaniac descendants of the previous Satans in a world where the leaders of Heaven and Hell are dead.”</p><p><br></p><p>She had her mouth slightly open and while at any normal time I would have totally hit on her because of how cute she looked, it was annoying me to no end right now.</p><p><br></p><p>“H-how do you know of… were you aware of the Supernatural world?” She asked, acting surprised. I will give it to her. The acting is really genuine.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh please stop with it already. Jesus Fucking Christ …….owwwww.” My head felt like I had been smashed with a pebble from behind suddenly.</p><p><br></p><p>I rubbed my head to soothe the pain but suddenly froze.</p><p><br></p><p>A thought came to my mind and a feeling of dread arose in my heart.</p><p><br></p><p>With a quivering voice, I tested out my theory. “God.”</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t know what smashed me harder, the pain from calling out the name or the realisation about the situation I might actually be in.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked up mechanically at the girl in front of me who was looking at me surprised. “D-o you have… wings?”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked a little surprised at my question but nodded and two wings popped behind her back.</p><p><br></p><p>I blanked out completely. This is not happening.</p><p><br></p><p>This can’t be real.</p><p><br></p><p>I was in a different world.</p><p><br></p><p>My breathing picked up suddenly. </p><p><br></p><p>She must have sensed my abnormal state as she quickly got up and came to me, hugging me and caressing my back.</p><p><br></p><p>It helped a bit. I was , however, lost in my own thoughts.</p><p><br></p><p>I was here, so… my family. Mom, Dad, everyone back at home… Did I die? I had taken a glimpse at my face and I looked exactly like I looked earlier or I would have freaked out much earlier. Was I just pulled into this world? The cult. Yes, she said something about the cult. Did they pull me here to this world?</p><p><br></p><p>It took me over a while to get some control over myself and she didn’t leave my side. It might be my imagination but I think I saw her actually worried about me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you. If it’s not too much, can you please take me to an Internet Cafe. I want to see something for myself.” I requested.</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded and within twenty minutes, I was inside an internet cafe near the place where we lived. She asked me nothing except telling me to call her Stella when outside.</p><p><br></p><p>I agreed quite easily. She might be my lifeline in this world. I’d rather not piss her off more than I already might have with some of my words.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next one hour, I scoured the entire internet and every source I could but came up with empty results. The White Family, my family didn’t exist in this world.</p><p><br></p><p>Although, I had already expected the result. The time that showed on the clock on the computer was May, 2008. It was somehow fourteen years in the past.</p><p><br></p><p>It was official now. I was in a different world.</p><p><br></p><p>I broke down into tears.</p><p><br><br></p><p></p><p></p><p><br></p><p>Four days had passed.</p><p><br></p><p>We returned to our home and I didn't speak a word since then. I appreciated that she didn't force me to either because I might have lashed out at her, unfairly.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the course of the days, I tried many things to verify I was in a different world and the most real proof were the two black wings on my back.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, I was somehow in the world that was just a fictional light novel in my world.</p><p><br></p><p>There are differences however.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl in front of me is without a doubt Rias Gremory or rather just Rias.</p><p><br></p><p>She is on the run for some reason and doesn't have a single peerage member with her.</p><p><br></p><p>Or rather, she has… Me.</p><p><br></p><p>She brought another plate of food in front of me and broke the silence for what was like forever for us.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Eat something. You haven't eaten anything since yesterday. The transformation takes around a week to settle down and you need plenty of energy for it. Eight pawns are hard to bind and you don't have a Sacred Gear to assist you, so eat up.\"</p><p><br></p><p>I looked up at her and nodded. The dinner was quiet. I was thinking about what to say.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean what did I even want to do? Getting stuck in this situation is far different than what I had read in stories.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally with our dinner completed, I spoke, deciding to end the silence.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I… We need to talk.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Okay. I will listen.\"</p><p><br></p><p>I took a deep breath and took the biggest decision of my life so far as I said the next few words. \"I am not from this world.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"What?\"</p><p><br></p><p>I sighed. What was I expecting? Of course it won't be so easy.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Please listen to me. I know things will sound unbelievable to you, almost fantastical or utter bullshit but please… Just listen.\"</p><p><br></p><p>She became quiet for a moment and then nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I am not from this world. I don't know how I got here, probably something that cult you said about did to summon me here but I am from a world quite similar and yet different from this.\"</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at me a bit unsure but still asked me. \"Why do you think so? What makes you think that this is not your world?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Several things. I remember clearly that I was in 2022 and it's 2008 here.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Time travel.\" She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>I shook my head. \"My family doesn't exist in this world. I have searched through everything I could and they are not here.\" I clenched my hands as I said this.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I'm sorry.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"No. It's not your fault. If anything, you saved my life and I can never repay you enough for that.\" I stopped her from speaking as I continued. \"There are several things different in this world from my previous world's 2008. Starting from TV shows to Presidents of countries. At worst, it's a parallel world.\" I looked up at her and she was silent, thinking.</p><p><br></p><p>She spoke after a moment,  \"The ritual could have messed with your memories?\"</p><p><br></p><p>I shook my head. \"It won't add extra memories in my head. I have entire fourteen years of memories in clear detail. I don't think this type of thing can be accidental. That said, even that was not my biggest clue that I am in a different world.\"</p><p><br></p><p>I took a deep breath once more and said.</p><p><br></p><p>\"The biggest clue to it all was you and well… My devil wings, getting hurt on saying Go… <em>his</em> name. But the very fact that these things exist was a big red signal.\" Seeing her part offended, part hurt look, I explained. \"It's nothing bad. I don't blame you for turning me into a devil. Ten thousand plus years of life, super strength, wings and above all, magic. I am not an idiot or too religious of a person to blame you for it. The thing is… you or rather this world was a story, a Light Novel in my world.\"</p><p><br></p><p>She blanked out completely.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>– Rias Gremory –</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She was not expecting this.</p><p><br></p><p>Sam, her new pawn, started stating things that completely shattered her perception of the world. She wanted to refute the things he was saying but some of the things were something he just couldn't find out no matter how she thought.</p><p><br></p><p>So, was her life just that? A story?</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>It was different.</p><p><br></p><p>In the world mentioned by Sam, <em>he</em> was not dead.</p><p><br></p><p>Could it have been different if she had given up earlier?</p><p><br></p><p>It's something she would never know.</p><p><br></p><p>The entire story went to insane degrees where the future was involved and yet, she couldn't reject the idea completely.</p><p><br></p><p>His information about the Vali team was also accurate.</p><p><br></p><p>So, in around two months, will Kokabiel attack Kuoh?</p><p><br></p><p>She will have to ask Kuroka and if possible send this message to her brother.</p><p><br></p><p>Still… To think she would one day have an isekai character in her peerage. Normally she would be gushing at it but now, seeing the dead look in his eyes, understanding all the sides of such a scenario, she just couldn't bring herself to be happy.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Why?\" She asked him.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hmm?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Why are you telling me all this? You understand how many people would kill for this information, kill for you or rather what you represent? Then why would you do this? Why put yourself in such danger?\" She asked him curious. She didn't think he trusted her yet. So, why would he do this? Why would he give away his biggest advantage in this unknown and extremely dangerous world?</p><p><br></p><p>\"I have nothing in this world. No home, no family, no place to go, \" He smiled self-deprecatingly, \"not even a reason to live. I don't even exist in this world officially. Everything I had worked for in the twenty years of my life is gone. I am a living ghost for all matters and purposes. I don't know what will happen to me tomorrow and at this point I honestly don't care. You on the other hand saved my life, picked me up, fed me, took care of me and even bore my sass and yet remained so caring towards me. If tomorrow, something happens to me and this information helps you out in some way, then I will consider it as repaying a part of my debt.\"</p><p><br></p><p>She wanted to protest that she didn't want any because she knew in her heart that it was not selfless of her to do it but he raised a hand and stopped her. Somehow, his calm and simple words were more painful than Koneko’s silence had been when she was trying to get her back to her feet again.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let me finish first. Even if I hid things today, I am not a good liar. This would have come out one day later on and then any trust we had between us would have been forever lost. I have already lost almost everything except my life. Trust of the one person who knows me, is the absolute last thing I want to lose.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Why are you talking as if this is the end of the world? You can still do a lot of things in this world? Actually, why even stop at that? If you can be brought here, can’t you be sent back too? This world has a lot of magic. Even if this one doesn’t, the worlds connected to it might have magic that can be used to track your home back. We have a lot of time and you can obviously find a way back to your home and family, but… but nothing like that will happen if you just give up, if you just give up your hope to live.” She shouted at him. The thought of losing another peerage member, made her want to vomit. She didn’t deserve his trust or kindness. She was not a good person. She was doing this for her own selfishness, her own selfish reasons.</p><p><br></p><p>The light returned to his eyes as he heard of the talks of going back home.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you think there is a way back?” He asked and she could sense the hope in his voice. He must be very close to his family.</p><p><br></p><p>“It is magic, right? If you came from somewhere, there must be a way for you to go back too. Although Space-Time and Summoning Magic are extremely rare, it does exist. From what little I know, all the things come here via the Dimensional Gap, so your world might be somewhere out there. We just have to figure out where. We can even try to scan and decipher the magic that the cult people were trying to do and maybe find any source from it. I will ask a few of my… friends about it to see if I can find anything. In the meantime, you should try to learn about the Supernatural world too. It is much more than the few Light Novels that you might have read back in your world. Considering the fact that we are here and you are my pawn, already means that things are different so rather than taking the knowledge you have as gospel, we can take them as fair clues and work our way out from there.” She said as she analysed all the information she had gotten just now. Even a fraction of these could be used as extremely useful negotiation tools in the right hands. She could probably use it to provide a backup for her peerage in case things got serious back there.</p><p><br></p><p>“Can we Scan…” She looked up at him to see him frozen once more, looking at her in awe. No, he was looking all around her to be exact. “Sam?” She called out to him, breaking him out of his daze.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Samuel White -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I looked with an open mouth at the scene in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>Around Rias now floated cards of different colours. Each card had different things written on them. I tried to touch them but my hand passed through them without touching.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Sam?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Huh!\" I broke out of my daze and looked at the owner of the voice.</p><p><br></p><p>“What happened? You just phased out.” She asked, worried.</p><p><br></p><p>“I….wait, you can’t see them?” I asked, again taking a look at the cards.</p><p><br></p><p>“See what?” She asked, looking around quite confused.</p><p><br></p><p>“The cards. The cards floating around you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“What cards?”</p><p><br></p><p>She can’t see them.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly an idea struck me. Is this my cheat?</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly took a look at the cards and read the contents.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>D Ranked Demonic Power</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>E Ranked Demonic Power Control</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>E Ranked Gremory Bloodline</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>D Ranked Bael Bloodline</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>F Ranked Cooking</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>D Ranked Mind Magic</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>E Ranked Barrier Magic</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>E Ranked Disguise</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>C Ranked Luck</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>D Ranked Devil Magic</strong></p><p><br></p><p>And several more skills were lined up but were not of much importance. I mean what would I do with Piano, Etiquette, Dance, Politics etc for now. The language skills could be useful. The Devil’s Language ability applied only to the spoken languages and not the written ones. Especially when different languages in different countries have different accents.</p><p><br></p><p>But somehow no matter how much I tried, I couldn’t grab any of them.</p><p><br></p><p>The keyword was <strong>Scan</strong> if I remember correctly.</p><p><br></p><p>Let’s try some other keywords.</p><p><br></p><p>“Status.”</p><p><br></p><p>Nothing happened.</p><p><br></p><p>So, I raised my hand and repeated. “Scan.”</p><p><br></p><p>And sure enough, a menu opened in front of my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Unfortunately, none of the Skills I had were good enough. The basic language Skills, my knowledge and my basic soccer skills from when I played.</p><p><br></p><p>My overall strength was recorded as F Rank and that too was due to the eight Evil Pieces Pawn Cards I could feel. F Ranked Energy Reserves.</p><p><br></p><p>I couldn’t touch Rias’ cards.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe I needed to try this ability with others.</p><p><br></p><p>“I need to test something and we need to go outside.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Test what?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I… might have awakened some kind of power.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What power?” She asked, curious.</p><p><br></p><p>So, I went on to explain the thing to her.</p><p><br></p><p>“The Skills you have explained are indeed things that I possess. We still can’t be sure what they are. Let’s test it out on others first.”</p><p><br></p><p>It was later decided that we needed to test it on someone whom we wouldn’t miss in case the power was dangerous to use.</p><p><br></p><p>Thus, the two of us got into our disguises. I was using a wig because I didn’t know the Disguise Spell.</p><p><br></p><p>Finding a few yakuza members was easy for her. She just hypnotised them and I used my skill on them.</p><p><br></p><p>Through experimentation, I found out a few things about my powers.</p><p><br></p><p>First, I needed to be in a 1 meter range of the target.</p><p><br></p><p>Second, I could only use the power on one person at a time.</p><p><br></p><p>Most importantly, I could touch their cards. I tried to take their cards and it turned out that I could do so with a thought.</p><p><br></p><p>The process however took some time.</p><p><br></p><p>The Skills they had were all of F Rank.</p><p><br></p><p>The thugs didn’t lose their skills either.</p><p><br></p><p>They didn't even realize that something had happened and neither did Rias who was standing beside me.</p><p><br></p><p>The last thing was that I could only take 1 skill from each person. The rest of their cards became colourless after that.</p><p><br></p><p>Whether there was a cooldown for this, still needed to be checked.</p><p><br></p><p>If I went out of range at the time where the card was being copied, the process is stopped and I have to start from the very beginning again.</p><p><br></p><p>I copied the Unarmed Combat Skill from one of the thugs and I was also given their experiences with it.</p><p><br></p><p>It was, however, a bit disconcerting. The coordination was not perfect. If I had to put it into words, it was like riding a bicycle after a few years. We can still do it, but we need some practice to get familiar with it as we were.</p><p><br></p><p>I got the Japanese Language from the other thug. Once verified that the targets didn’t lose their skills, we tried it in several places throughout the day.</p><p><br></p><p>Starting from common restaurants to dojos, everything we could find.</p><p><br></p><p>Too bad that the people, especially humans, rarely had any useful skills above F Rank.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the old Dojo Master only had <strong>E Ranked Swordsmanship</strong>, which was actually a lot considering he was only a normal human and not a part of the supernatural.</p><p><br></p><p>Higher Ranked Skills took more time.</p><p><br></p><p>Although I still couldn't touch any of Rias' cards.</p><p><br></p><p>\"It could be due to the difference in power. We need to check it more.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I don't think using it on any normal human would help.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I… know of a bar nearby. It is run by Youkai. We can see if your powers work there.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"That won’t put you in any danger, would it?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"This disguise is done with the help of a magic tool that a friend of mine gave me. Even Ultimate Class beings would find it hard to spot me unless I do something obvious like firing the Power of Destruction all over the place.\" She replied and led us towards the establishment.</p><p><br></p><p>The Supernatural district was a strange place. We were only headed to the outskirts but she explained that the further we go in, the more the crowd. The barriers around the place keeps the surroundings free from those without any supernatural awareness.</p><p><br></p><p>Our destination catered to both humans and the supernatural and was on the border of the barrier.</p><p><br></p><p>The restaurant cum bar was a small place which was run by a black haired guy who wouldn't look out of place in any Japanese shop.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hiroshi-san. We will take two bowls of your chicken ramen.\" She ordered and led me to sit in front of the counter.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Ah, Stella-san. So nice to see you again. Your order will be done in just a moment.\"</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at her for an explanation and she just said that she will explain it all later on.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy quickly prepared the ramen and served us. I took the opportunity to scan the ones beside me.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy next to me was a Bull Youkai who had an <strong>E Ranked Physique, E Ranked Enhanced Senses, E Ranked Strength</strong>, etc.</p><p><br></p><p>I tried to copy the <strong>E Ranked Physique</strong> skill first and the time taken was a bit longer than before. Thankfully it was done by the time the guy was done eating his bowl of ramen.</p><p><br></p><p>The card appeared in front of me and I willed to use it.</p><p><br></p><p>I felt a gush of power flowing in me. It was exhilarating. I felt as if I could lift the entire counter in front of me with one hand. In my excitement, I accidentally crushed the chopsticks in my hand.</p><p><br></p><p>It attracted some attention but nothing much.</p><p><br></p><p>I just got another pair.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias looked at me with a questioning gaze and I nodded back at her.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the course of the next few hours, I managed to snag a total of five skills.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>E Ranked Enhanced Senses, E Ranked Enhanced Speed, F Ranked Touki</strong> from one of the guards at the Supernatural District, a lucky find,<strong> E Ranked General Human Magic</strong> from a magician.</p><p><br></p><p>Magic was divided into many parts. The guy had Fire Magic and Lightning Magic both at F Rank. I chose the General Human Magic because it contained the Basic Magic Spells, most importantly, the Teleportation Spell.</p><p><br></p><p>The 1 metre range was the biggest obstacle for me at the moment.</p><p><br></p><p>We roamed around the place and then returned back home soon enough.</p><p><br></p><p>“What do you think?” She asked, getting out of her disguise as I did the same.</p><p><br></p><p>“I can copy the abilities of those weaker or slightly stronger than me, even one level stronger. I still need to figure out what these alphabets mean.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Power Rankings. They seem like the power rankings of the Skills in a Role Playing Video Games. The level of the skill increases. Or it might be the level of the individuals.”</p><p><br></p><p>It’s like the Gamer System in that aspect.</p><p><br></p><p>“How strong would you say the strongest person I copied today was?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Low Class, maybe Mid Class. If I remember correctly, I had the D Rank in Demonic Power. So, D Rank is High Class level. As a reference. F or E could be Low and Middle from this estimate.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sounds about right. And how strong would you say I am about now?”</p><p><br></p><p>“If you can assimilate the skills properly, you would be a decent Mid Class. Especially with the Swordsmanship and Touki. I guess that they are all skills different beings and you still haven’t experienced them yourself yet so you aren’t E Rank yet.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sounds reasonable.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry. We will go back to the Supernatural District tomorrow as well as some other places for you to collect skills and then train to get you used to them. Your transformation should be settled in a few days too. I estimate that your Demonic Power will increase to the Mid Class Levels due to the Evil Pieces completely merging with you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you think I should copy someone’s bloodline or power reserves? I didn’t try those today.”</p><p><br></p><p>She became a bit quiet in thought. “Copy mine. You are already a Devil. I don’t really care if you copy mine but if people find out that you can do such a thing, the entire devil race, no, the entire world will be after your blood, so never… never ever reveal this to anyone. If it works, we will think about the best thing you can do to ensure your survivability. For now, don’t reveal anything about your power to anyone.” I don’t know why but her tone was serious and pleading at the same time.</p><p><br></p><p>I still haven’t gotten to know about the changes in this world. The fact that she was here was already a massive change but I had no idea what had caused it. I guess I will have to talk to her about it.</p><p><br></p><p>It was late at night and time to sleep. We took turns in the bath.</p><p><br></p><p>I was sleeping on a futon on the floor for the last two days but today something changed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sam.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t want to sleep alone today. Please.”</p><p><br></p><p>I somehow didn’t want to sleep alone either. The memories of my home and family were only kept on the back of my mind because I was keeping myself busy for the last few hours.</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay.”</p><p><br></p><p>We said no words and prepared to go to bed. I was not sure if any of us would get even a blink of sleep tonight.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Sirzechs Lucifer -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs entered the halls of the Gremory House.</p><p><br></p><p>Somehow, he had lost the feeling to call it home anymore.</p><p><br></p><p>His father was sitting in his study.</p><p><br></p><p>He knocked on the door.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Enter.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Father.\" I greeted.</p><p><br></p><p>The person in question raised his head slightly but then returned to his paperwork. \"If this is about the reward that was issued for her information or bringing her back, I am not taking it back. She left the house on the day of her marriage, shaming both the houses in front of the entire underworld. She is already lucky I didn't disown her right on the spot.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Yes, it's her luck. I am sure, the fact that if you had done so, you would have lost all rights or say in her life had nothing to do with it.\" He replied bitingly.</p><p><br></p><p>The pen in his father's hand snapped but he didn't care. He was here for something else.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Are you here to point this out, defend her and argue with me again?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"No. Not really. I know that running away was wrong on her part. It doesn't matter if that was the only way she thought she had left.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I was doing things for her own good, the good of the family.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"And how is forcing her against her wishes for the good of the family. You gave her till the end of her university years to fight for her engagement, citing that she would have the freedom of choice if she won the game. You didn't help her solve the problems of her peerage members which could have been solved at a very young age, problems that a teenager like her doesn't even have an idea about. You stopped me from helping her, saying it was to make her independent, to make her responsible. I agreed. Then, she finds and recruits the Red Dragon Emperor, someone who within a year could have destroyed the entirety of her opponent's peerage and suddenly her marriage is pushed to less than a month… coincidentally.\"</p><p><br></p><p>He took a deep breath and continued, \"Then she had to face someone who was a perfect counter to her powers and had a full and experienced peerage, who had his peerage nearly destroyed and was surviving just because of the Phenex Tears. I am sure, him torturing her peerage member and killinq another one was very good to make her responsible as well as good for the reputation of the Gremory Family. Well, she did become responsible, taking responsibility for her Yuuto's death and becoming <em>independent</em>. Guess your plan had some merit after all.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"The marriage with the Phenex was for the future of the Gremory House. Their children would have increased the number of pure blooded devils and the cooperation <em>between</em> the two houses would have given the Gremory House more say in the council.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"And it could have been done when the two had matured a little more. It's not like we are in danger of going extinct. These reasons are the ones you might use to sleep at nights, but we both know it's not true. Riser spied on Rias and asked you to hurry the marriage because he found out that she had recruited the Red Dragon Emperor. As for how I found out about it, he made it a point to rub it in her face right before the marriage ceremony and Milicas happened to overhear him. For someone who is so very concerned about maturity, you are awfully partial on this case.\"</p><p><br></p><p><strong>*BANG</strong>*</p><p><br></p><p>\"Can we continue on why you have come here? Because if you are here to argue, leave.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I am not here to argue. I came here because I heard that you are signing Milicas' engagement contract.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"We have to give an answer to the Phenex for the shame that she caused everyone by running away. Engaging Milicas to their daughter Ravel will soothe things back.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"And Rias?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"When she is found, she will be married into the Phenex House as a concubine. It will be her punishment.\"</p><p><br></p><p>He felt his temper rise but he took a deep breath and calmed himself.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Please cancel the contract for Milicas. I do not want my son to be involved in any political agendas.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"He is the heir of the Gremory House. This is a part of his responsibility.\" His father almost shouted back. \"You are completely disregarding the position of the house in your childish tantrum. You are the Lucifer. You gave up the right to interfere in the Gremory House matters when you took on the position of a Satan. The matters of the Gremory House don't concern you anymore.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Is that so? Hmm… No. You are right. I did give up my connection to the Gremory House. This was the reason you used to stop me from interfering last time. But… if I am not a Gremory, how can my son be a Gremory? A Satan cannot recognize or give their name to their children… But, a child has two parents. Currently, Milicas is a Gremory because <strong><em>I</em></strong> allow it. I can just as easily have him take the Lucifuge name because Grayfia is still the Head of the Lucifuge House. If you want to do politics, then so be it.\"</p><p><br></p><p>He saw his father's mouth open wide in shock.</p><p><br></p><p>\"You would go so far… you would break all relations with us?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Yes. I will. Although I don't think it would mean anything, after all, for you, I can be a member of the Gremory House or not when it is convenient for you. I sat back and now I don't know where or how my little sister is. I will not let the same happen to my son.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"You could find her anytime you want by threatening her peerage and yet you pretend.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"They are Grayfia's peerage now. Rias traded them to her legally. Neither I nor anyone else has any rights to do anything to them. I hope you will pay some thoughts to what I said today. I will be taking my leave, Lord Gremory.\"</p><p><br></p><p>He left the room before the other side could say anything.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Sam -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I woke up to a very <em>unique</em> situation. Well… not exactly unique as it happens to every young guy in the mornings but… I am pretty sure not everyone would have a bombshell like the one currently wrapping her legs around me.</p><p><br></p><p>Last night I found out that Rias really did have the habit of sleeping naked and didn't mind the presence of her peerage members during such a time either.</p><p><br></p><p>Last night, I was too preoccupied with my own situation to actually focus properly on her but now, after a good night of sleep, my mind is much clearer and now I <em>cannot</em> focus on anything but her wrapped around me.</p><p><br></p><p>She was having nightmares last night and I understood why she asked me to accompany her. Someone like her who is always surrounded by people was suddenly all alone.</p><p><br></p><p>The entire situation must be weighing on her all this time.</p><p><br></p><p>Not that I minded it either. I appreciated any kind of companionship myself.</p><p><br></p><p>Apparently she sensed me waking up and opened her eyes too.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Good Morning.\" I greeted softly, trying to calm myself down.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Good Morning.\" She replied, after taking a moment to realise the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Did you sleep well?\" I asked, trying to attract her attention away from my erection.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I did.\" She nodded as she hugged me lightly and that was it. The little me twitched and she paused for a moment, realising the reason why I was still all this time. Her cheeks blushed bright crimson.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Sorry. It's a normal physiological reaction, not something I can control.\" I apologised awkwardly.</p><p><br></p><p>She shifted a little, freeing my lower body and for once I was thankful for the blanket I was using. Although the tent in the blanket made things awkward, it was much better than what it could have been. She looked at me and suddenly smiled or rather smirked. \"Are you sure, this had nothing to do with the fact that you are sharing a bed with 'one of your favourite <em>waifus</em>’?</p><p><br></p><p>I froze.</p><p><br></p><p>Normally, I was quite open about my otaku habits but this… This was a whole new ball game.</p><p><br></p><p>Just how many people would encounter <em>this</em>?</p><p><br></p><p>I scratched my cheek awkwardly, \"I would be lying if I said it wasn't.\"</p><p><br></p><p>And that was it. She started giggling and I chuckled awkwardly.</p><p><br></p><p>At least the depressing atmosphere from yesterday was lightened significantly.</p><p><br></p><p>\"So, if I was/am <em>one</em> of your favourite waifus, tell me about someone else, any other <em>waifu</em> from this world that you like.\"</p><p><br></p><p>… </p><p><br></p><p>… </p><p><br></p><p>I wonder how her face would be if I said Grayfia or maybe Venelana.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Talking about another girl when in bed with one sounds like a sure shot way to get beaten up. A trap I'd rather not test my luck with, thank you very much.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Heh, nice save there.\" She rolled her eyes. \"And here I thought I could get you to blush </p><p>more.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Making me blush, eh.</p><p><br></p><p>\"But hey, at least now I truly know that you have crimson hair.\" I smirked. </p><p><br></p><p>\"Hmm, how?\" She asked, confused.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Carpets and drapes don't match.\" I joked and her blush returned in full force.</p><p><br></p><p>\"So, you were looking then.\" She asked, accusingly.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I would be impotent or gay if I didn't look. I am a healthy heterosexual male however so…\"</p><p><br></p><p>We talked about random stuff, as if trying to forget the situation we were in.</p><p><br></p><p>I don't know how but the two of us decided this without saying a word and I was fine with it.</p><p><br></p><p>I needed this to keep my head focused on finding a way to get back home, if there was one. Thinking about home would just get my attention diverted and make me depressed.</p><p><br></p><p>We got up and got ready for the day soon and I decided to pull my weight a bit by cooking breakfast. The Skills copied from. The Restaurant Chef was especially helpful in this.</p><p><br></p><p>\"We will train when we return back home today. There is a training room in the basement which can take my attacks. You can use it safely to try out your new Skills too.\"</p><p><br></p><p>So that's where she was going sometimes and returning back looking all tired.</p><p><br></p><p>\"So, again in the Supernatural District?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Yes. We will see if you can get some more skills today and then train at night to get you accustomed to using those skills. Our main training will start in a couple of days when you get fully accustomed to your Evil Pieces. We can try promotion then to see how much increase you can get with each of the promotions.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Do you know of any place where I can learn any healing Skills? They would be very useful for our training.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Healing… Is a rare skill in the Supernatural world. Even we devils can only use our demonic power to increase the rate of recovery for other devils. Other than that, there are Sacred Gears and Senjutsu healing but the last one is exclusive to only strong Senjutsu users whom we cannot approach right now. One of my new friends can use it but if you cannot copy my skills, you won't be able to touch hers either. Today, we will try to find some more skills to enhance your basic strength and potential.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I will also check if I can copy the same cards and what happens when I do so.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Okay. By the way, the food was delicious. You are getting a hang of the chef's skills already.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"It's a bit weird. I have all these Skills. I know I can use them but it's still weird using them for the first time. I don't think I can use them together properly.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"You will get used to it in real combat.\"</p><p><br></p><p>With that said, we headed again for the Supernatural district.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________________________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I stood in the training room under the building. It was warded heavily to contain any damage inside.</p><p><br></p><p>We had spent around eight hours in the Supernatural District and especially in the inner areas. I got an<strong> E Ranked Touki</strong> from a tiger youkai, <strong>E Ranked Spearmanship</strong> from a Tengu Guard, <strong>E Ranked Enhanced Reflexes</strong> from a Nekomata, a couple of Elemental Magics from some magicians that I found in the area, two cards of <strong>E Ranked Magic Power Reserves</strong>. I wanted to test what happened if I took magic other than Demonic Power and I got the answer soon enough too. They just merge with my Demonic Power Reserves Card.</p><p><br></p><p>My power finally shot to the E Rank.</p><p><br></p><p>Another thing that I verified was that two cards of the same Rank and Skill can be merged.</p><p><br></p><p>They just fill up the gaps that others might have left and use the experiences of the two users to refine the card.</p><p><br></p><p>A very rough comparison would be two people scoring 50 marks out of 100 in a test. This would not mean they both scored in the same questions. If their correct answers are taken together, the score can increase more than fifty.</p><p><br></p><p>For me, the strength of the cards of the same Rank is signified by the colour of the card. The darker the colour, the more <em>complete</em> the card or closer to advancing to the next Rank.</p><p><br></p><p>Last but not the least though, I finally managed to snag myself a Senjutsu Skill of F Rank.</p><p><br></p><p>Unlike the popular belief, The Senjutsu Skill is not common even among Youkai. This is also the reason why the Nekoshou are so rare. It's because they have an innate affinity to learning both Senjutsu and Yojutsu easily. Thus, it was harder to find this card.</p><p><br></p><p>It also pushed my entire Rank to E despite me not being familiar with the Skills, so I guess that raising the base power enough can also increase my rank.</p><p><br></p><p>I got several changes as soon as it happened.</p><p><br></p><p>First, I got an increase in my range from. 1 to 2 metres.</p><p><br></p><p>Second, I could now touch Rias' cards. So, the guesses that I can copy those at least a level above me was true. Not that I had encountered anyone stronger than her yet… . fortunately.</p><p><br></p><p>Third, I got a Special Card as a reward for Ranking Up.</p><p><br></p><p>It is an Unranked Card which reduces the time of copying any Card to half the required time once.</p><p><br></p><p>Nothing too special at the lower ranks but it might come in handy at the higher ranks.</p><p><br></p><p>Right now my Skill List looked completely different from yesterday's empty list.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>E Ranked Physique</strong></p><p><strong>E Ranked Demonic Power Reserves</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>E Ranked Enhanced Senses</strong></p><p><strong>E Ranked Enhanced Speed</strong></p><p><strong>E Ranked Enhanced Reflexes</strong></p><p><strong>E Ranked Enhanced Strength</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>E Ranked Swordsmanship</strong></p><p><strong>E Ranked Spearmanship</strong></p><p><strong>E Ranked Martial Arts</strong></p><p><strong>E Ranked Touki</strong></p><p><strong>E Ranked General Human Magic</strong></p><p><strong>E Ranked Fire Magic (Human Magic)</strong></p><p><strong>E Ranked Water Magic (Human Magic)</strong></p><p><strong>E Ranked Lightning Magic (Human Magic)</strong></p><p><strong>F Ranked Senjutsu</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I got the Martial Arts Card when I merged two different kinds of Martial Arts Cards together. After yesterday, we searched through several Dojos in search of experienced Martial Artists and lucked upon some masters whom I copied.</p><p><br></p><p>The rest were Auxiliary Skills.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Test out your Magic Spells first. We will check your physique and physical abilities then and finally spar for a bit.\"</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded and tried out water magic first because it was the least dangerous of all my spells. The Magic of the Human system is based on calculations. Each step and the amount of power has to be calculated and arranged properly. It reminded me of the coding that my friend used to do.</p><p><br></p><p>A ball of water formed in front of me and shot at my command towards the wooden target in front of me which got a dent on being hit. The wooden target got back to its previous state easily seconds later though.</p><p><br></p><p>\"The targets are much stronger than they look and are enchanted to fix themselves automatically. You don't have to worry about them. Just let loose.\"</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded in return. \"In that case, I will try more dangerous spells.\" And try I did.</p><p><br></p><p>The spells flew quickly one after another. I didn't have the practice of the magician but my base stats were stronger than the Magician I had copied from which made up for the difference in experience. The speed got faster and faster until I collapsed on my knees. My demonic power ran out.</p><p><br></p><p>\"It was quite good for someone trying magic for their very first time. With a base in Human Magic, you will find the Devil's Magic system even easier. I will get you an untraceable magic circle when Kuroka returns. It will give you a decent boost in your casting abilities. Now rest. We will test your physical abilities after this and then the promotion ability.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Ah yes. There was the promotion left too.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________________________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>\"You did very well for someone who was fighting for the first time.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I still got my butt royally kicked though. I felt like an MMO player who paid for all the gear for their character but couldn't play the game to save their lives.\" I couldn't even put a dent on her barrier magic.</p><p><br></p><p>\"The difference in power was too much. That said, once you master your powers, you would be strong even among Mid Class beings and might even touch the boundaries of the High Class on Promotion. No need to feel so down.\"</p><p><br></p><p>We had returned from my first training session. I was sore all over from exertion, both physically and magically.</p><p><br></p><p>\"So, what's the plan for the future?\" I asked, finally breaking it.</p><p><br></p><p>She paused for a moment and then looked up. \"I want to write the information that you gave me about the future to my brother. It will help us handle the situation much better.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"You will go home?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"NO! I will send a message to him.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Your peerage?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I… I can't meet them. Not now. I… will think of something.\"</p><p><br></p><p>… she opened up to me a little about the reason she left her home. It turns out that Kiba died in the Rating Game. It was going mostly like what I knew, the only change being Kiba escaping the range of the explosion and sneaking up on Riser who was torturing Issei. It freed Issei but an enraged Riser blasted Kiba before anyone could intervene.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy then had the guts to rub the fact that he had spied on Rias and asked her father to drag the date forward so that Issei didn't have a chance to grow.</p><p><br></p><p>Knowing how she treated her peerage, it was already impossible that Rias would marry someone who murdered one of them. She traded her pieces to Grayfia because she honestly thought that they would be hurt if they stayed with her. Then finally as a slap to her father and the Phenex house, she ran away on the day of the wedding.</p><p><br></p><p>She encountered Kuroka later on who surprisingly gave her a place because she had helped Koneko.</p><p><br></p><p>The place we were sitting in was one of the Vali Team's hideouts.</p><p><br></p><p>That explained the underground training room and the place in general.</p><p><br></p><p>\"If you tell me the general location, I can pass the message to one of them.\" I offered.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at me and I shrugged. \"I will not go directly outside your previous school or anything. I will get a flyer and summon one of them, probably Issei because he won't know how to identify a devil if I hide decently. The others are experienced and might figure out that I am a devil too. I mean I could also pass it to Asia if possible. They don't know me and I can leave directly if something happens.\"</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at me and then thought for a while and nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean how to better deal with world destruction level threats than to spoil the future plans of the bad guys to some responsible adults and let them deal with it.</p><p><br></p><p>I have no delusional thoughts about <em>saving the world by myself </em>or anything. Let those responsible for this, take care of it themselves. I will search for a way to go back home in the meantime. Also, if Rias gets credit for solving this scandal, maybe she can get her name cleared and I can tag along to the three faction side to get enough skills required for me.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean Trihexa got most of the people, the strong ones sealed. How would I copy them if they all get sealed. Any one of them could have the thing I need to get back home again.</p><p><br></p><p>\"We will get you to a High Class level first. I want to prepare for everything. But first, copy any of my Skills you want. We need to raise your overall strength as soon as possible.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Once again I checked her Skills and chose… . </p><p><br><br></p><p>__________________x____________________________________x__________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: LuluViBritania(FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author's Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I was too busy the last two weeks so no updates.

I gained three levels in one day.” Shiroe said as we walked back towards the town.</p><p><br></p><p>He was not wrong. It was indeed amazing.</p><p><br></p><p>It was almost evening and I was not expecting to level up twice today with the rising experience requirements for each level.</p><p><br></p><p>This was almost as good as the hunts on which we splurged Veena’s Status Effect pouches.</p><p><br></p><p>“It was mostly because of your planning.” I replied. And I was not lying either. It actually was because of his planning.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy was calculating everything, skill cooldowns and my fighting style to support me exactly as I needed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm….” The guy started to speak before hesitating.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes?”<br><br></p><p>“Can I add you as a friend?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure. Why not?” I sent him a friend’s request and he accepted.</p><p><br></p><p>He was a very good strategist from what I had seen and has a lot of experiences in games, especially mmorpgs.</p><p><br></p><p> I could learn a lot of things from him.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at my friend’s list.</p><p><br></p><p>Only two people on it.</p><p><br></p><p>We stopped when we reached the gates of the town.</p><p><br></p><p>“We generally go out to hunt around the same time everyday. You can join us if you don’t have a set party.” I offered.</p><p><br></p><p>“We? You are with friends?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm….yes. Someone I met in the game. We generally hunt in a team.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you. I will be happy to message you.” He nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>We shook hands and left our own ways.</p><p><br></p><p>He was going towards the inn area so maybe he didn’t have a house yet.</p><p><br></p><p>The sun had just set by the time I reached my house.</p><p><br></p><p>Veena was not home yet so I decided to get cleaned up first.</p><p><br></p><p>The game was realistic in several odd places. Even the feeling and smell of the sticky blood and sweat was on point.</p><p><br></p><p>This is why a bath was welcome. This place was even better as it had a furnace to get hot water in our baths. We just needed to put in some wood 10 minutes before we went in and let the water heat up for a few minutes.</p><p><br></p><p>I put some wood in the furnace and let the water heat up while I removed my equipment and cleaned it all.</p><p><br></p><p>By the time I was done, the water was at a good temperature so I took off my clothes and walked inside with a towel.</p><p><br></p><p>The warm water on my body made me groan in pleasure.</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah, getting the house was so worth it.</p><p><br></p><p>Too bad this place could only help us till T4, which might take four months or so to complete as an estimate. But six months was not good enough for us to want to buy a house here.</p><p><br></p><p>The classes were getting harder to level up so we might need to settle down in the next area if we get both T5 and T6 Classes there.</p><p><br></p><p>The amount of time each Class was taking to level up was insane. I wonder how much time it will take to level up the T5, T6 or even higher tier classes….years, maybe a decade? And that’s if and only if we could even find these classes.</p><p><br></p><p>Then there would be Race and Racial Levels.</p><p><br></p><p>At this rate it might really take us a decade and half to be at a high enough level to complete the game….if we somehow gathered enough players to go that far.</p><p><br></p><p>For now, I can only try to get all the benefits I can from the Traveller title and stay ahead.</p><p><br></p><p>I shook my head of the thoughts and closed my eyes, relaxing in the warm water for a few minutes before drying myself and coming out with a towel around my waist.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my. I didn’t realise you were back home.” I heard a familiar voice and turned to see Veena sitting in the living room.</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t seem shy or anything seeing me in just a towel. In fact she had a small smile as she looked at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I came back a while ago. And was getting cleaned up.” I replied, trying not to show any embarrassment. “Did your assessment go well?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh yes. I passed and I am now officially a T3 Herbalist.” She smiled, showing me the badge.</p><p><br></p><p>“Congratulations!” I congratulated.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you. By the way, today we are eating outside. Let’s celebrate.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure. Gimme a minute to get dressed.” I replied….as casually as I could. This was probably one of the only points I felt my slight mutism coming to my advantage.</p><p><br></p><p>She giggled, probably catching my embarrassment. I didn’t stay there for long and went to my room quickly to get dressed.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>We headed out together.</p><p><br></p><p>“This reminds me, we don’t have any clothes apart from our casual ones and equipment. It’s a bit odd going out for celebratory dinners in our casual clothes.” She chimed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, it is.” I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>My parents were quite rich and I had a habit of dressing well when going out. My mother made sure to teach me.</p><p><br></p><p>It’s just that I haven’t been able to think about those things in this world.</p><p><br></p><p>“We can get something good in the next town. I have heard the capital has many good clothing shops.” I said.</p><p><br></p><p>Good clothes did go a long way when establishing connections with other people.</p><p><br></p><p>As I said, this game was very particular about these small details.</p><p><br></p><p>I wouldn’t doubt if we needed to possess a certain amount of money or dress in a certain manner to even be able to access certain areas of this game.</p><p><br></p><p>She hummed in agreement. “Sounds quite good. I have heard good things about the capital city too.”</p><p><br></p><p>We talked about random topics as we reached the restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>At the door of the place, I saw a familiar figure.</p><p><br></p><p>“Shiroe.” I called out to the guy.</p><p><br></p><p>“Arthas!” He turned back, surprised to see me and nodded before taking a look at Veena.</p><p><br></p><p>I noticed the gaze so I introduced her. “She is my friend, Veena.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Friend? How hurtful? I thought we were partners….seeing as how we are living together.”</p><p><br></p><p>I opened my mouth in surprise, making her giggle. Finally recognising her prank I shook my head with a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hello. My name is Veena. Nice to meet you.” She offered a hand to the flustered boy in front of us who bowed quickly in his nervousness.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hello. My name is Shiroe. Please take care of me.” He stuttered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nice to meet you, Shiroe. Are you a friend of Arthas?”</p><p><br></p><p>“We….we just met today.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Shiroe is a very good player. We were able to hunt a lot more than we usually do due to his strategies.” I added before sending a look at Veena.</p><p><br></p><p>“Really?” She asked, surprised. We did hunt quite efficiently as a team so doing more than that was actually a surprise for us.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, it’s nothing. I just have some experience with MMOs, that's all.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! That’s something I would like to hear about….if you don’t mind that is. We were having a celebration for me getting a new Job Class. Would you like to join us, Shiroe?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No no. I wouldn’t impose.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You are not imposing. You can join us. I remember you saying that you didn’t have any teammates or friends here. Eating alone can suck.”</p><p><br></p><p>With a few more words from both of us, Shiroe was dragged along for dinner.</p><p><br></p><p>“You guys are renting a place here?” Shiroe asked. “Do you know where I can find a place to rent? Living at an inn is taking a toll on my already limited expenses.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I can ask around but I make no promises. I suggest asking any of the locals you are close to.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Locals?” He asked, perplexed.</p><p><br></p><p>“She means NPCs. They have a lot of functions. For all matters and purposes, consider this as a totally new world. You will have to establish a good relationship with several NPCs to unlock any quest they could give out. I haven’t tested it yet but I think it can work for even the unnamed ones.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Really? But that amount of data….” He started speaking before pausing and remembering where we were. “I see. Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>Over dinner, we exchanged several discoveries of the game.</p><p><br></p><p>“So I would need to level up a Scribe Class to get a Scholar Class and then Mage?” Veena asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm….I am not sure if that’s the only way but at least I got it that way.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We were also able to find out only this method of getting the Mage Class. I would have preferred to look for other ways but I think getting started on a Scribe would be much better than to go around searching for things which may or may not exist. Anyways, my Herbalist Class gets experience even from making products so I will not fall behind in levels.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s applicable for the Scribe Class as well. But may I know which path you want to take going forward?” Shiroe asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, I don’t know the names of many classes but I want to use some destruction oriented magic class if possible.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Going for the DPS. Alright. Actually, if you don’t mind, can I suggest something to you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure. Suggestions never hurt.”</p><p><br></p><p>“There is a place where you could get the information. It’s just that….” He spoke before hesitating a bit.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is it?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I found out about this from less than pleasant sources so I doubt this is legal.” He whispered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! Can you elaborate?”</p><p><br></p><p>The guy looked around to see if we were being heard then leaned in slowly. “There is a Black Market in this town. There you can buy all kinds of contrabands and information, even throw in bounties for people, all for a certain price that is. I found out about this from one of the villagers in my starting village.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A Black Market?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. There are all sorts of illegal things there. I have even heard of the existence of a Thief’s Guild. It’s near the entertainment district of the town. You have to go there at night and know the password.”</p><p><br></p><p>He explained everything over the next fifteen minutes.</p><p><br></p><p>“I was only able to get some names of classes to choose before I finally selected the Mage Path. Maybe you guys can find something there.”</p><p><br></p><p>We looked at each other and then back at Shiroe and nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>During the dinner, even Veena invited him to join our team, especially hearing from me how good he was.</p><p><br></p><p>After the dinner, we separated from Shiroe and I looked at her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Want to check out the place?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nothing to lose.” She shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>The Entertainment District of Llyne was like a whole other place, especially at night.</p><p><br></p><p>The entire place was cheerful, with colourful lights and some occasional music giving the entire place a festive mood.</p><p><br></p><p>This was the area which had the more….adult aspects of the game.</p><p><br></p><p>Brothels and Bars were common.</p><p><br></p><p>Women sat behind the glass windows and made signals for us to come in.</p><p><br></p><p>“They didn’t say anything about the R18 Rating.” I commented.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ufufufufu these girls are trying too hard. Just goes to show these are not good places.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?” I looked at the woman puzzled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Truly good places would never place their escorts outside like this.” She replied as if I was supposed to understand everything with just that.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not an expert on these things, lady.</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing my confused look, which according to me was no different than my normal look, she explained. “Which cars do you have at home, Arthas?”</p><p><br></p><p>I was taken aback at her sudden question.</p><p><br></p><p>“A Rolls Royce for my father and a Porsche for my mother.” I replied.</p><p><br></p><p>We were from a pretty rich family.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh yes. Those are quite good. I have a few of those myself.” She agreed. “Have you ever seen any advertisements for Rolls?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>A few of those?</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, who is this woman?</p><p><br></p><p>I shook my head.</p><p><br></p><p>“Exactly. It’s because the people who can afford a Rolls, don’t go around selecting things by advertisements. In the same way, the truly high class places don’t need to put their products out on a show like... this.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah….I see.” I said….because that was the only thing I could think of.</p><p><br></p><p>What else was I supposed to say? I was with a woman, talking about brothels and escorts. This is a bit new for me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Still, this place is modelled after mediaeval Europe so this is quite apt. Back then these kinds of places were for rich merchants and landowners while the higher up nobles and royalty generally kept maids.” She smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>While discussing these things, we reached the place Shiroe told us about.</p><p><br></p><p>We needed two things to enter the place.</p><p><br></p><p>One a particular outfit and second, a specific password, both of those would have needed us buttering some NPC for over a month to get it out of them.</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully for us, Shiroe did that job for us.</p><p><br></p><p>And so, dressed in a black hooded cloaks, we walked on the streets of the Llyne Entertainment district. It was strangely not out of place as several other people were also using the same to hide their identities.</p><p><br></p><p>“I feel like some sort of cult member planning to summon a demon or something.” I joked looking at my attire, trying to change the awkward topic.</p><p><br></p><p>“Even they have upgraded their fashion sense nowadays, dear.” She smiled, returning my joke….although I somehow felt weird with the level of seriousness in her voice.</p><p><br></p><p>“There, that looks like the place.” She pointed towards a door.</p><p><br></p><p>And indeed the place stuck out like a sore thumb.</p><p><br></p><p>A red door with a totally black building.</p><p><br></p><p>Anyone would think there was something wrong with it and they would be totally wrong. </p><p><br></p><p>The Game devs were not idiots.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nine houses left from the house with the red door, excluding the red door itself.” We found a completely unassuming door and knocked eight times. One knock with my hand, four with the iron ring and finally three again with my hand.</p><p><br></p><p>A small slot opened at the side of the door and Veena put two gold coins on the hand which came out of it.</p><p><br></p><p>The slot closed and the door opened.</p><p><br></p><p>On the other side was a man in similar clothes. He moved to the side and we walked inside.</p><p><br></p><p>The door was actually connected to a bar. The bartender saw us and moved aside, opening a door behind him without a word.</p><p><br></p><p>Behind the door were stairs.</p><p><br></p><p>It was when we reached down the stairs that we finally reached the place.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wow.” I couldn’t help but say.</p><p><br></p><p>The entire place was built below the Entertainment District.</p><p><br></p><p>“No way the higher ups of the city don’t know of this place.” I said.</p><p><br></p><p>“They obviously do. It might even be one of the biggest sources of their income.” My partner replied.</p><p><br></p><p>On walking forward, it looked like the place was supposed to be a collection of tunnels and rooms made inside were actually designed to be prisons but were now changed into makeshift shops.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe’s directions were quite precise so we found the place we were looking for.</p><p><br></p><p>Night’s Whisper.</p><p><br></p><p>The shop in front of us was the place where Shiroe said we could find the information about Classes.</p><p><br></p><p>The shop in the Black Market was different from the normal ones in more than one way. Even the shopkeeper, or at least the one I was assuming was sharp and only spoke what was necessary.</p><p><br></p><p>“What are you searching for?” The woman in black veil asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“We are searching for information about T3, T4 and T5 Jobs.” I asked, getting straight to the point.</p><p><br></p><p>“Which class do you want the information on?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“We are looking for anything other than the normal ones found in the guild. Maybe for Hunter, Knight and Herbalist Advancements.”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at us calculatingly for a few moments before stating.</p><p><br></p><p>“Five hundred Gold Coins for the T3 Jobs, two thousand for T4 and twenty thousand for the T5 ones. No haggling.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Twenty thousand!” I asked, stunned.</p><p><br></p><p>Our whole month’s rent with all expenses was around three thousand and she was asking for twenty thousands.</p><p><br></p><p>“Be grateful you are even getting this information. Twenty thousand is cheap considering the classes you named. Had it been the advancements for the Mage Class or some of the rarer ones, it would have been far higher.” She scoffed.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Veena who stepped forward. “We will only take the information T4 advancements for Hunter, Squire and Herbalist and possible ways to get the Mage Class other than the one circulated outside.” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Six Thousand Five Hundreds.” The woman extended her hand.</p><p><br></p><p>I took a breath and handed out the money.</p><p><br></p><p>Six thousand five hundred was almost seventy percent of our savings, enough for us to live off for two months in luxury.</p><p><br></p><p>The woman checked the folders she had and placed a few sheets of papers in front of us.</p><p><br></p><p>“Check and return.”</p><p><br></p><p>The two of us sat down and quickly took a look at the hunter advancements.</p><p><br></p><p>Manhunter. It was as the name suggested. A class which specialised in killing people.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t need anyone to explain why this class was deemed illegal.</p><p><br></p><p>The condition for unlocking this class was killing five humans with headshots in a single fight.</p><p><br></p><p>The information also explained their basic skills for the job as well as the ways to obtain it.</p><p><br></p><p>As for the other Mage classes, she needed to get a new T2 Job either way so we decided to get her the Scribe Job later.</p><p><br></p><p>Squire could get a few other jobs. Apart from the usual Knight Job, there were also the Swordsman and Warrior Job Classes and a few other illegal ones.</p><p><br></p><p>We did get some potential Classes for Veena though.</p><p><br></p><p>“Poison Master sounds good.” She said after taking a look at the papers.</p><p><br></p><p>Hmm. It was.</p><p><br></p><p>To be honest, this was the way she fought till now and she was getting quite good with it.</p><p><br></p><p>We took a look at the requirements and then memorised everything we could.</p><p><br></p><p>Six thousand five hundred gold coins for these….sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>We left the place after checking everything.</p><p><br></p><p>“Look at it as spending the money to buy the time which we would have lost trying to search for all this information. Moreover, this information can later be sold as well.” Veena cheered me.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>We could totally sell the info later.</p><p><br></p><p>With my pain of losing our hard earned money subsided, we toured the place.</p><p><br></p><p>There were several things which couldn’t be found outside. Hell, this place even sold monster eggs and slaves.</p><p><br></p><p>We just walked around, taking a look at everything before returning back.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Venelana -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She put another mix of herbs aside and started preparing the next batch.</p><p><br></p><p>It has been two months since she was stuck in this place.</p><p><br></p><p>There was no information about rescue arriving from anywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>Even by the time difference the Game Master had given them, if that was true, it would be three days in the outside world.</p><p><br></p><p>Her body was discovered without a doubt but it seems they are not having any breakthroughs.</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, for someone to pull something of this scale, they must be equally if not even stronger and more resourceful.</p><p><br></p><p>At this rate this holiday of hers was going to last for a year.</p><p><br></p><p>She wondered how the children were?</p><p><br></p><p>Did Rias even enter the game or were they able to escape this by some chance?</p><p><br></p><p>Oh who was she kidding?</p><p><br></p><p>She knew her daughter and how much she was looking forward to this game.</p><p><br></p><p>There was no way she missed this.</p><p><br></p><p>Were her peerage members inside too?</p><p><br></p><p>And what of Grayfia?</p><p><br></p><p>She had dragged her along into this mess.</p><p><br></p><p>Grayfia was strong but this world didn’t let them bring along their strengths. She could be stubborn at times and an unbending attitude wouldn’t work in this place where they were reduced to the same level as others.</p><p><br></p><p>She just hopes they learn to adapt and all remain safe.</p><p><br></p><p>At this thought, her eyes went outside the window towards the backyard towards her partner.</p><p><br></p><p>The young boy was practising some kind of Martial Arts katas which she didn’t recognise.</p><p><br></p><p>While the game did give an increased damage with weapons if the player were to select specific classes, it didn’t teach them how to wield those weapons efficiently.</p><p><br></p><p>Knowing and not knowing Martial Arts could make a huge difference in how efficiently one could use their skills and Arthas seemed to be quite good at handling all his abilities.</p><p><br></p><p>In the last month, she had learned a lot about the boy, while living with him and all that had only served to make her opinion of him even better.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy was actually opening up more about himself and was slowly but surely showing more emotions. Although her favourite parts are still trying to tease him.</p><p><br></p><p>It had been two weeks since the day she had gained the Herbalist Class and their visit to the Black Market. Several things had changed in these weeks.</p><p><br></p><p>Dozens of players had reached the town in these last two weeks.</p><p><br></p><p>The areas outside the town are starting to get crowded now with the easier prey taking longer to spawn.</p><p><br></p><p>She could see why Arthas was always so in such a hurry to push deeper for stronger enemies to level up.</p><p><br></p><p>She hadn’t realised just far ahead of others she was when she had reached this place but she was starting to understand just how ridiculously insane their ways of hunting truly were.</p><p><br></p><p>Arthas was already at Level 30 for his Squire Class and could get promoted to the Knight Class tomorrow easily after taking a test while others were still struggling to get a T3 Class of their own.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy was talented, so much so that she would have recruited him into her peerage if she could.</p><p><br></p><p>He was a perfect knight, starting from his strength to his manners.</p><p><br></p><p>She was sure he alone could take down at least a dozen or so T2 players in a straight fight.</p><p><br></p><p>Match it with her assistance and Shiroe’s support and their team was practically invincible in this town.</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t like being in a supporting role in a fight but her long life had taught her the importance of every position on a battlefield.</p><p><br></p><p>She was not against being the support for the sake of the best performance of the team and it showed.</p><p><br></p><p>Their levelling speed hadn’t slowed down as much as they were expecting even with the addition of one more member.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe has been a very welcome addition to the team.</p><p><br></p><p>Arthas was not kidding when he said the boy had experience. But even beyond that, the boy was a born strategist.</p><p><br></p><p>People like them were rare.</p><p><br></p><p>Warriors can be trained far more easily than strategists. It was one of the main reasons behind starting the Rating Games, to train more people who could lead in times of wars.</p><p><br></p><p>Someone like him could easily make a name for himself if they participated in the Rating Games.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy himself was very humble and friendly and had become an irreplaceable part of their team.</p><p><br></p><p>Her thoughts were broken by the sound of the door opening and she turned around to see Arthas walking in, all sweaty from his practice.</p><p><br></p><p>“Still working?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Almost done. Just completing the last batch of goods. A few minutes more.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will take a bath first then.” He excused himself before entering his room and returned a minute later only to enter the bath in his towel.</p><p><br></p><p>She smiled at this.</p><p><br></p><p>He had come a long way. A month ago, doing the same thing would have made the poor boy blush.</p><p><br></p><p>Seems like she would have to raise her game if she wanted to get reactions out of him.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Arthas -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“This is the place?” Shiroe said as we looked at the gates of the castle in front of us.</p><p><br></p><p>The Knight Academy looked like a castle.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am afraid we cannot get any further than this. Best of luck for your exams, Arthas.” Veena wished me good luck.</p><p><br></p><p>“Best of luck.” Shiroe joined in too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thanks.” I nodded towards them and walked in.</p><p><br></p><p>I knocked at the smaller gate beside the main one.</p><p><br></p><p>A small window opened. “Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am here for the Knight test.” I said. I already had the maxed out Squire Class equipped.</p><p><br></p><p>This was one of the places which didn’t open until the people met certain requirements.</p><p><br></p><p>The requirements to enter was to either have a maxed out Squire Class or a Knight or any of its advanced classes equipped.</p><p><br></p><p>The gate opened and I was met with two Knights in full plate armour.</p><p><br></p><p>One of them pointed to the place where I needed to get registered first which was an easy process.</p><p><br></p><p>It involved me filling up some forms and showing that I possessed enough efficiency in the Skills of a Squire.</p><p><br></p><p>I have been using this class for almost a month or so. I had no  difficulties in passing this part of the whole test.</p><p><br></p><p>The receptionist Tyra explained the rest of the process to me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Since you are already registered to the academy, you just have to pass a quest to get your certification. This part is just a way to show that you are contributing towards the prosperity of the Kingdom as its Knight.” She spoke as she bought out a bunch of files from the cupboards behind her. “This one looks good.” She whispered to herself as she placed the piece of paper in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>“A Knight has to be capable of both attacking and protecting people. A bunch of goblins have infested the forests near the western part of the town. They have settled inside the caves and are extremely annoying to hunt. Several teams have gone missing there. Your job will be to clear the goblins. If you are able to save people, you can get bonus rewards. Now, this job is a bit hard for someone to complete alone so you can hunt in a team of five or less. Good Luck.”</p><p><br></p><p>I took a look at the paper, reading the contents when the receptionist spoke again.</p><p><br></p><p>“I would hurry if I were you. The last team wouldn’t survive long enough. They have three more days at best.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked back at the receptionist and then back at the piece of paper and quickly left the place.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>___________________________________x__________________________________</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“So we need to complete a time-limited instance dungeon to get you passed with good marks.” Shiroe spoke but it was mostly to himself as he read the quest.</p><p><br></p><p>He had the habit of talking to himself loudly when he was in one of his planning sessions.</p><p><br></p><p>“I guess we would need to prepare a lot of healing and attack items for the attack.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Poisons might not be a good idea. We don’t want to accidentally kill off the hostages.” I added.</p><p><br></p><p>“That's unfortunate. My plan was to flood the whole cave area with poisonous gases. Would have been far easier.” Veena smiled far too serenely at the dangerous idea.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. That would have been too easy. In fact, we could totally do that but that would take away whatever extra rewards Arthas can get for a perfect score. I believe it could be a requirement for some quests or even Advanced Classes.” Shiroe commented, not removing his eyes from the piece of paper.</p><p><br></p><p>“She told me that we can use a team of five.” I offered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Five? I wouldn’t say no but it would only slow us as we wouldn’t have any experience of co-operating with them and we don’t have enough time to practise our teamwork. We would be better off going in just by the three of us.” Veena spoke and even Shiroe nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“We just need to plan for it. Maybe we should check out the place first.” Shiroe suggested.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then I will go out and prepare some non lethal attacking items like sleeping powder and paralytic powder.” Veena suggested. “We don’t know how big the whole dungeon will be so it’s better to be on the safe side.”</p><p><br></p><p>We nodded and Shiroe and I left the house together to go and check out the sight together,</p><p><br></p><p>On the way, I noticed something off.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe, noticing the change in my movements, nodded towards me.</p><p><br></p><p>We had developed a great teamwork in the continuous hunting the last month so one look was enough to know what the other was thinking.</p><p><br></p><p>We left the town gates and quickly walked towards the forest area to one of our pre-prepared hiding places and waited.</p><p><br></p><p>The ones who were following us didn’t come out further.</p><p><br></p><p>“I guess they were just keeping an eye on us and not coming after us right now.” He broke the silence after some time.</p><p><br></p><p>“Any idea what that might be about?” I nodded before asking.</p><p><br></p><p>“There were some people keeping an eye on us since you entered the castle first. I thought it might just be other players trying to find out information that would leave after we went back. I didn’t expect them to secretly follow us.”</p><p><br></p><p>Several thoughts came to my mind. “Their motives could be anything. From information to….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Robbing us. If you can enter the Castle, everyone would know you are the highest level among players in this town which means our team must have more they could get.”</p><p><br></p><p>“If they knew I was at such a high level and even then they dared to come after us it only means they have more people or….”</p><p><br></p><p>“They are going to use items.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Or both.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you see anyone among them?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I was able to see the Classes and levels of two people. One was a Hunter and the other was a Thief. Both T3 level 3.”</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone in our team was far stronger than those people. Shiroe was a level 14 Scholar and Veena was a Level 15 Herbalist and I was a T4 if we considered my stats due to my Shingen-ryu Skill bonus.</p><p><br></p><p>“I guess they were probably scouting us and are planning to ambush us. Since they had a hunter and a thief, they could see our names and levels. They wouldn’t come out so blatantly. Veena-san doesn’t come out of town without us so she is safe. We can inform her when we get back.” Shiroe analysed the situation before letting out a sigh. “Why can’t these idiots just do their own thing and leave us to level up in peace? The Game Master has set enough events for us to deal with. There is no need for any more.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And who told you this is not one of them?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?” He looked back at me questioningly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Other players are the real danger in this game. When all law and order is removed, humans become more dangerous than the worst of beasts.” I said, recalling the day I had met Veena for the first time.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you think they will go that far?” Shiroe asked….hesitantly.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the guy and he matched my gaze for a few moments before looking the other way and sighing again.</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t know how I feel about….killing. Here people actually….” He spoke softly, leaving his words at that.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the guy and remembered that until just two months ago, he was just a simple college student. He had changed a lot to adapt himself but he still hadn’t crossed that line. I looked towards the sky as an uncomfortable moment of silence lasted between us before speaking. “The first day I met Veena, we encountered a similar situation.”</p><p><br></p><p>He turned towards me at the sudden reveal.</p><p><br></p><p>“Trust me when I say, losing our money and equipment would have been the tamest thing which could have happened to us….” I took a deep breath before adding. “Losing our lives would have been the second worst….”</p><p><br></p><p>He took a moment before his eyes widened. “They weren’t….”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Twenty eight seconds.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“We took down those ten attackers in twenty eight seconds.” I actually counted it later.</p><p><br></p><p>He had his mouth open for a while and stared blankly at the sky in front of us.</p><p><br></p><p>I brought out a pouch of water and passed it over to him. He took it without a word and drank a few gulps and washed his face.</p><p><br></p><p>“It was either them or us. When you are in such a situation….you truly realise what and how much you are truly capable of. All of us have monsters within us, Shiroe. Some of us get to confront it, some might not even know of it for their entire life. This world….however, drags that monster out of us and throws it at us to wrestle. What makes us civilised is our ability to keep a reign on that monster.” I took back the pouch and drank a few gulps of water myself.</p><p><br></p><p>I let the guy contemplate. A few minutes later he broke the silence.</p><p><br></p><p>“Was it hard?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The killing part? No. They were Villagers. Highest Level 9 and lowest level 5. Even Veena was Level 9 back then while I was a Level 20 Apprentice Hunter. It didn’t take us more than two good hits with my weapons and stat advantage. What was difficult was what came afterwards….the scene kept repeating in front of my eyes. I could feel those sensations over and over again and had to use calming incense to even get a bit of sleep. I did wake up several times that night but by the end of it, I was in so much hurry that I didn’t have time to think about it. I guess I was keeping myself busy to forget about it. It was Veena who supported me back then.”</p><p><br></p><p>We stayed in that place and let him get used to the situation. The guy is tough from what I had seen of him.</p><p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </p><p>And as expected, he resolved himself before getting up.</p><p><br></p><p>The rest of the journey was easy. We investigated and found the dungeon entrance. Shiroe could only see the entrance when he was in a party with me.</p><p><br></p><p>Since the quest would have started with us entering the dungeon, we left without making much progress.</p><p><br></p><p>On the way, we changed our clothes into hooded ones and even changed our class to throw off anyone keeping an eye on us and only let out a breath once we were inside.</p><p><br></p><p>We entered our house and I closed the door behind us while Shiroe slumped on the chair.</p><p><br></p><p>Veena raised an eyebrow at this. “Looks like you two had an adventure.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We were being spied on and followed.” I said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh. Are they the same ones who were looking at us outside the castle?” She asked Shiroe.</p><p><br></p><p>“Maybe. I didn’t see their faces but Arthas says one was a Hunter and the other was a Thief who was following us.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Both with the ability to see through the levels of other people, hmm. Did they chase you into the forest?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>I shook my head. “No, they stopped inside the town gates.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then it could be anything, dear. They could be trying to find out information about our quest so that they could see it at the Black Market or they could be trying to find more information about you two, perhaps trying to see how we hunt to be at such high levels. We are the highest level players in this town. Some people are bound to be curious.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>We both stopped for a second and looked at her in thought.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>She does have a valid point.</p><p><br></p><p>Especially I, who had almost finished planning to reverse ambush and end them by the time I reached home.</p><p><br></p><p>I suddenly paused at a frightening thought.</p><p><br></p><p>Was I so ready to kill all of a sudden?</p><p><br></p><p>The stimulation from this game was bringing out my emotions. I was not blind to see this. But apparently it was causing something more than just that.</p><p><br></p><p>“....has.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Arthas.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Arthas.”</p><p><br></p><p>I was broken from my thoughts by the voice of Veena. “Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at me and came towards me, placing a hand on my cheek. “I know that incident is still weighing on your mind somewhere but don’t let it guide you into always doubting people. That kind of life is miserable.”</p><p><br></p><p>Was that why I was so ready for a fight? I know I have been trying my best to keep that day out of my mind but was it actually affecting me?</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s not a bad thing to be careful but don’t let that incident drag you down. Maybe we should take some time off after completing this quest or get some other hobby.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Actually, you could pick up a non-combat class.” Shiroe suggested and we looked at him and he explained further. “Pick something which you like. A hobby of some kind.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s a great idea.” Veena chimed in.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright.” Under the pleadings of my team members I agreed. “I will search for a non-combat class after this quest is done.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Great!” She cheered.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>We prepared everything for the quest and left the town at four in the morning in hooded cloaks just to avoid any unnecessary scrutiny.</p><p><br></p><p>A distance away from the place, we equipped our equipment and headed towards the cave.</p><p><br></p><p>On reaching the entrance, I looked towards the two of them. “Ready?”</p><p><br></p><p>They nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>We lit up some torches, covered our faces and eyes and entered the cave.</p><p><br></p><p>The scene around us changed completely.</p><p><br></p><p>We were right to bring the torches as the caves were dark.</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully my vision with the Hunter Class was coming in handy.</p><p><br></p><p>I took the lead while Veena fell behind me and Shiroe took the rear with a torch in one of his hands, lighting up the path in front of us.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe made the first move and sent a Flash Spell towards the end of the cave, briefly lighting the whole path.</p><p><br></p><p>The passageway seemed clear but we heard strange sounds at the end of the turn and sounds of footsteps.</p><p><br></p><p>We carefully went forward but unlike expected, there were no traps. It was just the turn in the cave which made it impossible to see anything behind it.</p><p><br></p><p>As we reached the end, we exchanged looks and with one swift move, I brought a wolf corpse and threw it towards the turn.</p><p><br></p><p>Sure enough, three goblins jumped towards the corpse from the corner at the corpse as two arrows hit it.</p><p><br></p><p>We finally saw the figure of the creatures.</p><p><br></p><p>They were the size of a ten year old human kid with the face of a deformed old man and completely green in colour. They wore a rag around their waist and one of them didn’t even do that.</p><p><br></p><p>A surprising thing about them was the agility with which they attacked. They were surprisingly fast.</p><p><br></p><p>I jumped in with my shield and bashed two of them away while slashing the last one with a Swift Strike.</p><p><br></p><p>Veena followed behind me with a spear, covering my back while Shiroe threw another Flash Spell in the corner.</p><p><br></p><p>Shrill screams rang out in the place and I turned to look at four goblins holding their eyes. Three of them had bows and arrows while the last one had a dagger coated with something in its hand.</p><p><br></p><p>“Four.” I shouted before I shot forward immediately and used my Heavy Blow Skill cut through the archers.</p><p><br></p><p>Veena right behind me struck the one with a dagger right through its eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>The last archer had not recovered from the effects of the flash so we took it down with simple attacks.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe had to conserve his mana as we didn’t know how long this dungeon would take.</p><p><br></p><p>The seven goblins were taken down within moments.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe checked the weapons.</p><p><br></p><p>“Poisoned.” He confirmed. “Be careful to not let them hit.”</p><p><br></p><p>We nodded as I stored the Goblin Corpses and the Wolf Corpse back into my inventory and headed forward.</p><p><br></p><p>The entire place was a network of caves and these pesky little buggers were always ready in an ambush</p><p><br></p><p>This made our progress very slow.</p><p><br></p><p>There was also the fact that our general tactics of hunting, poison and kill every fucking thing was out since we were afraid of hostages dying.</p><p><br></p><p>The further we went inside, the darker the cave became with only occasional torches here and there.</p><p><br></p><p>The place branched off in many ways with rocks here and there, making many blind spots for us to see which made everything even harder.</p><p><br></p><p>More often than not, we had to check our backs to make sure we killed everyone.</p><p><br></p><p>Thrice we had encountered sneak attacks from the shadows and I had to fall back to support Shiroe.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, we reached a place where the cave branched into three paths.</p><p><br></p><p>“Which one?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s test.” Shiroe and Veena came forward.</p><p><br></p><p>He cast a Flash Spell while she threw Pepper Bombs inside the three pathways.</p><p><br></p><p>Shrieks ran from all of them but surprisingly it was the rightmost one in which some coughing sound came from.</p><p><br></p><p>We looked at each other and raced forward towards the last pathway while Shiroe boosted us.</p><p><br></p><p>My steps faltered when we reached the end.</p><p><br></p><p>Eight Goblins were clutching their eyes or coughing violently.</p><p><br></p><p>They had sharper noses than humans and Veena’s Pepper Bombs used this against them.</p><p><br></p><p>But what I was looking at wasn’t that.</p><p><br></p><p>Six human bodies were in the room. Two boys were already dead and they had their stomachs gutted and partially eaten while the four girls were either unconscious or almost on the verge of unconsciousness. They were completely naked and I didn’t need to be an expert to know what was done to them. There were bruises all over their bodies with dried blood and semen or at least that’s what I assumed it was on their privates.</p><p><br></p><p>Three of the women’s eyes looked almost dead while the last one was unconscious.</p><p><br></p><p>And as if to laugh at their situation, three newborn goblins were suckling on their breasts, their entire breast was full of bite marks, deep ones, leaving them infected.</p><p><br></p><p>Veena was right.</p><p><br></p><p>Something about this game had changed me, maybe even made me more aggressive but right now I didn’t think my anger had anything to do with that.</p><p><br></p><p>I let out my Shout Skill.</p><p><br></p><p>It raised my attack and speed for 12 seconds and used Rush almost simultaneously, thrusting my sword right through the head of one of the goblins. Pulling back, I used Swift Strike on the one beside it.</p><p><br></p><p>One of them jumped on me but was bashed away with a Spear as Veena covered my back.</p><p><br></p><p>“Shiroe!” I shouted, finally getting the attention of our last teammate, breaking him out of his shock and he cast Bind on one of the enemies and Stun on another and I used Shield Bash on the last one before hacking it’s head with my next strike.</p><p><br></p><p>Veena fought the one she had swatted away and Shiroe lent support while I went down to take out the stunned ones.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole battle didn’t last much longer, less than thirty seconds but as soon as it ended, Shiroe threw up on the side.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t throw up but stepped forward towards the newborns.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you going to kill them?” I heard Shiroe speak slightly hesitantly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.” I spoke seriously and asked without looking back. “Do you think I shouldn’t?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It just feels a bit strange. I know this is a game and a quest but….they look like children. I know I shouldn’t feel like this but it feels so….dammit, couldn’t there be any good goblins?”</p><p><br></p><p>I know his emotional turmoil.</p><p><br></p><p>It proved that my new friend was human.</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s why I wanted to get it done myself.</p><p><br></p><p>He will get used to it one day but if there is a chance to reduce these complicated feelings, I will take it.</p><p><br></p><p>I suddenly remembered a line from another anime in my past life.</p><p><br></p><p>For once I didn’t care if this was a reference or not.</p><p><br></p><p>“A good goblin? I guess there might be one if you looked really hard. But in the end, the only good goblins are the ones who never come out of their holes.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sure enough another notification appeared in front of me but right now I was too angry to pay attention to it.</p><p><br></p><p>That fucking Game Master really had to put these types of goblins in the game….</p><p><br></p><p>In my anger, I stomped on the heads of the abominations, crushing them one by one.</p><p><br></p><p>Veena, in the meanwhile, covered the girls with clothes she had brought out from her inventory.</p><p><br></p><p>Unfortunately, we didn’t get much time to sort out our feelings as we heard several footsteps rushing forward from the tunnel towards us.</p><p><br></p><p>Veena quickly threw several of her special pouches towards the entrance.</p><p><br></p><p>“We need cover.” Shiroe shouted and I, quick on my feet, I brought out animal corpses and stacked them in front of us.</p><p><br></p><p>These would protect the hostages behind us, give us some means of protection from their arrows and narrow the passage so that they cannot easily reach us.</p><p><br></p><p>One by one, twenty three of those abominable creatures rushed in.</p><p><br></p><p>The strangest ones were the two larger ones, the size of an human adult donned in leather armour, carrying spiked wooden maces. Hobgoblins. Behind them was a hunched back one with some kind of totem or staff in its hand. A Goblin Shaman.</p><p><br></p><p>All were T3 Monsters.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe shot another one of his Flash Spells which had recovered from the cooldown period and I covered the gap through which they could enter.</p><p><br></p><p>The Flash Spell hadn’t done too much as there were too many goblins and some got covered behind the taller ones.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will take down the Shaman first.” Shiroe commanded and Veena thrust her spear, right from my side, to throw back one of the goblins who had escaped the Flash Spell and tried to climb the corpse of a bear to attack us while she threw a few more of her bombs in the crowd.</p><p><br></p><p>I slashed the one in front of me with a Swift Strike and kicked another one of them away.</p><p><br></p><p>The bigger ones had recovered and came forward to attack.</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully, due to the size of the passage, only one could come forward.</p><p><br></p><p>It raised the spiked mace above its head and a slight light gathered on the mace.</p><p><br></p><p>“A Skill!” Shiroe shouted and I didn’t need another reminder. The mace came down.</p><p><br></p><p>I too raised my Shield and used a Skill of my own.</p><p><br></p><p>Counter.</p><p><br></p><p>The Mace clashed with my shield and was rebounded back as the Hobgoblin lost its balance and I used a Heavy Strike directly on its chest.</p><p><br></p><p>It fell back on top of two goblins and crushed them under it.</p><p><br></p><p>This was the first enemy which hadn’t died directly from my Heavy Strike attack in a long time.</p><p><br></p><p>That was my strongest attack and with my stats and buffs right now, I was comparable to a T4 monster. Just goes to show this quest was not easy.</p><p><br></p><p>Veena thrust her spear on its legs and attacked it while I covered another attack from the other Hobgoblin behind it.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe was still sniping the Shaman who was having a hard time casting spells due to the effects of Veena’s pouches and Shiroe’s attacks.</p><p><br></p><p>My Skills recharged and I let out a volley of Skills on the Hobgoblin, finally taking it out with a Swift Strike, decapitating it.</p><p><br></p><p>The fight lasted for several minutes and we whitted down their numbers one by one.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe took an arrow to his shoulder while I felt my armour heat up and burn my arm due to a fireball from the damned Shaman but continued fighting and finally, we struck down the last monster.</p><p><br></p><p>Messages of completing the dungeon appeared in front of us and only then did we take a breath of relief.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Veena. “Can you please check the condition of the survivors and see if you can do anything?”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded and went forward, feeding antidotes to the survivors and applying some salve on their wounds.</p><p><br></p><p>I checked the notifications in the meantime.</p><p><br></p><p>This quest was….very annoying.</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am back with another chapter of SAO.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>This chapter was mostly focused on world building and some communication between the members of the team.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I wanted to take some time to develop their relationship and show how they develop as people as they go forward.

Although before sleeping, she scattered some kind of powder which I later found out was a Repelling Powder.</p><p><br></p><p>It did exactly as the name suggested.</p><p><br></p><p>A low grade repelling powder kept animals of Tier 1 away.</p><p><br></p><p>I woke up and stretched before leaving the tent only to see Veena cooking something on a bonfire.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good Morning, Arthas.” She smiled at me as I came out of the tent. “It was already morning so I decided to prepare some breakfast for us.”</p><p><br></p><p>She removed the pot from the bonfire and opened it to reveal boiled eggs.</p><p><br></p><p>There were already two plates ready with sandwiches and she added the eggs after peeling the shells off to the plates. “There, all ready.”</p><p><br></p><p>“....thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh don’t mind it. I did say that I will take care of the expenses of the trip, didn’t I?”</p><p><br></p><p>“You have already done more than I could ask for during the hunt. This is….”</p><p><br></p><p>“And I gained experience from the hunt too. It was something we both agreed to. Now wash up and get ready. You don’t want the food to get cold.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded and went to the pond to wash.</p><p><br></p><p>We had a simple breakfast and while she cleaned everything up, I packed the Tent and gave it to her.</p><p><br></p><p>We talked about some random topics.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, we set off for the Town of Llyne to complete our journey.</p><p><br></p><p>The rest of the journey was quite uneventful as we didn’t stop anywhere to rest or hunt.</p><p><br></p><p>While we would have loved to do so, first, we were in a different area now, and the level of animals near the area was higher. Secondly, Veena didn’t have any of her special pouches anymore so we didn’t dare take any risk.</p><p><br></p><p>It was late in the afternoon that I saw huge walls in the distance.</p><p><br></p><p>The Town of Llyne was up ahead.</p><p><br></p><p>After arriving, we saw a big wooden gate with two guards.</p><p><br></p><p>Veena took the lead and spoke to the two guards.</p><p><br></p><p>We had to pay some money at the gate and were easily allowed entry.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Welcome to Llyne</strong></p><p><br></p><p>A message flashed in front of my eyes and I stopped for a second.</p><p><br></p><p>Veena’s steps halted so she must have seen the message too.</p><p><br></p><p>We looked at the town which looked like a town right out of mediaeval Europe. Stone buildings with red tiled roofs, people going around the place using carriages and horses.</p><p><br></p><p>The roads were paved with a stone which looked quite similar to granite </p><p><br></p><p>“What’s the plan now?” She asked me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s find a place to stay first. Then we can go around and search for information and share whatever we find. And finally, we can sell the things we’ve hunted.” I proposed.</p><p><br></p><p>She was good at communicating with people and thus could get information from places which I couldn’t. I wasn’t so arrogant that I wouldn’t accept that she was better at such things than myself.</p><p><br></p><p>“That sounds like a good plan.”</p><p><br></p><p>We asked around and found an inn.</p><p><br></p><p>The cost of renting a room in this town was ten times more than back in the village.</p><p><br></p><p>It was understandable but surprising.</p><p><br></p><p>We booked two rooms and left outside to collect information.</p><p><br></p><p>I asked for the Hunter’s Association or as they called it here Hunter’s Lodge to try and see if there was a quest for T4 Class for a Hunter.</p><p><br></p><p>From what I learned, the town had a separate commercial area where most of the associations in the town were.</p><p><br></p><p>With some directions from the people, I was able to walk there in twenty minutes.</p><p><br></p><p>I saw the Archer’s Guild, Adventurer’s Guild, Blacksmith’s Guild, etc, each grander than the other.</p><p><br></p><p>The Merchant’s Association was on the other side of the town near the market.</p><p><br></p><p>The Hunter’s Lodge was a similar building, completely made of stone.</p><p><br></p><p>It had the emblem of the Hunter’s Lodge on top of the huge gate.</p><p><br></p><p>On entering the building, I directly went to the counter.</p><p><br></p><p>The receptionist was named Sasha.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hello, what can I do for you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“My name is Arthas. I am from the Redwick Village.” I placed my Hunter’s Badge on the desk. “I recently became a Hunter and wanted to register here.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! A new hunter from Redwick. How is that old man Gunter doing?” She asked, as she took the badge and started the procedure.</p><p><br></p><p>“He is fine. Mostly enjoying his semi-retired life.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha he has always been like that.” She handed me my badge back and laughed. “At the Llyne Hunter’s Lodge, we have eight advisors who assist the Hunters. I am your advisor. You can submit your quests to me as well as ask me any of your doubts. I look forward to working with you, Arthas.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you. I did have a few questions and was wondering if you could answer them.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure. Ask away.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What is the next class advancement for Hunters?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! Thinking about a Class Advancement already? Quite ambitious I see. Good, I like it. Class Advancement is a complicated thing. There can be several branches you can be qualified for and several rare ones are unknown so you will have to figure them out for yourself. We, at the Hunter’s Lodge do have a few standard ones. You can check and see if you see something you like.” She brought out a brown coloured leather bound book from one of the cupboards behind her and handed it to me.</p><p><br></p><p>I opened the book and took a seat nearby.</p><p><br></p><p>The book explained about the Job System in quite details.</p><p><br></p><p>As Sasha told me earlier, the Job Trees were complicated.</p><p><br></p><p>Methods to reach till the T5 level was available quite easily.</p><p><br></p><p>It was when people wanted to go beyond T5 that the real problem began.</p><p><br></p><p>Not all classes had the same upper limit and if one cannot unlock a higher Class, they can never advance.</p><p><br></p><p>This makes a huge difference in their power levels.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, a level cap T5 will be level 150 while a level cap T6 will be level 210, getting 60 extra levels from the T6 Class.</p><p><br></p><p>And generally, all classes which are that advanced give a huge stat gain which makes a great difference.</p><p><br></p><p>Hundreds of stats of difference can make T6 Players be in a league of their own when compared to a common T5.</p><p><br></p><p>This is why most people kept the way to advance to higher Classes a secret and any type of knowledge about them was one of the most valuable products in this world.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, the social hierarchy of this world was greatly dependent on this as well.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, anyone with a T6 Class could be given the title of a noble by the government and they could rise in Rank as their Tier Increased. They could also open private Guilds of their own.</p><p><br></p><p>To put things into perspective, the King of this Country was a T8 Swordsmaster and was the strongest person in the country and there were only six such countries. Other countries only had T7 Kings and were far smaller.</p><p><br></p><p>Tier 9 Jobs were legendary and Tier 10 was almost the thing of Myths.</p><p><br></p><p>The Hunter Class Tree was also only up to T5 in this book.</p><p><br></p><p>It had several options for a T4 Job.</p><p><br></p><p>The standard one was the Ranger Class.</p><p><br></p><p>It was basically an advanced version of the Hunter Class.with greater stats and skills.</p><p><br></p><p>There were a few non-standard ones, one of which was something I qualified for example, Bounty Hunter and Mercenary.</p><p><br></p><p>There was also the fact that this book only contained the legal Class Trees Apart from these, there were the illegal Class Trees which are not included in the books.</p><p><br></p><p>Apart from this, many Jobs are race specific which means only people of certain races can get those.</p><p><br></p><p>For the Ranger Job, I just had to level up my Hunter to the max level and pass another test at the Hunter’s Lodge to get the badge.</p><p><br></p><p>The Ranger Class further branches off in three parts, Combat Ranger, Snipping Ranger, and Trapping Ranger. Unfortunately, the method to reach those was not recorded here. I will have to go to a bigger town or maybe the capital to find that.</p><p><br></p><p>Apart from this, the rarity of Classes also mattered as rarer Classes gave a greater stat gain and allowed someone to fight ones with higher Tier Classes.</p><p><br></p><p>There was also the fact that once someone reached T6, levelling up became extremely hard.</p><p><br></p><p>I also found something important.</p><p><br></p><p>Turns out that people are supposed to take their Hunter’s Test in towns not the villages.</p><p><br></p><p>There are however certain exceptions which can be made and that’s when someone hunts a Mutated Beast solo.</p><p><br></p><p>Originally, the Hunter’s Test in this town is actually easier than in the Redwick Village.</p><p><br></p><p>Fuck.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t know or I would have left for the town earlier.</p><p><br></p><p>I did note that I could change into a Knight after levelling up my Squire Class to full level and taking a test at the Knight’s Association.</p><p><br></p><p>I noted down whatever I could and bought several necessary things like the maps of the nearby area before leaving the building and checked out the other associations, before returning back to the Inn.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Azazel -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“The contract was made through a virtual interface. How did he do that?” He pondered as he moved away from the hospital bed.</p><p><br></p><p>Baraqiel was still sitting beside the bed, looking at his daughter.</p><p><br></p><p>He felt bad for his brother who finally got a chance to meet his daughter but it was under these circumstances.</p><p><br></p><p>Shaking his thoughts away, he decided to face the other people in the room. “So, any idea where this guy came from?” He asked Sirzechs who was standing between two beds with his mother and sister.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy had been under immense pressure.</p><p><br></p><p>The son of Lucifer was killed and hung on his very castle and the entire mine of their magic mineral was whisked away. The entire Underworld was in a state of alert.</p><p><br></p><p>People were terrified and riots were happening in several places and the four of them have been working overtime to soothe the rising tensions of the people.</p><p><br></p><p>The man couldn’t even spend time beside his trapped family member’s bodies…</p><p><br></p><p>The answer came from Ajuka instead. “There were no records found about this person. Who he is, where he came from, everything is unknown. We don’t even know how he formed contracts with those three or that Goddess Tiamat… was even alive for that matter.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah, tell me about it. I was the one who personally led the attack on Babylon under Father’s orders. We wouldn’t have dared to do so if she had been alive. Both she and her first husband were strong… far stronger than any of you can imagine. If they had been alive, even if Heaven had won, it would have been pyrrhic at best and we would have been slaughtered by other Pantheons. She was dead. If not, there was no way those guys in the Mesopotamian Pantheon would still be alive. She would have killed them without a doubt. She died and the Dragon King Tiamat was born from her remains.”</p><p><br></p><p>He took a deep breath. “And yet… she is somehow back. Did that guy…”</p><p><br></p><p>“How did he do it? Not to mention, Great Red and Ophis?”</p><p><br></p><p>The more he thought about it, the more of a headache he got.</p><p><br></p><p>He turned to look towards another person in the room. “Was… was Father actually exhausted from sealing that… that thing?”</p><p><br></p><p>Michael’s face took on a sad look and he nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>Azazel couldn’t even imagine a being that could force their Father to that extent… and that was just to seal it while it was asleep.</p><p><br></p><p>They moved out of the hospital room to a meeting room.</p><p><br></p><p>“What do you all know about this game?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Ajuka shook his head. “As much as others. We checked and it turns out that not even the employees who work in the company knew who they worked for. Everything was fake. The owner of the company didn’t know anything either. They were checked thoroughly and there weren’t any signs of tampering with their memories… or at least any that we could notice. They are currently under custody, being questioned by the governments of different countries about the way to end the game. It was due to this that several governments contracted us. Several other supernatural beings were contracted too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. We received several requests as well. Not that anyone would dare to accept those.” he shook his head.</p><p><br></p><p>The entire Supernatural world was shaken due to the example made of Rizevim. He might not be the strongest one in the world but he was quite up there on the Totem Pole. Not to mention the threat of releasing that thing and then coming out to deal with everyone by themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>“ By the way… what about that Thanos guy which the Gamemaster spoke of?” Michael asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“The Mad Titan, the purple guy and someone who had erased half the life of the universe?” He shook his head. “No. There has never been any records of any such beings. Not even the oldest of Gods knew of such a being. The Greeks are running around trying to find out any clues about this guy but to no avail.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I have heard that several Pantheons have taken to aim at Zeus after the mention of the Titan.” Michael said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh they did. People from all over the world were so publicly endangered. There has never been a case where a supernatural force had taken a direct action of this scale involving humans. Zeus is running around, panicking at the slightest of things since the reveal of that name.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I personally think that he was just trying to throw us out of the loop. I mean if someone had actually erased half the life of the Universe… we would have known.”</p><p><br></p><p>That was probably something he said to throw them out of the loop.</p><p><br></p><p>“Would we?” Ajuka asked and everyone in the room turned towards him.</p><p><br></p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p><br></p><p>“You didn’t notice the word he used. He said ‘universe’. Generally when we refer to our world, we use the word… ’world’, in some cases ‘planet’ for the human world or even ‘dimension’ but never ‘universe’.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So you mean…” He narrowed his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“We have never been able to find out what lies outside the Dimensional Gap because…”</p><p><br></p><p>His eyes widened in realisation. “Great Red guarded it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But Great Red is now with him… so he… did he mean the ones… outside the world?” Suddenly realising the true meaning of the words and then understanding the implications of the words… he found his mouth open.</p><p><br></p><p>“It is still my guess but it does make a lot of sense. I mean… how does such a powerful figure remain unknown? This explanation does provide a reasonable explanation for this.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The Mad Titan… are you saying that there is truly a being who erased half the life of the entire Universe?” Michael asked, shocked beyond words.</p><p><br></p><p>“But that kind of power… no. No, that’s impossible. It’s…”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>No one spoke anything, still trying to wrap their minds around the idea.</p><p><br></p><p>And that Game Master had spoken of such a being as if it was a casual thing….</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you all have any plans for… rescuing the ones trapped inside?” Baraqiel asked, breaking the silence which had enveloped the room.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at his brother and sighed. “It’s not like we don’t want to, Baraqiel but you must understand what would happen if anyone interrupts the game.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then we don’t interrupt it.” Baraqiel replied, gaining the attention of the people in the room.</p><p><br></p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The Game Master said that we cannot interrupt the game and that the game will only be stopped when it is completed… so… why don’t we send in some people to assist in completing the game?”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“You want us to send people inside to who knows what kind of danger? Baraqiel, I understand that you are worried but this is…”</p><p><br></p><p>“How is it any different from any missions we did before this? There is always the danger of the unknown, always a risk of life.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, for first, we don’t even know if what the Game Master said was true.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you think someone like <em>him</em> would have any reason to lie to us? You saw his power. The guy has the entire world in his hand right now. Why in the name of Father would he even lie?”</p><p><br></p><p>“But…”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s a good plan, Baraqiel.” A voice interrupted his sentence.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs had a serious look on his face. “What you said is without a doubt a viable plan. Can we have other people enter the game, Ajuka?”</p><p><br></p><p>Ajuka stared at Sirzechs for a while and then replied. “If we use other sources, it might be considered as interruptions but… if we could find other unused consoles and use those to connect… then maybe the Game Master wouldn’t interfere?”</p><p><br></p><p>“You guys want to risk it all on a ‘maybe’?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am willing to risk my life.” Sirzechs stood up and then turned to Ajuka. “Do you have any plans?”</p><p><br></p><p>Ajuka thought for a second… he was actually considering the insanity.</p><p><br></p><p>“Their official website wasn’t under the control of the employees and we couldn’t crack it. No one could find the place where it was being operated from. We could perhaps try contracting the Game Master through it. It’s a long shot but maybe we could ask permission.” He suggested.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs nodded. “Then we do it. If there is no reply in a week, we will discuss what to do next.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright.”</p><p><br></p><p>Azazel closed his eyes and let out a sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>This… was much better than just running in blind.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will try to do the same. Maybe some other factions will be interested in joining this….operation if we actually get a permission.” He spoke finally, looking at Baraqiel who nodded. “But you will not be going in.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Azazel!”</p><p><br></p><p>“No arguments on this, Baraqiel. I will send the best people we can find but I can’t afford to lose you at such a time.” he replied firmly.</p><p><br></p><p>Baraqiel stopped the argument too but he knew that he was not happy.</p><p><br></p><p>This whole mess was turning out to be such a pain.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Arthas -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“And that’s all I could find out.” I completed my side of the report.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s a lot of information to take in. I talked with some people around the town and visited the Merchant’s Association and the market. I had a letter of introduction from Madam Martha and found a place where I could work as an Apprentice Herbalist. The shop is actually run by her grandson, Luther and his wife Greta.” She explained.</p><p><br></p><p>A letter of introduction?</p><p><br></p><p>Gunter never gave me one of those.</p><p><br></p><p>Was it because of the affection levels?</p><p><br></p><p>Did the game even have such things?</p><p><br></p><p>I will have to find out more information.</p><p><br></p><p>“Will you be staying with them?” I asked. In the village, she stayed with Madam Martha so maybe she will stay there.</p><p><br></p><p>“Unfortunately they have no empty rooms at their place. It was different with Madam Martha as she was living there alone and I was offered a place. Luther and Greta have a whole family here. So I guess I will have to find a place to live till then. What about you? Where do you plan to stay?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I… don’t know. I will try to see if I can get any information about a fifth Tier Class change in this town or else I would have to move to the next town after I complete my T4 Class.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But that would still take around a month or two.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Possibly. I don’t know how much experience I can get from the monsters around this place.” My usual hunting methods will not work as the T3 and above Monsters would just knock down any trees I use as my base and they could also jump out of the holes so my levelling speed will be reduced by a lot.</p><p><br></p><p>“I was thinking about renting a place. Staying in the Inn is not economic. I found some places which are being rented. They are cheaper than staying in the Inn. It’s just that the budget is not something I can afford alone so I wanted to ask….will you like to share a house with me? I can cook.” She added with a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at her with a surprised look.</p><p><br></p><p>“You want to share a place with me? You don’t even know me well enough.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I like to think that I am a good judge of character.” She smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>I just looked at her blankly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh come on. Don’t tell me that you are planning to continue the rest of the game by yourself. You will look for teammates, right?”</p><p><br></p><p>“That….yes. It’s just that I hadn’t thought that much about it.”</p><p><br></p><p>But now that I think….she is a good option for the first party member.</p><p><br></p><p>She had fighting experience and could even teach me things and she had a good production class on the side.</p><p><br></p><p>And the thing she said about the budget was also true. I couldn’t stay in inns all the time.</p><p><br></p><p>I thought about it for a few moments and nodded. “Sounds like a plan.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Great! Then we can go and look at the place tomorrow.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay.” I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>We had dinner and left for our rooms.</p><p><br></p><p>I wanted to explore the areas in the Town at night to find information about the less pleasant side of the society but decided to refrain.</p><p><br></p><p>With my T3 Job, I could be a hot shot in Redwick but here? Things were different.</p><p><br></p><p>The absolute safety of the Beginner’s Village, didn’t apply to any other town.</p><p><br></p><p>The only places we could be safe were private houses and these inn rooms.</p><p><br></p><p>_______________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I woke up the next day and went downstairs for breakfast.</p><p><br></p><p>The inn offered a bucket of water for a coin to clean myself but no bathing facilities so I just brushed my teeth and wiped my body with a wet towel.</p><p><br></p><p>I will have to find a place to take a bath later on. I stink.</p><p><br></p><p>This game was extremely realistic which meant that the feeling of sweat and blood was also as real as it could get.</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes, it was very inconvenient.</p><p><br></p><p>Veena was already down there, waiting for me to order.</p><p><br></p><p>We had a quick breakfast and left to sell the things we had gotten from the hunt.</p><p><br></p><p>She took me to the Market area. As expected it was far bigger than Redwick.</p><p><br></p><p>“Llyne has eight villages under it similar to Redwick. I think each village must have players who will gather here. There were around four hundred players in our village alone so three thousand or so people are expected to gather here. This town also has a Teleportation Array so players can reach this place from any other big town of the Estar Country. The properties in this town are cheap right now but I think the prices will rise as more people reach here.” Veena explained as we walked through the market.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are planning to buy a place here?” I asked, surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>“It would be a good investment.” She commented offhandedly as we reached the place which she was searching.</p><p><br></p><p>Colt Blacksmith Shop.</p><p><br></p><p>“Luther suggested this place as the owner was a friend of his and from the Redwick village too.” She explained before entering.</p><p><br></p><p>I followed her.</p><p><br></p><p>Unlike the shop back in Redwick, this one had a counter and a room exhibiting all the things the shop sold.</p><p><br></p><p>There were several weapons and armour lining the walls of the shop and more in the glass cases placed in the middle of the room.</p><p><br></p><p>The weapons here were grades better than anything Redwich had. There were even some magic weapons.</p><p><br></p><p>A burly man came out after hearing us enter. “Whaddya two need?”</p><p><br></p><p>Veena stepped forward. “Hello. Are you Mr. Callum?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Tis me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I was recommended to this place by Mr. Luther.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Luther, that brat?” he asked, taking another look at us.</p><p><br></p><p>“We are from Redwick Village and caught a few things on our way here which we wanted to sell a few things and commission some equipment.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah Redwick. Been a while since I went there. How is old Braham doing? Still kicking?” He laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Mr. Braham seemed to be in good health. He is currently teaching an apprentice.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, the old fellow took an apprentice. Good for him.” He nodded. </p><p><br></p><p>I watched her talk with the guy as if they had known each other for ages. Seriously, this woman had a Speech Skill of 100.</p><p><br></p><p>“Come with me.” He led us to the back of the shop, his workshop I think.”Aight, show me what ya got.”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at me and I nodded. Pointing to an empty place in the corner of the room, I asked. “Can I use this place?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure.”</p><p><br></p><p>I unloaded everything from the inventory to the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>The man raised an eyebrow. “Ya two hunted this while coming here?” He got up and picked up a wolf hide. “How many weeks did the two of ya hunt?”</p><p><br></p><p>“We were lucky.” She smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, I don’t doubt that. This is the hide of a mutated Redwolf. That thing was the reason behind the name of the village. It is by far the strongest Mutated Beast in the area. Ya two are lucky beyond words to even survive let alone hunt all these.”</p><p><br></p><p>I raised an eyebrow at his comment.</p><p><br></p><p>No wonder the experience gained from that wolf was not reduced even when I was at a higher level. It was stronger than the boar.</p><p><br></p><p>Damn, I was realising how big of a shit I would have been in had I been alone back then. I looked at the woman beside me and felt thankful for her presence.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly, the idea of having a teammate felt quite good.</p><p><br></p><p>She haggled for the price of the goods and we equally divided the money between us. I offered her the hide and fangs of the wolf for her equipment.</p><p><br></p><p>Since she was going to be in a party with me, I would rather that she is well equipped.</p><p><br></p><p>The man said that he would get everything ready in a week so we just bought some general equipment for her.</p><p><br></p><p>Then she took me to the Alchemist Association and stocked up on some ingredients to make some of her special pouches for the hunt.</p><p><br></p><p>Next up on our list was the Adventurer's Association.</p><p><br></p><p>The Adventurer’s Association or ‘The Guild’ as they called it, was not a Association of Adventurer Class users only. Rather, it was a place where people posted their Quests and anyone who registered with them could take on these quests. Unlike the other Associations, Adventurer’s Guild took all sorts of tasks as long as they were not illegal.</p><p><br></p><p>In return, the guild collected a small fee for doing the job.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. It was a classic rpg Adventurer Guild.</p><p><br></p><p>Veena looked around the place curiously while I asked someone about where I could register and was pointed towards the registration counter.</p><p><br></p><p>The receptionist, Sena, gave up a form to fill and in fifteen minutes, we were officially Adventurers.</p><p><br></p><p>“Now, there are a few things you need to know before starting. Firstly the Ranks. Both Adventurers and Quests have different ranks. From lower to higher, they are Copper- Iron - Silver - Gold - Platinum - Mithril - Orichalcum - Adamantite. Your ranks can be seen from the colour of your identification plates.” Sena put a small metal plate in front of us and I paused.</p><p><br></p><p>“You can only take quests of your rank. Each quest has different conditions so be careful before taking them. Make sure you read the quest details carefully.” She explained several things to us and while she was doing all this, there was only one thing going on in my mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Is this an Overlord reference?</p><p><br></p><p>Was this a chance?</p><p><br></p><p>Will it trigger another achievement?</p><p><br></p><p>I was exposed as it is. There was no Hunter x Hunter in this world and I made a reference which was so far out of the blue that it would be strange if the Game Master didn’t catch me….and that was if the guy was blind enough to notice my name.</p><p><br></p><p>Arthas.</p><p><br></p><p>Fuck.</p><p><br></p><p>Using Arthas as a short for Arthur Strass was a stupid idea.</p><p><br></p><p>I even got the shitty luck of that poor bastard.</p><p><br></p><p>But back to the current situation… since I was already in deep water… I’d rather go with the flow and get everything I could out of this.</p><p><br></p><p>“So… with this, I welcome you… Mr and Miss?”</p><p><br></p><p>At this, I decided to take a dive of faith.</p><p><br></p><p>“Momon… and this is Nabe and we are… Ainz Ooal Gown!” I spread my arms and said in a grand manner.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a sudden period of silence in the whole guild as the people looked towards me suddenly.</p><p><br></p><p>Veena looked at me weirdly but I was looking at something else entirely.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Congratulations Traveller.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>You have discovered another secret!</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Reward: Undead Racial Classes will be unlocked without Race Change.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Keep working hard.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Traveller.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>A Special Title given to those who complete the Hidden Quests, Man of Culture.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>+2 to all stats.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>+4% to Exp Gained.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Note: The Effect of the Title can be enhanced the more secrets the Traveller discovers in the world.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>It worked.</p><p><br></p><p>It fucking worked.</p><p><br></p><p>Just how did this whole thing work?</p><p><br></p><p>Would it work anywhere or if I had said anything else?</p><p><br></p><p>I will think about it later.</p><p><br></p><p>For now, I smiled. “It’s a meme.” None of the two understood so I added. “Just joking. My name is Arthas and this is Veena. Nice to meet you, Miss Sena.”</p><p><br></p><p>The receptionist didn’t take my joke to heart either and completed the registration.</p><p><br></p><p>We left the place after asking her a few things.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at her. “Where to next?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The house.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay.”</p><p><br></p><p>Unlocking Undead Classes without Racial Change?</p><p><br></p><p>That was… awesome.</p><p><br></p><p>________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>A week had passed since we reached Llyne.</p><p><br></p><p>In the last week, Veena and I have been hunting regularly.</p><p><br></p><p>From my time in the Hunter’s Lodge, I found out that using lots of bait powder and camping in one place was a recipe to summon mutated animals. It was highly inadvisable. Sasha had coached me on some rules to follow while hunting and told me about the behaviours of some common animals around the town.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, that old fart, Gunter was just skipping work.</p><p><br></p><p>As for the hunts themselves, Veena was quite good at them.</p><p><br></p><p>She levelled up her Militia Class and then started working on her Apprentice Herbalist Class instead of going for another combat based class. I was the one who suggested this as we needed her to be able to make healing items soon.</p><p><br></p><p>Those fucking things cost a kidney.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the antidotes I had to buy cost me my entire day of earnings.</p><p><br></p><p>We generally hunted during the day and she made things to sell during the evenings, levelling the class from both sides and so we could get the class to full level in a week.</p><p><br></p><p>“So you have to take an exam for the Herbalist Rank at the Association?” I asked as I bit a piece of rabbit meat we had hunted yesterday.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. It won’t be hard as I have had enough practice. It is mostly for those who brute force the levelling of the class without actually practising the Skills.”</p><p><br></p><p>“... it’s called Power Levelling.” I corrected. I had come to realise that she didn’t know much about gaming after being with her for a week. She had just played this game because she was bored… and got caught in this mess.</p><p><br></p><p>The strangest thing however was that she didn’t look very worried about the situation itself and was actually enjoying herself.</p><p><br></p><p>According to her, this situation only had two ends. First, it gets solved, in which case, she would like to enjoy what little time she had in this world experiencing this novelty or second, it doesn’t get solved and we are stuck here for a while, in which case, we need to work hard to establish ourselves in this world first.</p><p><br></p><p>Either way, worrying and crying was not going to solve the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>It was cold but… there was truth in what she said.</p><p><br></p><p>In that way, Veena was quite strange. I always got the feeling that I was talking to someone quite old when I talked to her, despite our looks being exactly like our original bodies which meant she would be in her twenties at best.</p><p><br></p><p>She also had an odd sense of privacy.</p><p><br></p><p>We had rented a place on our third day and moved in together.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a small house with two rooms and most importantly… a bath.</p><p><br></p><p>More than once I had seen her in a towel, coming out of the bath or just a thin robe.</p><p><br></p><p>It wasn’t as if she was trying to seduce me or anything. I was extremely sure of that. It was more like….this was normal for her.</p><p><br></p><p>Oh she wasn't a slut or anything….just odd.</p><p><br></p><p>Another thing was that she was a good cook and we often saved a part of the game to cook for ourselves, saving us a lot of money.</p><p><br></p><p>She just laughed at my comment. “Yes yes. Power levelling. Anyways, I have already learned all the recipes and can proficiently make those items so there is no need to worry.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, the items you make are almost comparable to the ones we can buy.” I agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>Some Skills needed to be practised to raise their levels to make them more proficient.</p><p><br></p><p>More difficult skills had a higher level cap and sometimes, these skills got a special effect when levelled up completely.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, the Aim Eyes Skill which I had gotten from the Hunter Class had a ten percent chance of inflicting a Severe Bleeding Status on the target for 20 seconds.</p><p><br></p><p>My Shingen-ryu Skill had the highest level cap I had seen on any skill until now. It could be raised to Level 50 which meant I could gain 100 stat points in each stat at max level and an extra effect on top of that.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Shingen-ryu [Unique Skill] [Level 3] [Exp: 200/3000]</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Shingen-ryu or \"Style That Originates From The Heart\" is a school of Martial Arts in which the practitioner learns hand-to-hand combat as well as the ability to control their aura for combat.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Passively Increases +2 STR +2 END +2 DEX +2 INT +2 WIS per level.</strong></p><p><strong>Current Increase: +6 STR +6 END +6 DEX +6 INT +6 WIS.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I practised the skill when Veena was busy practising her Herbalist Skills.</p><p><br></p><p>I was realising how much of a cheat that one reference got me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, I will go out and hunt alone then.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Be safe dear.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>I left the house headed for the Adventurer’s Association first.</p><p><br></p><p>On the way, I saw another guy going towards the forest.</p><p><br></p><p>He had black hair and wore a pair of glasses. He looked like he was almost the same age as me.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy looked at me and stopped.</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm… are you also a… Soul Art Online?” He hesitated before asking.</p><p><br></p><p>“A player, yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>He breathed out, in relief.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hello, my name is Shiroe.” he bowed lightly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Arthas. Are you from Japan?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Uh yes. They mixed up all the servers and I don’t know where I am.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Well, considering what happened later, this is quite tame.”</p><p><br></p><p>He winced lightly but collected himself quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>We walked inside. </p><p><br></p><p>“Do you have any party members? Do you mind if we hunt together?” he asked, after hesitating a little.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at him for a moment before asking. “What class do you have?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I’m a Scholar.” He answered, surprising me. He noticed my surprise so he added. “You can get that class in the Academy after maxing up the Villager and Scribe Class.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, I know that already.” Both Veena and I took our time and received the class but didn’t level it up.</p><p><br></p><p>We had too much on our plates.</p><p><br></p><p>She was planning on levelling it after we max out her Herbalist Class.</p><p><br></p><p>“I just didn’t think anyone would get it this early.” After all, Scholar is a T3 Class just like my Hunter and Squire.</p><p><br></p><p>“I was able to utilise some things. As for the Scholar Class, it is mostly a support class. So I was looking for someone to team up with.” He said, embarrassed. </p><p><br></p><p>I thought for a moment and then decided to send him an invite.</p><p><br></p><p>He accepted and I saw his eyes widening. “Squire Level 20?!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you have anywhere you want to hunt?” I asked while checking his level. He was a Level 1 Scholar just as he had said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm, yes. There is a settlement of Goblins a bit away from here. We could hunt there. They are mostly T2 Monsters although some of them do use poisoned daggers.” He explained the plan to me in detail while we walked that way.</p><p><br></p><p>“How were you going to hunt them by yourself?” I asked, raising an eyebrow.</p><p><br></p><p>“They generally hunt in a group of three so I was planning to bait one group at a time, use a status effect and then finish them off. Before that, I needed to make maps and scrolls to level up my Scribe Class so I never had to fight.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Say… do you have any real fighting experience?” I asked, pausing a bit.</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm… I fought the boars… in a team.” he added lightly at the end, realising the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>I stopped.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s hunt something easier. Goblins are smart creatures and hunting them can be tricky if we have no understanding of each other’s skill. I think we should practise on normal enemies first.”</p><p><br></p><p>“….alright. I….didn’t think of that.”</p><p><br></p><p>We went to one of the places which I found in the past few days.</p><p><br></p><p>This place only had wild boars, something I had the most experience with.</p><p><br></p><p>I told him whatever I knew of the area so that he could take a good position, preferably on the top of a tree.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure you want to face them alone?” he asked, unsure.</p><p><br></p><p>“Shouldn’t be a problem.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then why don’t we use that area?” He pointed towards a cluster of rocks.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at him questioningly and he explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“If we could move the rocks into a circular formation, we could leave only one entrance and you wouldn’t be in any danger of being surrounded from other sides. I can get on top of the rocks and support you as well as keep an eye out for enemies from other sides. On a tree, the branches might cover us but it will also impede our viewing area.” He went on explaining a few things and I had to agree that the guy made some solid points.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, then let’s do it your way.”</p><p><br></p><p>We spent an hour making the setup and placing some traps according to his advice. In that time, I killed a few boars who had come across the area.</p><p><br></p><p>“This seems good enough. Alright, I have a few skills as a Scholar. Minor Fortification which increases Strength and Endurance by 5 Points for 15 seconds, Flash which blinds the target for 4 seconds and Stun Bolt which is my only attack Skill at this level and it has a 5% chance of stunning the enemy for 5 seconds.” He explained his skills and devised a strategy for the hunt.</p><p><br></p><p>I threw in the names of some of my skills and he changed his strategy to accommodate them.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy even knew about the appearance of stronger monsters in an area if we hunted too many of the same kind of monster.</p><p><br></p><p>Was he just that smart or was I just an idiot?</p><p><br></p><p>With everything ready, we decided to go big.</p><p><br></p><p>I brought a bait and threw it in the circle between the rocks and waited for the attack.</p><p><br></p><p>A minute later, Shiroe called out. “They are here. Five boars. All T2 Brace up. Minor Fortify.”</p><p><br></p><p>I felt a sudden rise in my strength and brought out my shield and held it high. We had some rocks in front of the entrance to break the charge of the boars.</p><p><br></p><p>As expected, they charged directly into the rocks and tumbled. I stopped the first boar with my shield and used my attack Skill, Swift Strike to chop down the first boar, beheading it in one strike.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Shiroe -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Amazing!</p><p><br></p><p>He took that down in one attack. As far as he had calculated, it would have taken Shiroe a dozen attacks per Boar with his Stun Bolt.</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, Squire could change into Knights and they were front liners and damage dealers. It would be weird if he couldn’t do that, especially since Arthas was by far the highest level among any person he had seen till now.</p><p><br></p><p>When coming here from the Blackwood Village, he hadn’t expected anyone to be in the first town, let alone someone like this.</p><p><br></p><p>A Level 20 T3 Squire.</p><p><br></p><p>Reaching level 20 in a T3 Job would take him around two and a half months….with a decent party.</p><p><br></p><p>Was this guy soloing everything till now?</p><p><br></p><p>Putting aside his thoughts, he cast a Stun Bolt on the highest level Boar and waited till Arthas dealt with the second one with the Skill he assumed was Shield Bash.</p><p><br></p><p>“Close your eyes.” He shouted.</p><p><br></p><p>A second later, he cast a Flash in the middle of the recovered group of three boars, blinding them.</p><p><br></p><p>Arthas was right on the follow up, charging his next attack for three seconds and slicing through the highest level Boar with ease and even throwing it on the other two.</p><p><br></p><p>The two boars recovered from their blindness and were thrown back.</p><p><br></p><p>He took this chance to cast another Stun Bolt on the higher level Boar and a stunned sign appeared on top of its head. “It’s stunned.”</p><p><br></p><p>Arthas didn’t waste any time either, using some kind of buff before jumping out and puncturing the eyes of the remaining boar.</p><p><br></p><p>The Skill reminded Shiroe of the Aim Eyes Skill which he had seen a guy, an Apprentice Hunter back in the Beginners Village using… but didn’t it use a bow and an arrow?</p><p><br></p><p>But he didn’t have much time to think as he took down the boar in his next three attacks, right in time for his Swift Strike to recover from the cooldown and use it on the Boar which had recovered from the Stun, taking it out in one blow.</p><p><br></p><p>Match.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole team of five T2 boars, which generally took a team of eight to collaborate for half an hour with traps… was taken out in less than a minute.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiroe suddenly had a new understanding of the game.</p><p><br></p><p>Despite whatever shit it had thrown them into… this game was far beyond anything he had faced in Elder Tales.</p><p><br></p><p>They quickly gathered the drops from the boars and got back in their position where he rested to recover his mana.</p><p><br></p><p>Fifteen minutes later, he saw another group of boars rushing in.</p><p><br></p><p>Those baits were quite effective.</p><p><br></p><p>Well it was time for the grind.</p><p><br></p><p>“Incoming, six boars this time.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Game Master -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! They have become smart.” He heard Red say and looked at her.</p><p><br></p><p>She in turn pointed towards the screen on which the forums were open. Not that they would be of any use with all the players trapped inside… but this was a Game he had designed. How could it lack anything? So he made a forum and let it be for the sake of formalities.</p><p><br></p><p>He checked the screen and saw a message.</p><p><br></p><p>It was some guy asking for permission to enter the game… enter the game?</p><p><br></p><p>He read it again and it said the same.</p><p><br></p><p>Oh!</p><p><br></p><p>“Who sent this?” he asked, as he read the rest of the message.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ajuka Beelzebub.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Heh! That guy is a smart cookie alright.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So, what are you going to do?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well… they want to play my game so I will let them play. Let them enjoy themselves.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I doubt they are going to enjoy it.” Red rolled her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh they are not. I know that. They are more than likely thinking about sending in reinforcements to complete the game quickly. The guy found the opening I had left in my warning. Just leave it to the Devils to find loopholes in contracts. But… what has that got to do with me? As long as they don’t disturb my game, they could sign Baby Shark in a pink tutu for all I care. Give them a go.”</p><p><br></p><p>“... Are you sure? If the number of people increases too much… would it affect the endgame plan?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No. I have prepared enough for twice the number of people. The endgame will not be affected. In fact, know what? Ask them to place an order for Nerve Gears on the forums and send in as many as they want.”</p><p><br></p><p>She shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>He made some adjustments to the system for the new people.</p><p><br></p><p>Since they wanted to enter the game, he would also accommodate them properly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why do you think they are doing this?” She asked while replying to his question.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, are any important devils trapped inside? Let me check.” He did a quick check and saw that almost half the family of the tomato head was inside the game. Apart from him, there were several other devil children.</p><p><br></p><p>Ah… that makes sense.</p><p><br></p><p>He checked the location of the people and saw an interesting thing.</p><p><br></p><p>Oh, was this the Mother of the Ketchup Head Satan?</p><p><br></p><p>And with him was….</p><p><br></p><p><em>“Momon… and this is Nabe and we are… Ainz Ooal Gown!”</em></p><p><br></p><p>Pfft….</p><p><br></p><p>He actually said that!</p><p><br></p><p>Looks like he has accepted the situation and was looking to milk the whole thing for everything that it was worth.</p><p><br></p><p>And he was with Satan Ketchup Head’s Mother of all people…</p><p><br></p><p>Was Gremory luck even a thing? But wasn’t she a Bael?</p><p><br></p><p>How did she find the one possible reincarnator in over twenty million people?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. The people dying permanently, was a lie.</p><p><br></p><p>They just got a different start…</p><p><br></p><p>He couldn’t let people die willy-nilly or it would defeat the entire purpose of the endgame plans he had in mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Shaking his head, he concentrated on his junior’s recent exploits.</p><p><br></p><p>He searched for a few things and a smile formed on his face.</p><p><br></p><p>Oh they were living together…</p><p><br></p><p>This was an interesting development.</p><p><br></p><p>Let’s see if anything comes out of it during the game.</p><p><br></p><p>Being a Game Master was quite an enjoyable job.</p><p><br></p><p>________________________________x__________________________________________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><a href=\"https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Happy New Year to everyone.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Look who’s back.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Arthas has accepted his situation and just as the Game Master said, he is going to milk it for all its worth….and it is going to be hilarious.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Both Arthas and Mama Gremory are out of the Beginner’s Village and are now working towards establishing themselves.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Arthas is not a Gary Stu so there are many areas which he can learn from and the characters he meets in the game and situations he encounters will help him grow into something greater.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>In the meanwhile, the entire world is shaken.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The Game Master doesn’t hold back and now everyone is searching for the Mad Titan.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Zeus is shitting bricks at the mention of an unknown Titan with that much power and everyone is after his ass as well.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ajuka’s guess….was so close and yet so far….poor guy.

The smell, the feel of the blade slicing through their bodies, their shouts, the resistance of their bones against my sword… everything.</p><p><br></p><p>It was probably the first bout of intense emotions I have had in such a long time and I… hated it.</p><p><br></p><p>I wanted some excitement in my life… but not like this.</p><p><br></p><p>“Close your eyes.” I heard Veena’s voice sounding in my ears.</p><p><br></p><p>I hesitated.</p><p><br></p><p>“You can see those scenes. I know. But the only way to drive away your fears is to face them up front. This… game will force us to do such things sooner or later. If you hesitate, it will be you who dies instead of them. So do this…”</p><p><br></p><p>I did.</p><p><br></p><p>“Take deep breaths. Calm your emotions.”</p><p><br></p><p>I did and calming down my emotions wasn’t exactly hard.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation did help.</p><p><br></p><p>She brought out a pack of incense and gave them to me.</p><p><br></p><p>“These have a calming effect on the mind. Normally they are used to calm down enraged beasts but they don’t have any side effects on humans. You can appraise them easily. Just light one of them and leave them beside your bed when you sleep.” She looked at me and added a few more words. “You can have Martha assess them if you want.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.” I brought out a dagger from my inventory and the girl reflexively took a defensive stance.</p><p><br></p><p>I grabbed the sharp end of the dagger and passed it on to her. “Your spear broke. You can keep this for the time being. It’s….not something you can buy in the village.”</p><p><br></p><p>She took the dagger and thanked me.</p><p><br></p><p>We both had received ‘drops’ from the kills.</p><p><br></p><p>It was money and some items they had equipped.</p><p><br></p><p>The game had a rule of only having a 2% chance of dropping an item in the inventory and even this was only reserved to a maximum of three items, each having their own separate probability.</p><p><br></p><p>But there <em>were</em> skills which can be used to steal items even from someone’s inventory in High Tier Classes.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, we had a 50% chance of drops on the equipped items.</p><p><br></p><p>But according to the developers, there were many hidden conditions which we had to figure out ourselves.</p><p><br></p><p>And despite the characters of those people, they had the highest levels in the village apart from Veena and me.</p><p><br></p><p>Not much was said between us and we both left for our own residences.</p><p><br></p><p>The hotel rooms were secure so I could finally relax.</p><p><br></p><p>I did appraise the pouch given to me by Veena but didn’t use them.</p><p><br></p><p>I just couldn’t bring myself to.</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully, I was too exhausted for everything and sleep overtook me.</p><p><br></p><p>I woke up a few times during the night but by the end of it, I was getting better.</p><p><br></p><p>Today was the day I would get my weapons and the custom ordered armour.</p><p><br></p><p>I took an hour to make a plan on how to face the mutated boar.</p><p><br></p><p>The meeting with Veena gave me an idea which I was not considering beforehand.</p><p><br></p><p>With the plan in mind, I got ready for the day.</p><p><br></p><p>My first stop was Martha’s shop.</p><p><br></p><p>I checked around but Veena was not there so I asked Martha and found out that she was in the back garden.</p><p><br></p><p>There were some talks in the village, basically people gossiping.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s when I realised that I didn’t know if the bodies of those people would just disappear. Or maybe someone saw them last night.</p><p><br></p><p>Either way, I didn’t want to think about them right now.</p><p><br></p><p>With Martha’s permission, I went to the back garden.</p><p><br></p><p>The garden was… well, bigger than I was expecting. Inside, there was a small cottage with a workbench in front.</p><p><br></p><p>Veena was working on something on the workbench.</p><p><br></p><p>She noticed me and gave me a light smile.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you feeling well?”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I wanted to ask you for something.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I saw that you were using the pouches as weapons. I was wondering if I could commission you to make some for me. The stronger the better.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Those pouches were something I made from the leftovers and won’t work on the higher level monsters.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I can get the items you need.”</p><p><br></p><p>She thought for a second. “What is the level of monster you are hunting?”</p><p><br></p><p>I paused for a second and she noticed my hesitation and was about to say something but I stopped her. “A Peak Tier 2 or maybe even a Tier 3.”</p><p><br></p><p>This information was something she actually needed to make suitable items so hiding would have been counterproductive.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at me in surprise for a moment and then spoke.</p><p><br></p><p>“Anything I make right now won’t be strong enough to affect them. I am just a Level 5 Gardener. I would need to be at least an Apprentice Herbalist for that.”</p><p><br></p><p>5 more levels.</p><p><br></p><p>“If you don’t mind me asking, how much would it take you to reach that level?”</p><p><br></p><p>She smiled. “I only get experience in that Class from the gardening work I do here. As you know, a Gardener isn’t really suitable for fighting so I had to use the Villager Class to level up.”</p><p><br></p><p>“How are the experience requirements?”</p><p><br></p><p>“A bit lower than the Villager Class.”</p><p><br></p><p>I thought for a while.</p><p><br></p><p>She was still Tier 1 in all her Classes, then… maybe it can work.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have a suggestion if you don’t mind.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh?~”</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“And that’s level 8. Just how many of these did you have?” She asked, looking at me in surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>“I cannot use them to gain experience after gaining a Tier 2 Class or rather a total level above 10 so they are pretty useless to me.” I replied while I took the money she had gained.</p><p><br></p><p>What I did was give her the items required to complete the collection quests Tier 1 people could do.</p><p><br></p><p>I had plenty of them due to my hoarding habits.</p><p><br></p><p>There were five different quests of this kind and could be done multiple times.</p><p><br></p><p>She did give me the rewards from the Quests back and only got the experience and in return, she would make the items for me for free.</p><p><br></p><p>I think it was a decent trade.</p><p><br></p><p>“We still need to go to two other places. With that, you can get to level 9 at the very least.”</p><p><br></p><p>After an hour, we got her to level 9 while I had over four thousand extra Gold in my inventory.</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay, this much will be enough. I can help you level up the last level or you can do gardening here while I get some more materials for Quests?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will go out and hunt.” She clenched her fist. “I will be able to manage with this.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at her for a second and nodded. Since she didn’t have a problem then who am I to say anything?”</p><p><br></p><p>I knew most of the outer forest like the back of my hand already, including the areas where the items for those quests spawn and there were still my bases at the top of the trees.</p><p><br></p><p>We reached one of these areas and the herbs had respawned.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t find any fresh tracks of the wild animals nearby either so we both got to collect the herbs and I set a few traps after which both of us hid in the base at the top of one of the trees.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is this how you hunt?”</p><p><br></p><p>“This is the safest method.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Can’t argue with that. So, what kind of animals live here?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Mostly boars. Sometimes there are snakes but those are rare.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Boars eh? Let me help then.” She brought out a pouch from her bag, lit the corner of the bag with fire and threw it on the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>“What’s that?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Bait. Boars love the scent of Wild Violet Berries. The bag contains the dried peels of these berries. Their smoke is generally used to repel insects but can also be used as bait for Boars. They get drunk from this smoke. I mixed them with Blue Lilies which increased their smell even more.”</p><p><br></p><p>I listened to her explanation in surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>The game was really detailed, to even put so much thought to these little things.</p><p><br></p><p>But then another thought struck me.</p><p><br></p><p>I was going to hunt a mutated boar.</p><p><br></p><p>“Can I order one of these?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure. Treat this as a thank you gift.”</p><p><br></p><p>Our talk was interrupted by a sound as I signalled her to be quiet.</p><p><br></p><p>The sound grew louder.</p><p><br></p><p>And a few moments later, a fucking hoard of boars came running to that area.</p><p><br></p><p>The craziest thing was that even though the initial bunch fell into the trap I had dug along with the burning pouch, the others… jumped into the hole themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>Isn’t this bait too crazy?</p><p><br></p><p>We waited for sometime as the smoke took effect after which I handed her a spear and brought out one myself.</p><p><br></p><p>After that, it was like hunting fish in a barrel… or boar in a hole.</p><p><br></p><p>Within half an hour, she was a Level 2 Apprentice Herbalist.</p><p><br></p><p>I, on the other hand, took the chance to level up another Tier 2 Job which I had gained somehow- Militia.</p><p><br></p><p>My personal guess was due to the thing which happened last night.</p><p><br></p><p>Apprentice Hunter was without a doubt the best class to level up right now and had some extremely vital skills to survive but Militia had better stat gains.</p><p><br></p><p>I prioritised my speed of growth first as I could always level up the rest of the Classes later, after I got a good set of Skills.</p><p><br></p><p>Now was such a time.</p><p><br></p><p>Unfortunately we didn’t have much time so I could only bring it up to level 3 and changed back to Apprentice Hunter to return back.</p><p><br></p><p>The harvest was great but now was the time for the real hunt.</p><p><br></p><p>We returned back to the village quickly and Veena went back to prepare the set of items for me while I went to get my weapons from the shop.</p><p><br></p><p>Everything was ready in half a day and while this was a bit later than what I originally had in mind, it was still much safer than before.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure you don’t want my assistance? I might not be as strong as you but I wouldn’t be a burden either.” Veena asked, as she handed me the pouches.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you for offering but this is a solo quest.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, too bad. Take care and be safe.”</p><p><br></p><p>With everything done, I took a leave from the village.</p><p><br></p><p>The next part was going to be hard.</p><p><br></p><p>I reached the area where the Mutated Boar was said to live.</p><p><br></p><p>The place itself was on one of the deeper sides of the forest.</p><p><br></p><p>I scouted the area and cleared some of the wild animals in the area to get the area ready for work.</p><p><br></p><p>Digging the place was harder as I was often interrupted by animals and had to face them and even that was hard as this area had high level animals.</p><p><br></p><p>With the hole dug, I placed several spikes with poisoned tips inside the hole to injure the boar when it fell. After that, I chose an old enough tree to make a base.</p><p><br></p><p>I had no idea how strong the mutated Boar would be but it was probably top of T2 or T3 at the very least.</p><p><br></p><p>A weaker tree could get knocked out and I would be fucked.</p><p><br></p><p>With everything done, I decided to locate the boar and bait it there.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the best parts about tracking such animals was that there were barely any animals around where the boar lived.</p><p><br></p><p>To bait it, I used the special bait Veena had prepared.</p><p><br></p><p>I placed several of them above the trap and lit them and placed several fruits and nuts on top of it as I waited for the effect.</p><p><br></p><p>The place was covered with smoke instantly and the wind blew it towards the boar’s habitat.</p><p><br></p><p>It was what happened next that I was not expecting.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a loud grunting sound from the distance and I prepared myself.</p><p><br></p><p>A second later, I felt tremors and they got larger and it was followed by a loud crashing sound.</p><p><br></p><p>From the top of the tree, I could see that small trees were being uprooted in the direction from which the boar was coming.</p><p><br></p><p>I nocked an arrow as I held my breath, preparing for the attack.</p><p><br></p><p>A figure jumped from the direction of the sound.</p><p><br></p><p>And finally I could see it clearly.</p><p><br></p><p>Black hide and large white tusks. It was almost double the size of the few T2 Boars I had hunted in the past.</p><p><br></p><p>The unique thing about it was probably the horn on top of its head which was red in colour and sometimes embers lit the tip.</p><p><br></p><p>Magic.</p><p><br></p><p>We still had no idea how to get a mage class here.</p><p><br></p><p>But I didn’t have time to let my thoughts stray much as the boar jumped directly at the fruits, crashing and falling into the pit and directly into the spikes.</p><p><br></p><p>A loud screech resounded in the area and a burst of fire came out from the pit.</p><p><br></p><p>I waited with bated breath and saw that the Boar actually got up and actually tried jumping.</p><p><br></p><p>Even with its hurt leg, its jump was too high for my comfort so I let go of the arrow, directly shooting its eye as it tumbled back into the spikes with a loud screech once more.</p><p><br></p><p>Without waiting for it to recover, I nocked another arrow and let it fly.</p><p><br></p><p>After a total of five arrows, the beast stopped moving and I got a notification.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>You have killed a Mutated Flame Boar.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>+10,000 Exp Gained.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Level Up.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Militia: 11(2200/2200)</strong></p><p><strong>+33 STR +33 END +22 DEX</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I quickly stored the drops but the trouble hadn’t ended there.</p><p><br></p><p>The loud noises were going to attract other animals and I didn’t have much time to run so I got back on the tree again but not before throwing the large boar’s corpse inside my inventory.</p><p><br></p><p>Sure enough, within minutes, the whole area was filled with many animals.</p><p><br></p><p>Many of them fell into the trap in the commotion while some stood surrounding the hole in the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>I for one wasn’t going to let this chance go so I quickly started sniping the animals one after another.</p><p><br></p><p>The thing with changing Classes was that I could only equip 1 class of each Tier at a time and I got the stats of only the equipped classes, though the active skills remain even if they are 50% less powerful.</p><p><br></p><p>So with the Level 20 Apprentice Hunter switched out with a Level 11 Militia, my damage was reduced by a lot but even then the poison made by Veena was very useful.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a total massacre.</p><p><br></p><p>In the next few hours, I was able to level up my Militia Class to level 18 not to mention the drops and in the end, I ended up sleeping on the tree itself.</p><p><br></p><p>By the time I returned back to the village, it was the afternoon of the next day.</p><p><br></p><p>I went straight to Gunter’s Hut.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh Arthas, it’s you lad. How was your hunt?” he asked.</p><p><br></p><p>I noticed the people around me but right now I was not in the mood to delay.</p><p><br></p><p>“I would like to complete the quest for the Hunter’s Examination.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You completed the Quest! My my, that was quite fast if I do say so myself. Well, what are you waiting for, show me your Badge.”</p><p><br></p><p>I passed on my Apprentice Hunter Badge to the guy and he did something to check it.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well….there was a talk about a secret final exam that the candidates have to find out for themselves.” He said, scratching his chin.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>At this point, I was getting irritated.</p><p><br></p><p>Sleeping on a fucking tree can make people irritable. Dulled emotions or not.</p><p><br></p><p>And thus, a few words slipped out of my mouth.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh come on, do I need to learn Nen now?!”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Congratulations!</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>You have unlocked a secret Achievement.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Man of Culture!</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Title Gained: Traveller</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Reward: Unique Skill: Shingen-Ryu.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Keep seeking more of these secrets hidden in the world of Arcana.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p>I stood there still….looking at the notification in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>“You’ve got to be kidding me.”</p><p><br></p><p>At this point, there wasn’t a doubt in my mind.</p><p><br></p><p>The Game Master….he was a transmigrator like me.</p><p><br></p><p>Gunter looked at my shocked look and laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry. Those are just rumours. You have passed the exams. These are just the exams for a Hunter and you did great. Here lad, have your badge.”</p><p><br></p><p>He handed me a badge which I took absentmindedly.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the Quest completion in front of me was not enough to get over the shock.</p><p><br></p><p>Gunter handed me a new Badge.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Hunter’s Badge.</strong></p><p><strong>+5 STR +5 END +5 DEX</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>T3 Class: Hunter Unlocked</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Congratulations on being the first one from your Region to advance to a 3rd Tier Class.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Title Gained</strong></p><p><strong>One Among a Thousand</strong></p><p><strong>+20% increased Exp Gain.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Keep doing your best, Traveller.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I looked at notifications and instantly observed the difference.</p><p><br></p><p>The last time I remember it was addressing me as ‘Player’ instead of a ‘Traveller’.</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly checked the Title I had received.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Traveller.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>A Special Title given to those who complete the Hidden Quests, Man of Culture.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>+1 to all stats.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>+2% to Exp Gained.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Note: The Effect of the Title can be enhanced the more secrets the Traveller discovers in the world.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I couldn’t help but look up at the sky.</p><p><br></p><p>The Game Master.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Sirzechs Lucifer -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the sleeping figures of his family members.</p><p><br></p><p>It had been a day since they had fallen unconscious and entered the <em>Game</em>.</p><p><br></p><p>When the announcement appeared in the skies of the Underworld, many of them had been taken aback.</p><p><br></p><p>Such a feat couldn’t be achieved by a normal man. This was someone far beyond him in power.</p><p><br></p><p>Most of the people in the Underworld didn’t even understand what was happening as human games were not that easily available in the Underworld and thus were not that popular.</p><p><br></p><p>It was almost eight hours in that he was informed about Rias and her peerage by her Knight, the only one who had been out for a contract.</p><p><br></p><p>While he was there to investigate her condition, he was informed that his mother and Grayfia were both in the same condition.</p><p><br></p><p>Apparently mother had wanted to try the game she had heard about from Rias and had dragged Grayfia into it too.</p><p><br></p><p>They were not moved from the place carelessly, fearing that it might stop the game and take their lives.</p><p><br></p><p>Ajuka himself made sure that they could be brought to the Underworld and to the Gremory Mansion without disturbing the Game.</p><p><br></p><p>He was still getting updates about the devils who had been in the same situation.</p><p><br></p><p>The game Soul Art Online was massively popular as a marvel of technology and even Ajuka had praised it.</p><p><br></p><p>This had resulted in several devils playing the game.</p><p><br></p><p>And not only Devils, several members of other pantheons had done so as well and now each and every one of them were in a similar situation.</p><p><br></p><p>“Can’t you do anything, Ajuka?” He asked his friend who had been checking up on them.</p><p><br></p><p>Ajuka got up and looked at him and shook his head. “The Magic is too strong and with the soul involved, I cannot take the risk. It would be beyond repair if something were to go awry.”</p><p><br></p><p>He gritted his teeth as his power leaked out a bit.</p><p><br></p><p>“Control yourself, Sirzechs. There are patients.” His father chided and he quickly reigned in his powers.</p><p><br></p><p>Taking a deep breath, he forced himself to calm down. “I am sorry. I lost my composure for a moment.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I know you are worried. I am too. But at such a time, losing your calm will not help anyone.” His father explained slowly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes father.”</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly, the door to the room opened and a servant rushed in.</p><p><br></p><p>“M-my Lord. T-t-there’s a body hanging from the top of Lucifer Castle.” The man looked pale.</p><p><br></p><p>“What! Whose body is it?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I-i-it’s….Rizevim Livan Lucifer.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Before he could get over his shock and ask more, he heard a familiar sound and rushed towards the window to see the same screen in the sky once more.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Game Master -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the faces of the people of the Underworld, staring at the sky.</p><p><br></p><p>As he had expected, someone had tried to mess with his plans and it was none other than the spoiled son of Lucifer.</p><p><br></p><p>So he decided to show them the consequences of such actions.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well hello everyone. I didn’t expect to see everyone so soon….oh who am I kidding. Of course I did. I knew there would be idiots who wouldn’t pay attention to my warning. Seriously, was it so hard? I did warn you about Angry Me, didn’t I? And guess who it was?”</p><p><br></p><p>He paused a bit to let them digest the information as the screen changed to the top of the Lucifer Castle where the dead body of Rizevim was hanging.</p><p><br></p><p>“Bingo! It was the spoiled son of Lucifer. Seriously, these idiots have more pride than they are worth. Did he think he was special because his daddy was the Big Bad Devil? Or was it because he was a so-called <em>Super</em> Devil? The dumb moron was the weakest of all three of his kind and yet had the biggest ego among them.”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the ugly looks on the faces of the devils.</p><p><br></p><p>“You morons put too much weight on that silly title and in doing so you forget a very simple thing….a super ant….is still an ant. I can eat them for breakfast lunch and dinner and not even burp. So….know your fucking place. I am not like others who would bear your tantrums for the sake of world peace. I would simply erase anyone who annoys me. If that’s the whole race….then so be it. Is that understood? And this….” He pointed towards Rizevim’s body “Was just a small example.”</p><p><br></p><p>The entire underworld had gone silent.</p><p><br></p><p>“It seems that I need to show how serious I am about my Game. Then so be it. Let me repeat myself once more, for the last time. The only way the game will end is if the players win the game. If anyone tries to use any other way, well hold on a moment, let me show you what I will do.” He shifted the camera to another location .</p><p><br></p><p>The screen was filled with the sight of a large beast with characteristics coming from different animals like a lion, a leopard, a bear, a dragon, etc. It has seven necks, seven heads, with ten horns, as well as seven long thick tails of different shapes. It also has four stout arms and two legs that are even thicker than its arms. Its main body is that of a primate leaning forward and is covered in black fur and what appears to be scales all over its body. Its size is well over several hundred metres.</p><p><br></p><p>Even through the screen, anyone could feel the strength of this beast.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is ’The Beast of Apocalypse - 666’, the Beast that brings the end of the world and all. You must have heard about it in many of the myths, even in the Bible… Oh, especially in the Bible. After all, the being the God of the Bible had locked up even knowing that it might lead to his own end. ‘The Beast Of Apocalypse - 666’ or as it is called, Trihexa.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The Big Guy from the Bible was severely weakened due to sealing him after all. He was barely at 5% of his power in the Great War. What? How could you little Devils and Fallen Angels ever dream of matching him at full power? The so-called Super Devils of the current age would have been snivelling babies in front of ‘THE Big Guy’.” He laughed and none of the Devils or Fallen Angels on the screen spoke.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nah… the guy was dying as it was, so he decided to cull the numbers to such a degree that the leftovers didn’t battle even if it was just to save themselves from extinction. Anyways, let’s not go off topic. So, if anyone tries to stop or even interrupt the game, I will release our little pet in their houses.”</p><p><br></p><p>He then paused and looked at them, his lips curling up into a smirk. “Oh, and if they by some <em>pfft</em> divine miracle, survive that, I will,” He zoomed out to show himself and his three lovers, “take personal fucking action against them.”</p><p><br></p><p>With his speech done, he decided to show them a small glimpse of what he could do. “Now for the punishment for the ones who made the first offence. Don’t worry. I am not a beast. I will not take any more lives today. But something needs to be done to keep you idiots reminded of the consequences.” The screen shifted towards a familiar floating island.</p><p><br></p><p>Agareas.</p><p><br></p><p>He snapped a finger and the entire island was covered in bright light, completely vanishing.</p><p><br></p><p>“No more fancy chess pieces for you. I believe you have already recovered your population enough. Now think about managing them properly rather than keeping on increasing them with disposables. Alright, gotta go. I have a game to supervise. Ciao. Keep being good children or the Angry Me might come next time and go full Thanos on you.” He looked at the confused looks of the people.</p><p><br></p><p>“What, you all don’t know Thanos? The guy who wiped out half the life in the Universe in his over-the-top family planning scheme? The purple guy. ‘I am inevitable’ ‘Snap’ Thanos? Tch, what uncultured people.”</p><p><br></p><p>With that he shut the screen off.</p><p><br></p><p>“Seriously!

That he sure did.</p><p><br></p><p>“And it seems that this junior of mine was quite bored of his normal life.” Or else, he would have never jumped into ‘SAO’ of all things. “In that case, let’s see how he does.” At least the work he had put into all those hidden references all over the game wouldn’t go to waste.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Arthas -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I went back to my room and closed the door.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly the safety of the room didn’t seem that comforting anymore.</p><p><br></p><p>My heart was beating fast.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly I recalled the advice Veena had given me and forced myself to calm down and took a deep breath.</p><p><br></p><p>Once I calmed down, I analysed the situation over and over and came to the conclusion that… worrying didn’t help me at all.</p><p><br></p><p>If the guy wanted to harm me, I would be dead no matter what I tried since I was almost surely exposed.</p><p><br></p><p>But if he didn’t… then I would just be wasting my time and energy worrying.</p><p><br></p><p>The thing I needed to do now was to concentrate on the game and find a way to clear it.</p><p><br></p><p>When this thought came to my mind, slowly but surely my worries settled down.</p><p><br></p><p>I shifted my attention to the next thing on the list.</p><p><br></p><p>With a T3 Job now, I couldn’t stay in this village anymore so I had to move from this place to the nearby town.</p><p><br></p><p>Technically I could have moved right after I had achieved a T2 Class but Hunter was a very useful Class and this place had it and I was also in a race against time to get to the T3 Class for the bonus.</p><p><br></p><p>20% Exp Gain boost was a lot especially considering how much exp I would need in the next tiers.</p><p><br></p><p>There was also the Shingen-ryu Skill.</p><p><br></p><p>And damn was it broken.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Shingen-ryu [Unique Skill] [Level 1] [Exp: 0/1000]</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Shingen-ryu or \"Style That Originates From The Heart\" is a school of Martial Arts in which the practitioner learns hand-to-hand combat as well as the ability to control their aura for combat.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Passively Increases +2 STR +2 END +2 DEX +2 INT +2 WIS per level.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t even know what the max level for this Skill was.

So, what are your plans now?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am planning to leave for the town.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Already? Then again, this village doesn’t have anything more to offer you so that makes sense.”</p><p><br></p><p>“How is your leveling going?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Better than I was expecting. I put up a small stall near the village centre, offering to make medicines and items for people who could bring me raw materials and pay a small fee. They were quite excited and offered me several jobs. I levelled up by three levels today.”</p><p><br></p><p>Three levels just by sitting in safety and making some powders…</p><p><br></p><p>Production Classes could be such utter cheats.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you planning to go the Production Routes all the way?” I asked. From what I had seen of her, she was trained in combat and I didn’t think she would let that talent go to waste.</p><p><br></p><p>And just as I had expected. “No. Production Classes can only help me so much. I decided to use this to gain some levels first as, while not comparable to combat classes, these classes still give decent stats. And having a way to earn some money safely never hurts. Although the speed of levelling is slowing down a bit in this place. I think I might move to the town too. Could I hitch a ride?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. Sure. The route to the town is relatively safe.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then I will provide for the items we need on the way.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Deal.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So when are we leaving?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Tomorrow morning.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t waste any time, do you? But then again, as the saying goes, the early bird catches the worm. Sure. I will inform Madam Martha about it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“At the village gates at 6 in the morning. It would be the best time to leave so that we can cover the most distance while it’s daytime.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright.”</p><p><br></p><p>We talked for a bit while we ate our dinner.</p><p><br></p><p>She left early as she needed to pack her stuff.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t mind her tagging along as making connections was essential in a VRMMORPG. I couldn’t beat the game alone.</p><p><br></p><p>She seemed like the social type.</p><p><br></p><p>As for myself, I sucked at it due to my condition.</p><p><br></p><p>Surprisingly, she didn’t seem bothered with it, almost as if she was used to it, and thus it felt comfortable to talk to her.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>Next day, I was at the gate of the village by six in the morning.</p><p><br></p><p>Veena came soon after.</p><p><br></p><p>“I prepared some food for the way.” She showed me a basket before putting it back into her inventory.</p><p><br></p><p>I always carried some emergency food to last me a week or so but this helps I guess?</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded at her. “Let’s go.”</p><p><br></p><p>There was a fairly clear path from the village to Llyne.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you know what you are going to do after reaching Llyne?” She asked me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, try to find out information about advanced Tier Classes. T3 is not enough.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Any ideas on what route you want to take?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Combat. Hunter is a good and balanced class but lacks the damaging skills necessary. I might try for other classes. Maybe a Knight or something. What about you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I prefer fighting from a distance. I might search for any magic classes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! You know how to gain those?” I asked, surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hehehehe I talked to Madam Martha as well as her circle of friends often and they told me a way to get started if I wanted to learn magic.”</p><p><br></p><p>“How?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Become a Scholar.” She replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“At least for the basic Magician Classes, getting a Scholar Class is the first step. It opens up several routes. From there one can decide what kind of path they want to follow. There is an academy in the town which can give you the Scholar Class on completing a quest.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. It does sound reasonable.” I replied, while in thought.</p><p><br></p><p>On the way, we discussed several topics.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you not going to join any groups? Hunting is going to become progressively challenging at the higher levels. It won’t be easy if you want to solo things.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I….might join a guild if I find a suitable one.” I said after some thought.</p><p><br></p><p>Right now I have too much going on in my mind.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Getting along with your team members is the most important thing or you won’t be able to trust them with your back in live combat.” She replied, getting a faraway look in her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>This girl….she was really experienced in combat.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, this should have been obvious when she wasn’t shaken from killing those thugs that day.</p><p><br></p><p>But that also made her a reliable partner if she somehow joined me.</p><p><br></p><p>“I was planning to level up a bit on the way. Do you mind?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh why not? While making Herbal Mixtures is a good way to gain experience, it’s terribly boring. Do you have somewhere in mind?”</p><p><br></p><p>“There’s a place nearby with a pack of wolves.”</p><p><br></p><p>I opened the map and showed her the place and we decided on a spot to hunt from.</p><p><br></p><p>We were in a hurry so I didn’t have the time to dig a hole and camp there.</p><p><br></p><p>“We will need something to hide our scent.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Scent?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The wolves have a very sharp sense of smell. They would easily catch us if they smell us.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then what do you suggest?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Normally, I use mud to cover myself….but even some strong smelling leaves wrapped around our bodies work.” I added, knowing that ladies would generally be averse to getting dirty.</p><p><br></p><p>She apparently sensed this and looked at me with a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>“I can see why you are so ahead of others. You don’t mind getting yourself dirty to reach your target. Something a lot of kids from my place could learn. Don’t mind me. Leaves might work but they won’t be as good.” She pointed to a pond nearby. “We can get ourselves clean here after the hunt. Anyways, I haven’t had a chance to experience this for a long time. It’s like I am starting my training all over again. Brings back some memories.”</p><p><br></p><p>I couldn’t help but ask. “You have experienced combat? You look very young.”</p><p><br></p><p>She smiled. “Oh my, asking a woman their age is a no no.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am sorry.” I quickly apologised.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hehehehe don’t worry. It was nothing.”</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t speak anything further and I didn’t probe either. We were not that close yet.</p><p><br></p><p>We quickly got ready, equipping our armour and covering ourselves in mud.</p><p><br></p><p>I saw that she didn’t hesitate even for a moment and my respect for her grew a bit.</p><p><br></p><p>We ventured inside the forest and I found a tree for us and quickly made ourselves comfortable.</p><p><br></p><p>For bait, I brought out the meat of the boars I had hunted and tied it to a nearby tree. Veena brought out a pouch of poison and smeared it on the meat.</p><p><br></p><p>Huh.</p><p><br></p><p>I wasn’t doing that before.</p><p><br></p><p>But then again, I used to hunt for boars whose meat could be eaten.</p><p><br></p><p>Wolf Meat is hard and tastes like shit so it didn’t matter.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, I looked at her and decided to test something for the first time.</p><p><br></p><p>I opened the Party option and sent her an invite.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked surprised for a moment but accepted it.</p><p><br></p><p>And then the hunt started.</p><p><br></p><p>The Grey Back Wolves of this area were all T2 beasts and actually had a good sense of smell. There were sounds of growling from the nearby bushes within minutes and we waited with bated breaths.</p><p><br></p><p>A pack of five wolves appeared and I was about to shoot when Veena stopped me, shaking her head.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let them eat.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at her for a moment and agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>The wolves bit and tore off the bait from the tree and started eating it then and there and within minutes, they began stumbling into the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sleeping Powder.” She smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>Oh!</p><p><br></p><p>So that wasn’t poison.</p><p><br></p><p>With such easy targets in front of me, I started the attack and within seconds the entire pack of wolves were down.</p><p><br></p><p>I went down and replaced the bait and Venna did the same but she actually gutted the wolves in the place and let the blood cover the area.</p><p><br></p><p>“The smell will attract more wolves.”</p><p><br></p><p>With this in mind, we quickly stored the body of the wolves in our inventory and got back up on the trees.</p><p><br></p><p>Five hours in, we had hunted twenty five wolves.</p><p><br></p><p>I noticed that she had changed her class to Militia.</p><p><br></p><p>It seems that she had received that class as well.</p><p><br></p><p>My Militia Class experience was full and I got a notification.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>T3 Class: Squire Unlocked</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>T3 Class: Guard Unlocked</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>T3 Class: Apprentice Swordsman Unlocked</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>T3 Class: Apprentice Spearman Unlocked</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>T3 Class: Novice Archer Unlocked</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Several announcements appeared in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>Wow.</p><p><br></p><p>So many options.</p><p><br></p><p>After a minute of thought, I chose Squire.</p><p><br></p><p>Squires can become Knights which is a fairly balanced Class with offence and defence. I had it in mind for a while.</p><p><br></p><p>It was then that something happened that I was not expecting.</p><p><br></p><p>A howl sounded in the area and several others soon joined it.</p><p><br></p><p>The total number was almost twenty from what I could make out.</p><p><br></p><p>This is a bit beyond my expectations.</p><p><br></p><p>We hid in the branches and looked down.</p><p><br></p><p>What came out of the bushes this time was a wolf, almost twice as large as the normal ones and the most unique thing about it was the unique red colour of its fur.</p><p><br></p><p>Son of a bitch.</p><p><br></p><p>Was this the area where the mutated Wolf hunted?</p><p><br></p><p>I had not investigated its hunting grounds after I had excluded it from the list.</p><p><br></p><p>The wolves had red eyes and I saw the Bloodlust status on them.</p><p><br></p><p>They were not even paying attention to the meat in front of them.</p><p><br></p><p>This was bad.</p><p><br></p><p>We didn’t move and kept still.</p><p><br></p><p>I could fight and even win against the normal wolves but against the Mutated One, especially with an entire pack….that would be hard.</p><p><br></p><p>I never faced this situation before because of the pits I dug normally.</p><p><br></p><p>We kept waiting for them to leave but instead of leaving, even more appeared and by the end of the next fifteen minutes, there were around fifty of them.</p><p><br></p><p>Veena looked and messaged me.</p><p><br></p><p>“We target the boss. Currently, that’s the only wolf which can harm us by trying to break the tree. I will try to weaken it and you take it down. We will take care of the others after that.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sounded like a good plan so I nodded and she brought out a heap of pouches from her inventory.</p><p><br></p><p>“Cover your face.” She warned before she tied a scarf on her face as a mask.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at her in astonishment and she gave me a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>Even in this dangerous situation, she was smiling so calmly.</p><p><br></p><p>Just who is this woman?</p><p><br></p><p>I, however, didn't have the time to think about these things right now.</p><p><br></p><p>I nocked a poisoned arrow onto my bow and took aim and made eye contact with her.</p><p><br></p><p>In a moment of mutual understanding, she threw a pouch directly at the red furred wolf’s eyes and it looked up immediately as the whole area was covered with a red dust.</p><p><br></p><p>I realised that she was using the same thing as me.</p><p><br></p><p>Chilli Powder.</p><p><br></p><p>By then I had already prepared one of my new Hunter Skills.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Aim Eyes.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>And let the arrow go, straight to the wolf’s eye.</p><p><br></p><p>It let out a loud growl and all the wolves started growling but unable to reach us.</p><p><br></p><p>The red powder was burning their eyes and Veena wasn’t letting up on her assault as she rained several different pouches down on them, one after another.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t stop either as I rained arrows after arrows on the mutated wolf, using my other Skills in quick succession.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Aim Legs.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Disable.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Lethal Shot.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>In just a minute, the wolf pack was full of status effects.</p><p><br></p><p>They were not retreating due to the Bloodlust effect which was clouding their judgement and kept on trying to jump on the tree to get to us.</p><p><br></p><p>The weaker ones started falling one after another.</p><p><br></p><p>The Mutated Wolf decided to take action on its own and opened its mouth as embers of fire formed inside.</p><p><br></p><p>Magic.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t give it any chance however, shooting directly inside its mouth.</p><p><br></p><p>The Magic was cancelled and it stumbled down.</p><p><br></p><p>With the combined assault, the wolf was down after five minutes.</p><p><br></p><p>By then, the rest of its pack had either fainted or died from the effects of the pouches.</p><p><br></p><p>I kept shooting them but didn’t go down.</p><p><br></p><p>We needed to wait for the poison to kill them all and settle down.</p><p><br></p><p>When we went down, it was already dark and the entire area was eerily quiet.</p><p><br></p><p>Did we hunt all the animals in the area?<br><br></p><p>Damn….</p><p><br></p><p>Herbalists were scary.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at my Level.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Squire: Level 15[1000/5500]</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Even her Militia Class had reached level 18.</p><p><br></p><p>Without a word, we collected all the bodies and left the area.</p><p><br></p><p> It wasn’t until we were out of the forest area that I let out a sigh of relief.</p><p><br></p><p>“That was fun. I haven’t had this much fun in a long time.” She was the one who broke the silence and I looked at her dumbfounded.</p><p><br></p><p>I won’t lie.</p><p><br></p><p>My heart was still beating fast.</p><p><br></p><p>I was excited too.</p><p><br></p><p>But my case was different.</p><p><br></p><p>What was wrong with her?</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at my expression and giggled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s get cleaned off. I am more afraid of ruining my hair than I am of those wolves, dear.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I….okay.”</p><p><br></p><p>We trekked towards the place with the pond.</p><p><br></p><p>I scanned the area for wild animals and found a few snakes and nothing else.</p><p><br></p><p>This area was still under the wolves and they hadn’t respawned yet so we had some time here.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, you can keep watch and guard me while I take a bath and I will do the same.” Surprisingly, the one to say this was not me.</p><p><br></p><p>Oh, she was gorgeous. There was no argument about that.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, she was probably the most stunning woman I had seen in both my lives.</p><p><br></p><p>That said….my instincts warned me not to look at her in the wrong way.</p><p><br></p><p>Especially when I remembered the fight with the wolves.</p><p><br></p><p>So, despite the alluring scene in front of me, I kept my sight on the area around us.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Venelana -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She walked into the clear water of the pond and splashed her face with some clean water to rinse off the mud.</p><p><br></p><p>This game was turning out to be more than she had expected.</p><p><br></p><p>It has been almost eighteen days since the Game started and there were no signs of this thing ending.</p><p><br></p><p>Even if what the so-called ‘Game Master’ said was true, it would still be around a day in the outside world which meant that her body would have been discovered by someone and her family informed.</p><p><br></p><p>Knowing her son and husband, they would have already called for the best magicians including Ajuka to take a look at her condition and they still hadn’t found a way to break it.</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, a soul contract, if what the Game Master said was true, would never be easy to break.</p><p><br></p><p>Even a week in the outside world would be five months in here so she was preparing to enjoy this while it lasted.</p><p><br></p><p>Staying at home had been getting boring and to be quite honest, she hadn’t had this much fun in a long time.</p><p><br></p><p>Despite the relatively peaceful behaviour nowadays, they were still a race which was made to combat against the forces of heaven and fallen angels.</p><p><br></p><p>Her current level of power reminded her of her childhood and while back then her training had been with the ongoing Great War in mind, this was like a more enjoyable game.</p><p><br></p><p>She could see this becoming a great hit had it not been for the whole….being trapped in the game debacle.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly she heard a swishing sound and quickly drew a dagger she had on her side only to see an arrow fly past her and hitting the ground and a hissing sound sounding from the place as a snake writhed in pain before falling dead.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at the rock on the bank of the pond and saw Arthas holding a bow and arrow and checking the surrounding area.</p><p><br></p><p>It had been a few days since she met this kid, Arthas and he reminded her a bit of Koneko, although much better than the poor girl.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, he had been a true gentleman to her every time she had met him unlike most of the other men whom she had seen in the village.</p><p><br></p><p>The thugs who had died that day had just been the worst among the bunch.</p><p><br></p><p>Conditions like these tend to bring out the worst in people and so, him, a young boy, the same age as her daughter, being able to keep himself in control and behave as he does, said a lot about his character and mental strength.</p><p><br></p><p>Thus, she chose to accompany him to the nearest town, to know more about him. As she had said, the game was only going to get harder and she too needed people to protect her back and a sweet boy like Arthas seemed like a good choice.</p><p><br></p><p>Her original plan was to find her daughter and her peerage and Grayfia and form a team with them but who knew how long that would take? And having another good team member like Arthas wouldn’t hurt.</p><p><br></p><p>And it looks like her choice was correct.</p><p><br></p><p>She had gained more levels in a few hours than she had done in the past eighteen days.</p><p><br></p><p>With a final splash of water, she rinsed her face and turned back, walking out of the pond.</p><p><br></p><p>She saw Arthas, turning the other way, giving her some privacy to change and giggled.</p><p><br></p><p>If she was stuck in this game for the next few months, then she was going to enjoy herself to her fullest.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><a href=\"https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><strong>Look who’s back.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Thank Jackle(on my discord) for this one.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>A lot of things happened in this chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Our boy got the first T3 Job and is making friends with Mama Gremory.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>In doing so, he unknowingly gained the attention of ‘The Game Master’, someone who has the whole Dxd world by the balls right now.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Rizevim tried to be evil in front of the Game Master and got his neck snapped while the entire Underworld was threatened by the Game Master, his family and their pet.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The Game Master doesn’t like interruptions in his game and now the whole world knows this.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Meanwhile, Arthas has finally left the beginner's village with a surprising companion.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>We will see the reaction of the whole world in the next chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Till then, have fun.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enjoy the next chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>",

Does anyone have any questions?\"</p><p><br></p><p>This is so boring.</p><p><br></p><p>I mechanically noted down the problem. My mind was in its own world though.</p><p><br></p><p>The teacher tried to make the lesson interesting but… much more than the first time but doing basic high school algebra again when I already have my masters… could only be so interesting.</p><p><br></p><p>Then again living life again was… <em>pretty boring</em>.</p><p><br></p><p>Normally the thoughts of what was called isekai, was very popular among the weebs of my time. I would know, I was one of them after all.</p><p><br></p><p>But the truth is often very underwhelming.</p><p><br></p><p>Living as a newborn child was a punishment on its own. Not being able to communicate is very and I mean <em>very</em> annoying.</p><p><br></p><p>And unlike what all those BS novels and fics showed, these days have a <em>very great</em> effect on a person's mind. Effects that would need a long ass therapy to recover from.</p><p><br></p><p>I for one became uninterested in common things that children of my age enjoy. It was annoying at first to have to pretend to care until I got tired of pretending and gave up trying.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean just how much can someone pretend to be happy to be taken out to the park or play with three year olds.</p><p><br></p><p>Being an oddball is not appreciated in society however. A sociopath, even less.</p><p><br></p><p>I'm not a sociopath however. I just have my emotions a bit dulled. I still feel happy and sad. I still enjoy things, but not as much as I did before.</p><p><br></p><p>I guess I need more stimulation, preferably something to get my adrenaline pumping.</p><p><br></p><p>This class however is not that.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Can you please give the answer to this question, Mr. Strauss?\" I heard the teacher. </p><p><br></p><p>\"20.\" I replied, taking one look at the board.</p><p><br></p><p>The teacher gave a sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>This teacher was new. Others had already given up asking me questions.</p><p><br></p><p>The only reason I’m not thrown out of the class is because of my grades. I have the top scores in every subject the school teaches. Not because I'm a genius or anything but simply because these are childish things.</p><p><br></p><p>I’m able to learn things faster than most but that could be because of my experience.</p><p><br></p><p>Now some may question that if I'm this advanced and bored, why don't I seek for early promotions. The answer would be simple.</p><p><br></p><p>My parents.</p><p><br></p><p>They think it is better for me to learn to get along with kids my age.</p><p><br></p><p>I cannot explain my situation to them and I know that they genuinely care so I too bite the bullet and go on with it.</p><p><br></p><p>The class ended. The last class for today.</p><p><br></p><p>I walked towards my home.</p><p><br></p><p>My parents have a flourishing business of their own. It keeps them busy but they never skipped any of their duties due to this. In fact they have been the best parents I could ask for.</p><p><br></p><p>Well except the school part.</p><p><br></p><p>It was just this. A boring routine everyday.</p><p><br></p><p>This however was going to change soon.</p><p><br></p><p>I opened my room's door and saw the solution to my difficulties.</p><p><br></p><p>The Nerve Gear.</p><p><br></p><p>Now the first thing that comes to mind when saying the words Nerve Gear to a reincarnated person like me is - Sword Art Online, a series I only watched so that I could watch the abridged version.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole debacle of getting trapped in the game was a big red sign but I did all the research about the game and the nerve gear. Apparently the security and safety details were taken as the first priority(as it should be). So no brain frying attachments, the device can just be detached and once the power is turned out, the player wakes up simply.</p><p><br></p><p>Anything that went over someone's head was thoroughly checked. Even a simple helmet had to go through several checks, let alone something like this Nerve Gear.</p><p><br></p><p>Also, the maker of this was not Akihiko Kayaba. How that guy had pulled something like that went to say a lot about both him and the government of the country.</p><p><br></p><p>Oh, by the way, the name of the Game is 'Soul Art Online'.</p><p><br></p><p>The game has a fantasy land where the total land area to be explored is forty times more than the entire earth. They went all out on the game. A total of thirty five million Nerve Gears were sold all over the world for the 'Grand Opening' of the game.</p><p><br></p><p>The game itself was said to have a function which allowed the players to communicate without a language barrier. It did something with the brainwaves to convert the language perfectly and people could talk in any language and the listeners will perceive it in their own language. As for the contents of the game, it's all a surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>The Beta Testers were all insiders and none of them revealed anything outside.The rumours came up a few times but they were removed swiftly. </p><p><br></p><p>It is estimated that the game will have around twenty million players for its grand opening. An event will be held at the opening and that was about everything we knew.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Scene Change -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I set the Nerve Gear up near my bed. The equipment was quite easy to set up.</p><p><br></p><p>My parents had actually been happy that I was actually <em>excited</em> about something and didn't mind the Nerve Gear either.</p><p><br></p><p>It was quarter to eight and the game opened at eight am sharp but the players could take some time for their character creation. Fifteen minutes should be enough for that I guess.</p><p><br></p><p>I switched the Nerve Gear on and blackness surrounded me.</p><p><br></p><p>I opened my eyes in a white space.</p><p><br></p><p>A window appeared in front of me asking to enter the name of my character.</p><p><br></p><p>My full name is Arthur Strauss. I thought of a name that made me chuckle a bit.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Arthas.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Arth</strong>ur Str<strong>a</strong>us<strong>s</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>Then came the character design. And they did go all out on this one.</p><p><br></p><p>The sheer range of character designs available in the game was amazing.</p><p><br></p><p>There was even an option for changing the gender, although it was permanent so I stayed away from it.</p><p><br></p><p>I chose a character of my size. I didn’t know how the motor functions would be affected by the change in body size. Rather not take any risks.</p><p><br></p><p>As for the looks, I myself looked pretty fine. I inherited the good looks of my parents. The blue hair from my mother and the golden eyes of my father. This was the only fact that told me that we were in a different world until I was old enough to know more about the outside world. The hair colours of people in the world are straight out of anime.</p><p><br></p><p>The Game was advertised to have over eight hundred classes but they would need to be unlocked. It reminded me somewhat of the Final Fantasy Games I had played in my previous life. The first job class was the same for everyone, A Villager.</p><p><br></p><p>We can unlock other classes as we progress in the game.</p><p><br></p><p>Then finally when it was the time to start the game. The countdown reached zero and a message appeared in front me.</p><p><br></p><p>A man in black hooded cloak spoke the words in an ancient sounding tone.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Welcome to the world of Arcana. Here the wildest of your dreams will come true. You will face your wildest imaginations and if you prevail, achieve the greatest of rewards.</strong></p><p><strong>This world will challenge the furthest extent of your whole being. Adapt and grow stronger. After all, ‘Human beings are strong because we can change ourselves.’</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Do you wish to put yourself on the line - mind, body, heart and soul to explore the ends of this world?</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>[Yes][No]</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I clicked yes and the world around me flashed, sending me to my starting point.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Scene Change -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The Redwick Village is the starting point that I was sent to.</p><p><br></p><p>The game has over 50,000 starting villages for the players. The location is chosen at random. The player can level up to a certain level and teleport to any of the locations after completing certain quests.</p><p><br></p><p>It was not quite user friendly, especially for those who wanted to form guilds with the members of their previous games and family members but it did teach people to become self-reliant. The game developers said that it was to stop the initial bullying phase or at least delay it a bit. Some guilds can capture certain starting points and become a nuisance for the players at the start of the game, monopolising the resources. This will prevent that from happening at the very start of the game.</p><p><br></p><p>Well, that’s what they said. There were short term rumours that the creator of the game was crazy. I mean sure, I believe that. Geniuses are crazy and it will take something far more than a normal genius to make this game. I mean look at this beauty.</p><p><br></p><p>The first thing I did after entering the Game was check if the Game had a Logout button.</p><p><br></p><p>It did.</p><p><br></p><p>I made a trip from my room to make sure as well.</p><p><br></p><p>This was thankfully not like Sword Art Online.</p><p><br></p><p>I could smell the fragrance of the fresh countryside air.</p><p><br></p><p>The Sky looked amazing and we could see different masses of land floating in extremely distant skies.</p><p><br></p><p>The touch and feel of everything was as original as it could be. It was fucking perfect.</p><p><br></p><p>The game’s event was going to start when the total participants reached 20 million. Until then we were free to do as we liked.</p><p><br></p><p>The Class System was basically, all Classes were divided into Tiers.</p><p><br></p><p>The Villager was a Tier 1 class.</p><p><br></p><p>It had 10 levels.</p><p><br></p><p>The Max Level of each Class was equal to 10*(It’s Tier).</p><p><br></p><p>For example a Tier Eight Class would have a max level of 80.</p><p><br></p><p>The Class Window was divided into ten slots, one corresponding for each Tier. The Player can Unlock any Class but they can only keep one Class active in each Tier and they will get the Stats and Skills corresponding to the active Classes. The Equipment will correspond to the Class in the Highest Active Tier active to the player.</p><p><br></p><p>This allowed the players to play and explore each class in the Game if they could unlock them and were willing to level them, that is, as well as enjoy completely different playstyles if they were willing to work for it. The Game Developers had worked a lot and it showed. </p><p><br></p><p>I saw that some players had started appearing around me and I stepped into the village to get the quests and probably get some way to unlock stuff.</p><p><br></p><p>Early game progress is very important.</p><p><br></p><p>I noticed a shop sign on the street and entered the shop that looked like a general store.</p><p><br></p><p>It was manned by an old woman, dressed in a mediaeval European villager dress.</p><p><br></p><p>“Welcome to Martha’s Store, child. What do you want today? A piece of bread, mabe some ointment or a new set of shirts?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hello. My name is Arthas. I'm new to this place and was wondering if there was a place where I could find some new work. I do need some money to pay for things?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh dear me. A newbie in the Village. Well, welcome to Redwick, Laddie. Work you say? Hmm, let me see. I wouldn’t mind getting some blue moon grass from the nearby grasslands. It grows just outside the village although they are a bit hard to spot. This is what it looks like. I would like to have twenty of these but I can take more if you get them.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Quest received:</strong></p><p><strong>Martha’s List.</strong></p><p><strong>Martha needs the Blue Moon Grass to make her healing salves. Find her enough to complete her requirements.</strong></p><p><strong>Objective: Blue Moon Grass(0/20)</strong></p><p><strong>Reward: 100 Exp. +5 Exp for each extra piece you collect, 1G for each piece of Blue Moon Grass.</strong></p><p><strong>Accept: Yes/No,</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She showed me the picture of the herb and I got the message that the quest has been received.</p><p><br></p><p>I look in my inventory. I have one hundred gold.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are there any dangers in the area? If so, where can I find a weapon?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No no. There aren’t any dangers in the area. The dangerous things only come out at night if you go near the forest. At best some rabbits and such. As for the weapon part, you can look at the Blacksmith shop two alleys down the street. Braham makes very good weapons. Was a Knight once, that old man. Too bad he encountered a dire wolf. Survived with just a leg, that one.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thanks granny. I will get those Blue Moon Grasses for you but before leaving can I see some of your wares?”</p><p><br></p><p>I left the shop with some bread, ropes and an ointment and quickly hurried to the blacksmith’s shop.</p><p><br></p><p>The man himself wasn’t present at the counter and a younger assistant was present who looked like he would faint at any instant. After some talk, I found out that the guy had been working hard to save something for his sister’s birthday present. I bought a Knife from him for 20 gold and two basic traps for another twenty and left towards my first quest.</p><p>He did give me a quest to find something for his sister if I could.</p><p><br></p><p>The village was starting to get crowded as new players were popping in every instant.</p><p><br></p><p>I raced towards the corner of the village. The basic Health and Stamina Bars showing on the top left corner of my screen. A Villager was the lowest of the job classes and thus the stamina on this Class is shit.</p><p><br></p><p>I reached the outskirts of the town pretty quickly. It was a rather open field with some trees and bushes here and there.</p><p><br></p><p>I even saw a rabbit or two around the bushes. The bushes themselves had several berries and such. I don’t know the respawn time on these things so it will be better to get my hands on as many resources as I can.</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly set up the traps near the area I had seen the rabbits appearing and got down to picking up every fruit I could get my hands on.</p><p><br></p><p>The Blue Moon Grass that Martha said to look for were rare and hard to find but there was one thing in common among them and that was that each of them was in the shade of other plants or rocks.</p><p><br></p><p>In about another hour, the other players started coming out to this area but by that time, I had emptied the bushes and netted several rabbits. There were plenty of rabbit holes near the area.</p><p><br></p><p>I wonder what their respawn times were.</p><p><br></p><p>I had however collected more than twice the amount of the grass needed for Quest along with several other herbs that I didn’t know anything about. It was in front of me so I picked them.</p><p><br></p><p>The logged in players were also starting to reach the required mark.</p><p><br></p><p>I went to the old shopkeeper lady and completed the quest, getting 1G for each piece of Blue Moon grass for a total of forty, recovering the amount I had spent. The fruits were bought by her too. I completed the quest from the quest menu to receive the rewards.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>+200 Exp, +40 G.</strong></p><p><strong>Level Up!</strong></p><p><strong>Villager Lvl: 2(100/200)</strong></p><p><strong>+1 STR, +1 END, +1 DEX.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>T1 Class: Forager Unlocked.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>On her recommendation, I went ahead to the Butcher’s shop who could buy the rabbit's meat while the blacksmith or the tailor could make stuff with the rabbit pelt.</p><p><br></p><p>I sold half the meat while keeping half for myself.</p><p><br></p><p>It was at this time, the counter reached the 20 million mark.</p><p><br></p><p>The Sky turned black and on the screen, the same man who had appeared in the welcome menu appeared in the sky.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Welcome everyone to ‘Soul Art Online’. I'm the creator of this game. You all can call me the Game Master.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong> With our introductions done, let's start with the main part of Soul Art Online's Story.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>This world of Arcana will be your home for years to come. I dare say that, except for the extra Game parts, it is a real world of its own.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I have given everyone the same starting point, the same potential and the same opportunities to rise to the top of the world. You can be anything, an Angel or a Devil, a Hero or a Villain in this world, however, be sure to face the consequences of your actions. I might not punish you, but the world itself is not so forgiving.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Every action has a consequence. Some might be good, some bad.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Okay then, have fun till you complete the game.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Oh yeah, I completely forgot to tell you all with mysterious philosophical BS, you guys are stuck in the game till you complete this. If you die in the game, you die in real life.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Remember that part about the souls and all in the welcome screen? That was all real.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>You all quite literally signed off your souls to me.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>As for the other facts, those are surprises you all can discover for yourselves.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The words were treated like a joke by the people surrounding me but I felt a pit forming in my stomach.</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly checked the menu and sure enough, the Log out Button was gone.</p><p><br></p><p>There was still hope in my mind because the device can just be turned off and it will be switched off after the battery runs out. This could be an elaborate prank as well.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Oh, in case you are thinking about anyone breaking you out after the battery runs out, don't bother. The device doesn't run on electricity but magic. For those who don't know, magic exists, so do all the mythological creatures that you may have heard about. It started the moment we started this event in-game. The time inside this world flows twenty times faster than the outside so a year outside is twenty years inside this world. Complete the game quickly and you might be back for Christmas. Good Luck. Have fun.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Oh, I left a gift for you all for this event. He snapped his fingers.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I felt my body change slightly. Looking at the window pane, I discovered that the slight changes I had made to my character's looks were reversed. I looked just like myself.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked as the sky turned back to its original colour as the Game Master's image faded.</p><p><br></p><p>This was very similar to what hazy bits of memories I had from the previous life. Things are going to turn chaotic very soon. Did I feel a panic attack coming?</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe. For once I felt thankful to my dulled emotions.</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly rushed towards an Inn and booked a room to get myself some privacy. I’d rather not be around when people started panicking. It is like a flu that spreads from one person to another.</p><p><br></p><p>I occupied the bed and took deep breaths. To calm myself down. It was for the first time in years that I felt my heart beat that fast outside of exercises. On one hand I was worried about being stuck in here for who knows how long and on the other, a very small part of me was really wishing for that to be the case.</p><p><br></p><p>I tried to meditate for a few minutes, to calm myself and think properly. Losing the ability to think properly would be a sure shot way to die.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean sure there is a high chance that this might be a prank but I don’t think that anyone and I mean anyone would do such a thing on the first day of a worldwide game launch. This type of move was basically PR suicide for any company.</p><p><br></p><p>This means that people will go crazy after they recover from their initial panic. Such fear will make them take irrational decisions and be prone to violence.</p><p><br></p><p>First things first, get a headstart from the first village. Games can have first kill bonuses and stuff for people who kill a boss for the first time and so.</p><p><br></p><p>I made a short term plan to take advantage of things I can while others are dealing with the situation while trying to remember all the things the Game Master had said.</p><p><br></p><p>This world is as real as the real world.</p><p><br></p><p>So stop thinking of this as a Game and start viewing this as a real world where people have a special type of power.</p><p><br></p><p>I brought out a piece of paper and made some notes of the things that I remembered to check out for in the next hour.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Scene Change -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>A week has passed since the opening of this game. I'm not sure if I should even call this a game anymore.</p><p><br></p><p>Any and all hopes of this being shut down were starting to die down.</p><p><br></p><p>And the most ridiculous thing about this was that I was not really bothered by any of this. I mean a bit but considering people who had shut themselves inside the inn or their makeshift homes, I might as well be enjoying my life here. The panic phase had started differently for everyone. Fifteen minutes after the announcement, some people had started to become uneasy. An hour later they had started panicking and shouting profanities. Around two hours later, Things had started to become crazy as people had started attacking the npc’s while some others huddled and started crying.</p><p><br></p><p>I had taken that time to collect all the quests I could at a single time and left to the outskirts of the village to complete them.</p><p><br></p><p>I needed a T2 Class job to get ahead and a T3 to stay safe. This was however easier said than done.</p><p><br></p><p>The rabbit pelts were used to make a scarf which was offered to the Blacksmith’s apprentice, getting me a thanks from him and a recommendation to the Hunter of the village because I could hunt well apparently.</p><p><br></p><p>The Hunter was the boy’s uncle.</p><p><br></p><p>I also got to meet the Blacksmith who gave me several quests which were basically to mine for ores, collect the fangs of the Sharp Fanged Wolves, the tusks of the Black Nosed Boars and such.</p><p><br></p><p>These quests were however currently outside my range because any one of those animals could make a chow out of me.</p><p><br></p><p>I paid a visit to the village Hunter who was another old man, Gunter.</p><p><br></p><p>The letter gave me the chance to become an apprentice hunter. My first test to become an Apprentice Hunter was to hunt 20 Rabbits and a boar.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, the first part was easy.</p><p><br></p><p>It just needed time.</p><p><br></p><p>The second one was hard. I had gained two levels after the Blacksmith’s quest and another one of Martha’s quests but a level 4 Villager alone would still die if facing a boar.</p><p><br></p><p>The trap to hunt a boar was expensive and by expensive I mean really expensive.</p><p><br></p><p>I had gotten a few tools from the Blacksmith. An axe, a shovel, a pickaxe for mining as well as several pieces of rope.</p><p><br></p><p>It took me hours to dig a hole and disguise it somewhat. Some chilli powder was collected from the General Stores and made into makeshift bombs after mixing it with water.</p><p><br></p><p>The next part was waiting on a tree for the boar. I spotted one after an hour or so and threw stones at it, bringing it towards me and then I threw the chilli water on its eyes. The beast cried out in pain as it thrashed around finally dropping into the hole.</p><p><br></p><p>I attacked it with the pickaxe, putting a hole through its head.</p><p><br></p><p>The Kill netted me one hundred and twenty experience points pushing me near level 5.</p><p><br></p><p>The old hunter took the quest loot and made me his formal apprentice and gave me a badge which signified the title.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Apprentice Hunter’s Insignia</strong></p><p><strong>+1 STR, +1 DEX</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I got the notification at the same moment.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>T2 Class: Apprentice Hunter Unlocked.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>By then the people had gone full on mad and started attacking the villagers. The Villagers were much stronger and everyone who did such a thing was put in the Village Chief’s prison.</p><p><br></p><p>Almost half of the players were thrown in prison.</p><p><br></p><p>Their sentence will be for the next two weeks. This had instantly calmed down the rest of the players who retreated into whatever holes they could find for themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>I on the other hand went ahead and started my training with Gunter. It was basically him teaching me three new skills.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Track</strong>, <strong>Set Trap</strong> and <strong>Skinning</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>All he did was send me out to hunt boars after that. Thankfully the new skills were very efficient in taking down those things and I filled the outskirts of the entire forest with the traps.</p><p><br></p><p>In the next two days I maxed up my Villager Class which finally gave me the option to change into the Apprentice Hunter Class.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Congratulations on being the first one from your Village to advance to a 2nd Tier Class.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Title Gained</strong></p><p><strong>One Among a Hundred</strong></p><p><strong>+10% increased Exp Gain.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Keep doing your best, Player.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The Game had such things?</p><p><br></p><p>This changed everything completely.</p><p><br></p><p>50,000 Villages meant that at least 50,000 players will get this title. What’s next?</p><p><br></p><p>First in a town, first in a prefecture, first in a country?</p><p><br></p><p>Hunting Boars was not giving as much experience any more. In fact the Exp Gain was halved after I changed to a T2 Class, a single boar started giving me 60 Exp.</p><p><br></p><p>The <strong>Apprentice Hunter</strong> Class gave <strong>+2 STR, +2 END and +3 DEX</strong> Per Level.</p><p><br></p><p>The Class itself gave the user a Basic Weapons Skills.</p><p><br></p><p>I took the opportunity to skin all the boars and sell the meat to the Village Butcher while the Skin was used to make a new set of armour for myself.</p><p><br></p><p>The money was used to procure enough materials for the long hunt that I was planning to go on. I bought everything that I thought was important. Books on the local flora and fauna, basics of weapon maintenance and two sets of swords, spears and a Bow with two quivers of arrows. Water pouches and food that can be stored for long journeys and plenty of medicine, both some basic antidotes and healing salves and a pair of goggles to protect my eyes. Martha gave me some more collection quests as I was now an Apprentice Hunter.</p><p><br></p><p>In about a day or two, the ones who are in depression will have to force themselves to move and crowd the usual hunting ground where I hunt. I wasn’t planning to hang around there anyway but it still would be inconvenient for levelling up.</p><p><br></p><p>I plan to pick up the pace and level up till I max this Class.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Scene Change -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Two weeks had passed. By now all of the prisoners had been released. The rest of the people had accepted that they were trapped in this world more or less. I wonder if they realise that not even a day has passed on the outside world if what the Game Master told us was true? Although from what I could gauge out, no one was believing that part maybe because of their anger?</p><p><br></p><p>I had rampaged inside the forest this past week. The animals inside were all T2 with the occasional rare T3 mixed in which would have been extremely dangerous if I had been hunting the normal way.</p><p><br></p><p>Creating a suitable location for the hunt took a majority of my first day but after it was done, it was a slaughter. The wolves had a very sharp sense of hearing and smell and cooperated really well in small teams. But once that was taken out, it was like shooting fish in a barrel. It wasn’t as if I was always having an easy time. The T3 Bear that had come out of nowhere had almost uprooted the tree which I was hiding on. It was only thanks to the chilli bomb to its face that it left the tree and I could find an opportunity to make a shot.</p><p><br></p><p>It took a dozen arrows to take down that thing but it was worth it. 500 Exp and a ton of loot including a rare one.</p><p><br></p><p>I was finally able to max out the<strong> Apprentice Hunter</strong> Class.</p><p><br></p><p>I had gathered a buttload of stuff in the last week that needed to be sold and things that I needed to restock and buy.</p><p><br></p><p>The Apprentice Hunter Class gave some very useful skills.<strong> Keen eyes, Aim Leg, Disable</strong>, etc.</p><p><br></p><p>I could see the players moving around although in a mechanical way to do the basic job to feed themselves. My previous hunting ground was now full of people with a few dozen trying to hunt a rabbit when it came out. A simple <strong>Observe</strong> showed that they were all Villagers. In fact the highest level I had seen among the players was a level 6 Villager who was leading a party to hunt boars.</p><p><br></p><p>I did draw some eyes towards myself because I was coming out of the forest but no one tried to pick any fights with me.</p><p><br></p><p>The Game had a pretty nifty feature. You can hide your level and Class from other players but some players with special skills can see through it. My Apprentice Hunter Class did give me such a skill. After all, which decent hunter wouldn’t have a skill to assess their opponent?</p><p><br></p><p>I went straight towards Gunter’s Hut to see what needed to be done to get the Hunter Class. He was a Hunter so it was only natural that he would know what I needed to do to become one.</p><p><br></p><p>There were a couple of people talking to the man outside.</p><p><br></p><p>I remembered the quest to become an Apprentice. 20 Rabbits and a Boar. With the increased number of people, it would take a lot of time to complete that quest.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t say anything but waited for them to disperse and then went to the man.</p><p><br></p><p>“Arthas. Is that you brat? You disappeared for a while. I thought that the forest claimed you too but thank the Spirits that you’re still fine.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I went on a hunting trip.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And it was successful from what I can see. You’ve grown up a lot.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you teacher. I wanted to know what I needed to do to become a Hunter. Is there another test that I need to take perhaps?” I asked as the man laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Already wanting to become a Hunter, eh? It’s not that easy to become one, ya know. Took me a year. You think you are ready for that? You need to hunt an Iron Back Bear. You can’t receive any help from others. The Badge you have will record it and only then can you qualify for the exam.”</p><p><br></p><p>I gave the man my badge and he raised an eyebrow before letting out a gasp.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sunova….you brat! How did you get that one?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Got lucky. Anyways, I can take the Hunter’s Exam now, right?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well yeah. I can hardly imagine any reason you couldn’t. To get a Hunter’s Badge, you need to hunt a Mutated Animal in the forest. They are far stronger than the normal ones and can also use Magic sometimes. Be careful. Those things are the lords of the forest around this area. They will not be easy to hunt.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Quest Received</strong></p><p><strong>Hunt or be Hunted.</strong></p><p><strong>Objective: Hunt a mutated animal in the forest.</strong></p><p><strong>Reward: Hunter’s Badge, T3 Class: Hunter Unlocked.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Mutated animals.</p><p><br></p><p>“What are these mutated animals?” I asked, trying to get a general idea.</p><p><br></p><p>“They are animals that have somehow evolved into something of a variation of their species. It can be for various reasons. Maybe they ate something that gave them power, maybe they were blessed by a spirit, maybe it just became strong enough or maybe it was cursed by someone. The main point is, they become far stronger than the normal ones of their kind. They are generally the lord of the areas they live in. Very hard to kill. They do however drop the best of drops and sometimes even magic cores that can be used to imbue items with elemental powers.  Those things sell for a pretty decent amount of gold I tell ya.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are there any mutated animals in the forest?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“There sure are. Hunted one myself to pass the exam in my youth.” he said, his eyes gaining a reminiscing look.</p><p><br></p><p>“Really! Where? Which area can I find them in? I haven’t spotted a mutated animal even after an entire week inside the forest.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That would be me helping ya, kid. Sorry but, no can do.”</p><p><br></p><p>I let out a sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>Obviously it won’t be so easy.</p><p><br></p><p>I will ask around a bit and see if I can find anything.</p><p><br></p><p>It will be a difficult prey to hunt.</p><p><br></p><p>If I don’t find anything, I will head out towards the next village.</p><p><br></p><p>With these thoughts in mind, I headed towards the Butcher's Shop to sell off the meat that I had gathered in this week.</p><p><br></p><p>The wolf Pelts and the rest of the parts will go to the Blacksmith’s Shop.</p><p><br></p><p>The Blacksmith’s shop was empty. Considering the price of things here and the fact that even hunting a rabbit was a challenge with the number of players crowding the hunting ground, it wasn’t a surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mr. Arthas, you’re back. I thought you had left for the next village.” the assistant asked me as I entered the shop.</p><p><br></p><p>“I was just out for a long hunt. I need to complete some tasks and commision some new armour. I’ll provide the materials, you can add anything if you need on top of that. Think you can do that?”</p><p><br></p><p>“New armour? I’ll need to see the materials.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure.” I brought out the materials I had collected over the week.</p><p><br></p><p>Scores of animal pelts, claws, fangs, even large bones were lined up in front of the now stunned guy.</p><p><br></p><p>“I want four sets of armour, the best you can make out of them. Four Swords, four quivers of arrows, four long spears and two bows. The rest I would like to submit for the quests I had gotten from Mr. Braham.”</p><p><br></p><p>My quests were of a repeatable nature and I could complete them multiple times with the amount of items I had with me.</p><p>He selected the best of the items he could and returned the rest to me.</p><p><br></p><p>The best thing about the game was that I could keep the quest completed but receive the rewards when I wanted. This meant I could keep completed quests and keep the stored exp in them and just max out a Class the moment I gain them, provided I had enough exp in the quests.</p><p><br></p><p>The armour and weapons would take a day to make. I did get some information about the mutated animals. There were eight of them all around the forest. Each had an area of their own. Some even had subordinates, like the Mutated Wolf was the leader of its own pack, so it was out. The bear was alone but it was stronger than the first two.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a snake but I didn’t want anything to do with it. I was not going to try and see if the basic antidote worked on its poison or not. The tiger was out as well.</p><p><br></p><p>That left the Bison, Gorilla, Boar and Jaguar.</p><p><br></p><p>Gorillas can climb trees and so can Jaguars.</p><p><br></p><p>So finally between the Boar and the Bison.</p><p><br></p><p>Need to find more information.</p><p><br></p><p>I headed towards Martha’s shop to complete the last bits of the collection quests.</p><p><br></p><p>This shop was more crowded than others. It is probably because this place also sold bread and the basic necessities of the people. Currently the cheapest way to survive in the place. A piece of bread was 1G each. This could keep them filled up for a day. I waited for my turn which came soon.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is that you, Arthas?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, Granny. I came here with the quests you had given me and to restock on some items.”</p><p><br></p><p>I realised that some people were looking at me but I had better things to do. At this point time was of essence and I was not gonna waste my time.</p><p><br></p><p>I laid out the products and completed the collection quests and quickly restocked on the items before taking some more quests and leaving.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Scene Change -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Asking around the entire village, earned me some more quests and some information. The Bison was a part of a herd while the Boar was alone. That last bit of information decided what I was going to hunt next.</p><p><br></p><p>I still had to wait for a day to get the weapons and armour though.</p><p><br></p><p>I had noticed some people trying to keep a watch on me since I completed the quests at Martha’s. Around three people were taking turns to run into me inside every shop I tried going or speaking to every person I was speaking to. If they thought they were doing a good job of hiding, they were dead wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>I still didn’t feel safe staying inside the village so I left towards the outskirts.</p><p><br></p><p>And so here I was, in a small hole like cave near the outskirts of the village. At times like this, people are more dangerous than any bosses or wild animals I might encounter.</p><p><br></p><p>My train of thought was broken by the sounds of a fight nearby. The sound seemed to be from a boar.</p><p><br></p><p>I snuck around quietly and saw the scene. A woman who looked to be in her twenties was on a large rock, throwing pouches at a group of young piglets. She had light brown hair and purple or violet eyes, the night light was making it difficult to see properly. The piglets were getting a ‘Dizzy’ status so it must have been something in those pouches. Too bad she attracted the boar too and the big guy was just shrugging it off. She was stuck on the top of the rock although she did manage to make some hits on the group with her spear before it broke leaving her stranded on the top of the rock.</p><p><br></p><p>I waited to see what she did or if someone would arrive near the place or if it was a trap but even after waiting for fifteen minutes straight there were no signs of anyone showing up.</p><p><br></p><p>I slowly crawled out of my place and took up a position on a nearby rock. The angle was good so I took my aim and the first shot was made towards the Boar, Aim Leg.</p><p><br></p><p>The arrow tip gained a green colour as the arrow tore through the air striking the leg of the boar. It was a normal level 7 Boar. Not much it could have done against me.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl looked in the direction of the arrow and saw me but by then I had taken another shot directly taking the head of the piglet that was Level 5.</p><p><br></p><p>I noticed a pattern. At level 6, the Piglets evolved into a Level 1 Boar. So it was probably on the verge of evolution. I’d rather it get taken down now.</p><p><br></p><p>The Boar looked in my direction but the leg injury made it nigh impossible for it to do anything. Just for a safety measure, I took down another Piglet before climbing down and bringing out a sword.</p><p><br></p><p>The Boar tried to charge but fell down. I threw a spare piece of spear near the girl. “Take a kill.”</p><p><br></p><p>This boar would have given me only 30 Exp which was a waste compared to the 120 it would give the girl.</p><p><br></p><p>The piglets were easy for me to take down.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl stared for a moment before taking the spear and piercing the eye of the Boar in a straight strike.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s when I noticed the level of the girl, Level 9 Villager.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s the highest level apart from me in this Village.</p><p><br></p><p>The leftover piglets were soon taken care of by the two of us.</p><p><br></p><p>I took the ones I killed leaving the rest to her and she in turn returned the spear to me when she was done.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you for saving my life.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I didn’t save your life. At best you would have been stuck there till morning and at worst for a whole day. They would have left to hunt or other Players would have found you either way.”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked stunned for a second while I started to skin the piglets before letting out a giggle.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, that does sound right. In that case, allow me to thank you for helping me out.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You’re welcome.”</p><p><br></p><p>I checked her name.</p><p><br></p><p>Veena.</p><p><br></p><p>“Can I ask what those things that you were throwing at the Piglets were?” That’s the main reason why I intervened even though she wasn’t in any real danger.</p><p><br></p><p>“Those were some herbal mixtures. I can mix some herbs to create mixtures with some effects. They are not very strong but enough to distract the animals, making it easier for me to take a strike. I mainly sell the mixtures and some healing salves to others.” she replied as she started walking away towards the village.</p><p><br></p><p>My sleep was ruined either way and it looked like it was going to be morning in an hour.</p><p><br></p><p>“But still hunting this late at night?” I asked her, curious.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mornings are when I work for Madam Martha as her Gardener and it is not really suitable for levelling up. People are getting restless nowadays and with the violent ones released, people are a bit tense in the mornings. Stealing kills and then fighting is common in the mornings. Nights are still the time when they don’t come outside, fearing for their lives. I simply take advantage of this.”</p><p><br></p><p>As odd as it sounded, it was also weirdly reasonable.</p><p><br></p><p>We walked together and I asked her about the Skill to mix herbs. It was apparently a Gardner Skill. The Gardener Class gave her Exp for the plants she grew but those were only applicable for when she had that class active. She was apparently a Level 5 Gardner. The T2 for that one will be an Apprentice Herbalist and T3 a Herbalist. This here was a straight out production Class Gamer. It’s always good to be friends with such people. After all, potions were more or less the staple of all Gamers.</p><p><br></p><p>We could see the gates of the village ahead of us.</p><p><br></p><p>It was then that it happened.</p><p><br></p><p>Some people came out from behind the rocks near the Village’s entrance. Around ten of them. I recognized three of them being the ones who were following me during the day.</p><p><br></p><p>I was wearing a cloak and my armour was covered under my normal shirt and cloak. I had opened my inventory and had the sword on my fingertips.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hello there. I'm Harmund. You need to pay the toll to enter the village.” The highest level among the group came forward. He was level 9 while the rest were all level 5 and above.</p><p><br></p><p>Really? Save a girl and get surrounded by a group of thugs.</p><p><br></p><p>Could it get any more cliché?</p><p><br></p><p>I narrowed my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t look so upset. It’s an initiative we have taken to collect money to help the players who have difficulty in surviving. We can take anything, Gold, Weapons, food anything. Anything you can donate. The more the better.” He continued with a patronising smile.</p><p><br></p><p>“And why haven’t I heard of such a thing? I'm pretty sure if people were doing such a thing, we surely would have known about it.” My new acquaintance questioned.</p><p><br></p><p>“We have just started this today. It still hasn’t spread yet.” He replied unbothered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sorry, I don’t have anything to contribute.” I tried to step around them but they blocked the road.</p><p><br></p><p>“Now, now, don’t be in such a hurry. We are just doing this for the good of the players in need. Surely you can contribute something.” He grabbed my shoulder.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have nothing to contribute. If you are so keen on helping them, do it yourself.” I shrugged his hands off.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are being very selfish now, Mister.” The others surrounding us brought out their weapons.</p><p><br></p><p>“If you want to help the people, call for everyone in the Village and announce such things. We cannot trust just anyone to carry out such things. Everyone needs to decide it first.” Veena tried to mediate.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you calling us liars, lady? Can’t you see the ten of us? Don’t we look like players in need?” A gruff looking man, level 8, I noticed walked up to her, trying to intimidate her. I noticed that she didn’t even blink an eye. Instead, I saw her eyes harden a bit.</p><p><br></p><p>I let out a sigh. “Why don’t you all drop the act already? I haven’t slept properly and am very annoyed. I could use some stress relief.”</p><p><br></p><p>There is a level difference of twenty one between me and their highest level. My stats should be around 4 times more than their strongest member.</p><p><br></p><p>“So be it then.” He brought out his sword and pointed it directly towards me. “Bring out the quest rewards you got from completing some high level quests for the old shopkeeper. No use lying. And since you‘re being such an uncooperative brat, bring out your gold and equipment too.” he poked the sword towards me.</p><p><br></p><p>“And the girl can pay for herself. I think I know what I want from her.” the gruff one grinned looking at her.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at her and her eyes were cold. It was a bit frightening how cold her eyes were. She looked at me and her eyes moved and it was as if a signal between the two of us.</p><p><br></p><p>The next second, I brought out my sword from my inventory and slashed the man who was holding me at sword point, taking off his arm. Before anything could happen, I threw chilli bombs towards the suddenly frozen group while my sword arm moved, thrusting the sword through the man’s head.</p><p><br></p><p>From the corner of my eyes I saw the actions of the sole female in the scene. She grabbed the hand of the man who was going to touch her face, twist it around and, bringing out a dagger from her inventory, repeatedly stabbed the man in the eyes and skull. The man might only have been one level short of her but that was a genuine martial arts move and the guy barely got any time to react. His face was already covered with the same powder she had thrown on the piglets.</p><p><br></p><p>I rushed towards the non affected people on my side and slashed them through. The adrenaline was probably working for me if that was even a thing inside the game.</p><p><br></p><p>She picked up the spear of her first victim and dashed towards the two on her side who defended themselves rather clumsily.</p><p><br></p><p>The entire group of ten assaulters were taken care of in less than two minutes. I took down seven of them and she killed the remaining three.</p><p><br></p><p>Their shouts were snuffed out in moments so I didn't see anyone coming out to check on them.</p><p><br></p><p>The dead bodies however didn't disappear immediately and after I had killed everyone, I faced the reality of the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>Dulled emotions or not, when the adrenaline faded away, I collapsed onto my knees as the realisation dawned on me. My breaths were becoming shorter and I had the urge to throw up when I recalled the feeling of slashing through them with my sword.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Venelana Gremory -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She watched as the boy tried to catch his breath and sighed to herself. He looked barely eighteen and a normal boy except for his slightly dulled emotions.</p><p><br></p><p>A devil, even a normal one is more attuned to sins and wouldn't have such a reaction, but a human would.</p><p><br></p><p>On top of that, he seems to <em>believe</em> that he is actually taking the lives of the people just now.</p><p><br></p><p>This 'game' was turning out to be more than she had expected.</p><p><br></p><p>When her daughter had been excited about the game and even her son had called it a marvel of science, she had been attracted. It didn't take much convincing to get her to order one for herself. The life of long lived beings were often hounded by that thing called boredom. She had been extremely bored with the only relief being her grandson and the times her daughter returned back home from school.</p><p><br></p><p>The household work could only occupy her thoughts so much and Zeoticus was always busy with the house business or his private harem. She didn't fault him for it. Time changed the way people thought. She still loved her husband and knew that he loved her just as much. It was just that she needed something new to excite her once more and thus she came upon this game.</p><p><br></p><p>It seems now that this was a bit more than she had expected.</p><p><br></p><p>She wouldn't lie and say she wasn’t worried about her daughter and the others who had started this game too. There is also the fact that more than two weeks have passed and there was no change, showing that the outside world was finding it hard to release them so easily. The Game Master had talked about the soul contract and that had further dulled any hopes of rescue.</p><p><br></p><p>As a Devil, she knew what such contracts could do.</p><p><br></p><p>She had spent around a week gathering all the information she could about these games. It allowed her to think of a plan for the near future. Her combat experience was helping her despite not possessing any of her original power.</p><p><br></p><p>The meeting with the boy had been a coincidence, though she already knew who he was because of the information from Martha. A player who had raced ahead of all others to become a T2 Class holder. She talked to him wanting to know about the tips he could offer to increase the speed of her levelling too while he seemed to be more interested in her skills and job as a Gardener than her body that she had seen many others eying. A welcome change in things that made the little conversation quite pleasant for her too.</p><p><br></p><p>It just had to be ruined by those uncouth idiots.</p><p><br></p><p>She knew this group. They had been arrested on the first day after causing trouble in the village.</p><p><br></p><p>They had been released a week later and had immediately formed a group to hunt together. They had driven several players away from safer hunting grounds as well as stole kills from many others but were left unchecked due to the actions not being illegal in the game. They had harassed several female players and were confronted by several other players but only the Village was a safe zone and whatever happened outside it was fair game. They had picked out several of those confronters and three of them didn't return after a day.</p><p><br></p><p>This had basically given them a boost in confidence. They had eyed her several times but her work as a gardener and her night time hunting times kept their timetables from overlapping, keeping her safe.</p><p><br></p><p>This time it seems that she got caught as collateral.</p><p><br></p><p>All things aside, she had to accept that the fight did get her blood running.</p><p><br></p><p>Unfortunately the same couldn't be said for her new acquaintance.</p><p><br></p><p>She walked towards the boy. He looked at her, eyes wary and she slowly stopped.</p><p><br></p><p>He spoke up, \"The Village, safe zone.\" And got up with unsteady steps, walking towards the village gates.</p><p><br></p><p>She watched the back of the boy and got slightly more respect for him.</p><p><br></p><p>His ability to accept his situation and act on it had impressed her. They hadn't needed more than a single eye contact to know each other's intentions before the attack.</p><p><br></p><p>She liked the decisiveness of the boy. Had it been a normal situation, she would have even considered trying to recruit him into her peerage.</p><p><br></p><p>His words made things clear.</p><p><br></p><p>He didn't trust her, not completely. But he didn't want to be enemies either. He didn't reject her support but pushed his fears and catatonia forcibly behind to wait for a place where he could <em>afford</em> to take her support. She nodded to herself and followed him. Maybe he could be good enough to stick to and wouldn't weigh her down? Just maybe. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>- The Game Master -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He watched the screen as the people were beginning to calm down and accept their situation now.</p><p><br></p><p>Human minds are very adaptive.</p><p><br></p><p>Now his last act in this world will finally begin. His last gift to the world that had given him all he had right now.</p><p><br></p><p>He took a sip of his finest wine, one he had himself made around 800 years ago for this very moment in a Golden Chalice that was the start of it all. The Sephiroth Graal.</p><p><br></p><p>Being reincarnated into a fictional world had been out of a dream for him. The only drawback was the timeline he was reincarnated in. A Thousand and five hundred years before anything that he knew happened. When he realised what exactly the world was, he had panicked and locked himself in to become stronger. Or it might have been, had that motherfucking dragon who had almost toasted his village when fighting with his eternal rival/secret love appeared. He had only survived thanks to his Sacred Gear, using the leftover energy of those two beasts to turn himself into a dragon. The Sephiroth Graal was such a fucking cheat.</p><p><br></p><p>This had however attracted the attention of another insane being and his oldest lover who helped him hide and see what he did, just out of curiosity.</p><p><br></p><p>The world however moved on just as it was supposed to. Apparently the God of the Bible had noticed the absence of the Graal and secretly made a second one. This one after all didn’t contain some special spirit or anything and just the knowledge of the God of the Bible about the Principles of Life and the Soul, which let the user peek into the Knowledge of the Dead.</p><p><br></p><p>He took all this time to train and become stronger. Learn all this world had to teach. Apparently his cheat was the ability to nullify the side effects of the Gear because he could control the thing perfectly from the moment he awakened it. It was like an instinctive knowledge. And when you are not being corrupted by the voices of the dead, they have a lot to talk about.</p><p><br></p><p>Sure, there were times when he wanted to go out and wreck the world, maybe get some waifus but his tastes had changed. Having the Dragon of Dreams as your partner tends to raise the bar a tad bit high for future lovers. He was not interested in weaker waifus. Only the stronger ones attracted his attention now and thus, even after a thousand and five hundred years later, he could only find three lovers in total who could satisfy his skewed and ridiculous standards.</p><p><br></p><p>The Dream, the Infinity and the Sea of Creation.</p><p><br></p><p>When the children of Tiamat, the Mother Goddess had cut her into pieces, they used the ribs to make the Vaults of Heaven and Earth, the eye became the source of River Tigris and the blood was used to bless the land with fertility… but one part still remained and was recovered by someone else.</p><p><br></p><p>The God of the Bible had sealed the last part of the Dragon Goddess Tiamat the ’Womb of Creation’ into the Annihilation Maker, making it able to create monsters at will.</p><p><br></p><p>Great Red had collected the leftover energies of the deceased Mother Goddess, shaping it into a hatchling who grew into the current Dragon King, Tiamat. What he on the other hand did was use his Sephiroth Graal, to revive the original Goddess for himself. </p><p><br></p><p>And finally when it was time for the so called show to start, he was beyond powerful. Even his oldest lover was twice as strong as she was supposed to be and he was stronger than all of his lovers combined.</p><p><br></p><p>He had removed the only weakness against himself, Samael and made himself and his lovers immune to its blood and curse. If he wanted to capture the world right now, he was sure there wasn’t any force in the world that could stop the four of them.</p><p><br></p><p>And yet… and yet, he was done with it. He had already got everything the world could give him. He now wanted to see other worlds. If this one existed, then there was a high chance that others did as well. Creating the portal hadn’t been hard either considering the people behind the creation, but before he left, he wanted the world to remember his name.</p><p><br></p><p>He had gotten everything from this world, so it was only fair to give it something equal in return. The Law of Equivalent Exchange.</p><p><br></p><p>Until now, no one even knew of his existence.</p><p><br></p><p>He had made it as such, erasing his name from any minds that might have known him and keeping his existence a secret.</p><p><br></p><p>But, it didn’t sit right with him to just leave the world without so much as leaving his name on it. And thus came this plan.</p><p><br></p><p>Soul Art Online.</p><p><br></p><p>He in his long life had always seen Humans whine against the Supernaturals, claiming how different the world would have been if they had been in charge. Foolish idiots.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, he was once a human himself. So he decided to humour them. In fact he decided to humour anyone who decided to play his ‘game’</p><p><br></p><p>The Sephiroth Graal could change almost anything. It did change him from the leftover energy of the Heavenly Dragons into what he was now. It gave him access to the nigh infinite knowledge of the dead, their experience… their strengths.</p><p><br></p><p>So he decided to let the entire world have a taste of this.</p><p><br></p><p>He made a Game for them which will test the very limits of their sanity and if they win, he will give them a reward for it… <em>to take their powers from the game into the real world.</em></p><p><br></p><p>Every action has a consequence.</p><p><br></p><p>He was in fact quite delighted to see many of the ‘main cast’ entering the game. He had specifically made sure that they got interested in the game.</p><p><br></p><p>He missed some but he still got some unexpected ones.</p><p><br></p><p>Oh the amount of fun he was going to have in this wonderful game.</p><p><br></p><p>But before that, he needed to make sure that no idiots tried to destroy his hard work.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is the communication device ready, Red?”</p><p><br></p><p>“All set.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Good.”</p><p><br></p><p>He pressed the magic circle in front of him and huge screens made up of mist appeared throughout the territories of the Supernatural World.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hello everyone.” The entire Supernatural World heard his voice. “I'm the one called ‘The Game Master’. Nice to meet you all.” He took a few seconds of pause as the crowds in all the world quieted down. “I'm the creator of ‘Soul Art Online’, you know that wonderful piece of art that’s been on hype in the entire human world. And as someone who has worked for centuries for that, I would not appreciate it, if anyone and I mean <em>anyone</em> tries to ruin the game or harm the players. They signed a soul bound contract with me. If they are forcibly taken out, they will die. If someone does that, I will kill them. Are we clear up to this point?”</p><p><br></p><p>He paused as he watched the faces of some of the leaders who had their relatives locked inside the game.</p><p><br></p><p>“I sincerely hope that you will take my warning seriously. I have worked very hard to create this game and if anyone tries to mess this up, I will make their entire life a living nightmare. Worst part is that I might even go into a fit of rage and decide to do something even more. Believe me, Angry Me is scary. Even I, myself, am scared of Angry Me. So don’t make me angry, alright. Have fun~.”</p><p><br></p><p>Oh, he loved the sound of people raising an uproar.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________________________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author's Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>This is a new Snippet.

If you wanted to increase the price of your products, you could have done it after the people got used to your products. Why do it now? Just for a moment of pride against the petty moves of other houses?” he asked and surprisingly, I sensed no malice from him.</p><p><br></p><p>He was genuinely curious.</p><p><br></p><p>I let out a sigh. “I wasn’t lying when I said that I am not a businessman.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Not being a businessman and being a fool are two different things. That Astaroth girl won’t teach a fool.” He countered.</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled at the mention of my teacher. “Obviously, I had other reasons. More than one in fact. First of all, my products are unlike anything the people of the Underworld have seen before. I knew they were going to be suspicious and even doubtful about the effects. It is only normal to do so. Second, I know the quality and effects of my products. They will without any doubt, kill any kind of competition against us. But this kind of thing is bound to bring people together against me to spread rumours later on.”</p><p><br></p><p>They looked at me curiously so I chuckled. “So I want them to doubt everything from the very start and check to their heart’s content. On one hand any trust I gain from them will be through their own experiences and not based on rumours.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A strange approach….but what else?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I have absolutely no problems working with people, but I do not appreciate it when they try to push me around. Are you telling me that the people who were standing, the Shax, the Amy and their allies would just stand aside and watch as I overtake the entire food industry of the devil race?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No one would. We are devils not angels.” he snorted.</p><p><br></p><p>“Exactly. They made their attitudes very clear when they more or less threatened me on our very first meeting. I had just laughed it off the first day but they pulled today’s stupidity. I don’t like politics and if anything I prefer to remain outside of it doing my own work but that doesn’t mean I will let anyone walk over me. They need to understand that I have a monopoly on these things. They….need me. I don’t need them. This was just a small warning to not try to drag me anywhere.”</p><p><br></p><p>“This was a warning?” He raised an eyebrow.</p><p><br></p><p>“Just twice the price for fifteen years. I am already selling it for a quarter of the price I could. Yes, this is a very small warning.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. Any more reasons?”</p><p><br></p><p>I scratched my cheeks. “I didn’t have enough stocks to provide the entire underworld. It would still need some more time so I created a situation where the outflow would decrease while I can wait for the next harvest. High Ranked Products take a long time to mature. Actually if that reporter had not broached the issue, I would have had my own people who were hidden in the Press to turn the conversation in that direction.” I shrugged. “I guess I shouldn’t have doubted the foolishness of other people.”</p><p><br></p><p>I saw Sirzechs and Serafall’s mouth open slightly at the sudden reveal.</p><p><br></p><p>I really want to get that A Ranked Farm first. There was also the attracting the people from these territories to mine part which I didn’t tell them.</p><p><br></p><p>The old man just snorted a laugh while Runeas burst into a loud burst of laughter.</p><p><br></p><p>“You were already expecting them to do that and played them all by throwing that tantrum.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Basically.”</p><p><br></p><p>Zekram picked up his glass of wine and took another sip. “Did it change taste?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It does that. Seven times to be precise. It’s the Rainbow Fruit Wine.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Mmm. This is good. I would like to place an order for a few bottles.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Lavinia and she nodded before going out of the room to bring more bottles.</p><p><br></p><p>“So let’s come to the final question. Mathias Buné Zagan….what do you want to do in the Underworld?” he asked, seriously this time around.</p><p><br></p><p>“I sincerely wish to work peacefully on my farm. I was not lying when I said that I was planning to make it so that no one ever suffered from hunger in the underworld. Is it really that hard to believe?”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>We stared at each other without any words for a few more seconds after which he picked up his wine glass and gulped everything inside.</p><p><br></p><p>“In that case I welcome you and the Buné and Zagan houses to the Underworld’s stage once more. I hope you can do what you said because things are only going to become tougher from now on. Till now everyone was in the dark but now it’s an open game. As I said before, we are devils not saints. They are going to come after you to protect their interests. I can only hope you will survive. I have not and will not interfere in anything until it concerns the interests of the whole devil race as a whole.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded and Lavy returned at the same time with the bottles. I took it from her and gave it to him. “This is a small gift from me. I hope you like it.”</p><p><br></p><p>He got up and nodded towards me. “I will send you the invitation for the tea when you are free.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I look forward to it.”</p><p><br></p><p>With that he left with Runeas who was jumping, wanting to try the desserts.</p><p><br></p><p>I was left in the room with only Sirzechs and Serafall and my peerage members.</p><p><br></p><p>“So….any more questions?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Job well done.” Serafall gave me a thumbs up while Sirzechs finally let out what seemed like a sigh of relief.</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled while signalling Ingvild to bring out the Emerald Wine and pouring it for them.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs took the glass and gulped it down in one go while Serafall sipped it slowly.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is different.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s the Emerald Wine. Far stronger than the Rainbow Fruit Wine.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The move you pulled today was dangerous.” Sirzechs said, slowly catching a breath.</p><p><br></p><p>“They were asking for it.” I answered. “They had guarantees from you all and yet they were pushing their luck to get concessions even before I started selling in their territories. If I had taken one step back, they would have jumped at the chance.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am not saying you were wrong, just that it was dangerous. After a year or so, when the effects of your products are verified, your position will be far more stable. You can make moves then.”</p><p><br></p><p>True but that would have increased the dangers too.</p><p><br>After a year, I would have had several citizens living under me with my business expanded further. Any rumours and cutoffs they pull would have done greater damage when I had more people to provide for in my territory.</p><p><br></p><p>In the current situation, they will surely pull something like that but the people who come to my territories even with those will be those who actually have trust in me instead of those who are simply here for the profits and such people are less likely to get moved by simple rumours.</p><p><br></p><p>“No need to scold him, Sirzechs. He will not be hearing the end of it from that black hearted businesswoman fiance of his.” Serafall laughed. </p><p><br></p><p>I smiled. She was still miffed about Latia juicing out the Sitri on that Medical Supplies deal.</p><p><br></p><p>But yeah, she would be mad.</p><p><br></p><p>I can’t tell her about the System and why I did such a thing and this will make her work harder.</p><p><br></p><p>“Realising it now, are you? Anyways, after such a blatant slap they will stop pestering you to join their faction for a while. Just be more careful. The real problems will come from outside the Underworld.” Serafall said seriously.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>The other two factions.</p><p><br></p><p>We nodded and after a few drinks, left the room.</p><p><br></p><p>I still had to meet with several people today.</p><p><br></p><p>Later that day, I was approached by Zeoticus who had some interesting company.</p><p><br></p><p>“Congratulations Mathias. Today’s show was….surprising.” Zeoticus said.</p><p><br></p><p>“I personally think his attitude was perfect when dealing with such blatant bullying.” Lord Phenex said. “It’s better not to entertain foolishness.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you enjoy the food?” I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“It would be impossible not to.” He offered me a hand and we shook hands. He then turned and looked at the last person.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy came forward, slightly down but spoke nonetheless. “I apologise for my behaviour during our last meeting. I was completely out of line.” Riser bowed and apologised.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s fine. Don’t worry about it.” I waved it off and we shook hands. “You can come over to play at my farm sometimes.” I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t dislike the guy.</p><p><br></p><p>He was crushing on Rias and reacted stupidly at the news of our engagement.</p><p><br></p><p>People do stupid things due to heartbreaks.</p><p><br></p><p>It was nothing new.</p><p><br></p><p>At least he was not malicious.</p><p><br></p><p>We talked about a few things and he was far more calm today.</p><p><br></p><p>One by one, all my allies approached and congratulated me.</p><p><br></p><p>Septus and his brother Lord Agares weren’t bothered and were actually supportive of my actions too.</p><p><br></p><p>I saw the Gremory and Astaroth off before they left.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias was with Venelana and in her princess look due to the crowd around us.</p><p><br></p><p>Latia was mad. I could <em>feel</em> it. But she didn’t say anything in front of others.</p><p><br></p><p>Lord Astaorth looked a bit off.</p><p><br></p><p>The man had always been weird around me but then again I have had next to no contact with him so who knows. </p><p><br></p><p>The surprising thing was the extinct houses also coming and doing the same.</p><p><br></p><p>They didn’t have their previous political power in the Underworld but that didn’t mean they were useless.</p><p><br></p><p>After a few hours, I paid a visit to my other stores in the Leviathan, Beelzebub and Asmodeus cities.</p><p><br></p><p>It was almost midnight when we got back home.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone in my peerage was tired. It was not physical exhaustion but rather mental so I didn’t ask them anything either and all of us went directly to bed.</p><p><br></p><p>Ingvild and Lavinia joined me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Were you scared today?” I asked while brushing Ingvild’s hair as she cuddled to my side.</p><p><br></p><p>She shook her head. “I know you will not let anything happen to me.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>This girl was too sweet.</p><p><br></p><p>I hugged her tighter and Lavy held her hand too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yup. I will not let anything happen to you, any of you.” I rubbed her back before turning to face her and placed a kiss on her forehead.</p><p><br></p><p>“Me too, me too.” Lavy protested before kissing my cheeks so I returned the favour.</p><p><br></p><p>We just lay there. It had finally started.</p><p><br></p><p>The thing I had been preparing for since the day I was reborn, is here.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I opened my eyes the next morning to see an angry blonde in front of the bed</p><p><br></p><p>“G-Good Morning?” I greeted as I stretched my body, slowly getting up trying not to disturb the two sleeping girls.</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t make any noise either and waited for me to leave the room first.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you enjoy making my work harder, Matty?” She spoke as soon as we walked together.</p><p><br></p><p>I pulled her into a hug. She resisted a bit but I held on and she relaxed a bit.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am not letting go of it even if you do this.” She spoke slowly.</p><p><br></p><p>“I know.” I replied, continuing the hug. “I just want to hug you right now.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmph.” She snorted but didn’t say anything.</p><p><br></p><p>Almost a minute later, I sensed that she had calmed down so I pulled back a bit.</p><p><br></p><p>“Now, why did you do that?” She asked me, a hand on her waist, tapping one foot on the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>I led her to the living room and made her sit on a couch beside me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. Let me explain.” I gave her the reasons I had given Zekram and Sirzechs.</p><p><br></p><p>A larger part of her anger had subsided from that hug so she was actually listening.</p><p><br></p><p>“There were far better methods of doing that. Also, I am pretty sure we had enough products to sell for a year or two and you even had those corpses of the Demonic Beasts as food.” She countered.</p><p><br></p><p>I need those for points, but how to tell her that.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly I had an idea.</p><p><br></p><p>“Those wouldn’t last a half year when we implement the Ocean Plan. Not to mention, I need a large part of that stock for the increasing Ranch. You know how much I am budgeting the feed.”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at me with slightly narrowed eyes, probably understanding that I was hiding something but didn’t call me out on it. I appreciated this understanding between us.</p><p><br></p><p>Dammit, now I feel guilty.</p><p><br></p><p>So I hugged her to my side. “Please….trust me on this.”</p><p><br></p><p>She let out a breath and spoke. “Alright. But….you will need to tell me if you want to do something like this in advance.”</p><p><br></p><p>“....I will. Just trust me when I say that I need this for something extremely important.” I explained and albeit reluctantly, she agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>“To be honest….the only reason I didn’t tell you was because you wouldn’t like this…. unconventional method of mine.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Unconventional method? Of what? Picking a fight, because let me tell you, it’s nothing new.” She snorted.</p><p><br></p><p>“I mean you are not wrong.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you know how much of the future plans I have to change? I couldn’t sleep last night thinking of the steps we would need to take to counter anything they pull.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Actually, I believe you will have an easier time negotiating with them when you do. They do need our products more than we need theirs. After all, we can get everything they provide from outside but they cannot get our products from anywhere. This is something which cannot be changed. But let’s leave this aside for a while. Our products are out. All we need now is for people to test them and that needs time. Have you had any breakfast before coming here?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Her stomach growled as a slight blush grew on her face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Great, then I will get something ready in just a moment.” I walked into the kitchen to make her something good for all her hard work.</p><p><br></p><p>We had a quick breakfast and got down to discuss the topic of today’s work.</p><p><br></p><p>All members of my peerage were here.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Armin had arrived to check up on me.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias was spending more time with Venelana, for her lessons but she always sent her Peerage Members to help me. Although, they mostly played with Gasper and Valerie….but even that was a job well done.</p><p><br></p><p>“Expanding the farms is the most important thing right now. We need to provide enough for the sales. Now that your identity is not hidden anymore, you can increase the farm area without restrictions.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s….not that easy.” I sighed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why?” Latia asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Providing security for such a huge area is not going to be easy.” Armin provided.</p><p><br></p><p>“Exactly. Even now, the wards I have put around my farms are maintained by borrowing slight bits of powers from my Dryads and all the animals in the ranch but most of all, Leafa. Expanding without that would mean leaving the crops unprotected which is a sureshot way to get robbed.”</p><p><br></p><p>If Leafa were to grow to A+ Rank however, I doubt that would be a problem as she could then take down most of the enemies without any problems.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, I could be secure if my Dryads evolve into B- rank as they will get their final evolution then and look almost like normal humans and even be able to move great distances from the farm.</p><p><br></p><p>And all of this ties to my A Rank Farm Upgrade.</p><p><br></p><p>“So what do we do?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“We make our Dryads and dragons stronger and get even more of them. Why do you think I was begging to keep the Demonic Beast corpses in the farm?” I chuckled as she blushed at our previous argument.</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing her flustered, I reassured her. “Don’t worry. I can make slightly weaker wards around the place. My hunting squads have been mostly free after the hunts and will be able to protect them. It’s just that it will reduce the speed of expansion a bit.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you planning to do all that alone?” She asked me incredulously.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have been doing it till now but I doubt I can do it for the whole place. We would probably need to get in contact with some wardmasters. Not for the areas where I grow the high-end products, even placing smaller wards would need a lot of work.”</p><p><br></p><p>She thought for a while.</p><p><br></p><p>“Actually….if it’s the matter of wards then no other house in the Underworld is better than the Dantalion.” She began. “And….we do have connections to a Dantalion.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Who else? Elsa Gremory, the wife of Sirzechs Lucifer and Rias’ sister in law. She was a Dantalion and not just any Dantalion either but the younger sister of the current Lord.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah yes. She is from the Dantalion House.” I almost forgot about it.</p><p><br></p><p>“She herself is quite an accomplished wardmaster.” Armin threw in his two bits.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, I will need to talk to her.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Actually, let me do the talking.” She interrupted, throwing me an annoyed look.</p><p><br></p><p>Dammit, I thought I had already calmed all of that down.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly I had a thought. “He….wasn’t among the people who stood up yesterday, was he?”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“You didn’t even see who was standing?” She asked, her headache picking up once more.</p><p><br></p><p>Well I didn’t but no way I could tell her that.</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm, I was just checking.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmph. No. He wasn’t standing. He is a supporter of the current Satans due to his relation to Sirzechs.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh alright. That makes sense.”</p><p><br></p><p>Latia let out a sigh while Armin just shook his head with a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good then. It’s decided. I will get in touch with the Dantalion first. In the meanwhile, you can slowly increase the size of the farm in your own way.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Deal.”</p><p><br></p><p>We discussed a few more things before leaving for our own work.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Azazel -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“So these are the things the Zagan brat is selling?” He picked up what looked like an apple and took a bite. “Oh, this <em>is</em> good. How many could we get?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Not many this quick. They are only selling a predetermined amount at a time. Buying some from the devils was hard. They are reselling it at a sky high price.” Shemhazai responded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Any results of the tests? Do they really do what the kid was saying or was it just a publicity stunt to get more customers?”</p><p><br></p><p>Shemhazai handed him the reports. “We have only been able to test one or two products but they….did have effects similar to what had been claimed.”</p><p><br></p><p>He frowned as he read more of the report.</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t understand how he can make these.” Shemhazai muttered, walking around back and forth in the room. “Even his ancestor was not this crazy. I mean sure there have been food items which can increase the strength of the people and grant them powers in almost every mythology….but no one could make so many and so easily.”</p><p><br></p><p>He tossed the file aside and played the video of the conference which was held at the opening of the shop.</p><p><br></p><p>“Can these items be grown if we get their seeds? Replicated in any way?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Shemhazai shook his head. “No. They cannot. That was the first thing I checked after verifying their veracity.”</p><p><br></p><p>He took a deep breath before watching the video further.</p><p><br></p><p>“Pfft. The kid slapped the faces of those assholes real good. I guess he has some measure of anger against those people due to the treatment he had received all this time? Gives us something to work with.”</p><p><br></p><p>He wished those fools would act the way they normally do and pressure him so that he could get a chance.</p><p><br></p><p>He as well as other cadres have been thinking about countermeasures against the kid since his identity and life magic were revealed.</p><p><br></p><p>They came to some conclusions.</p><p><br></p><p>First, he was very close to the Satans. They valued him enough to engage their family members to him, completely tying him to their side.</p><p><br></p><p>Second, killing him would be nigh impossible due to these same relations. Moreover, his own abilities were completely unknown.</p><p><br></p><p>Even if he were just a High Class Devil, the Life Magic made his strength completely unpredictable.</p><p><br></p><p>They would need at least an Ultimate Class to have any surety and that was if they could get past whatever guard was prepared for him.</p><p><br></p><p>Those four had been this secretive about him. There was no way they would let him go unprotected.</p><p><br></p><p>Not that people wouldn’t try.</p><p><br></p><p>He just needed to make sure that whoever tried was not traced back to his side first.</p><p><br></p><p>At this point, he was stuck between a rock and a hard place.</p><p><br></p><p>“What do we do now, Azazel?” Shemhazai asked. “If the devils are given time, they would completely surpass us like this. Something needs to be done or we would be helpless if another….another war ever happens.”</p><p><br></p><p>He tapped on his table while thinking.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will contact Michael. Heaven must be just as worried if not more because they had sacrificed Saraqiel to get rid of Zagan. And then we confront the Satans together. Till then, keep everyone in check.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Michael -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“The products were tested and the results match.” Raphael reported.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>There was a moment of silence which was broken by Uriel.</p><p><br></p><p>“We had made sure to not leave any of them behind, so how did this boy survive?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It doesn’t matter how he survived but that he did and he might be just as dangerous if not more.” Raphael replied before looking at him. “What steps should we take, brother?”</p><p><br></p><p>“What else, we need to take him down as soon as possible or he will become too big of a danger to Heaven. Did you forget the danger his ancestor was and the sacrifice Saraqiel had to make for our sake?” Uriel said.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. No one had forgotten that. It was for that reason that the entire Heaven and Grigori had been shaken with the discovery of a single child with that power.</p><p><br></p><p>The power to create life.</p><p><br></p><p>Very few people were capable of such a feat and without an exception, all of them had their names etched in the annals of history.</p><p><br></p><p>His father and brother both had this ability and while not to the same extent, Zagan had the same power.</p><p><br></p><p>While his creations might not have high intelligence, that never made them any less useful in wars.</p><p><br></p><p>Saraqiel was someone almost rivalling him in strength and he had to go on with his life as a sacrifice to take down that one devil, that alone was enough to remind anyone of the degree of danger such a power possessed.</p><p><br></p><p>“We are not in any position to start a war and this boy is related to both Sirzechs Lucifer and Ajuka Beelzebub. If anything happens to him, they would stop at nothing to get back at the perpetrators.” Raphael answered.</p><p><br></p><p>He took a deep breath. “I was contacted by Azazel for a meeting regarding this matter. I will have a talk with him first and then we will decide how to progress from there.”</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly remembering something, he asked. “By the way, can these products be consumed by others?”</p><p><br></p><p>“You are not planning to….?” Uriel started but Raphael stopped him with a reply.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Despite being made by him, it doesn’t contain even the slightest trace of Demonic Power. It has no bad effects on any race and can be consumed by anyone without any side-effects.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see.”</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t speak any further and closed his eyes thinking of a plan.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly remembering something, he spoke. “Didn’t the Satans send Rudiger Rozenkreutz’s request for meeting Dulio?”</p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://“Yes….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">“Yes….it</a> happened a month ago. Apparently it was a wish of Rudiger Rozenkreutz’s son who is suffering from being born with a Sacred Gear. The boy is a fan of Dulio and wished to meet him. We haven’t answered it yet, Dulio hasn’t been back from his mission and we were not sure of their intentions and Dulio is one of our trump cards so sending him there….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Fulfilling a child’s wish, which might as well be his very last, is something we should try to do regardless of his race. After all, the child must be half human for being born with a Sacred Gear, the same thing which is taking his life. We too hold some manner of responsibility for this so agree to their request.”</p><p><br></p><p>His siblings nodded and he added. “....and ask for a chance to meet Mathias Buné Zagan in return. They will agree to it.”</p><p><br></p><p>Normally Michael didn’t like using these tactics but….there were times where he had to make tough decisions. Filling his Father’s shoes was a nigh impossible job. So he could only do this….</p><p><br></p><p>“Before we take any actions, we need to meet this guy, know what kind of person he is. Times have changed and we need to take actions accordingly.” He said, still in thought.</p><p><br></p><p>Uriel looked a bit unwilling but Raphael and Gabriel agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Very well, then this is what we will do.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Mathias -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“So, how are the sales going?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>It had been a week since the opening of the hotel and things were calming down a bit.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked exhausted but there was a brightness in his eyes which couldn’t be hidden.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy was actually happy to work.</p><p><br></p><p>“A bit lower than expected. We are still in the green and slowly increasing our profits so no need to worry about it. Statements made by Armin and the reports from the Devil Research and Development Department, vouching for the veracity of your products helped a lot. In fact, several other houses also came out to support us. The Emperor Diehauser Belial and the former Dragon King Tannin were among them. All this caused the rumours to be sidelined and our businesses were affected much.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That is mostly because the shops are in the Satan cities and those Pillars have no control over it. Not that they have spared no effort to spread rumours about it.” Latia said, but not before throwing a look at me.</p><p><br></p><p>She was over it already but was still annoyed that I pulled such a thing without consulting with her….especially since the two of us are supposed to be working together.</p><p><br></p><p>I understood her feelings so I didn’t say anything</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded before summoning a huge pile of paper on the table in front of us.</p><p><br></p><p>“These are the information about the people who are planning to live in the Buné and the Zagan territories.”</p><p><br></p><p>Then he summoned another, albeit a smaller pile of files. “And this is the information about people who want to open businesses in our territory.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>I have seen and done many things which would be beyond any normal person’s imaginations.</p><p><br></p><p>I had singlehandedly recovered the Buné and Zagan territories.</p><p><br></p><p>I had stood in front of Great Red and told him to fuck off.</p><p><br></p><p>And in all this, I had never felt the fear I was feeling right now.</p><p><br></p><p>Motherfu….</p><p><br></p><p>“How many papers are there?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Twelve thousand more or less.” he answered unphased before summoning another magic circle.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>And another huge pile of paper was bundled on the floor. This pile was almost as big as the rest combined.</p><p><br></p><p>“These were sent by Lord Pheles. These magicians wanted to make contracts with you. He said there were none for your peerage members as they didn’t exhibit their abilities in public but when they do, there will be more. For now, he sent his congratulations for breaking the second place record of Euclid Lucifuge.”</p><p><br></p><p>My mind blanked and when I gathered my bearings again, I turned towards Latia before taking her hands in mine.</p><p><br></p><p>“Have I told you how pretty you look today?”</p><p><br></p><p>She rolled her eyes while uncle just chuckled.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am not even touching the contracts and residents' piles. I will however take the business requests.” She said calmly.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“This much is nothing, Mathias. When you complete all your plans for the territory, I believe your territories will be the most populous one in the entire Underworld.” Logan said as if throwing cold water on my dreams of peacefully farming.</p><p><br></p><p>I need to find someone to do these for me, but who?</p><p><br></p><p>And as if the world had heard my wish, there was a knock on the door.</p><p><br></p><p>“Come in.”</p><p><br></p><p>It was Shizuka.</p><p><br></p><p>She faced Latia and spoke.”Miss. Rias has sent a message that her sister-in-law has fixed a meeting with Lord Dantalion two days later. Both of you are invited to the Dantalion House to discuss the matter over dinner.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. I will inform them that we are thankful for their invitation.” Latia replied, nodding at her.</p><p><br></p><p>While she was doing this, I looked at Shizuka and had a sudden idea.</p><p><br></p><p>I picked up one of the documents and handed it to Shizuka. “Can you check this, please?”</p><p><br></p><p>She raised an eyebrow but took a look at the document nonetheless and after a moment nodded at me. “Yes. This is simple.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Great!” I cheered while Latia just facepalmed. “Then from today onwards, you will be responsible for the work of overlooking the documents of the people who want to reside in my territories.”</p><p><br></p><p>Go on and take care of all the paperwork for me.</p><p><br></p><p>I name thee the Dragon of Paperwork, the one who will bring the end of all the Paperwork hahahaha. </p><p><br></p><p>She nodded stoically.</p><p><br></p><p>Now that a major problem had been taken care of, I was feeling far more relaxed….until Latia poured cold water on my thoughts once more.</p><p><br></p><p>“You do realise that you will have to answer the requests for the Contract Magician yourself, right?”</p><p><br></p><p>I almost banged my head on the table….almost.</p><p><br></p><p>“You can hire people for these kinds of jobs too. They can review the information of the Magicians and send a general reply and pick out some people for you to make contracts with. Right now, the most important thing is to find a way to provide jobs for the ones coming to your territory. You cannot let all the other houses take the lead in this or they will have a greater control of your territory’s economy than you, and that never ends well. It is exactly why several houses went bankrupt and were declared extinct. We could try to restart the previous businesses of the Buné and Zagan houses for starters and then go from there. As for the places for them to live, we can just renovate the abandoned buildings from the last time till we have enough funds to make new ones.” Uncle suggested.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s a good idea. You can start working on that. If you need anything for that, just tell me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Right now, nothing except funds. I know we are short on funds so I will just try to contact my friends and get skilled people for work. We can slowly expand.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We are not exactly short on funds.” I stopped him and Latia explained further.</p><p><br></p><p>“We still have funds from selling the Demonic Beast corpses as well as several deals with Satan Asmodeus to provide rations for the army, the Sitri house for Medical Supplies, the Gremorys and my own father for raw materials. You can give me an estimate and I will issue the funds.”</p><p><br></p><p>There was also the investment I had made in the human world which was giving out outputs now.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked surprised. “The Demonic Beasts? I thought the Satans cleared the beasts….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Not really. That’s just something we told the public.” I explained making him open his mouth wide in surprise as he looked at me. “I told you to not worry about anything else, didn’t I?” I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, that’s something I cannot deny.” Latia nodded, reassuring him too.</p><p><br></p><p>He shrugged off his surprise and quickly pointed out several more things we could use in that case. “There are several mines in the Buné Territories. They had to be abandoned because the whole area was taken over by Demonic Beasts as it was near the pits….but if we can provide protection to the people, then we can easily reopen those mines and provide jobs for the people.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded. “Alright, my hunting squads have been idle since we finished clearing the areas. They will get some work to do now.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Last but not the least, you will have to set the taxes which will be collected in your territory as well as set your own laws on top of the general laws of the Underworld in your territory. And please….don’t skip these. This part will be too important.” He then turned towards Latia. “Please drag him if you have to but get it done.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the man stunned at the sudden betrayal of trust.</p><p><br></p><p>And what the fuck do you mean drag me?</p><p><br></p><p>The most worrying part was her nodding and reassuring him.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will see it done.”</p><p><br></p><p>Well two can play at this game….see if I don’t tattle to your wife about this.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next few hours, we discussed several ways to provide jobs for the people.</p><p><br></p><p>Most of them consisted of opening several industries related to processing food items as starters.</p><p><br></p><p>We will add more industries as the number of people increases later on.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“....And now they are being sore losers, can you believe it?” I complained as I lay down watching the purple underworld sky.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmph, well done. They should have thought better than to try to threaten a dragon.” Tia humphed as she took a bite of one of her dragon apples.</p><p><br></p><p>“Exactly. They have been in their position, overlooking others for so long that they have forgotten how to accept denials. Well, now they have to learn it because there is no way I am backing down.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I would be very disappointed if you did.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.” I nodded, then remembering something else, I broached another subject. </p><p><br></p><p>“Yes?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Tannin invited me to his territory and in return I invited him and his boys to my farm for some spars. I think it would be good for the kids at the farm to meet dragons from outside the farm.”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked in thought for a second and nodded. “Yes. That will be good. While your farm provides a very unique place for them to grow, that’s not how dragons normally grow. I will go back and push them to train harder. Friendly visit or not, those kids were taught by me. I will not allow them to get defeated.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yup. They have been huddled in the farm for too long. Greenhouses are not places to grow dragons. I think Crom has taken some of them with me outside to train.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Those were the rowdiest of the bunch but still hatchlings. That dragon might have a thousand problems but no one can blame him for not working hard. Those three hatchlings will turn out fine, if not a bit violent.” Tia nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s what I am worried about.</p><p><br></p><p>Those hatchlings were of Elder Dragons from the Monster Hunter world.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t know if Crom has the ability to see the potential of dragons but that guy chose the most talented of the bunch in a single glance….but then again it might just be him choosing the most territorial and violent of the bunch.</p><p><br></p><p>“So. how are you feeling now?” She asked, crushing my hair.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“You looked like you were exhausted. Is the new work taking a toll on your mind?”</p><p><br></p><p>“More or less. It’s….exhausting. All I have been doing is running around attending meetings, dinners, parties, bla bla bla. The worst part is that I can’t even reject all of them. Truthfully, the work at the farm is far easier than this. Most of these people speak something but feel something completely different. In a way, I regret learning Senjutsu.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You shouldn’t regret learning such a useful trick. Something which can see through the heart of others is always useful. Betrayal can take down the best of us.” She spoke sorrowfully, maybe remembering the fate of her own mother who was betrayed and killed by her own kids.</p><p><br></p><p>I held her hand and brought it over my chest.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>No words were spoken for a while before she broke the silence.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are not slacking off in your training due to all this work, are you?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Five <a href=\"https://years….no\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">years….no</a> give me four years, I will give you that fight.” I said, recalculating something.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am far stronger than I used to be.” She warned.</p><p><br></p><p>And she was not wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>She was a veritable A Rank now. Although the rank itself was extremely broad, with the gulf between someone at the beginning of the Rank and the end of the Rank like Indra, being as large as heaven and earth, she was still someone who could trounce someone like Sirzechs and Ajuka like kids.</p><p><br></p><p>“I know that’s why I said five years at first but trust me, I can get there in four years if I push myself harder.”</p><p><br></p><p>She eyed me curiously and then rolled her eyes. “I don’t think you know exactly how strong I am right now.”</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled at her comment. “Trust me, I know exactly how strong you are. Senjutsu, remember.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And you are still claiming to get there in four years?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Have I ever lied to you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then I will wait for you.” She replied before leaning in and kissing my forehead.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Markus Shax -</strong></p><p><br></p><p><em>Crash</em></p><p><br></p><p>“Dammit! All of his damned products work exactly as he claimed them to.” He threw the glass of wine in his hand as it shattered after hitting against the wall.</p><p><br></p><p>“We have already done whatever we could to spread the rumours but they are not as effective as he has the approval of Ajuka Beelzebub and Euclid Lucifuge. People are still buying the products even if they have doubts about the veracity about the effects because it has better taste than anything we can acquire. If this goes on, they will notice the effects of these products and all these rumours will be useless.” Albus replied.</p><p><br></p><p>The Amy and the Shax were together in this. Both of them controlled almost all the food industries and distribution channels of the Underworld.</p><p><br></p><p>Any business in the field had to bow down to them or be crushed.</p><p><br></p><p>They had done so with several houses before this.</p><p><br></p><p>The Halphas, Vepar and Valefor were among the top of this list.</p><p><br></p><p>These houses had major shares in the food industry after the Civil War and had refused to cooperate with them. With slight help from their allies, they had driven these houses to extinction due to bankruptcy.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, the devils of these houses couldn’t even get appointments with them.</p><p><br></p><p>And now this brat….he will pay. Markus will make him pay for the insult.</p><p><br></p><p>“The rumours wouldn’t have lasted either as Falbium Asmodeus has signed a contract with the accursed brat for getting products for the army. I guess he was waiting for this for a while as he had put off renewing the contract with us. They were waiting for the brat’s Lordships to be revealed.” Albus gritted his teeth.</p><p><br></p><p>“Can we grow those crops on our own?” he asked his Queen.</p><p><br></p><p>As long as the seeds spread, his products will be useless.</p><p><br></p><p>They might not be able to make new products like a Zagan but they could very easily grow them from the seeds.</p><p><br></p><p>“No Sir. None of them could be replicated. If we got the plants directly, we might have some hope but otherwise, there is no hope.”</p><p><br></p><p>Getting the plants directly?</p><p><br></p><p>“How about the spies we had sent to his territory? What did they find?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Nothing Sir. They have been assigned a temporary place to stay till all their identities are verified and registered but most of them haven’t been able to move around much. Some who did, reported that the entire land around the main Buné House is under heavy wards, the likes of which is rarely seen in the Underworld. Some were even saying those might be comparable to the ones on the castles of the Satans. We doubt that Ajuka Beelzebub himself made those wards to protect the brat.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Tch….I thought that the brat was just licking the boots of those four when he said they were doing everything to protect him in the last few years, in the council meeting….but it seems that they have actually put some effort behind the brat. Still….if there were wards around the main house area, then what about the farms? They are the most important part.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That Sir….the wards spanned over several tens of kilometres. We didn’t see any farm area outside. Some suspect there were different dimensions inside similar to the spaces created for Rating Games….” His queen reported awkwardly.</p><p><br></p><p>He stared blankly at the man.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you insane! Do you know what you are talking about? Several tens of kilometres of area, covered in wards comparable to the finest ones in the Underworld….do you even know how much energy that would consume? How would they even support that kind of warding system? Not  even the four Satans sitting there and powering the wards could do that. Your spies have been duped. Have them recheck. It must be some kind of illusion to fool weaker devils. Send someone stronger this time.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Sir.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And tell them to find the location of the farms. They will surely hire people for their farms. Try to push your people inside those numbers to get direct information from inside his farm. What about the business proposals we had sent them?”</p><p><br></p><p>Many houses wanted to establish businesses in those territories to get a grip over the economy of the territory.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, despite all the potential of his products, it was a fact that he hadn’t had any time to get enough resources.</p><p><br></p><p>Both the Buné and the Zagan were almost considered extinct due to the economic conditions and low numbers.</p><p><br></p><p>They didn’t have enough money to provide the people they take in their territory, especially considering the fact that creating such products must take a lot of money.</p><p><br></p><p>It could be financial aid from the four Satans or even the Research and Development Department or the houses of the four Satans, probably the Gremorys and the Astaroths but there would still be a limit to that seeing how much he was spending in all his new hotels and everything.</p><p><br></p><p>He would <em>need</em> businesses of other houses to come to his territory and help him provide jobs for the people and he would <em>need</em> to take loans from other houses….and they were waiting for just that.</p><p><br></p><p>His queen winced slightly. “About that….all of them were rejected.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That brat….” he gritted his teeth.</p><p><br></p><p>“It wasn’t him. It was his fiance, Latia Astaroth.”</p><p><br></p><p>This caught them by surprise..</p><p><br></p><p>“Latia Astaroth, the niece of Ajuka Beelzebub.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes sir.”</p><p><br></p><p>“How is she involved in all of this? If I remember correctly, she isn’t even of age. How old was she? Sixteen or seventeen.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sixteen and half years old. She is the one who takes care of the business aspect of the Buné and Zagan houses as what Mathias Buné Zagan said was indeed not false. He truly never involves himself with business. She takes almost all the decisions and he accepts them. What he did that day….was him acting independently.”</p><p><br></p><p>The Astaroth girl?</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>Something was absolutely wrong in this scene.</p><p><br></p><p>How would a sixteen or seventeen year old know about the intricacies of business? It must be her family or rather the four Satans pulling the strings from behind.</p><p><br></p><p>They had invested too much effort in keeping the brat out of public view and pulled him to their side. They wouldn’t leave him unsupervised.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wasn’t Leila Astaroth, the mother of Astaroth, also his teacher?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Sir.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Tell me everything you have found out about the relationship between them.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes sir. Leila Astaroth has been his teacher for the last six years where he met her daughter, Latia Astaroth. They have known each other for a long time and on her twelfth birthday, he had gifted her an Earth Dragon Hatchling, which many people had presumed as him courting her but the boy had denied any such claims. According to the information we could collect, he was the one who proposed and a marriage contract was established between them. She is going to be taking the position of Lady Zagan after the marriage while Rias Gremory will be taking the position of Lady Buné. It is expected that all three sides were planning this marriage for a long time and only announced this on the day of his reveal.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What roles does Latia Astaroth play in his businesses?” He asked, as he tried to figure out everything.</p><p><br></p><p>Marriage was indeed the easiest way to control a house like the current Zagan and Buné. There was no way those four Satans would miss this. They even engaged the relatives of both the anomalies to the brat to stake their claims.</p><p><br></p><p>And now, with two such names already in line for the main wives, anyone who went next would have a hard time getting the share of that pie.</p><p><br></p><p>His queen continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“Not just our deals but rather all of his business deals are made by her. She completely rejected all our deals and pointed out changes in them which, while giving us profit, would remove any way for us to control the economy of the Buné or Zagan territory. From what we have been able to find, she was also the one who made deals with Falbium Asmodeus and they also signed some kind of deals with the Gremory, Sitri and the Agares Houses although the details are not clear. All these deals combined with the marriage contracts between these houses makes their alliances rock solid and provides Mathias Buné Zagan with a very powerful economic and political backing.”</p><p><br></p><p>He sat down and poured another glass of whiskey and took a sip.</p><p><br></p><p>“Anything else. Any weaknesses?”</p><p><br></p><p>His queen looked in thought. “If I had to point out a weakness, it would be his overdependence on Latia Astaroth for making decisions about his businesses. In fact, I was able to find that not all members of the Astaroth house were in the know about his actual identity and might not have the best relations with him.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh?!” He asked, suddenly interested.</p><p><br></p><p>“The current Heir of the Astaroth house, Diodora Astaroth has a very shaky relationship with him. And not just him, all his friends like the younger cousin of Armin Glasya-Labolas, Zephyrdor Glasya-Labolas and from certain rumours, even Lord Astaroth didn’t have any high opinion about the boy before his name was revealed.”</p><p><br></p><p>And he picked a fight with the Phenex House due to the engagement with the Gremory girl.</p><p><br></p><p>One by one the pieces came to his mind as a plan started taking form.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t we have the five hundredth anniversary of our beverage business a month later?”</p><p><br></p><p>The other people in the room were suddenly taken aback at the sudden change of topic.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes sir.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Send some invitations for me.”</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/cross-crossroads\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/cross-crossroads</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Back to back two chapters.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Mathias’ tutorial period is over and the game has started for real.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The main faction leaders are going to be collecting more information, even sending people to meet him.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The other Pillars, on the other hand, are going to try their best to bring him down.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>We still didn’t get the reactions of the Church, the Old Satan faction and the other factions.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>That will happen in time.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>",

There was obviously a lot of hesitation among the normal people as the prices of the products were still not revealed and normal devils were wondering if they could afford it and if the price would even be worth it.</p><p><br></p><p>The first week’s sale was going to make a lot of difference.</p><p><br></p><p>All four Satans were going to appear at the opening of the hotel and I had sent invitations to all the Pillar Houses, even those which were declared extinct as well as all the Extra Demon houses to join the ceremony.</p><p><br></p><p>“So what’s going on in your mind, Matty?” Uncle Logan asked, as he approached me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wondering how many houses will turn up for today's event.”</p><p><br></p><p>He let out a wry smile. “All of them. I doubt there would be any houses who would be absent today. Are you still angry about the funeral?” he asked, patting my shoulder.</p><p><br></p><p>“I was never angry at them for not showing up, Uncle. I mean it would be foolish to be angry at people because they did not consider me important when I was expressly trying to hide that very thing. What I am annoyed about is them pretending that they cared.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry about them. Why even bother about them and give them a free room in your head when they didn’t give you the same courtesy.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded. “Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>There was a moment of quiet between us.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do we need anything else, uncle?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Nothing for now. I have already arranged for everything I could and even added the things which your fiancé asked me for. Seriously, that girl has a good head on her shoulders. She said that she was going to arrive with her family today so she sent a list of things to me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. She tends to worry a lot.” I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Probably a good thing for you.” He chuckled.</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, you can move into the Buné family’s core area with aunt and Ladora. I will have a mansion built for you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh, us? Moving there? No no. I am already comfortable in my new home in this place. The business will need me to constantly run around between the four cities and this place is the best to manage such things.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, alright. If you insist. Still, I would suggest that you send Ladora to train at the farm sometimes. It would be good if he gets to the Ultimate Class at least. As our business expands….so will the dangers.”</p><p><br></p><p>I suggested and a serious look took over his face as he nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>This was going to be a problem.</p><p><br></p><p>After my business expanded, people were going to target everyone in my family.</p><p><br></p><p>Right now, only Ladora and his parents qualify for that.</p><p><br></p><p>My peerage members rarely ever went out of the territory and when they are in the territory, they are always surrounded by the army of dragons and dryads. Not to mention, almost all of them were strong enough to put up a fight against an Ultimate Class being and they will only get stronger in time.</p><p><br></p><p>As for my fiances, I doubt anyone would try to go after them due to their families.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mathias.” He suddenly called me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“....you don’t have to answer this if you don’t want to but….”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the man, feeling his hesitation. “What?”</p><p><br></p><p>“How strong are you? I mean I know you are stronger than what you showed in the Rating Game but I just….”</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled. The man was both worried and curious and still hesitated to not offend me.</p><p><br></p><p>“How long did that match take?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>He was taken aback at my sudden question.</p><p><br></p><p>“Around eight minutes.” He answered, unsure of my intentions.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s say if I were to go all out, even if it were Ruval Phenex instead of Riser… I could have ended it within the same time.” I smiled, reassuring him.</p><p><br></p><p>I was not boasting. I could indeed end the whole fight in eight minutes, even earlier if I went all out.</p><p><br></p><p>But there was no need to show off too many of my cards.</p><p><br></p><p>His mouth opened a bit at my reveal.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, don’t worry about anything uncle. You just do business with ease of your heart. I am here. Noone will bully us any more.”</p><p><br></p><p>His shocked face turned into a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good. Good. Brother and Sister-in-Law would have been proud of you. Good.” His eyes watered a bit as he controlled his voice.</p><p><br></p><p>The Buné have really been looked down on too much and this was even worse for him, someone who married a human and had a half devil child. Although the guy never regretted his decision of marrying his wife, the constant taunts and shunning would get to anyone.</p><p><br></p><p>One last check later, it was almost time and my peerage members arrived first except Tia and Crom who were not at the farm.</p><p><br></p><p>As for the protection and security of the farm, there was a small army of Ultimate Class dryads and dragons to protect the whole place with Leafa as the last line of defence.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked outside the window and a large crowd could be seen waiting below.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s go. It’s time we start the event.”</p><p><br></p><p>I walked out, followed by my peerage members.</p><p><br></p><p>Magic Circles were lighting up one after another as people walked in.</p><p><br></p><p>The Glasya-Labolas Magic Circle appeared and Tobio came out and walked up to me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Armin’s not here?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“He was called back by his father after he delivered the goods and will be accompanying them. He sent me to see if you had anything you wanted help with.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No. Nothing here. You can hang out with my peerage members and just keep an eye out for things.”</p><p><br></p><p>The Press was having a field day today but they maintained their distance.</p><p><br></p><p>After around twenty minutes, a crimson Magic Circle lit up the whole area and Sirzechs came out followed by the other three Satans.</p><p><br></p><p>The crowd parted as they walked up to me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Congratulations Mathias. It looks like the preparations have gone well.” Sirzechs shook my hands as he congratulated me.</p><p><br></p><p>We had to pose for the press to click pictures.</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously. I can’t wait for the main party.” Serafall said excitedly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. The preparations are all great. I promise that you will enjoy the party today.”</p><p><br></p><p>I led them in.</p><p><br></p><p>My peerage members will take care of welcoming others with Uncle.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, how are things really coming along? Did you get any messages, invitations, proposals… death threats?” Euclid asked as we were out of the eyes of the camera.</p><p><br></p><p>“No idea.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Was too busy. I will have to get to that can of worms later. Latia had arranged for them to be stored somewhere until we could check them for curses and stuff. She said there were hundreds of them… It hasn’t even been a full day since the entire Rating game fiasco. How in the world did these people get so much time to send me these letters.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh they were probably already prepared with the letters since your name came out on your birthday and were waiting to see things with their own eyes in the Rating Games before sending them in.” He chuckled at my incredulous look.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are underestimating these people too much, Matty. The first thing to learn when doing politics is… being shameless.” Serafall advised, making me turn towards her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Shameless?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously. Most of them hate each other and would love for nothing more than to see them fall but they still work with each other for the sake of profits. You don’t have to like someone to do business with them.” She shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the other three who were quiet and Sirzechs shrugged too. “I sometimes wish I could throw a ball of destruction at Lucifer Castle and go out for a holiday.”</p><p><br></p><p>“They are annoying.” Ajuka added in his two cents which was already too much.</p><p><br></p><p>As for the last one. “Too troublesome.”</p><p><br></p><p>We came to the venue and they took a seat on a table at the front.</p><p><br></p><p>Ajuka looked at the empty tables and raised an eyebrow. “You have places for the Extinct Houses too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Extinct or not, they are all Pillar Houses and have contributed to the Underworld. I don’t see why they shouldn’t get their own places.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Some people would be making noise.” Euclid commented.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well too bad for them it’s not their party.” I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>The Buné and Zagan were treated the same way all this time and I was not going to forget this as soon as I got into a comfortable position.</p><p><br></p><p>“I personally think this is a good idea.” Sirzechs supported.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>While we were talking the other guests had started arriving as well and I left to attend to them.</p><p><br></p><p>Armin and my allies came a bit later as they had to look over the opening of the shops in the other cities.</p><p><br></p><p>The Satan families appeared a while later and at the head of the Gremory Family was Runeas Gremory with someone I wasn’t expecting to see in a while.</p><p><br></p><p>The redhead skipped up to me happily. “Matty! Throwing a lot of parties, I see. Well good job. I like it when things are livelier. Not like Mr. Grumpy here.” She pointed towards Zekram Bael who was slowly approaching us.</p><p><br></p><p>“Lady Runeas….” I started to speak but she cut me off.</p><p><br></p><p>“Runi.” She then came to me and whispered. “I am planning to play some pranks on some kids. Just play along.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded and gave her a thumbs up and even patted her head.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then enjoy the party, Runi.”</p><p><br></p><p>She rolled her eyes for a fleeting moment.</p><p><br></p><p>“Still playing around, sigh.” Zekram spoke as he reached us.</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously, I am not an old grandpa after all.” She stuck out her tongue and made a face at the old man.</p><p><br></p><p>I bowed lightly, “Lord Zekram.”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded and then stared at me for a while.</p><p><br></p><p>“Congratulations on ascending to your Lordships. Unlike what some people would believe”, He threw a look at Sirzechs who had walked up to us seeing Zekram approaching me. “I do feel happy when the houses of my siblings become active.” He said while looking at the tables with the names of the Extinct Pillars on them. The voice was not loud but enough for both us and Sirzechs to hear.</p><p><br></p><p>The old man wasn’t bothered though and shook his head. “This business.” He looked around the building. “Of yours….will bring great changes to the Underworld….changes which will decide the direction our race takes from here on out. I just hope you will be careful to not harm the Underworld in any way.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That has never been my intention. This place is my home and I sincerely wish to improve the lives of people in the Underworld.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh.” He looked at Runeas. “You were right. He’s far different from Zagan. I guess the Buné part of him balances things.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the two and raised an eyebrow.</p><p><br></p><p>“Zagan always kept himself shut in his lab and had to be dragged out even for the most important meetings unless ordered by Lucifer himself. Him opening a business like this would have been impossible. Any businesses the Zagan had were opened and managed by their son.” Runeas explained.</p><p><br></p><p>I just looked at the two with a slightly open mouth while adding hikikomori to my list of things which the original Zagan was.</p><p><br></p><p>“Anyways, come over for a tea sometimes. I heard that Sairaorg stays with you most of the time. Let us show you the hospitality of the Bael.”</p><p><br></p><p>I bowed. “I would be honoured.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hey, would there be any good desserts today?” Runeas asked, excitedly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Desserts? Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I have heard that you are planning to sell some rare alcohol at this place. I look forward to it.” Zekram asked with a glint in his eyes</p><p><br></p><p>“You will not be disappointed.” I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, I have to bring out my best wine.</p><p><br></p><p>They went back to their seats and I looked around.</p><p><br></p><p>Most of the guests had arrived and to my surprise, even the extinct house tables had several of them who were looking around nervously.</p><p><br></p><p>Today’s events had to be taken care of by me alone to show that I was not being controlled by the Gremory and the Astaroth apparently so I couldn’t count on them helping me out today.</p><p><br></p><p>Lavinia was watching over Gasper and Valerie and Shizuka and Natsume were taking care of other things so I asked Ingvild to come with me.</p><p><br></p><p>Ingvild followed me to every table as I welcomed them personally, even the Extinct Houses and Extra Demons were treated the same.</p><p><br></p><p>“You look as if you are serving some kind of punishment.” Leila rolled her eyes when we reached her table.</p><p><br></p><p>The Astaroth family was sitting on one table which meant she, her husband and Latia as well as Lady and Lord Astaorth. It seems they had left their prick of a son back at home. Good.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do I? And here I thought I was hiding it perfectly.” I smiled, causing her to shake her head with a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>“Your disguise skills still need some work, I suppose.”</p><p><br></p><p>“As you say, teacher.” I chuckled before turning towards Lord Astaroth who actually looked… dare I say tense and greeted. “Welcome to my humble place, Lady and Lord Astaorth.” I bowed.</p><p><br></p><p>“N-no. It was expected. You are Leila’s student and engaged to my grand niece Latia. At this point, you are practically family.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you. I hope you will enjoy today’s party.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously. And once more, congratulations Lord Buné Zagan.”</p><p><br></p><p>The Gremory family was sitting with just family.</p><p><br></p><p>I noticed that Runeas and Zekram had taken seats a bit away from the rest of the Pillars, with just the two of them.</p><p><br></p><p>Lord Bael looked more… hmm… what’s the word for it… <em>contained</em>. Perhaps due to the presence of his Ancestor.</p><p><br></p><p>He was accompanied by his wife… not Sai’s mother but someone else and his other son who looked like he wanted to talk to me but kept quiet seeing his father’s stern countenance.</p><p><br></p><p>With all the formalities done, I took the stage.</p><p><br></p><p>“I would like to welcome everyone to the opening of my hotel, my first business in the Underworld and thank you all for being a part of it.”</p><p><br></p><p>There were several people from the press at the back of the room and this scene was being played outside the hotel. In fact, this same thing was being played at all the other Satan cities and the peerage members of the Satans were actually watching over the ceremonies.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am sure most of you have already heard of this but for those of you who haven’t, let me repeat again. I plan to sell the special food products made by me. These products have different effects like increasing the physical and magical growth and even increasing the affinity and resistance to certain elements.”</p><p><br></p><p>Whispers ran throughout the place as I continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“My products are divided into several ranks, starting from F- to B+. Each of these Ranks is for a different level of strength, F being Low Class, E, Middle Class, D High Class, C Ultimate Class and finally B for the Satan Class beings.” I waved my hand and the waiters distributed brochures containing information about various products to every table.</p><p><br></p><p>“Some of these products can have other utilities apart from increasing strength as well. For example, a special type of berries called the Cuticle Berry in my shops can help increase hair growth as well as make hair quality better and Blood Berry which can serve as an alternative for blood.”</p><p><br></p><p>They looked over the list as I explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“But the best selling point of the products is without a doubt… their taste.” I looked at the people gathered in front of me. “I can bet you that by the end of the year, you will be buying my products not for their effects… but for their tastes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Anyways, let’s get back to the explanations. First of all, let me clear out some misconceptions for everyone. My products will give a gradual boost to people if they eat it for a long time. That said, if they truly want to receive the best effects, they need to train and push their body and magic to the fullest. This can assure them a several times higher training speed than normal.”</p><p><br></p><p>I paused and let them digest the information.</p><p><br></p><p>“Second, the ideal food for someone would be the ones closest to their strength level. And yes, I mean strength level. So a kid from a Pillar family will have to eat F or E Class Products and not D Class because they are High Class by Rank. If they do so, they will only be wasting most of the nutritious properties and effects of the food items. Similarly if someone is an Ultimate Class by strength, they will need to eat C Ranked products for the best effects. There won’t be any danger if they do eat a higher ranked product or anything but I would like to think no one would waste the effects of such expensive products. A shout out to the reincarnated devils and other races living in the Underworld, people of other races can eat these food products too and receive the same advantages, so do try.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked around the hall and saw the people discussing and let them calm down a bit before speaking again. I think I heard several discussions from the pillar side about the decision of allowing Reincarnated Devils and other races access to these things but paid them no mind.</p><p><br></p><p>“F to D Ranked products can be sold to anyone without any restriction. C Ranked Products are harder to grow and are in a shorter supply so they need to be ordered in advance. Finally, B Ranked Products are extremely rare and in extremely short supply and will thus be auctioned. I mean you need to understand, these are things which can even affect the powers of the Satans. Such things cannot be sold willy nilly.”</p><p><br></p><p>The noise in the venue grew instantly at the announcement.</p><p><br></p><p>I waited for them to get it out of their systems before clapping and attracting their attention.</p><p><br></p><p>“Now let’s get to the last and main part of today’s event. Where would all these items be sold? Well, my products are currently only being sold in the Satan cities in the branches of Hotel Gourmet run by the Zagan House. Each of these hotels have similar layouts so I will explain it for everyone.”</p><p><br></p><p>I pulled open the curtain behind me and revealed the layout of the Hotel. “The first four floors will contain shops with Unranked to D Ranked Products. Above that will be the place where you can place your orders for C Ranked Products.”</p><p><br></p><p>The press people were noting everything down while the rest were looking into their brochures as I explained along.</p><p><br></p><p>“The four floors above that are the Restaurants which serve the delicacies made from our products. They are divided into Low Class, Middle Class and High Class and need devils to be of the rank or be accompanied by people of said rank to enter. The eighth floor will be a VIP Floor. The ninth floor would be a bar.” I pointed to the floor and threw a glance at Zekram.</p><p><br></p><p>“Finally, the tenth floor, the place where we all are gathered right now, is the auction hall. This is where auctions for B Ranked Products will be held. For auctions, a public notification will be given a month prior to the auction date. Every house will be given a seat for the auction and as these products are a bit sensitive, only those who pass the security and identification tests will be given access to the auctions. For these cases, the decision made by Hotel Gourmet will be final and no arguments will be entertained.”</p><p><br></p><p>Looking at the crowd busy in their discussions, I waited for a minute before speaking. “Any questions?”</p><p><br></p><p>And boy did they have questions.</p><p><br></p><p>Several people raised their hands.</p><p><br></p><p>Surprisingly, the first questions came from the Press side and no one from the Pillars raised any hands.</p><p><br></p><p>They are the ones who are behind the Press.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. The one in purple.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man stood up and bowed. “Many congratulations for opening such a grand establishment, Lord Buné Zagan. I am sure this will be great addition to the culture and power of the Underworld”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded and waited for the man to come out with the actual dirt.</p><p><br></p><p>Leila has taught me that when someone praises me too much on such occasions, they are probably going to be throwing a lot of dirt on me.</p><p><br></p><p>And it did come.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s just that what you said about your products, such things….are completely unheard of. So you can understand if people are a bit….hesitant in trying these products.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And their worries are understandable. I had already anticipated such cases and made a joint effort with the Research and Development Department to have each and every one of the products tested before bringing them to the market. The reports have already been made public and people can procure them from any of our stores or from the DevilNet. You don’t think the Satans would allow such products in the underworld without even verifying the effects, do you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah….that’s….reassuring to hear.” I waited.</p><p><br></p><p>Surely they knew this fact wouldn’t do anything, then what.</p><p><br></p><p>“Still, there is a chance that all products may not be as effective or may lose their effects later on.”</p><p><br></p><p>I stopped him with a raised hand. “All the products for the said tests were picked up at random from my farm and each and every test gave the same results.”</p><p><br></p><p>I observed him closely and saw his lips twitching.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s good to hear but many people would still like to know if there will be any procedures if they do not achieve any results from your products.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the man for a second.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously?</p><p><br></p><p>What does he want me to do?</p><p><br></p><p>Refund?</p><p><br></p><p>A simple look over the halls and Senjutsu gave me the idea about the moods of the people from the Piliar Houses, mostly the active ones who were actually anticipating the answer.</p><p><br></p><p>Discrediting the products of their rivals is a simple and extremely effective strategy which has led several businesses to ruin. This is even easier for these people who have control over the media and economy of the Underworld for literally thousands of years.</p><p><br></p><p>Is this their warning?</p><p><br></p><p>Very well then.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Runeas -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“See and you were wondering why Sirzechs was keeping the kid hidden.” She snorted.</p><p><br></p><p>Zekram shrugged. “This is the very basics. He is coming in and taking away their profits. Obviously there would be people who would be opposed to it. You can’t blame them either. And if the kid cannot even face these small tactics then he has a long way to go.”</p><p><br></p><p>They looked at the kid who stared at the reporter for a second and then turned towards the Pillar Houses. “This is a very reasonable doubt for anyone to have. Do any of the Pillars of the Extra Demon Houses have the same doubts?”</p><p><br></p><p>The Pillars were taken aback at the sudden question but collected themselves quickly and one of them, Shax, got up and replied. “The Shax house has been one of the leading distributors of food products for the entire Underworld and in our branch of trade, the quality of the product is always a matter of concern.”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy nodded and then turned towards the rest.</p><p><br></p><p>One by one several houses stood up.</p><p><br></p><p>Zekram had probably already made it clear to not directly get involved in any moves against the boy, seeing as the kid from the Bael house was not among the ones standing. He probably wanted to see what the kid was made up of before deciding any stance.</p><p><br></p><p>All of them waited for his answer.</p><p><br></p><p>When no one stood up, Mathias looked back at the reporter.</p><p><br></p><p>“As I was saying, I can understand the doubts of people, especially the Low Class and Middle Class individuals. In that case, let me explain a few things about selling the products. First, every individual or family will be allowed to buy only a certain amount of my products every month. This will be done by issuing everyone of them with a card connected to their official id to keep a record. There are several reasons for this. First, till now, I haven’t been able to expand my farm freely due to my need to hide it. Second, we do not want people to hoard and resell them outside.”</p><p><br></p><p>She watched as several people’s faces turned into a frown, especially the houses which had stood up.</p><p><br></p><p>The kid didn’t stop though </p><p><br></p><p>“Third, when the business expands, it will make contracts with the owners of the territories to operate shops there. The contracts will include several things like the prices at which the products will be sold in those territories and stuff. Now, if someone has any problems regarding the effects of the products, which I had already explained, will not be instant, they can take it up with the Lords of the said territories. They can investigate and if they find that the fault is from our side, provide us with adequate evidence and I will do the required.”</p><p><br></p><p>She raised an eyebrow.</p><p><br></p><p>The reporter was not expecting this kind of reply and asked further.</p><p><br></p><p>“May I enquire what kind of step you will take?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Of course. I will compensate for any purchases made in that month.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And there he fell for the trap.” Zekram sighed. “He still needs to learn more.”</p><p><br></p><p>She had however heard a lot about him from both Venelana and Zeo so she kept listening.</p><p><br></p><p>It was just not like anything she had heard.</p><p><br></p><p>And sure enough he continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“And then I will ban their cards….forever. They will not be allowed to purchase my products from then on.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>There was a moment of quiet in the house before the entire place burst into a cacophony of noises.</p><p><br></p><p>No one was expecting this kind of answer.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh I am very serious.” A smile formed on his face. “I am not exactly a businessman. All I want to do is sell good products to the people of the Underworld and share my talents with them but if they are not satisfied with the quality of my products even after the reassurances and certifications of the Research and Development itself….then I’d rather not sell to them.”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy turned towards the Pillars who had stood up. “In fact since all of you do have doubts, I will have my people recheck the quality of the lots I send to your territories a few more times to prevent such things but as you know….such procedures will take extra expenses on my end so I apologise for the increased prices. As you know….I never compromise with the quality of my products. Hmm….actually, since this is the first time, let’s make a fifteen year period for these extra checks. After that if you gain enough trust in the quality of my products, I will remove these checks and the price can go back to normal.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Lord Zagan, you don’t mean….” Shax started speaking but Mathias raised his hand.</p><p><br></p><p>“No no Lord Shax is indeed right. As someone who has been in the food industry for so long, I know you cannot tolerate any compromise with the quality of products and I as a junior have learned a very important lesson from you today….So….so just let me do this.” he turned to the rest of the audience. “Everyone, a hand of applause for Lord Shax for correcting my mistake and guiding me into making these changes.”</p><p><br></p><p>After that no matter who tried to speak or say anything to the kid, he blatantly pretended to be affected by Shax and didn’t budge from his stance.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahahaha see see I told you. He was different.” She elbowed Zekram. “Just look at Shax's face. He looks like he would burst a nerve at any moment.”</p><p><br></p><p>The drama went on as the Pillar Devils all sat down, gritting their teeth and he looked at the reporter again.</p><p><br></p><p>“So….anything else.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man looked completely out of it from the sudden turn of events.</p><p><br></p><p>“Lord Mathias….I mean Lord Buné Zagan….isn’t your decision very hasty. You know this will cost you a lot of business. It probably isn’t the best thing for someone in your position who is starting to raise both his houses from the brink of extinction.” He tried to reason, already sweating from the whole debacle.</p><p><br></p><p>“And what of my houses?” He asked, as she saw a glint of light in his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Your houses will need a lot of investments and capital and moves like this will be extremely disadvantageous for your business. Don’t you think that will be bad for the development of your territories?”</p><p><br></p><p>She scoffed mentally.</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah, as if he would lack money. This was a guy who could grow gemstones on plants.</p><p><br></p><p>Zeo had told her about the actual gold mine he had kept from them in the last tour.</p><p><br></p><p>The kid just chucked at the reporter’s question. “Can I ask you a question, Mr. Reporter?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh….yes?”</p><p><br></p><p>“What was my title….I mean what was my nickname before my full heritage was revealed?”</p><p><br></p><p>The face of many people blanched at his question.</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t know about it either so she looked at the guy beside her. “Do you know?”</p><p><br></p><p>Zekram kept staring at the kid and replied. “The Farmer Noble, Penniless Dragon, Beggar Noble and several others on the same line.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Go on. Tell me. Don’t worry, I won’t be angry.” The boy prodded.</p><p><br></p><p>The reporter sweated more but didn’t answer.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy finally sighed and looked at one of the tables. “Armin, what was I called?”</p><p><br></p><p>All eyes turned towards the Glasya-Labolas table and the heir who could be seen rolling his eyes at the question before replying. “The Beggar Noble,the Peasant Noble, etc.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Exactly!” He clapped. “And have I ever refuted those titles….even in private?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No….none that I recall.”</p><p><br></p><p>Mathias turned towards the reporter but not before throwing a narrowed glance at every pillar who had been standing a moment ago.</p><p><br></p><p>“See….I have been poor since the moment I was born Mr. Reporter. I had nothing….zero.” He spoke as his eyes became serious when facing everyone. “And thus….even if I start getting one Lilith now instead of a hundred….I would still be earning more than I was.”</p><p><br></p><p>And with those words the serious look in his eyes disappeared and an honest smile came to his face. “See, I was never rich….so I don’t mind staying poor for a while longer.”</p><p><br></p><p>The full venue became pin drop silent at this as the boy continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“And while it may take a bit longer to reach there….I know for certain that I will reach there. You see, I am not good at business and I absolutely suck at politics….It’s because I am not a businessman or a politician. I am a farmer. The reason I know I will reach there is because I have absolute confidence in the crops I grow, in the animals I rear, and I’ll be damned….if I let someone question the quality of my life’s work.” He spoke directly to the crowd. “I know many of you have doubts. As I have said, it is normal to have such doubts, but at least try it once and I bet it will be the best thing you will ever taste. You might buy these for the special effects but I can bet my name that you will stay for the taste. This is my….Mathias Buné Zagan’s confidence in my work.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>No one spoke anything and then there was a clap.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked and it was her own descendant. Rias clapped and was soon joined by the Astaroth girl, the Glasya-Labolas boy and even the Bael kid and slowly by many of the houses of his supporters and even the Satans.</p><p><br></p><p>She smiled and clapped and looked at Zekram who snorted a laugh. “I take it back. He is nothing like that shut-in geek. That guy couldn’t speak two sentences in a row, let alone something elaborate like this. He’s a typical Buné, probably the one with the largest pair of balls in history but still a typical Buné.”</p><p><br></p><p>But despite his words, he clapped too.</p><p><br></p><p>The clapping stopped after sometime and he looked at the crowd gathered. “Thank you all. I think this should be enough for the questions. Let’s get to the best part now. Food.” He smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes! Now we are talking.” She yelled, attracting a few eyes but they didn’t stare more than a moment, probably because of Zekram beside her.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Mathias -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I watched as the food was served to the tables by the waitresses.</p><p><br></p><p>The system with the card was something we had planned in advance because we wanted to prevent hoarding.</p><p><br></p><p>The main advantage other houses had over us was their funds.</p><p><br></p><p>They could always buy out goods in large quantities from us and resell them at an even higher price when we are out of stock, completely destroying the goal of providing low priced products for the Low and Middle Class devils.</p><p><br></p><p>A card system will bypass this.</p><p><br></p><p>The reason given for it was not bad either.</p><p><br>We didn’t want to spread the crops to outsiders that soon.</p><p><br></p><p>Right now I don't have the capacity to do so….which was the whole reason for all this over the top acting.</p><p><br></p><p>I still need around five million points to upgrade my Farm Rank and with me selling stuff like this, increasing my farm size, the increased use of fertilisers, feed for my farm animals and providing for the people who enter my territory….I would have next to nothing left to sell to the System for a while.</p><p><br></p><p>That was something which I couldn’t afford to do.</p><p><br></p><p>I needed to Rank Up my Farm to at least A Rank and unlock the limits on my stats before I could relax.</p><p><br></p><p>The biggest reliance in this world is my own power.</p><p><br></p><p>If I am strong, I can have the confidence to face all of their plots without any fear for my safety.</p><p><br></p><p>With this tantrum and increased prices in the territories of a dozen houses, the sales will probably be a bit less at the start.</p><p><br></p><p>But as I said, it will definitely pick up speed as more people find out the effects of the food items. I will get there in time.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean it’s not like I have any fear of my produce going to waste.</p><p><br></p><p>Moreover, the customers I gain like this will have more trust in my products and will be less likely to be swayed by empty rumours.</p><p><br></p><p>The people had already started eating and I could see their expressions. It was working.</p><p><br></p><p>I walked to the balcony to see the crowd outside who were being given free snacks to try by the staff.</p><p><br></p><p>This was suggested by Natsume. She said that the common people could get over their nervousness if they tried some samples for free.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a simple but great idea and I agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>Currently all four hotels are doing the same.</p><p><br></p><p>They give free samples of the snacks to anyone who registers with us to get our card.</p><p><br></p><p>One by one, people were increasing and that’s exactly what I wanted.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>After eating, the Pillars all left to check out the rest of the hotel and to buy things for themselves and we finally got some room to breathe.</p><p><br></p><p>I saw Runeas and Zekram were waiting in a certain corner.</p><p><br></p><p>They hadn’t followed the rest and were staying back to have a talk with me. Incidentally the Satans, at least Sirzechs and Serafall were staying back too.</p><p><br></p><p>Ajuka, Falbium and Euclid went down with the crowd, probably because they have worked on my products and had vouched for it.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ingvild. Call Lavy and bring the Rainbow Fruit Wine and the Emerald Wine.” I told the girl.</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded and contacted Lavy while I approached the group waiting for me.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, did you all enjoy the party? If not then perhaps I could make up for things with some wine from my best collection.” I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“That does sound wonderful.” Serafall smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>Others nodded simply.</p><p><br></p><p>“Great. In that case let me take you to a more….private place.” I led them up to the top floor, to my office.</p><p><br></p><p>Uncle Logan was outside and saw us coming and bowed, opening the door.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone took their seats and just a moment later Ingvild and Lavinia came with the wine, closing the door behind them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ingvild! How have you been? Matty is not bullying you is he? If he is then you can tell me and I will steal you away from him. My offer still stands, you know? You could join my peerage anytime or even become a High Class Devil of your own!”</p><p><br></p><p>My eyes twitched slightly at her blatantly trying to steal my peerage member even when I knew that she was joking.</p><p><br></p><p>I wasn’t bothered by it at first but as the two of us got closer, I was starting to feel more…. possessive maybe I guess.</p><p><br></p><p>“Will you please stop trying to steal my peerage member, Serafall.” I sighed before signalling Lavinia to pour the wine for everyone.</p><p><br></p><p>“B-b-but we suit each other so well. Ingvild even wants to become a singer. She can totally sing in my concerts with me. It would be awesome. Even our names match, you know.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ah….I see. So this was her plan.</p><p><br></p><p>To disclose her identity in front of these two old monsters to prevent any future problems.</p><p><br></p><p>I sensed Ingvild stiffening a bit but relaxed almost instantly.</p><p><br></p><p>Zekram seemed to have caught on while Runeas was still out of it.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at Ingvild and then at Serafall. “Really?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It was a happy coincidence.” Serafall smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>I can see what she meant by being shameless was the key to winning in politics.</p><p><br></p><p>Zekram looked at her and questioned. “What is your name girl?”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at her from the corner of my eyes and gave her a slight nod of my head.</p><p><br></p><p>“My name is Ingvild Leviathan, Sir.” She introduced herself with a bow.</p><p><br></p><p>Runeas finally caught on to the conversation.</p><p><br></p><p>“Leviathan….what is your mother’s name?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ingrid Leviathan.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah the youngest of the Leviathan. I remember her. She was still a kid during the Great War. Very different from that snorty elder sister of hers. Leviathan used to tell me about her sometimes when we drank together. How is she nowadays?”</p><p><br></p><p>“She passed away while I was in a comatose state.” She replied in a sombre tone.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah….I see. Was it during the….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ingrid Leviathan didn’t participate in the Civil War.” Zekram interrupted. “In fact, she was against it and left the underworld and was not heard about….till now. Who is your father, child?” Zekram asked, far more kindly this time.</p><p><br></p><p>“I….my Father was a human.”</p><p><br></p><p>“....I see. Do you know how your mother passed away?” He asked and she shook her head.</p><p><br></p><p>“I had fallen into the Sleeping Sickness and was sent outside for treatment. When I awakened, I was informed that she had passed away.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You woke up from the Sleeping Sickness?” He asked, stunned.</p><p><br></p><p>“She awakened her Sacred Gear and it jolted her awake.” Sirzechs interrupted and explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sacred Gear….half human. I see. So what do you intend to do now?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I….I just want to work for….” She took a look at me and then steeled herself. “I just wish to work for my King and help him achieve his dreams.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Then I wish you best of luck. Having the bloodlines of the Satans is indeed a thing to celebrate.” He nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>I couldn’t resist slightly raising my eyebrow, especially because I didn’t sense any lie from him.</p><p><br></p><p>The man saw this and let out a sigh. “Just what kind of boogeyman do you all think I am? I have no problem with these things. If anything I welcome such additions as it helps restore the previous strength of the Underworld. I have nothing against it as long as it doesn’t become a danger to the Underworld. Having a Satan’s bloodline back with us is a blessing. Even if the kids almost never inherit the Traits of the Satans themselves, just the insane amounts of Demonic Power they possess could grant us another peak Ultimate Class Devil or with some luck even a Satan Class with proper training.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Wait, what do you mean by they don’t inherit their Clan Traits?” Serafall asked and even I was a bit confused.</p><p><br></p><p>“Satan Bloodlines are different from ours, probably due to being demons originally and not created by Lilith and Lucifer. All of them have several times more Demonic Power compared to even other Pillar Clans which put them in a class above any common devil.”</p><p><br></p><p>“There are several other traits to nuances to their bloodlines too like all Leviathan Clan members being born as girls and all Asmodeus being boys.” Runeas added.</p><p><br></p><p>I wanted to reject her theory as the actual Leviathan, the father of Satan Leviathan was actually a guy but then I stopped myself. There could have been changes in the time she was hiding in the pits. Probably something changed in her bloodline after she became a devil which was carried forward.</p><p><br></p><p>Zekram continued. “It is however their Clan Traits which are almost never passed down to their children. The ‘Demonic Brilliance of Evil Light’ of Lucifer, ‘King of Flies’ of the Beelzebub, ‘Starsent Moment’ of the Asmodeus and finally the ‘Sea Serpent of the End’ of the Leviathan. These were powers beyond any Clan Traits of the Pillar Clans bar perhaps my own and….” he threw a look at me. “The Life Magic of the Zagan.”</p><p><br></p><p>This got raised eyebrows from both the Satans present.</p><p><br></p><p>“It was for this reason I was given the title of the Great King of the Underworld and Zagan was considered for the second Great King.” He dropped a bomb.</p><p><br></p><p>“Say what….” I blurted before I understood what was going on. </p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah that actually happened.” Runeas added. “It was actually proposed by Lilith probably because Zagan was her favourite. They were both users of Life Magic after all. Too bad Beelzebub was a prick about the whole thing because Zagan could create hundreds of types of organisms compared to his own bees. Talk about petty. Even Leviathan thought he was being a whiny bastard, told me and Lilith herself when we were drinking. Mom almost never joined our drinking sessions but she was absolutely pissed that day and had drunk Leviathan out of her entire bar.  That day….I learned that the first lady of the Devil race could swear bad enough to make angels bleed in the ears.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Zagan himself was actually happy that he wasn’t dragged into even more work and could spend more time in his lab. Seriously….sigh. I never understood that guy’s mind.” Zekram added as he picked up his glass of wine and took a sip. “Oh, this is indeed fine.”</p><p><br></p><p>All of us were listening to stories no one had any idea about.</p><p><br></p><p>“Coming back to the topic, those clan traits were almost never inherited by their children. Even Rizevim, despite his insane power didn’t inherit his father’s power so he created a magic of his own, his so-called Sacred Gear Canceller.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Really?! I thought that was a power unique to him?” Sirzechs said, surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nope. Now you see why these traits are so rare.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But….Ingvild did inherit her grandmother’s trait.” Serafall interrupted, making both of the older devils turn towards her, surprised. “And not only that, she is already a Satan Class Devil in terms of Demonic Power even when she was asleep for the last one hundred years. She’s a genius, isn’t she?”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s….indeed very rare.” Runeas nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl was apparently too embarrassed by all the attention on her so she looked at her feet.</p><p><br></p><p>“All the better for the Underworld.” Zekram spoke. “But let’s come to the main topic for today.” He looked at me.</p><p><br></p><p>Let’s see what he wanted to say.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Armin -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“What do you recommend, Armin?” His mother asked as she looked around the place for what to buy.</p><p><br></p><p>Matty had offered him and his family his permission to directly get anything they wanted from his farm without any of this card business and he too preferred it that way but today was different.</p><p><br></p><p>Today they were here to promote his products in front of the whole underworld so he brought his mother, Lisbell and Lilitifa to buy things.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Euclid had followed them with his own family while his brother and Satan Beelzebub were answering questions about the safety tests done with the products to any who had doubts.</p><p><br></p><p>They were currently on the fourth floor with D Ranked products.</p><p><br></p><p>He personally needed C Ranked products but he could directly order it from the farm. Despite Matty’s offer, he didn’t want his friend to be at a loss.</p><p><br></p><p>These products were mostly for Lisbell and Lilitifa.</p><p><br></p><p>“I would recommend the fruits. Blue Hawaiiokan, Mirror Lychee and Saphialmond would be a good choice.” He showed them the items and they placed orders.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my, these things look like pure Sapphires. How pretty. Can we really eat these?” His mother asked, looking at the Saphialmonds.</p><p><br></p><p>Several people were watching them to see what they did so he picked up one of the almonds and took a bite in front of the whole crowd.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, obviously. These ones are my favourites. Actually I think you should get the Perfect Beauty Cattle meat and Smooth Skin Bean Sprouts. These two things are extremely good for the skin and body and will be out soon once people find out about it.” He advised while making sure his voice was heard by others around him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is that true, Euclid?” The man’s wife asked him on hearing his explanation.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well yes. We did confirm it.”</p><p><br></p><p>And apparently that was all that was needed.</p><p><br></p><p>A crowd of ladies rushed towards the counters, leaving the men behind.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will never understand this. Can’t they use Demonic Power to retain their youth?” He asked Euclid.</p><p><br></p><p>The man just gave him a smile and patted his shoulder. “You have a lot to learn, Armin. A lot to learn.”</p><p><br></p><p>….that explained nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>He walked around to the other floors to check if there were any troubles and was approached by several reporters.</p><p><br></p><p>Today however, he didn’t run away and faced them head on.</p><p><br></p><p>“Heir Glasya-Labolas, how do you feel about these products?”</p><p><br></p><p>“You have been a friend of Lord Buné Zagan for a long time. What can you tell us about him?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you think his claims are true?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Can his products really do what he says?”</p><p><br></p><p>“When will we see you in another Rating Game?”</p><p><br></p><p>“There are rumours that you have been undergoing some kind of secret training from Lord Asmodeus in this time that you were away. Is it true?”</p><p><br></p><p>Say what?</p><p><br></p><p>“Kyaa~ Armin, marry me.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>And then there were such people.</p><p><br></p><p>He let out an internal sigh as he got ready to answer their questions.</p><p><br></p><p>Matty better appreciate this.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. I haven’t been getting any special training from Lord Asmodeus. I just have been spending more time gathering a good enough peerage and training them. I can’t win all the Rating Games alone, can I?” He answered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Mathias and I have been good friends for a long time. He is one of the most dedicated and talented people I have had the fortune of meeting and knowing.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Also yes, Mathias’ products are indeed just as he claims. I….personally have tried them and can attest to their effectiveness.” He accepted.</p><p><br></p><p>And with it the press grew even louder.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you saying that the secret behind your strength are the Special Zagan Food Items?” Several of them asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“My growth in power in these last few years is almost inseparable from these products. But I want to remind everyone again that these products only give the best results when the people push their body to their limits. Please always remember it. While they do provide an increase in even natural growth, it would be nothing compared to truly pushing yourself and training hard.”</p><p><br></p><p>With his admission, the crowd went wild and the sales increased almost instantly.</p><p><br></p><p>He just hoped things went on smoothly for the rest of the day too.</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><strong>I finally completed this.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>It was turning out to be far longer than I was planning it to be so I had to cut a scene and change it with another or I would have had to leave it in the middle of a scene.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Still, Matty’s products are out for sale.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Till now, it was just his claims but now the products will be out and other factions will be able to test and verify its results.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>How will they react?</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>What will the other houses do?</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>What does Zekram want to talk to Mathias about?</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>And what is going on with the rest of the world.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The fun part is finally starting.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>We will see everything in the next chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Damn….now I want to write another chapter of this one instead of ‘The Deal’.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br><br><br><br></p>",

How did I do?” I asked them.</p><p><br></p><p>“It was good. At least with the reveal of your special products, people inside the council will think twice before being too hard on you in fear of pushing you away. It should reduce your load a bit.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ughh… I still have that, don’t I? Maybe I should have let Riser punch me a bit and then pretend to be injured and not attend the council gathering.” I moaned.</p><p><br></p><p>“He would have broken his hand.” Armin rolled his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry. Father and the other people of the alliance will all support you. You just need to make your presence and leave. After that, there is no need to attend all the meetings. Only appearing once every year will be necessary. By then we can easily consolidate our position.” Rias said.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at her surprised. She knew politics?</p><p><br></p><p>The girl blushed and explained. “I have been taking classes from Mother on politics to help the Buné and Zagan Houses in the future.”</p><p><br></p><p>A smile appeared on my face and I hugged her lightly. “Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t need to thank me. It’s going to be my family too.” </p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, I will handle the gathering.”</p><p><br></p><p>It was just a gathering of old coots. How bad could it be?</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>Kill me.</p><p><br></p><p>This is annoying as fuck.</p><p><br></p><p>“Bored already?” Zeoticus asked me.</p><p><br></p><p>“More than you can think. How can people babble so much about stupid inconsequential things for hours straight with such confidence and pride? This was supposed to be a general meeting to discuss the events of this year and the effect it would have on the Devil Race, right?”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s what it is supposed to be?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then how did this change into a discussion about the next Annual Pillar Gathering and even if it did, then why is it taking this much time? Just recommend a few people and make a committee and throw the responsibility for organisation on them and concentrate on the more important topics. I don’t believe that a New Year party is the most important topic of discussion in the whole Underworld.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha this is the way things work here. As long as something doesn’t endanger the Underworld, people here rarely concentrate on serious topics. There is more than one reason for it.” Euclid explained.</p><p><br></p><p>He was also the Head of the Lucifuge House, one of the only three houses among the Extra Demons to have joined the Current Government along with Mephistopheles and the Mamon House. This allowed him the privilege to attend and even vote in the council meetings. Apart from the House Heads, the Ultimate Class Devils were also given a vote each when passing laws.</p><p><br></p><p>It was one of the reasons why the Rating Games and the Top Ten Players were so important. It was because all of them were Ultimate Class. This was also a reason why it wasn’t so easy to become an Ultimate Class just by having Ultimate Class Strength.</p><p><br></p><p>“What reasons?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Devils are a long lived race. Especially the older devils who are thousands of years old. Their way of perceiving time is different from the young ones.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at him incredulously.</p><p><br></p><p>“Things change when you live that long.” He shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sometimes I wonder if these people stopped boasting so much and put this time into actually discussing how to do good for the underworld… the devil race would have been far better by now. I mean it’s not that much time either. Just a few hours.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh just you wait till it’s time to discuss business. These same people will become hell hounds fighting for a piece of meat.” Zeoticus whispered while still smiling towards the crowd. “In fact, you will get to experience it today as well.”</p><p><br></p><p>I sighed.</p><p><br></p><p>So troublesome.</p><p><br></p><p>The moment came surely enough.</p><p><br></p><p>I heard my name being called out and looked forward.</p><p><br></p><p>A guy, Victus Uvall, a member of the Great King faction and one of the lackeys of Lord Bael who had come with him back then to invite me to their faction.</p><p><br></p><p>“My congratulations on ascending to your position as the Lord of Zagan and Buné houses. We are all excited to have two reputable names with us once more.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t need my rank of Senjutsu to know that he felt nothing of what he was saying.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you. I look forward to working towards the betterment of the Devil Race with everyone.” I smiled my best fake smile.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, I should have gained a skill for fake smiling with the amount of times I had practised this.</p><p><br></p><p>“Indeed. This is a very joyful occasion for our race and I am sure that we would be seeing a very rapid growth in the Devil race soon but….your news of ascension or even the existence of a Zagan descendant came as a surprise. I have heard that the Satans had chosen to keep your existence a secret to protect you from people who would target you for your Zagan heritage. But… was this really necessary? The Devil Race is far stronger than the Fallen Angels and the Angels right now. Don’t you think that the Satans had overreacted a little?”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Euclid beside me and gave him a look as if asking if this guy was an idiot?</p><p><br></p><p>Is this the kind of stupidity I have to deal with all day?</p><p><br></p><p>Since they were being this dumb, I decided to treat them the same way.</p><p><br></p><p>“No.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>They waited for me to continue but I didn’t.</p><p><br></p><p>After a few more moments of silence, the guy looked at me awkwardly. “Excuse me?”</p><p><br></p><p>“You asked me a question and I gave you the answer.” I shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>I could feel him trying to control his lips from twitching.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is that all? Do you have nothing more to add?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>I stared back at the guy and seeing that he didn’t give up, I decided to be a bit more straightforward. I picked up a glass and showed it to him.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is this Lord Uvall?”</p><p><br></p><p>The guy stared at me, confused so I showed him the glass again.</p><p><br></p><p>“A glass full of water.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Is that all? Nothing more to add?”</p><p><br></p><p>The guy’s face flushed.</p><p><br></p><p>“When the answer to someone’s question is obvious, even a single word can suffice as an answer. The Zagan House was specifically hunted by the other two factions even after the Great War had ended till there were almost no members left alive… publicly at least. The Satans had considered this offered me a choice and I chose to keep my identity hidden. Why is that so hard to believe? Or are you saying that I should have bet the continued existence of my houses on an ‘if’?”</p><p><br></p><p>A hint of rage appeared on his face at my answer but he quickly hid it away.</p><p><br></p><p>“I apologise for being insensitive, Lord Zagan. What I was saying was that we all, the entire Devil race would have lent a hand to protect such an important member of our race if only we knew. You could have also gained access to more people than you did. Was it really worth it, being confined all this time in a small place?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t give them any chance to pressure me. If they gain a footing then they will drag the talks too much.</p><p><br></p><p>Looking at the annoyed face of the man before me I let out an internal smirk.</p><p><br></p><p>“You seem to have some more questions, Lord Uvall.” I asked this time, taking the initiative.</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t know what kind of life you have experienced but it is kinda sad to see that you don’t trust the abilities of our race to protect you and your house. I wonder what happened to you to have so low trust in the Underworld.” He shrugged disappointedly.</p><p><br></p><p>I narrowed my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Trying to turn the public against me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Stop twisting the meaning of his words, Lord Uvall.” Zeoticus started to speak but I shook my head towards him, making him stop.</p><p><br></p><p>Since they are trying to pick a fight against me, it wouldn’t be good to hide behind my allies.</p><p><br></p><p>Leila had warned me of their tactics.</p><p><br></p><p>A few of them will apply pressure on me while their leaders will pretend to offer a hand. If I accept them, they can set the rules of the alliance since I would be on the backfoot.</p><p><br></p><p>This is exactly why I hated politics.</p><p><br></p><p>But… it didn’t mean I would let anyone bully me.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are correct Lord Uvall. I have very low trust in the capabilities of the one you mentioned to protect me.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>That gained the attention of everyone in the place.</p><p><br></p><p>“Matty…” Euclid tried to speak but I raised a hand and stopped him.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see that you still don’t understand  the situation. Seriously, you should go and read on the topic a bit before you speak and waste the time of the entire council. But since things have come to this point, let me clearly enlighten you, not with some baseless words but rather concrete facts.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man who certainly wasn’t expecting this kind of reply and was taken aback for a while.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eighty five members of the Zagan House have been assassinated <em>inside</em> the Underworld, in the so-called protection that you are flaunting about.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But that was during the Great War. Times are different now. Surely…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Again, I really wish you would do some research on something before wasting my time. Only thirty eight members among those had been killed during the Great War. A fun fact was that most of them were due to misinformation. And before you say anything, I have the records of each and every killing in detail. In fact, these records are even present in the Lucifer Archives at New Lilith in case anyone wants to read them. You should probably go there and read them and then try to question me about this stupid topic.”</p><p><br></p><p>He opened his mouth but before he could say anything, I continued, not giving him a chance to speak.</p><p><br></p><p>“You say that the entire Underworld would have protected me and my house, correct?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded. “I am sure….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then where were they when over forty of my family members were killed? I am sure that after some time everyone would have realised that the other factions were targeting my house, so why didn’t anyone try to protect them?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Those were tough times. Everyone was recuperating after the war and there was also rising tensions due to the descendants of the previous Satans wanting to restart the Great War.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And that’s the first reason. If a situation arises where they had to choose, they would choose their own protection over mine. It’s a fact that my mother survived for so long by keeping her identity a secret. I decided to do the same for my own protection. The only reason she was even killed was due to a coincidence….by one of the people you say would protect me. I don’t see why people are making so much noise regarding this simple fact.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Not everyone is like that.”</p><p><br></p><p>“True, but… I couldn’t risk even one more person being like that. You keep on forgetting that this was the last chance for my house.”</p><p><br></p><p>That made them quiet.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, it seems that you are starting to understand things now. In that case let me ask you a question in return since you are so concerned about my mental and social well being.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes?”</p><p><br></p><p>“When my parents were killed, I sent an invitation to all of the Pillars. Some responded personally, while some sent servants. As far as I recall, your house didn’t even respond to the invitation. Why is that so?”</p><p><br></p><p>The man’s face flushed. “I’m sorry for not being able to offer my condolences but I was…”</p><p><br></p><p>“At New Lilith organising an Art Exhibition.” I interrupted, making him clamp his mouth shut.</p><p><br></p><p>“Matty…” Euclid tried to stop me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Just a moment, Euclid. If I don’t stop this nons… I mean if I don’t clear Lord Uvall’s doubts then everyone will think I am easy to bull… I mean will have doubts. It’s better to take care of things once and for all. I don’t mind questions as long as the other side has done <em>sincere</em> investigations and has actual doubts but I have zero tolerance for people who waste my time with such useless questions.” I turned back to the guy who was completely quiet now.</p><p><br></p><p>“My apologies for the interruptions. So, I see that organising an Art exhibition was more important for you than attending the funeral of one of the Pillar Heads. With examples like this… how do you expect me to trust the people with these kinds of priorities to protect me during times of danger? I am sure you understand how assassinations are done? The assassins don’t announce that they are going to attack someone in advance.”</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing no reply, I continued. “I am very grateful to the current Satans for giving me the necessary protection and agreeing to my request to keep my status a secret until the time that I felt I was ready to rise up to my responsibilities. As for the ones I came into contact with, it was done by me of my own violation. In fact, as stated in the interview, I revealed my identity to anyone who talked civilly with me for a month. How do you expect me to trust people who didn’t even talk to the heir of an endangered house like the Buné, to protect me in times of danger?” I looked around and there were many types of reactions.</p><p><br></p><p>Some people avoided my eyes while some other people glared at me for pointing this out and more or less slapping them right in the face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Does anyone have any questions?”</p><p><br></p><p>No questions came.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Euclid -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Damn… this was what he was worrying about.</p><p><br></p><p>They pushed Matty and he snapped back at them.</p><p><br></p><p>None of them would have expected to encounter such a person.</p><p><br></p><p>As expected none of them questioned him next and turned their attention towards Sirzechs next.</p><p><br></p><p>He quickly used a small barrier to isolate them from others.</p><p><br></p><p>“Was it really alright to do that Matty?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It was. I know what they were doing, however I don't care. The thing I wanted is done already. Now, even if those idiots invited me, I can just pretend to be irritated by Uvall and deny. After all, I am just a hot blooded eighteen year old with more power than they think I’m worthy of. This kind of behaviour was to be expected.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“You were hoping for this?” Euclid looked at me incredulously.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yup.”</p><p><br></p><p>“For the next few years, I will have no time to worry about them. As long as I get this time, I will be able to stabilise my territories and then get back to this.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But won’t they create more trouble for you?” He asked. “It will take out more time from your already busy schedule.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That might not necessarily be the case.” Lord Gremory sitting beside him spoke.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the man for explanation and he explained. “Mathias has something which their previous targets didn’t have.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What thing?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Monopoly. Mathias has a complete monopoly on products which is going to become nigh compulsory for the development of any house in a few years time. They could hate him all they want but they <em>will</em> have to trade with him on his own terms once his business is established.”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the boy who was looking forward with a stoic look on his face. “Is that what you were counting on, Matty?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Among other things,” he answered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! What other things are you targeting?” Lord Gremory asked curiously.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked towards them. “What is the best they can do to hinder my business?” he asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, they might stop the sales of the products in their territories, cutting into your profits. They might spread false rumours to reduce the credibility of your products.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Spreading false rumours will not work in the long term as long as the ones in the territories of my allies are not affected. Moreover, I have the certifications of the Research and Development Department. It will be very hard to directly say that my products are faulty. As for cutting the sales in their territories. That’s exactly what I want.”</p><p><br></p><p>Lord Gremory raised an eyebrow.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tell me Lord Gremo…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Call me Father.” the guy interrupted and Euclid rolled his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“... father, tell me, if you were a Low or Middle Class Devil living in their territory and you saw that the Devils of the same class in other territories were getting stronger after eating my food while you were not even getting access to it or if you could then at an extremely inflated price through some underground channels, then what would you do?”</p><p><br></p><p>“...I…” The man was about to speak but paused and looked at him in stunned silence. Euclid did the same too.</p><p><br></p><p>“You were targeting their people from the very start. You want them to cut off the sales so that the people in their territories migrate to yours.” Euclid asked, stunned.</p><p><br></p><p>He shrugged. “I need people to come to my territory and these people will have to come from somewhere.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s… very cunning of you Matty.” He looked at the usually straightforward guy as if seeing him for the first time. That was ruthless.</p><p><br></p><p>“It wasn’t my original plan. This plan was actually made due to an idea from Rias. She wanted to think of a way we could rob the people from the territories of the people who had commented badly about my Rating Game and it struck a chord with us. Later on, all three of us, Rias, Latia and I planned this. Things will obviously not be so easy but there will certainly be some effects. And that will not be the end either.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously. To stop the outflow of population, they will have to agree to your terms of trade no matter how ridiculous. That’s indeed ruthless. Just what is Venelana teaching the girl?” Lord Gremory shook his head but it was easy to notice the smile on his face.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously?</p><p><br></p><p>As if that blackhearted businesswoman wasn’t enough. Now even the other finance was becoming a blackhearted politician.</p><p><br></p><p>Did Mathias have an affinity for these types?</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs and Serafall managed to keep them in control.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally the main topic came.</p><p><br></p><p>“I would like to ask Lord Buné Zagan a question.” Lord Amy stood up and asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Mathias looked at him and nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have heard about what you said about your farm products and their effects. I would like to confirm if they are true once more.” he asked.</p><p><br></p><p>And sure enough the attention of the entire council turned towards Mathias.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Every word I said is true. The products were tested and their results were verified by the Devil Research and Development Department and they have been certified as well.” He answered.</p><p><br></p><p>Euclid took this chance to stand up and verify the statement.</p><p><br></p><p>“Over the last three years, both Satan Beelzebub and myself have worked on all these products and verified their effects.”</p><p><br></p><p>Falbium also took this chance to throw in his own words. “It’s true. I tested the effect of those things on a squad of my soldiers as well. They are completely safe and have the stated effects. The Defense Department is currently discussing a deal for a stable supply of these grains for our Military as well.”</p><p><br></p><p>He saw the expressions of the people change all over the hall.</p><p><br></p><p>The Amy Devil also had various emotions circle his face before controlling them quickly. “That is indeed great news for the Devil Race. I would like to thank Lord Buné Zagan for such a gift. May I ask how these grains will be distributed? I must admit that I am quite excited about tasting them for myself.”</p><p><br></p><p>“They will be sold from tomorrow at selected outlets. I will slowly expand the business at my own pace.” Mathias replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Your speech about eradicating hunger from the Underworld and it was inspiring. If possible, we would like to lend a hand towards such a noble goal as well.”</p><p><br></p><p>Mathias nodded and Euclid internally rolled his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Just a few days ago, they were more or less threatening Mathias to join under them and now their tones change completely.</p><p><br></p><p>“It just so happens that the Amy House and the Shax Houses have the best distribution chain in the Underworld and we would like to assist in the sales and proper distribution of your products through the underworld.” Lord Amy said, acting like a benevolent guy.</p><p><br></p><p>Obviously his act fooled no one, even less someone like Mathias.</p><p><br></p><p>That high ranked Senjutsu skill was hard to deceive.</p><p><br></p><p>“I appreciate your thoughts Lord Amy but as it happens, I already have distributors for my current supply. As I have already stated, my products increase the growth rates of people, it is an extremely valuable resource. I wish to control its distribution quite closely. Thus, I wish to start small and then slowly expand. For this, I have already made contracts with around a dozen houses and will expand to their territories after the capital Satan Cities. My own stores will be opened in collaboration with the owners of the territories. In the future, when I expand to other territories, I wish to follow the same method and as such I am in no immediate need of a distribution channel.”</p><p><br></p><p>Smart.</p><p><br></p><p>This would make the Lords of the Houses side with him and not have a middleman like the Amy and Shax Houses to come in between.</p><p><br></p><p>Now even if these two wish to pressure Mathias, they will be stopped by other houses who will try to get a share of the pie.</p><p><br></p><p>A stick with the firm and blatant answer to Lord Uvall and then a carrot for the other houses to bite.</p><p><br></p><p>Well played.</p><p><br></p><p>As expected, those two knew this as well and didn’t push much for now.</p><p><br></p><p>Another person got up this time.</p><p><br></p><p>Cain Marbas.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have another question. This time for Lord Lucifer.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“This has been the first time that someone has become the Lord of two houses. And while I am delighted to have two houses recover from the verge of extinction, it still causes a distortion in the balance of power. I wonder what your thoughts are about this?”</p><p><br></p><p>“There are no current or past laws stating that one person cannot be the Head of two houses at the same time. The Underworld has lost more than half the Pillar Houses in the Great War and the Civil War and a few more have lost their status after that. It has caused the power to get concentrated in the hands of fewer people. Such a thing is also bad for a healthy government as well as the future of the Underworld and as such our priority should be to stop the number of Pillar Houses from decreasing first. As for the matter of the power of two houses being in the hands of one person, it’s only for one generation. Mathias is engaged to two different people and the Lordships will separate into different hands in the future and solve this automatically.”</p><p><br></p><p>There were some more questions but people more or less avoided directly targeting Mathias for now.</p><p><br></p><p>The rest of the meeting went quite smoothly.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Lord Phenex -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He looked at his youngest son sulking, still refusing to accept his defeat.</p><p><br></p><p>“He was just lucky that I didn’t know about his Clan Trait. If we fought again, I can…”</p><p><br></p><p>Finally tired of it, he decided to stop the matters himself.</p><p><br></p><p>“You would be able to do nothing.” he stated, making him turn towards him surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>“Father?”</p><p><br></p><p>“If you think you would have a chance against him if you fought against him again, then you are sorely mistaken. Mathias is a very reasonable young man and thus he didn’t take your words to heart or… you wouldn’t be standing here complaining at this moment but rather laying on a hospital bed.” he turned towards his eldest and Riser followed his gaze.</p><p><br></p><p>Rival let out a sigh and explained. “Lord Buné Zagan… was holding back against you.”</p><p><br></p><p>Riser’s eyes widened in surprise. “Impossible. He…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Is someone whom even Armin Glasya-Labolas claims to have never defeated in a thousand fights.” Rival cut him off, making him shut his mouth in disbelief. “And if you think Armin was just saying those because of their friendship then you will be wrong because Euclid Lucifuge confirmed it too. The man had also bet five hundred million Liliums on Lord Mathias’ victory.”</p><p><br></p><p>He took over and continued. “The man you are talking about is someone who has lived in the barren lands of the Buné territory, a place beside the Pits. He stayed there almost alone and not only that, he grew and established a place there to live. Do you have any idea what kind of places the Pits are? There are creatures there even I wouldn’t wish to fight. And you were insulting and underestimating someone who treats those areas as his backyard.”</p><p><br></p><p>By this point both his sons were quiet. Riser looked down, not meeting his eyes so he let out a sigh and explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“You children don’t understand the true horrors of the Zagan Life Magic. Neither does Rudiger Rosenkreutz or Naud Gaimin or anyone who is boasting about being able to beat Mathias Buné Zagan.” He took a deep breath and recalled the stories from his own father.</p><p><br></p><p>“Being drowned by endless hordes of monsters with no end in sight. A scene like that is enough to break the wills of all but a few. From what I have heard from Zeoticus, Mathias, even among the users of Life Magic, is a prodigy with no equal so much so that the Gremory House’s Ancestor, the first Gremory, Runeas Gremory herself claimed that he has surpassed his own ancestor in the mastery of Life Magic. Let alone you, even Ruval or I would be hard pressed for our lives against someone like him. There is a reason why the Zagan house was targeted so fervently by our enemies.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Is it really that strong?” This time Ruval asked.</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded. “Keep whatever you hear here a secret. I want both of you to get along well with Lord Mathias. He is a humble person and won’t reject genuine friendship. The things I have heard… he is going to be someone who will change the whole structure of the Underworld.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you talking about the food products which he announced about?” Ruval asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Those are only a part of the reason.” He replied and turned towards his youngest son. “The Phenex House is allied with the Buné-Zagan House so I want you to behave yourself in front of Mathias. Do you understand?”</p><p><br></p><p>“...yes father.”</p><p><br></p><p>With his words said, he too got up and left. He had to make some arrangements too.</p><p><br></p><p>Mathias was going to open outlets in the territory of his allies, including his own and he needed to get things ready for it.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Mathias -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Latia and I walked back to my room to rest for the day.</p><p><br></p><p>I was held back to discuss the opening of outlets in different territories of my allies.</p><p><br></p><p>A few of them had already offered me a piece of land for opening the store branches. This included the families of the Satans, Lord Agares, Lord Belial and Lord Vapula.</p><p><br></p><p>The work will start immediately and the stores will open in about a month or two when the first four stores start running properly.</p><p><br></p><p>Today was extremely tiring.</p><p><br></p><p>I absolutely hated public appearances for this reason.</p><p><br></p><p>We opened the door to see a strange scene in front of us.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias was laying on my bed with only a blanket on her body.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked questioningly at Latia.</p><p><br></p><p>“She wanted to stay here tonight but I guess she fell asleep because we were late.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. In that case, let’s not disturb her.”</p><p><br></p><p>I went to get cleaned up before bed and she followed me.</p><p><br></p><p>Once inside the bathroom, we undressed for a bath.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the girl in front of me. It wasn’t my first time seeing her like this. In fact, we have been making out often since the first time back during the hunts but I was still amazed whenever I saw her.</p><p><br></p><p>Really, both my fiancees were beautiful.</p><p><br></p><p>She was eighteen and a half years old but looked far more mature than her age. Even Rias was eighteen or so.</p><p><br></p><p>Devils started maturing very fast.</p><p><br></p><p>I walked behind her and hugged her from the back, my staff comfortably finding a place between her asscheeks.</p><p><br></p><p>“Matty!”</p><p><br></p><p>I turned her back towards me and saw the light blush on her face and leaned down. She closed her eyes and I got the signal of acceptance as my lips took hers.</p><p><br></p><p>Her arms wrapped around me and I picked her up, taking her to the bathtub and taking a seat with her in my lap, my length rubbed on her core, all the while our tongues wrestled.</p><p><br></p><p>I pulled back from the kiss and saw her flushed face and watery eyes and couldn’t help but pull her in for another kiss which she wholeheartedly returned.</p><p><br></p><p>My hand roamed on her back, taking a hold of her perfect rear and moulding it like a soft dough, as one of my fingers brushed past her back hole, making her jerk.</p><p><br></p><p>A mischievous thought came to my head as I brushed past the same point again, making her jerk again and pull back to look at me in surprise only to see me smile.</p><p><br></p><p>“What are you doing?” She whispered, trying to keep her tone composed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Helping you clean.” I smirked as I used a spell to quickly clean her.</p><p><br></p><p>She yelped, almost jumping on my lap and looked at me with an aggrieved pout.</p><p><br></p><p>I used my fingers to make circles around her backdoor.</p><p><br></p><p>“Matty, please.”</p><p><br></p><p>“If you don’t like it, just say and I’ll stop.”</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t reply and I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>Latia, despite her usually serious demeanour, was quite adventurous in bed. She didn’t mind new things. From what I had discovered in these past few months, she liked it when I took charge.</p><p><br></p><p>She hid her face on my chest.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will have to clean you thoroughly here.” I whispered, making her look at me in shock but I was already on my way as I pushed one of my fingers inside till the first joint.</p><p><br></p><p>She clenched her ass, gripping my finger tightly, her hands gripped my hair as she hugged me tightly, her breasts getting crushed against my chest. I could feel her nipples getting hard.</p><p><br></p><p>“Just relax.” I whispered into her ear and took her earlobe into my mouth and sucked on it.</p><p><br></p><p>She loved it when I did this.</p><p><br></p><p>Slowly but surely, I pushed my finger in deeper till the second knot and she took a deep breath to relax.</p><p><br></p><p>I tried pulling out but it felt as if her ass didn’t want to let go of my finger so….I pushed back again.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mmhhh.” She muffled a moan.</p><p><br></p><p>I used a quick spell for lubrication and pulled back, this time my finger getting pulled back more easily.</p><p><br></p><p>Another moan sounded.</p><p><br></p><p>Slowly, I increased my pace and a minute later, I was comfortably fingering her backdoor. She bit my shoulder to muffle her moans, making me even more excited.</p><p><br></p><p>I increased my speed and she hugged me tighter, moving in my lap to reciprocate to the movement of my fingers, making her core rub on my length even more.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked up at me and we both stared at each other before we dived in for a kiss.</p><p><br></p><p>A minute or two later, she shivered, moaning in my mouth.</p><p><br></p><p>Did she come already?</p><p><br></p><p>That was too fast.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at her and she hid her face into my chest, not daring to meet my eye.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my, could it be that someone likes it in her ass?” I smirked.</p><p><br></p><p>In return, she bit my shoulder and glared at me although it was ruined by her blush which reached to her ears.</p><p><br></p><p>“You will not speak about this… ever.”</p><p><br></p><p>I made a motion to zip my mouth. “As you command, princess. I guess, I will just have to repeat this through my actions.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No! That’s not what I meant… ahhhh.” She stopped her sentence as I pushed my finger back in.</p><p><br></p><p>“I understand, princess.” I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>It was so much fun to tease her and see her facade break.</p><p><br></p><p>Another round later, I carried her out to the bedroom and laid her on the bed, covering ourselves with a blanket.</p><p><br></p><p>By now, I was rock hard and my length was making a tent in the blanket. She noticed this and took it in her hand, slowly moving her hands up and down.</p><p><br></p><p>I relaxed as she went down under the blanket and a moment later, I felt a warm sensation on my tip which slowly enveloped my length more.</p><p><br></p><p>One of my hands went behind her head reflexively, making her move.</p><p><br></p><p>Her movements increased and a few minutes later, I felt my climax approaching so I pressed her head lightly on my length. She understood and hugged my waist, sucking hard. The last bit of stimulation pushed me over the line as I let jets of my cum inside her mouth and fell back.</p><p><br></p><p>She came out from under the blanket and I saw her gulping down my cum. The scene made me hard again instantly. She however used a spell and cleaned her mouth before giving me a kiss. \"That's enough for tonight. Tomorrow is a very busy day too.\"</p><p><br></p><p>She said as she snuggled into my side.</p><p><br></p><p>Around twenty minutes later, her breathing evened out and I sensed that she had fallen asleep now.</p><p><br></p><p>I took the chance to turn towards my other fiance and hug her from behind. There was a slight movement but no replies came back.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Do you have anything to say, Rias?\" I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Her body stiffened.</p><p><br></p><p>She had been awake for a while now. I noticed it in between but didn't say anything to not embarrass Latia.</p><p><br></p><p>Slowly she turned towards me but kept her face hidden in my chest, not meeting my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>I placed a light kiss on her forehead and sensed her grip on me get tighter.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at me and the next moment I knew, her lips were on mine, fiercely trying to kiss me.</p><p><br></p><p>I relaxed and took her in my arms, slowly reciprocating. Her adrenaline rush seemed to pass away after a few seconds as her embarrassment took over.</p><p><br></p><p>Her speed slowed down and she tried to pull back but I held her. \"It's fine. You don't have to be embarrassed. This is quite normal. Moreover we are engaged.\"</p><p><br></p><p>She still didn't meet my eyes but nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Come here.\" I pulled her back in for another kiss while I slowly caressed her breasts. She relaxed in my arms and slowly started to reciprocate my kiss.</p><p><br></p><p>We kissed for a while and then separated.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s take one step at a time, alright.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Mmh.” She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>I guess looking at me and Latia like that made her feel a bit jealous.</p><p><br></p><p>I have been concentrating on work a lot recently and haven’t been able to spend much time with any of them lately. I will need to take them out on dates sometimes once things settle down.</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t say anything more but there was a smile on her face as she snuggled to my side and slept.</p><p><br></p><p>I guess she needed some reassurance.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>Next morning, all of us had to wake up early for another busy day.</p><p><br></p><p>Unlike yesterday, today was something I was looking forward to. The official start of my business.</p><p><br></p><p>Four of my stores will be opened in the capital cities of the four Satans today.</p><p><br></p><p>Last night, all of us had already arranged the last batch of stocks for all four stores and all that was needed was to teleport them.</p><p><br></p><p>The time of opening was 9 am and we still had four hours on our hands.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will be taking these to the Asmodeus and Sitri territories. When the shops are stocked, I will come to New Lilith for the opening ceremony.” Armin said as he and his peerage members carried all the items to be teleported.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. I will escort the goods to the Lucifer capital and Souji-san will bring the stock for the Beelzebub capital. See you at New Lilith.”</p><p><br></p><p>With that said, Armin teleported away with his peerage members.</p><p><br></p><p>I too got to work.</p><p><br></p><p>My peerage members had already arranged the things so we teleported.</p><p><br></p><p>Latia and Rias had returned back to their homes early on and will be arriving with their families for the opening ceremony.</p><p><br></p><p>I arrived at the storeroom which I had purchased a while ago. There were already several people working there since early Morning.</p><p><br></p><p>“My Lord.” I heard a voice and looked towards the direction to see a man walking towards me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Just call me Mathias, uncle.” I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>He was Logan Buné. He was the father of Ladora Buné and a distant relative of mine. The guy had fallen in love with a human magician, one of his contractors and thus my cousin Ladora was born. The man never regretted his decision despite his hard life since then.</p><p><br></p><p>My parents had often helped him and he had offered to take me in. I didn’t accept their help because, first, I had the support and protection of Sirzechs and Tiamat and second, I didn’t want to burden them. So now that I am the Head of their House, I can openly help them out.</p><p><br></p><p>Ladora was older than me and extremely hardworking.</p><p><br></p><p>I had often sent him my special crops although I never told them anything openly.</p><p><br></p><p>Recently, I disclosed everything to them and invited them to stay in the Buné territories and help me in my business.</p><p><br></p><p>Safe to say that he was quite enthusiastic.</p><p><br></p><p>I had made him the manager of the store at New Lilith while Ladora looked after the store in the Beelzebub territory.</p><p><br></p><p>They even had contracted two of my dragons as familiars for the sake of protection. I will be working to increase their strengths to the Ultimate Class in a few years.</p><p><br></p><p>“How is the work going on, Uncle?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Everything is progressing smoothly. The shop has already been stocked. With the things you have brought, even the Restaurant’s stock will be full. We will be ready to open any time.” he reported</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s great. How about the staff?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I contacted everyone I knew, who had followed our house for a long time and didn’t leave the territory despite the harsh conditions. They have been loyal to the Buné House since the time of your Grandfather. All of them responded. All of the staff were selected from among these people.” he replied as he led me to the shop.</p><p><br></p><p>The shop at New Lilith was an eleven storied building.</p><p><br></p><p>I had bought this building through Septus and Latia took care of the renovation.</p><p><br></p><p>The first four floors of the building was the store, each floor divided by the Rank of products, with the lowest floor being for F Ranked ones, then E Ranked and then D Ranked ones.</p><p><br></p><p>Above it was the floor where people could order as well as receive C Ranked products.</p><p><br></p><p>The floors above those were for the Restaurant, one separate floor for the Low Class, Mid Class, High Class Devils and the VIP Floor.</p><p><br></p><p>Above that was a bar where different alcohols from my farm were sold.</p><p><br></p><p>The tenth floor was for the auction of the B Ranked Products and the top floor was the office for staff.</p><p><br></p><p>The warehouse was in the basement floors of the building.</p><p><br></p><p>I had fortified the entire place from top till the bottom with my best wards. This building was as protected as the Lucifer Castle in the same city and that was saying something.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a very low chance that someone would try to attack it in the Lucifer capital but why take any chances?</p><p><br></p><p>As for the name of the Restaurant… Hotel Gourmet.</p><p><br></p><p>I decided to create a Hotel Gourmet of my own in this world.</p><p><br></p><p>The staff was running around in a hurry, getting things ready at the last minute.</p><p><br></p><p>They were getting a thirty percent discount on a certain amount of products till the D Rank so they were happy.</p><p><br></p><p>Time passed.</p><p><br></p><p>I had sent invitations to every house as well as my allies for the opening of my first store at New Lilith.</p><p><br></p><p>This time, I wanted to see how many of them will appear.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Venelana Gremory -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She waited for the arrival of Zekram as she drank her tea.</p><p><br></p><p>Zeoticus was sitting beside him and her mother-in-law and the Gremory ancestor was sitting in front of them.</p><p><br></p><p>Runeas Gremory was eating her favourite pudding with great enthusiasm.</p><p><br></p><p>“You seem to enjoy this sweet a lot, ancestor.” her mother-in-law asked with a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm. Crusty makes amazing puddings.” She smiled, taking another spoonful of the dessert.</p><p><br></p><p>Crusty was the name of the Pudding Camel which she had gotten as a gift from Mathias and she agreed, it really made amazing puddings.</p><p><br></p><p>“If you like those then I think you will enjoy today’s party even more. You couldn’t see it the last time but Mathias has a tree which grows different confectioneries seasons. You can get as many sweets as you like there.”</p><p><br></p><p>Runeas stopped eating and looked at them in surprise. “Seriously?! A confectionery tree? That boy, just what goes on in that head of his? Even Zagan wasn’t that crazy. But then again he was crazy in a different way. Instead of plants and animals which could be eaten by people, he enjoyed creating plants and animals who enjoyed eating people. In comparison, the boy is quite sane.”</p><p><br></p><p>This got them curious.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ancestor.” Zeoticus asked, interested in the sudden topic.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Just what kind of man was the original Zagan?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Zagan? He was…”</p><p><br></p><p>“... A shut in mad scientist.” The answer came from a different direction.</p><p><br></p><p>They looked in the direction of the voice and saw the man they had been waiting for coming.</p><p><br></p><p>Zeoticus walked forward and received him as she and her mother-in-law stood up and bowed as well.</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded but his eyes didn’t leave Runeas the whole time.</p><p><br></p><p>“You look old.” Runeas said, looking up from her pudding before diving back into it.</p><p><br></p><p>They sweatdropped.</p><p><br></p><p>“And you look just as bratty as before.” He smiled before taking a seat.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmph. See, you are even talking like an old man now.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, I am old.” He shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>They kept quiet, watching their conversation from the side.</p><p><br></p><p>“I assume you woke up because of the Zagan boy this time?” He asked, directly getting to the topic. He looked at them. “That brat Sirzechs pulled a fast one on all of us. He’s learning things now.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yup. It was quite smart.” Runeas replied nonchalantly.</p><p><br></p><p>“And it has caused quite a ruckus all over the Underworld.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Right! It was hilarious watching him fight with a hoe. That chicken brat didn’t stand a chance hahahaha.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Zekram rolled his eyes at her antics. “So… did you meet him?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. I even got specially made camels from him.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! Did he recognise you?” He asked. “Knowing you, there is no way you didn’t try to trick him.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Tch. That boy is too smart for his own good. That Buné aspect of his identified me. He even sensed that my Demonic Power was extremely old. Seriously, even Zagan couldn’t do it. I know, I have pulled many pranks on him and he never found out. At least he knows how to please others. The camels I got from him are the new gems of my collection.” She pushed a plate of pudding towards him and summoned a bottle of wine.</p><p><br></p><p>Zekram poured the wine for himself and took a sip.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, this is quite good. I can see why the boy was so confident in his products.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmph, that wine comes from my special Wine Camels. Instead of milk, they produce high quality wine.” She replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“Produce wine?”</p><p><br></p><p>“How would I know? Zagans and their crazy brains. He apparently has a tree of confectioneries on his farm too.”</p><p><br></p><p>Zekram had a strange look on his face. “Yes. Zagans were always weird. Strange but talented nonetheless. After all, there was a reason Lord Lucifer wanted to name him as the second Great King of the Underworld. The Great King of Creation, mirroring my own self.”</p><p><br></p><p>What!</p><p><br></p><p>Their eyes widened at the sudden reveal of the information.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah. If only Beelzebub hadn’t been a prick back then. I mean what reason was there for him to be jealous of Zagan because he could make more kinds of flies than him? Even little kids aren’t that petty.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Only they knew what went on in their heads. From your words it seems that you like him.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I guess I will have to invite him over for tea sometime. I would have already if I had been informed earlier.” He looked at them and then back towards his wine.</p><p><br></p><p>“It was for the safety of Mathias. Even we were not told anything about him.” Her mother-in-law defended.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh drop it. You know those fools on the council would have chewed the boy out before he could even grow. Not to mention that mess with Naberius. Seriously, what’s wrong with these fools? If you are experimenting on people, do it to other races. There are still angels and fallen angels alive in this world. Why go after our own?” Runeas complained.</p><p><br></p><p>“Just because they call themselves the Great King faction doesn’t mean they are all controlled by me. Most of the time, I don’t even know what they do. And I don’t interfere as long as they don’t go too far. That’s how children grow after all. What Naberius did had crossed the line and thus the entire house is currently suffering. I didn’t defend him.” Zekram shrugged, pouring himself another cup.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. Isn’t that because you are lazy?” Runeas joked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Says the one who sleeps for thousands of years.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Touché.” She smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have heard that you have engaged your daughter to him.” he turned towards her and asked.</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded. “They get along very well.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Good work. Bind him with your family. From what little I have heard, his talents could bring about a great change in the Underworld. Make sure you keep him attached to the devil race and the current government as much as possible.”</p><p><br></p><p>She couldn’t resist raising an eyebrow at this.</p><p><br></p><p>Zekram saw her reaction and rolled his eyes. “Just what kind of monster do you think I am? I am already retired. If there’s something I care about right now, it's the progress and development of the Devil Race and that boy’s talents have the potential to transform the entire society into something greater, just like Ajuka. I am not a fool to ruin or distance such a talent… well, unless he stands on the opposite side of the Underworld. After all, I have seen the true horror of Zagan with my own eyes. I would not let someone even more talented than him turn against the underworld.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Mathias has no such intentions. In fact, he is a very friendly boy who doesn’t even involve himself with politics. He enjoys working on his farm without disturbance. Moreover, he is extremely close to Rias and Latia as well as his friends.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A shut-in just like his ancestor.” Runeas added. “But yes. He’s safe. Sirzechs and the rest ran several psych tests on him since his childhood. Actually, we were going to the opening ceremony of his shop. Why don’t you join us too? There will be far better food and wine than this stuff. The boy keeps the best things stuffed in a separate collection and I plan to drink him dry today.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh. I did hear about the shop. Very well, since that’s the case, I will join. Let’s see if the food craze of the Zagan is really worth its name.”</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Mathias is finally out in the open and the Underworld is shaken.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Things are picking up pace.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I was about to write the reactions of other factions in this chapter but decided to wait till his food is launched and then write the full reaction of Heavens as well as the other factions.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>As for now, Mathias is opening his business and will do his best to overcome challenges in it.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Oh and also a little bit of lemons.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>P.S: Something interesting will happen in the next few chapters.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br><br></p>",

And no, ‘it might get destroyed’ is not a good reason. Clothes almost always get destroyed in a Rating Game but that doesn’t mean we are going to let you go out in that.” She pointed to my trusted farm clothes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hey! These bad boys can withstand dragon flames and barely get singed.” I complained. Even Phoenix Flames can be resisted.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean I could totally use some of the other clothes I have but what’s the use of destroying clothes worth millions of Lilium just to show off.</p><p><br></p><p>At least that’s my way of thinking… which is apparently wrong.</p><p><br><br><br></p><p>“Good. Although I doubt that level of Dragon Flame would even singe your hair. Next time maybe, you can get clothes of a better design instead of these. What’s next? Are you going to carry a shovel to the fight?”</p><p><br>“No way… carrying a shovel would be overkill for the likes of Riser.” I joked.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>It did bring a light smile to their faces and cooled the atmosphere a little bit.</p><p><br></p><p>Today was the day of the Rating Game and I was getting ready… or rather, the girls were playing dress up dolls on me.</p><p><br></p><p>Although, they do have a good taste in clothes.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the Gremory’s primary businesses is clothing and Latia has been a little princess from the very start so both of them have a very high standard for clothing.</p><p><br></p><p>They don’t mind wearing farm clothes while training but they wouldn’t go out in one of them… ever.</p><p><br></p><p>“There, all done.” Rias said, after stepping back and taking a final look at me.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at myself in the mirror and I did look good.</p><p><br></p><p>The crests of both my houses were on my chest. Finally, there was no need to hide things. It’s been so long that I feel a bit strange wearing this outside.</p><p><br></p><p>We took a few pictures as the rest prepared for our first Rating Game.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hiiiiiii! I am so scared, Valerie. There will be so many peopleeeeeee.” Gasper squeaked at the thought of appearing in front of the crowd.</p><p><br></p><p>The little guy had gotten better but he was still only twelve years old and having a bit of stage fear was quite understandable.</p><p><br></p><p>“We will be in a different dimension so there will only be a few people there.” Valerie consoled. I mean, she was not wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>Ingvild and Lavinia were ready. Natsume didn’t like fighting much but she was training and eating the food from the farm with everyone for over a year and she was still quite strong. And combined with the Sacred Gear, she could fight people at the peak of High Class easily to a standstill.</p><p><br></p><p>Tia will not be fighting for obvious reasons. I didn’t ask Crom to fight either.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean, talk about killing a fly with a cannon.</p><p><br></p><p>To be honest, Shizuka alone could destroy their entire peerage if she was left alone but today was supposed to be a lesson, not a massacre.</p><p><br></p><p>As we were preparing, a magic circle lit up in the area and Armin appeared from there with his own peerage. We are supposed to go to Agreas Island together.</p><p><br></p><p>The biggest Rating Game stadium in the Underworld was booked for us.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a high profile Rating Game after all. On one side was Riser Phenex, the upcoming Rating Game player and the younger brother of the ninth ranked Rating Game player, Ruval Phenex and on the other side was the new Lord of two Houses one of which was the Zagan.</p><p><br></p><p>The island was in the territory of Archduke Agares and the guy himself wanted to promote the Rating Game along with the other few who I was in a process of making an alliance with.</p><p><br></p><p>Due to this, what was supposed to be a normal match was transformed into this mess.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ready?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Mostly.”</p><p><br></p><p>He raised an eyebrow at my response.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am more worried about the Press Conference and then the Council meeting afterwards.” I sighed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well… no helping that.”</p><p><br></p><p>All of us were ready and I teleported everyone to the Agares territory where Septus had asked us to come. From there, he will guide us to the stadium.</p><p><br></p><p>The crowd was gathering. Septus was waiting for us with Leila and the Gremorys.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mathias, come. You need to get there an hour before time to register the peerage members who will be fighting today.” Leila instructed.</p><p><br></p><p>We followed them.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, who are you planning to let fight?” Septus asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Not sure. I haven’t seen Riser’s peerage yet. I will think of something when I get there.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Just make sure it’s something which attracts the attention of the people.” Latia repeated.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, as much as I don’t like flashy fights, I will have to agree that a show of power will certainly help in this situation.” Leila said too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Right. I hope that after today people will stop annoying me.” Armin smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah. That’s what he has been happy about.</p><p><br></p><p>I left with my peerage members to register them first.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Armin -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He sat down in the VIP rooms booked for them by Lord Agares.</p><p><br></p><p>The place mainly housed the VIPs from several families but mainly the families of the current Satans.</p><p><br></p><p>After Mathias’ reveal, his father had asked him about Matty. His brother was there so he answered most of their questions. His father wanted to express his gratitude for helping him out. He knew Matty would probably just say he was doing what any friend would do but that was not even close to the reality.</p><p><br></p><p>His father was talking about alliances but decided to leave the matter to him since he was friends with Mathias.</p><p><br></p><p>‘Let the next generation decide the direction they want to take.’ His father said.</p><p><br></p><p>The best thing which happened since then was that he could eat his favourite food anywhere he wanted. Oh and Zephyrdor had been quiet since the reveal too.</p><p><br></p><p>One by one the room was filled with people.</p><p><br></p><p>Sairaorg sat in the front row with Rias, Latia and their peerages.</p><p><br></p><p>A few minutes later, Euclid Lucifuge entered the room with his wife and daughter. His wife and daughter sat with Lady Sitri while Euclid took a seat beside him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did I miss anything?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Nothing yet. They haven’t even entered the preparation phase.Matty took his peerage to get registered for the match.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Any idea about who will be fighting?”</p><p><br></p><p>“He said he had something planned.”</p><p><br>Euclid scoffed at the statement. “Does he even need to plan anything?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Who knows what goes on in that brain of his?” He smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha true.”</p><p><br></p><p>As they were talking, some new people entered the room. He looked back to see the Phenex House entering the room.</p><p><br></p><p>Lord Gremory stood up to greet them.</p><p><br></p><p>The atmosphere of the room changed a bit with their arrival.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is this seat taken?” Ruval Phenex asked after walking up to him.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. Please make yourself comfortable.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man took the seat and looked ahead.</p><p><br></p><p>At the same time the announcements took place.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>“Welcome Ladies and Gentlemen. I am Naud Gaimin, the host for today’s match between Riser Phenex and… oh my, if this wasn’t a surprise… Lord Mathias Buné Zagan. Both Players will be given a preparation time of twenty minutes during which they can prepare for the upcoming fight but cannot leave their designated areas. Please give a big round of applause for both sides. To comment on this match, we have with us the seventh Ranked Rating Game Player, Rüdiger Rosenkreuz.”</em></strong> The screen shifted towards the stadium.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>“The model for the games field is based on the Demonic Forests of the Asmodel. I must say this is an interesting choice of field. What do you think, Mr. Rosenkreuz?”</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>“It is. This field can bring out the powers of both sides quite well. The members of both peerages can hide in the cover of the forest and the density of the demonic energy in the forest makes it very hard for conventional methods of detection to work. It would show us their abilities of stealth and detection as well as the ability of both kings to control their peerages and coordinate their moves in such circumstances.”</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>“That would certainly be a challenge. What about the Kings themselves?”</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>“We’ve seen Riser Phenex participate in two matches so we can make some guesses about him. Lord Mathias on the other hand is a complete mystery. We don’t know anything about him or his peerage let alone his style of fighting or specialities. But if we were to make some guesses, then according to the rumours, Lord Mathias is a user of the famed Life Magic which means he could use the forests to his advantage whereas Riser Phenex could burn the whole forest making it a battlefield advantageous to him due to his Phenex Bloodline. But regardless it is a field which can bring out the abilities of both sides.”</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Rosenkreuz has always been good at analysing people.” Ruval Phenex said.</p><p><br></p><p>Well, his analysis was not wrong… if it was about anyone else rather than an anomaly like Mathias.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>“So, who do you think has a better chance of winning this match, Mr. Rosenkreuz?” </em></strong>Naud asked.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>“Hmm, that’s hard to say but if Riser Phenex chooses to burn the entire forest, he would have a very great advantage in terms of the field. The Phenex Regeneration will enable him to fight in a place where others cannot. I can think of several ways to abuse that.”</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>“Oh, so you are saying that Riser Phenex has better chances of winning?”</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>“Counting in his experience in two Rating Games and assuming he has had the guidance of his elder brother, Ruval Phenex, the ninth Rank holder of the Rating Games, I would assume so. On the other hand, Lord Mathias is….well, I don’t know much about him to put forth a case from his side. I apologise for that.”</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>“Quite true. And that’s one of the things which makes this Game such an exciting one. With this said, let’s begin the games.”</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p>Both teams entered their twenty minute preparation phase.</p><p><br></p><p>“Everyone is so excited for Mathias’ first match.” Euclid began the conversation.</p><p><br></p><p>Ruval looked slightly embarrassed. “I am sorry for Riser’s behaviour. I tried to stop this from happening but… We might have offended Lord Buné Zagan.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t need to worry. Mathias said that he was not exactly angry. It’s quite hard to piss off that guy. He would just laugh off something of this level.” he replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“Armin is right. Mathias is quite understanding in such matters.” Euclid said.</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Sigh</em>… still, I will make sure he apologises to Lord Buné Zagan when this match is over.” The guy did look quite apologetic.</p><p><br></p><p>Euclid decided to lend a hand and change the topic.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, what are the odds this time around?” Euclid asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“1 to 2.4 against Mathias.” He answered. He had already invested all his personal savings on Mathias.</p><p><br></p><p>The girls had done the same.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, even his father had done the same.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh… that’s… a bit lower than I expected.” Euclid replied but he could see that the man was placing the bets simultaneously.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s mostly just as Mr. Rosenkreuz stated, because this is Mathias’ first fight while Riser has won both his previous matches in an overwhelming manner. That and the fact that most of the people except the other Pillars don’t even know Mathias’ name yet.”</p><p><br></p><p>“True, I suppose.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So who do you people think will win?” Lord Sitri asked from behind.</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously Mathias.” He answered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Big Bro will win.” Sairaorg chimed in.</p><p><br></p><p>The girls and their peerages were the same.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha the kids have a lot of faith in him.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm, if I might say something.” Ruval interrupted.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I might not like what he did but Riser is not exactly weak. In fact he wishes to pursue Rating Games seriously and has made you, the strongest of his generation as a goal. He has been training since your first match to catch up to you. I don’t know how strong Lord Mathias is but…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Tell me, Heir Phenex, who do you think would win in a fight between me and your younger brother?” He interrupted.</p><p><br></p><p>An odd expression appeared on the eldest Phenex son’s face. “While Riser is strong, I have seen your match and I don’t think Riser has any chance of winning against you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That does make me curious, how strong is Mathias?” Lord Sitri asked. “You must know because you two are quite close.” Others looked at him for the answer too.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at Ruval Phenex and answered. “If Riser doesn’t stand a chance of winning against me… then he wouldn’t even be able to touch Mathias’ sleeve.”</p><p><br></p><p>“In all the time we have been friends, I have fought him over a thousand times, and till now, I have never been able to beat him… ever.”</p><p><br></p><p>He left the topic at that, leaving the newer members of the place in stunned silence.</p><p><br></p><p>What he didn’t say was that, in those thousand or so matches, he hadn’t even been able to put a single scratch on him in a solo fight, or make him use his dragon form… or any kind of magic for that matter.</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t want to reveal Matty’s strength without his permission, but this level of information would keep these people from underestimating him.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, if they knew how strong Lord Mathias Buné Zagan actually was… that might cause some of them to lose their heads. Better not to stir trouble.</p><p><br></p><p>Lord Sitri collected himself and looked at Euclid. “This…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, Mathias will win. I bet five hundred million Liliums on him so hope he does.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>As they were speaking, both sides started to move.</p><p><br></p><p>Riser’s side split into several groups and laid down traps around their own base to trap any of Mathias’ pawns who would want to promote to a Queen.</p><p><br></p><p>Too bad for him, they wouldn’t need any kind of promotion for this kind of fight</p><p><br></p><p>Mathias’ team on the other hand were waiting in their base and…</p><p><br></p><p>“Damn, I wanted to bring something to eat too.” Euclid laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>They were having a snack break.</p><p><br></p><p><em>‘Umm, what is our plan for today’s game?’</em> Ingvild asked, feeling a bit shy at their behaviour.</p><p><br></p><p>‘Hmm, well Riser did challenge me, so… I will go and fight. You all stay here and defend the base.’ Mathias replied nonchalantly, continuing to eat.</p><p><br></p><p>His peerage members didn’t question him either.</p><p><br></p><p>When there were just a few minutes left for the fight to begin, he walked out of his base and brought something out with his space magic.</p><p><br></p><p>… a hoe.</p><p><br></p><p>He really won’t…</p><p><br></p><p>The whole room reacted to this.</p><p><br></p><p>Latia blanched lightly.</p><p><br></p><p>Leila Astaroth shook her head with a sigh while Venelana Gremory giggled.</p><p><br></p><p>The Lords had an off look on their faces.</p><p><br></p><p>The one who had the best time was probably the Gremory Ancestor. “Bwahahahaha he really did it.”</p><p><br></p><p>She was having a hard time staying still due to all the laughing.</p><p><br></p><p>Mathias, unbothered by all this, cleared a part of the land and sowed a few seeds a little distance from one another. </p><p><br></p><p>The time passed and the announcement came. </p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>“Start the match.”</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p>Riser's side headed straight from different directions towards Mathias' base. </p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>“This is strange. Why is Mathias Zagan not moving?”</em></strong> The announcer asked, confused. </p><p><br></p><p>Sure enough, the entire peerage of Riser surrounded Mathias.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“Are you giving up already? What excuse do you have this time?”</em> Riser said imperiously. </p><p><br></p><p><em>“Why would I give up?”</em> Mathias asked, confused.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“Oh, then you want to get beaten up?”</em></p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Even Ruval Phenex facepalmed at his comment.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“Nah, I will pass. I was planning to fight anyway. Let’s get started.”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“Hahahaha get started? You’re alone, surrounded by my entire peerage and you want to fight me. Who do you think you are? Armin Glasya-Labolas?”</em></p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>He knew that the jab was aimed at Matty but somehow he felt his own face sting at the misdirected verbal slap.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“Well, thanks for waiting. It’s almost time.”</em> Mathias smiled. Just at that moment, the ground where he had sowed the seeds burst open and green coloured imp-like creatures with heads like cabbages, jumped out from them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Those are…” Rias exclaimed, attracting everyone’s attention.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you know what those are, Rias?” Zeoticus asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm… they are Saibamen from Drag-so-ball.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“What?” Everyone looked confused.</p><p><br></p><p>“They are species evolved from plants and used as weapons by the Frieza Force in the Drag-so-ball manga. They can have a power level of 1200.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully, Euclid took control of the conversation. “We are seeing an example of the Zagan Life Magic.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh. And there are a dozen of them. That’s already a decently strong force. Really, the Zagan Life Magic is cheating.”</p><p><br></p><p>It was. He was sure they would try to restrict his Life Magic in Rating Games in one way or the other. Though, that would probably not work as it <em>is</em> his Clan Trait. Doing so will only make them dig a hole for further changes which would be disadvantageous for them in the long run.</p><p><br></p><p>As expected, Riser was taken aback at the appearance of the creatures and ordered his peerage to attack.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s when things took a turn.</p><p><br></p><p>No one expected the little creatures to be that fast or strong.</p><p><br></p><p>Riser’s pawns were retired in almost an instant. His rook managed to hold one of them off while his Queen held another one off.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>“Six of Riser Phenex’s Pawns have been retired.”</em></strong> The announcer said and the surprise in his voice was easy for everyone to hear.</p><p><br></p><p>Two of his Knights were struggling against one of them. One of them took an injury and while the creature was attacking her, the other Knight managed to stab it in the back.</p><p><br></p><p>What they didn’t expect was the creature catching a hold of her weapon… and self-destructing.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>“Two of Riser Phenex’s Knights have been retired.”</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Oh yes. They can self-destruct against stronger enemies.” Rias added.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>The other members of Riser’s peerage quickly tried to make a distance while he himself bombarded the area with his flame attacks, creating a huge forest fire in an attempt to take down the creatures.</p><p><br></p><p>To everyone’s surprise though, the little creatures all jumped on to his peerage members and started to self destruct.</p><p><br></p><p>A series of explosions sounded in the field.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>“Riser Phenex’s Queen, two Rooks, one Bishop and one Pawn have retired.”</em></strong></p><p>It had only been three minutes since the fight had started and Riser Phenex’s entire peerage was destroyed.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Riser himself was blasted into the ground. </p><p><br></p><p>And all this time, Mathias was standing on the side… eating a fruit.</p><p><br></p><p>Riser got up, a bit out of balance… only for Mathias to snap a finger.</p><p><br></p><p>Another one of those creatures popped out of the ground, latched on to Riser… and exploded again.</p><p><br></p><p>Those creatures had hidden underground to avoid the fire attack of Riser and waited there quietly for an opportunity.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“Fight me like a man!”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“Eh? I am fighting you like one. I mean you surrounded me with your entire peerage too. Are you saying that you are not a man?”</em></p><p><br></p><p>“… well, he’s got a point.” Euclid whispered.</p><p><br></p><p>He saw from the corner of his eyes that Ruval Phenex was looking at the battlefield, dumbfounded.</p><p><br></p><p>Riser couldn’t even speak another word because he was bombarded by the explosions of the remaining green creatures.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>“Riser Phenex has retired. The winner of the match is… Mathias Buné Zagan.”</em></strong> The disbelief in the announcer’s voice was easy for everyone to hear.</p><p><br></p><p>And thus ended the highly anticipated first match between Riser Phenex and Mathias Buné Zagan… in the time it took Mathias to eat a surprise apple.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Sirzechs -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“...well, that was something.” Serafall said as she got up from her seat.</p><p><br></p><p>“He grew foot soldiers from that ground and you say it was just something?” Falbium scoffed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Considering the fact that he can make real Dragons, foot soldiers seem almost cute. I even want them to perform in my next movie as the villain’s minions.”</p><p><br></p><p>“He didn’t reveal his strength.” Falbium said after he calmed down a bit.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. He discussed it with Leila. He knows that someone might try to attack him and revealing his strength will only give them an opportunity to prepare countermeasures, so he hid his real capabilities.” Ajuka told them.</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t think any would try to attack him if he went all out in a show of strength in the Rating Games.” Serafall rolled her eyes at this.</p><p><br></p><p>“Riser was too weak for such a thing. The only reason Mathias even went through all this was because of Lord Phenex’s request.” He defended.</p><p><br></p><p>“I think the strength he showed was enough for now. He took down a relatively strong High Class Devil without even lifting a hand. That’s not something many eighteen year olds could do.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Not to mention the chaos it would have caused at the reveal of his Peerage members. It’s better if we handle one thing at a time. Let’s solve the next thing first.”</p><p><br></p><p>\"Yes. The main event is what comes up next.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"The Press Conference.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I am sure that I will be getting calls from Azazel and Michael soon. I need to prepare for that too.\" Serafall said. \"So you guys take care of the Press Conference and the Council Meeting.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Ughh, it's going to be such a headache. I can already feel it. The council members making noise about his heritage.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Meh, it depends on him as well. Let's see how he handles it.\" Falbium shrugged. \"We have already done what we could do.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"True. For now, I want to see how much profit I made from the bets.\" He smiled. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>– Mathias –</strong></p><p><br></p><p>\"It was awesome. You should have seen the faces of the Phenex family. They were looking at the field in shock.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Did you really have to bring out the hoe?\" Latia pouted. </p><p><br></p><p>\"I was growing stuff… And as we discussed, a shovel would have been too much.\" I joked. </p><p><br></p><p>\"They are going to make fun of you. It will make getting people in your territory harder.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Don't worry about it. They saw me using the Zagan Life Magic and taking down an upcoming High Class Devil without any effort. It's good enough to attract some people. Not to mention, our real bait is the food products and the opportunities we offer.\" I said, reassuring her lightly. </p><p><br></p><p>She let out a huff. \" Then, you better not mess up the Press Conference.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I won't. I promise.\" I smiled at her. </p><p><br></p><p>\"Hmm.\"</p><p><br></p><p>I then turned towards Rias. \"The game is over and Riser has learned his lesson. The Phenex family didn't want any of this and the only reason they even allowed it was because Lord Phenex wanted me to teach him a lesson.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"What!\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"He told me to beat him up and in return he will make an alliance with our house. Ruval even apologised to me more than once. So, let this matter go.\"</p><p><br></p><p>“I….okay.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s my girl.” I hugged both of them.</p><p><br></p><p>We left the room to meet others. There was still some time before the conference and people wanted to congratulate me on my victory.</p><p><br></p><p>“You really wanted to do it, didn’t you?” Armin complained as soon as we met.</p><p><br></p><p>“What?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t play dumb. You held back. I finally thought I would get some load off my head when you have your first Rating Game and you completely avoided all of that.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh… I didn’t want to beat him up too bad. The guy was already heartbroken. To break his body above that would have been too mean.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sigh… I don’t know what to say anymore. Have you watched the reaction of the people about your Rating Game?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Reaction?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. The Underworld has mixed opinions about your performance. On one hand people are going crazy at the demonstration of Life Magic and on the other hand people are making assumptions to downplay your fight.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh? How so?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Some are saying that you could only do what you did because no one knew about the abilities of the Zagan Clan Trait, Life Magic and that Riser was just caught off guard. Against an experienced player, it wouldn’t have worked.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, there is some truth to that too. I don’t think something like that would have worked on Diehauser Belial. That guy would have countered it with one look. And I am still a newbie Rating Game player. After all, not everyone can be ‘The Beast behind the Glasses, Armin Glasya-Labolas.” I joked ,making him roll his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are having too much fun with this, aren’t you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yup.”</p><p><br></p><p>We joked around till we reached the TV Station where Naud Gaimin would take my interview.</p><p><br></p><p>Latia and Rias took the opportunity to fix my dress one last time and I entered the room for the interview.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Latia Astaroth -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>They watched the interview from outside.</p><p><br></p><p>Mathias looked like a proper Lord with his attire and mannerism.</p><p><br></p><p>This guy… he knew all the etiquette but didn’t follow any of it because he found it too troublesome.</p><p><br></p><p>He sat in front of the most famous anchor of the Underworld, Naud Gaimin.</p><p><br></p><p>She had already fixed things about this interview with the Gaimin house instead of the Marbas on the condition that they had to show Mathias in a positive light.</p><p><br></p><p>The payment was the rights to the Rating Game’s broadcast privilege.</p><p><br></p><p>After all, there were more than a few people who wanted to broadcast the first public appearance of Lord of the Buné and Zagan Houses after such a long time.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“Welcome Lord Buné Zagan. I am Naud Gaimin, your host for tonight. I hope you didn’t have any trouble coming here?”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“No trouble at all. And please call me Mathias. Lord Buné Zagan can be a mouthful in long conversations.”</em> He smiled</p><p><br></p><p><em>“ Hahahaha alright, Mathias then. First of all, I would like to congratulate you on ascension to the position of the Lord of Buné and Zagan Houses. I must say that to have two such big names rejoin the Pillars is a happy surprise for everyone.”</em></p><p><br></p><p>Happy surprise?</p><p><br></p><p>She doubted that.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“Thank you. It was a surprise for me too.”</em> He smiled.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“Hahahaha that brings me to the next question. How? How exactly did this happen? I apologise for bringing up the bad memories but from what I found out, your parents, Lord Morton and Lady Selena were… caught up in the Naberius Scandal. And from what we know, you have no close relatives. So, how does a kid from the infamous Buné wastelands reach this position? I am sure it must have a very great story behind it. If you don’t mind, would you share it with us?”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“To be honest, it just happened. Even I was not expecting anything like this. I was quite young after all. I had gone to get tested to receive my Evil Pieces and encountered Lord Lucifer by chance there. We talked and he personally took my test and found out about my Zagan Heritage, a well kept secret. He has helped me since then and well….here we are.”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“So you lived in those wastelands all by yourself?”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“Yes. Those are my lands. It is my home.”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“Ah, I apologise, I didn’t mean to…”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“It’s fine. What I mean is, if even the Lord of the Land gives up on it, then who would care for it. Those are my lands and the place I was born. I know there are many things wrong with it but it is my responsibility to fix those. As for how I was able to survive there, I was offered another safer place by Lord Lucifer but I rejected it so he provided for my security.”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“I see. Still, all of this was quite secretive. Not even the other Lords knew about the revival of the House until your coming of age party. Many of us were wondering why that is so?”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“Well… that had many reasons behind it. First of all, as we all know, my parents had disappeared under suspicious circumstances. The Satans were investigating it and didn’t want to alert the ones involved. I agreed. Secondly, my Zagan heritage has been the target of other factions for a long time. Revealing my identity while I was not capable of protecting myself would have been a great danger to my life. We decided that the best form of protection I could get till then was anonymity.”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“And they were certainly correct to do so. We have already seen a demonstration of your strength. And what a demonstration it was. Riser Phenex is an up and coming player in the Rating Game field. He was even predicted to be someone who can become a top ranker in the Rating Games, and yet you took him out so easily. Not just him but his entire peerage. That kind of feat has never happened in the entire history of Rating Games. Even someone like Armin Glasya-Labolas had to blitz the other King in his game to win.”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“I don’t think it would be right to compare Armin’s game with mine. He was fighting someone in the top fifties of the Rating Game rankings while I was fighting someone who had only participated in two Rating Games. Armin is a very strong guy who has worked very hard to reach his level of strength.”</em></p><p><br></p><p>“He is having too much fun with this.” Armin’s eyes twitched and she held back a smile.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“True but even he didn’t have such an easy time.”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“I took advantage of the surprise my Life Magic can offer.”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“Yes, about that. There have been quite a few comments about your Rating Game. Shall we take a look at them?”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“Sure.”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“The Emperor, Diehauser Belial says- It was an interesting show of Magic on Lord Buné Zagan’s part. I can imagine the many ways in which one can use such magic. I wish to go up against him when he gains a bit more experience in Rating Games.”</em></p><p><br></p><p>“The Belial were allied with the Buné for a long time. I found out about this when I was reading up on the history of the Buné House.” Rias said.</p><p><br></p><p>Oh. She looked at Rias. “You were reading up on history?”</p><p><br></p><p>The girl looked a bit embarrassed. “Both of you were working so hard and I wanted to help too. So I am taking lessons from my mother on politics.”</p><p><br></p><p>She smiled at her words. “That’s good.”</p><p><br></p><p>Mathias didn’t have any interest in politics and neither did she. Also, with her Bael and Gremory blood, she would be far better suited for politics than her.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“The former Dragon King, Tannin said - I wish he had shown his Buné side in the fight. It would be exciting to see another Dragon in the Rating Games.”</em></p><p><br></p><p>“Mathias is planning on making a trade relationship with the Dragons under Tannin. They are going to discuss the sale of Dragon Cherries and Dragon Apples.” She supplied, trying to offer some information which might come useful for her studies.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias nodded and looked back at the interview.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“And now to some comments from the other side of the spectrum. Arnus Paimon, the sixth place Rating Game player says- He just won because of his opponent’s naivety. That kind of thing wouldn’t work on experienced Rating Game players.”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“Third ranked Rating Game player, Bedzee Abadon says- I could beat him with a hand tied behind my back.”</em></p><p><br></p><p>That bastard…</p><p><br></p><p>If Mathias wasn’t holding back… would he even have the guts to say this?</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t let it bother you. Matty is far stronger than the likes of him. Treat it as the blabbering of a fool.” Armin said lightly. She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“What do you think of them, Mathias?”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“First of all, I would like to thank them for taking time out of their busy schedules to watch my match. Thank you all.” </em>Mathias started.<em> “The Emperor, Diehauser Belial and Blaze Meteor Dragon, Tannin. I have had the opportunity to meet both of them. They are really kind and helpful.”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“I have heard that the House of Duke Buné used to be allied to the House of King Belial.”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“They were commanders under King Belial to be precise. Over the years, this changed into a deep friendship. I wish to reestablish the relationship between our houses again to honour the bond of our ancestors.”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“That's great news for the Underworld.”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“Now about Lord Paimon. The fact that he thinks it would need experienced Rating Game players to win against me, someone who has only participated in his first Rating Game today, is already a very big praise. He was not wrong either. I cannot see the move which I used against Riser, working against someone like Diehauser Belial. And finally, for Bedzee Abadon’s comment, if someone of his level couldn’t defeat an eighteen year old newbie that easily… it would be quite shameful for him, right?”</em> Mathias smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>Good. He avoided those comments quite well.</p><p><br></p><p>“Now I really want to see Matty beat the snot out of that bastard.” Rias whispered.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s fine. Matty is not interested in Rating Games as it is. You are the one who wants to become the champion. Train your peerage and fight him when you are ready.” She replied, although a part of her really wanted to see Mathias beat that arrogant bastard too.</p><p><br></p><p>The interview continued.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“That’s… quite humble of you. Now, then, shall we move off to another topic? We have heard about your farm. In fact, that’s been known to the Underworld for a long time. We have also heard that you wish to expand towards the food and agriculture industry. Can you tell us something about it?”<br><br></em></p><p><em>“Yes. I  do have plans to do so. I mean, as a Zagan, isn’t that an obvious choice?”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“And it’s a great choice too. I have tasted the food from your farm and I must say that it’s the best thing I have eaten in my life. I can see your products being a massive hit in the Underworld too. But, it does raise a question. Products of such a high level, would they be available for the common masses too or will you only be targeting the higher classes?”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“The products will be available for every devil. My products are divided into several ranks, starting from F- to B+. Each of these Ranks is for a different level of strength, F being Low Class, E, Middle Class, D High Class, C Ultimate Class and finally B for the Satan Class beings. My products are not just simple delicious food, they also provide an increase in the growth of Physical Power and Demonic Power as well as affinity to certain elements.”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“What?!”</em></p><p><br></p><p>Checkmate.</p><p><br></p><p>A small smile appeared on the corner of her lips.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a moment of silence around her which was soon replaced by a cacophony of sounds.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“Lord Buné Zagan, I mean Lord Mathias….are you being serious?”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“Obviously. I won’t joke on such matters. In fact, all my products have been verified by Satan Beelzebub as well as Euclid Lucifuge, the Vice President of the Devil’s Scientific Research and Development Department. They pose no threat to the health of Devils and are completely safe too.”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“Mathias, please tell us more.”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“Hmm, let’s see. Each product is ranked to match the ideal level of the consumer. It’s based on their strength and will provide their maximum effect in those ranges only. Just eating the products won’t bring out the full effects. To get the best of my products, one has to train and exert their bodies too. Remember, they boost the growth rates.”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“And the prices?\"</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>\"I will try to keep the prices as affordable as possible. The normal, unranked food products will be priced at the same price as in other parts of the underworld more or less. The Ranked products will vary in their prices according to their ranks. I mean, you can understand such crops are not easy to grow and thus their prices will be a bit higher than others.\"</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>\"That's… understandable. Would you tell us a bit more about how and when we can buy your products?\"</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“I will be opening my outlets in several parts of the Underworld. In major cities like the Capital, New Lilith as well as the four Satan cities, my own territories and a few other territories at the start and slowly expand out to the whole Underworld.”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“May I ask which territories?”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“The houses we have made contracts regarding the sales and distribution of our products. For now they include the Gremory, the Astaroth, the Sitri, the Glasya-Labolas, the Lucifuge as of now. We hope to make it to a dozen or so territories by the end of a year. Unranked to D Ranked Products will be sold at the outlets. C Ranked Products will need to be preordered and B Ranked Products will be sold at auctions.”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“Excuse me? Can you please elaborate?”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“Sure. Unranked to D Ranked Products which are meant for High Class Devils can be grown at regular intervals whereas C Ranked products are hard to grow. They take more time and investment and thus their supply will be far less. For this reason, they have to be booked in advance and in limited quantities to avoid someone hoarding it. As for B Ranked products, then we are all aware that there are not many Devils of that rank in the Underworld. The growth of the Devil race stops at that rank and any increase in power however small takes years. So, we would all agree that anything which can provide even a slight increase in power at such a level is priceless and thus the auction for the B Ranked Products.”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>\"So you are saying that your products can work even on Satan Class devils?\"</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>\"Yes. They do. It has already been tested.\"</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>\"And when can we get them from?\"</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>\"Tomorrow.\"</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>\"In that case I would like to book some of them for myself too. Do I get a discount?\"</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>\"Hahahaha why not. But you have to join my territory. The residents of my territory will get a 20% discount on F Ranked products and a 10% discount on E Ranked products. If they join the service of any of my houses, they can get a 5% discount on even the D Ranked products. Moreover, my residents will be given precedence. They in turn will have to sign a contract to stay in my territory for fifty years initially.\"</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>\"Oh, quite sly of you. Attracting people to your territory in such a way.\"</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>\"I will take that as a compliment. Reviving a territory as big as mine is not an easy task. I have to do what I can to succeed.\"</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>\"This reminds me, you had gifted your fiance, Miss Rias, a fruit liked by Satan Leviathan. It had caused quite a sensation. Could it be that it was grown by you too?”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“Yes. It was in fact grown by me. It’s called a Vanilove Fruit and is a C Ranked Product. It has to be pre-booked.”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“Wonderful. Lady Leviathan had bought all those fruits back then and none of them could be passed around. I am sure many houses with demonic beast heritages will be overjoyed at this news too. By the way, on the topic of reviving the Buné and Zagan territories, from what we know, the Buné territory is overrun by the Demonic Beasts from the nearby Pit. What do you plan on doing about that? I am sure it will be a major hurdle in reviving your territory.”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“Correction. The Buné territory was overrun by Demonic Beasts. They have all been hunted down. I collaborated with the Satans and their peerages to clean the area. During the Naberius incident, they had experimented on some demonic beasts which had caused them to mutate and become stronger, causing severe damage to the nearby areas. The Satans compensated me from the fines received from the Naberius House and everyone involved in those incidents and we cleaned the area to assure the safety of the two territories. The current Buné and Zagan territories don’t have any Demonic Beasts outside the Pits.”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“What!”</em></p><p><br></p><p>With this the populations from other areas will surely be attracted to the Buné and Zagan territories.</p><p><br></p><p>The only thing left would be to provide them with jobs but that is already on the way with the alliances they have planned.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“Shall we move on to some juicy gossip now?”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“Hmm?”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“Your engagement with the former Heiress of the Gremory House, Miss Rias Gremory and the princess of the Astaroth House, Latia Astaroth was announced along with your Lordships. It has broken the hearts of many which I am sure you are aware of. You fought a battle against one of them today after all.”</em>  Naud Gaimin laughed.<em> “But that has also caused many Houses to lose the opportunity to form a relationship with your houses. Do you think things could have been different if you have had access to different houses in the last few years instead of just those related to the Satans?”</em></p><p><br></p><p>She narrowed her eyes at the question. She had known that such questions would be raised regardless of the situation but still… it annoyed her more than she had expected.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Mathias however laughed. “No. I highly doubt things could have been different. First of all let me clear out a few things. I was not restricted by the Satans in any way at all. They provided me with assistance but have never forced anything on me. In fact, not even their families knew about my identity bar from a few of my choices. As for how I chose the people to reveal myself to? Simple, I revealed myself to anyone who had talked nicely to me for a month.”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>….</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>….</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>….</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>….</em></p><p><br></p><p>The stunned look on the faces of the people as well as the host was a sight to see.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe this would remind them of how they had treated Mathias all this time before they tried to play the blame game on anyone else.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“Hahahaha are you really that surprised? But this is the truth. I have attended every gathering and party I was invited to.  I even sent invitations to every Pillar House as well as Extra Demons to important occasions of the Buné and Zagan Houses like the final rites of my parents and in doing so, I talked with anyone who talked with me. If we got along well, I revealed my identity to them. It’s just that simple. So please, think twice before blaming anyone. Secondly, the decision of the engagement was totally my fiances’ and mine. Their families had just supported us as we took our time getting to know each other first before deciding to sign the contract. In fact, I was the one who proposed it. If in doing so I couldn’t meet someone else who might have been more compatible with me, a fact I seriously doubt, then we were just not fated.”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“That’s… will you be taking any other wives or concubines… to revive your houses?”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“I have just entered into an engagement contract with two very beautiful and lovely girls. I would like to take some time to get used to it before I think about more.”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“Oh, you three seem to have a very good relationship. My congratulations.”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“Thank you.”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“Lastly, as the Lord of the Duke Buné and King Zagan Houses, you must understand that you command quite a bit of power, so, what is it that you wish to do going forward?”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“Hmm, right now I have my hands full restoring my territories and the names of Duke Buné and King Zagan. When I am done with it, I will concentrate on my farm to make the Underworld completely independent of any kind of food imports and make it self sustainable. I do not wish for anyone to go hungry in the Underworld… ever.”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“That’s quite a great goal. I sincerely wish you can achieve it to bring about the rise of our race.”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“I hope so too.”</em> Mathias replied as they got up, ending the interview.</p><p><br></p><p>She and the rest got up as well.</p><p><br></p><p>Mathias had done his turn, now it was their turn to get the business of the House.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Azazel -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He watched the news broadcast end as the newly ascended, Lord Mathias Buné Zagan completed his interview.</p><p><br></p><p>Zagan.</p><p><br></p><p>They had really thought that name was extinct.</p><p><br></p><p>He still remembered the times of the Great War.</p><p><br></p><p>The overall threat assessment of the first Zagan was second only to one other devil… their brother and the creator of the Devil Race, Lucifer himself.</p><p><br></p><p>His ability to create hoards of demonic beasts, although mindless, was assessed as the most dangerous ability, so much so that even Father decided to send Saraqael of all his sons to take him down.</p><p><br></p><p>And even after the death of the first Zagan, they hadn’t forgotten the fact that he had taken down Saraqael with him as well as the danger such a power could possess if it surfaces again and thus, they had hunted down the Zagan descendants using every possible means necessary, going as far as to team up with Angels and church to do so.</p><p><br></p><p>Their efforts had shown results as well when the Zagan name had all but disappeared from the records of the Underworld as a whole… but it seems there were survivors.</p><p><br></p><p>Mathias Buné Zagan.</p><p><br></p><p>He had ordered the records of his first Rating Game to be brought as soon as he found out about his name and the guy confirmed his fears. He could indeed use Life Magic.</p><p><br></p><p>Being drowned by sheer numbers.</p><p><br></p><p>Neither Rüdiger Rosenkreutz nor Riser Phenex had truly understood the horrors of Life Magic or he would have started to bombard the area from a distance till he exhausted his Demonic Power and then run for his life rather than stand there and throw dialogues.</p><p><br></p><p>Those fools.</p><p><br></p><p>And it would seem that this Zagan was far more dangerous in a completely different way if he could make food like that along with the Demonic Beasts.</p><p><br></p><p>Too bad, neither the Grigori nor Heaven can afford another Archangel to go after him… not to mention the fact that he was related to those two monsters through their sisters. Even laying a finger on him would most likely start a war.</p><p><br></p><p>And even if that were not the case, then the Grigori currently had no free hands to spare after the mess caused by Satanael. If he were to make any moves now, he would earn the ire of the other factions as well.</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t fail to notice that he had the former Suzaku Himejima in his peerage and matched with the fact that his little fiance had Baraqiel’s daughter in her peerage, it would be hurting his brother as well, causing their already sour relationship to break beyond repair.</p><p><br></p><p>Really, those four brats had checkmated everyone with this move.</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am back with another chapter of ‘The Farmer’.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Now, I am sure that many people were excited about Mathias’ power reveal but Riser wasn’t exactly strong enough to force him.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Matty will get the opportunity later on.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>For now, the strength he has shown is enough.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Next chapter will contain the reactions of all other parties to Mathias’ existence and his powers.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>We will also see how things are going on the other side and how Mathias expands and establishes his own territory and maybe some development with other girls.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br><br></p>",

Not that I didn’t know, Leila had made sure I remembered the names of all the main house members of all the Pillar families and what business they did, but I didn’t know the details as clear as Latia who had invested a great deal of time to investigate all of this.</p><p><br></p><p>“Matty, the one coming now are the heads of the Shax and Amy houses. They are the ones controlling most of the food based industries in the Underworld right now. They are going to be our main competition. Be careful.” She warned lightly.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked ahead and two men walked towards me with oddly confident gaits.</p><p><br></p><p>I scanned them and sure enough, they were Albus Amy and Markus Shax, the Lords of the Amy and Shax Houses respectively.</p><p><br></p><p>“Lord Zagan, congratulations on reviving your house.\" Albus Amy congratulated me.</p><p><br></p><p>\"It's good to have you among us.\" Markus Shax followed.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Thank you. I hope you are enjoying the party.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Your party is wonderful. Especially the food which was served. I have to say that I have never tasted anything like this before. Am I right to assume that you will be expanding in the food industry.\"</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled as I used the full power of my Senjutsu to monitor the guy, keeping an eye on all his emotions which was not easy considering he was someone hundreds of years old and as an adept businessman, he had several methods to protect his mind and emotional state being monitored.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Yes. I intend on doing something like that.\" I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>\"In that case, we would like to offer you an exclusive contract for the processing and distribution of your products if you want. As you might know Lord Amy and myself are the leading names in the food business in the Underworld. You would have a much easier time selling your products through us because of our distribution chains.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Exclusive contract… I didn't need to look at Latia or even use Senjutsu to know that she was resisting the urge to roll her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hahahaha why so serious on such a day Lord Shax. Today is a very special day for both me and my House. Too many people have taken time out of their busy schedules and come to congratulate me on this day. If I leave them unattended, I would be a very bad host. So, for today, please enjoy the party. We can talk about business at a later date.\" I diverted the topic.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Lord Zagan…\" He tried to say something but at this time, Mephisto Pheles and his Queen, Tannin, came in, escorted by Euclid, making them stop. He took one look at them and controlled himself from saying anything anymore. \"In that case let's meet at a different date.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Sure, I will contact you.\"</p><p><br></p><p>The two left and Euclid waited till they were gone.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Enjoying yourself, Matty?\" He smirked, making me sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>\"This is annoying.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hahahaha exhausted already? You still have to do this for a thousand years or so.\" The guy with Euclid laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Matty, this is Mephisto Pheles, the Head of the Pheles House as well as the Gauzaburer Magician Organisation and a very good friend of mine. He is the one who coordinates the cases of Pact Magicians with up and coming Devils.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Welcome to my humble place Lord Pheles.\" I greeted with a light bow.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Oh lay off with the formalities. I am a sole demon. So calling me the head of a House is already a bit too much. Just call me Mephisto when we are alone. Euclid has told me a lot about you. To think the new Satans pulled such a fast one on everyone. I would have given half my wealth to see all their faces when they found out, both devils and others.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I am very thankful to them for doing so because I can't imagine being able to bear <em>this</em> for the last few years.\"</p><p><br></p><p>“Understandable. I can’t stand those old devils on the council either. One of the reasons I stay in the human world most of the time. You are welcome to visit me sometimes if you want. Euclid has told me that you are something of a prodigy at magic. The Magicians at Gauzaburer will benefit a lot from seeing you and you can get Pacts from great Magicians. A win-win for both of us. In fact, you would likely get an insane amount of pacts for yourself. The offer goes for you too, Miss Astaroth.” He said the last part looking at Latia.</p><p><br></p><p>She bowed lightly in return.</p><p><br></p><p>“I would love to. In fact, I was searching for a way to teach other kinds of magic to some of my peerage members. They are very interested in magic and I would like to provide them with ideal learning support.”</p><p><br></p><p>I was thinking about letting Valerie and Lavinia learn Magic. The same for Natsume. They were good with it and while I could get them books and guidance from some of the greatest magicians, getting the help of an official Magician Organisation would be helpful.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why not. Bring them over when you have time. Also, I will need a list of your peerage members and their skills, only the ones you want revealed so that the magicians can select whom they want to form Pacts with. This can also be done if you participate in different Rating Games and people can see for themselves what kind of skills they possess. But I guess you will be participating in a Rating Game soon enough.” He said, pointing to the challenge of Riser.</p><p><br></p><p>“I guess I will.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We will be looking forward to seeing you perform. Seriously, it’s been centuries since there has been something interesting like this in the underworld.”</p><p><br></p><p>\"Lord Bunè, do come to my territory sometimes. The kids would love to have you around.\" Tannin also offered.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I would love to. I have heard a lot about your territory and Dragon Apple farms from Tia. If possible then I would like to visit them someday.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hahahaha and the talks of your farm have been heard throughout the Underworld too. By the way Tia is?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Tiamat. She is a good friend and teacher to me.\"</p><p><br></p><p>That caused him to have a reaction.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Tiamat! She took someone as a student?! Now if that isn't the most surprising thing I have heard in a century. Generally she….\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Burns those who annoy her to ashes. Yes I know.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hahahaha yes. So she hasn't changed much since then. I haven't seen her in years. How is she doing?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"She lives nearby and teaches the hatchlings on my ranch. They are a rowdy bunch and she seems to enjoy throwing them through a wringer.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"That does sound fun. I would love to visit your ranch someday. To see the dragon race flourish is always a heartening thing.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"You are welcome to visit my farm. Maybe we can have the younger dragons from both sides play around. My dragons haven't had the opportunity to go outside my farm and would definitely benefit a lot from the contact.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Sounds great. I will get in touch with you soon.\" Tannin assured.</p><p><br></p><p>As we were talking, someone else approached us followed by a few others.</p><p><br></p><p>“Lord Bael, what a surprise to see you here.” Euclid greeted, informing me of his identity in a roundabout way.</p><p><br></p><p>“Lord Lucifuge, Lord Pheles.” he nodded towards them and then turned towards me. “Congratulations on your Lordships, Lord Zagan.”</p><p><br></p><p>… Why does everyone call me only Lord Zagan all of a sudden. It’s like my Buné title got overwritten due to the announcement.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you. I hope you are enjoying the party.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, the party is quite good. I couldn’t come earlier due to some important work but I sent my son, Sairaorg ahead. I hope he informed you.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>This fucking liar.</p><p><br></p><p>He hadn’t talked to Sai in years and now he has the audacity to use him.</p><p><br></p><p>Since he was being such a dick, then…</p><p><br></p><p>As I was thinking of giving him an appropriate reply, I felt a pinch to my side.</p><p><br></p><p>Latia minutely shook her head asking me not to cause any scenes here. Not that I was going to do anything. Sai was still underaged and thus under the control of the Bael House. Even if they couldn’t do anything to me, they could make his and his sick mother’s life a lot more difficult.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Yes. He did.\" I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Good. You will be joining us in the council soon as the Head of two houses. I would like to invite you to the Great King alliance.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Again.</p><p><br></p><p>This was the fifth time already.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hahahaha thank you for the invitation, Lord Bael but today is a special day. Let's take this opportunity to relax. As for politics and alliances, we have thousands of years to worry about that. Let's talk about it at a later date.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"We are the biggest alliance in the Underworld with the most well developed network. You would have a great backing if you join us.\" One of his lackeys said, while the man himself didn't bother speaking.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I am not really familiar with the factions in the Underworld beyond the surface level. This is a very important decision for both me and my Houses, and so, I would like to take my time to get to know everything before I make such an important decision.\"</p><p><br></p><p> I replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“In that case we hope you will choose wisely. As you have said, this involves the future of your house. I apologise but I will have to leave early today due to some urgent work.” Lord Bael replied in words which could be considered as both considerate as well as a thinly veiled threat.</p><p><br></p><p>I merely smiled in reply. “I will. Thank you for coming to the party.”</p><p><br></p><p>They left together, his lackeys with frowns on their faces.</p><p><br></p><p>“Quite gutsy of you to reject their offer like that. They are normally known to get their way through one means or another.” Mephisto said.</p><p><br></p><p>I shrugged. “They are looking for a politician and I am but a simple farmer. It will take me some time to get used to all of this. They should know, after all they hadn’t stopped reminding me of this fact for the last six years.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And you don’t care about politics?”</p><p><br></p><p>“To be honest, as long as they don’t bother me, I couldn’t care if they choke on their morning tea and pass away. But then again, there is hardly anything they could do to me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“They could stop your products from selling in the territories of their alliance members.” Mephisto argued.</p><p><br></p><p>I gave him a smile. “Then I will comply and never sell any products in their territories. You forget something very simple Mephisto… I have lived without the luxuries, farming in these lands and reaching here from nothing. I don't care if I earn a little less money or if they call me names. If they don't allow my products to be sold in their territories, I will simply not sell any to them. My farm has enough animals to use it all.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hahahaha, that is something which they would never expect, someone with no ambitions to make it big in the Underworlds politics.\"</p><p><br></p><p>I shrugged. “Well, at least until they sign a contract to pay me 20 times the price for the next hundred years for my produce.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Euclid had a look of horror on his face. “Don’t be hasty, Matty.”</p><p><br></p><p>I couldn’t hold it any longer and burst out laughing. “I am just joking. No need to get so serious…” He relaxed and I added, “I would just ask for five times at best.”</p><p><br></p><p>He sighed. “Your jokes can give me heart attacks. I will be honest, while we don’t want you to side with them for the balance of the Underworld’s political scenario, you shouldn’t fight with them either. As for any trouble they cause, leave them to us.”</p><p><br></p><p>Mephisto looked at the exchange between me and Euclid with interest. “So you both really think he could force them to buy his products even at twenty times the price?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s just a conservative estimate.” Euclid shrugged. “They wouldn’t have any choice.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hoh? Now I am interested in these products too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Please feel free to give the food a taste. I am quite confident in my products.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Than I will and I will also look forward to your future, young man.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Venelana Gremory -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“He handled it quite well. Standing his ground while not denying them outright. Those people can be quite pushy.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Standing his ground was never a problem for Mathias. What we were worried about was that he would say something like, ‘No thank you, you suck.’ Mathias doesn’t have a good impression of Lord Bael and the Bael house in general due to their treatment of Sairaorg whom he considers a little brother.” Leila explained and she sighed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, I have heard of it. They overdid it there with the kid. But still, would he really say something like that to his face?” Chysis asked, doubtful.</p><p><br></p><p>She laughed. “Let alone Lord Bael, Mathias is someone who could say those words if Zekram was in front of him.”</p><p><br></p><p>Leila scoffed. “Zekram? I have no doubt he would say those words even if the Dragon of Dreams was in front of him.”</p><p><br></p><p>“At least he’s learning. He didn’t decline when Lord Bael lied using Sai’s name.” She pointed out.</p><p><br></p><p>“Probably to keep Sairaorg out of the line of fire.” Leila concluded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Buné was also like that. Stubborn to the core. Zagan on the other hand was more of a shut in scientist. The boy seems to have gotten both of their characteristics. Although he is more likeable than either of them.” The first Gremory stated.</p><p><br></p><p>“Was the first Zagan anything like Mathias… I mean in terms of power?” She asked something which had been in her mind since the start.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will have to see his creations for myself but if the words said by Chysis and Zeo were anything to go by, then I doubt it because then… one Archangel wouldn’t have been enough. There is a high chance that the boy is similar to Sirzechs.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then it really was like that. We were never able to say anything for sure because none of us knew about the actual skills of the first Zagan.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Zagan was not exactly a frontline fighter. One of his fatal weaknesses and the reason he was close to Buné apart from his straight forward nature was that he used to fight in the front lines and allow Zagan to work as he wanted, all the while defending him from enemies. They were a good team. Apart from Barbatos, Buné was the strongest physical fighter. A child between the two houses would have been born would have covered the weaknesses of either side.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, that seems to be the case.”</p><p><br></p><p>The party was almost over and Mathias had bid farewell to most of the guests so they went ahead to meet him.</p><p><br></p><p>The only ones left were Lord Vapula, Lord Agares and his family, Euclid, Mephisto Peheles and his Queen, the Dragon King Tannin. and the families and peerages of the Satans except Astaroth. Lord Phenex had left after his talk with Zeo and Mathias.</p><p><br></p><p>Mathias was planning to attract Archduke Agares to his side as a political backer with a tour of his farm.</p><p><br></p><p>The man had already been given a rough idea by his younger brother and Latia’s father about what to expect there.</p><p><br></p><p>He was talking to Lord Vapula with Sairaorg acting as a link between them.</p><p><br></p><p>Poor man had asked to take in the boy several times since Misla fell sick but was denied. It was even more hopeless because Misla herself couldn’t even say anything due to being in a coma.</p><p><br></p><p>He had since then distanced himself from the Bael and there had been talks of him meeting Archduke Agares.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure you want that? One of the main reasons our House was given the area was to defend against it?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am sure.  But let’s talk about it at a later date.”</p><p><br></p><p>“In that case, please allow me to be your host next time.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That sounds wonderful.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You should come with him too, Sai. It’s been a long time since you have been to the Vapula estate.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes uncle.”</p><p><br></p><p>They reached there just as Lord Vapula was leaving.</p><p><br></p><p>Armin on the other hand looked strangely at Mathias. “You really are crazy, Matty.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hey! This is just a future investment.” He retaliated.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is a future investment?” Leila asked as they reached there.</p><p><br></p><p>The two boys turned towards them and Mathias answered with a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>“I just made a deal to buy off the Vapula territory around Pit number 12. Lord Vapula thought I was doing him a favour since he had to expend a lot of resources to maintain an army to keep the Demonic Beasts at bay so he offered me an official alliance between the two houses as well as compensation in return. The exchange will take place a few years from now so that I have time to work on my territory.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You bought a Pit from Vapula?” Runeas exclaimed. “Are you drunk?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am not of age to drink alcohol yet, so totally sober.”</p><p><br></p><p>She shook her head with a smile. “You’re really planning to do that, aren’t you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yup. In fact, the other Houses which defend the Pits would probably not sell me those lands in a few years after they see what I do with them so I plan to buy all those lands at once and work on them. Most people don’t realise the treasure trove they are leaving unexploited.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s not that they don’t realise it. Most people don’t have the means to harness any of those resources. You should also only take so much work at once.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Aright alright, enough of the boring things. Show me the camels. We have a bet to decide and I am not about to let you back out.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha sure, why not. Would you be joining us too?” He asked the rest and everyone agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure. It’s been two years since I’ve seen your farm. I want to see how much things have changed.”</p><p><br></p><p>They were led inside and the same Dryads who had greeted them back then were called.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is that you, Rose? You look even more beautiful than before.” She greeted the Dryad who had escorted them the last time.</p><p><br></p><p>Rose bowed in front of them. “Welcome to our farm.”</p><p><br></p><p>“She seems a lot more intelligent than the last time I had seen her.” She asked Mathias.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Shizuka has been teaching them etiquette and Lavinia has been teaching them along with Valerie and Gasper. They are like kids in a way so they take the lessons very well.” He explained. “The insane amount of food from our hunts helped them grow too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“... you really fed those demonic beasts…” She asked exasperatedly.</p><p><br></p><p>Latia sighed beside him. “I had tougher negotiations about that with him than I had with Lord Falbium about the price of the Demonic Beast corpses.”</p><p><br></p><p>“This is an investment, just a different type than economic ones.” Mathias shrugged, making her roll her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>But she did sense a sense of teamwork and harmony developing between the two.</p><p><br></p><p>They were realising their roles in the relationship and working with each other to use their talents and cover for the other side’s weakness.</p><p><br></p><p>It seems she will have to teach Rias something to contribute to this relationship too.</p><p><br></p><p>They were led through the same route as the last time but the area had expanded and changed a lot in the last two years.</p><p><br></p><p>“You made another one of those Trees?” Euclid asked, looking at another one of those magnificent Water Trees.</p><p><br></p><p>She still felt awe when standing in front of these wonders of the world.</p><p><br></p><p>“I was making an aquatic area for some animals. We needed more water. This one gives out salt water to support marine lifeforms unlike the last one which gave out fresh water.” He explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“We are planning to plant a few dozen of these and make a sea in the Underworld. The first one of its kind.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A sea?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. The Underworld doesn’t have any large water bodies, let alone seas and oceans. Most of the Devils haven’t seen one because they cannot go to the Human World so easily, so… we are going to make one for them in the Underworld.” He explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“It will also attract a large number of people and provide a source of income for the people who move into our territory.” Latia added.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes yes, imagine having to go to the human world just to see a beach? How is that fair to the kids of the Underworld?”</p><p><br></p><p>That’s… actually a mind blowing idea.</p><p><br></p><p>Even above the top of her head, she could think of over a dozen industries which can be opened to use this.</p><p><br></p><p>“As crazy as it sounds, I can see it working.” Leila mused.</p><p><br></p><p>She could see the minds of the Lords working at this…</p><p><br></p><p>They were led to the Ranch directly this time around.</p><p><br></p><p>“The wards around these places are wonderful.” Lord Agares praised.</p><p><br></p><p>“They are. The only places rivalling these wards in the whole Underworld are the offices of the Satans.” Euclid answered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Were these made by Lord Beelzebub to protect the resources?”</p><p><br></p><p>“This was all done by Mathias himself.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Really! These wards? You can make such wards at such a young age?” Mephisto asked, surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>“I actually made those around a few years ago and only strengthened them two years ago. My Ranch has a lot of my creations as well as my dragons. They can be a bit rowdy when they play so this many wards were needed and since I didn’t have enough funds to hire someone, I learned it myself.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Learned it himself since he didn’t have funds, he says. I have seen people spending their entire lives in ward making and still not get here. I would have not doubt him to be the child of a Dantalion with an affinity to Space if I didn’t know better and even they didn’t reach this kind of level.” Mephisto laughed. “You will probably break the highest number of requests for a pact.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The highest number of what?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s a record of which Devil has been the most requested by Magicians to form a pact with. The current record holder is Ajuka followed by Euclid and McGregor. The top three has never changed since the start. Rudiger and Diehauser did come close but never exactly surpassed McGregor, let alone the other two.” Mephisto explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh… sounds troublesome. Too many people bothering me was never my idea of fun.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A good pact magician is very important, Mathias. Their contributions also count as your contribution to the Devil race and helps increase your rank as well as the name of your house. I have even chosen half of my peerage members from among such magicians.” Euclid explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“... I will keep that in mind.”</p><p><br></p><p>Soon enough they reached the lake where the animals of the ranch drank.</p><p><br></p><p>The Peaceful Flowers make the whole scene look serene.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is… amazing. I wonder if the Gardens of Eden look similar to this?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are those?” Tannin asked, pointing towards a group of dragons.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Those are my dragons. These ones must have come here to drink water. The dragon ranch is further away.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t think I have seen some of those species. What kind of dragons are those?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Those are Amber Dragons, Deep Sea Dragons and Nature Dragons. They are all new varieties of dragons.”</p><p><br></p><p>“New… you mean you made them?” Tannin asked, looking completely shocked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Kinda yes. They were made from a different method so in a way they are the same as natural dragons. I only shaped them or rather wished their forms to go in a certain direction. Even I don’t have a control on what and how they develop. I can make a copy of their eggs though but even that’s hard.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That should be impossible. No one has been able to figure out how exactly Dragons are made. The only thing we know is that the ones born from Nature are masses of magical power. Even I was born of a Fire Dragon and an Earth Dragon.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And I am telling you that I don’t create them per say. I just shape the energy in a certain direction and let it do its work.” He replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“Can I… if I am not being invasive, can I see them?” Tannin asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure. Why not? Poppy, please show him around the Dragon farm.”</p><p><br></p><p>A Dryad appeared beside him.</p><p><br></p><p>It was the nineteenth Ultimate Class Dryad she had seen.</p><p><br></p><p>The Dryad accompanied Tannin as he approached the dragons.</p><p><br></p><p>None of them even reacted at his arrival.</p><p><br></p><p>“Those dragons are quite well trained. Normally dragons get very defensive when someone, especially another dragon approaches them.” Mehisto said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Or maybe they are just more tame.” Lord Sitri suggested.</p><p><br></p><p>“The Nature Dragon is quite peaceful. The other two on the other hand…” Armin shook his head. “The Deep Sea dragon often causes floods in the surrounding areas while the Amber Dragon is quite easy to anger. They are among the troublesome kids. The reason they are so quiet are the flowers growing in the area. The Peaceful Flowers release a scent which pacifies anyone in the area. It’s the reason why all the animals are so peaceful here.” He explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hey hey, where are the ones you told me about?” Runeas interrupted. She had been excited about seeing other camels.</p><p><br></p><p>“Just a bit away.”</p><p><br></p><p>The crowd was led towards another dimension connected to the place.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is it… a desert? You made another dimension to create a desert?” Euclid asked, looking around.</p><p><br></p><p>“I did. It was the best way to get animals of different biomes so close. By the way, everyone please be careful and walk on the sides of the desert. This place has an unusual gravity. It increases the more someone goes towards the centre. So it would be better if we walked on the sides.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Gravity?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I made this place to train for me and my dragons. The gravity helps a lot.”</p><p><br></p><p>“How much higher does it go?” Falbium asked.</p><p><br></p><p>It was Ajuka who answered. “Two hundred times normal gravity at the centre of the desert.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Two hundred?! Even Ultimate Class Devils would get crushed at such gravity let alone High Class ones.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The bodies of dragons are different from Devils. They can take a lot of punishment. We all train near the border areas of the desert around 10 times gravity. Anyways, we are there. Look ahead.”</p><p><br></p><p>They did and saw the strangest kind of creatures in front of them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is that?”</p><p><br></p><p>“They are called Custard Camels. They produce Custard from their humps.” Mathias turned towards the flabbergasted Runeas Gremory. “So, have you seen this kind of Camel before?”</p><p><br></p><p>The other Lords were still confused about her identity. Only the Satans had knowledge of her.</p><p><br></p><p>The only other person who knew her laughed. “You and your Camel fetish.” Mephisto shook his head but the one in question wasn’t even paying attention to it.</p><p><br></p><p>“Can we eat the custard?” Runeas turned towards Mathias and asked.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact she wanted to know the answer too.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Mathias -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Yup. This custard is an absolute delicacy. In fact, they are extremely nutritious and have no side effects on the body either. I even served it as a dish today.” Seeing her stunned, I continued. “There is also a Camel called the Water Camel which can store around two thousand litres of water in its hump and a variant of it… the Wine Camel which can produce high quality wine in its hump on par with the best fruit wines.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It can produce wines?” Septus asked, suddenly interested.</p><p><br></p><p>He was planning on opening a winery using my fruits.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. The quality and taste of the wine depends on the breed and gender of the camels so they have some variations too. They can be milked out the same way we milk a cow.” I explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“Of course, why go through the process of making a winery when you can make animals which make wine directly.” He rolled his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“To be honest, there are other wines on the farm too with the best ones being on the back of an Ultimate Class dragon made up of emeralds.” I laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>Leaving the dumbfounded crowd aside, Runeas jumped in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, you win. But I want to buy two of the calves of these camels for my hoard.”</p><p><br></p><p>This caused the attention of several people to shift towards her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Lord Gremory, this is?” Lord Agares asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I’m Runeas Gremory, the founder of the Gremory House. Now stay quiet for a moment. We have a once in a millenia deal going on here.”</p><p><br></p><p>Poor Lord Agares was about to say something but then his mind registered the introduction and he forced himself to stop at the right time, staring wide-eyed at her and then at Zeoticus.</p><p><br></p><p>The man answered his doubts with a nod.</p><p><br></p><p>All the Lords bowed and greeted her while she remained focused on my answer.</p><p><br></p><p>“Actually, I was going to gift them to Zeoticus for his birthday in three months but sure, I can get a few calves for you if it’s just these few animals.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha that’s good. I like you kid.” She laughed and went dancing towards the Camels completely ignoring the surroundings.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>She was a total brat.</p><p><br></p><p>They all left to have a tour of the farm with my dryads while my fiances, my peerage members and I went back to discuss other matters.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“You must beat him up in the Rating Game, Matty. That idiot…” Rias said angrily.</p><p><br></p><p>With us being on our own, she didn’t have to keep her princess facade up and could behave as she wanted to.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Alright, calm down. The guy is just throwing a tantrum because he was heartbroken. Let it be. He didn't harm anyone.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"But it was your debut and he made a mess of things. It was all going perfectly and he had to mess everything up.\" Rias pointed.</p><p><br></p><p>She was extremely angry at Riser due to the little tantrum he threw.</p><p><br></p><p>His brother, Ruval came and apologised for him personally and then there was that talk with Lord Phenex, so I wasn't exactly mad about it but it was the breaking point for Rias who has been annoyed at him for a while.</p><p><br></p><p>\"He didn't exactly mess anything up. If anything, what he did will only make Mathias look good. Mathias not only defended your honour but also took on his challenge. Everything depends on how the matter is published. And as for the publicity, I have already taken care of it.\" Latia said, looking unusually calm… which was not a good thing if I knew her at all.</p><p><br></p><p>\"What did you do?\" I asked, slightly suspiciously.</p><p><br></p><p>She rolled her eyes at my question. \"Don't worry. The Phenex House is a great client as well as a major competitor for us. I won't do anything which would cause unnecessary friction between us, especially due to the actions of one person. I just made sure you get proper coverage and a positive kind of publicity. In return, we will have to appear for an interview with the Gamigins on Naud Gamigin's show before we appear anywhere else for a public interview.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"What public interview?\" I asked, completely distracted at the mention of something extremely troublesome.</p><p><br></p><p>\"The Underworld will want to know the new Lord of House Bunè. Not to mention for you who wants to start a business as well as attract people to his territory, you will need to appear publicly and spread the information about your territory. Many different things are involved in making a territory. Your farm is the business of the Buné and Zagan Houses but your people will also need businesses which will attract them here. You will also need subordinates to run the basic government in your territory. I think mother has already told you about it.”</p><p><br></p><p>With each word she said, I felt a metaphorical arrow hit me.</p><p><br></p><p>“And all of this requires you to appear frequently in front of the public, have a good public image and enough funds.”</p><p><br></p><p>I sat down after the continuous attacks of my future to-do-list. It’s not like Leila hadn’t coached me on it already.</p><p><br></p><p>But even thinking about it was annoying.</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t have to worry about it now. Just concentrate on the Rating Game. Make sure you win in a flashy way. It will help us in the future.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That… I can do.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes yes. Blow his face off. Don’t worry. He can regenerate.”</p><p><br></p><p>The last part cracked us up. I pulled both the girls into a hug while laughing.</p><p><br></p><p>We had some free time after everyone had left today.</p><p><br></p><p>The tutorial period of my life was done. It was time to enter the game completely.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Tannin -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“What do you think of the new Lord, Tannin?” Mephisto asked him.</p><p><br></p><p>The question reminded him of what he had seen on the farm.</p><p><br></p><p>Over two hundred dragons of varieties he had never seen before and several hundred dragons of the known variety.</p><p><br></p><p>The young ones were taken care of by Dryads and protected by the old ones.</p><p><br></p><p>It was like a closed paradise for Dragons and he didn’t even know it existed.</p><p><br></p><p>“There were over a thousand dragons, old and young, in the farm. They all lived and grew up together. There was even an arena for them to fight and entire ecosystems to hunt from. The young ones were raised by Dryads and while the old ones fought among themselves, they never once exhibited any hostility towards any hatchlings. All of them were well trained. He was able to maintain all of that, by himself, which shows he is extremely talented. And the less we say about his abilities with the Zagan Trait, the better. No wonder Tiamat had taken a personal interest in the boy.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well that was obvious or else the Satans wouldn’t have risked so much to pull a fast one like that over the whole underworld. Euclid seemed quite close to the boy too. What is your opinion about him? Should we come out as his supporters?”</p><p><br></p><p>He sighed. “After seeing his ability to create dragons, it was a moot point. I was going to support him either way. But the boy himself was quite humble unlike most of the other kids his age. It makes it easier for me to make the decision.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I guess it’s decided then. Between those stuck up pricks in the council and the current Satans, it was always an easy choice. And now they have added such a game changer on their side too. I guess I will have fun in the coming days.”</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, how was your meeting with Azazel?” Tannin asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Mephisto let out a sigh. “Azazel is still putting out the fires spread by the rebel cadre Satanael.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The matter escalated that much due to the foolishness of the Principal Clans and the Shinto Gods in the first place. A good thing will be that they won’t have the power to pay any attention to the reveal of Mathias.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I… wouldn't be so sure of that. You might not have recognised her but Mathias’ rook… she was the former host of the Vermillion Bird. Not only that but the Queen of the Gremory girl was the daughter of Baraqiel.”</p><p><br></p><p>“She was? I thought the girl was a dragon and I don’t know why but she reminded me of someone. I just can’t remember who.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Dragon? Strange. Anyways, what are your plans now?” Mephisto asked him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Me? I will take some of the young ones to his farm. He grows some fruits specifically for Dragons so maybe make a deal with him for it. But all of that will happen after the Rating Game.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah yes. The Rating Game. The Phenex child might not be lucky this time.”</p><p><br></p><p>“He won’t. Call it my instinct but Mathias Buné Zagan… was hiding far more than we had seen.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! In that case, let’s book a ticket for the Game, shall we? The sudden reveal of his Zagan heritage has suddenly made the tickets a hotseller. Maybe we can even bet around this time.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Maybe, I will.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Zeoticus Gremory -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He sat finally with his family to take a moment of rest.</p><p><br></p><p>The news about the reveal of Mathias and Rias being engaged to him was just as big as he was expecting.</p><p><br></p><p>Then he had to make the official proceedings to remove Rias from the position of the Heiress and pass on the heirship to Milicas.</p><p><br></p><p>He will have to make an announcement soon enough.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe the only reprieve was the fact that they still had no idea about just how big of a deal he was… well, apart from the ones who had a tour of the farm.</p><p><br></p><p>That will change soon through.</p><p><br></p><p>But at least they will be prepared for such an event.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tired?” His wife asked him as he sat down, bringing out a wine bottle and pouring a glass for him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. That boy keeps dropping one shocking thing after another on everyone. A sea of all things in the Underworld! Not even the Leviathan can claim to be able to do so.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hehehehe it’s good, isn’t it? At least he keeps things entertaining.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That he does. Lord Sitri is going to make a contract with him for collaborating with the Sitri Hospitals. His products could completely revolutionise the entire Medical System of the Underworld. And little Latia would probably squeeze him for every bit of profit she can.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s good that she is there to keep an eye on Mathias. What about the other side?”</p><p><br></p><p>He let out a sigh. “They haven’t made any moves. Maybe they are waiting to see how he responds to their invitation.”</p><p><br></p><p>“He is not exactly going to accept their invitation from what I know about him. Because even if he does, he will leave in a year. They are just not compatible.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I know. Sirzechs does too. Right now, it would be for the best if he were to remain an independent power because he alone can shift the balance of power in any direction if given a few years. Lord Agares agrees with this too and so he is going to support him with his entire faction to keep him independent.” He answered as he took a sip of the wine. “Hmm, this is new.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s from the Wine Camels. Ancestor was extremely happy with her gift. She took them to her Camel hoard to introduce the new members to the rest of them.”</p><p><br></p><p>He shook his head with a smile. “Yes. She is very fond of her Camels. I remember the last time she was awake was when I was a child. She used to take me to play with them.”</p><p><br></p><p>“She is preparing some kind of return gift for him.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. On the matter of ancestors, yours will be visiting us soon.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We knew it was going to happen the moment we found out about Mathias.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That we did.”</p><p><br></p><p>As they were discussing things, there was a knock on the door.</p><p><br></p><p>It was Rias.</p><p><br></p><p>“Come in.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You called, Mother?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Come sit, Rias.”</p><p><br></p><p>She did and he looked at his wife confused.</p><p><br></p><p>“From today onwards, you are officially engaged to Mathias to be the future Lady Buné.”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“So let’s talk about what you want to do in the future?”</p><p><br></p><p>“What?” Rias asked, confused.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, let’s see it like this. Have you seen the relationship between Latia and Mathias?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. They get along very well. We all get along very well with each other.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And we are very happy with that but I am talking about the future. Latia and Mathias have a very partner-like relationship. They work as a team. Mathias brings forth crazy plans and creations while Latia works to change them into business ideas. She makes sure that he can get the best profit margin from his products. She even went toe to toe with Falbium Asmodeus and your father to get every bit of profit for him and make sure that no one can take advantage of him. You have seen this right?”</p><p><br></p><p>Rias nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“And in return, Mathias trusts her decisions explicitly. He can easily deny any of her decisions if he doesn’t want to do it but he still considers them and most of the time acts according to them because of the trust between them. Both of them have developed a great understanding in this way and this understanding and trust is what makes their relationship so great.”</p><p><br></p><p>By now Rias was listening quietly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Now, the question is… what do you bring into this relationship? Because if you don’t have anything to contribute to it then… later on, you will feel left out even when you are treated the same.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I…” She became quiet, not able to answer anything.</p><p><br></p><p>He wanted to say that she was quite young and still had time but the House she was going to get married into was going to be the centre of many changes. She needed to prepare for it much earlier.</p><p><br></p><p>In this regard, Venelana was doing the right thing,</p><p><br></p><p>“So… what should I do?”</p><p><br></p><p>“You need to pick up something which the two of them lack.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Politics.”</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing her confused look, Venelana explained it further.</p><p><br></p><p>“Politics is an inseparable part of the Pillar Houses. It is the fate we are born with. Especially for someone like Mathias who is the Lord of two houses and is bound to command a huge amount of sway in the policies of the Underworld in the future. Unfortunately, Mathias is almost revolted by the politics and Latia has neither the time nor the interest to focus on politics. This leaves a very big hole in their whole system and this is where you come in. From now on, I will train you in politics. You have a good background for it and with some work, you can cover up the only place where Mathias and Latia lack, becoming a part of the Team.”</p><p><br></p><p>Rias looked to be in thought.</p><p><br></p><p>“What do you say, Rias?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I agree. I… don’t want to be left out. Everyone is working hard. Even Gasper who is just a kid, so I don’t want to slack off either.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Good. Then we will begin your lessons tomorrow. And this time, I will not be holding back. Be prepared.”</p><p><br></p><p>Rias nodded resolutely.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Sirzechs -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Another one of the Lords asking for a meeting?” Serafall asked as he entered the room.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Fifteen of them have contacted me already. Some to verify about the Lordships of Mathias and if the Zagan House was actually back. Everyone is going crazy.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And Zekram?” Falbium asked.</p><p><br></p><p>He shook his head. “There’s nothing from him. Apart from Lord Bael appearing at the party with the invitation, there was nothing else.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Euclid says Mathias didn’t accept their invitation and they left quietly.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Probably want to see more of him before deciding how to proceed. The Rating Game is going to be even more anticipated than Armin’s. It’s kinda lucky he was challenged by Riser who was a genuine new Rating Game player or I am pretty sure he would have encountered a top ten player in his debut Rating Game to beat him down.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Would it change anything? If anything, it would have made him even more famous once his strength came out.”</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, how was the talk between your father and Latia? I heard she was the one who was making the deal about the Medical Supplies.”</p><p><br></p><p>Serafall blanched lightly.</p><p><br></p><p>“She didn’t back down, did she?” Falbium laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Not one bit. That girl convinced Father to sign a contract for a hundred years for a part of the profits of the Sitri Hospital. Her reason was that they could easily open a hospital with the resources they have and it would cut into the profits of both houses as while they could heal injuries, there were very few things they could do about diseases. The Sitri Houses specialised in this aspect. So both the houses would profit more if they combined their best parts. In return, for the next hundred years, they will not be opening any hospitals for people outside his territories and provide us with the equipment. We will also be given the first priority when buying medical supplies to a certain amount every year. It’s hard to believe that she is only two years older than Sona.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I want to ask him to make a dimension with gravity similar to his desert for our soldiers but I dread having to sit in a five hour long meeting, arguing about the price with her. So troublesome.” Falbium shook his head.</p><p><br></p><p>“Apparently, they are making an alliance with Tannin as well.” He added.</p><p><br></p><p>“That guy has dedicated his entire life to the Dragon race. It isn’t a surprise if he does so.” Falbium commented.</p><p><br></p><p>“We have done everything we can for him. Now all we can do is wait and hope for the best.” He said.</p><p><br></p><p>“I wonder if we can bet on the Rating Game again?” Serafall smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>He chuckled too.</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t think they would bet on that.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We never know.” She laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Has the date of the Rating Game been decided?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes… it’s the day after tomorrow. Mathias will be appearing for his first public interview right after that and there is a council meeting to welcome the new Head of the House a week later.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sigh sounds so troublesome.” Falbium yawned before deciding to take a nap.</p><p><br></p><p>And thus was the end of the meeting.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I know many were looking forward to the Rating Game but I wanted to get it done right.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Next chapter will be the Rating Game for sure.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Mathias has finally been revealed and some of them have seen his talents, joining the Buné express.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Latia gets to be the businesswoman everyone is scared of.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Rias will be learning politics from her mother.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Runeas is a happy gal with her camels.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The Underworld is finally going to have a beach of its own.[Beta Note: The Beach Episode is inevitable :D]</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Next episode, the whole world will witness Lord Mathias Buné Zagan for the first time and I will show the reactions of the other factions about him.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br><br><br></p>",

We were inside the Gravity Area of my farm. I had put several barriers around the place to prevent the shockwaves of the spar from going out and alerting anyone else.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure you want to do this?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded. “I want to see how far I can go if I go all out against someone far stronger than me. I want you to fight me seriously.” He said seriously.</p><p><br></p><p>“What brought this on so suddenly?” I asked as I stretched, preparing for the fight.</p><p><br></p><p>“I think I have encountered a limit which normal training cannot help me with. Falbium told me I needed to fight. There are only two options. Either Rating Games or this.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay. So you need me to push you to the limit, right.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, let’s go. But first let me call Valerie with a few Senzu Beans.” And I did just that. If he wanted to break through his limit, getting beaten up only once wouldn’t do.</p><p><br></p><p>He was at B- Rank with his Physique alone.</p><p><br></p><p>Something many wouldn’t achieve in a long time. With just that, he can count himself amongst the strong in this world. But going beyond this rank was extremely hard for each and every sub rank. At least for anyone without a cheat like mine.</p><p><br></p><p>I took a position and beckoned him to attack.</p><p><br></p><p>Armin kicked the ground and shot towards me, several magic circles forming around his hands and he reinforced himself using Reinforcement Magic, a certain something which he had been learning to use recently.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a good move since he could also train his Demonic Power and assimilate it in his combat easily.</p><p><br></p><p>Falbium had a move called Absolute Defense. It was basically a Barrier Technique devised by him which let him reflect damage back to the user.</p><p><br></p><p>Armin wants to use his Barrier Technique and make his own variation to suit his fighting style on his own.</p><p><br></p><p>For this, he has been working quite hard.</p><p><br></p><p>I diverted his attack towards the side, grabbing his wrist and pulling him just to knee his guts. A gasp escaped his mouth but I didn’t give him any respite and elbowed his back, slamming him into the ground, creating a crater all around us.</p><p><br></p><p>The gravity of the area was making the attacks far heavier than normal.</p><p><br></p><p>He wanted to push himself, then so be it.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>Twelve hours and five Senzu Beans later, we sat in the middle of a completely destroyed landscape or more precisely, I was sitting and Armin was laying down on the ground. He was physically fine but mentally exhausted.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you get what you wanted?” I asked as he collected his breath.</p><p><br></p><p>“I think I know what direction I need to take now.” He waited for a second before looking up. \"Just how much were you holding back?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"A bit. Gourmet Cells make a lot of difference. If you can awaken them, it would be a great boost to your power.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"How much?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"What?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"How much more can you go?\" He asked seriously.</p><p><br></p><p>I don't really want to lie to him if possible. It's not a good thing for friendships. So…</p><p><br></p><p>\"Honestly speaking, by the estimates given to me by Tia, I am physically stronger than any Dragon King in this world, almost reaching the level of a Heavenly Dragon should I go all out. But unlike them I could only fight at that level for a short period of time.\"</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at me blankly. \"You really are a monster, aren't you? Heavenly Dragon… Two of them could take on the Three Factions by themselves.\"</p><p><br></p><p>I shrugged. \"They would most likely win with their outrage and their personal magic. Not to mention, they will probably outlast me.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"You do know that people would hound you even more if they find this out.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Why do you think I keep it a secret even from the Satans? They know I am strong just not how much. Sirzechs and Ajuka could most likely kick my butt too.\"</p><p><br></p><p>He rolled his eyes at the comment.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you need more spars like this?” I changed the topic.</p><p><br></p><p>“As much as I would love to make it a monthly thing, let’s keep this kind of spar for once a year.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>He rolled his eyes. “I knew you wouldn’t notice. How much do you think five Senzu Beans cost?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No idea. I haven’t fixed any prices yet. Latia said she needed to do detailed market research for it before any of the stuff could be sold. It seemed to be a good move so I allowed her to do it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank Satans you are getting married to her or I fear what would have happened to the Underworld’s economy. Let me explain it to you in terms of numbers.”</p><p><br></p><p>I raised an eyebrow as he continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“A normal Phenex Tear needs Twenty Five Million Liliums for someone of the Devil’s faction to purchase, higher for other factions. Even then, they are always booked for years, so much so that getting one is hard even for the Satans. Your Senzu Beans not only heal injuries but also restores the user to full strength instantaneously which makes it infinitely more useful than Phenex Tears. Even if we low ball it, it will go for thirty to fifty million Liliums, depending on the supply. You used five of them on me in this spar alone. That’s two hundred and fifty million Liliums.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That much?!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Probably a lot more, I am not big on the business aspect.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Wow.”</p><p><br></p><p>He merely shook his head.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s not tell Latia about this, alright.” I joked.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>And we both burst into a fit of laughter.</p><p><br></p><p>“So what’s the plan from now on?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will participate in the Rating Games after your reveal. It will be a good place to hone my skills.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Some of those people are quite strong. Tannin could probably kick your butt in a physical one on one fight.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Expecting anything less from a former Dragon King would be utter foolishness.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yup. I have heard from Tia that he has become stronger from when he was a Dragon too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. And what about you? Only three days left till the entire Underworld comes after you. How are you feeling right now?”</p><p><br></p><p>“A bit tense, yes. Leila told me that I needed to attend the meetings and Latia is both young and not interested in politics to take my place there. So I will have to push through by myself.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you get any messages from the Satans?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Nope. I want to celebrate my birthday as a private event. Send an invitation to anyone who comes with just my Buné name and see.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A Test, eh.”</p><p><br></p><p>I shrugged. “Those who come to my birthday now will only be those who actually cared or…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Or?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Those who want to meet you as everyone knows you will be coming here.” I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>He deadpanned at the comment.</p><p><br></p><p>“So when are you all planning to reveal the identity?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Two days later, when I celebrate my first Rating Game win. Unlike you, not many people are expecting anything from me so I can make my debut Rating Game later on. This also gives Sirzechs enough time to finalise the documents before anyone tries anything.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Yes. That works as well. You get a few extra days of reprieve too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And what about you and Lilitifa?” I asked with a smirk as he rolled his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“She is a sweet girl and I can see us getting along as a married couple. Although, I don’t know what will happen after Mother is done with her training. I do agree with Mother on this part. She is a bit timid and would be torn apart by others if she remains like that.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Bring her here and let her train sometimes. Getting stronger will do a lot to boost her confidence. She can join Ingvild in her training.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm maybe in a month then?”</p><p><br></p><p>We talked about various things before he decided to retire for the day.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x_________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>Tomorrow was my eighteenth birthday.</p><p><br></p><p>Sectus and Zeoticus had prepared a gift for me in advance.</p><p><br></p><p>My entire Zagan Mansion was reconstructed in a matter of days. </p><p>Till now we lived in the Buné Mansion but with the event of my debut coming near, they decided to reconstruct the Zagan territory too.</p><p><br></p><p>I will need to arrange the security of the whole place and maybe throw in some barriers and reinforce the whole place. At least I can make another farm area centred around this place.</p><p><br></p><p>Today, everyone gathered here to plan for tomorrow’s party.</p><p><br></p><p>We had stayed up late deciding what to do for the guests tomorrow.</p><p><br></p><p>I finally returned to my bedroom after the busy day. It was already midnight so I guess I was eighteen now.</p><p><br></p><p>Yay, happy birthday to me.</p><p><br></p><p>It has been seven years in this world. Things have changed so much.</p><p><br></p><p>The door opened and Lavinia and Ingvild entered the room.</p><p><br></p><p>With a look at each other, they undressed for bed and I looked at them with my mouth open. </p><p><br></p><p>The former had a bright smile on her face while the latter was blushing to her ears. The reason for this was probably the dresses they were wearing… or not wearing.</p><p><br></p><p>Both of them came to my side and hugged me lightly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Happy Birthday, Matty.”</p><p><br></p><p>“H-h-happy Birthday.”</p><p><br></p><p>I finally got the control of my mind back and put a hand around their waists.</p><p><br></p><p>“With a gift like this… obviously.”</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>A gift.</p><p><br></p><p>They were, I don’t know if I can even call it wearing, a thin ribbon all over their bodies, covering only the bare minimum of their bodies with a bow on their chest.</p><p><br></p><p>I grabbed the ribbons and quickly ripped them apart, ready to claim my gift.</p><p><br></p><p>Lavinia giggled while Ingvild yelped in surprise before blushing even more if that was even possible.</p><p><br></p><p>I pulled the shyer of the two into a kiss and she wrapped her hand around my neck while my other hand hugged the other and reached for her peaks, gently caressing them. When we pulled apart, she had a dazed look on her face.</p><p><br></p><p>My hands went to her breasts while my lips touched Lavinia’s who was even more enthusiastic than normal. She got on the top of my lap, her core directly on top of my painfully hard lower half and wrapped her arms around my neck as she made her tongue dance with my own. My hand slipped down her back and grabbed her soft behind, pulling her more towards me.</p><p><br></p><p>She grinded her crotch on my length and kissed me like there was no tomorrow.</p><p><br></p><p>I pushed her on the top of the bed and with a snap of my finger, undressed, rubbing my length directly on her core. With that I started moving. It wasn’t sex but the softness of her thighs and the heat of her core made it incredibly close.</p><p><br></p><p>I want to make their first time special for each one of them… and while a few things could beat a threesome for the first time… I was willing to try.</p><p><br></p><p>She moaned and I realised that Ingvild might be feeling left out so I pulled her in for a kiss, one of my hands going between her legs, caressing her slit while with the other hand I grabbed Lavy’s legs and thrust between her thighs.</p><p><br></p><p>Moans echoed throughout the room and a few minutes later, Ingvild was the first one to achieve her first release. Lavinia was the second and I was the last. I shot my seed all over the two, finally cumming too.</p><p><br></p><p>I guess the first time was too much for the two as they gasped for breath.</p><p><br></p><p>“That was…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Amazing.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It was. Where did you even learn such a thing from?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I-it was in a novel Akeno brought and Valerie suggested. Humans do these kinds of things on birthdays nowadays…” Ingvild said but her voice was getting lighter with every word that she spoke.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Did Valerie tell you that?”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>I turned towards Lavinia.</p><p><br></p><p>“I thought it looked fun.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>First of all I gave a mental thumbs up to Valerie and Akeno.</p><p><br></p><p>Second, I need to clear this misconception of theirs.</p><p><br></p><p>“It was probably a doujinshi or manga of some kind. Humans don’t usually do this kind of thing. And while I am more than flattered, I personally think you all deserve your first time to be something special. If you two still want me to continue, I will.”</p><p><br></p><p>Poor Ingvild took a moment to realise that she was pranked and hid her face in my chest, too embarrassed to even look at my face while Lavinia merely giggled.</p><p><br></p><p>A few moments later though, I heard a mosquito-like whisper. “I would like it to be private between us.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay.” I thought so. The fact that she agreed to something like this was already surprising. But she was doing this because she thought it was not uncommon.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then I want to go on a date.” Lavinia spoke too as she put her head on my chest and snuggled against me again.</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But… it doesn’t look like you are done yet.” She pointed to my lower head which was back in attention once again. </p><p><br></p><p>This time surprisingly, Ingvild took charge, bringing her hand and taking a hold of my length. She took the same position as Lavinia and I did the same to her.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the night, I came three more times before finally controlling myself with light Senjutsu when both the girls fell asleep.</p><p><br></p><p>My stamina was quite high… even in this aspect.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good Night.”</p><p><br></p><p>And Happy Birthday to me.</p><p><br></p><p>________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I woke up the next morning and looked at the Status Screen.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Host: Mathias Buné</strong></p><p><strong>Title: The Poor Noble, Pure Blooded Devil, The Farmer</strong></p><p><strong>Age: 18 years old. </strong></p><p><strong>Body: B+</strong></p><p><strong>Mind: B+</strong></p><p><strong>Spirit: B+</strong></p><p><strong>Magic: B+</strong></p><p><strong>Luck: B+</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Skills:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Buné Clan Trait:</strong></p><p><strong>Dragon Taming: B+</strong></p><p><strong>Dragonification: B+</strong></p><p><strong>Dragonfire: B+</strong></p><p><strong>Dragon's Aura: B+</strong></p><p><strong>Dream Manipulation: B+</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Zagan Clan Trait:</strong></p><p><strong>Life Magic: B+</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Gourmet Cells: C+</strong></p><p><strong>Gourmet Demon: Derous, S+[B-]</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Magic:</strong></p><p><strong>Teleportation: B+</strong></p><p><strong>Bounded Field Creation: B+</strong></p><p><strong>Memory Alteration: B</strong></p><p><strong>Sealing Magic: B+</strong></p><p><strong>Barrier Magic: B+</strong></p><p><strong>Spatial Magic: B+</strong></p><p><br><br></p><p><strong>Martial Arts: B+</strong></p><p><strong>Touki: B+</strong></p><p><strong>Cooking: B+</strong></p><p><strong>Senjutsu: B</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Harvesting C+</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Abnormality Resistance: B+</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Farm Management</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Farm Rank: B</strong></p><p><strong>Farming Points: 4,478,512.</strong></p><p><strong>Money: 221,254,119,000Ⱡ</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Shop</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Inventory</strong></p><p><br></p><p>My stats have been the same for a while. The only difference being the Sealing, Harvesting Skill and the increase in the Gourmet Cells and the age… yes, age.</p><p><br></p><p>I did take some time to learn Sealing Magic and used my Farming Points to boost it to B+ Rank.</p><p><br></p><p>This was a skill which was extremely useful in this world.</p><p><br></p><p>Take the Biblical God for example. The guy was basically an Uzumaki in disguise.</p><p><br></p><p>I was waiting for Venelana and Leila to arrive. Both of them wanted to check the final preparations for my debut party.</p><p><br></p><p>They said that this would be my first appearance as a Lord of the House and as such I couldn’t let down the reputation of my house by missing something which others might criticise.</p><p><br></p><p>Leila offered to give me a hand regarding the staff and Venelana joined in. They selected several staff members to work at my estates.</p><p><br></p><p>I agreed to let the maids and butlers work on the Zagan estate but the Buné estate, which had my farm surrounding it, will only be maintained by my peerage members and my Dryads.</p><p><br></p><p>When my Farm is raised to A Rank, they will be able to grow to B+ Rank and will gain a complete human form.</p><p><br></p><p>Their intelligence will get a very great boost well above a normal human.</p><p><br></p><p>In a year and half, I could make them work as my staff with some training.</p><p><br></p><p>I gave my reasons to them and they agreed. It was decided that I will use the Zagan Territory and Estate to receive guests and hold parties.</p><p><br></p><p>None of this had anything to do with my… aversion with maids. It was done purely for security reasons.</p><p><br></p><p>As I was thinking this, a magic circle lit up in my courtyard and out of them appeared both of my to be mother-in-laws and future wives.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good Morning.” I greeted them</p><p><br></p><p>“Good Morning and Happy Birthday to you, Mathias. Or should I call you Lord Buné Zagan now?” Venelana smiled jokingly.</p><p><br></p><p>I cringed at the title.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will pass on the title. I prefer Matty to it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then Matty it is.” She laughed. “Then lead us in. I can’t wait to see the preparations you have made for today’s debut party.”</p><p><br></p><p>I did just that. “Everyone has been busy arranging everything since morning. I personally did the cooking and put everything under stasis wards. Shizuka actually suggested I should be the one to do so to use this chance to advertise my products to the ones who visit.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A good suggestion. Your rook was the heir to a prestigious clan, if I remember correctly. She must know a lot about conducting business and politics. You should have her study the laws of the Underworld to have someone advise you about politics.” Leila suggested.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at her confused.</p><p><br></p><p>She noticed my look and shook her head. “You have to learn how to do these things yourself. If we guide you often, people will assume that we are merely using you as a puppet to control your houses.”</p><p><br></p><p>I sighed. “Really, these people should do something productive with their free time.”</p><p><br></p><p>“They have too much free time. Thousands of years of lifetime makes sure of that.”</p><p><br></p><p>We reached the mansion where everyone was working under the directions of Shizuka, who was the one most well versed in these kinds of things.</p><p><br></p><p>Armin was filling in the places which she didn’t know about.</p><p><br></p><p>My Dryads were growing or moving plants of different kinds and making flowers bloom on every plant to make the party venue.</p><p><br></p><p>The rest of the work was done by the members of our peerages.</p><p><br></p><p>“The design of the venue is beautiful.” Venelana commented, looking around.</p><p><br></p><p>And it indeed was.</p><p><br></p><p>The design was thought of by Shizuka and made by Ingvild, Lavinia and me.</p><p><br></p><p>Ingvild made an entire lake. She then manipulated the water into giant dragons of different shapes surrounding the whole venue and finally a gigantic Sea Serpent of the End surrounding the dragons.</p><p><br></p><p>Lavinia froze the water figures in their places and I put wards around them to make it so they do not melt.</p><p><br></p><p>I went ahead and put several wards around the statues so that it would take several attacks from an Ultimate Class Devil to completely break the statues.</p><p><br></p><p>We can never be sure that a stuck up brat tries to play a prank and destroys one of the statues, making them collapse on the venue.</p><p><br></p><p>“Shizuka thought a design representing both my houses would be a good idea. The dragons represent Buné and the plants represent the Zagan House.” I explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“A very well thought of idea.” Venelana nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias and Latia went in to join the others while Leila and Venelana pointed out a few things to me.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the top things on our list was my outfit for the day.</p><p><br></p><p>For this, Zeoticus had prepared a custom made suit for me, made from Dragon Hide from an Ultimate Class Dragon.</p><p><br></p><p>By the time it was evening, we were all done with the work.</p><p><br></p><p>Leila and Venelana left to prepare themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>The first ones to arrive were the Lucifuge.</p><p><br></p><p>They more or less knew about me.</p><p><br></p><p>Euclid wished me luck and took his wife and daughter in.</p><p><br></p><p>The next were the Gremorys.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs and his wife with their son Milicas came in first. Zeoticus was escorting a crimson haired lady who looked to be in her twenties and a crimson haired girl with twin tails.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl saw me and jumped up to me. “Is he the boy engaged to Big Sis Rias?” She looked back at Zeoticus and asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Big Sis?</p><p><br></p><p>Is she a cousin or something?</p><p><br></p><p>Rias never told me of any cousin though.</p><p><br></p><p>I took a quick Observe at her.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>[Runeas Gremory]</strong></p><p><strong>[Rank: C+]</strong></p><p><br></p><p>C+?</p><p><br></p><p>I seem to remember the name Runeas from somewhere. It took me a second to remember where though.</p><p><br></p><p>And along with it, I remembered the pictures shown to me during the lessons about the important figures in the Devil History by Leila.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Zeoticus who introduced the woman who was beside him.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Mathias, this is my mother, Chysis Gremory. And this is…\" He tried to introduce the twin tailed one, but she interrupted him.</p><p><br></p><p>\"My name is Runi and I am Rias' younger cousin.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Ah… she was hiding her identity.</p><p><br></p><p>Well, who am I to ruin her fun?</p><p><br></p><p>\"Nice to meet you Runi. I am Mathias but you can call me Matty if you want.\" I patted her head with a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>If she is trying to pull a prank on me… why can't I have some fun too.</p><p><br></p><p>Zeoticus smiled on the side but I could see his lips twitching at this.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hey hey, do you like Camels?\" She asked, enthusiastically.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Camels? I don't dislike them. In fact I do have a few of them on my farm.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Ohh really? Can I see them?\" She jumped up excitedly.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I don't see why not. We can see them after the party. They are not the usual kind of camels that you might be familiar with.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! There are no camels in this world that I am not familiar with.” She puffed her chest, proudly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hoh! Wanna bet?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Bet? What are the stakes?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Stakes hmm. How about if you win, I will give you the camels in my farm. All of them.” I offered. I only had twelve so it’s not a big deal. “But if I win…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm what if you win? Do you want to marry me with Big Sis Rias too?” She teased smugly.</p><p><br></p><p>From the corner of my vision, I saw Zeoticus facepalming while Sirzechs looked embarrassed as well.</p><p><br></p><p>“No no. While that would be any man’s dream, the stakes on both sides won’t be fair. So, if I win… how about you tell me who you actually are?”</p><p><br></p><p>The people around me all paused and she looked at me, slightly surprised too.</p><p><br></p><p>“What do you mean who I am? I already told you. I am Runi, Big Sis Rias’ little sister.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha sure you are. We never disagreed on it. I just want to know who you are if I win. Till then be whatever you want to be.” I laughed and again patted her head.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh what makes you think I am someone else?”</p><p><br></p><p>“A few reasons. First, Rias has never told me about any family member of your age, female or named anything even remotely similar to Runi nor have I ever seen you on any occasions. Second, someone with your level of strength… is generally not as young as you.” Looking at her surprised expression, I explained. </p><p><br></p><p>“Senjutsu.” And a look of understanding came on their faces. “Even your life force feels more mature than anyone else in this room, one of the oldest I have seen yet. There is also your smell. You smell most similar to Lady Chysis, but as the generations go by, the familiarity of your smell grows lighter which means you are probably a generation or two higher than Lady Chysis.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Call me grandmother.” Lady Chysis smiled at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Grandmother then.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What else? What other reason?” Runeas or rather Runi asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“There is another reason. I have a picture of you in one of my oldest albums with my ancestor.” I smiled and her face blanched.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tch. Smart ass.” She clicked her tongue, pouting.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hehehehe this is the first time I have seen someone get the upper hand against Ancestor.” Chysis laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>“I haven’t lost yet. It’s a matter of Camels. I will not lose.” She retorted.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yup. Our bet is still going on. Till then Runi, enjoy the party.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will.”<br><br></p><p>Sirzechs and his wife came in next with their son and greeted me. His son, Milicas, is really adorable. “Happy Birthday Mathias.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We have completed the paperwork for your Lordships. You are now officially the Lord of both your houses and don’t need to hide your identity anymore.”</p><p><br></p><p>I let out a breath. “To be honest, I have mixed feelings about revealing myself. On one hand, I can stop hiding. On the other hand, I won’t be able to hide anymore.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha well, we can’t have it all.” He laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>While we talked, several other guests arrived as well.</p><p><br></p><p>It was Serafall and her family.</p><p><br></p><p>Lord Sitri was the one who came first. “Many congratulations on coming of age, Lord Buné. It’s a pleasure to have you among us.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you. The pleasure is all mine.” I bowed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Happy Birthday, Lord Buné.” Sona came up and congratulated me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Just call me Matty like always. I wouldn’t want my friends to call me by that title.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s… I would be honoured.” She pushed up her glasses a bit and blushed.</p><p><br></p><p>Next to come up was Armin and his family. In fact, he was already here and only received his family who came.</p><p><br></p><p>I saw Falbium come along with him too. He came up to me with his parents.. “Congratulations on your birthday, Lord Buné. I don’t believe that we haven't had the time to talk yet despite you being Armin’s best friend. I hope we can get to know each other more. Please do visit us sometimes when you are free.” His father greeted me.</p><p><br></p><p>“No no. That would mostly fall on me. I am a bit of a recluse I guess.” I laughed. “But thank you. I will be sure to visit soon.” I shook hands with him.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next hour several guests came. Some expected and some unexpected.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean I did hope that Lord Belial and his wife would come seeing they had come during my parent’s funeral. What I wasn’t expecting was Diehauser Belial himself coming to the party and that too, not alone but with another person.</p><p><br></p><p>Roygun Belphagor, the second place of the Rating Games.</p><p><br></p><p>They came and greeted me. Armin, on my side, attracted the attention of the two.</p><p><br></p><p>“Armin Glasya-Labolas. I have heard that you will be participating in the Rating Games soon. I wish to fight against you someday. Your first Rating Game was certainly very unique.” Diehauser said.</p><p><br></p><p>“I just wish to test myself more. I am not aiming for the Top Ten position.” Armin shook his head.</p><p><br></p><p>“All the better then. I hope we will be able to help test your limits.” Ryogan said. “Will you be participating too, Lord Buné?” She asked, turning to me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Me? I am sorry but the House related work will be keeping me busy for a while so I don’t know if I will be able to participate. I might try some to try and get my Peerage Members to High Class rank.”</p><p><br></p><p>“If you ever need any help, please feel free to ask me. Father has told me about the relation between him and your grandfather. If possible, I would like to reestablish the friendship between the two houses.”</p><p><br></p><p>He offered me a hand and I shook it.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>After that others came too.</p><p><br></p><p>Surprising ones like the old Demon Mephisto Pheles with his Queen, the former Dragon King Tannin and even the current Lord Mammon with his bishop, Rudiger Rosenkreuz, another one of the top ten Rating Game Players.</p><p><br></p><p>They were good friends with Euclid and came at his advice. He was quite well acquainted with the Extra Demons.</p><p><br></p><p>Similarly, several other people came at the advice of Zeoticus and Sectus like the Phenex House, the Amon, the Vapula, Sai’s uncle to be precise, the Archduke Agares, the brother of Sectus with his family. Leila managed to drag in her uncle as well. Too bad that annoying brat, Diodora was also here along with Zephyrdor.</p><p><br></p><p>Good thing was that Zephyrdor was behaving properly after being glared at by Armin. He was shit scared.</p><p><br></p><p>Many others had sent some from their families or servants even when they didn’t appear directly.</p><p><br></p><p>All in all, while nothing like the parties I generally went to, it was still quite a gathering by the end of the night.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Zeoticus -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t understand why you asked me to come to this party with my family, Zeo. I mean, sure it would look good to the new Lord Buné if we did but…” His old friend Reven asked. As usual, he was quite picky.</p><p><br></p><p>“What do you think of the place? They decorated it quite well.” He asked, looking around. He was waiting for the announcement before explaining anything.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. They did quite well. It must have taken quite a good water and ice mage to make the ice sculpture looking at their sizes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. Mathias has a very skilled Water Mage and Ice Mage in his peerage.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s just that I don’t recognise most of the plants around the place. What kind of fruits are those? And are those Dryads over there? I thought they never go to polluted areas and yet they are living in one of the most barren lands of the entire Underworld.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Everything here was grown by little Mathias by his own two hands. You must have heard about his obsession with his farm right. Even the Dryads all belong to him. He plans to go into the food industry.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The food industry eh? While we do import most of our food, the ones in the Underworld are strictly under the Amy and the Shax Houses. And those two… it will be hard for the new Lord Buné to enter the industry or at least establish himself.” Reven concluded.</p><p><br></p><p>And while it would have been true, he laughed knowing what he did about Mathias.</p><p><br></p><p>“What you don’t think so?” Reven looked at him.</p><p><br></p><p>“On the contrary, I think Mathias is going to completely crush the food industry of not only the Underworld but also the human world. He has already started a good business in the Human World.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Let me show you why.” He led Reven to the place where the food was being served.</p><p><br></p><p>There were already a few people around the food stands.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Lord Belial, Lord Astaroth.\" He greeted the ones at the food stands.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Lord Gremory, Lord Phenex.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Enjoying the food? It's Lord Bunè's speciality after all.\" He asked, as he began to pick something up for himself to eat.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Speciality? How good could it be? I still don't understand why Leila dragged me to this party. Sure the kid is her student but her presence should have been enough. Even for the Satans who are probably here only due to the death of Morton Bunè could have done with the casual appearance of only one.\" Lord Astaroth replied gruffly.</p><p><br></p><p>He held back a grimace.</p><p><br></p><p>Venelana had told him about the attitude of the Astaroth heir against Mathias. It seems that it has spread to Lord Astaroth as well.</p><p><br></p><p>He did observe that Lord Belial didn't say anything but didn't look approving of Lord Astaroth's attitude.</p><p><br></p><p>The man didn't realise how lucky he was to have Leila as his niece.</p><p><br></p><p>But he didn't say anything and just picked up some of the things he had eaten the last time and suggested some to Lord Phenex.</p><p><br></p><p>And then it happened. His friend, Reven paused as soon as he took a bite of the food. Beside him, both Lord Belial and Lord Astaroth did the same too.</p><p><br></p><p>\"What exactly is this, Zeo? I have never tasted anything like this before.\"</p><p><br></p><p>The other two looked at him with a questioning gaze too.</p><p><br></p><p>\"These were all hand grown by Lord Bunè personally. You all really have no idea what he grows on his farm, do you?\"</p><p><br></p><p>“What does it matter what he grows on a farm?” Lord Astaroth scoffed even as he took more of the dishes on his plate.</p><p><br></p><p>He gave the man a smile for the sake of politeness while thinking how he would react to the news about the engagement.</p><p><br></p><p>Right at this time, a few more people joined them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Lord Sitri, Lord Glasya-Labolas.” He nodded at the new arrivals.</p><p><br></p><p>“Lord Gremory.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Enjoying the party I see.” He smiled at the two looking at their jovial moods.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. It’s quite an elaborate arrangement. I can’t believe Mathias did all this in a few years. I almost didn’t recognise the Buné lands and thought that I had teleported to a different place. I had to call Armin to receive me.” He laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>“I did hear that Armin was staying here. They get along very well from what I have heard.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Get along well would be putting it mildly. He barely returns home nowadays. I have no idea what he does.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s fine isn’t it? After all, there is hardly any devil of his generation who could compete with Armin Glasya-Labolas. There are even rumours of him being similar to Satan Lucifer and Satan Beelzebub” Reven said. “I am a bit surprised that he didn’t continue to participate in the Rating Games after his first debut victory.”</p><p><br></p><p>Lord Glasya-Labolas merely shrugged. “I don’t question his decisions and he gives me results in return. As for what and how he does what he does is all unknown to me. But I did hear that he will be competing in the Rating games more often now. He took the last few months to train his peerage members.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. It’s no wonder.”</p><p><br></p><p>Lord Belial took the chance to ask something. “Say Lord Glasya-Labolas, do you know anything about the new Lord Buné? From what I have seen the new Lord has a good head on his shoulders but what kind of person is he?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Mathias? I’ll be honest but I don’t know much about him apart from the fact that Armin respects him immensely and considers him a brother no less than Falbium. We have only had a chance to meet once during Armin’s birthday. My wife seems to know and adore him a lot though. I guess I will have to rectify this.”</p><p><br></p><p>“He is good friends with Sona too and Serafall seems to think well of him. From what little I have heard, he seems to be close to Euclid. I think he is quite close to the Gremory Heiress too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“At least he seems to have a decent political awareness. Getting close to the prominent members of the next generation.” Lord Astaroth commented. “He seems to be quite close to Latia too since Leila was his teacher.”</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, he was really waiting for the announcement to see his expression and as if the Satans had heard his wish, he saw Sirzechs taking the stage.</p><p><br></p><p>“You seem to know about him too, Lord Gremory. Would you add something?” Lord Belial looked at him then.</p><p><br><br></p><p>\"Look there. You will know.\" He pointed towards the stage.</p><p><br></p><p>They turned around just in time to see Sirzechs begin.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ladies and Gentlemen, a good evening to you all.”</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone turned towards him and he continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am very pleased to be here on today’s occasion. I met Mathias, six years ago, when a twelve year old child had come to my office to receive his Evil Pieces. Fair to say I was surprised. A boy, his age coming from the Buné lands of all places. On asking further I found out that his parents, former Lady and Lord Buné had disappeared. We investigated and we all know the results. In a way, the criminals were caught due to the contribution of Mathias on that day.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That was a scandal, alright. To think they would be so crazy. They are lucky they were able to escape with just a lifetime imprisonment. If left outside, I doubt they would have survived past a month.” Lord Sitri commented.</p><p><br></p><p>“A week would be pushing it. I would give them a week at best. They crossed the line when they started experimenting on the members of other Houses.” Reven commented.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But that was not the end of my surprises that day. On that day, I found out that Mathias possessed not just one Clan Trait but two, from each of his parents' side.”</p><p><br></p><p>Murmurs ran through the place at the reveal.</p><p><br></p><p>“One of them was the Buné House trait, a House which would have gone extinct had Mathias not inherited the power. And the other was a trait from an Extinct House, which he is the sole living member of. Fair to say that he passed both the tests, making him the first person to not only revive an Extinct House but also become the Head of two different Houses.”</p><p><br></p><p>At this point the entire venue was resounding with guesses.</p><p><br></p><p>“Zeo, what do you know? You have been awfully smug since the start.” Reven asked suspiciously.</p><p><br></p><p>He let out a smile and said. “Keep watching.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs waited till the crowd became quiet once more. “So, on this happy occasion, I would like to welcome a new member among us. Please welcome Lord Mathias Buné….Zagan, Ladies and Gentlemen.”</p><p><br></p><p>There was a moment of silence….</p><p><br></p><p>And the crowd erupted completely.</p><p><br></p><p>“By the Satans!” Lord Sitri exclaimed, looking shocked.</p><p><br></p><p>“So that’s why? No wonder, no wonder.” Lord Glasya-Labolas had a look of realisation on his face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Zagan….did he just say Zagan? <em>That</em> Zagan?” Reven asked, stunned.</p><p><br></p><p>“What other Zagan is there?”</p><p><br></p><p>“And he inherited <em>that</em> power. So all these food items and his farm….oh! You knew about it?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I had to keep it a secret. It was Mathias’ own secret to reveal after all. Only a handful of people knew about it due to security reasons.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Understandable. Heaven and the Fallen Angels had left no means untouched to remove them. I am pretty sure even the Old Satan faction would have left no methods unused to have them by their side. Their Life Magic is just that useful.” Lord Sitri offered.</p><p><br></p><p>“How proficient is the new Lord Zagan with his Clan Trait?” Reven asked him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mathias has been doing nothing but training for the last seven years or so. Everything we are eating at this party was made by him personally.”</p><p><br></p><p>He observed Lord Astaroth from the corner of his eyes and saw him still in shock.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs continued, attracting their attention. “As we all know, the Zagan House was hunted down by Heaven and the Fallen Angels to the extent that one of the Archangels did a suicidal attack on the first Zagan to take him down. They relentlessly targeted the Zagan House knowing its importance to the Underworld and the Devil Race….and there was a chance that they could have tried to do so if they had gotten a wind of the situation. Not to mention the hidden dangers like the former Naberius who were the cause of the death of the last Lord of the House of Buné, Mathias’ father, Lord Morton Buné.”</p><p><br></p><p>He let the information sink in before continuing. “We as the Satans, the leaders of our race, couldn’t allow our race to suffer such a loss and thus we decided to keep his identity hidden till he was ready to appear in front of the Underworld. In the meantime, he was given the time to study and prepare himself for the future. And finally today, I am glad to see him standing here, among us, as one of the upcoming pillars of the Devil Race.”</p><p><br></p><p>There was an applause from the audience.</p><p><br></p><p>“But the good news doesn’t just end. There is another announcement, something which is a matter of personal joy to me.” He smiled. “This morning, Mathias has accepted two proposals for engagements.” And there it was.</p><p><br></p><p>Reven looked towards him, already understanding where this was going.</p><p><br></p><p>He apologised. “I couldn’t say anything before for this reason. I am really sorry for not being able to say anything earlier.\" He had been feeling guilty to keep such a thing from his long time friend despite the circumstances.</p><p><br></p><p>Reven let out a sigh. “I understand. I did wonder why you were delaying the talks or diverting the topic whenever I broached the subject. I guess I was being a bit selfish to push despite getting the hint. When did it happen?”</p><p><br></p><p>The ones around him had also heard the talks and congratulated him as well.</p><p><br></p><p>“This morning. Mathias didn’t want to be engaged without Rias’ agreement and we didn’t want him to sign any agreement while he wasn’t of age to avoid whatever was coming later. We just gave them time to get to know each other and they decided to announce everything at today’s party.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Congratulations my friend.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.” He smiled, finally feeling a bit lighter after being able to reveal everything</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“As of today, he is engaged to my own little sister Rias Gremory for the position of Lady Buné and… Latia Astaorth, for the position of Lady Zagan.”</p><p><br></p><p>He threw a look at Lord Astaorth who was by this point looking at the stage with an open mouth.</p><p><br></p><p>They too walked towards the stage where Mathias was currently being surrounded by members of the other Houses, trying to greet him with a sudden increase in enthusiasm.</p><p><br></p><p>The ones who were sent by their masters or house heads were currently busy calling their houses to inform them of the sudden change in the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>As they reached the stage, they heard a loud voice which suddenly made Reven hold his head, sighing loudly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mathias Buné Zagan, I challenge you for the hand of Rias Gremory in marriage.”</p><p><br></p><p>He felt his eye twitch while Reven was massaging his head.</p><p><br></p><p>“Riser!” Ruval quickly went beside him to stop him from making a scene. “I apologise, Lord Buné Zagan. My brother was out of line.”</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully it looked like Mathias didn’t take offence. He turned towards Riser to answer. “I refuse.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Afraid?” Riser taunted.</p><p><br></p><p>“Riser, be quiet.” Ruval held Riser’s shoulder to stop him.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. If it was just a challenge, I would gladly accept but this is not a simple challenge is it? You don’t seem to realise something very simple. If I accepted this challenge, it would be extremely insulting to my fiance because that would imply that I think of her as an object which anyone can come up and bet for. She is not an object. She is someone who I love and respect. And thus, I could but will not accept the challenge on principle.”</p><p><br></p><p>He felt a light smile come to his lips at this reply. While it was a brilliant political answer to give in such a situation, knowing the boy, he doubted he had even thought about that angle.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, as a father, it was heartening to see his daughter being engaged to a man who cared for her.</p><p><br></p><p>Riser seemed to have realised his mistake but he had already gone up and couldn’t back out without making a fool of himself so he went on. “Then I challenge you to a Rating Game to prove that I am a better match to Rias than you.”</p><p><br></p><p>Several people on both sides were watching the situation, probably trying to see how the new Lord handled the scene to get a read on his temperament.</p><p><br></p><p>“Zeo, how much chance does Riser have of winning?” Reven asked him, his eyes narrowed.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at his friend and he knew from his expression that he was extremely angry and was holding back due to the occasion.</p><p><br></p><p>“Zero percent.” He answered honestly.</p><p><br></p><p>“...Good. Then let this fight happen. I will talk to Lord Buné after today’s party to clear out the matter myself.”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at Reven in surprise. “I guess it’s also my own fault. Riser has gotten everything he has wanted since childhood and he has started taking everything for granted. His two wins in the Rating Games didn’t help either. I was hoping that getting engaged would make him serious which was why I was pushing so much for the engagement. But it seems I have to use another method to solve this problem. Let him have a taste of defeat and get to know how big the world is.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure? Wouldn’t it be too harsh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Today, he made a scene in front of so many people. If it’s not corrected, it might get worse later. A harsh method is much better than him making some mistake later on which might cost him dearly later on.”</p><p><br></p><p>He let out a sigh. “Alright. I will talk to Mathias.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>– Mathias –</strong></p><p><br></p><p>There was a small break and Zeoticus called me aside for some talks. I went there to see an unexpected face.</p><p><br></p><p>Lord Phenex.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is our first time meeting. I am Reven Phenex, Head of the Phenex House.” The guy offered a hand for a handshake and I reciprocated.</p><p><br></p><p>“Welcome Lord Phenex. I hope you liked the party.” I smiled. It would be foolish to blame him for a tantrum thrown by Riser.</p><p><br></p><p>“The party was wonderful. If anything I am here to apologise for the unseemly behaviour of my youngest son. He was out of line. I hope you will not take offence to it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No no. It’s fine. I… the circumstances were not the best which led me to hide my identity. Although a bit misguided, in a way, I can understand Riser’s point of view too. If I am not wrong, he seemed to have a crush on Rias and a heartbreak can make people act emotionally. I don’t mind. No one was hurt.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Still, he should know better than to throw a tantrum at such an occasion.” The man looked really angry. “There was a reason I didn’t stop his foolishness though. If possible, would you listen to a request of mine?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes?” I asked, slightly confused.</p><p><br></p><p>“The reason I didn’t stop this challenge was because Zeo assured me that Riser had no chance of winning. I won’t lie. My son has gotten everything he has wanted since he was a child and is fairly talented too. He is even considered the second strongest of his generation and has won both his Rating Games in an overwhelming manner and this has done nothing but boost his ego too much. And all of this has led to what happened today. If this continues then sooner and later, he will do something from which I won’t be able to protect him from.” he explained.</p><p><br></p><p>I understood his reasons. This man was genuinely worried about his son.</p><p><br></p><p>“So I request you… to defeat my son in the Rating Game.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Please defeat Riser in a Rating Game completely. In return, I promise you an alliance with the House of Phenex.” He offered.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the man, stunned to even speak anything. I then took a look at Zeoticus who nodded slightly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. I agree.”</p><p><br></p><p>We shook hands to seal the deal. And this was how my first Rating Game was decided.</p><p><br></p><p>I wondered what else would happen tonight as we were only halfway through the party.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x__________________________________________________________________x_________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I know many were waiting for this chapter but Matty’s reveal would have taken over 20k words so I divided it into a few chapters….and I tried not to make it a cliff.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>We finally got the first instalment of the reveal.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Matty is finally an Adult.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ingvild and Lavinia’s gifts rocked.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Valerie, lowkey the best wingwoman.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Matty met the camel fetishist.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Lord Astaroth would probably be open mouthed for a few days with the amount of shock he has received today.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Daddy Phenex is freaking mad.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Riser is screwed.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Stay tuned for the next chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>",

One side was covered in silk while the other was in cotton.</p><p><br></p><p>There were two faces resting on my chest, breathing lightly. </p><p><br></p><p>It has been a few months since Shizuka joined my peerage and there are three months until my birthday where I turn eighteen.</p><p><br></p><p>My relationship with both Lavinia and Ingvild improved a lot. We decided to take it slow and get to know more about each other first.</p><p><br></p><p>Lavinia was quite outgoing and most of the times acted like an airhead but at times, she could be very serious.</p><p><br></p><p>Ingvild on the other hand was so kind and pure that I doubted she was even a devil, let alone the descendant of Satan Leviathan.</p><p><br></p><p>Both the girls were understanding enough to give Rias, Latia and me some alone time. While Rias was young and didn’t think much about these things, Latia however felt insecure about things at times. And yet, she pushed this relationship forward because it was supposedly good for the House.</p><p><br></p><p>I really don’t understand girls.</p><p><br></p><p>So I have been doing what I can from my side as well. We have been spending more time together. Often going to the Human World to set up my businesses as she enjoys those things.</p><p><br></p><p>As for the Human world, things in Japan were still heated up, especially considering the news about the rebellion of the Old Kyoto Youkai brewing in Kyoto which has actually picked up pace due to the Shinto’s suffocating suppression recently.</p><p><br></p><p>Several youkai were thinking of leaving that area or even Japan as a whole and move to other countries and even the Underworld. It is still slow but might increase later on.</p><p><br></p><p>I was thinking of attracting them to my territories because Youkai are more or less nature spirits and most of them are very good at taking care of plants.</p><p><br></p><p>I moved to get up and both the girls felt my movement. Lavinia snuggled more while Ingvild woke up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good Morning.” I greeted them as both of them slowly woke up.</p><p><br></p><p>Lavinia hugged my neck and placed a kiss on my lips. “Good Morning.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ingvild on the other hand was much more tame and only hugged me with a light peck on the cheeks.</p><p><br></p><p>She was still quite shy but was coming out of her shell.</p><p><br></p><p>We got up and I started getting ready for the day.</p><p><br></p><p>During this time, things had calmed down a lot. We had gotten into a routine. Training and preparing for what is to come.</p><p><br></p><p>Since it was almost time to reveal my identity, I was planning to seriously clear the area under the Buné and the Zagan House of the Demonic Beasts from the Pits.</p><p><br></p><p>I have been preparing for this day for a long time. The Dragons in my farm are strong enough under regular training and good food from the farm and my Dryads have been evolving continuously to C+ Rank from the harvest of my Hunting Squads.</p><p><br></p><p>There are around thirty five Dragons and two hundred Dryads from C- to C+ Ranks on my farm to regularly maintain it.</p><p><br></p><p>I could very well attack the Pits right now although there would be heavy casualties at my current level. Not to mention, the Pits were a very good source of unlimited food for my farm animals.</p><p><br></p><p>With some of the future food items needing insane amounts of nutrients, I actually plan to use the pits as food sources to grow those.</p><p><br></p><p>There were a total of seventy two major and minor Pits in the Underworld. Twelve of them were in the Devil territories while seven of them were in the Fallen Angel territories. Other Pantheons mainly avoid the Pits because they are extremely hard to clear and they could make completely new dimensions instead of freeing those areas in the Underworld.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the most powerful Hindu Pantheon has their own dimension for their departed souls. Swarga and Narka ruled by Indra and Yama respectively.</p><p><br></p><p>Apart from them, there is Yomi, Cocytus, etc of the different pantheons also had different dimensions although their doors were in the Underworld.</p><p><br></p><p>Two of these pits were near my territory. Well to be precise, one was on my Buné territory while the other was a little distance away from the Zagan territory, in the unclaimed wilderness.</p><p><br></p><p>Now there was a thing about unclaimed lands. If someone can free them, it's theirs. Even the previous Satans who ruled the lands with an iron fist or the other factions who didn't want each other to rise didn't interfere with this rule. </p><p><br></p><p>Why?</p><p><br></p><p>Very simple.</p><p><br></p><p>It was nigh impossible to clear a pit without extreme casualties, and no one wants to bear that.</p><p><br></p><p>But today was not about clearing those areas but rather the Demonic beast who had come out of those areas and into my territories.</p><p><br></p><p>We are projecting an estimate of five hundred Ultimate Class beasts all over the area. There were also High Class and Middle Class Beasts which we didn’t bother even counting.</p><p><br></p><p>Individually, they were not a problem for me but the problem was that they rarely ever attacked individually. Most of them formed hordes.</p><p><br></p><p>And numbers can be overwhelming.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs will be sending his Peerage members and Serafall will be sending Euclid to watch over us.</p><p><br></p><p>I got ready for the day and went on to prepare breakfast for everyone.</p><p><br></p><p>Apparently, getting them used to B+ Ranked Cooking was not a good idea.</p><p><br></p><p>Shizuka knew cooking and Ingvild was getting quite good at it too but most of the people still insisted on me cooking most of the days.</p><p><br></p><p>My stats haven't grown over the last two years but I am still getting stronger. Mainly due to the Gourmet Cells and other Skills.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Host: Mathias Buné</strong></p><p><strong>Title: The Poor Noble, Pure Blooded Devil, The Farmer</strong></p><p><strong>Age: 17 years old. </strong></p><p><strong>Body: B+</strong></p><p><strong>Mind: B+</strong></p><p><strong>Spirit: B+</strong></p><p><strong>Magic: B+</strong></p><p><strong>Luck: B+</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Skills:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Buné Clan Trait:</strong></p><p><strong>Dragon Taming: B+</strong></p><p><strong>Dragonification: B+</strong></p><p><strong>Dragonfire: B+</strong></p><p><strong>Dragon's Aura: B+</strong></p><p><strong>Dream Manipulation: B+</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Zagan Clan Trait:</strong></p><p><strong>Life Magic: B+</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Gourmet Cells: C+</strong></p><p><strong>Gourmet Demon: Derous, S+[C+]</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Magic:</strong></p><p><strong>Teleportation: B+</strong></p><p><strong>Bounded Field Creation: B+</strong></p><p><strong>Memory Alteration: B</strong></p><p><strong>Barrier Magic: B+</strong></p><p><strong>Spatial Magic: B+</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Martial Arts: B+</strong></p><p><strong>Touki: B+</strong></p><p><strong>Cooking: B+</strong></p><p><strong>Senjutsu: B</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Abnormality Resistance: B+</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Farm Management</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Farm Rank: B</strong></p><p><strong>Farming Points: 4,078,512.</strong></p><p><strong>Money: 1,272,569,000Ⱡ</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Shop</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Inventory</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I will be starting to work on Food Honour and Food Immersion soon enough. With my Gourmet Cells reaching a high enough level, it would be suicidal not to.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good Morning, Shizuka.” I greeted the black haired girl as I entered the kitchen.</p><p><br></p><p>She always took her duty very seriously.</p><p><br></p><p>The Dragon Nature has been having some effect on her. Not to mention she gets hers from the strongest Dragon of this world. She was slightly more aggressive. Especially when she was training.</p><p><br></p><p>Dragons have a certain ability to go into an outrage when they are angered too much. She often goes into such a state when pushing herself.</p><p><br></p><p>Tia has taken over her training and was treating her brutally. She didn’t back down either and always trained till she dropped and lost consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>In just these three months, she had gone from D+ to C Rank which could even go to C+ when she went into an outrage. It’s just that Outrage is a double edged sword. The user loses their sanity when in the outrage mode and only the top tier Dragons retain any of their senses to even distinguish between friends and foes.</p><p><br></p><p>This was even worse for her who was still recovering from a mental trauma like hers.</p><p><br></p><p>Normally, Tia can manage her easily but it can be a danger when she is around others. Twice, Leafa had to calm her down while other times I did.</p><p><br></p><p>Since then she has started to rely more on me or as Tia said - Dragons were strictly ranked on power. They respected the dragons stronger than them and in most cases also deferred to them too.</p><p><br></p><p>It was almost instinctual. The current Shizuka was more of a Dragon than anything and she was actually very new to this. When faced with the likes of Tia and me, she almost subconsciously defers to me.</p><p><br></p><p>This matched with her original gratitude and sense of duty made her extremely loyal.</p><p><br></p><p>I got her to talk a bit about herself and open up to Leila and we are now working on helping her.</p><p><br></p><p>We mainly relied on the perfume made from the Peaceful Flowers normally but it was only a temporary solution. We are trying to help her control this because certain high level dragons have the ability to control their sanity to some extent even when in an outrage.</p><p><br></p><p>Which brings me to my cute familiar, my Sky Dear, Leafa. She was eating well and growing quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>It has been almost two years since I got her and she was already insanely strong. In fact, she was the strongest one on my farm.</p><p><br></p><p>Leafa was a genuine A- Rank and was just a bit shy from A, almost at Tia’s level. It’s just that her ability makes her the strongest one.</p><p><br></p><p>Just her size, which was no smaller than any small mountain could make her a formidable foe. She mostly rested in the animal farms and several of my dragons rested on her back, making a habitat over there.</p><p><br></p><p>She is learning how to control her back channels so that I can grow crops which take hundreds of millions of years in a short period of time as long as I provide them with sufficient nutrients.</p><p><br></p><p>Maintaining the Back Channel over an area with proper control is the key and she needs a lot of practice for it.</p><p><br></p><p>I really need to unlock the next Farm Level for better products and B Ranked Dryads who can boost the growth of plants.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Good Morning.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Are you ready for today?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hmm.\" She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Any news from Tia? I think she said something about going out somewhere.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"She said she had to go somewhere. She will be returning by nighttime.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I see. Well, today is going to get busy. You can leave this to me and prepare for today.\" I offered.</p><p><br></p><p>\"All preparations have been done. I can help out…\"</p><p><br></p><p>I put a hand on her head making her pause. \"Take a break. You are pushing yourself too hard again. I sensed that you were training till late last night.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"But I…\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"That's an order.\" I spoke sternly, making the girl pause. The look on her face made me let out a sigh. \"If not for yourself, at least do it for Akeno. It was her who cleaned you and brought you to bed last night. They are worried about you too, you know.\" I said softly, slowly caressing her hair.</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded lightly.</p><p><br></p><p>Before she left, I added something else. \"Shizuka.\"</p><p><br></p><p>She looked back.</p><p><br></p><p>\"You are now a part of my peerage, <em>my</em> family. I will never let anything happen to you or anyone else in our family. Trust me.\"</p><p><br></p><p>She paused for a second and then hummed a yes very softly.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Thank you.\" She added before leaving the kitchen.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hmm.\"</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>\"There are fourteen Ultimate Class beasts in this group. The largest we have seen so far. The leader of the group is a flying beast and can attack with poison which paralyses and then melts someone from inside out.\" Armin explained the reports from the surveillance drones.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Other monsters support it. There are three other flying beasts who protect the leader and are probably immune to its poison. The others mow down anyone coming from land after which they are torn apart by the three hundred High Class beasts.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Why can't I bombard them with dragonfire and be done with it? With Ingvild boosting me, I could easily take care of the flying group without even getting close.\" I questioned.</p><p><br></p><p>\"The poison glands of the leader are needed for research. There is reward money for it. The feathers of the Flying Beasts are greatly in demand for their use in the Textile Industries and the carapace of the land ones are extremely important in making armour and equipment for our armies. We can sell just this group for an estimated price of five billion Liliums. Don't ruin it with Dragonfire.\" Latia chided.</p><p><br></p><p>She had been busy for the whole last month to make detailed plans about this whole cleanup from the economic side of things.</p><p><br></p><p>I was of the mind that we would just roll over the group with sheer might but she pointed out how much resources we would be wasting. The estimated price made even me hesitate slightly. The estimated price for all the harvest according to her would be… around Two hundred billion Liliums.</p><p><br></p><p>I was about to call bullshit, not that I would. I knew better than to poke that hornet's nest. But apparently my little bro Sai wasn't that wise. She showed the entire report she had worked on for the last month, the deals which she had made with Lord Gremory and Falbium Asmodeus on my behalf, (the former was quite happy with it) and even the exact calculations for the amount. The entire file was eight hundred pages thick.</p><p><br></p><p>Turns out it wasn't two hundred billion but rather two hundred and fifteen billion. The last fifteen was a margin.</p><p><br></p><p>And to think I was about to feed everything to my dogs and use it as fertilisers…</p><p><br></p><p>This much money is the entire worth of some of the less prominent houses even with the thousands of years of accumulation while for some other houses, they would be able to come out of bankruptcy and regain their Pillar status with this sort of money.</p><p><br></p><p>Now I was coming to understand why Leila and Venelana were so worried about Pure Blooded Devil girls trying to get into my pants.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. I will think of something.” I thought of an idea. I really didn’t like this one but it was the safest bet available. “You all will exit the area. The next attack will be dangerous for everyone.”</p><p><br></p><p>I sensed the questions bubbling in many and stopped them. “Trust me. I will be fine.” I reassured them.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone of us worked in teams.</p><p><br></p><p>My and Armin’s peerages were the attacking force with us taking the lead and them covering the back so that no one could bypass us and cause trouble in the rear.</p><p><br></p><p>Armin was in charge of the planning. The Glasya-Labolas were mostly generals of the Devil armies and he was trained from childhood in different strategies.</p><p><br></p><p>He was using the Demonic Beasts to practise.</p><p><br></p><p>Back in our camp were Rias’ peerage members who were acting as medics and storing the harvest.</p><p><br></p><p>They reluctantly left the area to our previous camp and I got to work.</p><p><br></p><p>Space Magic, Life Magic and Dream Magic. These three things were extremely dangerous when used together.</p><p><br></p><p>First I created the virus which cut off the signals of the brain to the rest of the body. Second, I used Dream Magic to cover myself in an illusion to avoid detection and finally teleported above the group and let the virus spread.</p><p><br></p><p>It’s just that this kind of thing cannot be done with anyone friendly near me. It took a few minutes to spread the virus. I made it so that these viruses cannot breed and die off and dissolve in the victim’s body in a few hours so there is no chance of spreading the disease or even retrieving the dead virus for any research.</p><p><br></p><p>The books Euclid had given me on Biological Magic were doing their work.</p><p><br></p><p>Within half an hour, the entire horde of Demonic Beasts were down.</p><p><br></p><p>They would have been able to react better if they knew what they were up against. For example, these viruses were bad against heat and fire. Also, since they were made up of Demonic Power, they were vulnerable to light and holy magic too. According to my estimates, if someone had more Demonic Power than me, there was a chance that these viruses might be repulsed provided they knew that they were infected by these. </p><p><br></p><p>But even then, this thing was more than capable of taking down most of this rabble. If I had to take a guess why this was not used before me, it would be because of several factors.</p><p><br></p><p>First, the expertise in different fields of studies required to pull this off was not easy to achieve. I got this because I could cheat using my System. I don’t think even the first Zagan would have been able to reach B+ Rank in Life Magic or had advanced knowledge of Biomancy.</p><p><br></p><p>Second was the Mind capacity and Magic Power required to pull off this move and control it without being affected by it. By my guess, the first Zagan would be C Ranked or if we push it, C+ Ranked in both Magic and Mind Stats.</p><p><br></p><p>I knew this because he was not in the B Ranks from what little I could gather.</p><p><br></p><p>With the horde cut off from their senses, I ordered the viruses to dissolve inside their bodies. Mission accomplished.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x_________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“How did you do this?” Still stunned at the sight in front of her, Latia asked me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Life Magic can be very dangerous. Let’s just leave it at that. I will explain in detail later. We have work to do now.” I said and although a bit reluctant, she agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>Euclid was taking care of harvesting the material so I went to him to see if he needed any help.</p><p><br></p><p>“Need a hand?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, Matty. No no. This is easier than I expected. Most of these Demonic Beasts are biologically still alive and will die only after a few days. Supernatural Beings are kept alive by the Demonic Power for longer periods of time. We can get excellent samples from these.” he paused for a moment and then asked. “You used those, didn’t you?”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded. “It was the safest bet. The leader of the group was too dangerous and could have messed things up. Don’t worry. I made sure all the viruses are gone. They would have naturally died and dissolved in a few hours. I not only dissolved them with my power but also waited for a few hours till they would have naturally dissolved.”</p><p><br></p><p>“As long as they are safe. But still, with this, we might even be able to clear off a pit directly.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Won’t be so easy. There are several beasts who could adapt to these viruses if we take long. Moreover, the pits are a source of free meat and fertilisers for my farm. It would be such a waste to destroy one.” I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>He let out a chuckle. “Only you would be crazy enough to use the pits for something like that.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I prefer to call myself an eccentric genius. Thank you very much.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha not much difference between those two so I agree.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, teach me something about Harvesting. I think it would be a good skill to have with my future line of work.” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure.”</p><p></p><p><strong>- Armin -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“I still don’t understand why you had to tag along.” He sighed, looking at Matty getting along well with his mother… over his childhood stories.</p><p><br></p><p>“Now Armin, that’s rude. Matty has been so helpful to find you a suitable girl. It’s only natural he gets to accompany us to see that this goes well.” His mother scolded while his best friend… made faces at him from behind her.</p><p><br></p><p>Somehow this didn’t seem like a good enough idea.</p><p><br></p><p>They had taken a break from the hunting Demonic Beasts for a whole month. He was learning more in these battles than he had done in all the classes till now.</p><p><br></p><p>Even his peerage members had progressed a lot due to these fights.</p><p><br></p><p>Tobio was a solid Ultimate Class and could retain sanity with his Balance Breaker. The other three had also attained their Balance Breakers and could rival the lower Ultimate Class Devils. Even Elanor, his familiar, had become stronger during the fights.</p><p><br></p><p>He was pretty sure Sai was pushing Ultimate Class by now because the kid worked harder than him.</p><p><br></p><p>But his brother or rather all the Satans had decided to give them a break. Apparently, even the Satans themselves needed time to process the materials because of just how fast they had been clearing the area.</p><p><br></p><p>They still had to be a bit covert due to keeping the source of all this a secret. Officially, there was a story that due to the Naberius’ experiments, there were some overflows from the pits and the Satans had sent their peerage members to cull those numbers. So they couldn’t rush too much or the story would fail.</p><p><br></p><p>There was only a month and a half till Matty turned eighteen and then all this would be revealed.</p><p><br></p><p>When he returned home, mother had been waiting to drag him to meet Lilitifa Vepar.</p><p><br></p><p>Matty volunteered to tag along as they were going to the Gremory territory and Rias and Lady Gremory were guiding them to the lake.</p><p><br></p><p>\"There. Lili lives there, in that lake.\" Rias pointed towards a large lake in the distance.</p><p><br></p><p>The Vepar had mermaid-like features in their normal forms. They could always take on a normal humanoid form when on land but preferred to live in and near water bodies instead.</p><p><br></p><p>They all flew towards the lake and Rias called upon the Vepar devil.</p><p><br></p><p>A girl with light green hair and elf-like ears came out of the lake.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Oh my, she is pretty.\" His mother praised. He sighed knowing what was to come.</p><p><br></p><p>He really should have come alone for the first meeting.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Lili, they are Lady Glasya-Labolas, Armin Glasya-Labolas and Mathias Bunè. Lady Glasya-Labolas wanted to talk to you about something.\" Rias told the confused girl.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Ah, I have heard about them. The mother of Satan Asmodeus and the strongest devil of our generation and… ah, umm, Mathias Bunè, the heir of the Bunè house. He can umm… tame dragons. That's pretty cool.\"</p><p><br></p><p>She stumbled upon Mathias' name. Probably because there were not many good things about him. Still only a peasant noble. She did try to be polite though which was more than most people did.</p><p><br></p><p>But then again, she was in a same if not an even worse situation since the Vepar had been declared extinct due to bankruptcy. Maybe that's why she could sympathise with Matty.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Umm what did you want to talk to me about?\" She asked, looking towards them.</p><p><br></p><p>\"How about we have a talk in private.\" His mother took the girl aside to talk while signalling them to wait. Lady Gremory followed her.</p><p><br></p><p>\"So… did you like her?\" Matty asked, as soon as they were out of earshot.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I haven't talked to her yet. How would I know?\" He replied.</p><p><br></p><p>\"But still… a first impression?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"She… seemed a bit too shy and timid.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Oh please, I bet if we go down the streets of New Lilith now, half the girls will act the same, Mr. Most Eligible Bachelor Under One Hundred.\"</p><p><br></p><p>He let out a sigh. \"You do know that when you come out with your real identity, they are all going to change their focus, right? I will remember all this then.\" He threatened.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Meh….as if you would let it go if I didn't say anything. I am just enjoying this while I can.\" He shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Well, he was not wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>\"So what about her?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I want to get to know her first to say anything.\" He replied.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Lili is a very good girl, you know. I often come here to play with my peerage. It's just that sometimes…\" Rias started to say something but paused.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Sometimes?\" Matty inquired.</p><p><br></p><p>\"There is that annoying idiot, Graag Forneus. He always comes to harass Lili.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Oh, tell me more about this guy. I thought he stopped when she moved here.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"No he didn't. He…\" She began explaining the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>From the short description, he gathered that Graag Forneus was a High Class Devil of the Forneus House who had an obsession with becoming a pirate. Most of his crew was gathered to fulfil this idea.</p><p><br></p><p>He had seen Lilitafa somewhere and had become obsessed with making her a part of his peerage and crew.</p><p><br></p><p>This was the reason why she moved from the Forneus territory in the Human World.</p><p><br></p><p>While they talked among themselves, his mother returned.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl was following her with a bowed head and a shy look on her face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Armin, go have a talk with Lili. Get to know each other.” Mother said when they came back. “I for one like her already but you two are the ones who will be spending their lives together so you should get to know each other.”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at his mother and then at the girl who was sneaking peeks at him and nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>At this time, something happened.</p><p><br></p><p>In the nearby lake, a ship popped up.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s…” Rias frowned while Lili cowered back.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is going on here?” his mother asked, looking confused at their reactions.</p><p><br></p><p>“He’s….” Rias went on to explain the situation to his mother while the ship came towards them and finally to a halt.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ahahahaha are you ready to join my crew, Lilitafa.” A guy with the face of an angler fish, stood at the helm of the ship as he shouted.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl cowered behind their group.</p><p><br></p><p>His mother, seeing all this, walked forward. “She will not be going anywhere. Lilitafa Vepar is getting married to my son and as such, is under the protection of my house.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And this is the Gremory territory. Everyone inside this territory is under the protection of the Gremory House.” Even Lady Gremory walked forward and stood in front of the group.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hah! Who do you bitches think you are? Do you think you can walk up and swing those knockers and I would agree to whatever bullshit you sprout? Get out of the way, unless you want to go for a ride on my ship that is ahhahaha.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Rias was right.</p><p><br></p><p>This guy was insane.</p><p><br></p><p>He saw the light scowl on his mother’s face and was about to go forward and handle this situation when he heard a voice. Matty had arrived beside him.</p><p><br></p><p>“You know, this is a good opportunity. The hero saves the damsel in distress.” Matty whispered. Only that it was loud enough for everyone except the fish-face to hear.</p><p><br></p><p>Even his mother and Lady Gremory could hear this.</p><p><br></p><p>“Now Mathias. Killing another High Class Devil is still a punishable crime.” Lady Venelana chided before adding one more line. “But beating them to an inch of their life in self-defence is not.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Matty, as if struck by an epiphany. He walked to the front of the group. “Say, your name is Graag Forneus, right?” He asked with a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>The other devil was confused at the sudden turn of events. “And what of it?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Can I ask you a question?”</p><p><br></p><p>“What question?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s a bit private. Can I go there and ask?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hah!”</p><p><br></p><p>Matty didn’t give him any chance to speak and went there near him and whispered something in his ears.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Armin had no idea what it was that Matty said but it apparently was too much for the Forneus Devil to handle as he let out a howl. “Attack! Catch that bastard! I will make him walk on the plank and feed him to my sharks!”</p><p><br></p><p>Matty, in the meantime, had already retreated behind him. “His all yours.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Venelana -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>They watched with curiosity as Armin stepped forward to clash against the uncouth Forneus devil.</p><p><br></p><p>Mathias, meanwhile, was standing in front of them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Won’t you be participating, Mathias?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“And take away Armin’s chance to be a hero? No way. I mean, imagine a few decades from now, when he tells his children a story about how he met their mother, it wouldn’t look good if I were to interfere in the fight.”</p><p><br></p><p>She and Greta Glasya-Labolas both giggled at his words, especially knowing he was saying them loud enough to make sure Armin heard them.</p><p><br></p><p>Poor Lili was probably the only one looking worried. “Umm, will he be alright? They are strong, you know.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s fine dear. Armin can manage this much. Right, Mathias?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. The guy himself is barely High Class while all his peerage members are Mid Class at best. Armin would have destroyed them if he wasn’t making sure they don’t die accidentally.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I have heard that you all have been training very hard the last year and have been spending time fighting demonic beasts. I have seen those beast carcasses myself. They looked quite strong.” She commented while they watched the fight.</p><p><br></p><p>Although it was more of Armin beating them up than fighting.</p><p><br></p><p>“So that’s what you all have been doing? He wouldn’t tell me anything about what’s going on and Falbium had been unusually quiet about everything.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Armin is mostly taking care of any strategies. He uses them as practice.”</p><p><br></p><p>The show was almost over. But that fool hadn’t given up.</p><p><br></p><p>“You. YOU!… wait,  just you wait.” The fool started a summoning ritual while Armin just watched.</p><p><br></p><p>“Shouldn’t he stop them?” Greta questioned.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nah. Stopping him now would give him hope that he could have won if he  completed the summoning. Hope is a dangerous thing. In the hands of a fool, even more so. It’s better if Armin crushes them completely so that he doesn’t try anything again.” Mathias replied casually.</p><p><br></p><p>She mentally gave him approval for his thoughts. Mentally break them if you cannot kill them so that they shiver even at the thought of attacking you.</p><p><br></p><p>She had heard from Sirzechs that he didn’t like killing unless necessary due to it being an act completely opposite to his Life Magic. It was good to see that it was not hindering him when it was necessary to act tough.</p><p><br></p><p>The summoning was completed and the lake rose. Several Killer Whale-type Demonic Beasts swarmed around the ship.</p><p><br></p><p>Armin just let out a sigh and faced them once more while Greta cheered for her son.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly a large tentacle rose out of the lake. The fool started laughing like mad while Lilita cowered behind Greta. “That’s… a kraken. His familiar.”</p><p><br></p><p>Oh. a Kraken.</p><p><br></p><p>“Get them. Kill them all.” The fool shouted.</p><p><br></p><p>Armin on the other hand didn’t even bother looking this way.</p><p><br></p><p>Several more tentacles rose and the beast rose out of the water.</p><p><br></p><p>Greta stepped forward.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let me, Auntie.” Mathias stopped her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh. Thank you sweetie.”</p><p><br></p><p>He turned towards her. “Killing a familiar in self-defence is not a crime, right?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No. And I have heard that Krakens are supposed to be a rare delicacy too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“All the better.”</p><p><br></p><p>He took a step forward and in front of her eyes, his entire figure disappeared as a huge gust of wind rushed back from the place he was at. He appeared right at the top of the kraken and touched its head. The beast collapsed as if a puppet with its strings cut.</p><p><br></p><p>The next moment, he was back beside them. “All done.”</p><p><br></p><p>She blinked.</p><p><br></p><p>And then she blinked once more.</p><p><br></p><p>That massive Kraken… She was sure she could have killed it. Between her own power and the aerial advantage her wings provided, it wouldn’t have stood any chance at all, but still, this…</p><p><br></p><p>She had heard about what he was capable of, but it was another thing watching it firsthand.</p><p><br></p><p>Poor Greta was even more shocked since she didn’t even have any idea about Mathias’ real strength.</p><p><br></p><p>Armin was done with the fool as well and returned with a kneeling and begging devil.</p><p><br></p><p>The entire affair was taken care of soon enough and Greta took Lili with her. The girl had a very timid personality and needed to toughen up or she would be torn apart by devil society.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x_________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“And this meat comes from the Kraken Mathias killed?” Zeoticus enquired.</p><p><br></p><p>“Not only did he kill but he cooked it as well. I must say that it's beyond anything our chefs could hope to make. He’s got quite the skill as a chef.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And what happened with the girl?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Greta will be announcing the engagement soon. Now that she knows that after Mathias’ reveal, the pressure on Armin will be lessened so she is going to take her time training her new daughter-in-law. Lili was quite happy with the arrangement. Their second child can apply for the reestablishment of the Vepar Pillar as long as they have enough funds which is quite easy with the support of the Glasya-Labolas House.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well she’s not wrong about it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Did something happen?” She asked, sensing him distracted.</p><p><br></p><p>“Lord Phenex proposed an engagement contract again.” He sighed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Riser has just turned eighteen and he has been waiting for our reply. I can see him getting anxious.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I did tell him that we are looking to give Rias some time to get comfortable before we decide on the topic. But she will be of age in a month. It seems like the youngest Phenex son has developed a crush on Rias. Lord Phenex thinks getting engaged will make the boy get a bit serious.” He sighed.</p><p><br></p><p>“As a parent, I can understand his worries but in two weeks, Mathias turns eighteen. It wouldn’t be an issue then.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sigh. I will just have to hold out till then.”</p><p><br></p><p>“How were the Demonic Beast carcasses?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh those. Yes. We won’t be having any shortage of high class materials for a while. Even with the hard bargain the little Astaroth Princess drove, we will be making profits from this entire deal for the next decade or so. Honestly, seeing the girl try so hard was adorable. She takes more after her mother but she has also inherited her father’s business acumen as well. She has already made billions from just the deals with us. And this is not even mentioning how much she profited from the military.”</p><p><br></p><p>“At least they are not being fed to dogs or used as fertilisers anymore. By the Satans, I don’t think my heart could take any more of that.”</p><p><br>“Yes. Mathias’ apparently seemed quite sad about that.”</p><p><br></p><p>“His precious plants and babies are not getting Ultimate Class meat. Obviously he would be sad.” She rolled her eyes. Although she found his antics adorable at times. A waste was still a waste.</p><p><br></p><p>“He still managed to convince Latia to use the Mid Class beasts and below as fertilisers after harvesting them for useful materials.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s just like him.” She shook her head. “Anyways, did you have a talk with Sectus regarding which house we will be signing the Engagement Contract with? Buné or Zagan?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I did. At this point, the engagement is a done deal from the children’s side so we decided to get this topic out of the way too. Mathias himself didn’t have any opinions. According to him they would both be family. It doesn’t matter which name they wanted to take.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Among us, we decided Rias will be getting the Buné name since it mainly deals with the ranch and Dragon reserve, the place from where our Textile Business is linked while Latia will get the Zagan name because they have a Wine Business linked with the farm side. The girls agreed because Rias thought Dragons were cooler and Latia wanted to expand the farm business more. It was almost unanimous from both sides.” He laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Dragons are cool? Sigh, what will I do with this girl? At least Latia seems to have the brains in the group.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We’d better start preparing for the reveal. Satans know what the other Houses will do when they find out about Mathias’ identity. Mother will be waking her up for this too. Just so other houses can be kept in control.” He said.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. Her waking up will truly be of great help.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Mathias -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Another month had passed since the incident with the Kraken.</p><p><br></p><p>The Forneus House was fined to high heavens for several charges of property destruction, attacking Ladies of other Pillar Houses, attacking heirs and heiresses of other Pillar Houses, attacking High Class Devils, and a ton of other ones. Sirzechs was mad and while the guy didn’t erase the fool, he made sure that the Forneus House wished he had. The reparations they paid were given mostly to Lilitifa while we got the Kraken harvests. The meat was as good as Venelana had said back then.</p><p><br></p><p>Today was Rias’ birthday. We were at the Gremory House to celebrate it.</p><p><br></p><p>I was dancing with Latia while Armin was escorting his newly announced fiance, Lilitifa Vepar.</p><p><br></p><p>For once, I was not getting the stink eye from the crowd for being near Armin. Today, that honour went to Lili.</p><p><br></p><p>Poor girl looked a cross between ecstatic at dancing with Armin and undergoing a nervous breakdown from the number of glares thrown her way.</p><p><br></p><p>\"So, two weeks more. And then we can finally stop playing hide and seek.\" Armin started.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hmm yeah. I am just not too thrilled about all this.\" I yawned.</p><p><br></p><p>\"What's up with him?\" Armin asked Latia.</p><p><br></p><p>\"He's been getting lessons from Mother and Lady Gremory on House Politics everyday. Technically, this <em>is</em> his debut. What he missed back then, he has to face now.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Ah. I see. Can't say that I am surprised though.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Just learning about these is annoying. I can't even imagine what facing them for real would be like. The most annoying part of it all is pretending to care about what others say no matter how stupid.\" I let out a sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Well, that's the way it is.\" Armin shrugged. \"Why do you think I try to avoid the crowd so much?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Isn't that due to the girls hounding you? Even now, the number of girls glaring at Lili is enough to cause a riot.\" I laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Matty.\" Latia called and I looked in the direction she was pointing towards.</p><p><br></p><p>There Rias, Sona and their queens were standing. It just seems like Rias herself was arguing with someone.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I think you should go and check.\" Latia said and I nodded before going in that direction. Latia also followed me.</p><p><br></p><p>As we got closer, we could hear the argument.</p><p><br></p><p>“I said I am fine. Can you please leave me alone now?” We could hear her voice.</p><p><br></p><p>“She sounds quite annoyed.” Latia whispered to me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p><br></p><p>Soon we found out the cause of the annoyance too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh don’t be stubborn, Rias. My father is already talking about our engagement. Isn’t it better for us to get to know each other before that?” A blonde haired and blue eyed guy which took me a moment to realise was actually none other than Riser Phenex said.</p><p><br></p><p>“And I have already told you that I don’t like you, Riser. How hard is that to understand?” She replied, but as someone who was by this time quite familiar with her habits, I could tell that she was on the verge of losing her temper. Latia recognised the signs too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Go on.” Latia gave me a push to stop her before she snapped.</p><p><br></p><p>At times like these I really wished I didn't have to hide things.</p><p><br></p><p>I walked up to the group. “Hey Rias, Sona, how are you all doing? Happy Birthday Rias. You look beautiful, by the way.” I greeted the group and complimented the girl.</p><p><br></p><p>“Matty! I mean Heir Buné. Ah, thank you. You look good too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Good evening, Heir Buné. Latia.” Sona bowed lightly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good evening Heiress Sitri. Happy Birthday, Rias.” Latia bowed to Sona and then greeted Rias.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked towards Riser and offered my hand. “Mathias Buné. Nice to meet you. I have heard about you, Riser Phenex. Your debut Rating Game was quite good.” I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Riser Phenex but you already know that. Yes. The Rating Game was easy. I wished there was someone stronger to push me. I have heard of you too. There are quite some rumours about you and your farm.” He didn’t continue but I understood the meaning.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha yes. I love my farm. I hope you didn’t hear anyone badmouth my farm now, did you?”</p><p><br></p><p>He was taken aback by the reply and didn’t know how to respond.</p><p><br></p><p>“Anyways, good knowing you, Riser. I will have to excuse myself now.” I turned towards Rias. “Can I have a dance with the birthday girl?” I asked in an effort to get her away from the scene.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh!” She seemed to be taken aback by the question but soon collected herself. “Yes. You may.” She offered me her hand and I accepted.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wait.” Riser called out suddenly, catching up with what was happening.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes?” I asked, pretending to be surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>“I was talking to her.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh. I didn’t realise you had already invited her for a dance.” I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“He didn’t. He just wanted to talk in private.” Rias added, eyes slightly narrowed.</p><p><br></p><p>“And do you want to?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No. Take me to dance.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright.” I turned to the flummoxed guy and c</p><p>ontinued. “Please excuse us.” And left the scene before things could go any further.</p><p><br></p><p>A little distance away, I asked. “So? What was that all about”</p><p><br></p><p>The look of slight annoyance came back to her face. “Lord Phenex recently proposed an engagement contract between him and I. He had done so a few years ago too but Father had diverted the topic. Now he asked again. The Phenex have been very good allies of our house and we couldn’t give them a proper answer due to having to hide your identity. So father could only hold on. Recently, he has been annoying me. I told him several times that I didn’t have any interest in him but… he’s too persistent. Not to mention, it’s always the same thing. My family this and my father that…”</p><p><br></p><p>“I think he’s trying to impress you. He’s just doing it all wrong.” I replied, understanding the situation. I kinda felt bad for the guy.</p><p><br></p><p>It seemed as if he had a crush on her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well I have no interest in his courting. I am already getting engaged.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry, you won’t have to hide anything in a few weeks.”</p><p><br></p><p>We just danced for a while.</p><p><br></p><p>Riser was wise enough to not cause any trouble here, especially since they weren’t exactly engaged so he didn’t have any reason to cause trouble.</p><p><br></p><p>When we were done dancing, the two of us went and joined our group and I used my trump card, The Armin Guard to block all kinds of interruptions.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall the day went fine.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, I just need to prepare for my own reveal.</p><p>____________________________x_________________________________________________________x_____________________________</p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server </strong><a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><strong>A new chapter of ‘The Farmer’ is up.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Few things happened.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>We are on the last bit of preparations for Matty’s reveal.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I tried to focus a bit on other characters in this chapter because the next chapters would be mostly about him.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>And the lewds.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Who doesn’t like the lewds?</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br><br><br></p>",

Till now they knew we were strong but had no idea about how strong.</p><p><br></p><p>And when they did… this was the result.</p><p><br></p><p>Since his Rating Game, Armin had been hounded by several devils for different kinds of things, especially marriage proposals. His mother had been furious, especially because several of the houses who had made fun of him before the match were now requesting to sign marriage contracts with him.</p><p><br></p><p>Armin just got up and left. He‘s been staying here for the last three months and plans to stay here for a year or so to avoid all that mess. His pawn, Lisbell, joined us as well. She felt that she was too weak and Armin’s mother didn’t want her to be left behind so she sent her.</p><p><br></p><p>I finally tested out my Biotope Creation Skill and made a zone with different gravities. The more one goes towards the centre, the more the gravity they experience.</p><p><br></p><p>The upper limit of the gravity is two hundred times earth’s gravity.</p><p><br></p><p>Armin and Sairaorg were at thirty times the gravity while the girls were at five times gravity right now.</p><p><br></p><p>Gravity training was much harder than what I had guessed previously.</p><p><br></p><p>It exerts pressure on all of the body, even the internal organs and makes blood flow harder as well. That said, it does push the Gourmet Cells harder to make them adapt. So, I too use it for my training.</p><p><br></p><p>Apart from this, I also changed the area where the Dragons live to double the normal gravity and plan to slowly increase the gravity to higher levels. Tiamat suggested this method. Dragons are extremely adaptive and they would grow faster this way.</p><p><br></p><p>I train at a much deeper level though. At the centre.</p><p><br></p><p>The only one beside me who trains there is Crom. Even Tia can only take one hundred and fifty times without challenging magic. And that was the purpose. To adapt the body to higher gravity. Using magic wouldn’t give the same results.</p><p><br></p><p>“Gyaaaaahhh!” A shout attracted my attention and I turned towards the side to see Gasper running around to save his life. There were two dragons following him.</p><p><br></p><p>This was Tia’s training for him. Those two dragons were taken in by Tia and she was training them herself.</p><p><br></p><p>Right now they were assigned to follow Gasper and breathe wisps of fire to scare him a little so that he runs for his life. The funny thing is that both the dragons actually enjoyed it. An even funnier thing is that Gasper actually never actually complained. In fact, he got along very well with both the dragons. The funniest thing was probably Valerie and Shirone, riding the dragons while they chased Gasper around the field.</p><p><br></p><p>In the last two months, several of my Dryads had evolved to the C+ Rank and now I could relax somewhat.</p><p><br></p><p>At this rate, I think I will be able to upgrade my farm in around three years.</p><p><br></p><p>Right now, I am working on something else entirely. Something to assist my other Skills, especially Life Magic and Touki - Senjutsu.</p><p><br></p><p>It was suggested by Euclid and Kuroka was a good teacher. There were still three years till I could upgrade my farm so I decided to try to learn this one on my own instead of using the System to learn it for a change and I have to say that the feeling was wonderful.</p><p><br></p><p>When used together, it gave me a lot of ideas about how to enhance my Life Magic.</p><p><br></p><p>Armin finished his training and came and sat beside me. “How is your training coming?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Good. The Underworld in general is not a good place for learning Senjutsu due to all the corruption nearby. This sub dimension is much better though. How does thirty times gravity feel?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am getting used to it. The gravity itself is not a problem but spending a long time here without reinforcing myself with Demonic Power can be stressful.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You could easily go to fifty though.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I can. I am just waiting for the others to get a bit stronger. In the meanwhile I will work on my Magic. Father is happy with my progress but as the next Head of the House, I need to practise my House magic as well.</p><p><br></p><p>“You look stressed? Did something happen?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>He let out a sigh and closed his eyes. “Tobio and the rest were quite worried lately. The supernatural scene in Japan has changed a lot.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh? What happened?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“You know the basic information about the Shinto, Youkai and the Onmyoji of Japan, right?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The most famous ones, yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“As you already know, members of the Five Principal clans are quite intolerant towards anything they consider different from them. As to how Akeno or recently Sona’s new Queen, Tsubaki Shinra were treated due to their lineage and Sacred Gears. In fact, even Tobio’s Grandmother was similar.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Exiled.” I supplied. “Yes. They do that a lot.” I replied, mildly disgusted. I mean what’s the child’s fault if they were not blessed by a Shinto Gods? They even exile those children.</p><p><br></p><p>Like dude, what the fuck.</p><p><br></p><p>Most Gods are known to be whimsical. One could wake up on the wrong side of the bed and send a plaque to the world. While this is often overlooked, in some cases, Gods have caused just as much if not even more destruction than Devils.</p><p><br></p><p>Just look at the Greeks.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Tobio’s Grandmother couldn’t use her Clan magic so she tried learning Buddhist ones and was exiled because of this.</p><p><br></p><p>“Now it’s come to bite them in their ass.” He scoffed.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at him questioningly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Those exiles formed an organisation of their own. The Utsusemi Organisation.”</p><p><br></p><p>… I suddenly had a very bad feeling in my gut.</p><p><br></p><p>Armin continued. “They had teamed up with the newly rogue Fallen Angel, Satanael and the Wizards of Oz Magician Organisation and kidnapped several people throughout their country and experimented on them to make some kind of human weapon of sorts.”</p><p><br></p><p>The bad feeling grew stronger.</p><p><br></p><p>“And then went on to attack the members of the Five Principal clans. There were heavy casualties. A large part of those clans were destroyed and even two of the inheritors of the Sacred Beasts died in the fight while two others were gravely injured but managed to escape somehow.”</p><p><br></p><p>Shit!</p><p><br></p><p>“The Fallen didn’t do anything? I had heard from Leila that Azazel was not the kind to allow such things and normally intervened somehow or the other.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah, about that. It was again the fault of the Principal Clans themselves. The shit with the Himejima Clan and Baraqiel’s wife was already a cause of anger but even when they were being butchered left and right, they didn’t allow anyone to interfere saying it was their personal matter. Those people had always used those exiles as a non liable resource. Good things were theirs and their faults had nothing to do with them.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But Satanael?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Didn’t show up until recently. No one knew of their connection.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It was a massive shit show. The Shinto finally intervened but their decision actually surprised everyone.”</p><p><br></p><p>I raised my eyebrow, urging him to continue.</p><p><br></p><p>“They actually proposed a deal to the exiles and offered them to take over the Principal Clans.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Say what?” I shouted, flabbergasted.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah, tell me. They were apparently trying to do so to maintain some modicum of balance.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Weren’t a majority of those exiles actually exiled because of not getting blessed by the Shinto?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Exactly. Too little too late. Those guys actually pretended to agree on a condition that they be compensated. Two divine blades of the Shinto Pantheons. And then they ran away.”</p><p><br></p><p>“… what?”</p><p><br></p><p>“They just got up and left. Only a handful of the members remained. And even they were being attacked by Youkai. The Shinto have become a running joke for everyone.” Armin sighed.</p><p><br></p><p>While I had my mouth open in shock.</p><p><br></p><p>This world was different. I already knew this. So, to think that all of this was my fault wasn’t exactly true but it still felt bad. Somewhat… those damn butterflies.</p><p><br></p><p>“I was out to bring the families of my peerage members to Devil Territories and even to other countries. It was a shitshow there. I think Lady Serafall is going to go there too to offer some help.”</p><p><br></p><p>“How are they filling up the power gap?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The Shinto are planning on creating a new group of Five Clans. Still, it will take them a long time to be established even with the leftover knowledge and properties of the previous ones. They are planning on offering rewards for anyone who can retrieve their swords or Sacred Beasts.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And the existing members?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Were all abandoned. All the blame was shifted onto them using the fact that they shared the same blood as the exiles and were also responsible for not managing the clans properly. Actually, they mostly fled to other countries or joined other factions. In fact, a part of them joined the Fallen Angels quite ironically.” He said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then how many Sacred Beasts do the Shinto have?”</p><p><br></p><p>“None. They are hunting for them.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Really, and to think those Principal Clans had served the Shinto for hundreds of years. And they call Devils treacherous.” I sighed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tell me about it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s stop thinking about these topics for a while. So, how are things at home?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Same old. Mother is actually searching for someone to engage me to someone so that the other houses will just shut up. It will at least keep quiet for a while. Father even asked me to search for someone if I wanted to. As long as they are Pure Blooded Devils, Pillars or Extra doesn’t matter. We just can’t give them any reason.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. Say, what about Extinct Pillars?” I asked, remembering about someone.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s… doable.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Great. I just happen to know someone.” I actually did.</p><p><br></p><p>I explained the situation to him. “Recently, a devil had come to stay in the Gremory territory. She was chased by an annoying fly. She needs a place to live peacefully. I think you both can help each other out. The fact that she is the actual or rather Lady of her House as of recently and that her house only became extinct due to falling into Bankruptcy could help.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Who are you talking about?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Lilitifa Vepar.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The Vepar. Yes, I have heard about them. They didn’t join any sides and were crushed in the battle during the Civil War. They were then sidelined by the Great King faction and couldn’t keep their house afloat due to the economic suppression. I didn’t know there were members alive.” He spoke while remembering the information he read.</p><p><br></p><p>“Basically she had moved on to the Human world in the Forneus Territory. And from there Graag Forneus has pursued her to bring her into his peerage. She is in a pinch right now. Yesterday, I came to know about this from Rias. You can ask your parents and see.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I… will tell mother about her.” He said, thinking for a while.</p><p><br></p><p>We talked about several things before it was time to eat so I went ahead to prepare.</p><p>_______________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“Where are we going?” I asked Rias as she led the way.</p><p><br></p><p>Lady and Lord Gremory wanted to talk to me about something too.</p><p><br></p><p>As soon as I came here, I was jumped by Rias who seemed quite excited and began to talk about some trip.</p><p><br></p><p>She invited me to come.</p><p><br></p><p>“Father’s going to Switzerland for some business. I am tagging along for a vacation. You haven’t been to the Human World, right? Come with us. It will be lots of fun.”</p><p><br></p><p>“She is not wrong, Mathias.” Another voice spoke from the side as Venelana entered the room followed by Zeoticus..</p><p><br></p><p>“Good Morning, Lady Gremory.” I greeted.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good Morning Mathias. As I was saying, you have been living alone for a long time. And even though you have your peerage members and friends living with you now, the fact remains that you haven’t left your territory. By doing so, you are missing a lot of important things a devil is responsible for.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Making contracts?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Exactly. Now, we know that you will be getting those in hordes when your identity is revealed but for now we are going to bring you around the Human World to get you familiar with it.” Zeoticus explained. </p><p><br></p><p>It did sound reasonable. From their point of view at least.</p><p><br></p><p>The human world’s knowledge was important for any Devil and while I knew a lot, there could be differences in this world too. Not to mention, I had no idea about the Supernatural side of things in the Human World. Something to learn about.</p><p><br></p><p>My peerage members will also need a place to make contracts. I can go and check the territories.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure. When do we have to go?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Tomorrow.You can inform your peerage members to hold the fort till then.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. I will be here by then.”</p><p><br></p><p>Back at the farm, I handed over the responsibilities to Armin and Ingvild and packed my stuff for the tour.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x_______________________________</p><p><br></p><p>Switzerland was beautiful.</p><p><br></p><p>It was also a place where the Devils currency was changed into human ones. Some of the banks here were run by gnomes. Yeah, turns out that slang did have a reason.</p><p><br></p><p>They were responsible for trading with all supernatural factions and changing their currencies with the human ones.</p><p><br></p><p>I too opened an account in the place. I mean I had a buttload of money and nowhere to spend so I decided to invest.</p><p><br></p><p>The year was 2002 and several good companies were going to spring up in the next few years and several more were going to rise. I instructed them to buy shares of a ton of companies which I could more or less remember who would rise in the next few years. Obviously, the names of these companies seemed to be parodies of the original ones so I had to work a bit. Still, a time well spent.</p><p><br></p><p>The Gremorys had an estate nearby and Zeoticus left one of his peerage members to teach me about how to make contracts with humans.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a relatively new experience, my first contract in fact.</p><p><br></p><p>Nothing special, just cook a meal for a lady who is often busy with her work.</p><p><br></p><p>She wanted to be my regular after that. We talked during the meal and I found that she was a business woman who actually traded food products across the world. She was here for some business deal. Such a coincidence, right? No way. It must be Zeoticus helping me out in expanding my business in the human world. </p><p><br></p><p>I established a contract with her as a regular. She said her name was Alina Muller. When I was well established in the Underworld, I intended to expand in the human world too. It would be better to lay a foundation starting from here.</p><p><br></p><p>The next day, I was free and was dragged by Rias to explore the nearby forests. Heinrich, Zeoticus’ bishop, was stationed to protect us but Zeoticus himself didn’t mind us exploring by ourselves.</p><p><br></p><p>According to him, if I couldn’t protect her, there would hardly be anything Heinrich could do.</p><p><br></p><p>It wasn’t a lie per say. Heinrich was a D+ Ranked, Magic focused Devil whose expertise lay in Alchemy. Fighting wasn’t exactly his thing. It’s just that, hardly anyone would attack once the Gremory name and by extension, Sirzechs’ name was put to the front. Most would just back away.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you think there would be any fairies in the area? Or Frost Giants? Or Jack Frost?” She asked excitedly as we explored the forests of the snow covered Swiss Alps. These forests were said to house some local spirits.</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t know about the fairies though. From what I know, they had retreated to their own sub dimension, Avalon, sometime during the Great War. They haven't been seen anywhere since then. As for the Frost Giants, they were wiped out by the Norse and I don’t think they even exist here anymore.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah… that sucks. Maybe if we are lucky, we can see the Wild Hunt.”</p><p><br></p><p>… If that happens, I am taking you and running at my fastest speed. I have no intention of fighting them here.</p><p><br></p><p>As we explored the area in peace, I smelled something in the distance.</p><p><br></p><p>Blood?</p><p><br></p><p>“Hold on, Rias. There is something ahead. Be careful, it might be dangerous.” I warned her. She became serious and backed away. I couldn’t smell anyone nearby. Only one scent came from the injured person, maybe someone got injured in the forest. “Let’s check it out.”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded and we carefully went forward and there we saw a figure laying on the snow, half covered by it. There was blood on the snow around them.</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly went forward and saw that the figure was that of a girl. Looked around eleven or twelve years old.</p><p><br></p><p>She had platinum blonde hair and a mole under her eye. She was freezing so I quickly made a fire near us to warm her up first.</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t think she will last.” I brought out a Senzu Bean from my inventory and tried feeding her but she was barely conscious and it was impossible for her to chew. So I crushed the bean and pushed it down her throat with my demonic power.</p><p><br></p><p>The bean took effect soon enough and she was regaining colour. She was still unconscious so we decided to bring her with us. Zeoticus was away but Heinrich was there and took care of the situation. The girl gained consciousness after a while.</p><p><br></p><p>And boy I wasn’t expecting this at all.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Great Red -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He watched from the Dimensional Gap as the brat of Izanami tore the Vermillion Bird out from the girl who was already on the verge of death. The other girl had the Black Turtle extracted from her already and was unconscious. She was in a better condition as she wasn’t injured but she was younger and thus was extremely weakened. She would most probably lose her life if not treated early.</p><p><br></p><p>The reason why he was even here was because he had seen Mathias make changes to the world. He just wanted to see how the world would look if one of the ‘Protagonists’ of the story was moved from their place. Safe to say that the result was not good.</p><p><br></p><p>A lot of it was the fault of those people themselves but things had changed a lot and these changes will bring further changes to the world.</p><p><br></p><p>Khaos Brigade or as it was originally called, the Chaos Brigade organisation was formed earlier than expected. Ophis was also tricked by them to join.</p><p><br></p><p>Really, Ophis was too gullible.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why? We have served you for centuries. Spread your name and worship you all. So why did you abandon us? Why didn’t you answer our calls for help? And now you come to even kill us when we are down.” The girl questioned as she lay dying.</p><p><br></p><p>“Your actions have shamed us. You share the blood of those traitors. You couldn’t keep them in check. And now the entire Shinto Pantheon has become a joke for the whole world. That Nakiri was actually working with those rebels for their help. You who have lost your faith do not deserve our mercy.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>With those words, he left, leaving those two dying alone.</p><p><br></p><p>The rage, sorrow and pain threatened to bleed out of her eyes as she finally broke down, letting out a shriek.</p><p><br></p><p>It had been like this for eons. Humans suffered at the whims of Gods.</p><p><br></p><p>And what could they do?</p><p><br></p><p>The God of the Bible did try to give them power but after his death, it turned into a double edged blade and harmed humans even more in some cases.</p><p><br></p><p>They were hunted by the Supernatural factions his followers in Church and Heaven included. Sometimes they just became outcasts. Many times, they went out of control and caused heavy destruction.</p><p><br></p><p>He wondered how the God of the Bible would have felt if he saw all this now, his gifts becoming a curse for the very humans he tried to protect. Even funnier was the fact that the only son who actually tried doing anything to keep that damage in control was the one who he kicked away for sleeping with a human.</p><p><br></p><p>Dragons are aloof creatures. They didn’t bother with ants. They only acted as they wanted and rarely listened to others.</p><p><br></p><p>He especially, didn’t even come to the Human World or any other world for that matter and spends his time in the Dimensional Gap.</p><p><br></p><p>Even today was just because of his own curiosity.</p><p><br></p><p>But this scene made him feel something. He understood what was happening. When you see a character you like die, you feel bad. He had read and seen everything in Mathias’ dreams and in doing so, he had developed some attachment to the so-called main characters.</p><p><br></p><p>And so, when he saw one of them die in front of him, he didn’t like it.</p><p><br></p><p>Dammit. This is why he didn’t associate himself with others.</p><p><br></p><p>But how can he allow this to happen? He is Great Red. And he won’t have a bad ending in his favourite show.</p><p><br></p><p>With this thought in his mind, he got to work. As for what to do with them?</p><p><br></p><p>All of them go to the one whose presence caused all these changes in the first place.</p><p><br></p><p>Knowing the guy, it was unlikely that he would turn them away after knowing what had happened.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Mathias -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the girl who was crying uncontrollably from when she woke up.</p><p><br></p><p>This world was really the same but at the same time different in several ways.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, the girl in front of me. Isla.</p><p><br></p><p>A survivor of the Holy Sword Project and the wielder of Sword Birth.</p><p><br></p><p>If there were doubts, they were almost removed due to her Sacred Gear.</p><p><br></p><p>She was supposed to be a he though.</p><p><br></p><p>The reason she was crying was because of the death of her friends in the Holy Sword Project facility.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly, I recalled something. Wasn’t there another girl who survived?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. There was still a chance.</p><p><br></p><p>With this thought, I got up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mathias?” Rias asked, seeing me leaving the room.</p><p><br></p><p>“I need to use the toilet.” I lied.</p><p><br></p><p>Entering my room, I shut the door and locked it and then directly teleported to the location we had found her.</p><p><br></p><p>The scent was still fresh and I followed it towards the facility. There were too many people there. It seems as if the experiment had not been caught by the church. Then again, that guy had the chance and time to make the Blessing using the Holy Sword factor extracted from the children which meant that there was still a bit of time before he got caught.</p><p><br></p><p>Which means I had the chance.</p><p><br></p><p>I made some insects to scout the area first to find the details. The result was out in fifteen minutes.</p><p><br></p><p>A girl had indeed survived but was sealed by her own Sacred Gear. They couldn’t release her so she was locked away in the basement. A few minutes later, my insects found the location of the basement. The first thing I searched for were any cameras but there were none.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, if there had been any cameras, they would have seen Isla being helped by other children to escape from there and could have caught her.</p><p><br></p><p>For once, I didn’t want to take any risk and directly used my Dream Magic to create a small hole in space and the girl easily slipped into the Dimensional Gap and then to me. There was not a trace of Demonic Power left in the place after all my insects came out.</p><p><br></p><p>I did leave one insect to blast the gas pipes to create a commotion to hide anything we might have left behind.</p><p><br></p><p>A perfect kidnapping….<em>cough</em> rescue.</p><p><br></p><p>We left the place soon after. I am pretty sure that my absence would have been noticed by now.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x_________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I was able to return before they could inform Zeoticus. The man did come back after an hour and I told him about what had happened. Bits of the story were edited though like, I just went out to see if there were any other survivors and was lucky to find one laying in the nearby snow. As for how she came there, it was none of my concern. It was much much more believable too as none of them would ever know that I had brought her straight from the Church’s facility.</p><p><br></p><p>She was sealed but that didn't prevent the first girl from thanking me profusely.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias didn't mind it either.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall, it was not a bad deal.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, to think a day of outing would lead to a random encounter.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x_________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I let Rias take the two girls with her. Isla wanted to come with me instead but agreed to go there with a promise that they could visit me anytime.</p><p><br></p><p>To be honest, I don't have the means to help them out right now.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe if my Dream Magic was a few grades higher then it might have been possible.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs and his peerage would have a better chance to help them.</p><p><br></p><p>Though, what was waiting for me in the farm was not at all expected.</p><p><br></p><p>\"And you found them laying on my bed?\" I asked in a monotonous voice.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Yes.\" Armin looked quite abashed.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Ingvild. \"Was there any letter somewhere?\"</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded and handed me the letter.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the seal on the letter and sure enough it was from him.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Are you sure it's safe, Matty? We don't even know who this letter is from. They got inside undetected by any of us. This could be dangerous.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I know who this is from. Did Tia visit?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Tiamat? Not that I am aware of.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I see. About this, don't worry. The guy is… a friend. I will tell you about him when you get a bit stronger. To be honest, I don't know if he would mind me telling anyone about him. So, let's keep it a secret for now. Just tell everyone that it was Tiamat.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"You… didn't get into any trouble, did you?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Not exactly. It's just… I will explain everything later. Just trust me on this one.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Alright, so… who are they?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"No idea. Will have to check when they wake up. Although, the girl is a dragon.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Umm… she looks a bit like Akeno.\"</p><p><br></p><p>I looked again and Ingvild was correct. She did look a bit similar.</p><p><br></p><p>“Also, what do you mean by she is a dragon?”</p><p><br></p><p>“She smells similar.” I said and used Observe on the girl.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>[Suzaku Himejima]</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>[Rank: D+]</strong></p><p><br></p><p>That’s… no wonder.</p><p><br></p><p>The other one was Genbu Domon.</p><p><br></p><p>These two were the ones who were missing from the Five Principal Clans.</p><p><br>Just what kind of a mess did Red get into this time?</p><p><br></p><p>I opened the letter and blanched. Ah, I suppose even I was slightly responsible for this mess. Very very slightly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is there something in there about who they are?” Armin asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“They… are Suzaku Himejima and Genbu Domon or rather former Suzaku Himejima and Genbu Domon. Their spirits are no longer there. It was extracted by Susanno and they were left to die. My… friend picked them up and brought them here.”</p><p><br></p><p>Armin had his mouth opened in shock. “But you said she was a dragon.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well… yeah. She was dying. The guy kinda did something to save her life. She is now a human-shaped dragon for all matters and purposes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“... I see. So… what now?”</p><p><br></p><p>“What else? I will go find Tia and tell her about this. Then we inform Sirzechs, Rias and Akeno. Oh and Tobio is apparently her second cousin. You should call him too. As for the other girl, <em>sigh</em> I don’t know.”</p><p><br></p><p>Can’t a guy just farm in peace?</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x_________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>The whole matter was a massive pain in the neck for everyone.</p><p><br></p><p>Especially after the church duo.</p><p><br></p><p>The only good thing was that Susanno had basically given up his and the Shinto Pantheon’s claim on her meaning that even if we recruited her, no one could question us or even blame any of us for this. They had no claim on them whatsoever.</p><p><br></p><p>Akeno apparently had a decent relationship with her.</p><p><br></p><p>Tobio didn’t even know her but was still supportive.</p><p><br></p><p>She decided to remain on my farm and join my peerage. I did give her the option to join Rias’ or Armin’s peerage because she had family members there but she had a deal with ‘the voice’ to join me and in return he would grant her a chance to meet her family once more.</p><p><br></p><p>The hell.</p><p><br></p><p>Who was the devil here? Red or me?</p><p><br></p><p>As for the other girl, she stayed on my farm too but actually joined Latia’s peerage.</p><p><br></p><p>Oh and since they were no longer inheritors of the Sacred Beasts, they changed their names back to what it used to be. Suzaku became Shizuka and Genbu became Kanna.</p><p><br></p><p>Tia also concluded that Shizuka might have had her body reconstructed using great Red’s flesh of all things.</p><p><br></p><p>Was Red also inspired by the Light Novels?</p><p><br></p><p>Anyways, she has gained a lot of power and this power will only grow higher with training. Well, she didn’t lack motivation in any way. She trained like she was possessed by something.</p><p><br></p><p>Both of them had lost any faith in the Shinto Gods.</p><p><br></p><p>Making people lose faith in their Gods. You know what, I guess I really am a devil.</p><p><br></p><p>She reminded me of Lavinia when she first came here. The only thing better was that she had family… well kinda family to support her though.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, for someone who had lived her entire life believing in Gods, to receive such an end… Now her life’s only goal was to protect her remaining family.</p><p><br></p><p>Compared to her, the church duo were much better. They were grieving for their friends but were much better since they had one another. </p><p><br></p><p>I asked Leila to take all of the new four members for therapy. They definitely needed it after something like this.</p><p><br></p><p>Anyways, we decided to remain on the farm for the next few months to not attract any attention.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Latia Astaroth -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She relaxed in the hot springs, letting her sore body rest after the day-long training.</p><p><br></p><p>“How did Mathias do all this since he was twelve? I felt as if my body would give up after just a day.” Rias complained. To some degree, she agreed with it too.</p><p><br></p><p>She did feel the same for the first few days. Especially because she had mainly concentrated on her magical abilities before that and was only taught the basics of martial arts to protect herself.</p><p><br></p><p>That was what most of the Devils did. After all, what was the use of spending so much time on physical abilities when they could just use Demonic Power to reinforce themselves to the same level? They were Devils not dragons.</p><p><br></p><p>But this fact was changed by Mathias. Although it could be argued that he, due to his Buné heritage, was an exception, but then Armin’s as well as Sairaorg’s results came in and slapped those arguments out of the way.</p><p><br></p><p>They had attained a level which most devils could only imagine with the help of pure physical training. The fact that their Magical Powers only boosted those levels was a cherry on the top too.</p><p><br></p><p>Most of the young Devils her age had dreams.</p><p><br></p><p>Sona wanted to open a Rating Game School of children of all classes.</p><p><br></p><p>Seekvaria wanted to make Gundam and Mecha famous in the Underworld.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias wanted to become the Rating Game Champion.</p><p><br></p><p>As for her, she wanted to run the most successful business in the Underworld. She appreciated how her parents worked together to run their own business and had always loved their teamwork. One day, she wanted to have a similar partnership with her life partner.</p><p><br></p><p>Mathias knew this and supported her. He actually told her that he would love to have such an arrangement where he could concentrate on his farm work while she handled the business and Rias agreed as she wanted to pursue her dream of being the Rating Game champion herself.</p><p><br></p><p>In a way, this engagement was good for everyone.</p><p><br></p><p>Although she would never say it out loud, she had come to appreciate their company as well.</p><p><br></p><p>Mathias was different from other boys their age who had their heads up in the clouds and Rias didn’t have a scheming bone in her body. They were people with whom she didn’t have to keep up her guard as she was taught to do. It was refreshing.</p><p><br></p><p>She could see herself living this life happily in the future.</p><p><br></p><p>But now, as things changed, she realised that things might not be so simple.</p><p><br></p><p>The amount of proposals Armin was getting was an eye opener. People were bringing contracts for the position of wives and even concubines for him. And when she thought of what would happen when Mathias’ heritage and then powers were revealed, she couldn’t help but feel uncomfortable.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a given that he would be hounded by girls and most of them would be from good families. Not to mention, they all are going to come after him like they mean business.</p><p><br></p><p>Mathias will be a young Devil with a Dragon lineage to boot. There was always a chance that he could slip and then some hussy might try to wedge herself in their happy and peaceful future life.</p><p><br></p><p>She was absolutely not going to let that happen.</p><p><br></p><p>Although it was normal for Devils to have harems, Heads of Houses more so than normal, especially someone in Mathias’ position who was trying to bring his House back from the brink of extinction, so she knew that there would be other girls she will have to share him with as not doing so would be detrimental to their House.</p><p><br></p><p>But… she could always take a middle path and ward off the gold diggers so that their peaceful life is not disturbed.</p><p><br></p><p>She had asked her mother for advice but was told to figure out the dynamics of the relationship among themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>First she had a talk with Rias. It took some time to explain things to her as she was more emotion driven, but she did get the point.</p><p><br></p><p>Then they asked Venelana, Rias’ mother for help. She had shared her experiences on how she managed her husband’s harem. She being the Lady of the House could tell them more about their situation and how they should handle it.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally both of them had come to a conclusion.</p><p><br></p><p>They were going to push girls who could be trusted and had genuine feelings for Mathias towards him.</p><p><br></p><p>No one would force anything.</p><p><br></p><p>If they click, everything will be fine. If not, then no harm done. They could always see another girl.</p><p><br></p><p>And the first targets were quite conveniently in front of them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ingvild, Lavinia, can I ask you two a question?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, sure.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you like Mathias?”</p><p><br></p><p>The purple haired girl blushed to her ears while the blonde just smiled. While the other girls in the bath listened with keen interest about the matter.</p><p><br></p><p>“I do.” Lavinia answered simply, eliciting surprises from most of the people.</p><p><br></p><p>Well, at least one of them didn’t shy away.</p><p><br></p><p>Now for the hard part.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Serafall -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“How was your visit?” Sirzechs asked as the meeting started.</p><p><br></p><p>“Not good. The Shinto are still pissed off. They are coming down on everyone regardless of faction or treaties. It has displeased several other supernatural groups who have business in Japan. Not to mention, those rebels have completely disappeared from the country with three Sacred Beasts. We might have a terrorist organisation on our hands soon enough. Satanael is a part of the organisation too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Azazel?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Is running damage control. He had actually tried to intervene much earlier but was stopped by the Principal Clans due to their damned pride.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well they paid for it with their lives. How are the new Clans chosen to replace them?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The Shinto just choose the largest Clans apart from the Principal Clans to take their place after giving them their blessings.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Wouldn’t have come to this if they hadn’t been sitting on their asses all this time and actually worked properly.” Falbium scoffed.</p><p><br></p><p>He wasn’t wrong either, so…</p><p><br></p><p>“What about our territories? We had agreements with them. Are they going back on their words?” Sirzechs asked, seriously.</p><p><br></p><p>“They can’t afford to do that or they would burn bridges with too many people. But they are restricting businesses for many. I think your father’s businesses were affected by those too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. He has been tense for the last few weeks. We had several hotels and properties in big towns and cities of Japan.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The Youkai are on edge too. If this goes on, sooner or later, there will be a civil war among them.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What about those girls brought back by Mathias?”</p><p><br></p><p>\"They want nothing to do with the Shinto. According to them, the Ouryu was working with Sataneel to find a way to help his sister control his Sacred Gear, the Telos Karma. Not to mention, they had the Incinerate Anthem with them. So whatever that group is, they have at least two Longinus with them.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hmm, that's quite worrying. Do we have any information about them?\" Sirzechs asked but she just shook her head in reply.</p><p><br></p><p>\"What about the Holy Sword Project?\" Falbium asked.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Yes, that's another problem. Thankfully, it was solved quite easily. I spread the information about the Holy Sword Project and the massacre of the children in several places. The Church obviously tried to deny the allegations but there were just too many pointed fingers and the project was exposed. I think they were buying time till they completed the project first so that they can get the results before washing their hands off of those people. I don't know if they succeeded though.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"At least they will be under surveillance for a while and cause less trouble for us.\"</p><p><br></p><p>“Funny thing was that the Shinto are actually coming down on the Church to return their Holy Swords which they had usurped a while ago. The Ame No Murakumo was in the hands of a Church exorcist previously. If they don’t comply, they would probably use it as an excuse to oust them out of some of their territories. It will give them a legitimate reason to do so. They are caught in a pinch.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The current Japan is a powder keg waiting to be lit. I think Armin just moved away the family members of all his peerage members to different countries.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Tsubaki-chan was quite sad. She did have some people there who treated her well. Sona wanted to go there for her High School years but I think it would be better to send them somewhere else. What about Rias?”</p><p><br></p><p>“She has decided to stay in the Underworld and operate from here. All of them have been spending time on the farm and want to work for it. There were talks about expanding the farm and making preparations for cleaning the area taken over by the Demonic Beasts. Currently they spend most of their time training.”</p><p><br></p><p>“They are really going at it, aren’t they? Armin only returns home once every month. Mother has been constantly hounding me about this.” Falbium sighed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hehehehe. Yes, being the most eligible bachelor of the younger generation is a pain in the neck. I am surprised Lady Glasya-Labolas isn’t chasing the ones proposing marriage away with a stick in her hand.” She laughed. The fact that there was a slight chance it might actually happen was equally funny.</p><p><br></p><p>“Apparently, Mother has found someone recently on Armin’s suggestion. I don’t know who but that side of the problem will be handled. Father for that matter isn’t worried at all.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Heh! Lady Glasya-Labolas works fast.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You tell me.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Mathias -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the girls on either side of me.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, what brought this on? Don’t tell me this is about Latia and her plan? You don’t have to do this, you know.” I assured them.</p><p><br></p><p>Really, I had no idea how that girl got such ideas. I knew better than to think with my dick, especially in the Underworld.</p><p><br></p><p>“We are doing this because we wanted to. I for one didn’t want to do this without talking with them first because they are going to be engaged to you. But now that they don’t mind, there is nothing stopping me.” Lavina spoke. To be honest, the fact that she wasn’t throwing around her air-headed self was evident of the fact that she was very serious.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ingvild?”</p><p><br></p><p>The girl flushed and bowed her head, looking at her feet.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t bully her, Matty. You want her to propose to you?” Lavinia scolded me and I realised my mistake.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl was here of her own will, which was saying a lot for someone as shy as her. To force her to word out everything was kinda bullying so I changed my question.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are not doing this against your will, are you? You both are amazing girls who would make anyone lucky to have you as a partner, let alone both of you but… I need to know that you are not doing things under any kind of obligation or any other similar thoughts.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I… I don’t mind. I want to do this.” She stuttered a bit.</p><p><br></p><p>Well, that’s good then.</p><p><br></p><p>I won’t be a hypocrite. Who wouldn’t want to live with such cute girls? It’s just that I didn't want them to think of this as a way to repay me for something. That kind of relationship never ends well for anyone.</p><p><br></p><p>All these years in the Underworld has made me understand that people had a different way of living in the place. Harems were actually more common than people around here realise.</p><p><br></p><p>The fact that even Leila and Venelana of all people made me sit and explained this was telling. I was getting engaged to their daughters.</p><p><br></p><p>According to them, the only thing I had to pay attention to was to not get any other pure blood devil girls pregnant before Rias and Latia. Those could lead to succession issues and were better avoided no matter what.</p><p><br></p><p>So many things to pay attention to.</p><p><br></p><p>Not to mention my Dragon side has some effect on me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s take this at our own pace, shall we?” I tried to break the awkward silence which was developing in the room. They nodded and just lay in the bed on each side of me.</p><p><br></p><p>Ingvild was shy but Lavinia didn’t mind as she clung to me.</p><p><br></p><p>So I took the initiative and hugged Ingvild to my other side.</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah… this is comfortable.</p><p><br></p><p>I will have to spend more time with Latia and Rias so they don’t feel left out.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Tiamat -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She watched as the hatchlings trained against each other in this new dimension which Mathias had created for training. He called it the 10G Mountains.</p><p><br></p><p>Creating an entire sub dimension like this with its own gravity was a massive feat only those extremely well versed in magic like Ajuka could do.</p><p><br></p><p>It was much more complicated than just creating Rating Game dimensions because these types of dimensions were permanent and more stable.</p><p><br></p><p>The sound of an explosion attracted her attention. In one of the corners of the dimension, near the edges, the new girl was training.</p><p><br></p><p>It was still hard for her to believe that <em>he</em> would do such a thing for someone.</p><p><br></p><p>Was there something special about this girl? Or was it just a whim once more?</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, from what Mathias had said, this was not the only time he had done something like this. There was once that he did something similar. And that event resulted in her own creation.</p><p><br></p><p>Another thing which she didn’t understand was how he got interested in Mathias. Did he know about <em>him</em> already? About <em>it</em>? Was that why he was keeping an eye on him?</p><p><br></p><p>But according to Mathias, his Appetite Demon must have only recently awakened.</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, no one knew exactly what he was capable of.</p><p><br></p><p>But whatever the matter it doesn’t change the fact that this girl was now basically a hatchling of the Dragon of Dreams.</p><p><br></p><p>The amount of people who would be after her after finding this out would be insane. The Shinto… especially the Shinto. Do they even realise just what kind of enemy they had created for themselves out of sheer pettiness?</p><p><br></p><p>Probably not or they would have been trying to get her back. Not that they would have a chance anyway. Mathias wouldn’t give her up. He was extremely stubborn that way.</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, if the girl was trained well, she could become a massive support for him. She did seem extremely loyal to him somehow.</p><p><br></p><p>People who lose their faith always latch on to the next pillar of support they can find. This was true for most of the races and not just humans.</p><p><br></p><p>And weren’t the Buné Dragon Tamers?</p><p><br></p><p>The boy doesn’t realise it yet but he is already stronger than most people in this world. It’s just that due to his unique case, he needed to be stronger.</p><p><br></p><p>Once people realise the true extent of his abilities, the only thing which will protect him is strength and the support of more people.</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, at the rate at which he was progressing, it wouldn’t take much longer for him to reach such a level. And with the support of his creations, he could be truly safe. To achieve this, she wanted to assist him as well.</p><p><br></p><p>It wouldn’t look good if her so-called King was harmed by others, right? And if in doing so, she can pay her debts off to Great Red for giving her life, then all the better. WIth these thoughts in mind, she walked towards the girl who was currently laying on the ground, trying to grasp her breath.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you want to get stronger?” She offered the girl her hand.</p><p><br></p><p>____________________________x_________________________________________________________x_____________________________</p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I have started posting advanced chapters on my Patreon, Feel free to join if you want to.</strong></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server </strong><a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><strong>So, I decided to let the Butterflies flap their wings this time.</strong></p><p><strong>Most of the stories I read have future events just as they were with no changes to it no matter how much the plot is changed.</strong></p><p><strong>While some things might remain the same, most of the things change if such major plot changes are made.</strong></p><p><strong>I tried to show an angle on what might have happened if things had been slightly different and there was no plot armour to save the day.</strong></p><p><strong>Mathias has his first trip to the Human World.</strong></p><p><strong>I tried to show how business was run in the Supernatural world and how it was connected to the Human World.

His bloodlust washed over me and I realised why he was called an <em>Evil</em> Dragon and the strongest one of them all.</p><p><br></p><p>The pressure he released was stronger than the previous Tiamat.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes… previous Tiamat.</p><p><br></p><p>I am pretty sure that despite having the same Rank according to the System, Tia could kick his ass every day till Sunday. But, all of this was not my concern. Right now I just wanted to hit something bad.</p><p><br></p><p>Was this a Dragon's fighting instinct?</p><p><br></p><p>\"Start whenever you are ready. Don't waste my time.\" He spoke gruffly and I found myself slightly annoyed at the tone.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Sure. You asked for it.\" I took a deep breath as my Touki flared and I kicked the ground shooting towards him.</p><p><br></p><p>I saw his eyes widening slightly but he raised a hand and punched.</p><p><br></p><p>Two fists met and the blast of energy caused the nearby trees to be uprooted and fly.</p><p><br></p><p>I couldn't even move him back slightly. On the other hand, I felt my bones get rattled from that clash as I was pushed back as a result.</p><p><br></p><p>I pushed my Touki to its peak and my body took on some dragonic characteristics.</p><p><br></p><p>Half Dragonification.</p><p><br></p><p>I punched again and this time, the blow matched his evenly.</p><p><br></p><p>\"You are a dragon?\" He asked, surprised at my sudden changes.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I am a Buné. We are related to Dragon's… Well sorta.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Doesn't matter. You are a dragon and can fight me. That's enough.\" His aura flared as he charged towards me.</p><p><br></p><p>I utilised my Touki to the fullest to match his punches and soon realised that Crom Crauch was a master in Martial Arts too. I currently possess a B+ Rank in Martial Arts and could barely keep up with him, but maybe a part of it was due to his ridiculous power while mine still lagged behind by a little.</p><p><br></p><p>This was the first time I was lagging in a physical fight in terms of stats and yet I didn't want to use magic today.</p><p><br></p><p>My blood was boiling over and I just wanted to break things with my fists.</p><p><br></p><p>And I did just that.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>– Tiamat –</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She looked on in amazement as the two fought in front of her. The shockwaves from their punches, blowing her long blue hair while the nearby trees had already been destroyed as soon as the fight started. Each of those clashes were like explosions going off.</p><p><br></p><p>The little hatchlings in the place were all hidden while a few courageous ones peeked out from behind the unbroken rocks.</p><p><br></p><p>This was a fight between Dragons in the raw without any filters.</p><p><br></p><p>She noticed it at first when he asked for the fight but there was really something wrong with Mathias today.</p><p><br></p><p>He was really venting out in this fight. There was no magic used except for the occasional Dragonfire and truth be told, his power surprised even her. She wasn't sure that she could fight him if she had been her previous self. It seemed that he <em>was</em> training for their fight and she couldn't slack either if she didn't want to throw the match.</p><p><br></p><p>Around an hour later, two large dragons stood in the middle of the ground, one black with golden tribal markings while the other red with golden parts.</p><p><br></p><p>They were almost equal in size with Crom being slightly larger due to his age but to think Mathias would be able to almost match him was nothing short of a miracle. Even the likes of Sirzechs and Ajuka didn’t reach this level of power till they reached their fifties.</p><p><br></p><p>Although, he was not up to the mark yet because she could see that he was only keeping up with the older dragon due to his Touki. Once he ran out, he would be at a disadvantage. Then again, if he used his Magics, it would be a different case.</p><p><br></p><p>After all, while Life Magic is unpredictable, Mathias’ real trump card was <em>that</em> magic.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, she had only seen him using that magic a few times in a fight against her and his mastery in the said magic was increasing at an unimaginable rate.</p><p><br></p><p>She noticed that in his Dragon form, he was fighting on instinct rather than knowing how to fight in a body he was not used to. He took some hits but was making up for it with his increased Touki output.</p><p><br></p><p>This however put him in more of a disadvantage in the long run as he was losing energy faster than normal.</p><p><br></p><p>The difference became evident after a few hours when he was thrown back against the walls of the barriers.</p><p><br></p><p>The black dragon was not unhurt either. She could see that he had almost had his arm ripped off in the fight and it was dangling on the side but it didn’t stop him from continuing.</p><p><br></p><p>This fight reminded her of the times those two idiots fought against each other, causing destruction all over the place.</p><p><br></p><p>They both reverted to their human forms and Crom, while shakily walking towards him.</p><p><br></p><p>Tiamat realised this and was quick to move forward to interrupt the Evil Dragon if he tried to do something harmful to Mathias only for her senses to scream at her to run away.</p><p><br></p><p>Her neck snapped in the direction of the feeling and she was surprised that it was not coming from the Evil Dragon himself as even he was rooted to the ground, looking at the source of the feeling.</p><p><br></p><p>It was coming from Mathias over whom a reddish aura which slowly took the form of a being, a reptilian lifeform of enormous size.</p><p><br></p><p>Infact, the size of this beast made her look tiny in comparison.</p><p><br></p><p>The form became clearer and she saw it.</p><p><br></p><p>A Dragon of mastodonic size and extremely muscular body structure befitting its size. This dragon was beyond anything she had ever seen or even heard of. It possessed five pairs of slitted eyes and four digits with claws the size enough to grab and topple over mountains. The sides of its neck and the top of its head had sharp rows of spikes over them, its wings also sported spikes along their leading edges. Its most notable trait lay in its mouth which was completely devoid of teeth except for its one enormous tusk-like fang which gave off a very terrifying aura and its bottom lip was parted in a certain way for its massive tooth to fit. Also of note is that it had a large number of tendril-like tongues.</p><p><br></p><p>It just eyed her and every instinct in her body was screaming at her to run. A sort of primal fear enveloping her towards this beast which seemed as if it was a king.</p><p><br></p><p>Her body turned into her Dragon form as she roared at it in defiance only to find herself not being able to vocalise any kind of sound.</p><p><br></p><p>She remained utterly rooted in her place until the figure dispersed and she fell down to her knees.</p><p><br></p><p>What in the name of Ophis was that thing?</p><p><br></p><p>It took her a few seconds to gather her beating heart.</p><p><br></p><p>She was broken out of her daze by the aura from the Evil Dragon who seemed to have collected himself too and was now heading towards Mathias.</p><p><br></p><p>She reached him faster and stood in front of him. “What do you want, Crom Cruach? The fight is over. You won. If you want to fight more, heal yourself and I will accompany you.” She brought out a vial of the Phenex Tears from her clothes and threw it at him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Get out of my way Tiamat. This brat… he was holding back on me. He was holding <em>that</em> kind of power. <em>How dare he</em>?” It growled.</p><p><br></p><p>“He was not holding back anything. I doubt he even knew what that thing was or if he had it so control yourself.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What do you mean he didn’t know?” He lashed out.</p><p><br></p><p>“He didn’t have this power before. It must have awakened right now. So if you want answers, you will have to wait until he wakes up. That said, If you try to harm even a hair on his head….<strong><em>I will end you no matter the cost.</em></strong>”</p><p><br></p><p>Water and fire gathered around her as she roared.</p><p><br></p><p>The little ones in the area had already fainted when it came out so there was no worry of scaring them.</p><p><br></p><p>The Evil Dragon roared back in defiance and she stood her ground.</p><p><br></p><p>A few seconds later, it kicked the ground in rage and turned towards the gates. “I am done with the fight. Tell the boy, I will return later for another one and I won’t forgive him if he holds back on me.”</p><p><br></p><p>Tiamat waited until he was gone and then picked up Mathias and carried him to her place.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Great Red -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>For the second time in recent years, he had felt danger.</p><p><br></p><p>As he expected, Crom Cruach had reached Tiamat for the fight he so craved.</p><p><br></p><p>The intervention of Mathias was a surprise but not an unpleasant one. He had come a long way and quite fast.</p><p><br></p><p>Although he was a bit miffed that he didn’t use any magic during the fight, it seemed like he was just venting out some kind of frustration and using one’s body in such a situation feels the best.</p><p><br></p><p>It took him a few moments to look into the cause of the behaviour.</p><p><br></p><p>His parents… oh.</p><p><br></p><p>To be honest, he would have just blown the ones responsible for it up but from what he remembered from the memories, that place had two of the so-called <em>main characters</em> of this world so he let what was happening happen. If Mathias wanted to leave it to the four Devils, he would respect the boy’s decision.</p><p><br></p><p>The thing he was not expecting was that Dragon.</p><p><br></p><p>He had seen it in his memories. In that anime called Toriko.</p><p><br></p><p>Watching the memories of a different world was one of his favourite pastimes. The only reason he remembered the name of this one was because many of the plants and animals on Mathias’ farm were from this Torkio world so he had searched for more of the information regarding this world.</p><p><br></p><p>And there was no doubting it.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a Derous. The same one as one of the Eight Kings, the Dragon King Derous.</p><p><br></p><p>Now the question was if it was just an illusion or… a Gourmet Demon?</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Due to his timely interference, no one outside the place could sense its presence.</p><p><br></p><p>Things just got more interesting and after what seemed an absurdly long time.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Mathias -</strong> </p><p><br></p><p>I woke up to find Tiamat’s face looking at me.</p><p><br></p><p>A second later, I remembered what had happened yesterday and got up quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did I faint?”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“I lost, didn’t I?”</p><p><br></p><p>“You did.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That guy was strong.” I replied while laying back in her lap.</p><p><br></p><p>If she was offering, who was I to deny? She didn’t mind it either.</p><p><br></p><p>“You weren’t too bad either. Especially at the end.”</p><p><br></p><p>End?</p><p><br></p><p>“What end?”</p><p><br></p><p>“When you made the illusion of that giant Dragon with thousands of tentacle like tongues?”</p><p><br></p><p>What illusion? Also, why does it sound like a Hentai demon?</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at my stats to check what she was talking about and the new entry made everything clear.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Host: Mathias Buné</strong></p><p><strong>Title: The Poor Noble, Pure Blooded Devil, The Farmer</strong></p><p><strong>Age: 16 years old. </strong></p><p><strong>Body: B+</strong></p><p><strong>Mind: B+</strong></p><p><strong>Spirit: B+</strong></p><p><strong>Magic: B+</strong></p><p><strong>Luck: B+</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Skills:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Buné Clan Trait:</strong></p><p><strong>Dragon Taming: B+</strong></p><p><strong>Dragonification: B+</strong></p><p><strong>Dragonfire: B+</strong></p><p><strong>Dragon's Aura: B+</strong></p><p><strong>Dream Manipulation: B+</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Zagan Clan Trait:</strong></p><p><strong>Life Magic: B+</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Gourmet Cells: E+</strong></p><p><strong>Gourmet Demon: Derous, S+[E+]</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Magic:</strong></p><p><strong>Teleportation: C+</strong></p><p><strong>Bounded Field Creation: B+</strong></p><p><strong>Memory Alteration: C+</strong></p><p><strong>Barrier Magic: B+</strong></p><p><strong>Spatial Magic: B+</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Martial Arts: B+</strong></p><p><strong>Touki: B+</strong></p><p><strong>Cooking: B+</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Abnormality Resistance: B+</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Farm Management</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Farm Rank: B</strong></p><p><strong>Farming Points: 78,512.</strong></p><p><strong>Money: 72,569,000Ⱡ</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Shop</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Inventory</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Gourmet Cells? Gourmet Demons too?</p><p><br></p><p>The skills were different though.</p><p><br></p><p>While my Gourmet Demon made me do a double-take when I saw its grade, I still couldn’t use its power fully. It would simply suck me dry in a single moment of full power use and that was assuming that I <em>could</em> use it with my current level..</p><p><br></p><p>I needed a higher level of Gourmet Cells to use its power. Thus the Skill itself was capped at the level of my Gourmet Cells.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, this wouldn’t have been a problem if not for the extra note added to the Gourmet Cells. I was advised to increase the Skill by eating a higher grade of food with the regular method instead of using the System because the Skills use Gourmet Energy and they have extremely high energy usage. I would need a better supply of food to use them efficiently.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean I could increase the levels with my System but if I don’t find enough food for myself to keep those Gourmet Cells active, it will only backfire.</p><p><br></p><p>A good thing was that the Gourmet Cells provided a passive boost just by existing and the boost would only increase as time went on.</p><p><br></p><p>While it didn’t show in my stats, I could feel my strength increase by a large margin. My durability had increased and then came the question of Tiamat.</p><p><br></p><p>The answer was right in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>Derous, The Dragon King of the Eight Kings.</p><p><br></p><p>To think I would have <em>that</em> as a Gourmet Demon or a Gourmet Dragon, I suppose.</p><p><br></p><p>“What happened?” She asked, seeing me not answering.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah… I was checking my body for any changes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Anything wrong? I did check but I am not exactly an expert.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Nothing. In fact, I think the fight seems to have pushed me to break through my limit. It was still an experimental thing so I was not sure when it would work but it did.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What exactly are you talking about?” She asked, narrowing her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, let me explain it in simpler terms. You know how some of my food increases cell activity. What I was trying to see was if eating a higher grade of my crops would make any kind of qualitative change in the cell structure. My bet paid off and I am stronger now? After reaching a certain amount of cell activity, depending on the type of food we eat and their suitability with our DNA, there is a chance that our Cells can break the limits and go beyond their current previous selves. Think of it as an Angel gaining a wing of sorts. They don’t necessarily change races but become stronger and better than their previous selves.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you mean like Sirzechs and his True Form?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, hard to say since I haven’t seen his true form but I doubt it. The changes are at a cellular level sure but it doesn’t mean they can become as strong as Sirzechs in one go.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So what was that Dragon?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It was… how do I say this… he was kinda my inner demon or inner spirit in a way. I only theorised this but if someone’s soul is strong enough and their body matches the strength, they can host an inner spirit. Although the chances of it are even rarer than awakening the cells. Like if one in a million people can awaken their Gourmet Cells, then one among <em>those</em> million people would be able to host a Spirit of their own. They take a lot of energy but you can think of them as sort of Sacred Gear spirits inside a person or even better one of those Divine Spirits which the Five Principal clan members use in Japan but they use my energy to use their powers. So if I cannot provide them with enough energy, they would be useless.”</p><p><br></p><p>Tiamat had a complicated expression on her face. “I wouldn’t say that it is useless. Even the sight of that being made me feel the chills.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Really?!” I asked, surprised. I mean I knew that it was probably the highest Ranked thing I owned or had ever seen but still for her to say something like that…</p><p><br></p><p>She just nodded but didn’t speak any further so I didn’t probe either.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, what got you all riled up yesterday?” She asked, making me remember the incidents of yesterday.</p><p><br></p><p>I became quiet.</p><p><br></p><p>She caressed my hair and waited for me to speak.</p><p><br></p><p>“My parents… they were murdered.”</p><p><br></p><p>Her hand paused for a moment but she continued and so did I. “There was an experimental facility in the pits where some members of the Naberius house were running illegal experiments to create Super Devils. It was why those Demonic Beasts had become so frequent. They were experimental products. My parents and their peerages had found the facility but were captured and experimented on.”</p><p><br></p><p>I became quiet.</p><p><br></p><p>I was calm. The sleep and the fight calmed me enough to speak freely but it still felt bad thinking about it.</p><p><br></p><p>“What of those Naberius?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I… had a talk with the head and found out the location of my parents’ bodies. He and his subordinates are in prison. I… made sure that he would never do anything like that… ever again.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Good.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sirzechs and the rest will be raiding the research facility in the Naberius territory and recovering the bodies of my parents. I wasn’t sure I would have been able to control myself so I let them take care of it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You did the right thing.” A few moments later she added. “Do you want to kill them?”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked back at her and shook my head. “No… that would be too kind to them. I already gave the head a punishment worse than death.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Good.”</p><p><br></p><p>I spoke after a few minutes of silence. “There was a chance they were alive. If only I had informed others earlier…”</p><p><br></p><p>“You couldn’t have known. Moreover, it was the job of your maid, not yours. You couldn’t even have known. Not to mention, there was a chance that someone wrong could have found out about it and tried to silence you first.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p><br></p><p>Right.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t even know if they were dead or alive when I woke up in this body.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t say anything and closed my eyes and drifted off to sleep.</p><p><br></p><p>The wounds from the previous day were healing. I didn’t take any healing aids but I was still recovering faster than before. Nothing ultra fast but still better than before. The Gourmet Cells really are something.</p><p><br></p><p></p><p></p><p><br></p><p>\"Matty, what happened to you? Are you alright?\" I saw Armin running towards me.</p><p><br></p><p>Lavinia and Ingvild looked worried too. I didn't see the others but they might be inside.</p><p><br></p><p>There were a few people with him whom I didn't recognize either.</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I found out from my brother and came as fast as I could. What happened to you, how did you get injured?” He said, looking at my wounds.</p><p><br></p><p>I was not completely healed because I didn’t use any healing aid because I didn’t feel any urgent need to do so.</p><p><br></p><p>“I was sparring. Don’t worry. I am fine.” I shook my head with a light smile.</p><p><br></p><p>Venting out and a good sleep made me think clearer now.</p><p><br></p><p>“About your parents… I’m sorry.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s not your fault, Armin. Don’t be.” I said as we walked towards the house.</p><p><br></p><p>Lavinia and Ingvild asked me about my condition too. Apparently, they had visited the place where we had spared and the destruction of the place scared them. Then not finding me had worried them even more. I told them about what happened and it took me some time to calm them down.</p><p><br></p><p>“Matty, are you sure…”</p><p><br></p><p>“I got myself adjusted to the facts for years now, Armin. This was something out of the blue but not something that would change the main things. My parents are gone. They won’t be coming back whether I go and kill each and everyone involved or not. I saw to it that they get punished. All I need to do now is to see that my parents get a proper funeral. Let’s stop this discussion for now.”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, who are the new faces?” I asked, looking at the people behind him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, they are my new peerage members. Well, half of them at least.” I raised an eyebrow and he explained. “Tobio is my new Queen. Kouki is my new Knight and Hyousuke is my new rook. Shigune is my newest pawn who took three pieces to reincarnate. Natsume on the other hand doesn’t wish to participate in Rating Games much so she didn’t join my peerage. I brought her here to see if you needed a peerage member. I mean, you are not planning to actively participate in Rating Games either so your plans match. You get a strong Peerage Member and she gets the protection she wants.” He said pointing towards the girl who bowed lightly.</p><p><br></p><p>She was nervous.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, sure. But you also know the work we do here. Are you sure she would be willing to do so?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.” The girl answered for herself. “Armin-san has explained about your business after we signed a contract of confidentiality. I don’t like fighting much and I think this job suits me quite well.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at her for a few moments. “In that case, you can stay here for a few days and see how things work here. If you agree to join after that, I will have no problems. I just don’t want you to regret your choice later on.”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded and others seemed to have heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p><br></p><p>Were they worried about her?</p><p><br></p><p>They were shown around the outer farm by Ingvild while Armin and I talked to each other about yesterday.</p><p><br></p><p>He explained how he recruited them, which was basically explaining everything about their situation. The human world, the supernatural world, what they carried, what was the significance of their Sacred Gears and how others would react to it, especially Tobio and then about the Devil society in general.</p><p><br></p><p>Armin then visited them regularly and frankly talked to them about everything which their joining his peerage would entail.</p><p><br></p><p>They joined his peerage finally when he promised the safety of their families under the name of his House and the Satan Asmodeus.</p><p><br></p><p>Funny thing is that Shigune also didn’t want to fight much but she still joined his peerage because of Hyousuke Koga who was a very good friend of hers.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias and Latia came along with their parents in the evening.</p><p><br></p><p>Apparently, Sirzechs and Ajuka hadn’t informed anyone about the events and they only found out about the raid from the news when the Naberius house’s facilities were laid to waste and the bodies of several people were recovered which included the bodies of my parents. They were taken for some autopsy and will be brought back here by tomorrow.</p><p><br></p><p>Serafall had already come and informed me of it.</p><p><br></p><p>Currently the Satans were running damage control and were trying to contain the situation from getting worse.</p><p><br></p><p>They had discovered the hand of the Old Satan faction behind the research and this led to even more investigations and a big scandal being revealed.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, two days later, things came to an end and the bodies were brought back to my territory and a funeral was conducted. It was a relatively small ceremony. I did send the invitations to every Pillar House as suggested by Leila and Venelana but very few of them showed up.</p><p><br></p><p>Actually, only the four Satans and their families along with Euclid and his family showed up. A surprising addition was Lord Belial who apparently knew my grandfather and came to offer his condolences.</p><p><br></p><p>Normally they would have helped our family but knowing their own conditions, my parents had never asked for help.</p><p><br></p><p>Some others sent servants but the others didn’t even do that.</p><p><br></p><p>I am a nobody right now while they are the people who practically rule the Underworld. Why would they care?</p><p><br></p><p>To be honest, would the president of a country care if a small-time farmer of his country sends him an invitation for something?</p><p><br></p><p>My parents were practically outliers and them not coming to the funeral was all but a known fact.</p><p><br></p><p>That said… I remembered everyone but didn’t say anything.</p><p><br></p><p>True bonds are tested in times of hardship.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Three Months Later -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Three months have passed since the day of my parent’s funeral.</p><p><br></p><p>I was in a private room in the Agreas Stadium with my peerage members except Tiamat who was actually present but not in the room with us.</p><p><br></p><p>Several other people had joined us as well. For example, Rias, Latia and their peerages as well as Sairaorg’s new peerage members. Their parents and family members were in other rooms with other Lords.</p><p><br></p><p>Although, Euclid and his family joined us.</p><p><br></p><p>“The sushi in this place is so delicious nyaa~” The soft and content purring of the new additions to Rias’ peerage sounded in my ears.</p><p><br></p><p>I turned my head to see a white haired little girl with cat ears and a tail, eating the sushi in front of her with a blissful expression on her face. She was sitting in the lap of another cat-eared girl with black hair and golden eyes who was caressing her ears.</p><p><br></p><p>The newest addition to Rias’ peerage were Kuroka and Shirone.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka was found in the laboratory raid of the Naberius House and was being experimented on. She was an up and coming figure in the Rating Games due to her talent in Senjutsu. She was interrogated and after a week or so, released. In the meanwhile, Shirone was in Rias’ care. She offered to have both sisters join her peerage when they were cleared of all their charges and they accepted.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka took Rias’ Mutated Bishop because she was already a Bishop and could only be traded for equal or greater value pieces. She originally took both the pieces of her previous King. Now, she was only using a Mutated Bishop Piece.</p><p><br></p><p>Shirone on the other hand became a Rook.</p><p><br></p><p>I guess, me getting Gasper didn’t let her peerage get weakened by a lot.</p><p><br></p><p>Leila was able to save a Kitsune for Latia’s peerage as her Bishop Piece so she earned a lot too.</p><p><br></p><p>I on the other hand got another Peerage member and I wasn’t talking about Natsume.</p><p><br></p><p>My new Rook was an unexpected surprise to me.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t even dream for him to accept to join my peerage but he did and just like that Crom became my new rook.</p><p><br></p><p>We had fought several times after that although not to the same extent.</p><p><br></p><p>I was improving with each fight due to my Gourmet Cells and was able to hold better against Crom. I once jokingly said that he is like a wall and would make an excellent Rook and invited him to join my peerage.</p><p><br></p><p>He accepted.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy roams around the world even now so I don’t know where he is. I didn’t stop him either.</p><p><br></p><p>According to Tia, for now it was better to hide his existence.</p><p><br></p><p>I will reveal him when I come of age.</p><p><br></p><p>As for Euclid, he has been doing regular health check-ups for me since they found me injured in the spar and discovered my Gourmet Cells.</p><p><br></p><p>I explained everything to them and the experiments they conducted resulted in the same results.</p><p><br></p><p>My peerage members had health checkups too to see if they were changed in any way. None of them showed any signs of awakening Gourmet Cells.</p><p><br></p><p>It was decided that the chances that the food I sell matching the ideal food for awakening of the Gourmet Cells of the consumer would be too low and thus nothing changed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Your cells are more active than before. Do you feel any inconvenience while doing your normal job?” Euclid questioned me and I shook my head.</p><p><br></p><p>I consumed several high ranking foods and my Gourmet Cells ranked up to C Rank but that was it.</p><p><br></p><p>The Higher Ranked food was only available after Rank up so increasing my Gourmet Cells was going to be an extremely slow job for now.</p><p><br></p><p>But more on that later.</p><p><br></p><p>Today was something we came here to celebrate.</p><p><br></p><p>The reason we all gathered in this place today was because today was Armin's first Rating Game.</p><p><br></p><p>Armin became eighteen years old today and will be making his Rating Game debut against Vance Amon, the Heir of the Amon Clan.</p><p><br></p><p>The Amon Clan’s House Trait was their Poisonous Fire. It did what the name implied pretty much.</p><p><br></p><p>Vance Amon was an experienced player of Rating Games with an age of over One hundred and fifty years and a pretty decent peerage where all his peerage members were at the very least High Class Devils with two nearing the levels of Ultimate Class. He himself was an Ultimate Class Devil in strength, although not in Rank yet.</p><p><br></p><p>His peerage was among the top 50 players of the Rating Games at 33rd place.</p><p><br></p><p>The fact that Armin was to play against such an experienced player in his debut Rating Game was already making news.</p><p><br></p><p>It was supposedly a random draw so maybe my bestie just had bad luck.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, I doubted the match would be simple.</p><p><br></p><p>After all, in the last three months, Armin stayed at the farm. He told his father that he was going out somewhere secret for some private training with his peerage members and disappeared from the eyes of the common people.</p><p><br></p><p>Only his elder brother knew that he was at my farm.</p><p><br></p><p>All he and his peerage did in these months was eat, train with me until they fell down, rest only to repeat the same thing when they woke up.</p><p><br></p><p>His peerage members, the boys especially, were greatly stimulated when they saw a spar between Armin, Sai and I.</p><p><br></p><p>Well, it was the two of them against me but yeah.</p><p><br></p><p>They put in a lot of effort and I put in the best food I could for them.</p><p><br></p><p>The result was a team which had gone from complete noobs to a somewhat competent one. Tobio could totally wreck a High Class devil or even two if he went all out with his Sacred Gear while the rest could go toe to toe with peak Mid Class Devils, which was a lot considering they knew next to nothing about fighting a few months ago.</p><p><br></p><p>Unfortunately none of them attained Balance Breakers except Tobio who was born with his, he just had trouble controlling it. Last time, I had to step in myself to stop him when he went out of control. </p><p><br></p><p>Then again, those things are actually extremely rare.</p><p><br></p><p>I assume that with a controlled Balance Breaker, Tobio would enter the levels of Ultimate Class easily while the others would be able to contend with Peak High Class Devils.</p><p><br></p><p>“Who do you think will win, Mathias?” Euclid asked me as we looked towards the Rating Game which was now in the planning period.</p><p><br></p><p>“Armin obviously.” I answered without any hesitation.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yup. Big Bro Armin will win this one. No question.” Sai added his two Liliums.</p><p><br></p><p>“Normally I would agree as well but Vance Amon is a very good strategist on top of having a very well balanced team. Many people considered him an idiot when he started the Rating Game when he recruited eight pawns with one piece each but he through hard work alone has turned them into a team who can fight and take down experienced Ultimate Class devils with their teamwork. Not to mention, their strategies which involve the entire peerage. On the contrary, Heir Glasya Labolas’ Peerage, while much better in potential, are still new and have no experience in Rating Games. The only reason Vance is putting off becoming the Head of the House is to first get the rank of an Ultimate Class Devil.” Surprisingly Latia joined in the conversation. I remembered then that the Amons were close to the Astaroths and Latia knew the Heir quite well.</p><p><br></p><p>“What now?” Euclid smiled seeing the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>Latia, Rias and I have been spending more time with each other since my birthday. They were told about the engagement proposal and they both agreed to get to know me better. They have been paying more visits to the farm, especially since the funeral to console me.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias was extremely energetic and cheerful all the time. She, while smart, was easily excitable. It was not annoying though but more like livening up the atmosphere wherever she went. She got along very well with Valerie and they played around in the farm along with Akeno and Shirone.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka joined them too but she had calmed down a lot after the incident and was a bit more reserved. Although, sometimes her mischievous side showed. So she was recovering. She generally spent her time with the other girls.</p><p><br></p><p>Latia on the other hand was like a miniature version of her mother. Sharp like an obsidian blade. She analysed everything with ruthless precision and then broke them down into simpler more efficient parts. Sona might be a genius in strategies but Latia was a different kind of a genius altogether.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, she had her cute moments too. This princess was a classic Tsundere and Kudere mixed and making her blush was one of the things I was learning to enjoy the most nowadays.</p><p><br></p><p>She liked these kinds of debates quite a lot.</p><p><br></p><p>And Euclid, that bastard enjoyed seeing her debate with me. He had this look that annoying elder brothers had when seeing their little sibling with a girlfriend. All that was left was for him to give me a thumbs up. Who knew that the Vice Head of the Devil’s Scientific Research and Development Department was such a stupid romantic.</p><p><br></p><p>Even his wife looked at him with a smile and shook her head.</p><p><br></p><p>My friendship with the mad scientist had bloomed in the last few months and outside of his work, I found him to be a very amusing guy as well.</p><p><br></p><p>He was becoming somewhat of a bro.</p><p><br></p><p>Sai pouted. “Well… Big Bro Armin will still win.”</p><p><br></p><p>“D-don’t get me wrong. I don’t want him to lose. But the chances of his winning are very slim, at least statistically speaking.” She looked at me, slightly flustered. She was probably worried about my thoughts.</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled at her and waved off her worries. “I don’t know much about Vance Amon or his peerage outside of what I have heard from you but I trust Latia’s assessment.”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked relieved but soon her cool and aloof look came over her face again.</p><p><br></p><p>I continued. “That said,” She looked at me challengingly, “I do know of Armin’s ability and this time, I must disagree with Latia’s assessment. She made a mistake not in her analysis but in the information gathering process.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! And what is that?” Euclid smiled at me, clearly enjoying this more than he should.</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled. “Armin is stronger than his opponents. So, he might have a good chance to win this one.”</p><p><br></p><p>I already scanned them and while Vance Amon was strong, he was only a C- Rank while Armin was at C+ Rank. It was two Ranks difference in stats. To put it into an easily understandable perspective, Falbium was at B Rank in his overall combat power. Serafall was the same. But even those two only had C Ranked physiques.</p><p><br></p><p>The current Armin was physically stronger than all four Satans. Not to mention his own Clan Trait would make it nigh impossible for anyone with a weaker attack to breach his defence. I mean, there was a chance that he could get caught or ganged up on but he was used to fighting against me and not to mention, he still had the trump card left.</p><p><br></p><p>Vance Amon might not get an easy win after all.</p><p><br></p><p>\"This assessment of yours is quite contrary to the popular belief of the Underworld, Mathias. The odds are 15 to 1 in favour of Vance Amon in the betting polls.\" Euclid said, looking towards the stadium now.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Just because people choose to believe in something doesn't necessarily make it correct.\" I countered and here I smiled at him. \"And no. The odds are 18 to 1 in favour of Vance Amon. I would know. After all… I did bet a hundred million Liliums on Armin's win today. \"</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>The room went eerily quiet.</p><p><br></p><p>All the people in the room looked at me as if I was crazy… Well except Sairaorg and Shirone.</p><p><br></p><p>Latia was open mouthed at the reveal.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Serafall Leviathan -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Quite a crowd gathered here.” She said as she looked at the stadium from the top floor of the Vip Waiting Rooms.</p><p><br></p><p>“They are making a political agenda of this due to the cleanup we did during the Naberius incident.” Falbium sighed, looking more exhausted than lazy.</p><p><br></p><p>The Pillar Houses were quite shaken due to their attack on the Naberius House. It was only due to the bodies of several Pillar Devils found in the laboratory that they calmed down, aiming their anger towards the now almost isolated house.</p><p><br></p><p>But this didn’t stop them from being wary of the power in the hands of the Satans. They were trying things to show their power and suppressing the influence of the Satans.</p><p><br></p><p>Armin’s debut was affected by this. What was normally supposed to be a fight with a normal High Class Devil changed into a fight with an Ultimate Class Devil who still didn’t have the rank. The loss of a Satan’s brother in their first Rating Game, especially the Asmodeus who was incharge of the defence would then be used as a point to attack the credibility of the Satans. The attacks would be even worse if Armin lost badly.</p><p><br></p><p>Involving children in this mess… <em>sigh</em>. What was the underworld coming to? What was it that they fought for then?</p><p><br></p><p>Her mobile rang and she found a message from Euclid. Reading the message made her giggle, earning a look from her colleagues.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mathias bet a hundred million on Armin’s victory.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs had his mouth slightly open while Ajuka merely raised an eyebrow. She then relayed the second half of the message.</p><p><br></p><p>“Euclid just bet five hundred million after hearing that. He says that it would help his research if he got more funds.”</p><p><br></p><p>This made Sirzechs curious. “What were the odds again?”</p><p><br></p><p>Ajuka looked up. “Eighteen to one in favour of Vance Amon.” He said fiddling with his magic circle. “I bet five hundred million under several other names as well to not draw any attention.” He finished making Sirzechs hold his head in exasperation.</p><p><br></p><p>The research in the Devil’s Scientific Research and Development Department took insane amounts of money which was mainly generated by the sheer number of patents Ajuka and Euclid had. There was obviously funding from the government but it was still not enough for them. Ajuka had several businesses and contracts with top businesses in the human world related to the technology department while Euclid was involved in biological research and medicine. They are always on the look for a chance to earn money for no other purpose than to fund their research.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at the time.</p><p><br></p><p>Eight minutes left till the match started. “Put in three hundred million from me too.” She asked Ajuka.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ahh what the heaven. Put in two hundred million from my side as well, This is my brother’s debut.” Falbium laughed before resting his head on the table for a nap.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs by this time was completely exasperated and finally let out an audible sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>Though three minutes before the match started, he asked for five hundred million to be added too… under different names.</p><p><br></p><p>The match began.</p><p><br></p><p>Vance Amon’s peerage quickly spread throughout the field, taking different strategic positions everywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>On Armin’s side though, none of his peerage members moved and only he walked forward.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is he planning to do?” She raised an eyebrow.</p><p><br></p><p>No one answered her but she soon got her answer when the other side attacked.</p><p><br></p><p>Four of the pawns of the Amon peerage were using magical guns at long range and shot directly towards Armin who was walking directly towards the Amon territory.</p><p><br></p><p>The shots caused explosions around the place and the bishop took this chance to shower the area of impact with several other spells.</p><p><br></p><p>The blasts went on for an entire minute before stopping.</p><p><br></p><p>The bishop looked quite confused and looked towards his King. “Is it over?”</p><p><br></p><p>The King shook his head while looking tensed at the area of impact.</p><p><br></p><p>And out of the flames came the star of the show. A thin layer of Demonic Power protecting his clothes but not even a speck of dust on him.</p><p><br></p><p>The crowd roared in cheers.</p><p><br></p><p>Armin took a look around and headed towards the King of the opponent’s peerage without even paying attention to the rest of the members.</p><p><br></p><p>“Attack.” Vance Amon finally took command and attacked in the earnest.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Armin -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The first word that came to his mind as he saw his opponent’s peerage racing towards him was… slow.</p><p><br></p><p>They were barely crawling compared to the level he had gotten used to in the last three months. He slowly eyed the attackers. Two Rooks, one offensive and one defensive took lead of the charge while the bishop who didn’t attack till now set up a defensive perimeter around their King.</p><p><br></p><p>He did admire the balance of the Amon Heir’s peerage. One bishop of his was completely focused on Defensive magic while the other on Offensive magic while the same was true for the Rook and Knight. Half his Pawns were ranged fighters while the other were close ranged ones who worked in a team to engage an enemy. They were like the four member party of those RPG’s that Mathias sometimes talked about.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, they were effective… or rather would have been if they weren’t so slow.</p><p><br></p><p>Armin kicked the ground and under the shocked gazes of his opponents team, appeared in front of the Defensive Bishop. This one was also an expert in forming Magical Traps and that was something he didn’t want to deal with so… he had to go first. With this thought in mind, he punched.</p><p><br></p><p>The body ricocheted from the ground and Armin saw the lights in his eyes go off but before the sound of his retirement came out, he grabbed him by an arm and used his body to smash the two pawns who had closed on his back.</p><p><br></p><p>Three lights shone in the ground and in a second three of his opponent’s members were out.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>“Vance Amon’s, One Bishop and Two Pawns, retired.”</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p>The Queen and King of the peerage didn’t expect the move at all and completely blanked out for a moment. Just enough for him to kick the Queen in the gut and then knee his face.</p><p><br></p><p>He then threw Queen’s body as a shield against the Amon’s fire as the King hurriedly changed the direction of his attack. The next second the Queen had also retired as his body disappeared from his hands.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>“Vance Amon’s Queen has retired.”</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p>The two rooks had recovered from their shock and quickly covered the King who had surrounded himself with a circle of Poisonous Fire.</p><p><br></p><p>The element of surprise was over. At least he got the other two Ultimate Class beings out of the fight before they could recover from their shock so he counted it as a win.</p><p><br></p><p>“”I didn’t expect you to be this stron….”</p><p><br></p><p>Armin interrupted the speech of the Amon heir as he went on to use his second move.</p><p><br></p><p>He collected his Demonic Power in his arm as several magic Circles lit up around him.</p><p><br></p><p>“SHIELDS!” The opponent King shouted but Armin smirked and instead of punching ahead, he punched the ground below him.</p><p><br></p><p>The ground rose and cracked in several places as if a massive tsunami of earth. The thing which he wanted however was done.</p><p><br></p><p>The entire area was covered by a layer of dust, making visibility nearly close to zero, though Armin was not affected by this.</p><p><br></p><p>He had been learning Senjutsu in his free time and knew the basics of sensing aura. He detected the presence of the enemy king almost immediately… not that he made it any harder by all that fire he was encircling himself with.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, normally, even with his shields, Armin wouldn’t be an idiot to go straight ahead and punch his enemy through the flames but… that was him from two years ago. The current him had been fighting Mathias fucking Buné Zagan. His Dragonflames made this fire look and seem like a candle light.</p><p><br></p><p>Several barriers appeared around his body with a mere thought. His control over his Demonic Power had improved with the use of those Shovels from Hell. He was currently at 4 tons weight while Mathias used 64 tons.</p><p><br></p><p>That monster.</p><p><br></p><p>A lovable and kind monster… but a real monster nonetheless without doubt.</p><p><br></p><p>Armin punched with all his strength, through the famed Poisonous Flames of Amon and the Heir of the Amon, the devil said to be an Ultimate Class in strength, Vance Amon shot out like a bullet, making holes in every building he hit and finally on the barrier of the Rating Game Stadium disappearing in a flash of light as the final announcement of Armin’s win sounded.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>“Vance Amon has retired. The winner of the Rating Game is… Armin Glasya-Labolas.”</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p>As he heard this announcement, a thought passed through his head. ‘How much time did this take?’</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Mathias -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Two minutes and eighteen seconds. It was the shortest match recorded in the Rating Game history. People are calling you ‘The Beast Behind the Glasses’.” Koga laughed as he read the news from his mobile phone.</p><p><br></p><p>“Smashing someone with their peerage member can do that to people.” Kouki smiled while Tobio, while looking shy, also had a smile on his face.</p><p><br></p><p>Armin on the other hand was completely unphased.</p><p><br></p><p>Currently, the guys of our little group were changing clothes to get ready for the party of Armin’s Birthday.</p><p><br></p><p>The Rating Game ended as a surprise for everyone, including the participants.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, even Armin was surprised at how quickly the Game ended.</p><p><br></p><p>Apparently he was not expecting his opponent to be this weak. I don’t think he realises that in terms of physique alone, he was an entire Rank above his opponent while his Magic was on par with his opponent. They were basically smashing their heads on an unbreakable wall… or rather would have if they had had the chance.</p><p><br></p><p>All this time Armin was used to fighting me and Sairaorg who have ridiculous physiques. Sometimes, he even sparred with the dragons in the farm who are known for their physiques so he probably didn’t realise the difference between different types of fighters. And when he did, he was utterly disappointed by the entire Rating Game.</p><p><br></p><p>He was preparing all this time to fight against an Ultimate Class being to prove to his father and teacher that he didn’t need coddling only for the result to be so…</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah. My friend was frustrated.</p><p><br></p><p>But that doesn’t take away our fun in teasing him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Still… two minutes and eighteen seconds. It was too fast.” Sai said as he struggled to put on a tie before Tobio helped him.</p><p><br></p><p>I couldn’t help but say something at this moment. “That’s what she said.”</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>The room burst out in laughter except the speaker who didn’t understand the meaning of the line.</p><p><br></p><p>The shyest one, Tobio, chuckled at it as well while Armin himself had a ghost of a smile on his face after a long time.</p><p><br></p><p>“What? Who said what?” Sai asked, utterly confused.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, your Queen Kuisha said that she liked your black suit better than the green one.” I said picking up the black suit and handing it over to him.</p><p><br></p><p>“But Green is cool. Green is for veggies.” He smiled innocently giving me a solid Guy vibe and I decided that I needed to put a stop to it before I had a weirdo in a green jumpsuit singing Youth in my farm so I pulled him to my side.</p><p><br></p><p>“While green is a good colour for the veggies. We are not veggies, Sai. Wearing Green is a no go. Especially a hat. Yeah, no green hat.” I shut up Kouki, who was going to comment something before he could. “Say that and I will make you wear a Green hat to the party.”</p><p><br></p><p>He became quiet.</p><p><br></p><p>Some explaining later, the guys were ready to face the crowd in what was basically a giant dickwaving party in front of the whole Underworld.</p><p><br><br></p><p></p><p></p><p><br></p><p>This time around I use my Armin shield to prevent idiots from surrounding me. Thankfully, the range of the Armin Shield had expanded after today’s performance and had a passive effect of preventing people from annoying me to avoid annoying him by relation So I was fine.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, I still had company.</p><p><br></p><p>While Armin and his peerage were entertaining the guests who were all eager to lick his boots after the scary performance today, Latia and the rest were still free and I was hanging out with them. Armin’s pawn, his oldest piece, was accompanying us.</p><p><br></p><p>Lisbell Oriax, was the daughter of the younger cousin of the Head of the Branch House of the Oriax and as such had little to no importance in her house.</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully, her mother was a friend of Armin’s mother and she took a liking to her.</p><p><br></p><p>Lisbell was not a good fighter per say. Only at the level of a strong Mid Class Devil, that said she was very great at managing paperwork and management in general.</p><p><br></p><p>From what I came to know, she was being trained to be Armin’s second wife/mistress and help him manage the house in the future or even the first wife depending on a suitable offer appearing.</p><p><br></p><p>They were childhood friends and were actually very compatible with each other.</p><p><br></p><p>Armin often told me about her and from what I found out, she was one of the only people outside his mother and me who supported his painting hobby.</p><p><br></p><p>They were both people of few words though.</p><p><br></p><p>This time Leila was worried that I’d cause some chaos with the gifts so she had already prepared a gift from my side before the event.</p><p><br></p><p>Armin agreed with it as well.</p><p><br></p><p>What was new, unlike the previous parties I had attended, was the dance.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>The last two parties were of twelve year olds while this was the party of a Devil who had just become an adult and bestie was a hot commodity right now.</p><p><br></p><p>Armin’s mother had used Lisbell as a protection against the so-called <em>hussies</em> from taking away her cute son.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, Armin’s mother adored her son A LOT.</p><p><br></p><p>She was just a step short of Serafall in this matter.</p><p><br></p><p>I kinda wonder if that was the reason Armin was so like Sona and also why he always found reasons to not let me meet his mother before this.</p><p><br></p><p>We had the opportunity to meet each other right after the Rating Game and she told me quite a few stories about Armin’s childhood.</p><p><br></p><p>Embarrassing ones too.</p><p><br></p><p>She thanked me for helping Armin all this time, be his friend as well as introduce him to the Peerage members.</p><p><br></p><p>She knew there was something about me but Falbium asked her not to ask and she was the wife of a military family Head as well as the mother of a Satan, she knew the things to ask and not to ask.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, coming back to the dance, I was accompanying Latia whom Leila had left in my care. She knew that I was not one for such formal events and would find an excuse to skip it so she let Latia hang on to me and asked me to accompany her to dance.</p><p><br></p><p>The little princess understood my intentions and we only danced for a while. Leila had hammered the Skills of a noble in me and I didn’t exactly make a fool of myself.</p><p><br></p><p>We excused ourselves after two songs and went back to the side of the hall.</p><p><br></p><p>“How much did you win in today’s bet?” She asked me while we picked something to eat for ourselves.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, something short of a billion and a half Liliums.” I answered. The food was made from some of the lower ranked crops from my farm and the taste was quite something.</p><p><br></p><p>I chuckled looking at her with her cute mouth open in shock.</p><p><br></p><p>I picked up a piece of cherry and popped it in her mouth making her yelp and then bristle as she looked at me in half pout and half anger.</p><p><br></p><p>I laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>She shook her head and looked back at her plate but then I heard her voice.</p><p><br></p><p>“Matty.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Help me train too.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure.”</p><p><br></p><p>No other words were said but I didn’t need any other words either.</p><p><br></p><p>She was very prideful and for her to ask me about this was already a lot. It would be petty of me to force her to say anything more. I accepted.</p><p><br><br></p><p><strong>- Sirzechs -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>While he was not one to use cuss words, the grins on the faces of his colleagues can only be described as ‘shit-eating’. But then again, he was sure that if he looked into the mirror right now, he would find a similar look.</p><p><br></p><p>After all, who didn’t like free money?</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at his account. 9 billion Liliums.</p><p><br></p><p>This was more than what the Gremory House earned in two years.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha I would gladly pay half of this money to look at the faces of those Great King faction members. They must have lost a decent fortune in this game.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A total of fifty two billion.” Ajuka provided the exact numbers making even Sirzechs wince lightly.</p><p><br></p><p><em>That</em> must have hurt… badly.</p><p><br></p><p>The economy of the Underworld was mainly controlled by the Great King faction which is what they used to restrain the Satans mainly. The entire faction controlled a vast amount of wealth and almost every house worth their salt was involved in the Rating Games, making it one of the most prosperous industries in the Underworld.</p><p><br></p><p>This amount was obviously not enough to shake their foundation or anything but enough to make them feel the pain for a while. Just between the six of them, the four Satans, Euclid and Mathias, they had lost almost 38 Billion Liliums.</p><p><br></p><p>“Still, it meant that more than enough people believed in Armin’s abilities.” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Falbium was the one to answer. “Nah. It was my mother and father. Father was actually planning for this from the very start while Mother was actually pissed that Armin’s game was used as a political agenda and put in all her savings to bet on his side. Father was strutting around with his chest puffed like he was the one who won.”</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah.. .Lady Glasya-Labolas doted on her children as much as Serafall doted on Sona. She was just not in a position where common people would know about it.</p><p><br></p><p>“I think I kinda understand why Leila was so worried about Mathias crashing the Underworld’s economy. Even when not intending to do anything, he almost broke the legs of the Great King faction.” Serafall laughed and Sirzechs agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>“And not only Mathias, even Sairaorg won twenty million Liliums while Lord Bael… lost five billion. He didn’t even attend today’s party citing that he was feeling under the weather. Lady Bael attended the party along with her son.” Euclid smirked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Still, I didn’t expect that kind of performance from Armin. I’d dare say that he is physically stronger than us at the present. Do you think he too awakened the…” He looked at Euclid who shook his head.</p><p><br></p><p>“Not really. I checked. None of them except Mathias has awakened those Cells. The chances of awakening those things are extremely small and even that would require high level foods being consumed regularly for years and pushing the body to its limits. Not to mention the issue of compatibility between the food and the consumer. All we have seen is what happens when someone fully utilises the boosts given by those food crops with training to match.”</p><p><br></p><p>“From what I heard, Mathias and Armin sparred all day long, healed up, ate, slept only to repeat the process again in the last three months. Even a normal devil going through such gruelling training would grow at an insane pace. The food only supplemented the growth.” Euclid explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“But what now? With Armin showing this kind of strength, the Great King faction will be even more wary of us. It was a good thing that he didn’t disclose the abilities of his peerage members or things would have been worse.”</p><p><br></p><p>“There have been four marriage proposals from different houses already. Mother used Lisbell as an excuse but the worst part was that even Lord Oriax proposed his own daughter as a candidate. Mother is looking for another girl to possibly shut the mouths of the people. It’s just that such a thing is easier said than done with Armin suddenly being the centre of everyone’s attention.” Falbium explained while looking tired. “He decided that he would go off the radar by saying that he wants to find and train his peerage for a few years, to give us some time. Father agreed as well. He had his fun today so he wasn’t in a mood to shake the boat much.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And he can hide in the Buné territory most of the time.”</p><p><br></p><p>Falbium nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“What about the other children at the farm, Serafall?” He asked. Among them, Serafall knew the best about the farm. With Euclid regularly visiting the place and she herself teaching a few of Mathias’ peerage members, she was the closest person among the four Satans.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. Ingvild is such a cutie. She sings so well that I wish she could sing for my Levia-tan Show. She is also very talented. It’s just that she is kind and doesn’t like hurting others. Lavinia on the other hand is an innocent airhead but she can be downright brutal when fighting. Her abandonment issues are almost dealt with due to the therapy sessions with Leila and she is now associating with everyone very well. The two Damphir children are still young and Mathias doesn’t want them to invest all their time to just train. Leila is teaching them etiquette and manners while Euclid is teaching the girl about her Sacred Gear and how to control it.”</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah… the Sephiroth Graal. Heaven would riot if they found out that one of their relics was born in a Damphir who was now a Devil. The death of their father has really affected the System.</p><p><br></p><p>“What about the new children?”</p><p><br></p><p>“They are starting to acclimate to their new lives. All of them are interested in their new abilities and are training to explore more of their Sacred Gears and Magic.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then let them train. These children are the future of the Underworld. The stronger they are, the better.”</p><p><br></p><p>At this point, all of them completely agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: LuluViBritania(FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>So, a lot of things happened.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Armin finally had the Rating Game debut and got a title.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>We got two kittens visiting the farm and got introduced to some new characters.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The result of the Rating Game was basically this:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The Great King Faction: Who screwed us?

I saw her looking stunned. Ah, she must have heard the conversation.</p><p><br></p><p>The rest of the party went on simply.</p><p><br></p><p>It was when it was the time for them to leave, something happened.</p><p><br></p><p>Ingvild went forward to talk to Sirzechs.</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm, Sir.”</p><p><br></p><p>The guy looked at her with a smile. “Yes, Ingvild. What can I do for you?”</p><p><br></p><p>She took a look at me and I gave her a light nod.</p><p><br></p><p>“My… My name is Ingvild… Ingvild Leviathan.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>To his credit, the guy didn’t become too stunned. “Please explain.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am the granddaughter of the first Leviathan. My father was a human and my mother was the youngest daughter of the first Leviathan.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t have to be afraid. The youngest daughter of Leviathan was Ingrid Leviathan. She didn’t participate in the Civil War and had gone missing when the war started. We were planning to recruit her because she was resistant to the idea of another war, but no one ever found any traces of her in the Underworld.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Y-yes. Mother went to the human world. I-I don’t know what happened to my parents.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Something happened to her? Is she not with you?” At this point everyone was paying attention to her.</p><p><br></p><p>“She passed away. I had fallen to the Sleeping Sickness and only awoke six months ago. Both my parents had passed away. I was taken care of and hidden by some of the Leviathan House’s, my mother’s attendants.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You woke up from the Sleeping Sickness!” Euclid asked, stunned.</p><p><br></p><p>“I… awakened my Sacred Gear when I was asleep. It caused me to wake up.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sacred Gear… Half-Devil… oh.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Tiamat brought you here?”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you tell anyone about yourself?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I didn’t…”</p><p><br></p><p>“She did.” I interrupted her before she could complete her sentence.</p><p><br></p><p>This girl… She was lying to not get me in trouble.</p><p><br></p><p>Her eyes widened as she looked at me and I couldn’t help but shake my head. “Why are you surprised? I let you stay here, took you into my peerage… do you think I would be embarrassed or afraid about these facts?” I looked at Sirzechs and explained, “She was uncomfortable about sharing her lineage because it would have caused a lot of problems and I wanted to give her time to open up on her own terms.”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded. “The Civil War was a… difficult period for all of us. Many people who didn’t want to fight were dragged onto sides, forced to choose sides. Even now, even among the remaining thirty four pillars, there are people who don’t trust us. There is nothing we can do about it rather than let them open up in due time. Maybe if not them, then their children, the younger generations. Your distrust of us is, while disheartening, understandable. Do you mind if we had a talk with you?”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at me and then back at him and nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>They took her to have a private talk for an hour or so and then left.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why now?” I asked, considering she was afraid to even meet them in the morning and now she took such a big step.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are getting engaged to their little sister and niece. If I had revealed it later on, it would have caused trouble for you.”</p><p><br></p><p>I let out a sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>“It would have caused nothing. You shouldn’t worry too much, you know.”</p><p><br></p><p>This girl is too soft-hearted.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is Lavinia alright?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm,” I nodded. “She is just resting.”</p><p><br></p><p>I went ahead and hugged the girl. She froze for a moment and then returned the hug.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>It was hard to remember that she was just sixteen before she fell asleep.</p><p><br></p><p>________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>Lavinia came to me the next morning.</p><p><br></p><p>“I… I want to join your peerage.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked up at her from my book. “Is this about what happened yesterday? If so, then you don’t have to force yourself. Just take your time.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It is not just for what happened yesterday. I like this place. Everyone here treats me nicely and I feel like I can trust them. Gasper and Sai are like little brothers to me, Ingvild and Valerie like sisters. Tiamat is like a strict guardian. I want to be together with them and I want to be together with you and help you too.” She spoke and it was probably the first time she was this serious</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at her. “Sit.” She did and I continued. “No one is telling you to leave anywhere. You are just as much a part of this place as any of us. I am fine with you joining my peerage. I did invite you. But… I want you to think this over for at least a week. Sometimes when people go through a life and death situation like you did, it can have some effect on their thought process. I want you to think this thing through and not do it in a moment of impulse, only to regret later on. If by the end of the week, you still want to join my peerage, I will welcome you with open arms. Do you understand this?”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked like she wanted to protest but then stopped herself when I added. “Please. Just do this for me.”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Also, choose a dragon for yourself. I have told the dryads to increase the dosage of the fertilisers for your hunting companions. You need to get them to a good enough level. I want you to increase their training first and also make some additions. I know you are attached to them and so am I. So, we just need to take a middle ground. Instead of changing your team, we will just make them stronger. I have also asked for some books on Ice Magic and teleportation magic for  all of you to escape in case you encounter situations like yesterdays. Don’t be stubborn and stay back to fight. Just like you treat the people here as your family, they do the same. And losing a family member sucks… sucks really bad.”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at me for a while and then nodded. “Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Sirzechs -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“What were the results of the tests?” He asked Euclid.</p><p><br></p><p>None of them had slept for the last two days.</p><p><br></p><p>The things that had been revealed would have caused the entire underworld to be overturned and might have even started another war depending on how it was revealed.</p><p><br></p><p>They just had no room to make any mistakes.</p><p><br></p><p>“None of his produce can be grown. The cells just refuse to be replicated or grow. To be honest, I don’t even know how they are different from normal beans. Any detailed magic test we did on them turned out to give normal results. Even the non magical tests did the same.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ajuka?”</p><p><br></p><p>“They cannot be grown by anything I could think of. Not even replicated.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So they are safe for sale, right?” Serafall asked. She was probably the most excited about this.</p><p><br></p><p>If the Sitri could get a contract with Mathias, their Medical Business will boom like never before. In fact, anyone who could get a contract with Mathias could take over the Medical Business.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Although their export will need to be regulated heavily. These things are far more dangerous than Phenex tears.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Agreed. What did you find from the Leviathan girl?” Sirzechs asked. Serafall had been the one doing the questioning.</p><p><br></p><p>A Leviathan descendent.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, wasn’t that a surprise?</p><p><br></p><p>“She… was clean. Everything checked out as well. Some of the Leviathan supporters were hiding her. They were actually hiding her from both the Old Satan Faction and us. The girl had been comatose for over a hundred years. She is still mentally only sixteen years old. I… used some hypnosis on her caretakers. We just couldn’t risk the Old Satan Faction implanting someone near Mathias, especially with what we had seen. I found out that she didn’t have any connection with the Old Satan faction. They didn’t even know she existed. Did you guys get something from Tiamat?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Tiamat confirmed that she picked her up after knowing her identity. She thought that Ingvild would be a great addition to Mathias’ peerage because of her Sacred Gear, Nereid Kyrie. It controls seas and can empower dragons too. The girl is untrained but strong. Apparently, she is already a Satan Class despite being asleep for a hundred years… without her Sacred Gear. What do you think of the girl?” Ajuka replied. He had talked to Tiamat over a communication link and confirmed this.</p><p><br></p><p>“I think… she might have a crush on the little hunk. She apparently decided to open up because she heard that he was talking about engagement with your families and wanted to avoid any problems for him. I even offered her to become a High Class Devil, get her own peerage. Getting a Leviathan descendant to support us would be a massive win. They still have people who support them even now. Many of the older ones too. She could help us attract many of them.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What did she say?” He asked, understanding her point of view.</p><p><br></p><p>“She rejected. She wanted to stay in the farm and wanted to have no part in the politics of the Underworld. She actually wanted to become a singer before she fell asleep. She had been going through serious mental trauma because of the loss of her family and the children at the farm have filled up that hole for her. She thinks of that place as a new home. One thing was good that she agreed to learn water magic from me. I can learn more about her from our lessons. The boy lucked out with her. Getting a peerage member like her will surely get him much needed backup.” Serafall said, relaxing back on her couch again.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. About that. Apparently, she is not the only one.” He replied scratching his cheeks.</p><p><br></p><p>“What!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Bewoulf, would you please explain to everyone what you saw?”</p><p><br></p><p>And he did. The reactions were just as he had expected.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mathers checked the bodies of the Ultimate Class Demonic beasts that Mathias had slain. In the whole battle, I don’t think I should call it that as it lasted less than twenty seconds, he had killed three Ultimate Class demonic beasts, bare-handed, without using any kind of magic or other energies, using just pure physical strength. He wasn’t even in his dragonified form. I asked Surtr, who possesses the most physical strength in my peerage, if he could do it and he couldn’t. Not without magic. The horn that Mathias had just broken off casually, could stand two full-powered attacks from Souji and that’s saying something. His physique must at least be comparable to that of Dragon Kings to do something like that.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“It should have been obvious to begin with. Armin trains with him for a year, eats the special farm crops and he becomes Ultimate Class in terms of physique in a year. Mathias has been eating those things for as long as they have been produced, it was obvious he would have far stronger growth.” Falbium commented.</p><p><br></p><p>“What we all might be missing is that the boy is also an apparent genius in Magic. It is not very evident with his obsession for his farm but those wards around his farm… those things were comparable to the wards I have put around Lucifer’s Castles and our offices. If he did all those by himself, self-learned, he might be a master wardcrafter as well.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Mathers?” He asked the only person who had any idea about this.</p><p><br></p><p>“I… don’t know much about this. From what Mathias told me, he only wanted to learn the magic to guard the area near his farm. I did agree because it seemed reasonable. Moreover, all I taught him were just the basics. I did give him access to my library as I was instructed.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm, Boss. We are getting off topic.” Beowulf interrupted and he remembered the original topic.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, continue Beowulf.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The girl he went to protect back then, she… she had a Longinus. The Absolute Demise.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So… the Balance Breaker was of… the Absolute Demise?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“How does Tiamat even know about these things?” Serafall asked, amazed. He had been too when he had found the things Tiamat was sharing.</p><p><br></p><p>“We often forget that she is someone who is older than our entire Race. She knows many things that we don’t. For example, did you know that Leviathan was not of a Demonic Beast heritage? She was the daughter of the King of Atlantis. He had tried to control Great Red and Great Red destroyed Atlantis, leaving only Leviathan alive. She hid in the Underworld, in the pits for centuries in fear and that’s how her Magic Power turned into Demonic Power. The Father of the Angel’s snooped in and took the soul of her father and made a Sacred Gear out of it… Nereid Kyrie. What Ingvild is carrying right now, is the soul of her great-grandfather, who was someone comparable to Indra in terms of strength. Would explain how she could break out of the Sleeping Sickness.”</p><p><br></p><p>He smiled internally looking at the dazed looks of others. He had been shocked the same way and thus it was good to see others in his shoes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Those old coots would flip out if this was ever revealed.” Serafall suddenly broke the silence with a laugh.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. They would just reject the story.” Euclid said and he had to agree too.</p><p><br></p><p>“But still, Tiamat is a treasure trove of information. Seeing as she could get so many Sacred Gear user’s information.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, Mathias also told Armin about some names. Five people, all might have top class or Longinus Class Sacred Gears. Armin already contacted them and is trying to recruit them in his peerage. Apparently, he wanted to help Armin out when he found out that he didn’t have enough Peerage Members for his Debut Rating Game.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Five?!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Five.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Falbium, you do understand that if we get some many Sacred Gears suddenly, people will think we are preparing for war?” Serafall asked, looking a bit serious.</p><p><br></p><p>“Doesn’t make any sense rejecting them.” Falbium countered and he knew that it didn’t.</p><p><br></p><p>No other faction would just let them go if they were discovered. Either they would be recruited or… Removed. It just didn’t make sense to let them go.</p><p><br></p><p>“And he just <em>told</em> Armin all of this?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Those two are very close. You saw that Adamantine Dragon. I don’t even have an armour made of Adamantine and I am a Satan. Also, that brat, Armin wants to convince a few of them to join Mathias’ peerage at least. Sometimes I wonder if Armin is my brother or his.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, Rias and Latia would have a good partner at least. What do you think, Sirzechs?” He heard Serafall asking him and sighed.</p><p><br></p><p>“On one hand I am annoyed that my cute Ria-tan is crushing on a brat and on the other hand, hoping with all my heart that this relationship is successful. Mathias is the best match I could find for Rias. Smart, humble, strong, no make that very strong, and someone who takes great care of those close to him. Devils with all these qualities can be counted on one hand.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hey, have you looked at the guy? Those muscles? If I had been a hundred years younger, I would be crushing on him too.” Serafall laughed and he rolled his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, why is no one talking about the sudden appearance of four Ultimate Class Demonic beasts in the area? Ultimate Class beasts are not that easily born. Even if they are born, they will never travel together easily. These four from what you have told me, were fighting together against an opponent. <em>That</em> can’t be a coincidence. First, Lady and Lord Bune disappear in the Pits and now this. Something is going on.” Ajuka pointed out and he paused.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Demonic Beasts of that power never travelled in groups.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will send my peerage members to investigate.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will accompany them too. I needed to go and collect more plants for research either way. I could check and see if there are any changes in the pits too.” Euclid said and he agreed.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>– Leila Astaroth –</strong></p><p><br></p><p>\"So, how did the talks go?\" She heard her husband ask.</p><p><br></p><p>\"As much as I had expected. Mathias asked for the girls to be informed and their consent to be considered. A period of two years to get to know each other so that they don't face any problem later on. Quite smart if you ask me.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Well… he's got a good teacher. Still, I didn't think your plan would succeed.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"What plan?\" She asked casually,  already knowing the answer.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Oh please. Don't think I didn't notice you throwing subtle signs of pairing Latia with Mathias towards Lady Gremory to get her interested and interrogate Sirzechs. Poor guy was still thinking that it was his fault that his mother got interested in this matter.\" He scoffed and she couldn't help but smile.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I didn't plan in such detail… or rather, I had just started implementing the plan before the entire fiasco with the misplaced fruit happened. It helped push things a lot earlier.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I thought so. Still, I don't understand why?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Sirzechs and Ajuka were planning to leave one of Mathias' houses open for proposals when his identity was revealed so that the Great King faction might not clamour later on. A good political move, especially considering the thing they were hiding but not something I can accept. I can't let my daughter and student get into a marriage that is a constant political drama meant for other people's entertainment.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing her husband's look of realisation, she continued.</p><p><br></p><p>\"It meant that both of Mathias's houses could only have girls who were not political puppets of any faction. I considered all girls near their age but Rias was the one who came out on top based on both her personality and her background. You don't understand it do you?\"</p><p><br></p><p>He shook his head and she sighed. She loved her husband. He was a phenomenal businessman but politics was something he wasn't interested in.</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes it seemed that she was the only outlier in the family. But then again, her daughter was turning out pretty good. She looked at her husband and continued.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I considered Seekvaira and Sona Sitri before Rias but they both have a much more serious personality and a rather controlling nature and…\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Trying to control Mathias is plain stupidity.\" He completed and she nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>\"They also don’t have any replacement heirs. Moreover, it’s a bit of a secret but I have heard that Sona Sitri is planning to build a Rating Game School for Low and Mid Class Devils. Such a move will definitely earn her the ire of the old traditionalist side and while Mathias could help her, it will also bring him in the line of fire, much more than he already will be. They were out.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Reasonable enough. Also, Serafall.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Yes.\" She smiled. \"Also Serafall. I, then, considered Armin's younger cousin but she is just nine at the moment and wouldn't even be twelve before Mathias is of age. I couldn't know her personality. The daughter of the Phenex was out because they did have some political agendas too.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I did hear something about that matter too.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Ultimately, Rias is the best candidate I could think of. Her connection to the Bael through her mother and Sirzechs, would provide a layer of protection for Mathias. She was not politically inclined either. Our families are very close and thus any chances of conflict is reduced greatly. Moreover Rias' outgoing and slightly impulsive personality is perfectly balanced by Mathias' easy going, laid back personality and Latia's serious and cautious one. No one will be able to question her as Lady Buné or Lady Zagan either and they get a peaceful married life.\"</p><p><br></p><p>… </p><p><br></p><p>… </p><p><br></p><p>“You know what Dear, you are a terrifying matchmaker.”</p><p><br></p><p>”Don’t you mean terrific?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I know my grammar, Dear. It’s scary how much though you have put into this. And…. I find it attractive too.” He added quickly and she rolled her eyes. “Still, I didn’t expect to see all <em>that</em> on his farm.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t think anyone did. Adamantium! He had freaking <em>Adamantium </em>spawning Dragons.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I know right. I didn’t even know of his ranch before today.”</p><p><br></p><p>“None of us did except maybe Armin and Sairaorg.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Lord Gremory was probably planning to make contracts for his Textile and Clothing ranges. I will have to make a contract for the Winery I am planning to open.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Before that, we need to go and negotiate which house Latia will be taking the name of if they get married.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That… yes. But don’t you think we are hurrying too much on this?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s better to get these things out of the way.”</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, what do you think of the Leviathan girl? It seemed to me as if she had somewhat of a crush on Mathias.”</p><p><br></p><p>“She does. The girl’s clean. I was with Serafall during her questioning and even talked to her on my own. If she gets together with him, all good. At best, she will be given the title of the Head of Leviathan but even that is extremely difficult seeing her half-human heritage. Might even try to get her into their own houses to integrate the Leviathan Bloodline with their own. Not that it will happen, knowing Mathias. He wouldn’t let something like that happen. You saw his reaction when she denied telling him about herself.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I think he would have done that for anyone.”</p><p><br></p><p>“He would. We know that. She doesn’t. Put yourself in her shoes and it’s a classic situation for a crush to develop.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What does Latia and Rias themselves have to say about this?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Latia agreed. She was actually happy about the two years period and her consent being asked. As for Rias, they will talk to her and we will find out soon.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I hope all this ends well.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Me too.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Mathias -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>A week later, I was called to New Lilith by Sirzechs.</p><p><br></p><p>Armin was in the Human World, getting to know his targeted peerage members better.</p><p><br></p><p>Sai was going on as if nothing happened.</p><p><br></p><p>Lavinia is now my second Bishop. She was standing by her decision and I didn’t have any reason to deny her.</p><p><br></p><p>Euclid was coming by every few days to take some of my plants to conduct research and see if they were safe. He also helped me a lot.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy was a mad genius. He accepted that if not for his wife and daughter, there was a good chance that he might have ended up insane during the Civil War.</p><p><br></p><p>He saw that Lavinia was learning Ice Magic and didn’t have any teacher and offered his help. The Lucifuge house specialises in Ice Magic and Ingvild was already being taught by Serafall about Water Magic. In fact, in his free time, he taught me several types of Magic too.</p><p><br></p><p>The four Satans and their peerage members were now buying food from my farm full time.</p><p><br></p><p>________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I entered the room guided by Okita Souji and surprisingly saw all four Satans sitting in one room, a very serious look on their faces. They noticed my arrival and Sirzechs nodded at Souji who nodded and left the room, closing the door behind me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Take a seat, Mathias.” Sirzechs was the one who opened the silence and I could feel the looks on the faces of the other guys. Serafall’s look had a look of pity. Ajuka was unusually quiet and so was Falbium.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is everything alright?” I asked, a little worried.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s… it’s about your parents.”</p><p><br></p><p>I stilled.</p><p><br></p><p>My parents?</p><p><br></p><p>The word was so familiar but still so unfamiliar.</p><p><br></p><p>The thing is, I don’t know if I was transmigrated or reincarnated and later gained my memory of my previous life. I do have all the memories of the previous Mathias and I know how much his parents had taken care of him. Even if I consider that I was transmigrated and just took over the previous Mathias’ body, I would still owe a debt to his parents.</p><p><br></p><p>The two people whom I can only remember from my memories and yet I carry their names, am their successor, their heir. The things I have now are mostly from them. The feelings I have for them… are complicated.</p><p><br></p><p>“We were a little suspicious about four Ultimate Class Demonic beasts appearing at the same time and decided to check the areas near the pits to assure if the things were alright. They weren’t.” He said but I could feel his uneasiness.</p><p><br></p><p>Is he worried about checking the things in my territory?</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t even go near the pits because there was no need to do so.</p><p><br></p><p>“You were just doing your job. Please don’t worry about it.”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded and continued. “We found out that the number of Demonic Beasts had increased much more than we had thought, although as you had said, the areas near your farm, sixty miles around it, were all clear.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I haven’t explored further from my farm but I will soon clear those areas too. I am just waiting for my Dragons to grow up a little more before cleaning the territories and establishing a solid perimeter around the pits.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t need to be in a hurry. There is no rush for it. I will send my peerage members to clean the area. It is just that, we checked the pits and found some… disturbing things inside. Some… Devils were making the area into a research facility and experimenting on the Demonic Beasts to control them as well as strengthen them along with several other experiments.”</p><p><br></p><p>A Research facility in the pits? Which insane idiot would do such a thing? Just as I was about to ask, something struck me and I paused completely and my eyes widened.</p><p><br></p><p>“You said, it had something to do with my parents.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Your parents and their peerage members were killed by the people incharge of the place.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“So, they were not killed by the Demonic Beasts?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs hesitated a little and it was Ajuka who spoke this time. “No. We discovered some documents which suggested that they might have been experimented on before their deaths.”</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t know the feeling I was experiencing right now. There was a feeling of loss but not something overwhelming. I guess, they had always been dead for me and I was just used to it. Still… I felt sad and angry but at the same time, very calm.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you know the identity of the Devils who did it?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Curson Naberius. There were some other devils, including his son, Cadmus Naberius, but he was the head of the place. We have taken him into custody but he hasn’t said anything yet. We have also managed to get the custody of their peerage members and are questioning them. We were waiting for you to respond before proceeding to question the Naberius House and get answers.”</p><p><br></p><p>Naberius.</p><p><br></p><p>“Their bodies?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The bodies of my parents and their peerage members, do you know where they are?” I asked. The least I could do was give them a proper funeral.</p><p><br></p><p>“We are still questioning the prisoners. We will inform you as soon as we find out.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Can I meet them? The prisoners.” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>They looked at each other before nodding.</p><p><br></p><p>Before leaving the room, Sirzechs apologised to me. “I’m sorry, Mathias.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It was not your fault. You couldn’t have known. The Underworld is a big place and blaming you for someone else’s mistake just to feel better would be incredibly petty. In a way, I am to blame for it too. If I had reported it earlier, there was a chance that they could have been saved. But, there is no use crying over spilt milk. This is just one of those things we have to learn to live with. Please, just see that whoever was responsible for this… gets what they deserve.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will make sure none of them escape justice.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>I was led to the dungeons. I could see several cells filled with different criminals.</p><p><br></p><p>We finally reached our destination with a man inside a cell, sealed with many different restrictions.</p><p><br></p><p>“He is Curson Naberius. The one in the cell beside him is his son, Cadmus Naberius.” Souji told me and then hesitated a little before adding. “Master Mathias, I know you must be angry at this moment but please don’t let that anger overwhelm you. He is an Ultimate Class Devil and can take a lot of torture so he might not answer your questions that quickly”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you, Mr. Souji. I know that I cannot kill them. If I did so, we cannot identify their accomplices and many others behind these experiments will get away only to start the experiments in a different place, causing even more lives just like my parents and their peerage members. I am not so selfish to allow that to happen. I just want to know about the bodies of my parents and their peerage members. I will leave after that.” I explained and he nodded to me.</p><p><br></p><p>I entered the room and the guy looked up at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Heh. Sending children now? Those four are as gutless as ever. What do you want to do, brat? Beg me to tell you everything?”</p><p><br></p><p>“My name is Mathias Bune.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha aren’t you that peasant noble? What does the beggar Bune want from me? Looking for donations?” He laughed and I could see his anger and spite.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am just here to ask you about my parents.” I continued.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Okita Souji -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Souji watched tensely as the young boy looked at the convict with that eerily calm expression. He knew about the situation the boy was in and that just made this calm and polite attitude all the more terrifying.</p><p><br></p><p>Souji had seen such an expression before. And he knew from experience that people who can keep this kind of expression are dangerous.</p><p><br></p><p>Now that he thought about it, both the previous times were also redheads.</p><p><br></p><p>One being his king, Sirzechs Lucifer, the strongest Devil himself.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs Lucifer, despite what was thought of him, was a natural pacifist. He never resorted to violence unless it was the last choice and even then, in his entire lifetime serving Sirzechs, Souji had never seen him display any outward shows of aggression. Not even in the most dangerous of fights.</p><p><br></p><p>The other had been the swordsman whose blade he had almost fallen to when he was still a human. Red hair, a cross-shaped scar on his cheek, and the same polite attitude. From what he knew of him, in his later years, the infamous Manslayer had also become a pacifist. He had even rejected the offer of Satan Leviathan to become her Knight.</p><p><br></p><p>Such restraint and control required an insane mental strength and confidence in one self. Such people were bound to make their names in history… just like Sirzechs Lucifer and his old rival, Kenshin Himura.</p><p><br></p><p>And now Souji was watching the same level of restraint from a child who became sixteen a week ago. This matched with what he had heard of the boy’s strength, a week ago from Bewoulf, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying at the same time.</p><p><br></p><p>“Your parents? Yes yes, I remember them… they squealed so hard when they were experimented on. Good test subjects, though. Your mother, that bitch, if her face hadn’t been mauled by the demonic beasts, she would have made for good entertainment for the boys. Satans know her peerage members were quite a treat hahahaha.”</p><p><br></p><p>Souji clenched his hands at the language. The boy….</p><p><br></p><p>“Where are my parent’s bodies?”</p><p><br></p><p>Souji was probably as taken aback at the evenness of the boy’s tone as the criminal himself. They both took a few moments to recover their calm.</p><p><br></p><p>“You want to know where their bodies are?”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Come here, I’ll tell you.”</p><p><br></p><p>Souji tensed but the boy went ahead anyway.</p><p><br></p><p>The criminal however just spit on his face instead of answering and began to laugh again. “Hahahaha I fed them to the dogs. You bastards took away all my research. I was so close to achieving my dreams and now you all walk all over it. As if I would ever give any of you traitors the satisfaction while I die trapped in here. You will  never get anything out of me. If I die, you will suffer too.”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy made some water on his palms with magic and washed his face without the slightest change in expression.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. So, you are doing this not out of any reason but out of spite. Hmm, understandable. Getting everything taken away from you and left with nothing, you must be feeling desperate and hateful. It’s understandable. But you are misunderstanding something.”</p><p><br></p><p>The Naberius devil looked at him with a confused look and he continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“You seem to think as if death is a punishment. Believe me… it’s not. When we are dead, it’s all over… Well if you are not reincarnated by some Random Omnipotent Being as their entertainment maybe, but hey, isekai is a rare genre nowadays, so no, death is not something you should be afraid of. Trust me, I know. There is nothing after death.. Life… on the other hand… is much more unforgiving. In fact, just for this very reason, I am going to request the Satans… to let you live.”</p><p><br></p><p>The criminal’s face turned into a scowl at the words. “You think false promises of life would make me open up, foolish child…” His growl was stopped by the boy’s words.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, no. I don’t. I don’t expect it to. I know it won’t do any good, so let’s stop making assumptions, shall we.” The boy paused and then looked at Souji and spoke again, “Mr. Souji, him screaming won’t be a problem, right? Or should I put some wards around us?”</p><p><br></p><p>Souji just shook his head, too confused to say anything.</p><p><br></p><p>In a matter of seconds, the entire place was riddled with wards. Souji noticed that the wards had made the walls between the cells transparent so the man could see his son captured in the adjacent cell.</p><p><br></p><p>With everything done, the boy sat in front of the man. “Do you know how life punishes people, Mr. Naberius?”</p><p><br></p><p>The devil who was suddenly quiet after the display of magic from the so-called kid and looked at the boy in apprehension.</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t like killing people, Mr. Naberius. I respect life. I am not afraid of death but… I fear life. Life gives us everything that we know of, friends, family, love, achievements, pleasure and sorrow… everything. It makes us what we are. And to punish someone, it just… takes these things away.” The boy touched the man’s forehead and the man’s pupil’s dilated.</p><p><br></p><p>“Your sight is taken away so that you cannot see this beautiful world. Your smell is taken away so that you cannot ever enjoy the smell of flowers ever again, your taste is taken away so that you cannot ever taste good food ever again, your sense of touch is taken away so that you can feel neither pain nor pleasure… well, at least physically. And, finally before taking away your sense of hearing, I would like to tell you how to end this. Well, very simple, the only way to end this is to answer my question. For this, I will leave your ability to speak intact. And unless you do so, feel what it feels like to be rejected by all life… To be truly alone. Feel what an eleven years old child had to feel when you took away his parents and friends for your own selfishness.”</p><p><br></p><p>With the last words said, the man fell to the ground senseless and the boy just sat there quietly in front of him.</p><p><br></p><p>Two seconds later, screams began to echo in the dungeons.</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>Souji watched in awe and horror as an Ultimate Class Devil was broken in under three minutes.</p><p><br></p><p>He answered all of the boy’s questions after his senses were returned  but the boy only got up and entered the adjacent cell and questioned the son.</p><p><br></p><p>It was at that moment that Souji realised that the wards had been projecting only the image of his son in the cell. All this time. The son hadn’t heard only the shouts but none of the answers.</p><p><br></p><p>His answers verified, the boy left the cell and returned to the father’s cell.</p><p><br></p><p>“I promised you that I will request the Satans to let you live, didn’t I? I will do so. After all… the dead don’t suffer. Every time you close your eyes, you will feel the same thing I made you feel today. The moment you get used to that feeling, your memories regarding it will be erased and you return to square one. The only way you can get a proper sleep is if you answer all the questions asked by the people here peacefully and truthfully. Curson Naberius, I sentence you… to life.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man’s face turned to that of horror as the boy simply ignored everything and came out of the cell.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you for your help, Mr. Souji. I think that invading the Naberius territory would be a big problem so I will leave the task of retrieving the bodies to you all.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Y-yes. We will get your parent’s bodies back.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you again.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Mathias -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I was feeling very… I don’t know, angry, frustrated at whatever had happened.</p><p><br></p><p>I knew that they might not even be related to me but I still felt bad. I didn’t want to go back to my home because my peerage members would be worried without any reason and thus, I am here.</p><p><br></p><p>I was heading towards Tia’s place. Maybe talk to her or take a nap there and refresh my mind.</p><p><br></p><p>On reaching the place, I was greeted by a very strange scene.</p><p><br></p><p>Tia was standing across from a cloaked guy, looking serious. No aura was being released by either of them but I could tell that the guy was strong.</p><p><br></p><p>My arrival was noticed by the both of them as they turned towards me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mathias.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.” I looked at the huy and used Observe and got the answer to my question.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>[Crom Cruach, Rank: A-]</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Your friend?” I asked Tia and she shook her head.</p><p><br></p><p>“An acquaintance.” She then turned towards the guy. “Why do you want to fight me?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do we dragons need a reason to fight and test our strength?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No, we don’t but someone like you who hasn’t been seen in ages suddenly coming out cannot be without a reason.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I came across some information that you have crossed the threshold of the Dragon Kings as well. I just want to test where I stand against you because the other two in the same position are not interested.”</p><p><br></p><p>So, he was here for a fight.</p><p><br></p><p>I was a bit miffed.</p><p><br></p><p>I came here to rest in peace and maybe talk to Tia for a while and this guy…. Right then an idea struck me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you here for a fight?” I asked the guy who had till this moment ignored me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Is that a problem for you?” The guy replied, uncaringly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Problem… well, I am kinda the owner of this area and if you guys fight here then my farm will be destroyed so yes, it will be a problem. On the other hand, I have a special area warded off for fights just like this. It could probably hold the fight in. But, that’s not the main problem anyways. What I wanted to ask was… can I fight you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Mathias.” Tia looked at me in confusion.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tia….I am a little angry, a little confused and extremely frustrated. I just want to vent and break things for once. Just let me do this.”</p><p><br></p><p>Her mouth opened lightly as she looked like she was about to say something but stopped and nodded and I looked back at the guy in front of us.</p><p><br></p><p>“Come on. I promise it won’t be boring. I am not as strong as you but I assure you that I will not let it be a disappointment for you. When you win, I will even heal you up so that you can fight Tia all patched up.”</p><p><br></p><p>The guy, even for an Evil Dragon, looked genuinely taken aback and then looked at Tia as if asking if I was right in the head.</p><p><br></p><p>“He is not lying and he <em>is</em> the owner of this area.”<br><br></p><p>The guy looked at us for a moment before nodding and I led him towards the place I had made for the dragons to duke it out when they had any arguments among themselves.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Venelana Gremory -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Sit Rias.” She asked her daughter who looked confused by the sudden call.</p><p><br></p><p>She took her seat and looked quietly at her.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are now sixteen years old, now officially a part of the Devil Society.”</p><p><br></p><p>Her daughter nodded and she continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s time we talked about the future. You are the Heiress of the Gremory family. Your actions will represent the house. You understand this, right?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Mother.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We have been delaying this for a while but now that you have made your public appearance, there have been several marriage proposals for your hand. We have to reply to them sooner or later.” She saw the look on her daughter’s face.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias was always free-willed and stubborn. She got it from both her father and her.</p><p><br></p><p>“There are some who proposed us while some others which we ourselves are considering from our sides. The main ones are the third son of the Phenex House, Riser Phenex. Lord Phenex has been pushing for this for a long time and the Phenex are a well established house. The union between the two houses is something that would benefit everyone.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That jerk! I don’t like him. He is so arrogant, always blabbering about how great the Phenex House is and how no one else can match him. He is very annoying. I don’t want to marry that jerk.”</p><p><br></p><p>“He is still a child and will grow in time.” Zeoticus tried to speak up but it was of no use.</p><p><br></p><p>“And what if he doesn’t grow up? You said there were others too. Why can’t it be someone else?”</p><p><br></p><p>“There are very few Pure Blooded devils as of right now. There are not many suitable Pure Blooded devils around your age. The others would be Zephyrdos Glasya-Labolas.” She saw her daughter make a face and laughed internally and also agreed with her opinion of the younger Glasya-Labolas child. He was too different from his cousin. Not to mention, his….unique style.</p><p><br></p><p>“There is also Sai but he is your cousin and there would be too much politics involved to even think about it. Apart from these, there are really no other young devils I can think of on the top of my head.” Zeoticus added and she agreed as well.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at her daughter’s frustrated looking face. She already knew what her daughter wanted but teasing her was the fun part. It seemed that she was getting sad for real now so she decided to drop a hint.</p><p><br></p><p>“I mean, it’s not that there are no other ways but I don’t think you would agree to those.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What other ways?”</p><p><br></p><p>“There are other candidates but they are either Heirs or Lords of their own houses or too old. If you marry a Heir of another house, you might have to marry into that house. You won’t be the Lady Gremory in that case but the Lady of that particular House and in that case, your Heirship will be transferred over to Millicas. Would you give up on your Heirship, Rias?”</p><p><br></p><p>She saw her daughter snap her neck up in her direction.</p><p><br></p><p>“Who else?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! Are you considering giving up your Heirship?”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at her daughter with a glint in her eyes and chuckled internally. “Depends.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, the choices are Diodora Astaroth.”</p><p><br></p><p>And the glint turned into a frown. The Astaroth Heir hadn’t been in her good books since her birthday while someone else was.</p><p><br></p><p>“Others are Gerret Amy, Soran Amon, Divalo Oriax, Armin Glasya-Labolas. Did I miss someone dear?” Zeoticus said and he looked at her, barely holding his smile at Rias’ frustrated looks.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, I don’t remember anyone but in my opinion Armin should be a wonderful gentleman. Their family is great as well and no one will be able to say anything..”</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, not being able to take it, her daughter spoke for herself. “What about Mathias?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Mathias? Hmm….well yes, he could be a good choice but there is a catch Rias. I think you already know about the situation of Mathias’ identity.” She saw her daughter nodding. Both she and Sirzechs had explained to Rias in no simple terms that she needed to keep whatever she saw at the farm a secret to herself only.</p><p><br></p><p>“What catch?”</p><p><br></p><p>“You see, Leila is already planning to engage Latia with Mathias. They have known each other for a long time and are quite compatible. Latia is not the Heiress of the Astaroth family either and can easily marry off to the Bune House. It’s basically a done deal.”</p><p><br></p><p>“B-but….I met him….first….” Her barely audible voice was something that was captured in the voice recorder under the armrest of the chair. A good material to tease her later on.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. And although there <em>is</em> an option of marrying into his other House, you would have to share your legal wife position with Latia. Would you do that though?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I can?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, it can be done.” Zeoticus said, with his hand under his chin.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will then.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh! You will?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure about this, Rias?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias nodded, looking very serious.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at her husband and then slumped back into the couch, lightly closing her eyes. “Very good then. It’s a good thing I already talked to Mathias about this.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“What!”</p><p><br></p><p>Zeoticus burst into laughter and she joined in as well.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias seemed to have realised that she was being pranked and blushed crimson.</p><p><br></p><p>“Now, here’s the thing, Rias. Mathias and I talked about this topic and he asked me if you agreed with it. He said he values your friendship and won’t agree if you don’t agree. He wants you two to get to know each other better so that you don’t have any regrets later on which might have a bad effect on your friendship. ”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at her open mouthed look and smiled. In this regard, she was already happy with Mathias. If someone cares so much about her daughter just as a friend, he would definitely keep her happy when they get married.</p><p><br></p><p>“Due to Mathias’ situation, we cannot sign an official marriage contract right now. It will be signed in two years when he takes over the Lordships of his Houses. So, in the next two years, get to know each other better. Is that alright with you?”</p><p><br></p><p>Rias nodded, still slightly stunned.</p><p><br></p><p>“Another thing. Do not reveal this to anyone. We are to keep this matter a secret unless his identity is revealed or it would cause problems for everyone.”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded again.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good then. Have a good night then. Oh, and you should go and meet Latia too. She is in the same position as you and it will be better if you two got along better.”</p><p><br></p><p>Rias left the room quickly, too shy to stay any longer but not before giving each of them a hug.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, that went quite well.” Zeoticus relaxed. “Still, was that necessary?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Telling her that you were engaging her to someone and thus she cannot be an heir anymore directly could have made her think badly of this. A simple change in the way of putting things can make a lot of difference.” She explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“Bah, with the crush she has on the boy, she would rather think badly of me if I engaged her to someone else because of the heirship. Still, Mathias….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Is most likely like Sirzechs. Did you see the Demonic Beast corpses that Bewoulf had brought back? Two of those could have put me in a desperate situation and he supposedly ended the entire fight in less than twenty seconds….bare-handedly. How is someone like that an Ultimate Class level being?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I did. The leather from the beasts are priced at millions of Liliums according to our appraisers. To think such beasts were….are fed to dogs and used as fertilisers….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Why would he need those when he has Adamantium producing dragons. Also, you probably didn’t feel it but those Dryads who were escorting us….were all strong. I felt the energy of one when it stopped a plant from attacking us. Even lightly speaking, she would still be at the very least as strong as me. If the others were as strong as her, then the entire place had over a dozen Ultimate Class beings. It is comparable to the power we have backing our house, <em>with</em> the support of Sirzechs. Not to mention that Leviathan girl.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A Leviathan….who would have thought. I for one never thought that we could ever get one to cooperate with us again, especially since the last war.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A good thing. I just hope that everything goes well till things are finalised.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Me too. I talked to my mother about this. She….she said that in case people found out about it and anyone tried to interfere….she will awaken the ancestor.”</p><p><br></p><p>Even Venelana was taken aback at this. “Her?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. She said it would be worth it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“….and she might be right.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Euclid -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Did you find out what Mathias did to him?” Serafall asked him as soon as he entered the room.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, I did. I also understood why the Heaven’s decided to attack the Zagan first. If he had remained alive, there was a high chance that we would have won the war.” He said remembering the thing he had just seen.</p><p><br></p><p>“What are you talking about, Euclid? What was it?”</p><p><br></p><p>“A virus. It was a virus that infected his brain, rather more specifically, the part of the brain that controls the senses. Curson Naberius loses all his five senses as soon as he closes his eyes.”</p><p><br></p><p>He saw the look of realisation in Ajuka’s eyes while the other three were a bit confused so he explained the details.</p><p><br></p><p>“Imagine not being able to use any of your senses every time you close your eyes. We need a certain period of time for our brain to relax and close our senses one by one when we sleep and even then our sense of hearing is still awake. What the virus does is skip the part where the brain relaxes and the consciousness fades, directly making the person feel like they have been thrown in a dark place where they cannot use any of their senses just like being suspended in space with nothing around but darkness. The viruses stop working every time he answers a question for a certain period and starts again. So the only way he can stop going back to that hell of nothingness is if he answers our questions. Thankfully, the virus doesn’t spread. I understand what he meant by ‘sentencing him to life.’ Compared to a life like this, death would be much better.”</p><p><br></p><p>He watched the rest take in what had happened before Serafall spoke again. “The guy had it coming. To be honest, the boy handled it far better than any of us….well except maybe Ajuka, could have. I would have killed them as soon as I got the names of his accomplices. Leaving them be, takes a lot of courage. So, did you find the information we were looking for?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. They have several other labs but the main one is in the Naberius territory. It was watched over by his son. Coincidentally, the son was visiting the father when we raided the lab and was caught. The bodies of Lord and Lady Bune are also in the same lab, preserved for their genes. They were experimenting on different types of beasts and races to create Super Devils. I am pretty sure that they were connected to some of the older devils or the Old Satan faction. We need to raid the other lab soon or they might clean things away.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do it. I will lead the raid personally. Euclid, accompany my peerage and retrieve every test subject. If they are innocent, let them go, if not, question them and we will execute them. These people have kidnapped a Head of House, said Head’s wife and peerage members of both, experimented on them and killed them. This <em>is</em> treason. Was the Head of the Naberius house aware of this?” Sirzechs asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“He was but he turned a blind eye to their deeds as long as they didn’t get in trouble.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Then I will pay a visit to him personally. These people need to be reminded why we sit in these seats.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sir, what do we do with Curson Naberius?”</p><p><br></p><p>“What of him? Wasn’t he sentenced to life? Let him live.”</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x__________________________________________________________________x________________________________</p><p><strong>Beta Reader: LuluViBritania(FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Authors Note:</strong></p><p><strong>First things first, Mathias will not be becoming a raging avenger of any sorts.

They were told who was going to come there and visit the farm and thus to remain on their best behaviour.</p><p><br></p><p>“But we are always well behaved.” Valerie pouted.</p><p><br></p><p>“Replacing the Rainbow Fruit with the ‘Vanilove Fruit’ was not correct behaviour.” I replied back.</p><p><br></p><p>“B-but you told us that we could arrange the gift as we wanted and Leafa had eaten the Rainbow Fruit. Also the Vanilove Fruit looked so much cuter. Say something Gaspie.” She prodded the boy beside her who had finally gained enough courage to stand outside without fainting now.</p><p><br></p><p>The reason for this was Tiamat. She trained the boy herself to get over his crippling social anxiety. She was planning to make him like a proper dragon, just without dragon’s blood. The touching thing was that, despite what would be considered borderline abuse by many others, Gasper enjoyed Tiamat’s attention. For the boy who had never known a mother, Tia had become Tiamama.</p><p><br></p><p>I had once said this and it had made the boy blush like a bright red apple while the dragoness had just scoffed at the idea but was still smiling.</p><p><br></p><p>It had given the boy a lot of confidence and he was growing out of his anxiety issues. Although, he still wore girl’s clothes… which even Tia found adorable.</p><p><br></p><p>“U-umm,” Ingvild called out to me. She had revealed her heritage to me at a later date and I reassured her that I won’t let anything happen to her. She was probably scared at the guests arriving, especially knowing their identities. Anyone would be nervous, let alone someone like her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry. The ones coming here won’t do anything. You are in my peerage. Also, you are free to hide your identity if you want. It is your choice. I will back you up, no matter what you choose.” I patted her head and she nodded shyly.</p><p><br></p><p>It has been two weeks since the party and I had finally gotten some points in another harvest to get my stats to the level. It took me six months to get my stats to the peak and now I just had to collect points for the next Upgrade.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Host: Mathias Buné</strong></p><p><strong>Title: The Poor Noble, Pure Blooded Devil, The Farmer</strong></p><p><strong>Age: 16 years old. </strong></p><p><strong>Body: B+</strong></p><p><strong>Mind: B+</strong></p><p><strong>Spirit: B+</strong></p><p><strong>Magic: B+</strong></p><p><strong>Luck: B+</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Skills:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Buné Clan Trait:</strong></p><p><strong>Dragon Taming: B+</strong></p><p><strong>Dragonification: B+</strong></p><p><strong>Dragonfire: B+</strong></p><p><strong>Dragon's Aura: B+</strong></p><p><strong>Dream Manipulation: B+</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Zagan Clan Trait:</strong></p><p><strong>Life Magic: B+</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Magic:</strong></p><p><strong>Teleportation: C+</strong></p><p><strong>Bounded Field Creation: B+</strong></p><p><strong>Memory Alteration: C+</strong></p><p><strong>Barrier Magic: B+</strong></p><p><strong>Spatial Magic: B+</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Martial Arts: B+</strong></p><p><strong>Touki: B+</strong></p><p><strong>Cooking: B+</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Abnormality Resistance: B+</strong></p><p><br><br></p><p><strong>Farm Management</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Farm Rank: B</strong></p><p><strong>Farming Points: 72,128.</strong></p><p><strong>Money: 44,488,000Ⱡ</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Shop</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Inventory</strong></p><p><br></p><p>It has been six months since I upgraded to the B Ranked Farm.</p><p><br></p><p>This time, I merely focused on my existing skills and a new Skill, Cooking.</p><p><br></p><p>Most of the things I get from the Toriko World on my farm, need to be cooked by ridiculously proficient cooks to get the best results from them. This made me take the Cooking Skill.</p><p><br></p><p>Also, none of the people on my farm know cooking. It was fine when I was alone but with several others, I decided to take on cooking myself to avoid disasters.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean, I even had the thought of letting Lavinia inside the kitchen. Valerie and Gasper are too young and Ingvild has just started learning cooking. Oh, and I laughed at the thought of Tia cooking.</p><p><br></p><p>I noticed the change on my Status Panel.</p><p><br></p><p>16 years old. It has been over four years since I was sent to this world. I looked around me, the vast stretches of land covered in different types of plants, as far as eyes could see.</p><p><br></p><p>The product of all four years of my work was in this place.</p><p><br></p><p>Leila knew of my birthday and decided that today was going to be the day they visited so that everyone could celebrate my birthday with me on the farm.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Where is Lavinia, by the way?\" I asked, not seeing the blonde airhead anywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>\"She went out for a bit and will be returning by afternoon.\" Ingvild thought for a moment and replied.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Alright.\" I nodded and went out to check on Sai. He had been waiting for the others outside.</p><p><br></p><p>I reached outside the gates and found Sai standing and several magic circles appeared at that very instant and out came all the guests.</p><p><br></p><p>The four Satans. Leila, her husband Septus, Latia. Armin was accompanying his brother. Euclid and Sirzechs' peerage members joined the party too. He himself was here with his entire family.</p><p><br></p><p>Today was the first tour of my farm lands.</p><p><br></p><p>The chorus of Happy Birthdays filled my ears as the guests entered inside my farm area.</p><p><br></p><p>\"This place is beautiful. I remember flying over this area once during the wars and once later on and it looked drastically different from how it looks now. If I didn't know better, I would have believed that I had teleported to the wrong location entirely. Did you do this all by yourself?\" Zeoticus Gremory asked me after taking a look at the place.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I was helped by others.\" I replied humbly.</p><p><br></p><p>\"The work of your creations is also considered your own.\" Sirzechs smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>\"The barriers around the place are quite well made. I find it hard to notice some areas and even when I do, I cannot penetrate the insides of the barrier to see what is on the inside of the farm. If I am not wrong, whatever we are seeing is not all of it?\" Ajuka asked and I observed a small magic circle in his hands.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I put the barriers to hide the place. In case someone teleported here accidentally, all our efforts would be wasted. The more <em>special</em> areas are inside. Let's have some breakfast first, then we can take a tour of the farm.\" I called them in to sit in my garden.</p><p><br></p><p>\"You did all this by yourself?\" Euclid asked, making some magic circles and observing.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hmm, yes. I learned Bounded Field Creation and Spatial Magic especially for this. Mr. Mathers helped me out with it. The books in his library were quite inspirational too.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I only helped you with the basics. That said, even I didn't realise that there were barriers around us. This is truly a magnificent warding system.\" Mathers jumped around inspecting the wards.</p><p><br></p><p>Sai led everyone to the breakfast table while I called for my peerage members and followed.</p><p><br></p><p>Preparing the entire thing took a long time and I started to wonder if I could get someone who can cook in my peerage.</p><p><br></p><p>My peerage members arrived soon enough. </p><p><br></p><p>Leila looked at me and I introduced them all. \"These are my peerage members. Gasper and Ingvild, my pawns and Valerie, my bishop. There is another person who I want to recruit as a bishop but she is currently out to hunt for demonic beasts around the area.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Ingvild was understandably nervous, while the other two fidgeted. On second thought, Gasper looked like he was ready to dash away from the place at a moment's notice.</p><p><br></p><p>Serafall was the one who spoke with a smile. \"So, who was the one who packed the gift?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Ah, that was Valerie. She thought that the Vanilove Fruit looked <em>cuter</em>.\" I replied, looking at the blushing Valerie. <br><br>\"I am sorry for the misunderstanding.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Oh, no harm done child. I can assure you that it looked cute. Just like you or even cuter. In fact, it looked so cute that my Rias developed a massive crush on Mathias due to it.\" Venalana laughed while I and a few others suddenly looked at Rias who was currently sporting a nuclear blush. To be honest it was adorable to see the usually outspoken girl blushing like this.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Mother!\" She protested.</p><p><br></p><p>The surprise happened when Rias went to Gasper with a squeal to hug him to hide her own embarrassment.</p><p><br></p><p>Everything stopped.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Wait! Gasper doesn't mean anything.\" I shouted before anyone could make a move. \"It's fine Gasper. No one will hurt you.\" I hugged the boy and patted his back to calm him down. No one interfered. </p><p><br></p><p>The time went back to normal.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Are you fine now?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Sorryyyyy.\" He muttered softly.</p><p><br></p><p>\"It's fine, you were surprised. Happens with the best of us.\"</p><p><br></p><p>After calming the boy down, I looked at the group who looked for an explanation while Rias looked around in confusion.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Gasper is not used to the presence of other people and sometimes loses control when agitated.\" I explained.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Did something happen just now? How did Gasper get there?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"If I am not wrong, this is the Forbidden Balor's View?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"It is. Gasper's immense magical power makes it so that the Sacred Gear is in Balance Breaker at all times. It can stop time within a certain area and he activates it unconsciously when excited or scared.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"He?!\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Ah, yes. Gasper is a boy.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Then… why the girl's dress?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"B-because it's cute.\" He whispered out shyly.</p><p><br></p><p>\"It is.\" Two people nodded at this. Unsurprisingly, Serafall and surprisingly, Venelana, who even added, \"I think I have some photos of Sirzechs' childhood like this.\"</p><p><br></p><p>… </p><p><br></p><p>… </p><p><br></p><p>\"You could seal it until Gasper grows older.\" Euclid suggested.</p><p><br></p><p>\"It's fine. I can control it if it ever goes out of control. I think it is good for him to get used to his powers by himself instead of avoiding it. Although learning about sealing might be of help if I ever encounter something later on.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah, sealing is an OP hax skill no matter the world. The God of the Bible was probably an Uzumaki in hiding. Blonde and with a sealing fetish, going around sealing everything.</p><p><br></p><p>The dishes were served as we sat down.</p><p><br></p><p>It was mainly the food from the Toriko world.</p><p><br></p><p>\"These are Surprise Apples topped with Sherbet Apples. Surprise Apples get tastier the more they are surprised. The drinks are Blue Hawaiiyokan and Soda Watermelons. Oh, the strawberries are called Cuticle Berries and help in hair growth as well as keeps the hair shiny and healthy.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"The Surprise Apples are different from the last time.\" Rias said as she ate one.</p><p><br></p><p>\"This time, I had Tiamat scare them. The taste can be extremely different depending on how much you scare them. Actually, we play this game a lot. Measuring how much one can surprise it. These little things can surpass the taste of even the best fruits currently grown on the farm, although it would require a tremendous danger to get that level of surprise. On the scale of one to one hundred, the ones you are eating now are eighty nine and it took Tiamat scaring it with all her power out.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I wonder how that works?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Are these cotton candies?\" This time it was Latia asking.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Those are called Cotton Candalones. They grow like that on trees.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"So, you are saying that your farm has cotton candies growing from trees?\" Serafall Leviathan asked with a weird glint in her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>\"There are even cakes, rice dishes and sodas. I am not allowed to drink but I think there is even alcohol growing on the trees.\" Sai, who took a break to breathe, spoke before going into eating again.</p><p><br></p><p>“It sounds like that children’s story I had read. I think it was called ‘Charlie and the Chocolate Factory’.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, have you read it? I liked the story a lot and modelled several of the areas based on it.” I really did so. It was one of my favourite stories from my childhood and the idea of creating a farm like that was quite interesting to me.</p><p><br></p><p>We talked around about several things while eating and finally it was time for the tour.</p><p><br></p><p>“My farm is divided into several areas. Some of them are experimental and still being constructed. The areas are divided into zones depending on what kind of crops are grown there and what function they serve.” I led them into the first bounded field with endless fields of grains. “This zone is mainly for grains. The Sun Wheat and Moon Rice being the most common. There are obviously higher types of crops. For simplicity’s sake, I have marked all my products with Ranks from F , E, D, C and higher and each Rank is further subdivided into three sub ranks like F-, F and F+, with F- being the lowest and the quality increases, the higher we go. The fields contain grains up to C+ Rank, although they are the lowest amounts as they are the hardest to grow.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do each of them have different effects?” Euclid asked, taking a look at the crops.</p><p><br></p><p>“Some effects overlap and are stronger in the higher ranked products.”</p><p><br></p><p>We flew over the lands to the next bounded field but there was something in between them.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is that tree?” The shock in whoever asked the question was easy to notice.</p><p><br></p><p>This was the favourite place of Ingvild because of… well what it was.</p><p><br></p><p>The eight hundred metres giant waterfalls, falling from the nine hundred metres giant Water Tree which had a radius of one thousand metres itself. The sound of water around the area drowned every other sound in the immediate vicinity completely.</p><p><br></p><p>This was my B+ Ranked Water Tree, a tree that can provide water to an entire country.</p><p><br></p><p>There was fog in the vicinity and the scene looked amazing.</p><p><br></p><p>Ingvild has a cottage in the middle of the tree where a fruit grows every twelve years which increases the water affinity of anyone eating it by insane amounts almost instantly.</p><p><br></p><p>This appeared only after the Tree reached its highest level which was the B+ Rank along with several other convenient features too.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is the water source of my entire farm. The tree is called the Water Tree. All the water for my entire farm as well as territory comes from this tree.”</p><p><br></p><p>The crowd watched in speechless wonder at the thing that rivalled several miracles of the world and would have been declared a World Heritage Site if there had been any such thing in the Underworld. The sheer beauty of such a thing was beyond words. Standing in front of the tree made one realise how small they were in front of the world.</p><p><br></p><p>\"The water is absolutely pure. Not a single germ will be found in the water from this tree. It also has a purifying effect on blood and improves health. This is much better than any bottled water in the human world you can find.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"And you use that water for your fields?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Obviously. My plants are incredibly sensitive. Some plants cannot even stand a five degree change in temperature when growing. The requirements increase as the value and strength of the effects increase. This water is both physically and magically neutral and thus suitable for all the crops. There are some technicalities of my power but taking care of these plants is not as easy as it looks. I have eight hundred and eighty dryads who take care of my crops and it requires immense amounts of demonic breasts to help the dryads grow to suitable levels. These dryads have nature magic and are able to take delicate care of each individual plant.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"That's rough. It will get easier if you hire some help later.\" Septus suggested.</p><p><br></p><p>\"He would, if he got over his fear of maids.\" Leila teased, making me blush while Latia giggled.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Why would you be afraid of maids? We have a lot of maids in our house and they are not scary.\" Rias asked and I looked at Sirzechs for help. Somehow, the topic would ruin everyone's mood if I said it out loud.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Mathias has a bad experience with a monster in a maid costume.\" Sirzechs protected… Or tried to protect and I wished he hadn't.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl had a blank look on her face and he added. \"It was a very scary monster.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully, we reached a different area and all of a sudden, the change in the scene caused her to forget what she was thinking.</p><p><br></p><p>The fruit area was in front of us but unlike the other areas, this one looked more like the descriptions of Alice in Wonderland.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is the Fruit Area. It contains almost all the fruits that I grow on the farm. Some of the trees can be dangerous if approached without caution while some are downright killer. Some fruits might look as if they are ripe but would need a lot of time to ripen. Some fruits need to be prepared in a special method to be edible but they more or less have the most beneficial effect. If you want to know if any fruit you want is ripe or not you can call any dryads in the Farm. Rose, Lily, Daisy, Violet, Lavender, Iris, Poppy, Marigold.” I called for the Dryads who are incharge of the fruit garden and in a whirlwind of leaves and flower petals, the eight appeared. The eight of them were the strongest among the dryads of this area, each at the peak of the Ultimate Class at C+ Rank, and can more or less control any plant that goes wild. They obviously have over a hundred others under them too.</p><p><br></p><p>“These eight are in-charge of this part of the farm. They will guide you through the area.\"</p><p><br></p><p>In the meantime, I guided Serafall and Euclid to choose food for Sona's birthday.</p><p><br></p><p>The destination was the Rainbow Fruits.</p><p><br></p><p>\"So, you were planning on giving this to Rias? These things are huge.\" Euclid asked me. </p><p><br></p><p>\"They are so cute. All colourful and shiny.\" The magical girl Satan almost squealed.</p><p><br></p><p>\"The size depends on how old the fruit is. There are ones of normal size too. You can try one if you want. The ones in this area are ripe enough.\" I pointed them towards the fruits.</p><p><br></p><p>\"What effects do these have?\" He asked while trying to pluck one of the fruits and failing.</p><p><br></p><p>\"They can take around a metric ton of force before they can be plucked for the really big ones. This one can take around 500 kilograms of force. These fruits increase the overall cell activity. In short, anyone eating this fruit would gain around eight times more results from their training for a few months to a year depending on the size of the fruit. The training results will increase for both physical and magical power.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"And this is the rate for every level of strength?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Only for Ultimate Class. The Grading System I use corresponds to different ranks. C- to C+ is the Ultimate Class. The information I told you is for Ultimate Class beings. Low Class Devils will have their health greatly improved but they won't be able to digest the effects properly. They will lose most of the nutritional value of the fruit. But then again, the effects will be more pronounced in lower strength levels so… who knows? My Peerage Members have eaten these and are doing well so I am sure they don't have any I'll effects.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"So… what's the catch? I don't believe that things like these can just be grown so easily.\" Serafall asked.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Obviously they cannot be grown easily. It took me around three years to get this one done. Moreover, the amount of fertilisers and care it needs is ridiculous. I had to keep a dozen of my dryads in this area to take care of these plants specifically. To give you an idea, with the amount of resources it takes to grow one of these, I could produce 80 metric tons of Moon Rice and that's just a rough estimate from me.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next hour I suggested some things, which Serafall bought instantly.</p><p><br></p><p>The rest of the group had also gathered back and we proceeded to the next part.</p><p><br></p><p>On the way, our group was halted by Ajuka who noticed a group of my creations being carried somewhere.</p><p><br></p><p>\"What are they doing?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Those are my hunting squads. The Buné lands are near Pit Number 8 and is responsible for keeping it in check. My hunter squads hunt down the demonic beasts that come out of the pits near the area after which the meat and blood is used for food and fertiliser. This squad just got injured in their fight so they are being carried to get treated in the medical area.\"</p><p><br></p><p>… </p><p><br></p><p>\"But didn't you create them?\" Euclid asked, confused.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I did. So what?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Ah… What I mean is can't you create more to replace them?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I do create more to keep the Pit in check. That said, these animals have lives. It doesn't mean anything if I created them. They are alive, they have emotions and can feel pain, so they deserve every chance to get treated and live. Also, can't you see how cute they are. My Tri-Hounds are adorable and extremely efficient in their work.\"</p><p><br></p><p>… </p><p><br></p><p>He looked away a little awkwardly, scratching his cheeks while some others just shook their heads.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I am sorry if my words seemed rude to you Mr. Euclid but, these animals have accompanied me for a long time in these lands and protected me. They hold an emotional significance to me too. I just can't see them die if I can help it. After all, as you said, I did give them life. In a way I am like their parent although the comparison doesn't exactly match, you can understand my meaning, right.\"</p><p><br></p><p>He had a look of understanding on his face and then shook his head. \"No, I was out of line here. I didn't realise their importance to you before speaking.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"You probably didn't realise how strong they are. Each of those Tri-Hounds are at High Class Level. For a squad like that to get injured, they must have encountered an Ultimate Class Demonic Beast at the very least. Losing such an able squad would also be quite an unfortunate loss for anyone.\" Ajuka broke the awkward situation by his statement, making all of the people look back at the cute hounds again.</p><p><br></p><p>\"There are Ultimate Class Demonic Beasts in the area?\" Serafall asked, looking surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Nowhere near the farms. Around sixty kilometres radius surrounding the farm has been cleared. These squads were hunting closer to the pits.\"</p><p><br></p><p><strong>– Serafall Leviathan –</strong></p><p><br></p><p>\"Why would you need to hunt beasts for food? Don't you have enough?\" She asked, confused. With the amount he produced, he wouldn't have any shortage of food.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Oh, that's for the farm animals, hunting squads and even as fertiliser. The squads hunt for everyone and it doubles up as clearing the area for later too. I mean, later on people would probably start living in this territory again, so I need to reclaim the lost area from the demonic beasts for them.\"</p><p><br></p><p>… Ultimate Class Demonic Beasts were things that even she rarely got to eat. The best food items available to the Underworld and now… It's being fed to dogs and used as fertiliser and farm yard manure.</p><p><br></p><p>If she didn't know better, she would have thought that the boy was trying to kill her through emotional damage.</p><p><br></p><p>\"What is this medical area you are talking about? Can we take a look at that before we go further?\" She diverted the topic. Medicine was an area her family excelled in. If there was something good, she could clue her parents too. Sirzechs as expected was browbeaten by Venelana. She actually had a bet with both Leila and Euclid that he would blurt out the secret sooner or later and… they won.</p><p><br></p><p>At the very least, she can win something for her family.</p><p><br></p><p>\"It's the place where all my hunting squads are treated when they are injured.\"</p><p><br></p><p>He led the group to the barrier on the other side than the one they were initially heading through.</p><p><br></p><p>What greeted them when they entered the barrier was a long stretch of houses carved in trees… No, the trees themselves turned and twisted in ways to make the houses.</p><p><br></p><p>In each of the cabins, there was a large flower. The area itself was surrounded by flowers and was peaceful.</p><p><br></p><p>\"The flowers. They have a hypnotic effect. If I’m not wrong, it calms the animals down.\" Euclid pointed out and only then she realised the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>\"It is. These flowers are called Peaceful Flowers. They normally don't grow in such places but I changed that by using some specially made fertilisers. There are some animals on my farm called the Nikoniko Manatee. They are the most pacifist creatures in the world. In their mating season, they release a certain pheromone which calms down even the most dangerous and violent of beasts, a dragon in outrage for an example. The pheromones can be used in perfumes or even fertilisers to grow these flowers which have the same effects. I use it here so that the animals can calm down and get treated properly.\"</p><p><br></p><p>A Dragon in outrage… But then again, who would be more knowledgeable about dragons than a Buné? The perfume though. She could think of a dozen uses for it on the top of her head.</p><p><br></p><p>A thought for later time.</p><p><br></p><p>She watched as one of the Tri-Hounds, which had its leg severed, was treated by a Dryad. She took the cut off limb and placed it on the severed part, cleaning the wound, arranging the bones and then she was passed another long strip of leaf which she wrapped around the leg. The Tri-Hound shook lightly while she caressed its head and in around a minute or so, it got up.</p><p><br></p><p>… the limb was completely attached.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Those are? What was that leaf?\" She asked, barely keeping her voice from shaking to hide her excitement.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Those are called Doctor Aloe. The leaves of this plant are a natural bandage. They can cure burns, scrapes, frostbites and other affiliations. They can also attach severed limbs as long as the two parts are not completely destroyed and they are connected back together within a few hours time.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Does it work on every living organism? Any side effects?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"It can be used on every organism I have tried it on. In fact, the greatest user of these plants is Sai, who often gets injured during training. No side effects found either. These are C+ Ranked Plants and are a bit hard to grow though.\"</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at others for their reactions and every adult was barely keeping their shock in control while Armin, Sairaorg and his peerage members were looking at it as if it was nothing special, just an everyday occurance.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked again as the Tri-Hound was then placed in what looked like a giant Tulip. Its petals closed around the Tri-Hound and a few minutes later, the Dryad brought the creature out. All its injuries were gone and it was healthy. Finally, the Dryad popped a red coloured berry into its mouth and the Tri-Hound regained its colour back instantly.</p><p><br></p><p>\"The giant flower is called a Therapy Tulip. It, to explain it in simple words, <em>eats</em> the injuries of others. The downside to using it is that if anyone faints inside it or an uninjured being is thrown inside, it will gobble them up. One requires a lot of training to use them properly. This however is bypassed by the Dryads who can control plants to a certain extent. The last one was the Blood Berries. They replenish the blood of a living organism. The type of blood is automatically changed to suit the user. It's also a delicacy for Vampires or at least Dhampirs.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"What does it mean to 'eat' the injuries? How can something even eat such things?\" Euclid asked, flabbergasted… or rather was the first one to voice out their collective thoughts.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I don't know. I made it through several cross-breedings and mutations. At this point, I don't even know why it does what it does. I mean, just because Lilith and Lucifer created the Seventy Two Pillars, doesn't mean that they know all the specifics of their power. Life is a powerful thing. Its power lies in its ability to adjust and evolve to become more than it was before. At this point I have just learned to accept this simple fact, having witnessed it several times for myself already.\"</p><p><br></p><p>… </p><p><br></p><p>Somehow she or anyone else didn't have any answer to his example. It was a bit weird to hear such words from a sixteen year old but then again knowing who his teacher is, made sense.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, it still didn't change the facts that these three plants were revolutionary. Each one of these can be used to start a business on its own. People can be trained to use Therapy Tulips and the Doctor Aloe would sell anywhere regardless of the price.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Is there anything else apart from these things?\" Euclid asked, and she could see him wanting to research everything the very instant but holding himself back.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hmm, there are some animals. There are some animals like Medicine Bees, which store medicines in their bodies. They can sting and inject medicine into the bodies of the patients. They also make a Royal Jelly which is an extremely potent medicine too. There is the Coloured Rice which can neutralise almost any type of poison. Finally, there are the newest ones, the Senzu Beans, but they are too hard to grow. They are B Ranked products and are basically the same as Phenex Tears, although only one can be eaten every ten days because they fill the stomach for ten days and eating more can make the person bloated.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Phenex Tears!\" More than one person shouted at this.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Yes. They can heal and restore the person to full health and strength instantly.\"</p><p><br></p><p>“Phenex Tears cannot restore the lost energy of a person. Can these… Senzu Beans do it?” Sirzechs asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm they can’t? I was quite sure they could. Eh, whatever. My Senzu Beans can do it. Although, mental fatigue might remain.”</p><p><br></p><p>\"How many can you make? How fast? Can someone else make them too? Will someone else be able to grow them if they get their hands on the seeds?\" She asked quickly. Phenex tears are one of the most important exports of the devil race and a very important tool of negotiation. It is so important that even the Satans bear the Phenex House's pride sometimes due to them being the only source of this healing item. Each of these tears cost millions and that brings a lot of revenue.</p><p><br></p><p>But that was not all. These things could restore all the energy and even help to recover from fatigue. The Phenex tears couldn't do such a thing. This meant that top fighters like the Satans could fight almost indefinitely unless faced against overwhelming enemies. It will certainly increase their power by a whole lot.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I have just started planting a few months ago. Only one batch has come out. The production will increase in the future. No. I can say with full confidence that no one in this world will be able to copy them. You can try copying any of my products and see for yourself.\"</p><p><br></p><p>That she will have to. They just couldn't afford to have their enemies copy things like these.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>– Mathias –</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I was showered with questions about the Medical Area by all the people, one after another. I mean, sure I understand their concern about our enemies finding a way to grow these but… these products cannot be grown without the system or rather without me, even if I give them the seeds for it. It was my absolute Trump Card after all.</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm, aren't Senzu Beans from the Dragon-Ball Anime?\" Rias asked, raising her hands.</p><p><br></p><p>My smile widened at this point. \"Why yes. Yes they are. Where do you think I got the inspiration for it? My Senzu Beans are exactly like the ones in the anime.</p><p><br></p><p>“Really?!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Really.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Soooo Cool!”</p><p><br></p><p>We decided to leave things for later because we were not alone on this tour.</p><p><br></p><p>The next area was something that needed some measures to be taken before entering.</p><p><br></p><p>Armin and Sairaorg were already used to this area so they didn’t even blink an eye but Armin did make a barrier for everyone. It did raise some eyebrows.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s so that the ones inside are not spooked or we don’t get hit if they are in the middle of a game.” He explained.</p><p><br></p><p>The next area was the place where I kept my animals, my Ranch.</p><p><br></p><p>Fortunately, the fear was unneeded.</p><p><br></p><p>My Ranch was under several layers of Barriers and wards unlike the other facilities which only had one layer. It was because the animals inside the place, while not generally aggressive, could get rowdy at times.</p><p><br></p><p>Taking precautions is better.</p><p><br></p><p>I put a lot of time in my Ranch. Especially with the Dryads keeping the farm mostly attended, I have got a lot of time on my hands.</p><p><br></p><p>The Ranch doesn’t need me to prepare soil for the animals. A few of the animals do need some specific environments but the biomes are divided in a way that they can accommodate such animals easily.</p><p><br></p><p>This part of the farm covered a huge area, much larger than my farm’s plantation areas. The area around us was covered with forests, with a single road leading inside.</p><p><br></p><p>The place was divided into different sections for different animals, so that many don’t hunt others into extinction. The forests contain a lot of smaller creatures like the Cheese Rabbits and Billion Birds which while not exactly small per say, were still a good source of food for the predators. These smaller animals were bred in a separate section of the ranch and released into the forests at different times if their numbers were found to be lower than normal.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is this place?” Sepus asked, looking around but not finding anything.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is my Ranch. I keep all sorts of animals in this place. We need to go through the road to reach the main area.”</p><p><br></p><p>The rest followed me and when the small forest area ended, everyone saw the true beauty of my ranch. A series of connected lakes which received water from the Water Tree spread over the area.</p><p><br></p><p>This was the Watering Area which I had set as an area of non aggression. This area was planted with Peaceful Flowers and the farm system was set such that there would be no fights in this area.</p><p><br></p><p>The result was that scores of animals drank water from the same waters. Dragons and rabbits, wolves and deers, everyone drank water together and lazed around without a trace of aggression.</p><p><br></p><p>“This area is an area of Non-Aggression. Animals are not allowed to fight in this area. You can even play with the animals here and they will not attack. I modelled this area after the Familiar Forest with some of my own twists to it. Obviously, the area over which this ranch spreads is currently less than the Familiar Forest but I will change it soon enough.”</p><p><br></p><p>The Familiar Forest is spread over an area almost quarter of the Buné Lands. My Ranch, while big, still has ways to go before it reaches even close to that.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, I am pretty sure, my Ranch can easily surpass the overall potential of the animals in the Familiar Forest.</p><p><br></p><p>There are over eighty dragons on the farm right now.</p><p><br></p><p>Most of them are young but have taken a lot of Farming Points for me to buy.</p><p><br></p><p>They were then fed specialised animal feeds and animals from the Toriko World.</p><p><br></p><p>This made them enter a massive growth spurt. I expect that by the time I am eighteen and of age, I will have a decent army of Dragons who will be at the peak of C+ Rank at the very least. It also helps that Tia personally trains the Dragons in this area… well by more or less beating the crap out of them on a weekly basis. They also spar among themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>It reminded me of the Charicific Valley, where Ash left his Charizard.</p><p><br></p><p>As I was thinking about these things, we heard a roar and a blue spot flew from a distance towards us.</p><p><br></p><p>Some people were alerted but Armin stepped forward,  \"Don't attack.\" He said and soon the spot, which was actually a deep blue coloured dragon, crashed into him, licking his face as if an overgrown puppy. It was a normal scene. \"Yes, Ella. I missed you too.\"</p><p><br></p><p>He caressed the Dragon's face and cleared off the dust from her magnificent blue scales.</p><p><br></p><p>\"She is Eleanor, Armin's dragon. She is very close to Armin because he always personally takes care of her.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"She is beautiful.\" Latia replied, looking at the scales of the elephant sized dragon. \"What kind of Dragon is it?\" She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Adamantine Dragon.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Like the legendary metal Adamantine?\" Latia asked, looking curiously at me.</p><p><br></p><p>\"What metal?\" Rias on the other hand was confused. It was understandable because it was not even heard of in the current times.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Adamantine is a rare metal that was used to make the strongest types of weapons and armours. They are resistant to metals and can hold huge amounts of enchantments. It was used to make artifacts by the Father of the Angels and the Original Satan Lucifer. Some of the strongest known swords like the Durandal and Gram are made of this metal. Although, all the known reserves of the metal have been used up. In the current times, only the armours worn by the Satans have some parts made up of Adamantine. Maybe the Bael house has some of it, but that's it. The rest of the Adamantine in the possession of the three factions has been lost in the Great War and the Civil War. I take it that the Dragon is a defensive type because of the name it carries?\" Sirzechs explained calmly to her.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Yes. It is a defensive type of dragon. Although, the title is not because of its defensive abilities but rather because of the Adamantine Scales of the dragon itself. It has a very thin layer of Adamantine on its scales, which thickens over time absorbing its magic. When it reaches adulthood, its scales will fully turn into Adamantine and it will be an insane tank.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Real Adamantine!\" I think it was Zeoticus's shout.</p><p><br></p><p>Ajuka made some magic circles to check Armin's dragon to verify my words.</p><p><br></p><p>It did take twenty thousand points to buy a hatchling of the dragon but it will be worth it.</p><p><br></p><p>I have a total of five such dragons while Armin's dragon is the youngest of them all.</p><p><br></p><p>\"It is indeed Adamantine.\" Confirmed Ajuka, getting the results of the test.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Are you planning to sell these dragons?\" Zeoticus asked.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Sell? No. This one was a gift for Armin. I am not selling any. I mean, what kind of a Buné would I be if I didn't have a few dragons for myself. I know the amount of chaos these will cause if sold, so I will keep these to myself. I might sell Adamantine in small quantities though. But even that won't be until the Dragons grow into adults and shed their scales. It's a long way away.\"</p><p><br></p><p>“You know the amount of chaos? What a surprise?\" Leila rolled her eyes at me. \"You really need to sit down with me for some classes again. It will help beat some common sense into you, maybe?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I disagree. Common Sense is for common people. For people who can bring change, they always think uncommonly. Magic, if restrained by common sense, becomes just that… common. Not the special source of miracles that can bring revolutionary changes to the world. Someone like Mathias will just hamper his potential if he restricts himself with common sense.\" Surprisingly, the one who spoke was Euclid. \"Everything we have seen inside is a product of his uncommon thinking and it has resulted in several miracles which can change our world.\" He explained himself and I looked at the man in surprise because of the passion in his voice. I had observed him and he was looking and taking notes about several things.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I am not talking about restricting his creativity. I have some experience with Ajuka. What I want is for him to not accidentally crash the Underworld's economy or bring other factions seeking out our resources when they are revealed. Also, I know the kind of person this little moron is. Telling him not to do farming is the same as telling Ajuka to not do Science. It's not going to work.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Okay. No one is stopping anyone here.\" Sirzechs intervened. He then looked at me. \"Mathias. You can do your experiments as long as it doesn't hurt you. I just ask you to inform us about any new products that you think might be revolutionary to us so that we might prepare some contingency in case any future problems arise from the product.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Understandable. These guys have to manage an unruly race like the devils. Moreover they have helped me a lot. This much is something that I owe them all.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I will keep it in mind.\" I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>The rest of the tour was more or less normal. I still didn't show them the hidden biomes of the farm and some of the B Ranked products. Those will be revealed later.</p><p><br></p><p>It was finally time for my birthday party.</p><p><br></p><p>But something else came before that.</p><p><br></p><p>One of my dryads appeared before me.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Danger… beasts… more than one… strong… Lavy stay to protect… More help… need.\"</p><p><br></p><p>She was still relatively younger and spoke in broken words.</p><p><br></p><p>Although, her words were plenty clear. She was a part of Lavinia's team of hunters.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Which place? Point me.\" I asked, ignoring the looks of the others who were looking at the interaction.</p><p><br></p><p>\"That way. I show.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Is something the matter, Mathias?\" Sirzechs approached me.</p><p><br></p><p>\"One of my people is in danger. There is a demonic beast attack. Pardon me for a while. I will be right back.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Is it dangerous? I will send someone from my peerage to help you out.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"That… Please don't trouble yourself. It will be fine. Please enjoy yourself. I will be back in a bit.\" I took the dryad in my arms and had her point towards the location.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>– Beowulf –</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Bewoulf was sent after the birthday boy who ran off to rescue his peerage member or something in between his own birthday party. This alone was more than enough to separate him from the other stuffy nobles who had their heads up their… </p><p><br></p><p>The guy was quite cool and the food he grew were downright the most delicious things he had ever eaten in his relatively long life.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Mr. Bewoulf, please let me join too.\" He heard a voice from behind him and saw Falbium's little brother flying behind.</p><p><br></p><p>He did hear that the boys were quite strong so it should be fine. Even if nothing else, they could escape, so he nodded to the boy and both of them flew towards the direction where Mathias Buné had flown towards. A while later, he sensed strong demonic power being thrown around and a little further was a scene of battle.</p><p><br></p><p>There was broken ice covering a large part of the land along with a huge demonic beast. However what attracted his attention was not that but the three remaining Demonic Beasts, each of which looked to be well into the Ultimate Class.</p><p><br></p><p>A thick skinned Rhinoceros, a vulture that was flying above and a feline that looked like a liger.</p><p><br></p><p>A girl was lying exhausted on her knees and there was another person standing beside her while the Buné was walking towards the three beasts as if taking a walk in the park.</p><p><br></p><p>He flew down to the girl and realised that the person standing beside her was none other than Tiamat, the strongest of the Dragon Kings. \"Let me help out.\" He called out to the Buné.</p><p><br></p><p>\"It's fine. I can take care of this.\" He replied, still walking normally and not even looking back.</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah, fuck Euclid. This boy needed to learn common sense.</p><p><br></p><p>Even he would have problems fighting all three of these beasts at once.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Well yeah. They are decent but Matty can manage them by himself.\" This time it was the Glasya-Labolas.</p><p><br></p><p>No, maybe all these children need a lesson in common sense.</p><p><br></p><p>He tried to follow nonetheless but his shoulder was grabbed by Tiamat. \"He said it's fine. Don't worry about it. Mathias will be just fine.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"But… those are…\" He tried to argue. Tiamat is the most dangerous of all the Dragon Kings and probably the easiest to provoke, thus he held back his words.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Heh, to think he could have this kind of look on his face.\" He heard her snort looking at the scene.</p><p><br></p><p>\"What look?\" The Glasya-Labolas Heir asked.</p><p><br></p><p>\"The look of a dragon.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"But, what does that mean?\" The boy asked, confused.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Tell me. Have you ever seen him actually getting angry at… well anything?\"</p><p><br></p><p>The boy thought for a moment before answering her, \"Mildly irritated, sometimes annoyed but no, I don't think I have seen him getting angry ever. Back then, when two of his pet dragons fought and burned down a large patch of the rice fields, he had just made them clean up the mess and got to work without a word. I was pretty sure that those two punks were going to get a beating of a lifetime.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Dragons are temperamental beings, mainly guided by their pride and rage. Evil dragons have more sins than these two but even they have these as their core. Some can attack you just for looking wrong at them. Those two muscle heads, Ddraig and Albion weren't the only rowdy ones. I remember Great Red had sunk Atlantis to the bottom of the ocean because its ruler had offended him. He tried to control Great Red and his entire country paid the price for it.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Atlantis existed!?\" He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Obviously. It was long before the devil race was even created. Lucifer was still the loyal attack dog of his father. It was quite a flourishing civilization. Only one person escaped and that too because Great Red didn't want to hunt a species to extinction. Even the Biblical God collected a few things from there, namely, the soul of the king of Atlantis. It was later made into a trinket or as you call it, Sacred Gear which could control the sea and dragons…. Nereid Kyrie.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Who was the ruler of Atlantis? Also, who escaped the destruction of Atlantis?\" The boy asked and even he wanted to hear the answer to this question now.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Leviathan.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"What!\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"She was the daughter of the ruler of Atlantis, strong but still nothing compared to her father.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"But… Didn't Satan Leviathan have a demonic beast heritage? I mean that's what the records say.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Do you think the ruler of a race would reveal that she had run away when her home was destroyed and hid in the pits in fear of the enemy? She was no demonic beast. She hid in the pits because she was afraid that Great Red would come for her. The demonic energies of the pits changed her magical power to demonic power. Why do you think she was called the 'Sea Serpent of the End' when there are no seas in the Underworld? It was her father's title. That dragon was strong. Far stronger than any of the Satans including the current ones, rivalling the likes of Indra and would have become even stronger if he wasn't so overconfident.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Mathias is nothing like that though. Could it be because his Zagan side is stronger than his Buné?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Obviously not. His Zagan side is strong. I agree. But, his Buné side is just as, if not stronger and yet… He never resorts to violence first. So… Seeing this look on his face, makes me anticipate the side of him that I have never seen before.\"</p><p><br></p><p>The girl on the other hand ate what seemed to be the Senzu Beans mentioned earlier in the medical section.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked with amazement as she got up as if her previous exhausted state was but a lie.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl tried to go towards the Buné but was stopped quickly by Tiamat. \"You just reached your Balance Breaker. Without sufficient control over it, you would only get in his way. The fight is over as it is.\"</p><p><br></p><p>And he looked forward to see that the Rhinoceros Demonic Beast charging towards the young Buné at full speed. The boy however didn't even falter and kept walking.</p><p><br></p><p>He, despite the warnings of Tiamat, was about to take action only to see a scene that made his jaws drop to the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy raised an arm and the beast crashed into him… only to be stopped in its tracks.</p><p><br></p><p>The scene was a bit comical but just as mind blowing. The huge beast was stopped with a single hand by the boy who looked like a bug in front of it.</p><p><br></p><p>The next thing, the boy kicked it below its jaws and a shockwave spread all around the area.</p><p><br></p><p>The beast fell to the ground, completely unmoving. He put a foot on its head and with his hand still gripping the horn, he yanked it, breaking it from the base.</p><p><br></p><p>He then flung it towards the vulture and the sonic boom from. The throw resounded throughout the area.</p><p><br></p><p>The vulture had no chance.</p><p><br></p><p>It was torn apart upwards from its torso.</p><p><br></p><p>The last beast had closed the distance in this time and pounced but its end was probably the most surprising.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy grabbed the leg of the Rhinoceros beast and used the corpse as a bludgeon to smash the liger into the ground, causing the whole place to shake and a massive crater to appear there.</p><p><br></p><p>All three of the beasts were dead, in less than 20 seconds.</p><p><br></p><p>Beowulf began doubting his life.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>– Mathias – </strong></p><p><br></p><p>\"Thank you for taking care of her, Tia. Are you alright now Lavinia?\" I asked the girl who was looking at me in a daze. She nodded slightly but didn't stop staring at me.</p><p><br></p><p> \"Let's go back. We can't keep everyone at the party waiting.\" I said and stepped forward.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Wait, you are going to leave those beast corpses lying just like that?\" Beowulf asked.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hmm… No, the dryads and my hunting squads will take the bodies to be used as food and fertiliser.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"What about the skin and fur?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"What about them? My squads are a bit picky but the rest can be used as fertiliser.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"How about I buy them from you?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"You want to buy those? I mean yeah, the liger fur would be decent for decorative clothes, but still. I mean sure. No need for money. Just take them.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"This… No no, it would be too much.\" He denied.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Don't worry Mr. Beowulf. Consider it my thanks for coming to assist me.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Eh… Thank you then. Call me up for help if you need anything.\" He scratched his head before replying.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________________________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>We reached back via teleportation so it was faster.</p><p><br></p><p>On reaching back, Sirzechs approached me first. \"Was everything fine?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"It was just a minor problem. Apparently, Tia had been watching over her the entire time so she wasn't in any real danger. She didn't interfere previously to push her to attain the Balance Breaker for her Sacred Gear, which she did. So, I guess things were good enough. I gave her a Senzu Bean and she is fine now\" Balance Breaker increases the power by a whole lot too. It was evident by the fact that even against four Ultimate Class Demonic beasts, she was able to hold them back and kill one of them before I arrived. She hadn’t taken her Senzu Beans with her but more importantly, she was holding the beasts back from killing her team. She has taken a real liking to her team, treating her as a family.</p><p><br></p><p>The abandonment of her teacher had led her to latch onto any source of affection.</p><p><br></p><p>\"A Balance Breaker is always good news. Congratulations. Tiamat didn't join you?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"She had something to do and will visit later.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Ah, such a shame. Come, everyone is waiting for you to cut the cake.\"</p><p><br></p><p>The rest of the party was quite simple.</p><p><br></p><p>I cut the cake and got several gifts. Personally written books on Magic from Mathers and Ajuka, a book on Genetics based magic - Biomancy from Euclid. A complete set of clothes from the Gremory's latest limited fashion line. A set of two, five thousand year old wine bottles from my teacher and Septus, a Katana from Okita Souji, a bracelet with barrier magic from Armin and Falbium and several other things from others.</p><p><br></p><p>There were also handmade gifts from my Dryads and peerage members. These people were making something for me in secret. The three had worked in secret with Lavinia and Sai's help to make me a pair of sweaters and mufflers. Ingvild did the knitting while the others collected the materials without letting me know. My Dryad’s had prepared a garden with a swing in my backyard for me to rest.</p><p><br></p><p>The best birthday I have had in this world.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, I was brought to a different room by Leila and Venelana for something.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Sit Mathias.\" I did as was told and asked Ingvild to bring us something to drink.</p><p><br></p><p>The two ladies took a seat in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>\"We have something important to talk about with you but understand something first, no one is forcing anything on you. We just want you to consider this.\"</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded at Leila.</p><p><br></p><p>\"You are sixteen years old now. In two years, you will be eighteen and of age and will have to take responsibility for your house as the Lord. Normally, these things are done by parents, but as your teacher, I thought I should tell you this personally.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Ughh… Am I going to get <em>the talk</em>? I think we can skip it since I do know about the <em>birds and bees</em> and all.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Venelana giggled while my teacher rolled her eyes at me. \"No dear. Devil children, especially boys, don't need the <em>talk</em> from their parents. This is about something else.\"</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Leila who took a deep breath. \"I don't want to run around circles with you. We are here to propose the engagement between you, Rias and Latia.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Huh! This… what?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Normally Heirs of the house get engaged by the age of fourteen at most. This is done by the parents. You are sixteen and still not engaged, partly because of your situation. I will not lie and say that I am doing this completely selflessly. Latia being engaged to you would bring great benefits to our house but… most of all, you will treat my daughter well.\"</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Venelana who continued on further. \"We devils are selfish beings, Mathias. But that doesn't mean we don't care for our children. Once your identity is revealed, there will be scores of people trying to get their sisters and daughters engaged to you for various reasons. Some good, some not so. Currently the number of Pure Blooded Devils has dwindled a lot and thus some laws were passed at the end of the Civil Wars that required a house to only have a Pure Blooded Head. It was partly to conserve their own blood, and partly because of their own bigotry and fearing the reincarnated devils would take over the ruling class one day, seducing or assassinating their way up. The choice is all yours. We have this opportunity and we are taking it before others. This is just a logical and beneficial choice for all of us. Although, knowing Leila, she would have suggested you someone if not Latia because you are her student.” She explained in a calm tone.</p><p><br></p><p>“I obviously would have. As far as I know him, he would say something blunt to someone else who pushed him too hard and they would make a mountain out of a molehill.”</p><p><br></p><p>There was certainly such a law. The Devils were extremely particular about bloodline purity and the fact that the half Devils have a much lower chance of inheriting Clan Traits. In fact, I remember that if I hadn’t shown the signs of the Clan Traits, my Houses would have ended with me. In fact, even the stipend I got was four times more than what someone without a clan trait would have got. Moreover, I would rather call on Great Red and threaten to blast the bastards if they tried to force some girl on me than bend to a loveless marriage for hopefully a very long life with some girl who would be with me for money or politics. Considering these, Rias and Latia are much better because I know both of them and they are not exactly interested in my riches nor are they bigotted, which is a rarity in the Devil society. </p><p><br></p><p>I mean it’s not like I don’t want to get married.</p><p><br></p><p>Hmm, what to do?</p><p><br></p><p>“Do they know of this and agree to it?” I asked, looking back up after a while of thinking. Seeing Venelana’s raised eyebrow I explained. “Before anything, they are my friends, something I have very few of. If they do not know or agree with this, I will not sour my friendship over it. Moreover, in my personal opinion, something like marriage, especially between long lived races like us needs the agreement of both sides because, ultimately the one who has to spend their lives together is us and thus both of us should get equal say. I am sorry if my words offended you. I know this is not the norm in Devil society but I don’t want to take such an important step if the other side doesn’t agree.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, not something like, ‘I will only marry someone I love’? Isn’t this is, what’s it called, yeah….’in trend’ nowadays?” Venelana asked me with a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>“I… I believe that something like love develops over time and by knowing the other person. Love at first sight, I don’t know if that exists but it feels very strange to me. How can someone fall in love with someone they don’t even know? The only ones who love you like that are your parents… and sometimes not even that. Moreover, liking someone at first sight would be just based on their looks, and well, half the devil population is beautiful. Just because someone is beautiful doesn’t mean they are good and would make a good life partner. Sometimes even good friends don’t make for good couples. Understanding and compatibility between people is very important for a lasting relationship like marriage.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Unfortunately, most of the children nowadays don’t understand this. We just want you three to get to know each other with the thought of marriage. It’s not like anyone can sign a marriage contract in your name. I mean sure, Sirzechs or Ajuka can do it, but they are going to be on the pointed end of the arguments when your identity is revealed. Them, signing any contract between you and Rias or Latia or both would raise a shitstorm. Any contract you sign, will be done by you, yourself, when you are of age. We have two years till then. You all can get to know each other by then and decide what to do.”</p><p><br></p><p>“If they agree with this, I don’t see a problem in getting to know each other.” I mean, it’s just knowing each other. We still have a few years before they come of age to decide. If things work by then, I don’t see why not. And so, with a few more things and a long lecture from Leila on common sense(Euclid really thought that she would give up because he protested. I pity his naivety), I returned to the party.</p><p><br></p><p>_____________________________________x___________________________________________________________________________x______________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: LuluViBritania(FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>This chapter might have come out as a bit of an exhibition but it was something I needed to get out of the way.

They got along quite fine. Well, Gasper had fainted so he needed to wake up first before fainting again. It was both hilarious and worrying.</p><p><br></p><p>During this time, Valerie, Gasper and Ingvild decided to join my peerage. Lavinia needed some more time. The abandonment from her teacher had hit her hard and she wasn’t willing to trust anyone closely.</p><p><br></p><p>Valerie became my Bishop while Gasper and Ingvild became a Pawn which took two and four of my pieces respectively.</p><p><br></p><p>I had to upgrade my Magic to B+ level just to use my pieces more efficiently. Still it took more than one pawn piece for those two. It went on to show how scary their potentials were.</p><p><br></p><p>As they opened up more, I realized that Valerie is a natural prankster. Gasper is a really gullible kid who invokes sympathy from those around him. Ingvild is a shy girl who likes singing and taking care of plants. She wants to be a singer and perform someday. I totally support her decision and so do the others. In fact even Tiamat enjoys her singing.</p><p><br></p><p>When Armin came back the next day, he was in a frustrated mood. He never answered exactly what had happened, just that he wanted to increase our training. I gladly increased both the load and our food quality. He was actually quite surprised that I got these new members but Tiamat came to the rescue and said that she found them and brought them here.</p><p><br></p><p>She convinced me to keep Great Red a secret from anyone because I didn’t want to hide things from my buddy. Apparently, the fact that <em>He</em> will interfere in anything would just raise a lot of eyebrows and that’s not the kind of attention I want now.</p><p>Sai came back later on and gave me the news that he will be getting his Evil Pieces and that he has found potential recruits too, one of which include Ladora, my distant cousin.</p><p><br></p><p>He lives with his parents who had once offered to take me in but they were quite poor themselves and I didn’t want to impose on them. I also had my Farm to take care of. I did want to help them out but was advised to wait till the reveal or the money would be tracked back to me in case someone tried.</p><p><br></p><p>If Ladora joined Sai’s peerage I would be able to help him out properly.</p><p><br></p><p>The other one is Kuisha Abaddon who wanted to participate in the Rating Games but was not allowed to by her family.</p><p><br></p><p>Sai being the naive and lovable fool gave her a thumbs up and promised her a position in his peerage and she agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>And the thing I had been waiting for so long finally happened yesterday. I summoned a pet.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure you want to make this into a Familiar?” Armin asked, looking at the creature in front of him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Pretty sure. This one is the best I can think of.” I replied as I caressed my adorable pet and it mewled into my chest.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is it because it has plants on its back?”</p><p><br></p><p>“One of the many points that just makes it all the more awesome.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Still… a deer? Even if it’s a bit odd, it’s still a deer.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A Sky Deer.” I corrected.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. A Sky <em>Deer</em>.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Trust me, this little guy will be a kickass partner in a few years. The best thing is that although eating food helps it grow faster. In a good enough environment, it can grow by photosynthesis too. It can live almost an infinite amount of time although its growth rate will be far slower if that happened.”</p><p><br></p><p>“With the amount of stuff you are feeding it, I seriously doubt it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hey, it’s not like you don’t like it. You are already making a portrait of us.” I pouted.</p><p><br></p><p>“I never said I didn’t like it. It’s adorable in its own way. I am just surprised that you would make it your familiar when you have a farm full of Dragons. Ones that I remind you, almost any devil in the underworld would kill to get as a familiar.” He replied as he put the last shades to the painting before taking a look at it from a distance.</p><p><br></p><p>“This young guy is stronger than my strongest creation and will only grow stronger in time. Aren’t you the strongest one?” I scratched the back of its ears and it rubbed its face on my palm.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, this is the pet I choose. Sky Deer from Toriko.</p><p><br></p><p>Calm and peaceful unless provoked. One of the calmest types of creatures in Toriko. Still it didn't mean that they should be underestimated. A Sky Deer, the Deer King was one of the strongest beings of the Toriko world.</p><p><br></p><p>The reason why I choose this one is because it can control time. It can increase the flow of time in an area from hundreds to millions of times. The little guy can't do anything that extreme yet, but it can still increase the flow of time on a small area, a few times over. When it grows a bit, it will be able to do so, increasing the production of the entire farm by several times.</p><p><br></p><p>Not to mention the Deer King was someone who could match even Great Red in terms of power and mostly liked to just sleep in peace without a care in the world.</p><p><br></p><p>\"So, anything happened back at home?\" I asked, changing the topic.</p><p><br></p><p>He sighed as he sat down beside me and caressed the leafy mane of my Sky Deer, Leafa.</p><p><br></p><p>\"The stress about the Rating Game debut. They asked me to recruit some peerage members. Until now I only have one peerage member and she studies under mother to learn about her duties. Moreover she is a pawn. They want me to get some numbers. Father however didn't bring this topic up since that sham of a fight against Edward.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Still, you are pretty strong. I wonder how strong that Edward must be for him to hold back? Also, I thought that many House Heads didn't even participate in the Rating Games, so why is it so important all of a sudden.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"My house is focused on military and strategy departments. It is a way for us to show that our house is still in strong hands. It's mainly the politics of the houses. The Current Satans and the other factions.\" He sighed softly and laid down on the grass.</p><p><br></p><p>\"You could take your Dragon from the Ranch, you know. The little guy is plenty strong.\"</p><p><br></p><p>I had gifted him a dragon hatchling on his birthday. He kept it on the ranch mostly so it could live among the other dragons and grow stronger. He did take care of the dragon all by himself though. Even hunted the food, cleaned it and fed it all by himself. The dragon on the other hand was almost on the level of a High Class Devil in terms of strength. It was just a year old though but the food it ate did wonders for it. Armin is mostly a defensive fighter so the Dragon I gave him was Adamantium Dragon hatchling. It cost me twenty thousand points.</p><p><br></p><p>\"No. It will attract too much attention towards you if I do that. People can piece things together and connect it to you. It will be troublesome.\"</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>\"I am getting kinda annoyed with the people. Don't they have better things to do?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Yeah, tell me about it.\"</p><p><br></p><p>I thought about something and remembered about something. Should I involve Armin with the mess though?</p><p><br></p><p>\"There is someone I heard about from Tiamat. He is thought to have a very strong Sacred Gear, although nothing is verified. It's just that the background of the guy is a bit problematic depending on the way you look at it.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"How strong are we talking about?\" He asked, without looking at me.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Longinus.\"</p><p><br></p><p>He snapped in my direction almost instantly. \"Are you insane, Matty?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hey! Why is it that every time I try to help someone, they either call me insane or a fool. You are my friend. You are in a pinch and I am helping you. How is that me being crazy or stupid?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Do you not understand what a Longinus means? Houses would go on a war just for a chance to gain them. No, entire factions start wars for those and you are talking about them without any care in the world.<em> that!</em> is indeed stupid.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"A Longinus is strong… But it doesn't make someone invincible. Stop worrying about it.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"You are impossible…\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Thanks. Now, listen. In Ryoukou High School, Japan. There are several top class Sacred Gear users. Tobio Ikuse, Shigune Nanadaru, Natsume Minagawa, Kouki Samejima and Hyousuke Koga all wield extremely powerful Sacred Gears.\" I told him the location of the school in general. It was a year before I remembered the ship being crashed and assuming Ingvild, Valerie and Lavinia had the same Sacred Gears, it was a valid guess. If it's the same, well and good. If not, well no skin off my back.</p><p><br></p><p>To be honest, they would at best be at the Dragon King level when trained properly and while strong for the world… it's a bit average by my Farm's standards.</p><p><br></p><p>In a few years, I would be able to create minions of that level so, them helping out Armin would be much better.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Are you sure about it?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Quite.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"You are very troublesome, you know that, right?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"So, that's how people say thank you nowadays? You're welcome, I guess?\"</p><p><br></p><p>We bickered a bit and then I told him everything I recalled about the background information of the people in the Slash Dog novels that I could remember.</p><p><br></p><p>I hope they will be able to help him out. I would simply give him enough of my creations to fill up his peerage but the guy was quite stubborn and wouldn’t accept it.</p><p><br></p><p>Honourable devils are a rarity.</p><p><br></p><p>As we were talking, I felt a teleportation circle near us. Assuming they were teleporting right into my territory, the identities were easy to narrow down.</p><p><br></p><p>And just as I thought, a crimson Magic Circle lit up and out came Mathers and Rias.</p><p><br></p><p>Armin and I got up and Leafa looked at the new arrivals in curiosity.</p><p><br></p><p>“Matty. Heir Glasya-Labolas.” Rias called us as Mathers followed him.</p><p><br></p><p>Armin looked at me. “Why are you Matty and me, Heir Glasya-Labolas?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am more likeable, I guess. Maybe I have better ‘People Skills’.” I shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>He rolled his eyes at my reply. “I am surprised you even know that word.” He snorted.</p><p><br></p><p>“Rias. Welcome. Teacher Mathers.” I greeted the girl and nodded towards my magic teacher.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mathias. Heir Glasya-Labolas.” He greeted me back and I stifled a snort at the face Armin made.</p><p><br></p><p>“Matty, I have come to invite you to my birthday party. Oh! Is this a new demonic beast?” She asked, looking at my Leafa.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is my Familiar. Isn’t she pretty?”</p><p><br></p><p>She slowly caressed the Sky Deer’s head and it mewled, making the girl squeal.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s so cute. What’s it called?” She asked, now playing with the deer already and feeding it some veggies we had with us.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s a Sky Deer. So, what was it about a birthday?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! Yes. My Birthday is two weeks from now and I wanted to invite you to it. You can come and bring a peerage member or friend with you if you want. I was going to Sona’s place after this but I needed to invite Sai too so I came here first.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sai is… asleep. He just went to take a rest an hour ago after working out. I will inform him to have a talk with you, if you are in a hurry.” I offered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then I won’t wake him up. Thanks for that, Matty.” Leafa was already playing with her by now and she was totally engrossed in it too.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, this will be your sixteenth birthday. Your debut. Feeling pressured?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mother has been pushing me to take the etiquette lessons and making me memorise all the names of the House Heads and Heirs as well as the Ultimate Class Devils. It’s boring.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am bored even thinking of it so I can imagine your pain.” I contacted Ingvild to bring us something to eat. The C Ranked Produce was quite tasty and I saved a large amount for myself. The fruits especially. The ones from the Toriko world are just a delight. I continued the conversation till then. “Any ideas about your peerage members?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I mean Akeno is a sure thing by now. She will be my queen. I haven't looked for anyone else yet. What about you? Anyone you got in your peerage?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hmm. I got a few members recently. They are a fun bunch. Most of them are taking care of the farm. I will introduce you to them when you are not in a rush.”</p><p><br></p><p>As we were talking, Ingvild appeared with plates of food floating around her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is she your peerage member?” Mathers asked, looking at her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Umu. Her name is Ingvild. Tia brought some people who wanted a place to live and I recruited them. She is my new pawn.” I introduced them as we started on the food before us.</p><p><br></p><p>The dishes were surprise apples, cuticle berry and appudding.</p><p><br></p><p>“What are these fruits, Mathias?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The berry is called Cuticle Berry. It makes people’s hair shinier and healthier. Sometimes  even bald people can grow hair from eating them. The other one is a surprise apple. They get tastier depending on how much you can surprise the apple and believe me, they are hard to scare. The last one is called Appudding. They are custard pudding flavoured apples. Nutritious and delicious. These are some of the things I just produced.”</p><p><br></p><p>Enough to say, no one else was paying attention, already too busy to clean the plates of their contents. Rias was eating some and feeding some to Leafa.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ahh… I wish I could eat this everyday. The fruits of your farm are just too good.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, I will think of something then. Maybe in the future, you can.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Really? Promise?” She looked brightly at me and I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Promise. But only if you want it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Agreed. I want it then.”</p><p><br></p><p>And just like that I had an idea about what to give her for her birthday.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Sirzechs Lucifer -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“So that’s the report about the meeting with the Shinto.” Serafall completed her report as he looked around the room.</p><p><br></p><p>“And that’s basically everything for the official business.” He concluded.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are just in a hurry to plan for your sister’s birthday, aren’t you?” Serafall teased.</p><p><br></p><p>“As if you aren’t the same. Unlike me you started the work six months earlier.” He replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“You both have serious sister issues.” Falbium yawned.</p><p><br></p><p>“You would know if you had a sister.” He retorted. But then again, knowing the guy, he wouldn’t really care. Also didn’t he have a cousin sister?</p><p><br></p><p>“I have my hands full with just a brother.” He sighed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did Zephyrdos do something again?” He asked, relaxing a bit in his chair.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh no. It was Armin. But again I guess it was due to Zephyrdos, so I guess you could also say that.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Heh. Even Armin has a rebellious phase? I never thought I would see that cute little boy go through something like that.” Serafall smiled and he agreed. Armin was always too soft spoken and a true gentleman.</p><p><br></p><p>“It was something else. Armin is still the obedient boy as always. <em>Sigh</em> Let me explain it from the beginning. It all started with Zephyrdos tattling to Father about Armin disappearing for long periods of time and missing training.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. Mathers and Sai both told me that Armin often visits the Buné territory to meet Mathias and they spar together. Those two hit it off quite well.” He was actually happy that Mathias got a good friend in someone like Armin instead of someone else with a less… pleasant personality. Then again, knowing the boy, he would never get along with that sort of person.</p><p><br></p><p>“They do. I had a talk with Armin about Mathias and they keep everything that happens in the farm a secret. I have no idea what kind of training they do or what but he’s been eating and training there almost everyday he’s free. So, coming back to the topic at hand. Father was worried and asked him to show the results of his training for the past year in a spar against Edward.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Your father’s butler? He was a pretty competent fighter and Armin’s teacher if I remember correctly? Armin must have had a tough time?”</p><p><br></p><p>“He was but no… Armin didn’t have a tough time. In fact he didn’t take any time at all. He ended the fight with one punch.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The little brat punched through a defence circle and broke fourteen of Edward’s bones and blasted him into unconsciousness with a single punch. That’s not even the end of it all. Somehow Armin has the idea that Edward was holding back and giving him an easy win so he’s engrossed himself even more into training. We hardly ever see him at home. Father on the other hand is over the moon and has completely forbidden anyone from telling Armin the truth when he found out about the misunderstanding. He even had me test him and he was an Ultimate Class with just his ridiculous physique. Just what kind of training do they do in that place because if I can, I want to get my soldiers that!”</p><p><br></p><p>“I have heard that he is experimenting with different types of crops and he sometimes sends something with Sai but nothing overly outrageous for the fear of leaking the information. Do you know of anything, Ajuka? What about the talks of him being engaged to your niece?” He asked Ajuka.</p><p><br></p><p>“My sister doesn’t ask him about any of his work until he himself speaks of it. As for the engagement talks, she is waiting for him to become sixteen which is in about a month. She will talk to him about it then. She’s just letting him and Latia get to know each other so that none of them freak out at the news.” Ajuka replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you think it’s something better than what he started making at the start? I mean it was understandable considering the initial products but still… I don’t think even the Original Zagan had this kind of power… because that would be…” said Serafall.</p><p><br></p><p>“In these years, I managed to unearth some books about the Zagan and none of them have any mentions of this. I mean sure, he could have hidden his real abilities as every house does but…”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s no use worrying about what we don’t know. What we know however is that Mathias is a good natured boy who has no political agendas, is close to all our siblings and is someone who can single-handedly change the entire food industry and even more in the Underworld in the coming years. His friendship with Armin and the effect he has had on both Armin and Sairaorg are proof that what we have been doing until now is fine. Let him do whatever he wants. We just need to prepare for when his identity is revealed. I can already feel the headache thinking about the argument with Zekram when this comes out.”</p><p><br></p><p>\"I have heard that he got some peerage members brought to him by Tiamat. I didn't think she would take such a liking to him.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"It's good news anyways.\"</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, you said that Armin always spars with Mathias. Who wins?” Ajuka asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Falbium looked in though for a moment. “No idea. Armin didn’t speak about it. Still if my guess is correct, they must be more or less equal in strength.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm… so an Ultimate Class in strength. If he keeps training for the next few years and maintains the same kind of progress, we can be secure about his safety.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Still… Ultimate Class at sixteen and seventeen is quite an achievement. Apart from you two and <em>him</em>, I cannot think of anyone else who was similar. I mean even I was at the Peak of High Class strength when I was sixteen.” Serafall commented and he had to agree. At the same time, another thought popped up in his mind. The one Ajuka had said a long time ago.</p><p><br></p><p>Another one like them.</p><p><br></p><p>Ughh… if that was the case, then the headache in the meeting with Zekram would be even worse.</p><p><br></p><p>He will deal with it when it’s time.</p><p><br></p><p>Right now, he had to prepare for his Ria-tan’s birthday.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Mathias -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Another Birthday party. Another relative of a Satan, the same situation as before.</p><p><br></p><p>This time however I had friends with me.</p><p><br></p><p>Not to mention, the little pieces of shit were keeping a distance from me due to Zephyrdos being scared of Armin. It was a welcome change.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Did you finally get around to choosing a gift? Also, I hope you didn't just bring a basket of fruits from your farm.\" Armin asked while taking a look over the food but not picking anything up.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hey, what's wrong with my fruits? I am sure they will cost more than an average Middle Class Devil's yearly income should I place them on the market.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"But you can't and people will be quick to mock you and we don't need that now, do we?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"You know, the more I hear about these <em>people</em>, the more annoyed I get. Sometimes I wonder if they live on food or vanity?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Vanity, obviously.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Ah, then my farm business is ruined before it even starts.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"So, what did you get?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"A basket of fruits.\"</p><p><br></p><p>… </p><p><br></p><p>… </p><p><br></p><p>\"Matty, you…\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Trust me, it won't be mocked. Remember the ones I showed you which took me three years to grow?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Those?\" He paused his tirade at the mention of the fruit</p><p><br></p><p>\"A few of those and a Rainbow Fruit.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I thought the Rainbow Fruits needed some more time to mature? Also a few of <em>those</em>?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"They are just fruits. I have plenty of them and can always grow more. As for the Rainbow Fruits, I managed a last second miracle.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"But still…\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"So, would they mock this?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Not really. It might get troublesome for completely different reasons.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Then I couldn’t care less.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Since when did you start to care to actually care less?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Touché.\"</p><p><br></p><p>The evening progressed and I met my teacher and Latia too.</p><p><br></p><p>She asked me the same thing about the gift.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I gave it to my new peerage members to pack. I couldn't trust myself with the aesthetics of the packaging. They would know better as three of them are girls.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I never got to meet your peerage members. I heard they were introduced to you by Tiamat so their credibility should not be in question but they need to be trained in etiquette too. Do they have proper training?\" She asked me and I winced remembering the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>Tiamat wouldn't give a fuck about etiquette. She never did before and she most certainly wouldn't do so now. Lavinia is mostly ignorant about the world. Valerie and Gasper, the less we talk about them, the better. Those poor children were raised in a dungeon cell.</p><p><br></p><p>The only one who has any semblance of training is Ingvild and she is not up to date with the current situation either. So, all in all, my peerage members need serious education.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I might need a teacher for them. Each one of them has serious issues and needs help.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Is it something serious?\" She asked a little concerned.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Nothing too serious. They have just had troubled childhoods. Two of them are Dhamphirs who were raised in a dungeon cellar. They are really good people though but they are mostly ignorant about the world in general. I am teaching them the basics first before I go into anything else. On that matter, you all haven't visited much for the last few months.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Like Master, like subordinate.\" Latia smirked and I roughed her hair making her bristle.</p><p><br></p><p>We have gotten quite close in the last one and a half years. It started with her asking me about her dragon and how to take care of it and then just the general information about my farm. Her parents brought her over most of the time and she enjoyed playing in the farm.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I was mostly in the Human World for a few months to set up a business and Latia was travelling with me.\"</p><p><br></p><p>We talked a bit and finally it was time to present the gifts to the birthday girl.</p><p><br></p><p>Armin presented her with the same gift he gave Latia. Dammit. I wish I could have done it too.</p><p><br></p><p>Latia presented her gift, an ornamental hairpin.</p><p><br></p><p>It was again my turn and I presented Rias with the box wrapped by my peerage members.</p><p><br></p><p>She took it with a smile and opened it.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Venelana Gremory -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She saw her daughter accepting the gifts and remembered that it is her formal entry into the hellhole known as the Underworld's Politics.</p><p><br></p><p>Most of the devil's of her generation were either friendly with her, mainly the girls or were too immature, the boys. There were some who were different, her nephew, Sairaorg.</p><p><br></p><p>She had noticed the change in the boy just a few months after he ran away from home. Also, to think he would run to the infamous Buné of all people.</p><p><br></p><p>Then she remembered the conversation between the two back at Latia's birthday party and understood the reason. The young Buné Heir was the only one who didn't shun him, when he had started to shun himself too. The boy had given him hope when nothing was going in his favour and he had latched on to it.</p><p><br></p><p>She knew how disgusting the insides of the Bael Clan can be and how much of an insecure little shit her half-brother, the current Lord Bael is. She had experienced it herself as being more talented but the daughter of a concubine instead of the wife. It was the reason why she had maintained only formal relations with the Bael House.</p><p><br></p><p>But still, to think her nephew would run to a teenager instead of her in times of trouble. It did make her feel guilty about the situation. It was for this reason that she covered for Sairaorg.</p><p><br></p><p>The other one was the normally shy and soft-spoken heir of the Glasya-Labolas, who seemed like he had grown up a lot since she last saw him. He seemed a lot more… relaxed than before, which was a good thing for him. While the boy was unaware of it, he had a very significant fan-following in the underworld. He would be a lot more famous if only he opened up a bit more.</p><p><br></p><p>And finally, the one who was at the centre of it all, the infamous Farmer Noble, Mathias Buné who looked like he wanted nothing more than to get rid of his necktie but was only holding back due to Leila's glare. She found the child truly refreshing in this place where everyone does something to push an agenda of their own, he didn’t care about wealth or power.</p><p><br></p><p>She had talked to Sairaorg and he couldn’t stop gushing about his ‘Big Brother’. Their talks had given her a good idea about the boy and she liked it quite a lot. Now… if only it was just that.</p><p><br></p><p>Her son was a terrible liar… at least to his family, even more to her who had raised him since he needed someone to change his diapers. He was hiding something about the Buné Heir, something so important that he would lie to his family about it and judging by the way he was supporting the boy it didn’t seem to be a bad thing, just something that needed to be hidden.</p><p><br></p><p>Leila’s attitude and the hints she could get about her trying to pair him with her own daughter is very telling too.</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t call him out for it because it was a part of his Satan job but it did clue out on something else. The Buné Heir, Mathias Buné was special in some good ways and it was not just his friendly nature. She couldn’t ask Sirzechs about it and her own student Leila, would never slip like her son, so the only thing she could do to satiate her curiosity was to take a look by herself.</p><p><br></p><p>And it was now Rias’ turn to open the same boy’s gift.</p><p><br></p><p>The ornate box looked well-made. She opened the box and suddenly the entire hall was covered in a sweet scent of Vanilla so strong that even she felt her mouth salivate. She looked at the boy and he looked stunned for a moment as he looked at Armin Glasya-Labolas who looked just as stunned.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias lifted the content of the box and it was the most incredible type of fruit she had ever seen.</p><p><br></p><p>A Pink Heart shaped fruit the size of an adult’s head.</p><p><br></p><p>The scent became even more prominent and she couldn’t help but go forward. She looked in the box to check if there was something in the box giving out the smell but soon realised that it was coming from the fruit. Although, it did seem that there was something else in the box. “Rias, remove the velvet cover in the box.”</p><p><br></p><p>Rias seemed to have been broken out of her daze and did as she was told and the entire vicinity gasped. Inside it were five fruits placed in what seemed like oval diamond goblets.</p><p><br></p><p>The love of diamonds was not restricted to human females. Even devils were fond of the diamonds just as much if not even more due to their sins.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias however was more concentrated on the fruit in her hand and placed the box aside to take a bite of the fruit when a voice interfered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you think that’s a good idea, Heiress Gremory? That fruit looks awfully suspicious. Who knows what it has?”</p><p><br></p><p>The speaker was… Diodora Astaroth and she saw Leila and Ajuka both narrow their eyes and to her surprise even little Latia was the same.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias got a moment of scowl on her face but collected herself and replied calmly. “It’s fine. I trust Mathias…. Heir Buné.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You shouldn’t trust people so easily. You are the sibling of a Satan. I don’t think I should say this but, I being in the same position feel like you should take more care of whom you trust so easily. Some people try to shoot way above their leagues and won’t be resistant to using some… questionable means. I mean a small taste-test won’t hurt anyone and even you will be relieved in your heart.”</p><p><br></p><p>The people in the hall started murmuring and by now she could feel a few people even throwing suspicious looks at the Buné.</p><p><br></p><p>As for the boy himself, he had an emotionless look on his face as he looked at the Astaroth. It was understandable. This was a direct insult that many adults would be enraged about, and calm the boy may be, he was still a teenager. And sure enough he spoke , “Heir Astaroth.”</p><p><br></p><p>The hall quieted down as they watched the drama unfold.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes? Do you have anything to say, Heir Buné. Please don’t misunderstand me. I was not pointing to you in general. It was just a general suggestion. I hope you didn’t mind.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ah… a good tactic. This boy learned a bit since the last time she had seen him. Now, how would you reply to this, Mathias?</p><p><br></p><p>The Buné Heir however looked unphased by the comment and maintained the same look on his face before continuing. “You are drooling.”</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>She was sure she had seen a few people do spit-takes at the reply because she would have done the same thing and then she saw his stoic face change into a smile and the stunned Astaroth suddenly realised the situation and wiped his mouth… And that was it.</p><p><br></p><p>“You know, Heir Astaroth. If you wanted one of the fruits, you could have just told me. Pulling all this drama just to get a slice of it… is a little cheap to do. I mean I have seen you sneaking that last piece of cake from the dining table more than once during my visits to the Astaroth castle but. You shouldn’t do this in such public gatherings. After all, you are the cousin of a Satan. You should keep a minimum level of etiquette to present an example for others. This… I am sorry to say but this behaviour is a bit, hmm what’s that word… ah , yes, unbecoming of you.”</p><p><br></p><p>The red-faced and spluttering Astaroth didn’t get a chance to put forward a reply at all as he was drowned by the chuckles of the rest of the crowd.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah, nice diversion.” The one to speak this time was Zephyrdor Glasya-Labolas and her eyes inevitably went towards the Glasya-Labolas Heir who looked like he would tear a hole through his cousin with the glare he was throwing at him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Zephyrdos….<em>behave</em>.” He spoke in an even tone but the message was clear and the younger of the boys shut his jaw when he realised the glare. The Glasya-Labolas Heir wasn’t done however. He bowed towards everyone before continuing, “I apologise to everyone about my cousin’s behaviour. As for the taste-test. I will not deny that while mildly insulting, it can be said to be a valid concern in case there is not enough trust between the two parties….”</p><p><br></p><p>She had to raise an eyebrow at the boy’s words because she knew how close he was with the Buné Heir.</p><p><br></p><p> “So…. let me be the one to do it. I will not deny that there is some selfishness involved in my offer. The fruit that Heiress Gremory is holding in her hand is named by my close friend, Mathias, as the ‘Vanilove Fruit’ for Vanilla lovers. The previous Lord Buné, Mathias’ father, brought the seeds of these plants from the Pits, as we already know that the Pit number eight is under the care of the Buné House. The speciality of this plant is that the tree takes two years to grow and another three years to bear fruit after which it withers away completely. All in the meantime, each tree only yields a single fruit and it’s a delicacy rarely tasted by even royalty. I only found out about it from some old documents in my family’s library. The last one was gifted by my own ancestor to Satan Leviathan and hadn’t been seen since then. She had described it as the most delicious thing she had ever tasted. I could only identify the fruit because of its description because not even a picture of the fruit was left. There are twenty of these fruits, well nineteen now and is extremely beneficial to someone with a Demonic Beast heritage, as we all already know Satan Leviathan had and was called the Sea Serpent of the End. Unfortunately, no matter how much my ancestor searched for it, he couldn’t find another one and we never figured out a way to grow more of them. So, if Heiress Gremory is willing to do a taste-test for this, I would offer my assistance.”</p><p><br></p><p>She was pretty sure she had her mouth open at the reveal and so did many others who were now looking at the same fruit they were mocking with envious eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias too stared at the fruit in her hand in amazement before clutching it close to her chest. “It is fine, Heir Glasya-Labolas but, I trust Heir Buné. We have been friends for the last four years and I have eaten things from his farm more times than I can count. I am pretty sure that if he wanted to do something, he would have used those chances instead of being in front of everyone here. I think this particular bit of information was missed by Heir Astaroth. Be that as it may, I apologise for denying your request.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, it’s quite understandable Heiress Gremory.” Armin Glasya-Labolas smiled while Rias thanked the Buné Heir with a proper bow. She saw Leila taking him away with her and knew it was because other nobles were looking at the poor boy with hawk-like gazes.</p><p><br></p><p>She however looked back at the other gifts which were forgotten in the drama of the fruit.</p><p><br></p><p>Fruits encased in diamonds.</p><p><br></p><p>Was this a proposal from the Buné Heir?</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Mathias -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“You should totally be a writer, Armin. How did you even think of such a story on the fly?” I asked, amazed at the bullshit he had just spewed in front of everyone.</p><p><br></p><p>“I had thought of something beforehand in case you messed up… and you did. That was not a Rainbow Fruit, but I take it from your reaction that you didn’t know that either.” He asked instead of replying to my question.</p><p><br></p><p>“I didn’t, although I might know how it got changed or rather who changed the fruits.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Valerie?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Most probably. So, what was it about the fruit?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I did read about a fruit like that in one of the notes. Some of the details were exactly as I had said but everything else was different. Even if they find the record, they wouldn’t be able to tell anything because the details of the plants are known only by you. Anyways, do you realise the amount of misunderstanding it might cause?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t think he realises any of that.” My teacher took this opportunity to enter the conversation.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked back and saw her with Latia who was pouting at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Armin was very clever to put down any chances of other nobles hounding you for the fruits in the future but you should be careful about what you reveal in the future, at least till you come of age.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will pay attention to it.”</p><p><br></p><p>It was at this moment that Latia tugged at my sleeve, “I want one too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I want one of those too.” She pouted.</p><p><br></p><p>I couldn’t help but smile at her. It was probably the first time she asked me for something.</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay. You are welcome to come to my farm and I will arrange an entire feast for you.” I ruffled her hair and she nodded with a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! Can I join you two too?” Another voice was heard and I turned my head to see a pink clad Serafall Leviathan joining the private meeting followed by a silver haired man.</p><p><br></p><p>“Serafall. Euclid.” My teacher nodded at her while the rest of us bowed slightly.</p><p><br></p><p>“That was a very cute gift, Mathias. I can guess the story behind the fruit, the real one, still it was a good save, Armin. Anyways, I guess this is my first time meeting you so let me introduce myself. I am Magical Girl Levia-tan.” She spun around with a wand that she had summoned from somewhere and sparkles flew around in the place.</p><p><br></p><p>I for one was frozen in place and then I burst out in a laugh. “That was quite cool.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Heh, it was, wasn’t it?” She appeared in front of my face with sparkling eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Please don’t encourage her. I am the one who has to bear it afterwards.” The man, Euclid sighed but there was a smile on his face too. “Hello, my name is Euclid Lucifuge. I have heard a lot about you and it’s nice to finally meet you. I wonder if you would be interested in some talks in your freetime?” He offered me a hand and I shook it.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nice to meet you too. And sure, anything. I mean apart from my farmwork, I am quite free.”</p><p><br></p><p>The statement caused Serafall and Euclid to smile before the man explained. “I had heard about your… attachment with your farm and it seems to be quite true.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Attachment is a very mild word. Call it what it is, an obsession.” Leila rolled her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“I prefer calling it ‘my way of life’, but whatever fits your bill.” I pouted.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahah true. My wife calls my attachment to my lab the same.” Euclid laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Because it is. Sometimes I think you are the Vice President and Ajuka the President of the Devil’s Scientific Research and Development Department only because you give some time to your wife while Ajuka is married to his lab alone.” Leila snipped, making the man scratch his head looking mildly embarrassed.</p><p><br></p><p>I on the other hand was comparing this friendly and humble guy with the one from my knowledge of the Light Novels. It was like two different worlds entirely.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, what was it with the fruit? You looked a bit surprised when the gift was opened.” Serafall asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Obviously she would be able to see through it.</p><p><br></p><p>“My peerage members were packing the gift and made a mistake.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So, you were planning to give something else, not this and the diamond fruits?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“What diamond fruit?” Leila asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, you were not standing close to Rias so you didn’t see. There were five fruits encased in diamond-like goblets. They might be crystals though, now that I think about their size, but they looked extremely beautiful.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, they are called Diamond Figcrystals. Those were one hundred percent diamonds, I assure you. But no, those were there so that people don’t mock the gift as a bunch of fruits. It was the other fruit that was different. I was planning to give Rias a Rainbow Fruit, which is slightly better than this one. They look like rainbow coloured peaches and take a long time to mature.”</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>“Mathias, you will be returning back for lessons. I think I need to teach you about economics in the underworld so that you don’t accidentally crash it somehow.” Leila said while massaging her head.</p><p><br></p><p>Leila had put up a barrier when she had come here so our discussions were safe.</p><p><br></p><p>“So the diamonds grow on trees naturally?” Euclid asked me and I nodded. “Fascinating. I wonder how that happens?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well… at the core of it all, diamond is also carbon which is the main part of all organic molecules. It’s just a variation of the crystal structure, so it’s not completely out of understanding that some plants can manipulate carbon and change its crystalline structure. Although, my diamonds shine brightly when heat  is applied on them, still…. I mean entire living beings can be born from a single cell. What is this compared to that kind of a miracle?” The real miracle is the miracle of life.</p><p><br></p><p>“So true. Are you interested in science?” He asked me with shining eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have read some things.” Basically my Bachelor's Degree from my previous life. “I have to read a lot about biology to learn more about life. It helps with my work.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You wouldn’t realise it with his brutish looks but this guy is quite knowledgeable when it comes to books.” Armin commented, making me pout slightly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sissy.” I whispered under my breath which was still loud enough to be heard by everyone.</p><p><br></p><p>As for me being knowledgeable, obviously I am. I was preparing for my Masters when I died and was transmigrated. Basically four years ago.</p><p><br></p><p>“My research is also dealing with life and cell manipulation. I won’t bore you with the delatils now or Serafall will freeze me into a popsicle but let’s find some time after today. I believe we can help each other in this regard.” He smiled while looking at Serafall and I nodded back.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes yes, no boring us with the stuffy science stuff.” Serafall protested, waving her arms around. “Tell me more about the other fruit, that Rainbow one. Do you still have those? I actually wanted to buy some things from you to serve at my So-tan’s birthday party soon. Can you offer any suggestions?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Food for the birthday? Hmm, you can come to my farm and select the things you like. I can explain things but I don’t think it would be as good as showing them personally. Mr. Lucifuge, you are welcome too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, just call me Euclid.” He smiled back.</p><p><br></p><p>“Really! Thank you Matty-kun. You are such a sweetie. Know what, if anyone bothers you for the love-love fruit thing, just tell them that you sold every last one of them to me. I will take care of it.” She ruffled my hair and said with a smile. Although her, lifting her hand above her own head to ruffle my hair did look a bit funny.</p><p><br></p><p>We talked for a while after that and returned to the party.</p><p><br></p><p>As expected I got surrounded by requests for the fruits. Some even tried to bid on it but stopped when I used my Serafall Card.</p><p><br></p><p>I got to see Sirzechs’ son, Millicas Gremory who looked like a ball of cuteness, especially when followed by his little dog, which I had made. I wonder what he would do if he found that I had made it look like the miniature version of Beast Four(without powers, obviously). Then again, who doesn’t love Fou. It’s an adorable fluff-ball who can kill the entire Human Race if left out.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, I met Rias and her mother. She thanked me for the fruit, which she had locked away after everyone was eying it covetously since Armin’s reveal. She thanked me for the gift and I suggested feeding some of it to her bunny. At least the figs.</p><p><br></p><p>I also found out on this day that Venelana Gremory was my teacher’s teacher. We talked about various topics and she liked listening to me talk about my farm. She liked playing the piano and had even tutored Sirzechs in it. I think I had heard that the guy wanted to become a musician before, and now I know why.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias on the other hand didn’t have the patience for learning the piano. Also, in her defence, there weren’t so many means of entertainment five hundred years ago.</p><p><br></p><p>Apparently the old satan descendants, or at least most of them, abhorred human stuff and looked down on anyone using them. Not that there were many interesting things back then. Compared to today, that era was certainly lacking.</p><p><br></p><p>The rest of the party ended on a good note overall.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Great Red -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the being in front of him, training endlessly to hone its skills, to further its power by just a bit, with each passing day, trying to inch forward to the next level bit by bit.</p><p><br></p><p>Dragons were proud creatures. Training was not something any of them did. They grew through fights. Any of them who did train, did so because they were driven by something. Like Tiamat was driven by the goal to chase after her mother.</p><p><br></p><p>This one however was different.</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t train because he was driven by something. He trained to find something to drive him further. However, dragons of his strength were either dead or sealed….or in the recent case, unknown to him.</p><p><br></p><p>Tiamat still needed the push to stabilise her power. A place to let it all out in a fight and this guy was looking for such a fight. If this wasn’t calling for a helping hand, he didn’t know what was.</p><p><br></p><p>And maybe….just maybe, even his new friend could get something out of it.</p><p><br></p><p>After all, Crom Crauch was looking for the future path of the Dragon Race.</p><p><br></p><p>Mathias Buné, might very well be such a future.</p><p><br></p><p>He was just lending them a helping hand….like the friendly neighbourhood, True Dragon.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Zeoticus Gremory -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He sat with his dear wife when Sirzechs entered the room.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mother, Father. You called for me?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Take a seat first.” His wife ordered.</p><p><br></p><p>He took the seat and Venelana set up a barrier around the room.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs became serious at this measure of precaution.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is this about?” He asked while they waited until the barrier was set.</p><p><br></p><p>“First of all let me make something clear to you. If you cannot speak about anything as a Satan, we are not going to force you to. We know our bounds and respect your privacy.” Venelana started off.</p><p><br></p><p>“What are you talking about, Mother?” Sirzechs asked seriously this time.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mathias Buné.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What about Mathias, Mother?” He asked, looking confused. Venelana was however not in a mood of these diversions, considering the topic they had to discuss.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sirzechs. I am your Mother. I have raised you since you wet your bed. Do you think I wouldn’t know when you lie or hide things? Your left eyebrow twitched just now. What are you hiding?”</p><p><br></p><p>He watched Sirzechs’ eyes widen slightly before he realised his mistake and corrected it. Oh, he was still young. Venelana had mastered the art of reading people she knew like a book long ago. Even he had suffered from it….several times.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sirzechs, again. If you cannot speak. We will not force you but….this is important.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What is this about, Father?”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at Venelana who nodded and he continued, “We are considering future prospects for Rias’ husband. I was going to talk to Lord Phenex who had shown interest in marrying his youngest son, Riser into the Gremory family but….today’s birthday party and Rias’ own reactions made us reconsider some decisions.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs’ mouth opened slightly as he processed the information.</p><p><br></p><p>“And you are considering Mathias? But he is going to be the Lord of his house and Rias is the Heiress….”</p><p><br></p><p>“The Gremory House doesn’t lack people, Sirzechs. We still have Millicas or any other children you may have in the future. I am still alive. Mother is alive and so are many others. A few years is nothing but a marriage will last a lifetime….and we devils have a very long lifetime. I don’t want to make a decision because once things are finalised, things become difficult to change. Not to mention, there is the risk of offending the other party. If Rias gets a better life as the Lady of a different house, I would not deny her of it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Is this because of the gift? The fruit was good but to go so far just for that....”</p><p><br></p><p>“It was for the fruit, yes, but not for the one you might be talking about. It’s about the other five fruits. They were encased in Diamonds. Pure natural diamond. I had Henriech test them. Do you know how much their estimated value is?” He looked at the blank look on his son’s face and continued. “A billion Liliums. One Billion Liliums. That’s a quarter of the entire Gremory Family’s yearly turnover and he gave it just like that. I might not have met the boy, but from what your mother tells me, he is not a fool. So, why would the Buné House, someone that is known for its poverty in the past few centuries, give such a gift. Or rather, <em>how</em> would they give such a gift?” He asked, making Sirzechs shut his mouth again.</p><p><br></p><p>“Also, you might not have noticed it but, your little sister has developed somewhat of a crush on him due to the ‘Vanilove Fruit’. We did check her and the fruit, just in case, and it wasn’t anything magical. If we tried to engage her to someone despite this, without even considering her wish, it would be incredibly cruel to her. So, if I am going to consider Mathias Buné for a choice, I need to know of everything I possibly can. I know for certain that he is not a bad sort of boy with my interaction with him. Leila wouldn’t be trying to push her daughter to him if that were the case.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You know that!” Sirzechs called out and he smirked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Please son. I have taught you both and while Leila is certainly better at being subtle, she isn’t untraceable. Leila wouldn’t match her daughter with someone who wasn’t a good enough match in every way possible. Her standards are way higher than normal Devil’s and I, being her teacher, approve of her choice.” Venelana replied in a bored tone.</p><p><br></p><p>“If you know that, then why would you….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ask to get Rias married?” Venelana sighed. “Just because you don’t have a harem, doesn’t mean it’s not common. Your father has one and we are still happily married. Some of them are even my close friends. Several devils have multiple marriages and are happy with it. We will leave such a choice to the ones concerned. It is their lives. So, tell us about Mathias Buné.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs sighed deeply and then looked up. “Am I really that bad at lying?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Only to family, my dear.” Venelana consoled softly.</p><p><br></p><p>“If it makes you feel any better, I always get caught too.” He did his part too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. The other three are going to chew me out because of this, especially considering how much we did to keep him and his work hidden all this time. Most of it was my work though. So, if we are talking about this, it stays here. Mathias Buné, in my and other three Satan’s honest and humble opinions, is someone who can and will change the underworld and we….as a race, will lose a lot if something happens to him before he can reach his full potential.” The tone of his voice and the last words did make them raise their eyebrows.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hiding him from whom? Inside or outside?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Both.” Sirzechs sighed. “To tell you the truth, I had considered you as a potential teacher for Mathias, when I met him the first time. I had to shift to Lady Sitri and Leila later on because of our house having a connection with Zekram and the Great King faction. Thus, the only choices we had were Lady Sitri and Leila of which we chose Leila later on because….we needed someone who could do a complete and thorough psych test for Mathias. His powers, we just couldn’t afford someone like him to be against the underworld and the situations I had encountered him in, made me take this action. Ah, but I am getting ahead of myself. I should have started with the basics first. Mathias’ full name is Mathias Buné… Zagan, the current Lord of both Buné and Zagan houses.”</p><p><br></p><p>Zagan!</p><p><br></p><p>His mind raced and he recalled the details of the Zagan House and his eyes widened as he understood the implication of the name. “Did he?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. he inherited both the Clan Traits.” Sirzechs answered his question.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh Satan!”</p><p><br></p><p>Venelana seemed to have reached the same conclusion but still said. “Explain.”</p><p><br></p><p>And Sirzechs did explain things.</p><p><br></p><p>The meeting, the scandal, the boy surviving in the wild alone since then and everything about him from the very start.</p><p><br></p><p>“I can understand why you hid the information and are still hiding it now. If he had been discovered, he would have either been brainwashed by the Great King faction into their puppet or encountered an ‘accident’ somewhere. For them, only the underworld they control is worthy of existing. Knowing the boy’s personality, the accident seems like the most likely end. Not to mention, the other factions would become tense once more. It was a story I had heard from Mother once but apparently father had mumbled it out once when drunk. In the Great War, Archangel Uriel had once faced against Zekram and his legions in battle and Zekram had asked him if he was there to take him down in a suicidal misson too. Archangel Uriel had just laughed and replied and I quote, ‘You are not worthy.’ He then proceeded to burn the entire legion to ashes with his famed Holy Flames. Probably burned a healthy amount of pride with it too. The scarier thing is that Archangel Saraqael was stronger than Archangel Uriel. The other factions will certainly target him.”</p><p><br></p><p>“How strong is he?” After all, it wouldn’t do if his daughter became a widow, soon after marriage. Thinking of this, he asked Sirzechs, making his son sigh again.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mathias, although not confirmed accurately, is at the very least an Ultimate Class in terms of strength.”</p><p><br></p><p>“How old is he again?” Venelana asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sixteen in two weeks.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Is he like….” He tried asking but Sirzechs shook his head.</p><p><br></p><p>“We don’t know. From what we know and guess, Mathias’ Zagan Trait is a mutation because there are no such records of King Zagan using these, but then again, it could also be him hiding things like all the other houses. We don’t have any solid information that would tell us and those who are in the know-how, cannot be contacted. The food created and grown by Mathias boosts certain aspects of living beings. Even Armin became an Ultimate Class after training with Mathias for a year. We have no idea about his exact power and are only guessing because Armin always spars with Mathias, so they should probably be around the same level of strength.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A sixteen year old Ultimate Class, potential Super Devil with two lordships and one of them being the Zagan. I can see why Leila would do such a thing.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It is also her husband’s decision because the Agares Trait can be used to age wine made from fruits from Mathias’ farm. He wishes to start those and has already started working for it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Indeed. Septus Agares is indeed a shrewd businessman.” That said, the business opportunities didn’t end just there. There was also the option of getting materials for different fibres and animal skins from the Farm to further the Gremory Family’s main textile business. Even a simple contract with such a House would be lucrative.</p><p><br></p><p>The Gremory Family’s business mainly dealt with Textiles and Clothing lines. They also expanded in the Hotel and Real Estate Sectors but the Textiles were still their main line of work in the Underworld and the Human World both. It accounted for the majority of the House’s annual turnover.</p><p><br></p><p>In a way, this was even better than a partnership with the Phenex House.</p><p><br></p><p>While the Phenex might have the largest amount of wealth among the families of the Underworld, the Buné had the highest earning potential. After all, food was something everyone required. That said, how would someone compete with a guy who can just grow gemstones? Not to mention, his strength <em>and</em> the power to make others strong too. Heaven and the Fallen Angels don’t have the capital to sacrifice an Archangel for a fight anymore. He was pretty sure that if he let this opportunity pass away, Mother would never let him hear the end of it. The opportunity was just that good and Rias liked him so he wouldn’t be forcing her either. A win-win situation if there ever was one.</p><p><br></p><p>“In that case, I wish to meet him more to know him a bit more and get Rias and him to know each other.” Venelana’s words broke his train of thoughts.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. We will be taking a tour of his farm for the first time because Serafall wanted to pick things up for Sona’s birthday. You all can join in too. But, even if you finalise the things, we cannot announce anything to the public until Mathias comes of age. You will have to wait for two more years for the announcement.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That part is quite understandable and goes without saying.” He looked at his wife and both of them nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>The future was certainly unexpected. He was planning to surprise the world with the engagement between the Gremory and Phenex Houses but the world threw an even greater surprise back at him.</p><p><br></p><p>A good and welcome surprise but a surprise nonetheless.</p><p>__________________________________x__________________________________________________________________x________________________________</p><p><strong>Beta Reader: LuluViBritania(FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Authors Note:</strong></p><p><strong>Another chapter of fresh goodness from the Farm.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>As we can see, Mathias is chilling out in his farm without a care about the rest of the world, while the entire world plots to bring Mathias’ out of his farm.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>In this chapter, I tried writing something about his friendship with Armin.

I will not be a minion for anyone. I don’t know why but just the notion of such a thing made me feel repulsed. It might have something to do with my Dragon Nature. Whatever it was, I knew that I would not become his minion. If there’s a fight for that and I get beaten to the pulp, then so be it.</p><p><br></p><p>It has been the same way since I was reborn. I was somehow aware that people would be out to kill me if my identity was revealed and thus I hid it. I still felt danger but… fear was a different thing. I didn’t feel a single bit of fear even when I was staring down Sirzechs’ when I first met him or when I first asked Tiamat to join my peerage. It was just this way and I guess I never really thought about it before this moment. Was this because I had experienced death once? Maybe, who knows?</p><p><br></p><p>He suddenly sighed out loud and sat back. “Well, I was hoping that worked. It would have been easier if it did. Your dragon blood is thicker than I expected. Whatever, it’s not like I didn’t expect this either.  Well, then how about a business proposition?”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at him and raised an eyebrow.</p><p><br></p><p>“Grow these Dragon Apples for me. The stronger the variety, the better. If you have something that’s good for Dragons especially, throw those in too.In return I will pay you with something good once in a while.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s pretty vague, you know.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am a Dragon, not a businessman who knows how to haggle. Whatever I bring, will be worth it for you. Also, know what… I’ll throw in a surprise gift too. This is my deal. Take it or leave it.” He stared at me.</p><p><br></p><p>At times like this I wished I had learned Senjutsu from somewhere. Then again, I doubt Senjutsu would be useful against him.</p><p><br></p><p>“One favour. I want one favour outside of whatever you want. I know the levels to which my crops can grow and I know that even you have some idea about it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“As long as it’s not too much, I can agree.” He thought for a second and replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“We have a deal then.” I agreed too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Deal.” He replied back.</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>“I feel like I did something very ridiculous just now but I somehow don’t realize it yet.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah, it will come to you soon enough.” He dawdled as he brought a plate in front of me with another heap of Dragon Apples and started gulping them one by one..</p><p><br></p><p>“So, what was that about becoming your minion?” I asked as I picked up an apple for myself.</p><p><br></p><p>“I was thinking about taking you as a minion. I have your back and in return you produce the apples for me. You know, like the Yakuza thing. Would have saved me trying to find something for you every time.” He replied from between his bites.</p><p><br></p><p>“So you were basically trying to shrug off work?”</p><p><br></p><p>He shrugged his shoulders. “Had to try it at least. I had to see through many movies to learn about negotiations. You would be surprised to know that this is the first one I have been in.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Really?” I asked, actually surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>“Being the strongest being in this world basically gets me what I want just by putting my hand on it which is rarely anything. I don’t think anyone except those guys from the Hindu Pantheon or Ophis would even dare to deny it. But then again, Ophis is a child who doesn’t even understand what she wants and I never had any altercations with the Hindu Pantheon.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The Hindu Pantheon is that strong?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The Trimurti are some of the oldest Gods who still exist with all of their power intact. Primordials like them from other Pantheons have decayed or downright disappeared after not being able to hold on. When someone lives that long, they obviously are not exactly normal. Moreover, they have their trump cards too. People talk about the Trimurti but no one talks about their wives. Do you think three beings like those three would have normal wives? Primordials like Izanagi, Tiamat, Gaia in their prime would give you an idea about how dangerous those women can be. Sure, I could take them all on my own, but… I will have to use too much effort and I will not escape unscathed either. It would be a pyrrhic victory at best. It’s not really worth that much trouble, not to mention the world would probably be a heap of ashes by the time the fight is over.” He spoke while continuing his work on the apples.</p><p><br></p><p>“I knew those guys were strong but still… that’s insane!” I exclaimed.</p><p><br></p><p>“What do you expect? They are basically the only faction with little to no infighting. Other factions were more or less born and gained power by killing their parents. The Greeks were like that. The Shinto ruined by infighting.The Egyptians were similar. The Norse were somewhat sane due to Odin keeping things on a tight leash but even they have Loki. The Abrhamic factions had Lucifer and the Fallen Angels. Even a Dragon Goddess like Tiamat was killed and had her powers taken by her children while her womb was sealed by Yahweh inside the Annihilation Maker.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Wait what! The Annihilation Maker has Tiamat’s womb?” I asked incredulously as I realized that the guy in front of me had been present as the history in this world was made. He would know things that are only myths for others. Even just the knowledge from him would be worth more for many people than all the gold in this world.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh yeah. Tiamat was called the ‘Mud of Creation’. She gave birth to monsters. Does it sound similar to anything? Yahweh collected her womb sealed by the Mesopamian Gods after Azazel had burned Babylon and made it into one of his trinkets later. After her death, I had collected the leftover energy from her and shaped it into a hatchling in hopes that it would grow to the heights of her predecessor one day. You are welcome.” He said the last part with a smirk to me.</p><p><br></p><p>Of course he knew about Tiamat and my relationship.</p><p><br></p><p>“Anyways, after the Primordials of the Factions became weakened or were killed, they fought amongst themselves and even with other factions, causing severe casualties among them. The poor Aztecs and American Pantheons were hunted down and their powers usurped by other pantheons. The humans more or less stopped believing in them didn’t help either. Also, Gods rarely ever train to become stronger. But hey, who am I to say anything about that? The Hindu Pantheon survived all that due to their main three Gods standing like a firm wall against any such thing and thus their current strength.” He explained the story in detail further and I listened to it in rapt attention. The story of how Izanami was locked in a cave to Yomi by her husband or how Ouranos was neutered or when Prometheus gave fire to humans.</p><p><br></p><p>We talked a lot about things that I had no idea even existed.</p><p><br></p><p>How the Top Ten Strongest Beings list that people knew was just a joke and a far cry from the real list. He did point out that there were no females on that list which was suspicious in itself. It was more of what was out for the people to see. Some places had more than one being tied for a position and some just didn’t appear on the list at all.</p><p><br></p><p>He finally collected half of the Dragon Apples in the farm.</p><p><br></p><p>\"This will last me for a while. Now for your surprise gift.\"</p><p><br></p><p>He cut his finger and blood seeped from the cut and turned into a mist rushing towards me and entering my body.</p><p><br></p><p>And then I felt it. Pain… pain as if my blood was being boiled, my bones being broken down and reshaped. I fell to my knees and clutched my chest.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Ah, I should have thought about it. This is the first time I have done something like this. Don't worry, the pain will go away soon and you will thank me later. Okay, see you later then. Live well.\"</p><p><br></p><p>All I could do in reply was shout as my body turned into my dragon form and I became unconscious.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>__________________________________________________________________________</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I woke up and found myself on a patch of charred land. The fire must have been hot because the soil had glazed over as glass had formed on the top.</p><p><br></p><p>I was completely naked. And suddenly I remembered why I was there. I looked at my body, checking if something was wrong with me.</p><p><br></p><p>I found no harm and quickly checked my Status. The results were… . </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Host: Mathias Buné</strong></p><p><strong>Title: The Poor Noble, Pure Blooded Devil, The Farmer</strong></p><p><strong>Age: 14 years old. </strong></p><p><strong>Body: B[C+]</strong></p><p><strong>Mind: B[C+]</strong></p><p><strong>Spirit: B[C+]</strong></p><p><strong>Magic: B[C+]</strong></p><p><strong>Luck: C+</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Skills:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Buné Clan Trait:</strong></p><p><strong>Dragon Taming: B[C+]</strong></p><p><strong>Dragonification: B[C+]</strong></p><p><strong>Dragonfire: B[C+]</strong></p><p><strong>Dragon's Aura: B[C+]</strong></p><p><strong>Dream Manipulation: E+</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Zagan Clan Trait:</strong></p><p><strong>Life Magic: C+</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Magic:</strong></p><p><strong>Teleportation: C+</strong></p><p><strong>Bounded Field Creation: C+</strong></p><p><strong>Memory Alteration: C-</strong></p><p><strong>Barrier Magic: C</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Martial Arts: C+</strong></p><p><strong>Touki: B+[C+]</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Abnormality Resistance: B[C+]</strong></p><p><br><br></p><p><strong>Farm Management</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Farm Rank: C</strong></p><p><strong>Farming Points: 520,076.</strong></p><p><strong>Money: 14,488,000Ⱡ</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Shop</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Inventory</strong></p><p><br></p><p>… Wow.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly all the urge I had to curse at the annoying dragon vanished as I looked at the change in my stats.</p><p><br></p><p>This increase is freaking insane.</p><p><br></p><p>It kinda sucks that my Farm Rank is capping my strength. Still, I feel much stronger than before. Several of my Stats have actually jumped into the Satan Class and some have even entered into the B+ Rank. The new Skills are super useful too.</p><p><br></p><p>Abnormality Resistance is almost always helpful and Dream Manipulation is something that I still need to explore.</p><p><br></p><p>I noticed the table he had made last night still being present and found two things there.</p><p><br></p><p>First, the plate where he was eating apples and second was a letter right under it.</p><p><br></p><p>I opened the letter and it basically stated that he used a method that would increase my Dragon Aspect rather than increasing my Dragon Blood. It was done so that I don't become a Dragon-Devil Hybrid. It's quite similar to Ophis' snakes but this one used his blood and thus was permanent.</p><p><br></p><p>This made it painful.</p><p><br></p><p>The area was surrounded by a mist-like barrier which prevented the nearby farm and trees from being harmed.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy was at least this thoughtful.</p><p><br></p><p>I walked out from the place and the mist dispersed and so did the table and other furniture made by him behind me.</p><p><br></p><p>I still needed to check all the changes personally and experience it for myself.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>__________________________________________________________________________</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Looking at myself in the mirror, I looked at my now sharper features. My hair was slightly redder and the golden colour of my eyes was even more pronounced with a shine to it.</p><p><br></p><p>I think I grew a few centimetres in height too.</p><p><br></p><p>The biggest change was in my Dragon form which had undergone a massive change. I could already change into my complete Dragon form by the time I was D Ranked in my Dragonification Skill. The increased Ranks just increased the power of my Dragon Form with every level.</p><p><br></p><p>This time though the change was a lot more in terms of how I looked. From being a dragon that walked on all fours, I became a bipedal type of Dragon. Some of the protective scales on my joints and important parts had changed into plates of  golden colour and even spikes with my scales looked much shinier and redder looking.</p><p><br></p><p>As for the power behind my attacks. The potency of the attacks were a lot better than before. My Dragonfire especially was stronger than before to a frankly insane degree. I didn't get to test out the full extent of it because a peak Ultimate Class Dragon going on a rampage is extremely destructive. I don't think my farm would be able to take it, so I controlled myself somehow.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, what happened to you? You look somewhat different today.” Tiamat asked me, staring at me suspiciously.</p><p><br></p><p>“I think I hit puberty. Dragon Puberty maybe. Hits just as hard as normal ones, I tell ya.” I joked and she rolled her eyes but didn’t push.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tia.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I might have found some information about….your mother.”</p><p><br></p><p>Her hand stopped as she looked at me with no expression on her face. I continued. “She… Her womb is sealed inside the Annihilation Maker. I don’t know if you knew this or not but I thought I should tell you in case you didn’t know. Sorry to bring back bad memories.”</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t reply for a few moments but then answered after sighing a little. “I don’t have any bad memories. I don’t have any memories about her. I will try to see if I can find the next user of the Annihilation Maker and communicate with her leftover consciousness. Who told you about this? I don’t think the Annihilation Maker users have ever communicated with its spirit.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The annoying guy is my new customer. I don’t think I should reveal his name without his permission but he claimed to have collected the leftover energy of your mother to form a new <em>hatchling</em> to see if it could reach the heights that her mother had achieved. He wants me to grow Dragon Apples for him.”</p><p><br></p><p>It should be enough for her to figure out and know how much to speak about this to others.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked thoughtful for a moment and then her eyes widened and I think for the first time I saw Tiamat with such a wide-mouthed reaction.</p><p><br></p><p>She then stared at me grabbing me by my cheeks and stared deeply into my eyes, her nose barely an inch from my face. She smelled like Dragon Apples. It felt warm.</p><p><br></p><p>She was still looking at me closely and I was feeling a bit awkward so I spoke to break her out of her stupor. “You know, going to first base directly without even going on a date. I am quite fine with it. Still, the talk of Dragons being aggressive was all true.”</p><p><br></p><p>She realised the position she was in but instead of blushing or anything, she scoffed. “If I wanted to get to any bases, I would do so. I wouldn’t stop an inch from it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And I wouldn’t mind it either.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Says the brat who hit puberty today.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I guess it is a sign.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Still after me I see. And here I thought you lost interest in me after you stopped asking me to become your queen.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Why would I ever lose interest in you? As for that, you already told me the condition for it. I will follow it. No point in annoying you with my continuous requests anymore.”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at me and then her lips curved into a hint of a smile. “You are a hundred years too early to beat me, brat.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Aye, then I just have to work harder, I guess.”</p><p><br></p><p>“When you get time from your farming.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Farming is not just farming, Tia. This is an act that makes a normal man achieve feats of Gods. Creating life. Each farmer gives lives to their crops and helps sustain several others. It is not just Farming, it’s a way of living. This is what makes me… well me.”</p><p><br></p><p>She quieted down a bit. “Creating life, huh.”</p><p><br></p><p>She got lost in her thoughts and I left her to it. The reveal must have been a lot for her. She needed her time too.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the newly prepared and planted piece of land in front of my eyes. This should be enough to keep the Dragon satiated. The orchard covered an area of over eight hundred hectares and had only Dragon Apples. This much stock would rival Tannin’s produce in a few years. It took me two weeks to get this done even when I had transferred a lot of my workforce to this job.</p><p><br></p><p>Life’s weird.</p><p><br></p><p>Who would have thought that the first real customer I get in this world will be The Dragon of Dreams?</p><p><br></p><p>As for him knowing about me being a reincarnator. Well, what can I do about it? I mean there’s literally nothing I could do about it so why care? Just accept the situation and move on.</p><p><br></p><p>The only thing I can do is farm peacefully and become stronger. The fact that his request aligns with my normal work just makes it an even better deal.</p><p><br></p><p>“How do you keep doing this work all the time? Don’t you get bored?” My newest friend Armin asked me while looking at the stretch of land in front of us. He however was doing his own work, painting the scene of one of my dryads working on the plants. He likes painting and my farm is beautiful. It’s obvious that he would like it here.</p><p><br></p><p>“You have to try it to know. Why don’t you try it sometimes? It serves as good training.” I said putting down the shovel.</p><p><br></p><p>He took a few steps back and looked at the painting and then at the scene in front of him and nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tilling fields for hours straight? I would understand if you used magic but you don’t even do that. I agree this would be good for your body but how much would that carry you forward? Magic is one of the gifts of the Devil race. Aren’t you ignoring it?” He asked in a genuinely confused tone. The best thing I felt about him was that he was not condescending about anything, no matter how mundane or ordinary it seemed. It might be due to him being mocked before for having a simple thing like painting as a hobby and even wanting to make it a career choice.</p><p><br></p><p> I looked back at the soft spoken guy I was growing to be fond of as my first friend in this world. I guess I will break that misconception and share some of the goodness with him.</p><p><br></p><p>I picked up the shovel and raised it towards him. “Here, pick it up. Try shovelling just one hectare of land. You can use magic but you need to use this shovel. Go on, give it a good hard swing.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Why not just use magic to till the land? Why even use this shovel?” he asked but came forward nonetheless.</p><p><br></p><p>That changed as soon as he held the shovel and I let go of the handle. He fell down gripping the shovel, his hand buried in the dirt beneath us.</p><p><br></p><p>He tried to pick it up with brute strength but could barely make it shake, forcing him to use his demonic power to reinforce himself to pick up the shovel, only to drop it again after picking it up for a few moments.</p><p><br></p><p>“What kind of monstrosity is this! How much does this thing even weigh?” He asked looking at the shovel as if it was a joke and then he looked at my smiling face and pointed a finger at me. “Yeah, a joke. You are joking with me. How could it weigh so much? Is it gravity magic? That’s quite advanced I agree…”</p><p><br></p><p>“There are a bunch of tools in that box over there. Go and pick any one of them and see if this was a joke.”</p><p><br></p><p>He stopped the sentence and stared at me for a few moments and then without a word went up to the box to pick up the hoe… and could barely move it. He tried the same with other farm tools and got the same result every time. All the tools were of similar weight.</p><p><br></p><p>All my new tools were bought from the Farmer System. They are made to be nigh unbreakable and suitable for specific grades. The ones I am using are made for C Ranked beings. Each one of them weighs two tons.</p><p><br></p><p>I have to reinforce my muscles to use them for an extended period of time.</p><p><br></p><p>“Demonic Power is not suited for growing several crops. Especially in this land where the land is already saturated with Demonic Power.” I spoke when he finally stopped his tries and looked blankly at me. “This led me to use tools with bare hands when I started farming. But normal tools get degraded very quickly and the costs increase. So, I got these. They are extremely resistant to demonic power and very hardy. I used to use the lighter models. These weigh two tons a piece. I started with one hundred and twenty kilograms each and reached this level. When I get used to them, I upgrade to a new one. These require me to constantly use my Demonic Power to reinforce my muscles so that I don’t get tired easily. It’s a very good way to train my Demonic Power output and control. Your Barrier Magic works on a similar principle. I think this could help you too. So,” I summoned several boxes of tools. “Pick the one suitable for you and get working. Trust me, food tastes the best after getting exhausted from hard work. Who knows… maybe you will grow some muscles and stop looking like a sissy.” I teased.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy just looked at me and the tools for a few moments and then shook his head with a smile as he picked up one of the lighter ones and got to work on an empty patch of land.</p><p><br></p><p>“At least I don’t look like a brute.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hey, I look ruggedly handsome.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And I prefer being called… refined.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah, whatever goes for sissy in your language.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Says the brute.”</p><p><br></p><p>We bickered while working on the field. I was glad to have shown another person the true path.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- One Year Later -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>A year had passed since I roped Armin into working in the fields with me.</p><p><br></p><p>The year had gone by quite peacefully and I got two regular visitors to my farm now. Well, three if we count Tiamat.</p><p><br></p><p>The new visitor was the one who was chowing down on the veg burger in front of him as if this was his last meal of the year. Armin looked at the boy and chuckled as he picked up barbecued veggies and some cheese rabbit meat on his plate.</p><p><br></p><p>“You know, you look quite similar to him, the first few months after eating the food.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I most certainly did not. I just missed the food because I was not allowed to bring them to our home. My Elder brother made it plenty clear that the food was not to be taken back home. Not my favourite ones at least. I am just waiting for two years and four months to pass quickly so that you can come out and announce your identity and I can get my favourite dishes at home.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, you hurt me Armin. Are you not worried that people will come out to try and kill me as soon as the news is revealed?”</p><p><br></p><p>He made an innocent looking face, tilting his head slightly. “Why would I be worried for the attackers? They chose to attack a monster in a Devil’s skin on their own. Let them suffer their stupidity.”</p><p><br></p><p>I scoffed at his comment.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is there a monster in the area, Big Brother?” Sairaorg asked, looking up from his food and Armin smirked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. There’s a big bad red haired monster in this place. He’s strong, very strong. He eats any intruder who tries to harm this farm.” Armin wove the story for the extremely  innocent Sai and I merely shook my head.</p><p><br></p><p>Sai had started coming here soon after he got sent off to stay on the outskirts of the Bael territory. He actually flew the distance because he couldn’t teleport due to his lack of Demonic Power. He will be getting his peerage members to teleport him when he gets one but he hasn’t recruited anyone yet.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, he followed me around like a puppy and even joined Armin and me in our training, which was the great art of farming. This has been going on for an entire year already. The guy trains until he drops, eats and meditates and then trains again until he falls unconscious. One infuriating thing was that no one fucking cares where he goes or what he does since his mother had fallen caught the sleeping sickness. He goes back every week or so to check up on her but the rest of the time, he’s become more or less a resident of this place.</p><p><br></p><p>I informed Sirzechs about it and he talked it out with others a bit. Apparently Venelana is covering for him now and Mathers takes care of his transportation.</p><p><br></p><p>He actually encouraged me to help Sairaorg out a bit because the boy was almost alone in the Bael territory.</p><p><br></p><p>In this past year, I spent my time learning more new skills because my existing skills were already at the top.</p><p><br></p><p>The new skill from Great Red, Dream Manipulation was similar to an Illusion Skill. It starts with basic Illusions to high level shit like Tsukiyomi and such if I wanted to.</p><p><br></p><p>Tiamat asked me to keep that specific Skill as a last resort because of potential problems. Great Red can practically spam Izanagi without getting eye-pox on his arms. An Illusion over reality. That’s one of the things that makes him so annoyingly difficult to defeat. Well, only one of the things. There are obviously a number of other things too. Reality Bending being one of them. Overwhelming levels of power another</p><p><br></p><p>I am obviously not even close to it. To be honest, I’m not the sneaky Illusion type of guy. I am still trying to master it, because why not? I have time. I have the power. So why not?</p><p><br></p><p>I have learned Spatial Magic. It was basically to hide my Farm by creating different dimensions for my farm. I had to brute force it to be honest. I was not really good at it so I had to upgrade it using the Farming Points after getting it to the most basic level. I am just waiting for the next Farm upgrade before trying anything else.</p><p><br></p><p>It was just two months ago that I finally got enough points for the next upgrade.</p><p><br></p><p>It took around two and a half years for my farm to reach this level. Still the B Ranked Farm Upgrade was every bit worth it. It finally let me use all of the powers I had.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Host: Mathias Buné</strong></p><p><strong>Title: The Poor Noble, Pure Blooded Devil, The Farmer</strong></p><p><strong>Age: 14 years old. </strong></p><p><strong>Body: B</strong></p><p><strong>Mind: B</strong></p><p><strong>Spirit: B</strong></p><p><strong>Magic: B</strong></p><p><strong>Luck: C+</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Skills:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Buné Clan Trait:</strong></p><p><strong>Dragon Taming: B</strong></p><p><strong>Dragonification: B</strong></p><p><strong>Dragonfire: B</strong></p><p><strong>Dragon's Aura: B</strong></p><p><strong>Dream Manipulation: C+</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Zagan Clan Trait:</strong></p><p><strong>Life Magic: B-</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Magic:</strong></p><p><strong>Teleportation: C+</strong></p><p><strong>Bounded Field Creation: C+</strong></p><p><strong>Memory Alteration: C+</strong></p><p><strong>Barrier Magic: C+</strong></p><p><strong>Spatial Magic: C+</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Martial Arts: C+</strong></p><p><strong>Touki: B+</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Abnormality Resistance: B</strong></p><p><br><br></p><p><strong>Farm Management</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Farm Rank: B</strong></p><p><strong>Farming Points: 12,076.</strong></p><p><strong>Money: 25,488,000Ⱡ</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Shop</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Inventory</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The next farm Upgrade requires 10 Million Points and some other requirements for the Farm.</p><p><br></p><p>Still I could now use all the power I had gotten in this time.</p><p><br></p><p>The crops give better produce with each increase in rank. It’s just that they take longer to grow. Thus it took me around eight months to get from D Rank to C Rank and two years and eight months to get from C Rank to B Rank. The next upgrade will likely take me around four or so years at the very least.</p><p><br></p><p>This Farm Upgrade gave me a lot to work with too.</p><p><br></p><p>The Function I got from this was to create artificial biomes. Basically I can create artificial environments in any of my farm areas, including tundras that were at sub-zero temperatures to volcanoes with temperatures over thousand degrees easily.</p><p><br></p><p>It even provided plants that can grow in such biomes. Some plants need to be sown in the walls of active volcanoes and be submerged with magma for them to grow. The B Rank Stuff was getting insane. I even saw some more of the Toriko world’s plants.</p><p><br></p><p>It was time to create the new Space Pockets for my Farms. The Real Farm needs to be hidden from others.</p><p><br></p><p>Too much work to do.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Armin -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Armin teleported back to his home. The new weights were straining his muscles but the last barbecue was so worth it.</p><p><br></p><p>If someone heard the Heir of the Glasya-Labolas working in the fields like a common peasant just for some barbecue at the end of the day, they would probably get their ears checked.</p><p><br></p><p>Those fools however didn’t know about the anomaly that was Mathias Buné and the taste of the produce in his farm.</p><p><br></p><p>He hadn’t been kidding when he said that he was seriously waiting for Mathias to turn of age just so that he could have his favourite dishes at home.</p><p><br></p><p>Armin remembered the odd boy he had met in a party over a year ago after hearing Zephyrdor and his dumb friends had just made fun of someone.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy had laughed it off. Armin had always been taught to read other people and think logically by his family. He couldn’t find a trace of malice in the boy which got his attention. Him conversing with the young former heir of the Bael was also a point of curiosity. The Bael had all but isolated the boy because of his inability to use Demonic Power and the other houses did the same, fearing the anger of the Bael. Not that there were many who thought well of the boy in the first place due to the very same reasons. The only ones who didn’t change their behaviour towards him were the select few who could stand against Lord Bael like the Gremory, Sitri, Astaroth, Agares, etc.</p><p><br></p><p>As he stayed in the party with the infamous Farmer Noble, he found the boy truly refreshing after having been forced to bear the parties with arrogant little schmucks for so long.</p><p><br></p><p>Then came him giving a Dragon to his teacher’s daughter… just because she was his teacher’s daughter. Back then he had thought that the guy was an excellent liar because he couldn’t detect a single hint of any lie from him or just a fool.</p><p><br></p><p>It would take him several more meetings to realise that the guy simply didn’t care. He didn’t care what others thought of him. Not to say that he would behave badly. He just didn’t care if they mocked his way of life, his farm or him as a peasant.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy was even proud to call himself a farmer.</p><p><br></p><p>Most of all, he had been one of the very few people who had actually supported him in his painting career. That’s when Armin decided to become friends with Mathias Buné.</p><p><br></p><p>And till now he thanked his past self for making such a decision.</p><p><br></p><p>As he stayed with the boy, he realised that the guy was more, much more than he or anyone else for that matter knew about. His brother, Satan Falbium Asmodeus had explained the circumstances when he had become fast friends with the guy. They were keeping this a secret for his safety. The Heir of both King Zagan and Duke Buné Houses with both Clan Traits. Yeah, he understood the need for such measures, especially considering what he now knew about the guy.</p><p><br></p><p>The discovery about the farming tools had left him with a completely different view about Mathias. The guy was not wasting his time like others thought. He was using every waking instant of his time to train. He had ingrained all his training into his farming. It was a genius way to train once he understood it all and it was evident because to this day, he has never won a single spar against Mathias. He who had been trained by special teachers and peerage members of Satan Asmodeus and was praised all along, lost and kept losing to a self taught teenager went to show that Mathias was doing something right.</p><p><br></p><p>“Armin.” He heard a voice as he was heading towards his room. Looking around, he saw his father, sitting with his teacher.</p><p><br></p><p>In the corner of the room, he saw Zephyrdor smirking at him but just ignored it.</p><p><br></p><p>He was already tired for today and didn’t have the energy to waste with this guy.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Father? Good evening, teacher.” he bowed slightly towards his teacher.</p><p><br></p><p>“In half a year, you will be coming of age and making a debut in the Rating Games. I think you should be aware of this fact.”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded and his father continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have been hearing reports about long periods of disappearances for the last year. I don’t want or even like to interfere in your matters but it has been pointed out to me that you haven’t recruited any members for your peerage in all this time. I have given you all the freedom you have asked for and in return all I have asked for is that you keep the honour of our House. The Rating Games debut will be essential for your successful entry to the High Class Devil Society. A win is the only thing I expect as a loss would make people question your eligibility. Obviously such things can be fixed but this news always gets out sooner or later. You understand this right?” His father asked and he nodded. He did understand where his father was coming from.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, tell me what have you done in the past year?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I have been paying attention to my training, father. I wish to get stronger before I recruit any peerage member so as to be more efficient with my Evil Pieces.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s a wise choice, but a single piece cannot win a war. I know and approve of your decision, but I need to see that you have a good plan for the future. Accompany Edward for a spar and show me your progress. Let me see the results of your training. Show me an adequate result and I will agree with your method.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ahh, a spar at this time. He hadn’t fought with Edward for over a year. His teacher was an excellent fighter. Still, the condition was to give his father a good show, not defeat Edward. He should be able to do it.</p><p><br></p><p>He shook his head and stood against his teacher in the training grounds of his family as his father stood on the other end of the ground watching the spar.</p><p><br></p><p>“Young Master. Please pay attention. I expect that you will give it your all and not disappoint the Master.”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded slightly absent-mindedly. He was quite tired from the day’s work.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at Edward and he was moving slowly, much slower than he remembered him.</p><p><br></p><p>Wait. Was Edward holding back? Damn, did his teacher think that Armin had been skipping training and was holding back to cover for him?</p><p><br></p><p>It was a tad bit touching and insulting at the same time. In any case, Armin was not the kind of a guy who liked to win like this.</p><p><br></p><p>He kicked the ground and quickly appeared in front of his teacher. He would give his teacher a good fight and then win his father’s approval.</p><p><br></p><p>With this thought in mind, he punched towards his teacher’s stomach. He watched as his teacher’s eyes widened and he defended quickly, a barrier circle forming almost instantly before his stomach. He increased the force behind the punch.</p><p><br></p><p>The punch clashed with the barrier and it was crushed as if glass as the punch connected with Edward’s gut and he flew off, crashing on the other side of the training ground.</p><p><br></p><p>He waited for him to get up. Edward was really bad at acting. Did he think his father would be convinced by <em>this</em>? That level of Barrier Magic wouldn’t even stop a fly.</p><p><br></p><p>It's just that Edward seemed really into the acting as he didn’t get up at all and Armin felt a headache. He needed to put a show and go back and rest and here his teacher was wasting their time with subpar acting. There was no way his father would….</p><p><br>“Edward!” His father shouted and Armin’s jaw fell as he watched his father calling for servants and sending Edward back to be treated. What the heaven!?</p><p><br></p><p>His father apparently didn’t notice his stunned look and nodded towards him. “I see your training is coming out well. At this rate, I don’t think I need to worry about the future of the house.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Father but Edward…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Edward misjudged and paid the price. In real life battles, such things are normal. Both of us understand this. You don’t have to feel guilty about it.”</p><p><br></p><p>Feel guilty about being handed over the win by his teacher faking an injury. Now even his Father was feeling pity for him.</p><p><br></p><p>Shit. Somehow the taste of his favourite barbecue wasn’t as good anymore. It seems he will have to increase his training once more. Mathias would easily agree to a spar.</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah. Maybe he would increase the amount of land he worked on everyday for the next few months.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Mathias -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Sai left home with Mathers and I took some time to rest. I did exactly that and took a long nap.</p><p><br></p><p>I wasn't worried about my Farm's animals because two of my Dryads had reached C+ Rank and over a dozen more were in the C Rank. I still needed to work on my Hunter Squads but I think even then, my Farm is quite well protected unless someone extremely strong comes over to pick a fight. But if that's the case, me being asleep or awake wouldn't matter.</p><p><br></p><p>What I didn’t expect was waking up to three girls and a cardboard box with red eyes staring at me.</p><p><br></p><p>The girls were looking at me expectantly while the box was trying to appear unsuspicious but was failing miserably.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the girls had purple hair while the other two had blonde hair. The purple haired girl and one of the blonde ones looked around sixteen or seventeen while the other blonde girl looked around ten. I had no idea about how the one inside the cardboard box looked and yet I was almost sure about the identity of the one inside the cardboard box unlike the other three.</p><p><br></p><p>“I can only think of one being who could and would pull something like this, but I would still like to know. How did you all get inside?” I asked and checked, finding none of the barriers even tipped off slightly from the intrusion. I mean I knew who had done so and it was still frustrating to find that my barriers couldn’t even detect the guy. Stopping him was a futile effort, I knew that much.</p><p><br></p><p>The purple haired girl timidly brought up a letter which looked extremely familiar and passed it over to me.</p><p><br></p><p>I opened it and read the contents.</p><p><br></p><p><em>This should keep me covered for a few decades. They are members for your peerage. I made some changes in your Evil Pieces and you can reincarnate them easily. You are welcome.</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>Oh and I also left a gift for the Dragoness you are trying to court. Good Luck with her.</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>P.S. I have taken my payment.</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>P.P.S. I will take my payment every year like this, so keep them prepared. Also, the new variety of apples were much better.</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>The Most Awesome,</em></p><p><em>Great Red.</em></p><p><br></p><p>Hah. I knew it.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, did a red haired guy send you all here? On that topic, I don’t even know your names?” I used ‘Observe’ and suddenly understood why Great Red was like that.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ingvild Leviathan[Rank B]</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Lavinia Reni[Rank C]</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Valerie Tepes[Rank F]</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Gasper Vladi[Rank E]</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“I am Ingvild.” I saw how she hid her last name but didn’t blame her for it.</p><p><br></p><p>“Valerie and this is my friend Gasper.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Lavinia Reni.”</p><p><br></p><p>The purple haired girl, whom I now knew as Ingvild, shook her head. “I had a dream where you helped me. A voice said that you needed help.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the others and they nodded. Even the cardboard box shook.</p><p><br></p><p>Valerie added. “It said that if we needed a place to live, you would give us one.”</p><p><br></p><p>Lavinia was the quietest one but spoke too. “My Teacher doesn’t need me anymore. She even pretended to be killed to get rid of me. The voice showed me everything and offered a place to live. It said you needed someone to help you.”</p><p><br></p><p>… what the fuck, Red?</p><p><br></p><p>Are you emotionally blackmailing me?</p><p><br></p><p>Just how many things did you mess with to get them here?</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm, do you not need us here?” Valerie asked, a bit afraid.</p><p><br></p><p>I took a deep breath. “The voice you heard was of a friend… yeah, I guess you can call him that. He was kinda correct. I did need some helpers and I also needed members for my peerage. It’s time I started recruiting. I don’t want to pressure you all though. You can stay here and work on my farm with me. If anyone of you likes, they can join my peerage. If not, you can still stay here and work as long as you want. I will give you all salaries regardless. You two however,” I looked at Valerie and Gasper. “Need to study first.Train and exercise a bit and become stronger.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm Sir.” Ingvild started to speak but I stopped her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Just call me Mathias. I don’t like being called Sir or Master or anything like that. The last person who called me those things, kinda poisoned me and I haven’t had anyone working for me since then. It brings back a lot of bad memories.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We would never…”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am not saying you would, just that it brings back a lot of bad memories. Any questions?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm.” Valerie raised a hand. “What do we need to do?”</p><p><br></p><p>“You two will need to study and train. Farm work is hard. Learn to take care of flowers in the Garden and help out the animals. I will introduce you to everyone today. You two,” I looked at Lavinia and Ingvild. “I would need to know your skills. We will decide what work you will do after that.” I couldn’t tell them that I knew them from my memories. That would be super creepy.</p><p><br></p><p>“I-I agree to be your peerage member… if you will have me. Gasper will join you too.”</p><p><br></p><p>I sighed a little, went ahead and patted her head. I felt a slight disturbance in the world and realised that it was Gasper’s Sacred Gear activating. I looked at the box and slowly kneeled in front of it.</p><p><br></p><p>“I-I am sorry. I am sorrryyyyyyyyyyyy. I didn’t mean ittttttt.” The one inside the box cried out in panic.</p><p><br></p><p>“I know. Don’t worry about it. We sometimes get too excited or just upset and it can lead to such things.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Y-you are not affected by it? You didn’t stop.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am strong.” I replied, flexing my biceps. “I understand your situation. I also have a similar problem. I used to turn into a Dragon when I got too angry. You just need to learn to control it. I will not say that it will be easy but… I will sit with you every time you mess up until you are able to control it perfectly. You will not be alone in this… scary world. Is that alright with you, Gasper?”</p><p><br></p><p>“R-really?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Promise.” I put a hand forward and slowly a hand came out of the cardboard box and touched it.</p><p><br></p><p>The time went back to normal once more.</p><p><br></p><p>I then went on to explain about my farm to all of them while I prepared enough food for them to eat. I will have to introduce Sai to them when he arrives.</p><p><br></p><p>Well, at least it will get lively around here soon.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I showed the newcomers around the farm. Ingvild took a liking to the Water Area and Lavinia was just working around with the Dryads to manage the Hunting Squads. The Tri-hounds had taken a great liking to the girl. Valerie and Gasper were working in the garden where I had planted some Blood Berries. These berries help recover blood when eaten. It was used for treating any of my Hunting Squad if they needed it but they can be used for other living organisms too. Apparently Valerie and Gasper were attracted to it, what with being a Damphir and all. Good thing, I didn’t have to worry about their food.</p><p><br></p><p> It was time for harvesting the new crops.</p><p><br></p><p>The Farm Upgrade had left me almost without any stock. Whatever I had was just enough to feed the Ranch Animals.</p><p><br></p><p>The B Rank Upgrade was something I had been waiting for a long time because it had the Pet I needed. I couldn’t get a higher ranked pet than my Farm Rank. The one I needed had a newborn at B Rank, so I had to avoid the temptation to use the ticket earlier. But another requirement for this Pet was the humongous amounts of food it needs to grow.</p><p><br></p><p>Like the amounts almost made my knees weak when I saw it the first time… but despite everything, it was still worth it.</p><p><br></p><p>I have been stocking up on its feed for over two years now so that I don’t run out when I finally get it.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, after today’s harvest, I can get it.</p><p><br></p><p>The newcomers all seem to have issues of their own. Ingvild doesn't have any family members she remembered from before going to sleep(at least no one that wouldn’t try to kill her).</p><p><br></p><p>Lavinia was just plain heartbroken at her teacher giving her up.</p><p><br></p><p>Valerie and Gasper were happy and scared. Happy that they got out of their prisons and scared that they might be thrown out by me if I didn’t find them useful. The second part made me sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>Great Red apparently led them here and told them that they would find a place to stay here. Not exactly a lie but still… I have a feeling that I am being cheated somewhere.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean fine… I agree that I will be happier with some people living around. Sai alone living here made the place brighter. That said, the guy was a training freak, and coming from me… that’s saying a lot.</p><p><br></p><p>Having some pretty faces around is not something I would say no to.</p><p><br></p><p>These people needed homes and I needed people to help out. It works out too well. Shit, I can’t even find a fault with the overgrown reptile for doing this.</p><p><br></p><p>Today, however, I was going to do something else first.</p><p><br></p><p>I took the orb left by Great Red as a gift for Tiamat.</p><p><br></p><p>Tiamat had been out for a few days and had only returned today and I was waiting for her to visit.</p><p><br></p><p>And my wait didn’t last long as I felt her arrival near my resting place.</p><p><br></p><p>I went towards her and saw her watching the new girls. She saw me approaching and opened the conversation first. “New helpers?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm. They were sent here by the annoying guy in return for the apples. You might have already noticed that the trees were suddenly empty.”</p><p><br></p><p>Her eyes widened for a bare fraction of a second before she controlled it and took another look at the four.</p><p><br></p><p>“Two vampires, a devil, no, a half devil and a human girl.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Each with a Longinus or similar level Sacred Gear.” And for the second time, I saw Tiamat surprised. “By the way, here. I think I should give this to you.” I handed her the orb.</p><p><br></p><p>She took it and looked at it carefully.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is this?” She asked, not understanding what the object was.</p><p><br></p><p>“Annihilation Maker. Press it on your chest and it will be transferred to you.”</p><p><br></p><p>Her eyes trembled. In all this time, the only thing I have seen affect Tiamat was anything related to her mother.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are giving this to me? You understand what this is right? With your situation, this would help you a lot. It might be exactly the thing you need to advance your Life Magic to the next stage. You even want to defeat me. This will make your job several times harder. Did you even think about this?” She asked me, her voice shaking towards the end.</p><p><br></p><p>“I did. Sure it would help me out a lot and probably even solve several of my problems, letting me live a longer life, but… I would always have to live knowing that I sacrificed my first friend’s happiness to achieve it. The thought itself leaves me quite bitter. I don’t want to experience it. I mean losing my sleep for hopefully a long life over some quick increase in power. You know, how much I like my naps. This is something belonging to your mother. Probably one of the last things in this world. For me, it might just be a way to quickly get some power but for you… it is beyond it. So, stop worrying about me and take it already.” I took the orb and pressed it on the centre of her chest and the orb shattered, enveloping the Dragoness in a blue light.</p><p><br></p><p>Her form started to change and soon enough there was a magnificent Blue Scaled Dragoness in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>Her aura was stronger, much stronger than before.</p><p><br></p><p>I used my Observe and the results caught even me off guard.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>[Tiamat, Rank: A-]</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She directly jumped into the level of a Heavenly Dragon and even now her aura wasn’t stabilised. She might become even stronger when her aura stabilises.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Tiamat -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>This feeling was unlike any she had felt before. She somehow felt more… complete. Like something that had been taken away from her, that she didn’t even know was just returned to her. Her power was not stable yet she could feel that she would become even stronger once she controlled all of this.</p><p><br></p><p>Long ago, she had tried every way she could think of to use the Life and Creation Magic of her mother but was unsuccessful. She was mocked by many but she always beat them up. But at the end of it, she had given up.</p><p><br></p><p>She had chosen to wield her fire and make it capable of destroying all life instead. Fire that brings chaos, giving her the title of the Chaos Karma Dragon, Tiamat. And she became successful in this. Her flames were strong enough to rival that of that muscle-head Ddraig.</p><p><br></p><p>But now, she felt it. The power bubbling inside her. The essence of this power was completely different from what she had before. It was completely different from her chaotic flames. This one was like water. Soft and yet strong. Malleable and yet stubborn. A force that can bring about both life and destruction. </p><p><br></p><p>She finally understood it, The truth. It all began in the water and it would all end in water. It is the all birthing mother and an all devouring serpent. This was the power of the Dragon Goddess, of her mother, Tiamat.</p><p><br></p><p>A roar of freedom escaped from her throat and sounded through the entire area. The barriers of the Farm contained most of it but it still caused several of the stronger Demonic Beasts to run back away towards the Pits while the weaker ones just fainted.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally remembering something, she turned back into her human form and looked at the boy who had given her this life changing gift just smiling at her. No hidden pretences, genuine happiness for her and felt warmth bubbling in her heart.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy had pestered her religiously for two years to become his queen and when he was so near the goal(She could sense how strong he had become due to some of her treasures), he gave it all up just to see <em>her</em> happy. He could have easily given her this after he had made her his queen or not given her anything at all. She couldn’t have blamed him for it. She understood what the Annihilation Maker represented. It was a power that could make even a normal Human rival beings like her. For someone of his level of strength, he would have reached the Levels of Sirzechs and Ajuka, making a place for himself in the Underworld in one fell swoop but he gave it all up for her.</p><p><br></p><p>She tried repeatedly to search for any kind of deception but didn’t find any.</p><p><br></p><p>She stood in front of the boy. The other helpers in the farm were all looking from a distance, shaken at the sudden change.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are a fool.” She snapped at the boy.</p><p><br></p><p>The blunt fool just smiled innocently at her. “Tia, I think your roar did a number on my ears. You are saying thank you but I am hearing something different. I heard you calling me a fool.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s because you are a fool. Bring out your Evil Pieces.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Bring out your Evil Pieces. Be quick. I haven’t had my breakfast yet and am getting hungry.”</p><p><br></p><p>He brought out a case of Evil Pieces and opened them suddenly pausing and staring at the set.</p><p><br></p><p>She went forward and took a look.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, this is what he meant by changing my pieces.”</p><p><br></p><p>All the pieces were a darker shade, a deep crimson colour.</p><p><br></p><p>Mutated Pieces.</p><p><br></p><p>She picked up the Queen Piece and handed it to him. “Use it on me.”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy’s smile disappeared and he stared straight into her eyes. “No. I haven’t defeated you. You gave me a condition. I am not backing out.”</p><p><br></p><p>She let out a sigh as she had already expected that response.</p><p><br></p><p>“I gave you a condition and I am changing it now.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No take backsies.”</p><p><br></p><p>She massaged her head and let out a sigh as she spoke again. “If you don’t use it now, there is a chance that I might develop Divinity and it would never be usable. The Evil Pieces are not usable in Gods.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Doesn’t matter. I will lose then.” He replied although she noticed the slight bit of sadness in the voice.</p><p><br></p><p>She knew how stubborn the boy was and thought of a different settlement. “Then I suggest a middle road. Make me your Queen now. You will however not get to call me a Queen or order me around until you defeat me in a fight. If you never do that, consider your Queen Piece lost forever. If you lose the bet, there must be some consequences, right? Moreover me gaining the boosts from the Queen Piece will be more difficult to defeat. This will be your penalty.” At the end she added something from her side, “Do it for me.” and his gaze shook.</p><p><br></p><p>He let out a sigh of defeat and looked at her once again. “Are you sure of this?”</p><p><br></p><p>“You either are the biggest manipulator in the world or the biggest fool and I am inclined to think it’s the latter one. Obviously I am sure about it. Now be quick.”</p><p><br></p><p>He pouted at her comment but raised the Queen piece and placed it on her chest once more and she felt the changes occur in her. She didn’t resist but accepted it and felt the piece merge with her soul.</p><p><br></p><p>Two bat-like wings popped out of her back.</p><p><br></p><p>And just like that, she, the Chaos Karma Dragon, Tiamat became a devil.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Great Red -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He smirked, taking a bite of a Dragon Apple, as he watched Tiamat becoming a Devil. It was the first step in his plan and the world already had a new Heavenly Dragon once more.</p><p><br></p><p>He knew that the guy would never go out of his way to interfere in the affairs of others. So, he thought of it from the other way. If he won’t go out to seek the intruders, what about the intruders seeking him themselves?</p><p><br></p><p>He found people who would play very important roles in the world’s future from the memories of Mathias and delivered them to him. They would become strong obviously by staying near the guy and the world would have a force that can defend it. And if someone tried to take them away, they would face a mad dragon’s outrage. Either way, the talents of this world would be protected and nurtured as they become stronger to protect the world from any attacks.</p><p><br></p><p>A simple but master plan.</p><p><br></p><p>Asking the boy to become a minion was as he had already mentioned, was not the way to go around things. If he earned the ire of those two beings, he didn’t know what would happen. The world might not even be left for anyone to protect. Thus, he changed the problem on its head and made the boy the centre of the world. If anyone wants to destroy the balance of the world, they will have to face Mathias Buné Zagan. It will make things easier for him to defend.</p><p><br></p><p>It was not in his nature to manipulate but it didn’t mean that he couldn’t do it.</p><p><br></p><p>Moreover, was manipulating someone who is actually becoming happier due to it, really bad?</p><p><br></p><p>Eh, he didn’t care. The guy wouldn’t either, knowing and observing him for this long, he knew about his nature closely already.</p><p><br></p><p>Also, the deal got him these delicious apples… which was capable of increasing even his power. It might be a drop in an ocean but… even oceans are made up of drops.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: LuluViBritania(FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>So, another chapter of The Farmer.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Mathias had a meeting with Great Red who has a plan.

I still don’t have any peerage members though.The power of the Evil Pieces depends on the King they are bound to so I decided to become stronger first before getting any Peerage Members.</p><p><br></p><p>These two years have been peaceful, mainly due to Sirzechs’ secret support. He really kept others from intervening or even finding out about me because I didn’t want anyone disturbing my peaceful life. Sure he has a political agenda behind it but the guy is genuinely a nice person. Only that he is in a position that wouldn’t let him not use me in a political agenda.</p><p><br></p><p>Humans are selfish beings. The only ones who would be completely selfless towards you from the start are your parents and sometimes not even them. Other such relationships have to be developed to such a level with time and many hardships, be it friendship or true love(I still think that is a myth). And here we are devils, the embodiment of sins, it wouldn’t make sense for anyone to not have any motives to approach me. The thing which matters is how they are in the relationship, be it friendship or any other for that matter. I am not arrogant enough to think that people will wag their tails in front of me due to the greatness of my personality or goodness of their hearts the first time they see or meet me.</p><p><br></p><p>“What are you thinking about, brat?” said a female voice from behind me as a few seeds of dragon apples flew by the side of my face and into the pit I had dug for the animals to eat. “That’s not the look of a fourteen year old. It looks like you are an old man deep in thought. I don't even have such a look when I am thinking.” The blue haired woman behind me spoke.</p><p><br></p><p>“I was having philosophical thoughts about life. It’s something that I do after a day of hard work. Makes me feel wise.” I replied, giving her a smile as she just rolled her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Learning that from that tutor of yours? She did look as brainy as that hardass brother of hers.” She scoffed.</p><p><br></p><p>My tutor, Leila Astaroth, was the younger sister of Ajuka Beelzebub. She was a branch family member of the Astaroth Clan and was married to Septus Agares, the younger cousin of Lord Agraes. They had a daughter together called Latia Astaorth who was eleven years old this year. Leila is a very calm woman. She exhibited this aura that made one feel peaceful, probably taking more after her father who was a Stolas who were famous for their knowledge and Earth Manipulation Skills and were renowned herbalists and was thus very interested in the plants that I grew. We talked in detail about those things when I visited her for my classes. I was however told to not talk about my powers to anyone else. My Zagan powers that is. It actually kinda made me appreciate Sirzechs’ actions. Simply knowing how many people want me dead was a chilling realization.</p><p><br></p><p>Leila not only taught me about manners and etiquette but also about the politics of the Underworld, the factions, their agendas and the motives behind any actions they took. It was those lectures that made me see the cold and logical side of the woman and realize that this was in fact the sister of Ajuka Beelzebub. But through all this, the best thing about her that I liked was that she never lied or held anything back from me. She gave me the facts as they were and any questions I had or arguments were turned inside out through cold hard logic. She dissected everything and laid it out in front of me just so that I could accept the truth. Did it make me slightly colder? Maybe. Did I regret it? Nope.</p><p><br></p><p>She is one of the people that I have come to respect in this life.</p><p><br></p><p>She told me many things I didn’t know. Ajuka Beelzebub didn’t like politics. True. It was because he found their dumb logic unbearable. The way they hid their personal agendas behind flowery words made him want to shoot himself in the head rather than sit through such a meeting. It definitely wasn’t because he was incapable of doing politics. He just disliked it in general.</p><p><br></p><p>Ajuka can be very convincing when he wants to and he doesn’t need the use of his powers most of the time. A fact that was proven by how he could convince Tiamat of all people to be my guard.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, the blue haired woman behind me was the Dragon King Tiamat. I mean shouldn’t it be Dragon Queen? She said that she didn’t name herself that and she didn’t care either.</p><p><br></p><p>“My tutor is brilliant.” I countered, pouting slightly.</p><p><br></p><p>“I never said she wasn’t.” she yawned lightly.</p><p><br></p><p>She was here for her breakfast which was Dragon Apples. Apparently all dragons liked them. Many didn’t need them to live like others but they liked them nonetheless.</p><p><br></p><p>She came here every morning for her breakfast and then returned to her cave, around 20 kilometers away from here.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, I forgot to ask something.” I stopped her as she got up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes?” she asked, slightly confused.</p><p><br></p><p>“Won’t you become my Queen, Tiamat?” I smiled and she sighed.</p><p><br></p><p>“You really don’t give up, do you, brat? It’s been two years since you met me and each and every day, you ask me the same question only to get turned down everyday. At this point, I cannot even get angry at you anymore. Can’t you just give up already?” She facepalmed at my question.</p><p><br></p><p>“I mean why would I give up. Have you seen yourself? You are strong, smart, gorgeous and have that sass that I like in a conversation partner. I would love to have you as my Queen. As for giving up, many good things in life are difficult but does that mean we should give up?” I replied with utmost enthusiasm.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have worked with Ajuka for two hundred years now and even he didn’t ask me this question more than eight times. You are probably the most persistent one I have ever met. It may probably also be because I burn anyone that asks me this question. Be happy that you can grow these delicious apples and I can tolerate you more.” she scoffed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Really? Do I really have no chance?” I asked, making a questioning face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why do you even want me in your peerage? You are not even interested in Rating Games and all.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I told you already, I like you and want you to stay by my side. It’s a purely selfish reason.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah. purely selfish alright. At least you don’t use flowery crap or arrogant bullshit that the previous burn victims had spoken. It just makes you more bearable than the rest. Maybe someday if you can beat me in a one on one fight. We dragons respect strength and you have that blood in you too. Defeat me in a straight fight and I’ll consider.” she waved at me and teleported away.</p><p><br></p><p>Beat her in a one on one fight?</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah, right. She is a B+ Rank, easily. Just below the Heavenly Dragon level.</p><p><br></p><p>With the rate things are going on, I wouldn't be anywhere near her level in the next three years at the very least, unless I spend every waking moment just farming… But that kinda defeats the purpose of having a peaceful life altogether.</p><p><br></p><p>I checked my Status once more to see the progress made in these two years.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Host: Mathias Buné</strong></p><p><strong>Title: The Poor Noble, Pure Blooded Devil, The Farmer</strong></p><p><strong>Age: 14 years old. </strong></p><p><strong>Body: C+</strong></p><p><strong>Mind: C+</strong></p><p><strong>Spirit: C+</strong></p><p><strong>Magic: C+</strong></p><p><strong>Luck: C+</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Skills:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Buné Clan Trait:</strong></p><p><strong>Dragon Taming: C+</strong></p><p><strong>Dragonification: C+</strong></p><p><strong>Dragonfire: D+</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Zagan Clan Trait:</strong></p><p><strong>Life Magic: C+</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Magic:</strong></p><p><strong>Teleportation: C</strong></p><p><strong>Bounded Field Creation: C+</strong></p><p><strong>Memory Alteration: D+</strong></p><p><strong>Barrier Magic: C</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Martial Arts: C+</strong></p><p><strong>Touki: C+</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Farm Management</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Farm Rank: C</strong></p><p><strong>Farming Points: 20,076.</strong></p><p><strong>Money: 12,088,000Ⱡ</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Shop</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Inventory</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Things had slowed down a little but that was the way to be expected. The System either let me sell the produce to it to make extra points or sell them to others to make money.</p><p><br></p><p>I thankfully sold all the products through my teacher and she was a shrewd businesswoman who knew how to hide the evidence. To be honest, I have doubts that they are probably stocking up the products and paying me the money for it. I did give her a 20% cut in the profits though.</p><p><br></p><p>This is something I accepted because we jointly decided to hide everything about my Zagan abilities till I become an adult and strong enough to protect myself.</p><p><br></p><p>Fun thing is that I am already as strong as the first and the strongest of both Zagan and Buné had been before their deaths. Not that anyone knew about it. Tiamat was the only one who did and she actually kept it a secret. I asked her why she didn't report this and she claimed that she was asked a favour to protect me and even Ajuka couldn't pay her enough to spy on a child. Her pride wouldn't allow it.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, even she herself didn't know the full extent of my power or she wouldn't have made that bet with me in the first place. Maybe my Buné Dragon Tamer Trait was acting passively maybe.</p><p><br></p><p>Another problem was that I needed to save a lot of feed for some of the farm animals.</p><p><br></p><p>Maintaining a ranch was hard.</p><p><br></p><p>Currently my farm is spread over an area of 20,000 hectares. It doesn't even count the water bodies that I had to make around the place for some plants that only grew underwater and the underwater creatures that I was breeding. The water areas took about 2,000 hectares on their own. The entire farm was now divided into four parts.</p><p><br></p><p>Each part contains different grades of products, F, E, D and C.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, these areas were nearly impossible for me to manage on my own and there came my specially created minions. The Zagan Life Magic was as if just created for the purpose of farming.</p><p><br></p><p>I had over five thousand beasts under my command, starting from my digger worm squads making up a majority(which sounded much better than modified earthworms) to Mega Pelippers which kinda looked like their pokemon counterparts but were huge and could spray water from their wings. Each one of the birds had a wingspan of 11 meters. They were commanded to take water from the lakes and make it rain on certain areas at certain intervals. Then there were the Juggernaut Ox, who could use their different shaped tails as farming tools.</p><p><br></p><p>There were also my hunter squads both land and air ones, that chased and killed wild demonic beasts.</p><p><br></p><p>At my level, I could make creatures one full grade below my skill level.</p><p><br></p><p>For example at my current C+ Skill level, I could make life forms at D+ level which was basically the strongest High Class Devil Levels. This made my hunting squads a terrifying force.</p><p><br></p><p>They were mainly composed of my Trihounds who had different types of poison needles in their three types of tails, one for sleep, paralysis and killing each. The Nighthawks were similar as they could shoot their feathers with similar effects, yellow ones for paralysis, blue ones for sleep and black ones for killing.</p><p><br></p><p>Apart from that I had a special squad of ‘Pets’ that I had to grow - Dryads.</p><p><br></p><p>These spirits of nature took one thousand Farming Points a Pop to buy just in the seed form. These seeds, when sown, grow into a tree and give birth to a Loli Dryad at E+ Rank. Then they need to be fed, either fertilizers from the System or other living beings, their blood, flesh or even bones, basically organic matter to grow. They were said to have the potential to grow to B+ Levels at their full potential and that’s pretty insane in itself. That’s the level rivaling Tiamat. Dryads’ bodies also change shape and they ‘grow’ more humanoid as they grow in strength over time, starting from the Loli Tree Girl to a Hot Spirit Waifu. Growing a waifu on a farm. Yeah, I am living the life.</p><p><br></p><p>These Dryads are completely loyal to the one who feeds them their blood after they are born. Just a single drop is fine. I have forty of these working for me and they are all D Rank at the moment due to the demonic beasts my Hunter Squads feed them every day. A good thing about Dryads is that they will be almost immortal as long as their Trees (from which they are born) are alive.</p><p><br></p><p>At B Rank, they can become independent of their trees and move around.</p><p><br></p><p>My forty Dryads are the Squad I call the ‘Green Thumbs’ because they have very basic plant manipulation abilities and affinity with plants and animals. They are almost a plant girl, with tree-like features when they are young and slowly change to a more humanoid form as they evolve and become stronger.</p><p><br></p><p>Maintaining such a huge force is a difficult task. My Hunter Squads get attacked and injured most of the time. I had to make a different part of the field as a place to treat them. This happened only six months ago after I upgraded to C Rank. In this area are 40 Therapy Tulips managed by my Dryads.</p><p><br></p><p>Therapy Tulip, a plant from the Toriko world that eats the injuries of the ones that are placed inside it. The only drawback was that if they fainted inside it, they got gobbled up. This was however fixed to a certain extent by the Dryads maintaining the plants because they could more or less control the plant using their magic.</p><p><br></p><p>Upgrading the Farm Levels is becoming a massive pain in the ass. It took 10,000 Farming Points to upgrade from E to D, 100,000 Farming Points for Upgrading from D to C and now it needs 1 million Farming Points to go from C to B. This is not even counting the other requirements, especially when I am having trouble selling all of my produce now that people can ask about it. I mean it is still fine now but it will be a thing after I reveal myself as a Zagan and expand the business. This is why, I am going all in to become as strong as I can before I am 18 and of age. Things will start to get hectic from then on. I will need to expand my farm and get protection for my crops too.</p><p><br></p><p>Another important thing I discovered was that this was a genuine alternate universe and I was glad that I wasn’t trying to push my luck with my knowledge of the future.</p><p><br></p><p>What gave that away?</p><p><br></p><p>It was the lessons with Leila which helped me understand more about the world but even before that, it was the identity of one person whom I saw on TV.</p><p><br></p><p>The Queen of Serafall Leviathan, Euclid Lucifuge.</p><p>And boy oh boy had that been a shocker. Sirzechs was married to a Dantalion woman and had a four year old son who was coincidentally named Millicas.</p><p><br></p><p>Apparently it was Euclid who played the spy this time around and Grayfia was probably dead, or so I think people believe. I am not even sure what was what?</p><p><br></p><p>I guess there was a bit of regret of not getting to see the Maid Waifu. I was against NTR and I actually liked Sirzechs and Grayfia as a pair. They were adorable but hey, she was not married to Sirzechs in this world, so it’s fair game. Again, Serafall was actually not romantically involved with Euclid, it was her cousin who actually married the thankfully not obsessed sis-con in this world and had a daughter around the same age as Millicas too. Also no one fought Serafall for the position of the Leviathan and she became the Satan Leviathan uncontested. Euclid directly rejected taking that position and wanted to actually help Serafall while having more time for his family who back then was only his wife, Mariane Lucifuge.</p><p><br></p><p>Another thing that was a BIG stop sign for my knowledge were the stories from Tiamat. She was rather talkative when she got drunk and I had some good wine. It came from Septus, my tutor’s husband who helped to age the grape wine from my Farm’s grapes. Those things were D Ranked and packed quite a punch. We experimented with several of my Farm’s products after that. While my tutor asked me to keep things secret, her husband was in on it, so it was fine. It even gave me an idea about future industries that I may pursue with some kind of partnership with Septus or even the Agares House and the Archduke himself.</p><p><br></p><p>The wine of the Dragon Apples got Tiamat and me going. I had called her Tia-mama once while drunk and she had just stared at me for a long time and was quiet for weeks after that. It was only by my persistence that she told the true reason to me. And boy was that an eye opener.</p><p><br></p><p>Apparently, the original Tiamat, the Dragon Goddess, the Goddess of Fertility, the Mother Goddess was actually a thing. The key word here being, ‘was’.</p><p><br></p><p>That Tiamat was a primordial goddess of the sea, mating with Abzû, the god of the groundwater, to produce younger gods. In doing so however, she lost most of her powers as she gave them to her children. Those children however wanted to usurp the throne by killing their father, which they did. Tiamat in her rage created monsters and set them on the Gods.</p><p><br></p><p>She was later killed however and her body was cut into pieces and used to make several things. The ribs into the vaults of heaven and earth, her eyes the source of river Tigris and so on. What they missed however was that her energy had gathered in a different place and given birth to a different Dragon altogether, the current Dragon King, Tiamat.</p><p><br></p><p>She was in a way similar to Lilith, the dragon created from Ophis’ power in the Light Novels I remember.</p><p><br></p><p>Like wow.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t know that Tiamat had such a background.</p><p><br></p><p>This was apparently also the reason why she was actually interested in me, a Dragon or well kinda sorta Dragon with the power of Life Magic. She didn’t inherit those powers from her ‘mother’ and thus wanted to see for herself. I am supposedly the only dragon with such an attribute since her own ‘mother’. And maybe this is also why I get away with a lot.</p><p><br></p><p>To be honest I was kinda glad that the Paperwork Guy gave me this System. Farm Life is the best life. I work everyday and that doubles as training. The Magic part is fun and I can just let my imagination run wild here. My minions are adorable and badass at the same time. They can give puppy dog eyes and tear apart my enemies with equal skill. If that’s not brilliant, I don’t know what is.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Scene Change -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I was dressed in a suit. Not by choice, I tell you but I’d rather not have my teacher glare at me for coming to her daughter’s birthday in a hoodie. This thing was chosen by her personally and sent to me along with my last month’s payment so that I don’t make an excuse of not knowing or having any suits.</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah, I am going to Latia’s Birthday Party because I need to show my face sometimes to not be forgotten. I mean I wouldn’t mind that. In fact I want them to not bother me for like a few decades until I am S+ Ranked in all my Stats and Skills but that ain’t gonna happen. I was also quite a bit annoyed at all this pussy footing around this.</p><p><br></p><p>The reason was that even without my Zagan name, I was still the Heir of the Buné Clan. I had to attend social gatherings to make connections. I understood it, but I didn’t like it. I mean anyone would hate it if they knew what utter pieces of shit the young devil children could be. According to my teacher however, the adults were even more annoying and I should develop resistance to it.</p><p><br></p><p>The suit might not be my style but it did make me look good. It’s been six months since my challenge with Tiamat. I stood at 165 cm at fourteen years, six months due to my ripped body. It was a swimmer’s build(thanks to the Devil’s limited shapeshifting). I looked like a sixteen years old in terms of my body size. On second thought, maybe even my Buné Heritage helped me. </p><p><br></p><p>The venue was already decorated quite well. It was the birthday of Ajuka Beelzebub’s niece after all. That talk about Satans not being partial to their families looked good on paper and maybe was true to some extent too, especially for someone like Ajuka but if someone said they were completely neutral, that would be a big fat lie.</p><p><br></p><p>Thus the party had guests from all the Pillar Clans as well as famous devils from all across the Underworld. Man, I feel so out of place in such an event.</p><p><br></p><p>I walked towards the gate and the gatekeeper already recognized me from my visits to the place and simply bowed while granting me entry. Thankfully the event was in my teacher’s mansion and not the main Astaroth Clan palace. That would have been even gaudier.</p><p><br></p><p>The hall where the event was held was full already and I quietly occupied a place near the balconies to avoid the crowd. I mean I didn’t find anyone I knew there, not that I knew many people to begin with.</p><p><br></p><p>I soon found myself accompanied by another person who had quietly occupied the same place. A child with black hair and purple eyes was looking at the party while trying to make himself look invisible to the rest of the guests.</p><p><br></p><p>He probably didn’t expect me in the spot already and looked surprised and turned to go away, maybe to look for a different place but I stopped him. “Hey, there. I am not that terrifying that I would scare you away, now am I?” I smiled towards him. “Come on, join me here. I don't know anyone in the party and was getting bored out of my mind anyway.”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at me surprised but then again that changed with a bit of anger and then sadness. “I don’t think you would want to associate with me, Mister. People don’t exactly like me.” I saw his hands clench.</p><p><br></p><p>I narrowed my eyes slightly at the reply. I think I remember something like this.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, people can decide what they like or don’t for themselves, I make my own decisions. Come over here, sit by me. I am Mathias Buné, Heir to the Buné Clan. Nice to meet you. What’s your name?” I asked, to verify my guess.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at me for a bit and then hesitated but answered nonetheless. “I am Sairaorg Bael, I…. am from the Bael Clan.” He had his head bowed down as if waiting for me to snub him away.</p><p><br></p><p>As I thought, it was him. I knew about him but didn’t have an exact picture of him so wanted to verify.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nice to meet you Sairaorg. Now come here and tell me something about yourself.” I greeted without any change in voice.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked up at me surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>“What?” I asked completely unbothered.</p><p><br></p><p>“You…. do you not know who I am?” he asked, completely dumbfounded.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are Sairaorg Bael. You just introduced yourself silly. Why wouldn’t I know who you are?” I completely ignored what he was implying. The child had his confidence stomped on by almost everyone he met. It was kind of sad to even think about it. I think his mother fell sick recently too. Poor guy must be devastated. The fact that he even dragged himself to this place was already admirable.</p><p><br></p><p>“I… I mean, I , people don’t like me. I didn’t inherit the Bael House Trait. They all call me a waste.” he cried out half surprised, half angry at my casual behaviour.</p><p><br></p><p>“My parents didn’t inherit their families’ Trait’s either but that doesn’t mean they weren’t badasses. Who says you have to inherit the Clan Trait to be strong?” I countered.</p><p><br></p><p>“B-but I cannot use magic. I don’t have enough Demonic Power, less than even a Low Class Devil.” He countered back, his voice containing a bit of hope this time as he looked at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well not having magic can suck.” I saw him look down in defeat but I continued before he could say anything else. “But what of it? Don’t you have your two hands? Also you didn’t inherit the Bael Clan Trait, which was from your father, correct?” He nodded and I continued, not giving him any chance to reply, “Have you tried seeing if you inherited your Mother’s Clan Trait? I mean you have two parents’ correct?</p><p><br></p><p>He looked surprised and then confused, \"No….I don't know.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Well then stop sulking and find out. As for not having magic, you have your body, right? Train it till you can surpass others.\" I lifted a finger and a white aura covered my fingertip. \"This is called Touki. It is a form of manipulation of Life Energy and can enhance the strength of the user greatly. Beings like Sun Wukong can use just this to match even Satans. So what if you don't have magic. There are still other things in this world other than magic. Some are just as cool if not even cooler.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I, can I learn this? I mean how can I learn this?\" He asked, looking at my glowing fingertips.</p><p><br></p><p>\"You need to train. You need to train your body until you pass out, over and over till you break through your limits and let the power of youth burn, YOUTH! and oh… you need to eat your veggies. Yeah, eating veggies is important.\"</p><p><br></p><p>And after that I explained to the twelve year old the wonders of youth and vegetables.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Leila Astaroth -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>\"Your student has quite a way with words. I don't think I have seen Sairaorg look so enthusiastic about anything since Misla fell comatose due to her illness.\" Venalana Gremory said, looking at her former student.</p><p><br></p><p>\"No, he's just a blunt guy. Getting him to learn tact is just as hard as getting Ajuka to attend political meetings.\" She scoffed although if someone noticed her closer, they would find a shadow of a smile on her face although they would need to observe very closely.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I'd take blunt people over backstabbers anyday.\" Venalana rolled her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Of course she would. In private, Venalana was also just as blunt. In private though.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Is that?\" She squinted her eyes towards the raised fingertip of Mathias.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Touki. That's quite impressive for a fourteen year old devil. I don't think many youkai would even have that skill down so finely. Yes, that would be a good alternative for someone like Sairaorg. Touki and Senjutsu don't need any magic and can still make the user very strong. But even more than that, it will give him some hope. Dare I say the people of my former clan have done a great job beating it out of him.\"</p><p><br></p><p>That brat's been holding out on her. She pushed her thoughts aside as she answered.</p><p><br></p><p>\"He's very dedicated towards training his body.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Yes, there are rumours about the Farmer Buné. The narrow minded individuals laugh but no one sees that a fourteen year old orphan is already making plans for the future and sticking to it. That's more than what I can say about many others.\" Venelana replied as they both watched a bunch of children led by her younger cousin Diodora walk towards Mathias. She had an urge to hold her head. Mathias and her cousin didn't get along.</p><p><br></p><p>No, that would be putting it lightly. Diodora disdained Mathias as a lucky upstart who was beneath him due to the situation of his parents. His own parents did nothing to stop him either.</p><p><br></p><p>Mathias, on the other hand, just thought it was too troublesome to deal with brats, completely forgetting that he was a brat too. Now even that would have been fine. She did agree with his opinion about Diodora but that blunt moron had to just say that to her cousin's face. After that one incident, Diodora made it his life's goal to 'show the upstart his place' while Mathias completely ignored any attempts made by her cousin to rile him up. The worst part was that her uncle could never see any flaw in his son and allowed him to do whatever he wanted.</p><p><br></p><p>It was like both father and son were trying their very best to destroy her attempts to befriend the future economic giant that the hidden Zagan Head has the potential to become.</p><p><br></p><p>She had the urge to facepalm as she heard the following conversation.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Well look who's hiding here? It's the farmer who thinks he became a noble. How did you get that suit, Buné? Rented from someone? I don't think your wastrel parents had enough money for that.\" Her cousin taunted.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hahahaha is that the guy? And look who he's with. Isn't that the waste of the Bael? I guess even the Great King can't win it all. Those two make a perfect pair. Birds of a flock and all that.\" Was that the younger son of the Glasya-Labolas?</p><p><br></p><p>She saw Sairaorg clenching his teeth and getting ready to lash out but had his hair ruffled by Mathias who as usual ignored the taunts although the young Bael had a harder time.</p><p><br></p><p>She saw the irritated look on Diodora's face as he snarled, \"Pay attention you peasant!\"</p><p><br></p><p>Mathias looked around in mock surprise. \"Huh, is that you, Diodora? When did you get here? Sorry na, you are so tiny that I didn't hear you. So, why don't you <em>grow up a bit</em>? \" He gave the group a patronising smile. “And are these your friends? All so tiny. You should all grow up a little. If you remain like this, I can only keep on <em>looking down at you</em> while you will have to <em>look up to me</em>. You know what, eat enough veggies. It makes our minds sharper. And boy will you all need that?\"</p><p><br></p><p>The faces of the kids looked half confused and half angry but they didn't get a chance to retaliate as the birthday girl came out. The actual star of the party, her adorable daughter.</p><p><br></p><p>The kids were all called aside for the event.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I can see what you meant by blunt but still that was pretty tactful in my opinion. My Rias would have probably shot her power of destruction at his face the moment he started that rant.\" Venalana said and she had to roll her eyes. </p><p><br></p><p>\"Keep listening. You will know.\"</p><p><br></p><p>They did just that as the young Bael asked a question.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Why? How Are you so calm? Those guys insulted you, insulted your parents, so how can you be so calm?\" His tone became more agitated as he spoke.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hmm, well tell me something, Sai?... Can I call you Sai?\" The boy nodded and he continued. \"Okay, then tell me, uh you are walking on a road and a dog barks at you, will you bark back at it?\"</p><p><br></p><p>The young Bael shook his head. \"No, why would I do that? That would be stupid.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Exactly. You should only pay attention to people who can have proper conversations with you. Ignore the cats and dogs. They waste your time.\"</p><p><br></p><p>She saw her former teacher looking at him with a slightly dumbfounded look on her face and gave her two bits, \"The problem is, he would have given my Uncle the same reply if he was asked the same question. And that's what I am trying to teach him to avoid doing. Other than that, he's a very friendly guy as you already saw a while ago.\"</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Mathias -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The most troublesome things about such parties are gifts.</p><p><br></p><p>Devils love to show off.</p><p><br></p><p>It’s in their nature.</p><p><br></p><p>They reveal in vanity, well most of them.</p><p><br></p><p>Thus events like these become a place for such things as a matter of fact, especially when gaining the favour of Ajuka is involved, although knowing the guy, he won’t give a shit about their gifts. But that didn’t stop them from trying. The gifts were also a way to show off wealth and to mock others.</p><p><br></p><p>I did make a new friend, sort of though.</p><p><br></p><p>“Those are the Amon. They have very close relations with the Astaroth Clan. It was something about their head having his life saved during the Civil War by the Astaroth Clan and the two houses have stuck together since then. The one in the line is the second son of the Amon, Iolova Amon. I think there are talks of him being engaged to the Vassago Heiress.”</p><p><br></p><p>Armin Glasya-Labolas, the Heir of the Glasya-Labolas Clan. He is a year older than me. He came and apologised to me a few minutes later about his cousin Zephyrdos.</p><p><br></p><p>To be honest, I didn’t even know who the children were except that Diodora idiot.</p><p><br></p><p>Those troublesome things aside, we hit it off pretty well. He wanted to be an artist but was forced to keep aside his dreams for his position as the Heir and thus actually respected me who didn’t care about what people said and stuck to my farm. He is a very mild mannered guy, almost girlish but I did see the hint of steel in his eyes when he made Zephyrdos apologise to me.</p><p><br></p><p>I was being given the identities of the people who were giving their gift to Latia and the adorable little brat was accepting them with all the etiquette of the princess that she more or less was.</p><p><br></p><p>Soon it was Armin’s turn. His gift was already prepared by his family. It was a necklace enchanted with their Family’s Barrier Magic. The Glasya-Labolas are inherently good with all types of Barrier Magic due to their Clan Trait of Defence which is… guess what, a Barrier Magic.</p><p><br></p><p>He bowed and left soon after and it was my turn. I could feel the gazes of the people on my back as I stepped forward. My teacher gave me a slight nod.</p><p><br></p><p>I faced her and spoke, “My gift needs me to summon it. It would have been inconvenient to bring it with me. Do I have the permission to do so?”</p><p><br></p><p>General etiquette. You cannot summon anything in other people’s houses. That’s rude. Not to mention the barriers and wards around the house wouldn’t allow you to do so.</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded at me and a magic circle lit up on her palm, making me keyed into the barriers temporarily.</p><p><br></p><p>I sensed the one I wanted to summon, connected to my farm and my magic did the rest of the work. Soon enough after the Buné Magic Circle lit up, a creature appeared in my arms.</p><p><br></p><p>I saw the little brat’s eyes widen and even my teacher’s eyes widened a bit but her face returned back to its normal look as if that had been a mirage of sorts. Murmurs rose around me.</p><p><br></p><p>I however didn’t care. The little creature in my arms turned its head and looked at Latia and I spoke to it. “From today on, she is your new master. Serve her well, alright?” It looked back at me and nodded its head. “You can make a contract with it.” I told Latia as I handed her the creature in my arm, who mewled at her breaking her mask as she cuddled the little thing in her arms.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s… quite a gift. This is an Earth Dragon, is it not? They are known for their ferocious natures and even the hatchlings like these are very stubborn. It’s almost unseen for one to be this tame. I take it as your work. The Buné Dragon Tamer powers really live up to its reputation.” Ajuka spoke from the side and I nodded back at him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is this really that good? It doesn’t look like much. I mean it could be a cross breed or an inferior species.” And someone had to poke their noses and who else but the piece of shit, Diodora again.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean I don’t even know what that guy’s problem is. It’s not like I did something to provoke him in the first place.</p><p><br></p><p>Ajuka just acted as if he didn’t hear that. Yeah, just the way to deal with idiots like him.</p><p><br></p><p>“It is without a doubt an Earth Dragon, the scales on its back are proof for that. They are one of the hardiest Dragon species. An average Adult Earth Dragon could be an Ultimate Class being even without any kind of training while they have the potential to reach even higher levels if trained properly. I myself have an Earth Dragon ancestry. Moreover this breed of Dragon is extremely faithful to their partners and masters and  I believe little miss has received an excellent partner for the future.” The one who answered the question or rather whining was not Ajuka but rather, a Dragon himself. Tannin, Blaze Meteor Dragon and the former Dragon King who was in his chibi mode, flying above us like a stuffed toy.</p><p><br></p><p>The murmurs increased after the reveal while Diodora’s face was somehow the same shade as Tannin, purple.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you, Heir Buné.” Latia bowed.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are welcome, Miss Astaroth” I gave her a bow as I was taught by her mother and stepped back, arriving near Sairaorg and Armin.</p><p><br></p><p>“That was quite something. I didn’t think you would give her something like that. An Ultimate Class Being would be an asset to any house. You might not know but there are over a Dozen Clans without any Ultimate Class Beings and they would do almost anything to get their hands on one. Could it be, are you courting her maybe? I mean I wouldn’t be surprised. She is a good candidate.” Armin commented while I was trying my best to ignore the looks thrown my way.</p><p><br></p><p>“Leila Astaroth is my teacher. She has done a lot for me and I wanted to show my appreciation for her help towards me. Don’t think of this as more than what it is.” I stopped that line of thought. Who knows what kind of shit that road will lead me to. I need to get stronger first and think about ‘little me’ after that when I was sufficiently strong enough.</p><p><br></p><p>“B-but, don’t you want a dragon for yourself?” Sairaorg asked. “Dragon King Tannin said that it would become an Ultimate Class Being even without doing anything. Are you sure you don’t want something like that for yourself? They could be very useful in the Rating Games.” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>The only thing about that is that I just had to spend 3100 Points to buy the Egg for that little guy. I could buy more of them whenever I want. They were actually animals from my farm. Farms are also used to raise animals for different purposes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh, I am strong. What will help you in the end is your own strength. You can have a hundred dragons if you want but what’s the use if a single attack can kill you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“You have a very… unique way of thinking, Mathias.” Armin took a moment to find the right words to say.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am a Buné. I can become a dragon myself. As for wanting a Dragon, I can always find myself one of those at a later date. Don’t sweat it.”</p><p><br></p><p>The rest of the party was exactly what I hated in the party… troublesome.</p><p><br></p><p>Many people came to greet me all of a sudden and asked if I could tame a dragon for them.</p><p><br></p><p>I told them that I got lucky with the young one. I was still learning about my Clan Trait but still it was enough for them.</p><p><br></p><p>I met both Rias and Sona again. They came along with a group of other girls including Latia and Seekvairaa to meet me again.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias took the opportunity to show me the rabbit I had gifted her. Apparently Sirzechs had been feeding it the veggies from my farm and the little guy was quite strong now, almost as strong as a Mid Class devil. It had a small horn on its head and could use wisps of fire magic. It might have developed an affinity to fire magic from eating Fire Tomatoes.</p><p><br></p><p>It was still nothing compared to even my Hunter Squads, let alone the pets from the Farm but still for something created on a whim, it became something really good. I wonder how strong my Digger worms can grow if I raise them well with the veggies.</p><p><br></p><p>I obviously dropped the thought as soon as it came to me. I would rather make newer batches of Digger Worm v2.0.</p><p><br></p><p>The food was amazing. It reminded me that I needed a cook for my house. The thought about maids always left me iffy because of the last maid I or rather the previous Mathias had. I might have developed a subconscious trauma towards Maids.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe I should consider getting a peerage member, preferably someone who can cook well.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Scene Change -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I was on my farm. Two months had passed since the birthday party. I have a new friend and a few regular visitors to my farm.</p><p><br></p><p>Armin and I kept in contact after that party. Despite the girly looks, and calm and composed temperament, the guy was quite picky with his friends.</p><p><br></p><p>As for the visitors, the girls from the party visited me sometimes with their siblings. They didn’t visit the restricted areas though. Sirzechs wanted to ask if I made the earth Dragon and I just agreed. It would be stupid not to as my farm would be filled with animals more awesome than those. He wanted to ask if I could get a good pet Millicas for his birthday. He would owe me a favour. Although he asked for it to be presented away from other people’s sight. I could do as much for him. The guy was running around a lot for my sake and even asked Mathers to help me learn how to set up Bounded Fields and when I was strong enough, the Spells to create an alternate dimension like the Rating Game dimensions to hide my farm.</p><p><br></p><p>Currently, my C Rank Farm Upgrade gave me the ability to manipulate the space of my farm. I could increase the space in a certain area kinda like the expansion charms in the suitcase of Newt Scamander. The next level of the Farm will allow me to change the complete biomes of the areas.</p><p><br></p><p>The reason I am out right now is because for the past few days, a thief has been raiding the farm and eating the dragon apples.</p><p><br></p><p>They slipped through the senses of all my minions as well as the Dryads and that alone was something alarming for me.</p><p><br></p><p>The good thing was that whoever it was, all it did was eat the apples, mostly of the D Rank or above and leave. Why I knew they didn’t take the apples with them was because they threw the leftovers all over the place. All my traps and detection spells failed to even know when it came or left.</p><p><br></p><p>So, today I was keeping a night watch.</p><p><br></p><p>This farm is my hoard and no one touches a dragon’s fucking hoard.</p><p><br></p><p>Upon reaching the clearing, I saw the culprit. Red hair and a sharp face, muscular build, the guy smelled like a dragon. Somehow, my instincts were telling me that if I fought or even had a bad thought about it, I would die and I trusted my new Dragon Instincts a lot. It has served me a lot in the recent few months.</p><p><br></p><p>I used Observe on it and saw the name and my blood chilled.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>[Great Red, Rank S]</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The fuck.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, you are finally here. It was always those grass humans or those damned dogs and eagles. Come on, have a few, it’s your farm after all.” It spoke casually without even looking back.</p><p><br></p><p>A table and two chairs formed from nowhere in between us and I took it as an invitation and took my seat. He continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“These things are really something. I always come to meet you but I get lost in their taste. It’s nothing like the ones grown by other Dragons.” He turned around and several apples floated from the trees directly to the table in front of us as he took a seat. “So, I take it that you have questions.”</p><p><br></p><p>Well obviously. I have a ton of questions.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have a ton of questions too.”</p><p><br></p><p>My eyes widened as I looked at him casually taking another bite from the apple. It can read my mind!</p><p><br></p><p>“I cannot read your mind. Well not normally, I can when you are sleeping and dreaming. I can hypnotise and make you speak anything though. Also your face is just too easy to read.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So you have read my mind?” I asked as I was understanding the gravity of such a situation.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well yeah. It was interesting.” he shrugged his shoulders.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why? Why would the mind of someone like me be interesting? Why did you even think about reading my mind?” I asked him, already knowing the reply or at least a part of the reply.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, I roam around in the Dimensional Gap but that can get boring. I am the Dragon of Dreams after all so I can sometimes enter the dreams of others and watch things. It is a pass-time of mine. So imagine my surprise when I saw a dream about myself when I was doing my usual dream diving. A dream of me singing a ridiculously dumb song. It made me laugh, so much that Ophis would have gotten an aneurysm, so much… that I decided to see everything.” He stopped laughing and looked at me straight into my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>At this moment, I only had one thought in my mind - how the fuck did my farm game switch to the apocalypse mode so suddenly.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Great Red -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Great Red watched the boy's face turn into one of shock and then horror. It was not surprising.  Even someone like him was caught off guard when he had seen the boy's memories. His entire life being a dumb book.</p><p><br></p><p>At first he had laughed the things off but that was only until he saw the information about his death.</p><p><br></p><p>Oh he had scoffed at the boy. Even if he did have ideas about other worlds, something like this was still far fetched.</p><p><br></p><p>But the damned thought just refused to leave his mind and finally he decided… to investigate.</p><p><br></p><p>At first he found several inconsistencies with the boy's memories but then he started finding the similarities and even the coincidences had to end at some point.</p><p><br></p><p>The greatest alarm bell was when he checked the boob Dragon Emperor. He was the so-called protagonist of that damned world so it was evident that he would get something from checking it. And he struck gold there. Quite literally.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy was marked by a foreign Goddess, someone not from this world and someone strong enough that even he had to <em>seriously</em> look through the boy to find it.</p><p><br></p><p>The domain of the Goddess was something related to mind and corruption of some sort which were mixing with Ddraig's dragon aura. It could be used by the Goddess to monitor the boy as well as used to lend him some strength temporarily. The dots were connecting. The times in the memory when the boy could <em>magically</em> become stronger, why people around him became such idiots, why everyone was accepting such bizarre things as if normal.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy could read minds, awaken people whose minds had disconnected from their bodies, and many other things just didn't make sense given the boy didn't have any talent for magic or any semblance of magic power to be of worth. Normally being born with pitiful magic is common but having such amounts of magic even after having his body reconstructed by the power of two Dragon Gods?</p><p><br></p><p>One just didn't summon Gods from other universes just by desiring breasts or half the world would be doing the same.</p><p><br></p><p>Whatever the intention of this Goddess may be, he didn't want any part in it and neither did he want this world to be messed up because of it. This was his world, dammit!</p><p><br></p><p>So the first thing he did was put the Mark on the boy in a dream, so that the Goddess can only move about in a dream. Second, he covered the entire world in a barrier, hiding it between dream and reality that will make it nearly impossible to track or even find it. For the third, he came to the source of it all, the boy. He had several good things in his memories although everything about his so called Farm was blocked by a power that chilled even his blood.</p><p><br></p><p>Two beings stared directly into his soul, one with green eyes which flashed a rainbow couloured light while the other a soul chilling blue. He froze in place. He knew that those beings didn’t exist there. It was just a memory, an imprint and yet he couldn’t move. The Dimensional Gap around him started to shift as letters appeared in front of him.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>“Maybe in a billion eons… just maybe though.”</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p>This was a power beyond anything he could even think of. After being the strongest, being subjected to such an emotion was… humbling.</p><p><br></p><p>If such beings wanted to do something, they didn’t need to play around with a puppet like this. This… seemed to be some kind of entertainment for them. Just like he watched the dreams of others, they preferred to watch the life of the boy.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy himself was completely unaware of things and preferred to farm above anything else. There were no world destroying or world saving aspirations in his mind, just a peaceful life on his farm.</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s when he decided to use fire against fire. One was an opponent that could kill him with a mere thought while the other was someone manageable who was messing up the world. He couldn’t do anything for the first one but he sure as well could for the second and what better way to shove it to both the parties by using one outsider to fight the other.</p><p><br></p><p>The beings didn’t stop him from reading his memories but only appeared when the farm related topics were approached. That was a clear message that they wouldn’t babysit him.</p><p><br></p><p>He could still use the boy in some way. Maybe get an ally. Maybe subtly guide him to the other party. The second was out of question because of the boy’s knowledge and his own nature, disliking such underhanded tactics... The first was the only way left.</p><p><br></p><p>He could use the boy to make a strong enough force to resist the invasion of the ExE world or any others that may follow.</p><p><br></p><p>He would just needs to firmly bind the boy to the world.</p><p><br></p><p>And he was here to complete the first part of that grand plan… by… </p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Interlude -</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Sirzechs Lucifer -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“He said he made that Earth Dragon. Tannin however didn’t find any difference between them.”I informed the others sitting in the room.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, you are telling me that the boy, he’s becoming quite a hunk to be called a cutie now, made a real dragon?” Serafall called and he nodded even as he felt ridiculous while doing so.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you find any difference or speciality in it, Ajuka?” Falbium asked and the man shook his head before replying.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. The dragon was completely normal. I made sure to run several diagnosis spells on it but it was a healthy child, male and recently born. DId he tell you how he did that? The Zagan Trait is a complete unknown for us and even the books we could dig out weren’t very useful about it.” Ajuka asked and he nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“He said that he absorbs the life force from his plants and crops, and uses the energy from them to create beings beyond his own level. The more life force he pushes, the more perfect the creations. He has been experimenting with this skill for a while and the evidence is the different unique demonic beasts all around the farms that guard and maintain the place.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, new Demonic Beasts?”</p><p><br></p><p>“There were several kinds of demonic beasts, hounds, eagles and such. Mathews reported there to be gigantic birds that carried water from the lakes and sprayed it all over the fields to water the plants. They were well above normal Mid Class Demonic beasts and the guards that he assigned all around the place were all around High Class Demonic beasts. There are several hundred of them who go on rounds to hunt the beasts from the pits. Their teamwork was quite refined as they could work in tandem with each other to bring down their foes. They use the bodies of the Demonic Beasts as food or fertilizers for the plants. The other demonic beasts clear out the new areas and make it suitable for farming more crops.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Did he tell you how the Trait works?” Falbium asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t think we have the right to ask such questions, Falbium. If it is discovered, not only would several other houses raise shit over it, the boy himself might feel distrust. Remember that in just two and a half years he has an army of several hundred demonic beasts under his command. We are actually lucky that the boy is so obsessed with his farm. Did the psych tests that Leila perform on the boy give solid results?” Serafall asked in a rare Satan tone.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mathias has no interest in politics. In fact he was actually asking advice from my sister on how to avoid political meetings altogether. He apparently genuinely enjoys his work. My brother-in-law is planning to start a wine business with him. From what I have learned from Leila, although she denied telling me the details because he was her student, Mathias is a simple-minded guy who likes to avoid trouble and do his own work. He has shown good tolerance to taunts and is not biassed towards reincarnated devils or even those of other races. If she had one flaw to report about him, that would be his bluntness. The boy doesn’t like scheming and is absolutely straightforward in things he does.” Ajuka explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“My brother Armin also has only good things to say about him although he did say about his blunt nature too. My other cousin on the other hand <em>sigh</em> I am glad that it’s Armin who’s the heir.” Falbium sighed and he knew why too. “But do you think he will remain the same and not try to absorb life from things he shouldn’t to create stronger things?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t think that’s possible. He can apparently only absorb his crops. Even animals are immune to his absorption.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, then I might have an idea. It might be because the crops ultimately have his own energy which grows over time and he can absorb it easily as they don’t have the will to resist the absorption too. Animals on the other hand have their energy changed over time and have a will of their own to resist the absorption even subconsciously. If that’s the case then it’s understandable. What he is doing is temporarily increasing his power by using his crops as a battery of sorts and using this power to create new animals before he loses control of this. The new creatures thus born are stronger than what he can make normally. By the way, how about the rabbit that your sisters have? Are they still growing?”</p><p><br></p><p>“They are. Saggy is such a cutie. She even developed water magic and is as strong as a Mid Class Devil. So-tan is trying to teach her how to read although I don’t think it will be easy.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Rias’ pet rabbit or as Mathias’ calls them, Almiraj, Akame is also growing fine. She did grow a horn though and developed some Fire Magic too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are they being trained?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Only some basics of fire magic but they learn it naturally, that said, I have seen her staring at Beowulf practice martial arts and she never moves from the place. I think Rias has even recorded her trying to copy the moves and even move like Beowulf. It was adorable. I have consigned a pet for Millicas too. I personally think children can develop a good sense of responsibility and even learn how to manage their peerages well if they can train their pets like this. Normal familiars are not like this though.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s an interesting thought. Anyways, I want the details of their growth as well as the corresponding diets. Do they hit a ceiling in power or can they grow even without those crops? Is Mathias’ power needed to make them grow and even evolve maybe or is that growth happening with other food too? It will help me verify certain things.”</p><p><br></p><p>They all nodded and agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Still, I didn’t think the boy would give something like that to your niece.” Serafall laughed. “Many people were thinking that he was proposing to her.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I have heard such talks as well. Apparently Armin asked him that and he replied that it was because Leila was his teacher and he was showing his appreciation for her help.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ajuka pinched his forehead lightly, “Yes, about that. He didn’t have any such intentions but… now my sister actually has such intentions. She actually wishes to engage Latia to him and announce when he comes of age. She and my brother-in-law are still discussing the prospects of such a marriage. Latia has inherited my brother-in-law’s time magic and if paired with the Zagan’s life magic, the production of any crops will be increased by a lot. Latia is not the Heir and it will be good for her too. They still haven’t decided on it yet. It might just end up like that knowing my sister.”</p><p><br></p><p>“This… is actually really good news.” He said and his friend nodded as well.</p><p><br></p><p>“You do both know that when the news about his Heirships are revealed, especially his Zagan powers, the other houses will not allow him to have just one wife. The Great King faction will be on our heads for hiding the news even if we use the excuse of his protection and his own requests as a reason. They will not stop so easily.” Falbium commented.</p><p><br></p><p>“We will leave it for when that happens. For now, we need to make sure that he is trained well enough to survive the reveal of his identities. The reactions will not be from the devils of the other factions only but also from the Angels and the Fallen Angels. Tiamat can only protect him so much. I can understand why they were so frightened of the Zagan now but we cannot lose such a valuable ally.”</p><p><br></p><p>They agreed to this and then moved on to other important topics.</p><p><br></p><p>____________________________________x___________________________________________________________________________x_______________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: LuluViBritania(FF.N, SB and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>So, I got some inspiration and wrote this chapter too.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The time skip was to show his progress and the things he did.

What kinda wish did you choose?” he asked not even looking from the pile of paperwork in front of him.</p><p><br></p><p>“A Gamer System Sir.” I answered to the man who would give me my lifeline to survive in the foriegn world that I am about to be thrown into. It didn’t hurt to be respectful, meaningfully so.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, the most common choice for reincarnators nowadays. So, what kind of system do you want? There are too many nowadays. Explain it to me. Try to be brief.” he asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Are the Gamer Systems really that simple?</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm, let’s see. A levelling based Gamer System would be nice. Being able to level up my skills with practice. Oh yeah and farming items in the dungeon. I am the type to grind hard and farm a buttload of stuff before all the fights. I guess I am a hoarder. I have always liked the trading parts of the games a lot. So a Shop, maybe to buy stuff for myself with points or currency farmed from the Game. Yeah, that’s about it. Oh, one more thing. Maybe something to raise pets and stuff.I would like to live a peaceful life, grind and farm in peace and this seems like it really might be my type of system. Oh yeah, and no System AI please. Just give me a basic Observe skill instead to check out all the functions. AIs can be pretty annoying sometimes and I don’t know how I would feel about having a voice in my head at all times.” I thought of everything.</p><p><br></p><p>The man still looked busy with his paperwork so I decided to give him a call. “Sir, Did you listen to what I say?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm, oh yeah kid, totes. System, farming, levelling skills, shop pets and no AI. Heard everything loud and clear there” He quickly brought a paper from the side and jotted down the details and gave me a nod. “There you go. Know what, you’ve been a pretty good sport so I’ll throw in a freebie giftpack for newbies too. Good Luck kid. Have fun.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you, sir. I hope you can get some vacation too. This….looks really tiring.” I looked at the pile of paperwork that somehow seemed as if even more now.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, you have no idea just how right you are, kid. <em>Sigh</em> You’re a good kid. Take care.” he smiled and waved me off as I saw a flash of light around me and vanished to be reborn again.</p><p><br></p><p>The paperwork guy is a good man. Ah, I forgot to ask for his name.</p><p><strong>- Scene Change -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>That fucker screwed me up and I don’t even know his name.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the screen in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Host: Mathias Buné</strong></p><p><strong>Title: The Penniless Noble, Pure Blooded Devil, The Farmer</strong></p><p><strong>Age: 12 years old</strong></p><p><strong>Body: F</strong></p><p><strong>Mind: E</strong></p><p><strong>Spirit: E+</strong></p><p><strong>Magic: F+</strong></p><p><strong>Luck: E</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Skills:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Buné Clan Trait:</strong></p><p><strong>Dragon Taming: F</strong></p><p><strong>Dragonification: F</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Zagan Clan Trait:</strong></p><p><strong>Life Magic: F</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Farm Management</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Farm Rank: E</strong></p><p><strong>Farming Points: 4,000</strong></p><p><strong>Money: 200,000Ⱡ</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Shop</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Inventory</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I am stuck with the Farmer System. He totally wasn't paying attention. </p><p><br></p><p>Even the shop only has farming items, farm animals and everything is unlockable by different farm levels. </p><p><br></p><p>I can sell farm produce to the Shop to get Farming Points. Farming Points can also be earned for each successful plant grown. I get points based on the grade of the plant grown which depends on various factors like the quality of the final product, the difficulty to grow the plant, the rarity of the plant, the amount and type of Fertilizer used on the plants, etc.</p><p><br></p><p>There is still a limit to how much I can extend the rarity of a product and still make a profit. I mean there is no point in increasing the quality of a common um let's say mustard seed from F- to S+. That would take enough capital to make me a Heavenly Dragon Or probably even a Dragon God.</p><p><br></p><p>And that's what brings me to the last part of the System that has saved me from going into depression at the moment. The Skill Upgrade System. My Farming Points can be used not only to unlock various things but also to level up my Skills. They can obviously be levelled up training normally and basically any method used by other people but I can pay a certain amount of points to increase the level of the skills. </p><p><br></p><p>The skills are levelled as NA, F, E, D, C, B, A, S which is further divided into,  S-, S and S+ and such. I am provided with a comparison for this, F can be Low Class devils, E for Mid Class, D for High, C for Ultimate and above that, things take a steeper slope upwards with B- as Satan Level, B can be a Strong Longinus User like the Juggernaut Drive of the Heavenly Dragons, B+ to A-  can be real Heavenly Dragon Level Or Super Devil level, A for Indra level strong, A+ to S- for the Trimurti, S for Ophis and Great Red and S+ for maybe the ExE God's if they are a thing here.</p><p><br></p><p>The rarity of the products are of similar ratings.</p><p><br></p><p>I need 2 Farming Points to level up a skill from F- to F. Every sub level after that doubles the price of increase. From 2 to 4 to 8 and so on for every subsequent upgrade. </p><p><br></p><p>It does sound easy, doesn't it? </p><p><br></p><p>Basically around 4k points and I can become a Peak High Class Devil? </p><p><br></p><p>The truth isn't that easy though.</p><p><br></p><p>To get anything of a certain Grade, I will need to upgrade my Farm to that Grade too.</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully, Farm Grades don't have sub parts and just unlocking any grade, simply gives me access to the peak of that grade. Example, I just need to upgrade to an S Rank farm to unlock all upgrades and purchasables till S+ level. </p><p><br></p><p>The first upgrade took me an upgrade token that came in the Newbie Gift Pack. </p><p><br></p><p>The gift pack had 4,000 points, a Farm Upgrade Token, Seeds of some rare plants and a Pet Token which I haven't used yet.  It sure was more than I expected and helped reduce my anger towards the guy a lot. My friends always told me that I was very easy to pacify, maybe there was some truth to that statement as I was about to swear an eternal feud with the guy a while ago. </p><p><br></p><p>As for my identity, I am Mathias Buné, Son of the late Markus and Mariana Buné nee Zagan, both High Class Devils but neither inherited their Clan Traits. The two houses were more or less extinct too with my only other relative being Ladora Buné who was a Half Devil and thus shunned by the pillars in general.</p><p><br></p><p>A house going extinct is a complex matter. For Example the House of Buné is a Duke Ranked House with the Rank of twenty six among the seventy two pillars while Zagan is a King Ranked House with the Rank of sixty one among the seventy two pillars. </p><p><br></p><p>In essence both of these houses were supposed to be quite a big deal, the keywords here being 'were supposed'. </p><p><br></p><p>In the Great War, the Buné were on the front lines due to their fighting builds and powers. This left them on the verge of extinction with only the side branch members surviving somehow.</p><p><br></p><p>The Zagan House was a different matter altogether. They were ranked King. That's only below the Great King and that was for a reason - The Clan Trait of the Zagan House, Life Magic.  This allowed them to create life which had only been done by one other Devil before them, the Mother of all devils, Lilith. They couldn't create devils or any other intelligent lifeforms. They <em>could</em> however create plants and beasts. This made them the core of the food production of the entire Underworld.</p><p><br></p><p>This made them very well off but this fact also came to be their doom.</p><p><br></p><p>The easiest way to cripple an army was to destroy their supplies. The Zagan were thus hunted down to near extinction even through suicidal means by Heaven and the Fallen Angels side. The only ones left were, just like the Buné, members of the Branch Houses. Their Clan Traits were weak and overall the Civil War didn't do them any good either. The Zagan Trait wasn't seen after The Civil Wars. The two last pure blooded High Class Members were my parents.</p><p><br></p><p>My parents in this life didn't inherit the Clan Traits but did inherit all the lands and properties of the two houses. Now, one might wonder why anyone, especially these greedy devils would leave the lands to two weak traitless devils and not just declare everyone extinct. Well, politics and, much more solid reason was that there were no profits to be made.</p><p><br></p><p>The Zagan lands had no mineral reserves and were pure agricultural lands. It had however been reduced to an uninhabitable mess due to the wars and slaughter on them.</p><p><br></p><p>The Buné lands were rocky cliffs and near the pits… The breeding zones of the Demonic Beasts. They were assigned the area by Lucifer because they were fighters by nature, what's with the dragon nature and all. They were meant to be a wall against the demonic beasts of the pits. The lands however were now almost overtaken by the demonic beasts and no house, not even the Great King wanted to dip their fingers in this mess. This was also one of the reasons why houses had signed that these lands would belong to us even if we somehow lost our nobility. The reason given for this was to 'remember our meaningful and honourable contribution to the devil race'.</p><p><br></p><p>What bullshit. </p><p><br></p><p>If they were so grateful, someone could help us through our economic troubles but no one did. My parents had to hunt demonic beasts with their peerages and sell them to pay our servants and maintain our properties. This was also what caused them their deaths around one year ago leaving the previous Mathias alone in the world. The only servant who had served him also left after stealing the remaining expenses of the house.</p><p><br></p><p>The two hundred thousand Liliums I had left were due to the secret stash that the boy had hidden because of the advice given by his mother. The servant had however poisoned the child before running away so as to not get caught. After all, who would know? As long as no one complained against her, she would get off scot free. It would be attributed to a suicide. Too bad for her, I survived. </p><p><br></p><p>Thus, here I was, my body severely weakened due to the poison, with no one to rely on, trying to dig a patch of land to establish my farm and finally start my system.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn't use the points to increase my stats first because the early training periods are supposed to be easier to advance. </p><p><br></p><p>The requirements for the farm was a land of two thousand square metres.</p><p><br></p><p>I put the shovel and hoe down and dropped on my butt as I looked at the tilled land in front of me. After an entire day of work, it's finally complete. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Quest Completed</strong></p><p><strong>[The First Step]</strong></p><p><strong>The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Prepare a piece of land to make your farm.</strong></p><p><strong>Objective: Prepare an area of 2,000m² for your new farm.</strong></p><p><strong>Reward: A bag of F Ranked fertiliser, a bag of F Ranked Seeds, a set of basic farming tools. </strong></p><p><strong>Accept Reward: Yes/No.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I clicked on Yes and the reward was soon deposited in my inventory.</p><p><br></p><p>The land was almost unsuitable for cultivation and I didn't have any idea how to go about it either.</p><p><br></p><p>I could only take things slow and try getting some experience of my own.</p><p><br></p><p>I opened the Farm Management section of the menu.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Farm Rank: E. </strong></p><p><strong>Farm Area: 2,000 m².</strong></p><p><strong>Soil Quality: Uncultivable.</strong></p><p><strong>Seeds Planted: None. </strong></p><p><br></p><p>The soil was uncultivable even in front of my house which was supposed to be a good piece of land.</p><p><br></p><p>I took the fertilisers out from the inventory.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>F Ranked Fertilisers: Raises the quality of 10,000 m² of land to F Rank.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The instructions were thankfully written on the pack. Simply mix with water and spray over the land. This was for 10,000 m², so one fifth. I got the necessary basic farming tools already.</p><p><br></p><p>I was a bit hesitant at using magic for a few reasons. First, training. Second, I wasn't quite used to magic yet and didn't want to mess up the work I had done till now. Third, there were many plants that reacted badly to magic so the use of magic had to be avoided.</p><p><br></p><p>So this meant that I had to get buffed. At least I will get an eight pack out of this.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Scene Change -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I sat on a different part of the field, away from my farm. </p><p><br></p><p>The fertilisers needed a day to work and I was free till then to do as I pleased.</p><p><br></p><p>It was time to practice my magic.</p><p><br></p><p>I decided to start with my Zagan Trait because the Buné Trait needed a stronger physique or… a dragon to work with and I had neither of those at the moment.</p><p><br></p><p>The Trait was at F Ranked which was basically the level of a Low Class Devil. This was to be expected as I was a complete noob at Magic. The House had to sell all their magic books away to maintain the lands. That meant I was on my own when learning magic. The only advantage I had was my Clan' Magic Circles. Both the Houses were Ranked Duke and King and thus possessed very high level Magic Circles which helped me immensely when using Magic. I was using the Zagan Circle as it was slightly higher in quality.</p><p><br></p><p>Imagination was the key to Devil Magic.</p><p><br></p><p>Zagan House Trait was life magic. So, did I need to imagine a plant or animal?</p><p><br></p><p>I didn't think my Demonic Power could support higher level creatures right now.</p><p><br></p><p>So let's start with something small. Hmm, yes that would be good.</p><p><br></p><p>I imagined the creature, barely the size of an adult's palm, its body, the muscles, a rough feel of the creature and pushed… or rather willed my Demonic Power to work.</p><p><br></p><p>A flash of green emanated from my Magic Circle and a wriggling creature appeared from the light. My first creation… was a big… Earthworm.</p><p><br></p><p>I watched the creature wriggle on the land, trying to burrow into the land.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, one might declare an earthworm as useless but these slimy little buggers are quite good for the ground they live in. They dig the soil and somehow make the soil fertile.</p><p><br></p><p>Any creature created by my magic can be controlled by me either directly or by giving them a simple command. The later one is obviously more basic, like staying within a certain area, attack and such. This is however enough for the work I need.</p><p><br></p><p>I tried the spell a couple of times and soon had a dozen strong brigade of earthworms at my behest to dig the fields and till the lands while I worked on whatever I wanted.</p><p><br></p><p>I modified them to survive in these lands and gave them a basic command to work on a certain area.</p><p><br></p><p>I needed to grow a certain amount of stuff on my farm as well as have a sufficient amount of prepared area to qualify for the upgrade. The upgrade token however bypasses all these and directly upgrades the farm to the next level depending on the rarity of the Token.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Scene Change -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>It's been two months since I got to this world and started a farm for the System.</p><p><br></p><p>Farm Work is hard.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no other way to say it.</p><p><br></p><p>One has to do it themselves to know to appreciate the effort farmers put in.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the fields full of different types of plants in front of me and felt a sense of pride.</p><p><br></p><p>Different coloured plants covered the large expanse of the fields in front of me. The Area of the farm had increased immensely since the start, becoming forty times its initial area at 80,000m². The earthworm squads were now four hundred strong and had several modifications made into them to work more efficiently.</p><p><br></p><p>I also made some guard dogs around the place.  I discovered that at higher levels of the skill, animals gain simple sentience. They still cannot act like hunting packs but they can be trained to do some easy tasks.</p><p><br></p><p>The Farm had a Majestic Water Tree in the middle. This thing alone took 1,000 points to purchase and upgrade with the level of the farm. It continuously produces water and the maximum quantity increases with the increase in the farm size and Level. I had to make a suitable water network for it but it was worth it.</p><p><br></p><p>The Underworld doesn't have any major water bodies and water is mostly produced using magic. This is however water made from demonic power which is not suitable for all kinds of plants and thus I had to make suitable arrangements for this but ultimately it solved the entire water problem of my farm. A fully grown Water Tree is said to be able to provide water to an entire country.</p><p><br></p><p>Also a Water Tree can only grow to B Rank normally.</p><p><br></p><p>This made me realise the ridiculousness of this system.</p><p><br></p><p>A simple Tree from this system can change and affect an entire country and it's not even the highest ranked product in the System. I am waiting to explore the ends of this system one day.</p><p><br></p><p>The other plants were the fire tomatoes, four different types of potatoes, crimson spinach, golden carrots, silver radishes, water lemons, and finally two fields of moon rice and sun wheat. All of these were E Ranked Plants. The Farm’s E Rank Upgrade gave it the function to ignore seasonal requirements for plants.</p><p><br></p><p>It took me a lot of points to buy the seeds and upgrades but I could probably earn more than double the amount from them when the crops grow.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Host: Mathias Buné</strong></p><p><strong>Title: The Penniless Noble, Pure Blooded Devil, The Farmer</strong></p><p><strong>Age: 12 years old. </strong></p><p><strong>Body: E+</strong></p><p><strong>Mind: E+</strong></p><p><strong>Spirit: E+</strong></p><p><strong>Magic: E+</strong></p><p><strong>Luck: E+.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Skills:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Buné Clan Trait:</strong></p><p><strong>Dragon Taming: E</strong></p><p><strong>Dragonification: E</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Zagan Clan Trait:</strong></p><p><strong>Life Magic: E+</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Magic:</strong></p><p><strong>Teleportation: E+</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Farm Management</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Farm Rank: E</strong></p><p><strong>Farming Points: 800</strong></p><p><strong>Money: 80,000Ⱡ</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Shop</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Inventory</strong></p><p><br></p><p>My Stats and Skills have increased too. I didn't need a single point in the Body Stat as it rose from the constant work as well as the Life Magic. I had harvested a batch of salad leaves around a month ago and they turned out to be the same Rank as their seeds at F.</p><p><br></p><p>These things actually enhance the growth of the body when eaten. The person obviously had to exercise to get the effects but the speed of growth is definitely boosted.</p><p><br></p><p>Similarly all these plants have similar effects. For example, the fire tomatoes increases someone's fire affinity but only works till the Rank of the Fruit. An E Ranked Fire Tomato increases the fire affinity of a being slightly for every fruit eaten till the E Rank, basically the level of a Mid Class Devil. Golden Carrots increases the light affinity or resistance depending on who eats them.</p><p><br></p><p>Moreover, these things are absolutely fucking delicious.</p><p><br></p><p>My Stats and Skill levels were however bound to my Farm Level and thus couldn't advance beyond E+ Rank, which was the level of a strong Mid Class Devil. This might change today hopefully because I might be able to get enough points to upgrade the Farm to D Rank when I harvest the crops.</p><p><br></p><p>I have been using up my already meagre funds to support myself somehow and I really needed the cash now. I took a deep breath and got to work.</p><p><br></p><p>Twelve hours later, I sat with a heap of new products. There were several tonnes of Fire Tomato, Golden Carrots, Silver Radishes, Crimson Spinach, and some normal plants. The others will take a while longer to ripen for picking.</p><p><br></p><p>I will however only sell the F Ranked produce for now. Attracting too much attention towards myself doesn’t help me. I stored a fifth of all the produce from the E Rank products and sold the rest to the System Shop. The reward for harvesting one ton of these products of E Rank on an average is 10 points while the Selling Price to the System is ten times that at 100 points. I had sold around eighty eight tonnes of E Ranked products to the System, netting me a total of around 10,000 points in total.</p><p><br></p><p>Farming Points: 10,460.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Upgrade Quest: To Upgrade the Farm to D Rank, </strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>&gt; Make 100 tonnes of produce</strong></p><p><strong>&gt; Have a Farm of 5 Hectares(50,000m²).</strong></p><p><strong>&gt; Plant and Harvest 5 E Ranked produce.</strong></p><p><strong>Cost: 10,000 Farming Points.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I completed the quest and saw my Points drop by a whole ten thousand points to four hundred and sixty.</p><p><br></p><p>I pushed my last bit of points towards making my Luck, Spirit and Magic to D- Rank.</p><p><br></p><p>This barely qualifies me as a High Class Devil.</p><p><br></p><p>The reason I wanted to achieve this now was because tomorrow was the day I had to get tested for my Clan Trait and if I succeed, get my Evil Pieces.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t just go around Farming my entire day for these last two months. In the meantime, I read about anything I could find.</p><p><br></p><p>The previous Mathias also had this memory that he was supposed to go to Lilith, the Capital of the Underworld for taking the test. His parents however didn’t have much hope though because his Clan Trait was barely at the Level of a Low Class Devil which might have surfaced in the later years after his parent’s death and he didn’t train because he didn’t even know about it.</p><p><br></p><p>The city of Lilith or rather New Lilith as it was called now was a city where the current Satan Lucifer lived. Yes, Sirzechs Lucifer lived in New Lilith which was made after the old capital was destroyed in the previous war. He managed Internal Affairs which included these matters. The main office of the Internal Matters which oversaw the tests for the heirs of nearly extinct clans was carried out in the same building where his office was because this was a matter of utmost importance that could determine the future of a House. I was an already established Heir but if I didn’t have the Clan Traits, the Clans would be declared extinct with me because that would make two successive generations without anyone awakening the Clan Trait and thus the Magic would have been considered lost officially.</p><p><br></p><p>In the past month, I had somehow learned the Teleportation Spell which was taught to the previous owner of the body.</p><p><br></p><p>I also plan to use this time to sell my products, well the less attractive ones to the market and make some money if possible.</p><p><br></p><p>As for my ID Proof, my Clan Magic Circle was more than enough.</p><p><br></p><p>Apparently my Clans had some shops which were more or less closed since my parents’ passing away. They couldn’t move or sell properties like those without my express signature or I am pretty sure those fuckers would have tried to swindle off those places too. I need to check those places if I want to make a shop there in the future.</p><p><br></p><p>But first things first, I need to get myself some of those cool Evil Pieces.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Sirzechs Lucifer -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs was quite excited about today. He could bring his cute sister in to show her where he worked. She wanted to visit and he obviously agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>Coincidentally, both Sona and Serafall had been there too and she decided to show her sister the place as well and thus, here the Satan Lucifer stood, waiting for his cute sister to arrive.</p><p><br></p><p>“Onii-sama, onii-sama.” He turned around to see the cute little Ria-tan speeding towards him followed by Sona.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ria-tan, come give Onii-sama a hug.” he opened his arms but was met with surprising news instead of a hug.</p><p><br></p><p>“Some people were bullying a boy on the lower floors. Quick, help us.” Right behind her, Sona also nodded in agreement.</p><p><br></p><p>Bullying someone in the workplace of a Satan?</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, since my cute Ria-tan has asked me to, I will definitely have to take a look.” After all, the people hired in this place had to meet certain standards. How can someone bully others?</p><p><br></p><p>He walked down or rather was dragged by his adorable sister towards the lower floor.</p><p><br></p><p>On reaching said place, he found a very confusing scene.</p><p>“Then at least tell me why I am not allowed to take the test? I believe it is the law that any Clan Devil can take the test between the ages of twelve and fourteen. The only way this can be overturned is if the Clan Head themself bar the candidate from taking the exam, in which case they have to submit a written notice with their own Clan Crest and Magical Signature or if the Satans themselves for whatsoever reason bar the candidate to take the exam and even then they need to provide a suitable explanation for that. I am fine if you don’t want to let me take the exam but I need the reason with suitable proof. I am not leaving till I get that.” He saw a boy, around twelve with reddish hair and golden eyes arguing with the clerk.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy wore plain clothes that would probably be worn by Mid Class Devils that said his manner of speaking was clearly different from normal devils.</p><p><br></p><p>“As I told you already, you can’t take the test. Now get out and stop creating a scene before I get you thrown out of here.” the clerk almost snarled, making Sirzechs frown. The whole argument had created quite a scene.</p><p><br></p><p>This was not the behaviour he expected from any of his employees.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is going on here?” he stepped forward asking the clerk who looked taken aback at his arrival.</p><p><br></p><p>“I-it’s nothing, Sir. I was just about to clear the mess. I apologise for creating a scene here.” he stuttered but Sirzechs looked towards the boy who was actually looking at him, and surprisingly in the eye. Very few people were able to meet eyes with him when talking to him due to his strength and position and sometimes both, let alone a small child.</p><p><br></p><p>The child however bowed slightly like a proper Noble.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is your name?” he asked the boy.</p><p><br></p><p>“My name is Mathias Buné, Sir,” he replied.</p><p><br></p><p>A Buné. Dragonification and Dragon Taming. Frontline fighters in the Great War and almost extinct. Keepers of the Pit Number Eight of the Underworld. He recalled everything he could about the house from off the top of his head. The Bunés hadn’t been a part of the Noble Circle for hundreds of years due to various reasons and it was easy for even a Satan like him to forget somethings. “What exactly is the matter, Mathias? Can I call you that?” He asked the boy who nodded politely.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am here to take my Clan Trait Test, Sir. Also I believe I am of age and can qualify to receive my own Evil Pieces if I did that. I was however not allowed to take the exam and not even given a proper reason for that and thus I was asking for an explanation. I am sorry if I made an inconvenience for you or your work from this.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No no, that’s alright. May I ask what your Father’s name is?”</p><p><br></p><p>“My Father’s name was Lord Morton Bune, Sir.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Lord Morton? Was?” Sirzechs asked, surprised at the new reveal by the young boy.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, Sir. He went on a hunt near the Pits a year and two months ago and hasn't returned since. He was the last Lord of the House and since then no one else had qualified for the position so I am even more surprised how anyone would bar me from taking the examination.” The boy replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“I’m sorry to remind you of the bad memories. You and your mother must be devastated.” he patted the boy’s head while trying to recall the Lord. he did remember the rarely seen man although vaguely. He rarely came to any gatherings but still, the death of a House Head would have been notified to him. Did the mother keep it a secret for safety?</p><p><br></p><p>“I… Sir, my mother was with my father that day. They both haven’t returned since then and neither have any of their peerage members.” The boy replied, making Sirzechs freeze suddenly.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the boy incredulously and then with the corner of his eyes at the clerk who was sweating profusely. Alarm bells rang in his mind as he thought of the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tell me, who has taken care of you since then? When did your parents go missing?” He asked the boy. A Clan Head, even someone with a nearly extinct clan, was an important member of the already dwindling Pure Blooded Devil population. Pits may be a dangerous place but an experienced man like a Clan Head wouldn’t be foolish enough to suddenly venture into the more dangerous areas. One might say that accidents still occur, although he might have an accident if alone, it was impossible for him, his wife and their entire peerages to be killed. Teleportation Spells worked and they could easily flee against dangerous enemies and save their lives. If none of them returned, then there was a fair chance that something else was going on.</p><p><br></p><p>The face of the clerk was giving him bad vibes too. It was his instinct as someone working in such a position that was telling him that something was up in this situation.</p><p><br></p><p>“I was taken care of by a maid till two months ago. She… might have…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Speak, you don’t need to fear anyone.” he spoke, assuring the boy.</p><p><br></p><p>“I was poisoned about two months ago. My body however somehow fought the toxins off. I think it might have something to do with the Buné Clan Trait but when I woke up, the maid was gone along with many expensive things from the house. It took me a while to fully recover and the first thing I did was come here to take the test to get my Evil Pieces as a means of self protection.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs clenched his jaws and looked at the clerk who was trying to act as if he knew about nothing. “Why were you stopping him from taking the exam?”</p><p><br></p><p>“T-that Sir. This child is a liar, Sir. he had already come here once for the test with his maid and didn’t qualify. Since then he keeps making a scene.” the man pointed towards the child.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy on his part looked shocked at the reveal. “What do you mean I already came here and took the tests? I haven’t been here before. In fact I haven’t even been to Lilith since I was eight. What nonsense are you talking about?” He retorted towards the man who glared at the boy briefly and then stopped after turning in his direction.</p><p><br></p><p>“You haven’t been to this place before?” Sirzechs asked, confused. “What about your stipend?”</p><p><br></p><p>“What stipend?” he asked, returning his confusion back.</p><p><br></p><p>“A High Class Devil Child in case their parents pass away and there is no direct relative to take care of them, receive a stipend from the Government till they come of age. If they have their Clan Traits active, the stipend is four times the normal. Did you not collect the stipend?” he asked.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy’s hung mouth gave him the answer he needed. At this point, if he still needed to figure out the situation, he wasn’t fit to be a Satan who ruled over the entire Devil population.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked towards other staff members, “Get him the files of the Orphans and their stipends as well as the test files for Mathias Bune. Also someone, take that devil in for questioning.”</p><p><br></p><p>The files were brought within minutes and it took him a few more to confirm that the stipend of 100,000 Liliums was collected every month, including this one. The guardian was signed as Cordela Namrek.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy confirmed her to be his maid or rather his former maid.</p><p><br></p><p>Another unexpected coincidence was that the last name of the Clerk was also Namrek. The maid was his wife. The test files had fake magical signatures for the candidate and that was the final nail in the coffin. These people were running a scam and were involved in many crimes that might include the poisoning of an Heir of a Pillar House.</p><p><br></p><p>This headache will be a pain in the neck to solve.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the boy who was sitting in a corner of the room being stared at by Ria-tan and Sona looking a bit uncomfortable by their gazes. He hadn’t flinched at him but was avoiding the gazes of other children? Or perhaps it was their questions that were making him avoid their gazes. It was hard to believe that he was staying in that territory, all alone. He knew of the place. It was a barren land and even the residents of the territory lived only near the borders due to the demonic beasts from the pits.</p><p><br></p><p>And in that piece of hell, this young child was living all by himself.</p><p><br></p><p>A staff member came in and informed him that the exam venue was prepared. It was better to take care of the situation on his own.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mathias, come on. It is time for your test.” he got up and directly teleported the group into the fields. “Go on. You need to exhibit the Trait of your Clan as well as you can. The rest of the paperwork has already been taken care of by me. You don’t need to worry about that. Just go in there and give it your best shot.” he patted the boy on the back.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy stepped forward but turned back towards him. “Sir, which Clan Trait should I exhibit?”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the boy confused.</p><p><br></p><p>“I mean the Dragon Tamer Trait cannot be shown without a Dragon and I can only partially dragonify, right now. But I can use my Mother’s Clan’s Trait. I think I am also the last member of her Clan.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Your mother?”</p><p><br></p><p>“She was a member of the Zagan Clan. Her name was Selena Zagan. I can use both Buné and Zagan Clan Traits and I am technically the Heir of both the houses because there are no other surviving members of the two Clans. I mean there is a cousin of mine from the Buné Clan but he is a half Devil and from a further branch than me.”</p><p><br></p><p>A Zagan? Sirzechs reeled in shock. He had seen the file but his mother was using the Buné name and not Zagan.</p><p><br></p><p>Didn’t they go extinct already?</p><p><br></p><p>The Zagan were… His eyes widened as he remembered the Clan Trait of the Zagan, one of the Kings of Hell and probably the most elusive of all the Kings, a Trait directly opposite of his own and one that was held at almost the same level of respect. A power so feared that one of the Archangels of Heaven, Saraqiel made a suicidal attack and took down Victus Zagan with himself. Since then both Angels and the Fallen had been extremely vicious towards the Zagan and had done anything and everything in their power to remove every trace of the Clan from all of history.</p><p><br></p><p>The only remaining members were too weak and finally lost the use of their traits and the Clan was declared extinct.</p><p><br></p><p>It had been a massive blow to the devils who had lost the biggest food producer as well as the source of the largest sum of cannon fodders in the form of monsters created by Life Magic.</p><p><br></p><p>It was something that they still hadn’t recovered from as even now 40% of the devil’s food was being imported from the other factions. Except for certain crops the Underworld was bad for cultivating plants.</p><p><br></p><p>“Can you use the Zagan Trait?” He asked the boy with some excitement. A single Zagan High Class Devil could probably reduce the import of products by a whole lot if what he knew of their abilities was true.</p><p><br></p><p>“I can. Although I am not an expert or anything at it. I am self taught and the books were all sold or rather stolen by the servants as I now realise. I had to experiment and learn by myself.”</p><p><br></p><p>Another thing to keep in mind. He will have to torture those frauds to get the information about the books.</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded at the boy to continue and saw him closing his eyes. A green Magic Circle lit up the floor under him and Sirzechs recognized it as the Zagan Magic Circle. The rune at the centre made it clear that this was the crest of the Lord. The Magic Circles for Pillar Family Members were made in such a way that it can be controlled by the Lord who can even remotely remove it from any member. It however had another function. The Heir’s Magic Circle was made in such a way that if the Lord passed away, it would change and he would be able to control everything. It was made during times of war to keep track of things and dissuade any disputes regarding succession.</p><p><br></p><p>The green light gathered at his feet and when the shine passed away, there were two rabbits, one Crimson and another Blue at his feet nuzzling on his body.</p><p><br></p><p>He felt his breath stuck at the sight. It was the creation of life, a complete antithesis of his own power. He stepped forwards and checked those two rabbits who looked at him with a bit of fear, perhaps recognizing his energy however with a single touch from the boy they nuzzled into his palm easily. The spells verified that they were not summoned here, not that a child of that age would be able to bypass the barriers on the place and summon anything inside. Actually there were very few people who were keyed into the wards of the place and these were the strongest wards of the entire underworld.</p><p><br></p><p>“Woah, how did you do that?” he heard his sister speak from behind him looking curiously at the bunny.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy looked smug which was adorable in its own right. “I eat my veggies everyday.”</p><p><br></p><p>Despite his seriousness and composure, at the situation, Sirzechs found himself snorting a laugh at the reply.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh? But veggies are not tasty, you know. I don’t like veggies at all.” Rias replied with a scrunched face.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s because you must be eating those common veggies. I eat the veggies I grow on my own and they are the best tasting things you will ever eat anywhere.” He puffed his chest while Sirzechs caught something else entirely in the statement.</p><p><br></p><p>“You grow your own food?” he asked the boy who nodded in reply.</p><p><br></p><p>“I do. I learned to do so in the last few months after… well, you know.” he whispered, wincing a little.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, he did know. And he would make sure that those involved would know just as well what they were or rather almost did and just what it was that the entire underworld would have lost because of it. They will understand it very well.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy however shook his head and continued, “I made a farm of my own and plan to continue it. In fact I came here to take the test and sell some of my produce for some cash.”</p><p><br></p><p>Cash. Ah, yes. He didn’t get the stipend. “You don’t have to worry about money. Your stipend, including the ones stolen, will all be delivered to you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s fine. I just wish to expand this as my family business in the future. The farm also lets me experiment with my own magic as well as train my body to withstand my Dragonification. It would be a waste to give up on it.” he argued.</p><p><br></p><p>“That is a well thought out plan and I am not telling you to give up on it either. But you will have to consider going to school. As a proper High Class Pillar Devil, a future head of two houses too, you need to learn the basic etiquette and rules of our society.” He explained to the child who looked quite thoughtful.</p><p><br></p><p>“Can I hire a tutor for those? I don’t think I can give up on my farm because the plants there need regular care. They would die if not taken care of properly.”</p><p><br></p><p>Again with the farm? He found the boy quite dedicated to his farm which although strange, the devils were often filled with eccentric people. He himself was one of them as were all the other Satans. That said, he had the boy just where he needed. A tutor was exactly what he was going to suggest after this.</p><p><br></p><p>The Underworld was a political mess with the Great King faction, the almost invisible but still lurking Old Satan faction, the supporters of Archduke Agares and finally the New Satans. Among these, The New Satans and the Great King faction were the major players due to the economic grasp of the Great King faction on the underworld. That said, if the Satans got someone like this child, a boy with the blood of King Zagan and Duke Bune, someone who might be able to grasp the food industry of the entire underworld by its neck, they might have more leeway to get many of the revolutionary laws passed. This however needed the boy to be on their side and thus the tutor that he wanted to suggest would be someone close to them.</p><p><br></p><p>Normally that would be his mother but the Gremory’s ties with the Bael would allow Zekram to exploit the connection and that was a no go. He will need the Zagan Trait of the boy to be kept a secret for a while. Maybe he can ask Ajuka and Serafall for help with this matter. Maybe Lady Sitri or even Ajuka’s sister?</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, a tutor is not out of the question. I will need some time to arrange for one. Normally in this case, a noble Lady accepts you as an apprentice and you are taught by them. This allows them to establish a good relation with a rising Pillar and form future political connections. I will ask around and hand you a list of candidates who would agree to take you as a student.”</p><p><br></p><p>He saw the boy frown a little and raised an eyebrow.</p><p><br></p><p>“I… am not fond of politics. I just want to work in peace and train my Clan Magic.”</p><p><br></p><p>He found a smile on his face at the reply. It was very similar to what Ajuka had said when they were kids, or to be honest the dream he once had too, becoming a musician. The way things work, though…</p><p><br></p><p>“You are still young, and while you might dislike something, it doesn’t mean it is not important. A little secret,” He leaned near the boy’s ears, “I don’t like politics either.” he whispered. “But it never hurts to learn.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm.” the boy nodded his head in agreement.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well then, show me the test for your Buné Trait, you can just show the Dragonification part and we will be done.”</p><p><br></p><p>The test was completed without a hitch. The boy could only do a partial Dragonification but even that was self learned. He was a talented child.</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay, now let’s go to my room and you can show me the things you want to sell. I would love to see the best tasting veggies in the Underworld.” He teleported everyone back to the office room but not before an instruction towards the head examiner to bring everyone who witnessed the test to a different room and isolate them.</p><p><br></p><p>He would need to erase their memories to keep the matters secret.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Scene Change -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“So, this cutie made all these things?” Serafall asked him, looking at the plates of vegetables placed in front of them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. I had to ask him for these to have them tested before they could be sold.” He took a bite of the salad in front of him and had to agree with the boy’s claims of this being the best vegetables in the Underworld. He would have bought these even without the special attributes of these new vegetables.</p><p><br></p><p>“Could the first Zagan or any for that matter make anything like… well, this?” Falbium asked, looking at the seemingly simple plate of salad.</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t know. But if he did, I can see why Heaven would send an Archangel on a suicidal mission to take him down before the Great War. Unfortunately the first Zagan had perished before even our parents were born, actually being the first one to be killed and we don’t have any information about him. The ones who still know about his powers are the old devils and they need to be kept out of this. They would eat a poor child like Mathias.” he replied.</p><p><br></p><p>They looked at the final Satan in the room.</p><p><br></p><p>“Or it could be a mutation like…” Ajuka left the words unsaid and that only made matters worse.</p><p><br></p><p>Another one of their kind.</p><p><br></p><p>Super Devil is the last tag he would want on the boy’s head above everything else.</p><p><br></p><p>He shook his head and looked at Ajuka, “What did you find out about these? Are they safe? Do they have any side effects?”</p><p><br></p><p>Ajuka shook his head, “No. The products were completely safe, including the two rabbits he gave to your sisters. The food products each have different effects. The lettuce enhances the cell activity and increases the growth of physical strength of the body, essentially promoting the physique. The others had slight effects on increasing the elemental affinity of different elements. It was very little but still present nonetheless. My estimates are that if someone eats these for a decade or two, they can be attuned to those elements and have a much easier time with the magic of the element.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What about those light and holy element ones?” Falbium asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Those two would really cause the Angels and the Fallen to go for another suicide attack on the child. He could understand why he wanted to keep those things secret.</p><p><br></p><p>“I would need to test those on criminals but from my estimate, those should increase resistance, although they will not give any devils any affinity with the element if they don’t already have it.” Ajuka replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did he tell you how many he could prepare in a short period of time?” Falbium asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I forbade him from producing them for the time being. To be honest, the boy wouldn’t have revealed even the elemental ones if I hadn’t used slight hypnotism when I brought him for a physical checkup to see if he had any existing injuries from the poison. He intended to keep them all secret until he was strong enough. It is better if we keep this under wraps for now. The internal devil factions will be enough to deal with. We don’t need to involve other factions in this.” he declared. He could see Falbium’s disappointment and understood it too. He was the one incharge of the armies and such a thing would be a boon for any devil army. But this matter needed to be kept hidden for now.</p><p><br></p><p>He did feel guilty getting things out of the boy by using hypnotism but he couldn’t afford not to, given the situation. He even had to erase and modify the memories of his sister while Serafall did it for her own. Any and all members who had witnessed the demonstration had their memories modified by Ajuka and changed so that they only remember the Buné Trait being exhibited. The files were all kept directly under him and couldn’t be accessed by anyone without his direct permission.  As compensation, he assigned the boy double the normal stipend and any books on magic that he wanted through an access to one of his libraries managed by his bishop Mathers.</p><p><br></p><p>He let out a sigh. The things he did for this job. He didn’t lie when he said that he didn’t like politics but if he left the current devil society to those old devils, the entire race will face another civil war in less than a decade.</p><p><br></p><p>“That was a good decision.” Serafall agreed. “I cannot imagine having to explain it to the other factions if they somehow found out about it. Anyways, did you find out anything about the maid and the clerk? And what about the peerage members of his parents? The whole situation smells fishy to me. Two peerages of veteran hunters couldn’t be wiped out so easily. The cutie had the sign of the Head of the Clans on both his Magic Crests so it meant that both those Heads were dead. The peerage members however remained unaccounted for. These two incidents could be connected.”</p><p><br></p><p>“They are still being questioned. The clerk was the husband of the maid. They were stealing the child’s stipend for over a year along with many of the remaining relics of the two Clans and selling them in the black market. The maid was actually afraid when the boy turned twelve and wanted to get his Trait checked. Such a test would have definitely been reported to me because it involved the matters of a Pillar House or even two. She in her panicked state poisoned the boy and tried to make the scene as if a suicide. The child’s Buné Trait helped him survive the attack. Dragons are resistant to most general poisons. She however claims to know nothing about him knowing or even possessing Clan Traits or Magic for that matter. I have sent Mathers and Souji to find and recover those relics and books although it might be nigh impossible with how much time passed. The books or remaining relics might hold some emotional value for the kid and might help get his favour.” He even liquefied the properties of the clerk and maid and moved it to the Buné accounts as well as gave the boy a Phenex Tear as an apology for his staff’s actions. </p><p><br></p><p>The Phenex Tear would probably help save his life if he found himself in such a situation every again.</p><p><br></p><p>It would also work as a way of explanation for anyone who found out that a Clan Heir and now the Clan Head was not only robbed but also poisoned and nearly murdered by the someone working in his own office.</p><p><br></p><p>A scandal that would be.</p><p><br></p><p>“The peerage members?” Falbium asked.</p><p><br></p><p>He shook his head, “I have no idea.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, I will send some people to see if they can be found. I would directly declare them rogue but you want this news suppressed for now, so…”</p><p><br></p><p>“No, do as you think would be right.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So, an important question? Who will you send to guard the cutie?” Serafall asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am thinking of contacting Mephisto Pheles. He could send someone under the guise of teaching him magic along with another student. It was the most I could think of without directly disclosing my own interest.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Tannin? Although with the Buné Trait, it would be understandable.” Falbium nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“But wouldn’t that disclose the cutie’s information to Mephisto? Although he is not fond of the old devils, wouldn’t it be a risk?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t have anyone else. Tannin can station dragons in the area to protect him and they can push it off to making possible relations with the former Dragon King and a Pillar Devil.”</p><p><br></p><p>They quieted down in thought. It was Ajuka who broke the silence</p><p><br></p><p>“I might know of someone. She would be perfect for the job but she might not be suited as a teacher.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Who?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Tiamat.”</p><p><br></p><p>As prepared as he was for the reply, Sirzechs still found his mouth open slightly.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Mathias Buné -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Man, that was crazy. Who knew that bitch was even stealing from my stipend?</p><p><br></p><p>At least she got what she deserved.</p><p><br></p><p>I was a pretty forgiving guy but that bitch tried to kill or rather did kill a child, devil or not doesn’t matter. That’s where I draw the line. She and her fucking husband would get everything they deserved.</p><p><br></p><p>I earned quite well for everything too.</p><p><br></p><p>But revealing the E Ranked products was a bit of a disappointment. I guess I should have expected better than to get away with hiding information from a fucking Satan.</p><p><br></p><p>The second part was me not knowing exactly <em>how</em> big the Zagan name actually was. The change in Sirzechs face and the entire facade slipped for a moment.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not that good at reading people, not that I care. Not many people can do that. But my enhanced senses did help me notice the difference a little.</p><p><br></p><p>I guess amping up my luck was definitely worth it.</p><p><br></p><p>He was actually helping me hide my powers. I know it is for some political reason but this goes on with what I want for myself.</p><p><br></p><p>Let them play their political games. I will spend my time farming vegetables.</p><p><br></p><p>I took this opportunity to check my Stats once more.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Host: Mathias Buné</strong></p><p><strong>Title: The Poor Noble, Pure Blooded Devil, The Farmer</strong></p><p><strong>Age: 12 years old. </strong></p><p><strong>Body: E+</strong></p><p><strong>Mind: E+</strong></p><p><strong>Spirit: D-</strong></p><p><strong>Magic: D-</strong></p><p><strong>Luck: D-</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Skills:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Buné Clan Trait:</strong></p><p><strong>Dragon Taming: E</strong></p><p><strong>Dragonification: E</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Zagan Clan Trait:</strong></p><p><strong>Life Magic: E+</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Magic:</strong></p><p><strong>Teleportation: E+</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Farm Management</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Farm Rank: D</strong></p><p><strong>Farming Points: 76</strong></p><p><strong>Money: 20,80,000Ⱡ</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Shop</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Inventory</strong></p><p><br></p><p>My Farming Points looked the lowest I had ever seen them but my money column was beyond what I was hoping to get anytime soon.</p><p><br></p><p>The best part however was the box I had in my hands.</p><p><br></p><p>A simple wooden box containing my Evil Pieces. And by the Satans, they were stunning.</p><p><br></p><p>I even got a Mutation Piece, a bishop, which later made me want to bang my head. I should have gone for the test later on with a much higher Luck Stat. Maybe I could have gotten two or even more Mutation Pieces if that was even possible though.</p><p><br></p><p>I just increased my Spirit and Magic Power because I was worried that I would need that in the test. I lucked out however with my set being directly handed to me by Ajuka Beelzebub who came to ask me about my product. I Even found out some interesting things. The products that I grow in my farm cannot be grown by anyone outside. The plants just didn’t grow. They had seeds and everything else was fine. I was happy with this because it meant that no one could stand against me as a competitor in the agriculture industry. They attributed it to my Zagan Clan Trait but I knew better. My Farm System was the best. How can such effects be produced by common people?</p><p><br></p><p>I checked my System and the new parts of the D Ranked Farm.</p><p><br></p><p>I had been in a bit of a hurry and didn’t check the features of the Farm upgrade.</p><p><br></p><p>Apart from the usual unlocked seeds and equipment, the special feature of the D Ranked Farm was the Pet or rather Ranch Feature. It was similar to the Farm System but I needed to buy the eggs or the young beasts and raise them myself. There was also the need to provide food for them and stronger beings needed specific types of food and environments.</p><p>I will have to either make or buy places for them to live from the System and looking at some of the animals, I am inclined to say that I will need to buy them.</p><p><br></p><p>Oh yeah, another buttload of grinding for me.</p><p><br></p><p>I need to grow the feed for these animals first before trying to raise them and thus started another cycle of the grind.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Interlude -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>In a room full of white, two beings sat watching several monitors.</p><p><br></p><p>If Mathias had been here, he would have identified one of them as the guy who gave him the System or simply, Paperwork Guy.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, that’s the new member you choose.” The other asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. He seemed almost… Refreshing compared to all those wannabes we meet everyday. They still don’t realize that we can read their minds and even see the future and it’s almost funny to sit in front of them, pretending to do paperwork while hearing them cuss at me in their minds while keeping a straight face when I ignore them. Self entitled little brats. This one however… This was the first time someone wished I got a vacation hahahaha. I really had the urge to laugh at the moment, not at the fact that he said it but because he truly meant it.” The Paperwork Guy laughed before picking up a glass from the table in front of them and drinking. “I read his files, a very calm and easygoing and forgiving type of guy who doesn’t like trouble.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That was evident when he stopped cursing you only two days after realising what you gave him. He adapted quite quickly and I even felt that he didn’t really hold any malice towards you. At best he wanted to punch your face once and then get back to work. I don’t think he even realized but he had accepted the System already. I know of several people who would have sworn eternal feud against you for such a thing.” He replied before looking at one of the screens. “Another one dead. Do these idiots really think that getting a Gamer System makes them Gods? Thinking with their dicks kills half of them while the other half are killed by their set preconceived notions and in ‘Meta Knowledge’ of the world, that everything will be exactly what they know or think of. What’s even the point of things if all the Worlds are exactly the same? A single fly can make changes to the entire world, a single sperm reaching its destination faster can cause the so called main character to not even be born, completely fucking up the entire world and yet these utter idiots take away major parts of the story while still believing that the so called ‘plots’ in their minds will remain the same.It is frustrating to even think that they believe that there will be a ‘plot’ since the moment they take their first breath in the world. The new kid you chose was at least better in this regard. He never once even bothered with his knowledge of things, only taking them with a heavy grain of salt.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Wow, that was a long rant. I take it the guy who died had to do something with it?” The Paperwork Guy sipped the wine.</p><p><br></p><p>“He was one of those Gamer System self entitled brats as you call them. Reincarnated in the Naruto world and started acting like he was hot shit, his behaviour pattern changes were noticed and monitored, showed the signs of knowing what he shouldn’t and before he could realize it, he was shipped into the T&amp;I. The couldn’t get past his mental defences due to the Gamer’s Mind, was given a location based cursed seal and when he tried to escape using the ID Create upon waking up, his head burst open and he was eliminated. He didn’t even last a complete week in the world and these people dream about conquering the world making Kaguya a cock-sleeve, a bunch of morons.

I had no combat experience to speak of and the best case scenario I could think of would be shifting my attributes to sneak in a quick hit at a weak spot.</p><p><br></p><p>I did have some spells and even prepared a few in advance. It still depended on what kind of beast I would be facing.</p><p><br></p><p>The wait didn’t last long as a magic circle summoned the demonic beast a good distance from me.</p><p><br></p><p>The first thing that came to my mind on seeing the beast was… damn, it was ugly.</p><p><br></p><p>It looked like a rhinoceros but bigger. Its skin was thick and spiked. Yellow eyes stared at everything around as if waiting for the restraints to disappear to charge forward and crush them under its massive hooves.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ready.” I heard the examiner call.</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>In my mind, I already made a basic plan of attack.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a land based demonic beast so take to the sky. That would stop most of its attacks. I don’t know if it can still use ranged attacks so keep a healthy distance to dodge in case I need it.</p><p><br></p><p>And as expected, as soon as the beast was released, it charged towards me.</p><p><br></p><p>I took to the sky in a moment and shot a volley of spells towards it.</p><p><br></p><p>Every spell missed the beast and hit the ground beside it but I couldn’t help but smile.</p><p><br></p><p>The very next moment, the ground under it crashed into a deep pit with at least 20 metres depth. The beast roared.</p><p><br></p><p>I used the second spell, one that was the most basic spell used by the low class devils.</p><p><br></p><p>A spell to create water to fill the hole.</p><p><br></p><p>The roars increased in volume and the ground around the pit shook from the beast struggling and hitting the walls.</p><p><br></p><p>The roars soon got quiet as it was drowned in the water.</p><p><br></p><p>All I needed to do was wait out for a few minutes for it to suffocate and die.</p><p><br></p><p>Once done, I looked up and gave a thumbs up to the crowd now looking at the scene with a  deadpan.</p><p><br></p><p>I walked towards them and Miss Maya greeted me. “Mr. Rimmon, first of all congratulations. You have passed your second test. Before you take your last test, could you perhaps tell me why you chose the spells you did to take down the Demonic Beast?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Because it was the most efficient case. I was told to take down the beast. No methods were mentioned. I wasn’t told if the Demonic Beast would be used after I took it down or not, so I decided to err on the side of caution in case I lost any marks for making a mess and reducing the price of the body. Again, in case it was a case of fighting, I would prefer to keep my more dangerous spells to myself and not exhibit them publicly for show.”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at me for a moment and then nodded. “Very good. Let’s proceed on to the next test. Please show me two spells of your creation. The better the spells, the more the chances of you being picked by a senior magician as a student or even an apprentice, so don't hold back.” she patted my back and I stared at her for a second more than necessary before realising and then quickly nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>Apprenticeship. This was not mentioned before.</p><p><br></p><p>I did read about this before. Apprentices were treated much better than normal students and given much more resources. They were basically the elites among students.</p><p><br></p><p>“What does an Apprenticeship entail?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“It will mainly be people reading about your demonstration and deciding if they want to take you as an apprentice. An Apprentice gets better resources than normal students of the same level and are nurtured with a lot more care because they are considered to have more potential. In general, the restrictions that your rank imposes on you for learning things, are far more relaxed if you can become an apprentice of a High Class Magician or if you are lucky, someone even higher.”</p><p><br></p><p>This changed things… a lot.</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded and went back to the field. Miss Maya waved her hand and targets appeared around the place.</p><p><br></p><p>In all this time I had studied mainly Wind Magic.</p><p><br></p><p>But even simple wind magic with some basic knowledge of science can give wonderful results.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the targets in front of me and used the spell I previously made.</p><p><br></p><p>Twenty wind bullets formed, spinning in the air like drills.</p><p><br></p><p>I waved my hand and the bullets rushed, in a direction far away from the targets.</p><p><br></p><p>The bullets whirled past the targets by a large margin but just as everyone thought that the shots were a miss, twenty targets had their heads pierced with bullet holes.</p><p><br></p><p>I let a slight smile appear on my face.</p><p><br></p><p>Mirage Bullets.</p><p><br></p><p>Changing the density of air through heat to bend the light in a way that the real direction of the bullets cannot be seen. It works on the same principle as the formation of mirages in deserts. While that took a very large amount of air to bend the light sufficiently, in this case I had a cheat called Magic.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the crowd and the lady gave me a nod so I went on to the second spell, which was basically a blatant plagiarism.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will need someone to attack me for this next spell. It is a defensive type magic.”</p><p><br></p><p>Miss Maya nodded and almost instantly several whirling bullets of wind formed in the air and I found myself with a hung jaw. She copied me.</p><p><br></p><p>I however didn’t have much time to think as the bullets shot towards me.</p><p><br></p><p>A Magic Circle appeared under my feet and wind spun around me in the form of a sphere/ The bullets stuck the sphere and were deflected instantly. The Spell was inspired from the Hyuga’s Rotation Technique. This however was more of a Counter-Attack Type Magic than a Defensive Type. The sharp winds around me would have shredded anyone to pieces if they had tried to approach me. The consumption was a bit much but it was the best defence I could think of for now.</p><p><br></p><p>My Mirage Bullets cannot be dodged by eyesight alone.</p><p><br></p><p>Still… Did I invent an already created spell of this woman, or did she copy it with just one look?</p><p><br></p><p>Fuck… and she is supposed to be just a High Class Magician.</p><p><br></p><p>I remember the anime and Mid Class Magicians seemed to be the type of cannon fodder who everyone and their grandmothers could beat even after waking up from a bad hangover.</p><p><br></p><p>Am I really that weak?</p><p><br></p><p>Shit.</p><p><br></p><p>I went ahead, but no one spoke anything and Miss Maya just instructed me to complete the rest of the exam.</p><p><br></p><p>The last part of the Exam was to spar with her for a bit. It was mainly to see if I have the overall abilities and skill of a Low Class Magician.</p><p><br></p><p>She walked into the Training Ground in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t hold anything back. Although this examination was made in order to avoid you taking any advantage of your Devil Heritage, it still is an advantage. Giving it up would be the utmost level of foolishness so, don’t hold back. Come at me with the intent to kill, with everything you have got.” She said and I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>And right then I felt her magic pour out of her.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not able to sense Magic that well. I did get the ability after my own Magic Power and Spirit Stats reached a certain level but… this time I didn’t need to. Wisps of bluish purple magic power appeared around her.</p><p><br></p><p>I pushed two hundred points from my Spirit to my Body. I might need to dodge.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Host: Elias Rimmon</strong></p><p><strong>Body: 240</strong></p><p><strong>Mind: 2,000</strong></p><p><strong>Spirit: 2,050</strong></p><p><strong>Magic: 400</strong></p><p><br></p><p>\"Start.\"</p><p><br></p><p>I raced towards Miss Maya several dozen wind bullets forming around me.</p><p><br></p><p>The speed this time was much faster as they raced towards her.</p><p><br></p><p>I am very sure I saw her smirk before my Wind Shell appeared around her. At the same time, I felt my blood chill as hundreds of wind bullets formed around her. Not ones, not tens but fucking hundreds. I tore off another page of my Grimore, activating another spell which I had plagiarised.</p><p><br></p><p>Air Armour. It was used to increase the density of air around the user and change the direction of any light weight projectile shot at the user, including bullets. It just changes the angle of the attack lightly and makes them in a way… slip away from the user.</p><p><br></p><p>The Wind Bullets rained towards me, only to slip away from me. I, in the meanwhile, used the next spell.</p><p><br></p><p>I created the fucking Wind Shell. I would be a fool to not invent a counter for it.</p><p><br></p><p>Two pages of my Grimore were torn and several dozen Wind Bullets formed around me, ready to pour down on her at a moment's notice.</p><p><br></p><p>I could see that smile on her face as she raised the Wind Shell again… annoyingly.</p><p><br></p><p>This time however, the Wind Bullets were not made to attack her but rather to make her activate the Wind Shell.</p><p><br></p><p>Another couple of pages of my Grimore were torn off and a Magic Circle formed around the Wind Shell of Miss Maya.</p><p><br></p><p>Nox Out. A spell that changes the nitrogen and oxygen in the atmosphere to Nitrogen Oxide which is poisonous and can knock out the opponent if inhaled in large quantities.</p><p><br></p><p>It was mainly used in close spaces… but if my opponent was kind enough to make a bubble of high speed spinning wind around her, who am I to not take advantage of it?</p><p><br></p><p>I am not expecting the spell to actually knock her out, just to disorient her a little.</p><p><br></p><p>A single moment of lapse in concentration was enough for me to take advantage of.</p><p><br></p><p>The bombardment of wind bullets continued for around one minute. I was preparing the next step of my attack in the meantime.</p><p><br></p><p>Two spells were set for use.</p><p><br></p><p>Bias Release - a wind spell that compresses air in a certain area to great degrees and releases it in one direction. This can be focused to have greater effects.</p><p><br></p><p>And, Freezing Wind. Compressing the Nitrogen in the air to high pressures to liquefy it. Liquid Nitrogen can instantly freeze an area reaching sub zero temperatures.</p><p><br></p><p>Combine the two spells and I have a Freeze Spray of Instant Death, ready to make a popsicle out of my opponents at a moment's notice.</p><p><br></p><p>Magic is like a software used to hack Nature. If we know well enough what to do, the effects of the magic gets enhanced.</p><p><br></p><p>Still Magicians use Magic in a very raw form. Making icicles and bombing the opponents with it. How wasteful.</p><p><br></p><p>Miss Maya's Wind Shell wavered and I released all my spells almost instantly at her.</p><p><br></p><p>A five metre area around her froze over.</p><p><br></p><p>Mists covered the entire place and it got difficult to see what had happened to her.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly, I dodged to the side and the place I was standing on was bombed by what I recognized as my Bias Release.</p><p><br></p><p>\"The combination was quite good but… don't you have anything better? This much is not good against a High Class Magician.\" I turned towards the voice to see Miss Maya standing in the air.</p><p><br></p><p>She teleported.</p><p><br></p><p>I said nothing. The last few spells took a lot of toll on my Demonic Power reserves. I did however use a move to give a reply.</p><p><br></p><p>A magic circle formed above me as a ball of compressed and spinning wind formed, slowly turning into a shuriken made up of wind.</p><p><br></p><p>She merely stood in her place and watched me use the spell.</p><p><br></p><p>I again waved my hand and the huge spinning ball of death rushed towards the biggest target and showed everyone on the training ground why Naruto Uzumaki could sail through the entire ninja war with just a single technique and its variations.</p><p><br></p><p>The Rasenshuriken's attack struck true. The rocks around her looked as if vapourized. In a way it was true because this attack worked on the cellular level. The only problem with it was the energy required for this. Three Rasenshurikens took almost all of my Demonic Power as a Mid Class Devil. There was also the fact that the attack required a few seconds to prepare and form completely.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, I am pretty sure that anyone, any Mid Class Devil, if hit by this attack would suffer.</p><p><br></p><p>I fell to my knees. This spell took out almost all of my Demonic Power and I didn't want to shift my attributes to give them any hints about my power. If my Demonic Power suddenly increased, it would be suspicious to say the least.</p><p><br></p><p>I saw Berta and Aaron gasping at the attack. It had taken me a lot of work to get the required balance for this particular skill but hopefully this gets me the much needed apprenticeship.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Now, that was something decent.\"</p><p><br></p><p>I heard her voice, just as nonchalant as a second ago from between the dust cloud. A gust of wind blew the dust cloud away and there she stood… Completely unharmed.</p><p><br></p><p>Are High Class Magicians… really this strong?</p><p><br></p><p>The motherfucking anime and Light Novels lied to me.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean sure, I was hiding my power but still… I was using the stats of a Mid Class Devil to fight her.</p><p><br></p><p>She must have sensed my thoughts from my expressions, not that it was hard to do so because for a moment I had stopped giving shit, because she spoke. \"Your power reached a solid Mid Class Level with that attack. Too bad your Demonic Power and Strength needs a lot more training. Your Magic on the other hand was… adequate.\"</p><p><br></p><p>I sat on the ground trying to gather myself.</p><p><br></p><p>She continued. \"Just for a demonstration, this is what a High Class Magician can do.\"</p><p><br></p><p>She raised a hand towards the empty part of the field. A Magic Circle appeared in front of her hand and almost instantly a hurricane rose in the middle of the ground, almost reaching the sky. The sheer sight of the attack was awe inspiring as well as depressing. But, she wasn't done yet. Just when I thought it was over, the entire hurricane was frozen… instantly.</p><p><br></p><p>I felt a chill on my back as I watched the scene.</p><p><br></p><p>\"A High Class being can destroy a village. An Ultimate Class being can destroy cities and provinces. A Leader Class or what you call a Satan Class being can destroy countries. Do not think for a single moment that you are strong just because you have gained some strength. Pride comes before the fall is a very good saying for an obvious reason. Your performance was passable. You will get your detailed results in a week as well as the information about any apprenticeship if you do get accepted by someone. For now, I declare you a Low Class Magician. Congratulations on passing, Mr. Rimmon.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I… thank you.\" I answered slightly absentmindedly, still looking at the gigantic frozen hurricane in the middle of the training ground. My Rasenshuriken was nothing compared to <em>that</em>. None of my attacks were anything compared to that Spell, not even close.</p><p><br></p><p>I took a deep breath and slapped my cheeks and got up.</p><p><br></p><p>Isn't this just the High Class Level?</p><p><br></p><p>I started training a year ago and now I am a Mid Class being all by myself. A few more years. I will reach there.</p><p><br></p><p>With this thought in mind, I got up and bowed to Miss Maya and went to Aaron who gave me a light hug and patted my back with a smile while congratulating me.</p><p><br></p><p>Berta had a slightly complicated look on her face. She still nodded and congratulated me.</p><p><br></p><p>But didn't stay behind for long as she went behind Miss Maya to escort her to the mansion.</p><p><br></p><p>Aaron gave me a check up and led me to my room where I fell asleep as soon as I laid on the bed.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>– Medea –</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Medea watched as Aaron entered the room and bowed slightly. \"How is he?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Elias is completely unharmed, Lady Medea. Perhaps a little exhausted but still unharmed.\" She watched him hesitate a little before gathering his courage and opening up. \"My Lady, he…\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Are you worried about him even after seeing his performance, Aaron?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I… I don't understand this.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Geniuses are rarely understood. And my gem… He might as well be the one who gives the term genius a new definition. Did you see his performance? The spells he created, with only months of self-study. How many others do you know who can achieve the same level of skill in Magic?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I… . didn't even know what some of those spells were or how they worked. I could do similar spells, at least the ice magic but others, I have no idea how they worked\" Aaron said after a while and then looked at Berta who shook her head as well.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Because those spells were not brute forced. You could use the ice magic, but it would take you around 12 times more Demonic Power to achieve the same results. He was using science rather than mysticism, working within the laws of nature rather than against it to achieve the results which greatly reduced his Demonic Power expenditure. Most of his spells were using nature to enhance their power. Thus, you couldn't have copied the spell or done anything even on the same level without knowing the underlying principle. Even I myself couldn't copy his last spell. It was far more complicated than it looked at a simple glance.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Yes. That last attack… it could have destroyed most High Class Devils easily.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"It could have done the same for most Ultimate Class Devils had they been caught off guard and there was more power behind the spell. Even the famed regeneration of the Phenex would have been challenged. That attack was not a single one but rather an uncountable number of small blades attacking the body continuously at the cellular level. Add the flames that the Phenex release during regeneration and the wind attribute of the attack would have made the attack even more dangerous.\"</p><p><br></p><p>She analysed the spell from behind her barrier and got some information about it.</p><p><br></p><p>And to think that he was still holding back… She smiled with sheer anticipation.</p><p><br></p><p>Keeping his cards till it was a matter of life and death. It was an admirable quality. Something that someone in his position would need to survive. She will get him to open up… in time.</p><p><br></p><p>Trust was not earned so easily after all. She of all people understood this fact.</p><p><br></p><p>They kept quiet on hearing the news. The one to break the silence was Berta.</p><p><br></p><p>\"What do we do from now on, My Lady?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Nothing. You will all maintain the illusion about him being a Mid Class Devil at best. I will teach him personally and let him flourish his talents as much as he can.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Yes, My Lady.\"</p><p><br></p><p>She noticed a slight hesitation on Berta's face. She has really grown close to her Gem.</p><p><br></p><p>\"You are not cheating him, Berta. Rather you are doing this to keep him safe. Children of his talents are either recruited or killed. Not to mention if he finds out about his power, he might get cocky. You are just doing what any responsible guardian would do to keep him out of trouble. After all, mothers scaring their child with imaginary monsters and such to keep them from doing mischief is not something new.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Except this time, the monsters would be very real.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Elias -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I woke up from my sleep and looked around my room, only to fall back after remembering yesterday.</p><p><br></p><p>The frozen hurricane at the end of the test was something that had been imprinted on my mind.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at my Status screen to see the current level of my stats.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Host: Elias Rimmon</strong></p><p><strong>Body: 240</strong></p><p><strong>Mind: 2,000</strong></p><p><strong>Spirit: 2,050</strong></p><p><strong>Magic: 400</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I shifted my stats around for the grinding mode.</p><p><br></p><p>I was only learning magic for a few months now and it was just my start. The frozen hurricane might be impressive but one day I will surpass it.</p><p><br></p><p>For now I just need to keep on training.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Host: Elias Rimmon</strong></p><p><strong>Body: 40</strong></p><p><strong>Mind: 500</strong></p><p><strong>Spirit: 4,000</strong></p><p><strong>Magic: 150</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The Spirit stat as I observed, increases my Magic Stat passively. From my guesses, I could deduce that the stronger someone’s soul, the more their magic grows naturally. The greater the difference between my Spirit and Magic stats, the faster the growth and thus when I am not training or studying, I always keep my Spirit Stat at a high level.</p><p><br></p><p>For the same amount of magic training, there can be drastically different results for my growth in Magic Stat, depending on the spirit. I guess, the ones with great talent and such must have very High Spirit Stat and such.</p><p><br></p><p>I got up to get fresh for my training.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Two Years Later -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Three years have passed since my test.</p><p><br></p><p>Three days after my test, I got my results formally. I was accepted in the Gauzaburer’s Magician’s Organisation as a Low Class Magician.</p><p><br></p><p>Surprisingly, I got a mentor as well.</p><p><br></p><p>Miss Maya took me in as an apprentice.</p><p><br></p><p>She told me that while she won’t be taking me with her all the time, she would come every month to keep an eye on my studies and the rest were books.</p><p><br></p><p>The books.</p><p><br></p><p>I have a large shelf full of books in my room all as a courtesy from Miss Maya.</p><p><br></p><p>Everything I would need to study up to the Mid Class level. It also contained some books about other schools of magic such as the Norse and the Greek ones.</p><p><br></p><p>Miss Maya did as she promised me and came every month and stayed for a few days in the mansion and taught me Magic.</p><p><br></p><p>My personal favourite was still the one I started with, The Human Magic System or the Merlinean Magic System.</p><p><br></p><p>It was quite a lot like programming and I remembered a Light Novel Series from my previous life which served as a massive inspiration for my Magic.</p><p><br></p><p>The Irregular at Magic High School.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a <em>big</em> reason for it too.</p><p><br></p><p>The way in which the Merlinean System approached Magic was very slightly reminiscent of that one. The Human Magic System had many types too. The ones Merlin created was just the base or rather the first one of its kind. Later on many others took it and made other styles of magic of their own.</p><p><br></p><p>It was kinda like having different programming languages to do the same thing.</p><p><br></p><p>Many famous magicians had invented their own programming languages for Magic. These were people who created Magician Organisations basically. People like McGregor Mathews and Rudriger Rozencrutz.</p><p><br></p><p>My stats had grown a lot in these two years. It was mainly due to the help of Miss Maya and my newest spell.</p><p><br></p><p>A Wide Area Gravity Concentration Spell, Gravity Field.</p><p><br></p><p>I could understand why they said that Gravity Manipulation was High Class Stuff.</p><p><br></p><p>Manipulating one of the fundamental forces is something else.</p><p><br></p><p>The spell has to be powered continuously by my Demonic Power. It had a great energy requirement too.</p><p><br></p><p>The gravity worked on my entire body at the same time and was much more effective than the weights had been.</p><p><br></p><p>A rough calculation showed that they were almost twice as effective.</p><p><br></p><p>The hardest part about the spell however was the control required over it. The fluctuating input changed the output accordingly too so to keep a stable gravitational field, the user had to keep a stable input as well, which, believe me, is easier said than done.</p><p><br></p><p>Well, no. It <em>can</em> be done easily but my mentor advised me not to.</p><p><br></p><p>According to her, if I was doing this to train myself, I should not add the component to regulate the power.</p><p><br></p><p>This will help me improve my control over my Demonic Power.</p><p><br></p><p>The ones with shitty Magic Circles like me can use this method to close the gap, even if only slightly. I thought about it for a moment and it made sense.</p><p><br></p><p>The difficulty though… I think my mentor might be a closet sadist.</p><p><br></p><p>To put it into words, it was like running an obstacle course with a mad Demonic Beast chasing me while I had to balance a pot of burning lava on my head.</p><p><br></p><p>I couldn’t make a stable field for two months straight.</p><p><br></p><p>The training though… It helped all my stats grow simultaneously.</p><p><br></p><p>The strain from the concentration needed to maintain the stable Gravity field, increased both Mind and Spirit. The push ups in the Gravity field increased my Body and the drain on my Magic to maintain the Gravity Field, increased my Magic Stat.</p><p><br></p><p>It was <em>the best</em> training someone like me could get.</p><p><br></p><p>The results showed this.</p><p><br></p><p>I gain around 6 Stat Points from this method… every hour.</p><p><br></p><p>Currently, I can keep this up for eight hours before fainting but it still nets me 48 points in those eight hours alone.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Host: Elias Rimmon</strong></p><p><strong>Body: 2,000</strong></p><p><strong>Mind: 7,000</strong></p><p><strong>Spirit: 29,230</strong></p><p><strong>Magic: 3,500</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Although she is a slave driver, Miss Maya is a great teacher..</p><p><br></p><p>Like seriously, I thought I was training hard enough but this woman made my previous training look like a child playing around.</p><p><br></p><p>Once I faint from the above training, it takes me around eight hours to wake up. Although, now my body has been getting used to it more.</p><p><br></p><p>After I wake up, she follows it by a spar which is a polite word for a beatdown.</p><p><br></p><p>She used spells created by me in spars mostly so whenever I made a spell, I made it a habit to make counters for them or at least a way to defend against them.</p><p><br></p><p>Later on, she started using her own spells. Magic from several different styles and schools randomly thrown at me.</p><p><br></p><p>One second, I would be dodging summoned demonic spirits, the next second I would be dodging Runic traps on the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>Although, not everything was bad.</p><p><br></p><p>First things first. She’s hot.</p><p><br></p><p>She is probably the prettiest woman I have seen in both my lives. I mean Devils are beautiful in general but she is still above the common rabble.</p><p><br></p><p>Blue hair and elf like slightly pointed ears. She told me that she was a reincarnated Devil who was under the Lucifuge House and was originally from Greece. Although she didn’t tell me the details of anything, even this much was quite a lot.</p><p><br></p><p>Second, after the training is done, she adores me.</p><p><br></p><p>Like, ,<em>really</em> adore me.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, whenever I faint, I get lap pillows from her.</p><p><br></p><p>At the end of the training, we take baths together.</p><p><br></p><p>And outside of training, she never let me go anywhere from her lap. Although my cheeks are poor. And while that was good when I was nine, with my rapidly growing body and puberty, things are not that simple for me anymore. Not that she minded it. She was quite free when with me.</p><p><br></p><p>See did seem a little crazy but hey….every worth their salt is a bit crazy. Moreover….she’s a Devil Magician. And if that was not enough….she’s Greek.</p><p><br></p><p>Recently, she told me that my Demonic Power is barely at the High Class level, although my skills need a lot more work but were average in the Mid Class level.</p><p><br></p><p>3,500 Magic is barely High Class.</p><p><br></p><p>At least, three and a half years in, I am now near the High Class level. She still couldn’t take me out of the Underworld though because apparently I still needed to clear the Mid Class Devil Promotion exams. It sucked but that exam was in a year. I am pretty sure I could make it to the mid levels or even the peak of High Class.</p><p><br></p><p>I also found out something very interesting. Berta was as strong as a High Class Devil. Although only at the starting stage but still.</p><p><br></p><p>In hindsight, it made sense with how she had kicked my ass back in the day.</p><p><br></p><p>It also gave me a measure of how strong a real High Class Devil can be. The maids were all Mid Class Devils and only Berta was stronger as the Head Maid. I did spar with some maids and while they were not very good fighters, their base stats were more or less around 1,000 or so.</p><p><br></p><p>In Devil Society, children were allowed to take some responsibilities after they became twelve. I’m twelve but due to my regular training, I passed for a fifteen year old. This allowed me several leeways. One such thing was exploring the city.</p><p><br></p><p>I often went out for walks around the city. Sometimes even disguising myself to listen to others.</p><p><br></p><p>The Underworld was a lot like the Human World in many aspects. It also had a dark side. Criminal gangs and a Black Market.</p><p><br></p><p>Surprisingly, these were maintained and backed up by the Pillar Houses and Extra Demon Houses.</p><p><br></p><p>These Black Markets had things that wouldn’t see the light of the day normally and even if it did, would not be sold to just anyone, like rare materials, books, equipment, artifacts and even Magic Circles.There were auctions which sold these things. In fact, from the rumours many rare things like Phenex Tears were also sold.</p><p><br></p><p>While my Human Magic was progressing very well, I was still far behind in my Devil Magic. It was after all a part of me and I would be a fool to not utilise it</p><p><br></p><p>The greatest drawback for me to learn Devil Magic would be my Magic Circle. A normal 20% efficiency Magic Circle would cost me all my savings and would still leave me at least four times behind any Pillar Devil who normally has at least 80% efficiency Magic Circles.</p><p><br></p><p>That means, I would need at least 8,000 Magic Stat to be able to barely match the energy expenditure of a barely passable High Class Devil. And that’s not even mentioning the other facilities of a High Level Magic Circle like the spell storage, high casting speed, etc.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the thought of it was depressing. The only way to bypass those are these Black Markets.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, I would be getting nothing if I went in as I was now. I didn’t have the money for it.</p><p><br></p><p>There were ways of earning money though.</p><p><br></p><p>These places posted several tasks like collection of materials to the likes of killing someone. I am obviously not taking any of these jobs right now but… I will have to take them after my exams.</p><p><br></p><p>I visited the Blacksmith’s shop regularly after that. The lady was quite bored and talked to me when she was free. I got to know many things from her.</p><p><br></p><p>The hunters to the pits earned a pretty decent amount of money.</p><p><br></p><p>Unlike other territories, this territory under Grayfia Lucifuge was near the borders <em>and</em> the pits.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a dangerous place but it also meant that anything and everything that came out of the Pits was the property of Grayfia Lucifuge. However she allowed the people of her territory to hunt near the pits and sell off the things. There was obviously a tax on it to maintain the territory.</p><p><br></p><p>But apart from that, even the Mid Class Demonic Beasts from the Pits were priced to 40 million Liliums depending on the variety they were.</p><p><br></p><p>Not to mention, they collect materials from the pits.</p><p><br></p><p>There was also a specific team of Devil under her who helped clear out the Demonic Beasts near the pits so which cannot be handled by weaker Devils. This group needed members to be at the very least at High Class level.</p><p><br></p><p>The best part about this was that I didn’t have to officially become a member of anyone’s peerage to do so. I can just get contracts and in time become a High Class Devil by myself.</p><p><br></p><p>I found out about this from my teacher who is also in charge of one of these teams.</p><p><br></p><p>This is my plan to collect money for my research of magic. I wanted to join this team.</p><p><br></p><p>My final goal, make a Magic Circle for Human Magic. Kinda like the CAD’s from the Mahouka to store my spells and cast them at a moment’s notice. For this, I need to thoroughly study several Magic Circles.</p><p><br></p><p>As I was thinking of these things, there was a knock on my door and I heard a maid’s voice outside.</p><p><br></p><p>Miss Maya was back for my classes again.</p><p><br></p><p>I was already ready and thus left quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>Today however I was led to the mansion instead.</p><p><br></p><p>____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I entered the mansion to find Miss Maya sitting, being served by Berta. She was however not alone.</p><p><br></p><p>Along with her sat the same Purple haired, orange eyed girl who changed my life with just a few words.</p><p><br></p><p>Ingvild Leviathan.</p><p><br></p><p>There was another person beside them. I found myself taking a slight breath in.</p><p><br></p><p>She was stunning.</p><p><br></p><p>Grey hair, red eyes and looks that could freeze the atmosphere with just a look.</p><p><br></p><p>Her power seemed to be coiled around her tightly, not a hint being released and yet, it could be felt around her, in her presence.</p><p><br></p><p>Grayfia Lucifuge.</p><p><br></p><p>“Elias! Pay respect to them.” Aaron whispered quickly beside me, making me realise that I was just staring.</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly gave them a bow and greeted them.</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded while Ingvild looked at me with a light smile. “How have you been, Elias?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thanks to you, I have been well, My Lady. Everyone here has treated me well and takes good care of me. Thank you.” I bowed lightly.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s good to hear.” She smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Elias.” Miss Maya interrupted the conversation, looking at me. “We are going to have a spar. Consider it a surprise test. I want you to give it your all. No bars held. Don’t hold back like you always do. Is that understood?”</p><p><br></p><p>I was taken aback for a moment before I stood up straight and nodded. “Yes Teacher.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Good. Then go to the training fields.”</p><p><br></p><p>I was led out by a maid while having different thoughts in mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Is she trying to give me an opportunity to demonstrate my talents for those two?</p><p><br></p><p>I did talk to her about some ways to earn money for my Magic Research and she told me that she will see what she can do and now this…</p><p><br></p><p>Well… the least I can do is give them a good show.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Medea -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Ingvild was taken aback as soon as Elias’s spar was announced. She held it back but only till he was out of the room.</p><p><br></p><p>“Lady Medea, what is the meaning of this?”</p><p><br></p><p>“What else would it mean, Ingvild? I have been teaching a student and I want to see his progress.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But Elias!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Is a Genius beyond compare. I estimate that by the time he is of age, he would be a Satan Class being at the very least. It would be such a waste to let his talents go unexplored.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ingvild.” Grayfia spoke this time. “It’s fine. Medea doesn’t mean any harm. If anything, she cares more about the boy than anyone else in this place.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ingvild’s surprise quietened her for a while and she explained the details about Elias to her, obviously leaving some of her plans for her gem aside.</p><p><br></p><p>“The boy however is too noble for his own good. He refuses to take anything he hasn’t earned because he thinks of it as taking advantage of us who are doing so much for him. This makes it hard to give him any extra support without being suspicious. He’s also stubborn. He can bow to others in gratitude, no matter who they are but he won’t bow to anyone in servitude. I know him enough to know these things about him. I just want to provide a way for him to grow.”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy is also cautious. Despite growing closer to her, he never once spoke about his powers or showed more than a normal growth to anyone. A worthy trait.</p><p><br></p><p>Trust is not something that should be given around so easily.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, if he kept on hiding his powers, he would only end up stunting his growth.</p><p><br></p><p>Thus, she wants to provide a way for him to learn.</p><p><br></p><p>Moreover, she wanted him closer to her King.</p><p><br></p><p>Grayfia had been a little emotional since the news of the birth of the son of Sirzechs Lucifer came out, a few days ago.</p><p><br></p><p>The traitor was living a happy life while she suffered alone despite all her sacrifices. It pained her.</p><p><br></p><p>Not the fact that a child was born… rather her own situation.</p><p><br></p><p>She took this opportunity to convince her to watch her testing Elias, in the hopes of having her take an interest in him. It worked.</p><p><br></p><p>Grayfia, who was looking for something to distract herself, followed her to meet her protege.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, all that was needed was for Elias to show his power.</p><p><br></p><p>They teleported directly to the training ground.</p><p><br></p><p>The situation was quite similar to two years ago when he took that Low Class magician Examination.</p><p><br></p><p>Oh, the examination was actually valid.</p><p><br></p><p>She was a member of the Gauzaburer’s Magician Organisation. The Vice Head, to be precise.</p><p><br></p><p>Mephisto was quite accommodating after knowing her identity and it helped her recruit talents for her King. She helped him establish the Organisation at a whole new level.</p><p><br></p><p>Getting a child be named as a Magician, even a High Class one was a no effort task for her.</p><p><br></p><p>Elias was marked as a Mid Class Magician at the age of nine. Only his records were sealed by her and the only ones to know about him were her and Mephisto.</p><p><br></p><p>They had already put several barriers around the place because while he thought of himself as someone at the top of High Class, he was easily an Ultimate Class Devil with a Satan Class Soul. And this was not even considering his Magical Abilities in the Human Magic System.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you ready, Elias?” She asked him again.</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded and she smiled. Then she attacked.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Elias -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>My heart almost jumped into my mouth when I saw her attacking.</p><p><br></p><p>She wasn’t holding back.</p><p><br></p><p>The entire sky was covered with magic circles as they were ready to fire blasts from all angles at once.</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly transferred my stats to my body and mind, readjusting myself to be able to dodge everything.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Host: Elias Rimmon</strong></p><p><strong>Body: 5,000</strong></p><p><strong>Mind: 8,000</strong></p><p><strong>Spirit: 25,230</strong></p><p><strong>Magic: 3,500</strong></p><p><br></p><p>And then I momentarily closed my eyes before opening them once more, only this time the entire scenery around me had changed completely.</p><p><br></p><p>This is an ability I just awakened when my Spirit Stat crossed 25,000.</p><p><br></p><p>It was also the main reason why I was using the Mahouka System of Magic as a reference.</p><p><br></p><p>It was because this ability reminded me of something from that world.</p><p><br></p><p>Elemental Sight.</p><p><br></p><p>The ability to see the Information Realm.</p><p><br></p><p>My ability was eerily similar. I could see the entire world in terms of information. What Magic did was tamper with this information to create changes. The problem however was that they didn’t know where or what exactly the information was and could only make pointed guesses. This resulted in them using a lot of Magical Power.</p><p><br></p><p>What we underestimate is just<em> how</em> much this wastage is.</p><p><br></p><p>Even for someone like Miss Maya, according to my calculations, she wastes around two thousand four hundred times more energy than necessary.</p><p><br></p><p>With time, a Magician can estimate the information through more practice and experience leading them to control the power much better.</p><p><br></p><p>For a Magician like me, it was the best possible thing I could get.</p><p><br></p><p>I could see the invocation of a spell and attack a part of it to destabilise and break it easily.</p><p><br></p><p>I can also study the flow of Magic and the formation of the spell and copy it perfectly, although I could do the same with Magic Circles. It’s just that I need a basic Magic Circle as a cover up before I can do such a thing. The scope of what I could do with it was just boundless.</p><p><br></p><p>This skill had an insane range as well.</p><p><br></p><p>The only problem was that I needed to keep my Spirit Stat above 25,000 at all times to keep it usable.</p><p><br></p><p>Not much of a sacrifice if you ask me.</p><p><br></p><p>I stamped the ground under my feet, crushing it under me and creating a small crater as I rushed forward.</p><p><br></p><p>My eyes were already predicting the areas where the spells will hit and my Air Armour, protecting me against small attacks.</p><p><br></p><p>Her magic Circles were tracking my body heat and thus the next spell.</p><p><br></p><p>A wide area Oscillation Spell, Inferno.</p><p><br></p><p>My grimore’s page was torn and the spell came to life as I injected my Magic into it.</p><p><br></p><p>The spell caused a massive inferno around her, disorienting the Magic Circles targeting ability making it go haywire.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Grayfia -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“She’s not holding back. He’s just a child, Grayfia.” She heard Ingvild’s voice but didn't shift her attention from the fight in front of her.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the last three years, she had her ears filled with the abilities of her bishop’s so-called Gem and now she was getting to see the said abilities first hand.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s fine. Medea knows his abilities best. She will not hurt him.” She assured Ingvild although she was a bit doubtful internally. The attack she just used was used in wars against entire squadrons of enemies. It was not something one would use on a single person, let alone a child, no matter how talented.</p><p><br></p><p>Her next thoughts were all halted when the entire area around Medea turned into an inferno as the child… or whatever he was blasted over the ground at a pace that would make even Ultimate Class Devils do a back take with nothing but pure physical force.</p><p><br></p><p>The attacks rained around the entire ground for a while before Medea dispelled the Magic Circles.</p><p><br></p><p>The next second the area around them froze, putting out all the fire.</p><p><br></p><p>Mist covered the entire area before she heard a crash.</p><p><br></p><p>Huge chunks of ice were thrown towards Medea which she easily dodged but soon after, she saw the mists twisting and a sharp sound of wind from several areas of the mists.</p><p><br></p><p>Medea cast a strong wind spell, blowing away the mists, only two find white coloured balls of wind approaching her with a shrill sound.</p><p><br></p><p>The attack hit the ground as Medea dodged with a short ranged teleport to land on top of a giant piece of ice as the attack struck the ground she was at, shredding the entire area into pieces.</p><p><br></p><p>The ice and earth looked as if vapourized under that attack and the fifty metres area around the place was rendered clean.</p><p><br></p><p>Medea had spotted the boy and fired a barrage of spells once more towards the child as he erected a barrier while weaving a spell of his own.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Standing still in a battle? I thought I beat that habit out of you Elias?\"</p><p><br></p><p>The spells got concentrated on the barrier tearing it apart. The boy's eyes widened as he dodged the barrage but still got caught in the shockwave, throwing him away.</p><p><br></p><p>Ingvild shifted worriedly beside her and even Grayfia was a little moved.</p><p><br></p><p>Medea on the other hand looked unphased.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Come on. I know, an attack of such level won't hurt you directly, let alone from a shockwave. Stop pretending.\"</p><p><br></p><p>And just as she stated, the boy disappeared from his place in a haze.</p><p><br></p><p>An illusion?</p><p><br></p><p>No… a mirage.</p><p><br></p><p>He appeared directly under the place Medea was standing and froze her in a cube of ice till her neck, breathing heavily on his knees.</p><p><br></p><p>The match seemed as if it was over but Grayfia knew otherwise.</p><p><br></p><p>The Medea in the ice cube melted in shadows and another Medea appeared behind the boy.</p><p><br></p><p>“Interesting. But do you really think I would be caught so easily, Elias? I find your lack of faith in me… hurtful.”</p><p><br></p><p>“On the contrary, teacher. I am going to win this exactly because I trusted you to dodge it.”</p><p><br></p><p>Runes appeared all around the two and Medea’s magic frizzled out as she got stuck to the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy on the other hand disappeared.</p><p><br></p><p>Grayfia spread her senses around and this time felt him at the source of the seals, under the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>He came out, a distance away from Medea and looked at her.</p><p><br></p><p>Medea was actually too stunned to speak for a few moments before she laughed. She laughed. “Well done, my little gem. Well done indeed. But you put so much faith in me. How would it look if I didn’t measure up to it.”</p><p><br></p><p>Her Demonic Power rose. She stopped holding anything back and everything around her started to crumble.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy jumped back quickly as he looked in awe.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is what an Ultimate Class being feels like when they get serious, Elias.”</p><p><br></p><p>Grayfia had the urge to roll her eyes. This level of power would make most Ultimate Class beings cry and run away in fear. Medea was one of the few Satan Class Reincarnated Devils in the Underworld and now she was using her full power just to break a seal against a twelve year old. She did remember telling Medea to keep the boy humble lest he gets in over his head and get killed but still… this is too much.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ultimate Class?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I got promoted two weeks ago. And congratulations. For being able to force me into such a situation, you proved yourself as well. By my authority, I promote you to Mid Class Magician. Congratulations.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ingvild looked at her with utter disbelief at the statements while the boy himself seemed overjoyed with the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>“Grayfia… What is she talking about? How is Elias a Mid Class Magician? That level of skill… he’s clearly at an Ultimate Class. I didn’t even notice several of the spells between them or how and when they were casted. He’s clearly much above…”</p><p><br></p><p>“A Mid Class Magician who’s barely into the High Class. I know. But it’s better that he doesn’t know about it yet. Children can get overconfident easily and could get themselves into trouble. This is even more so due to his situation. You know how much danger he would be in if his powers were discovered by others. There won’t be any negotiations and he would become a target of elimination immediately. Medea is understating his powers to prevent just that from happening.”</p><p><br></p><p>\"But… . \"</p><p><br></p><p>\"We will tell him everything when he passes the Mid Class Devil exams next year. He will be strong enough to protect himself by then and also make a choice.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Ingvild looked a little unsatisfied but agreed nonetheless.</p><p><br></p><p>They watched as both the teacher and student fought with each other till the student collapsed.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>– Elias –</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I woke up on the familiar lap of my hot teacher.</p><p><br></p><p>She never takes it easy on me during the spars. That said, when it's over, she dotes on me like no one else.</p><p><br></p><p>\"That was quite an impressive performance, my Gem. Your counter attack was very great. It was on the level of a new High Class being. Congratulations.\"</p><p><br></p><p>I knew this tone of hers. It was when I could laze around and act a little spoiled.</p><p><br></p><p>So, I took full advantage of the situation and hugged her waist, snuggling into her lap a little more as she giggled lightly. \"I really thought that I was going to win this time.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I had to up my training so that I don't get left behind by you. My Student is too talented and so I am also working hard.\"</p><p><br></p><p>“You didn’t tell me that you were taking an Ultimate Class Examination.” It totally caught me off guard. I mean, sure I was happy that she became an Ultimate Class Magician and even promoted me to a Mid Class one without taking an exam but still…. It came out of nowhere.</p><p><br></p><p>“I didn’t because I wanted to surprise you. You surprised me more so I guess we are even.”</p><p><br></p><p>We talked about random things for a while.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Elias, you are now of passable strength to join the hunting teams under the Lucifuge House. I have a team of my own. Would you like to join us? I have talked to Lady Grayfia and she has agreed to this. She was quite impressed by your talents and decided to support you. You can decide what to do for your future when you pass the Mid Class Devil examination. You will not be forced to stay there if you don't want to.\"</p><p><br></p><p>… . </p><p><br></p><p>… . </p><p><br></p><p>\"Okay.\"</p><p><br></p><p>” I replied. It was the best part I can think of for now.</p><p><br></p><p>Free training and real life experience for someone like me. Not to mention a chance to earn enough money and make connections for the future.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: LuluViBritania(FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Another chapter of Story 1 after a long time.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Elias is in the upper ranks of the World and he doesn’t even know.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Medea is a ruthless teacher and an equally awesome waifu.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I had to do the time skip or it would have slowed the already slow progression a lot.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I mean, there was nothing much to be added.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Elias is a cautious guy, one of the reasons why he doesn’t question anything is because it is in line with his goal of becoming stronger.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>In fact, Elias also takes an initiative to hide some power of his own.

She hasn't said a word to me but had taken me to my room and prepared a few sets of questions for me.</p><p><br></p><p>I noticed that the level of the questions were far above what may have appeared for the examination but didn't complain. Putting almost all my stats to Mind Stat was already cheating enough. I didn't want to be a little bitch about something she was doing for my own good even if she was not required to do so. I had aced the examination in a quarter of the time. For the next paper, Berta sat in front of me and stared at me like a bird of prey while I wrote the answers. It was a bit distracting so I took longer to write this one… A full three minutes longer. </p><p><br></p><p>She had checked the paper, twice, and then merely sat there without saying anything. </p><p><br></p><p>This time however she didn't say a word and got me admitted to the examination the very next day. No questions asked. </p><p><br></p><p>That very night, Dr. Aaron came over with a cake for me. It was both to celebrate my completing the Primary Studies and… My birthday. </p><p><br></p><p>I was officially 9 years old. </p><p><br></p><p>This was also the day I found just where I was in the timeline in this world, for today was also the first birthday of the Heiress of the Gremory, the one year old, Rias Gremory. </p><p><br></p><p>Now one may wonder how I found out about it, when that house's name was a minor taboo of sorts in the mansion. Well TV is a wonderful invention. </p><p><br></p><p>In seventeen years give or take a few months was when shit hits the fan… . or doesn't in this world, I would rather err on the side of caution. </p><p><br></p><p>Aaron was very happy with my progress in his Magic Lessons and gave me a certain something I wasn't even expecting. </p><p><br></p><p>It was a book on Magic, or to be more precise, a book on Human Magic.</p><p><br></p><p>He said that he knew some people in Mephisto Pheles' Magician Organization and it was easy to have a copy made for me.</p><p><br></p><p>Devils were disdainful of the Human Magic System because one needed to work for this. I mean why would anyone do complex maths and calculations to do something that you can just imagine and use some Demonic Power to achieve. </p><p><br></p><p>This is why even if there were restrictions for Devil Magic and Magic Circles, there was no such thing for Human Magic. </p><p><br></p><p>It was actually one of the best although nigh impossible things I could get for myself. </p><p><br></p><p>I hugged the man for a full minute.</p><p><br></p><p>He explained the origin of the system of magic that the book he gave me belonged to. There were many systems of magic in this world. The spiritual magic of the Shinto priests - Onmyojutsu, the chant and ritual based magic from India that heavily relied on the faith system, the Buddhist spells used in both Japan and China, the rune based magic of The Norse, etc. The Western Magic that the magicians of Europe mainly used was based on the Devil's Magic System itself. It was actually developed by Merlin Ambrosius or rather Merlin Asmodeus, a bastard of the original Asmodeus. He was shunned and other crap that's basically forbidden from being mentioned because it was another one of the fuckups by the devils. </p><p><br></p><p>This was one of the reasons why so many Human magicians made contracts with devils for knowledge of their magic.</p><p><br></p><p>What they do is simply imitate and improve the magic spells that devils imagine and make it suitable for Human use. The stronger the devil, the stronger the spells that they can power and the better the deal for the Human magicians.</p><p><br></p><p>On the other hand, it was why this magic system was not used in or by the church. </p><p><br></p><p>This actually makes Human Magic very suitable for Devils although next to none learn it.</p><p><br></p><p>The book itself seemed handwritten, and had over twelve hundred pages. </p><p><br></p><p>Yes, a fucking twelve hundred pages. This was apparently the basics of the Magic System, a starter book for Human magicians. </p><p><br></p><p>It was still much better than the imagination power that I was doing all this time. So fucking wasteful.</p><p><br></p><p>I explained my decision of further studies to Aaron and he was all for it. He also gave me a lot of advice as he basically told me to expect failure the first time.</p><p><br></p><p>Apparently the two thousand seats per decade was also <em>heavily</em> rigged. The higher up devils use it to promote their own servants. The ones who get real promotions are two hundred at best.</p><p><br></p><p>Two hundred in among two million devils who take part in the exams every decade. </p><p><br></p><p>I felt extremely frustrated but that was apparently not the end of it all.</p><p><br></p><p>The ones who score very well are often recruited by Pillar Houses. There are a minority who reject, they more often than not don't pass or disappear before the results make it to the general public. It depends on the <em>generosity</em> of the one who made the offer. </p><p><br></p><p>I was however told by him that not all pillar houses are bad and some actually treat their members well but I was not interested in that bullshit. </p><p><br></p><p>I know that I can become stronger if I am given time. I would take my time. </p><p><br></p><p>Getting a patron was left on the side for now. </p><p><br></p><p>I poured all my frustrations into studying and training the hardest I could. </p><p><br></p><p>I put most of my stats into mind and started to work on the Magic Book. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Host: Elias Rimmon</strong></p><p><strong>Body: 20</strong></p><p><strong>Mind: 1,681</strong></p><p><strong>Spirit: 50</strong></p><p><strong>Magic: 40</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I had grown a lot when my body got used to the training I was putting it through. The food had healed my lack of nutrition and was now providing me a suitable sustenance to train. </p><p><br></p><p>The stats were piling up faster. I had asked Dr. Aaron for some books about Devil Physiology and stuff to find a way to correctly train my body and he did lend me some of them quite easily. </p><p><br></p><p>There were many things different in a Devil's Physique which explained how it was different from a human's from my limited knowledge of human physiology. </p><p><br></p><p>The core reason for all of this was - Demonic Power.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. Demonic Power was the cheat code of the Devil Race.</p><p><br></p><p>I had been training for so long while dumping my stats in Spirit and Mind but it turns out that demonic power helps to heal our body passively as well as increases the strengthening rate of the body. I had almost developed a habit of always keeping my stats in Spirit and away from Magic to facilitate its growth as well as to hide my progress but it had not been entirely correct. I changed it to Spirit and Magic when I trained my Body and experienced an enhanced growth in the Body Stat. I calculated and the increase was almost twice during the last two weeks. </p><p><br></p><p>I still have no idea about the exact powers of this system. </p><p><br></p><p>Apparently a devil child develops faster during the ages of eight to twenty two in general. Even without training their power, generally only demonic power increases to a certain level. Like for the Pillar Devils, they become anywhere between a Low High Class to a Top High Class level by their twenties. This is even more in case of the Satan Clans. I for one am lost because I have no idea how strong I am compared to others. These numbers are just a personal measure for me and I have no way to compare it to others. </p><p><br></p><p>I haven't fought anyone and hadn't dared to ask anyone about how strong I was lest they find out about my unusual powers.</p><p><br></p><p>The Human Magic System was more or less like a programming language. The basics was the introduction and rules of the Programming Language. I could see why people would be so frustrated when using this to do something when they could just imagine the same and get it done far easier. That said, the degree of efficiency and control was much better in this system. The time on the other hand, yeah, not so much. Hardly anyone would be able to program a complicated magic on the go after all. It is not as flexible as Devil Imagination Magic.</p><p><br></p><p>Oh, on that thought. Devils were not the only ones with Imagination Magic. Angels and Fallen Angels had similar types of magic too. I don’t know much about them though.</p><p><br></p><p>This book entails a lot about how to separate different forces of nature and energy types into different magical commands and use them to weave a spell to get the desired results.</p><p><br></p><p>I got up from my study table and let out a heavy breath. Remembering all the basics of the Human Magic System is difficult. Thankfully after two weeks of intense studying, pulling all nighters, which let me tell you, are far easier as a devil, I can now do basic spells.</p><p>Yes, I can use a basic Fireball spell with almost fifty times less energy now.</p><p><br></p><p>Baby steps.</p><p><br></p><p>Apparently there are ways to store Human Magic too. In Magic Circles or Grimoires. The first one is harder to get and expensive but the Grimoires can be made pretty easily. Although the Grimoires have many disadvantages that the Magic Circles don’t, like the spells from the Grimoires can be read by others, they can be stolen, they have limited number of pages, they are hard to carry to everywhere and get in the way during a battle, it still doesn’t change the fact that these things are quite easy to make. In fact the method to make one was written at the end of the book.</p><p><br></p><p>There is something else that I learned from this book, well it was a self-discovery of sorts - Human Magicians are dicks.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a line at the end of the book.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Please do not try the spells without supervision of a trained personnel.</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>P.S - Well, since you are here and safe, you should be fine either way.</em></p><p><br></p><p>I had the urge to clober the writer of the book when I read that. It was partly because it was dangerous and partly because I couldn’t tell if he was making a joke or not.</p><p><br></p><p>This studying was taking a toll on my daily grind but I couldn’t stop it either. I was planning to study this till I figure out a way to learn Gravity Spells. That will boost my training speed by a lot. Compared to that, a little delay was nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>I got to the ground and started the pushups for the day. Grinding was my way to win in this world.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Scene Change -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I walked through the markets of the city.</p><p><br></p><p>It has been a month since I took to learning Magic and while I do not like how my Stat growth slowed down. I had almost gotten to ten stats per day and that has again dropped to five to eight per day which I am starting to feel a bit iffy about. That’s why today I am out to find a solution to this problem and get something to increase my training speed.</p><p><br></p><p>The classes were just over and I was barely learning anything in the mathematics and language classes. The Social Sciences and Geography of the Underworld interested me much more than that.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean knowing the laws of the land is the basics of how to not fuck up. The culture was basically new to me.</p><p><br></p><p>On the other hand Geography had changed whatever I knew about this world on it’s head and then kicked it some more to show my foreknowledge its place.</p><p><br></p><p>The Underworld is huge. It is like earth in terms of area but with no major water bodies. The total water surface of the Underworld was less than 5%.</p><p><br></p><p>The Devils controlled an area of 11.2% of the entire Underworld, 10% went to the Fallen Angels, 14% went to Hades who managed the dead souls of many factions, around 18% was distributed among the Gods of Deaths of many other factions. That said, some factions had their own dimensions for their dead souls like Narka for the Hindu Pantheon and Yomi for the Shinto but many small Pantheons didn’t have that privilege. They all shared the Underworld more or less. That said they didn’t have entire factions to themselves and thus didn’t need much space. To be honest, if they had enough souls to need more area than they had, they could have been strong enough to get it too. The reason why they weren’t was because their Pantheons weren’t that popular and didn’t have that many followers.</p><p><br></p><p>The rest over forty percent of the area are called the Pits, for lack of a better term.</p><p><br></p><p>They were areas of extremely dense Demonic Energies which were basically the breeding grounds for Demonic Beasts in the Underworld.</p><p><br></p><p>These places have existed even before the Devil Race was supposedly created and was completely uninhabitable. The area housed some of the strongest Demonic Beasts in existence and they got stronger as the closer you got to the center.</p><p><br></p><p>There were fourteen known Pits in the Underworld of which five fell in and around the Devil’s territory. Apparently the original Satans wanted to use the Demonic Power for themselves and tame the Demonic Beasts but that clearly didn’t work.</p><p><br></p><p>While most of these Demonic Beasts were mindless creatures, some did gain Humanoid forms and were called Demons.</p><p><br></p><p>The Satans other than Lucifer were all Demons.</p><p><br></p><p>The Leviathan territory is near a water covered Pit. That’s where the title of the Original Leviathan came from… The Sea Serpent of the End, The Sea Serpent born in the End. The End here referred to the pits where all is said to end.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact even one of the current Satans had a Demon in their peerage. Serafall Leviathan’s Queen, Behemoth, the King of the Magical Beasts, or rather Demonic Beasts.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, most of the Demonic beasts were mindless animals. The Demons were quite similar but most of them preferred to live inside the pits and only the relatively weaker ones roamed around.</p><p><br></p><p>The pits were dangerous because the Demonic energy there weighed on everyone and it took a great amount of strength to even go deeper in the zones.</p><p><br></p><p>Apparently these pits are the places where the negative energies of the sinners collect. Zones full of eons of negativity before the souls regain their purity to enter the cycle of reincarnation. No wonder these places were so dangerous and… feared.</p><p><br></p><p>The Underworld is after all a place where sinners of many Pantheons are sent. While not literally Hell, it is connected to several Hells.</p><p>While wondering about the Geography of the Underworld, I reached my first destination. The Blacksmith’s shop.</p><p><br></p><p>The Blacksmith’s shop was simple and so was the man inside. A gruff man who was hammering on a sword at the corner of the smithy. There was another person on the counter, a woman with a professional smile on her face. This area is near the Fallen Angel borders so the demand for weapons was never low. This and the fact that people hunted Demonic Beasts to sell their flesh.</p><p><br></p><p>“What do you need, laddie? Here to buy a toy sword or something?” the woman smiled at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“I need weights, rectangular blocks of metals, the heavier the better. Please make them two fingers width and a third of a foot long. I need enough to make eighty kilograms of them.”</p><p><br></p><p>She for her professionalism noted everything properly and even asked questions where needed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay, that’s good. I have a general idea about the shape and size of the things you need. Now I just need to know what kind of material and build you want. We have materials that can conduct Demonic Power but those are a bit pricey.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I need simple metals. As long as they don’t rust, don’t corrode and are non poisonous. Although heavier metals will be preferred I would like the price to be of main concern.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, may I suggest something?” she said after thinking for a few moments.</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“You said you need weights. I have metals for this. Normal metals from the human world can do your work but what do you need these weights for? I think I might have an idea but will still be sure if you tell me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“For training.” I answered. It’s not like she would assume that they are for me by default.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah. Training the body. The devils nowadays don’t even understand the meaning of training their bodies. Magic for every Satan damned thing. I married my husband, Lythor, partly because of that muscular body.” The man in question almost missed a hammer strike after hearing that. “Listen here my adorable hellspawn, ladies always like a fit guy. You gotta train your body perfectly. Anyways, one hundred kilograms wouldn’t be for you but you should also pay attention to it. Now, coming back to the topic. If you want body weights as I feel you do, you would be better off with the Sharp-horned Rhinoceros' bone used instead. These bones have the property to increase in weight as long as Demonic Power is poured into them and stay heavy for an hour long afterwards. You can adjust the weight as much as you want up to four tonnes. Although the price will be a bit more than normal. These bones are used as the core of Sledgehammers for Demonic Beast Hunters and tools for the miners.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Can a Middle Class Devil charge it enough?” I asked. I am pretty sure my Magic is around 20 right now and is nowhere near the level of a Mid Class Devil that said, being able to sense Demonic Power is also a difficult thing and not many can do it.</p><p><br></p><p>“Even a Low Class Devil can make the weights go up to 150 kilograms, a Mid Class could make it over a ton easily. The Sharp Horned Rhinoceros is stronger than most Middle Class Devils but weaker than any High Class ones so the bones might not be able to bear the magic of a High Class Devil and might break. We don’t guarantee any take backs for such a case.” she replied sharply.</p><p><br></p><p>“Can you tell me the price for five such pieces? One each for the limbs and waist. It would be helpful if the size can be adjusted for future use by other people.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, that will be Ⱡ25,000 each for the bracelets and Ⱡ35,000 for the waist bands, a total of one hundred and thirty five thousand Liliums.”</p><p><br></p><p>One hundred and thirty five… fucking hell.</p><p><br></p><p>I got a pocket change of twenty thousand Liliums per month. It has been almost six months and I have one hundred and ten thousand Liliums lift since all I needed was to buy clothes and some normal things for myself. Most of the stuff was provided by Berta for me, especially the most expensive one of all - food.</p><p><br></p><p>I was getting a very generous spending allowance every month according to what I know.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t look so surprised, Laddie. The Demonic Beast that we get this from is a borderline High Class. It takes over two dozen Mid Class Hunters to get it so it is obvious that these things cost a pretty Lilium.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A few dozen? Are High Class beings really that strong?” I asked completely innocently this time. I really had no idea about it. To be honest my knowledge about the anime was a waste from what I have seen so far. The world is quite different and I have no idea what is what anymore.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well obviously. A dozen Low Class Devils couldn’t fight a Mid Class Devil and over twice the number of Mid Class Devils wouldn’t stand a chance against a High Class one, especially those from the Clans. Although Demonic beasts are mindless, they still have stronger bodies and are resistant to magic which makes it hard to hunt them. However their meat and bones are high in demand. They naturally conduct Demonic Power and some even give the weapons made from them certain special properties. A single Sharp-Horned Rhinoceros can cost anything between 4 million Liliums to a whooping 14 million Liliums.” She was very enthusiastic when explaining about all these and I could tell that she actually liked talking. I for one was getting free information from her so it didn’t harm me either.</p><p><br></p><p> “I… I would like to think about it a bit. Can I come again tomorrow?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure Laddie, take your time. Tell your elders about the price. I understand that you might be a bit intimidated by that. A Low Class devil would earn it in six months. One cannot just spend such money willy nilly without a thought, well… not people like us at least.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded and walked out of the shop but not before checking out the products first. It was time to do some through research.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next two days I wandered around the entire city. Traveling is easy when you have wings. I visited almost all the Blacksmith Shops in the entire city that I could find out about. The price of such equipment was around the same range. Some were made up of different Demonic Beast parts but the overall price was quite similar. The first set of equipment was the most comfortable and well made one.</p><p><br></p><p>In the end, I bought only four weights, one for my arms and legs each. The waist belt had to wait a few more months. Thankfully the woman gave me a slight discount after a bit of haggling… or rather how dumb haggling with a nine year old might have looked like. She was busy giggling half the time and I was cursing my childish body.</p><p><br></p><p>The purchases however were the best investment I had made since coming to this world.</p><p><br></p><p>That day itself, my body's Stat growth increased by four times… I got an increase of twenty in my stats that day. Although the next day my body refused to move and I felt pain all over, it was proof that the training was working. I had trained my body for five hours that day and my growth was beyond anything I had seen so far.</p><p><br></p><p>This only steeled my decision to buy that waist belt when I acquired enough money. Right now, having only twenty thousand Liliums with me was a bit of a problem.</p><p><br></p><p>It also ensured that my progress is not slowed while I learn Magic.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- ??? Pov  -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She walked to the castle of her King. The servants cleared the way. This last task of her King was interesting after all….oh so much more interesting than she had thought was possible.</p><p><br></p><p>She entered her King’s office after a knock to see her sitting behind the desk, working on her daily chores. She looked up at her arrival and looked at the servant who was standing beside her. “Leave us alone.”</p><p><br></p><p>The door closed behind the servant and she threw some privacy spells just to be secure while her King merely raised an eyebrow at her actions.</p><p><br></p><p>“So I assume that there were complications? Since what needed to be just a few days of work took you five months.”</p><p><br></p><p>She walked around the desk and sat on the armrest of her King’s chair. For normal people, such actions would have been unthinkable but she had been with her King for the longest and was closer to her than anyone else, their pasts connecting them both. “Oh, the work was done in a few days alright. The boy was safe. He wasn’t sent by anyone. He indeed had locked away his memories due to trauma. There were no traces of foreign magic. I checked his body thoroughly for any drug use to put him into temporary amnesia and there was none. I checked it myself after putting him to sleep and then hypnotizing him to know about his intentions. He was really grateful to Ingvild and wanted to repay her favours someday. He held no grudge against any of us and was actually quite grateful to us. I had to skip anything that would stir his memories and cause his magic to act out so it was a bit hard questioning him. Apart from that I dug out each and every bit of information I could on him, matched his DNA with the deceased too and verified that he was not a plant by any faction, which was already unlikely if I may add. There was no way anyone could have anticipated that Ingvild would pick the boy up. In fact the people made his connection to her in some way, what with their similar hair colour and all. It was hilarious to see people making assumptions.” She giggled at the memories of the rumours around the entire city when they found out about the boy.</p><p><br></p><p>Her King put down her pen and slumped back into her chair and she took the opportunity to comb her hair with her fingers, slightly caressing her cheeks. “You are very tired. Did you push yourself again?”</p><p><br></p><p>Her answer was her King’s silent stare towards the wall.</p><p><br></p><p>She knew this even when she asked the question. After all, she had been through this too. To change the mood in the room she decided to get back to their previous topic.</p><p><br></p><p>“So… not going to ask me why I took five months for something that would only have taken a few days?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Knowing you, you would speak about the topic when you wanted. My questions wouldn’t have mattered when you are in <em>this</em> mood.” Her king rolled her eyes earning a giggle from her.</p><p><br></p><p>“And you would be right about that. I am happy, Grayfia. I haven’t felt this sort of excitement in a while.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh. And what would make you that excited? The boy?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes yes, my darling Grayfia. The boy. He is… an utter madman. An absolute maniac the likes of which are rarely seen and I was fascinated by him and everything he did.” she giggled remembering some of the boy’s antics, the more unique ones.</p><p><br></p><p>Grayfia raised an eyebrow.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well let me explain. Have you ever heard a young Low Class Devil, using the name of the Father of Angels to… train?”</p><p><br></p><p>Grayfia’s mouth opened slightly as her eyes widened in disbelief. “That would be… was it an injury to the brain, or maybe if you hadn’t confirmed it already, an implant of the Heaven faction?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Not really. The colourful language he used and swearing to surpass him after recovering every time was a pretty big giveaway. He was trying to… build up his resistance to it. His daily routine was studying and learning everything he could. From normal alphabets to history, political situations between different factions, the geography, common sense to anything and everything he could find. The amnesia might have awakened a thirst of knowledge in him. The other prominent thing that defines him is… training. The near-death experience might have left a mental trauma on the child but he is certainly benefiting from it so I didn’t interfere. He trains just like you do, putting in everything to become stronger. That was the first thing that attracted me to him… the second was his mysterious power.” She paused. “The boy has awakened a new bloodline trait, Grayfia. A <em>very</em> powerful one if my guesses about it are correct. This child… he can surpass every other devil if his power is what I think it is and if he could pass it on to his children, we are looking at a clan of supposedly Satan Class Devils at the very least… maybe even more.”</p><p><br></p><p>Grayfia stiffened. The topic was as such that it required such a reaction from even her.</p><p><br></p><p>Newly Awakened devils were not unheard of but were extremely rare.</p><p><br></p><p>When Lilith and Lucifer created the devil race, a few of them were born with power beyond their peers and special powers to go along with it, the Clan Traits. A total of seventy two special devils were born among the millions created and they were given the ranks of nobility by Lucifer and the other Satans and became the seventy two ‘Pillars’ that supported the devil race.</p><p><br></p><p>But that was not the end of it all. Later on, among the second generation of Devils, a few more awakened special abilities. These were however not given nobilities because ranks had already been established and being unsure of how much the awakening rate would be, they couldn’t hand over nobility to everyone. Thus they were given land and taken under the service of the Satans, becoming the Extra Demons. The first one among these were… the Lucifuges.</p><p><br></p><p>The latter generations however had one awakened and the ones after that rarely had any. In the period of over ten thousand years, only nineteen known awakeners were found and were made the Extra Demon houses. This was also something that had caused the Pillar Houses to look down on them and claim them to be second rate.</p><p><br></p><p>It was only their positions as the direct servants of the Satans that kept anyone from directly saying anything. The attitudes of the two sides caused some friction to develop between them.</p><p><br></p><p>The Great War saw to the end of the Satans and the Extra Demons mostly stuck to the old Satan descendants because their positions were bound to them. If the original Satan Houses fell, so would the positions of the Extra Demons which was exactly what happened. Some houses did remain neutral but only about half a dozen of the remaining eighteen houses survived (One had already been extinguished during the Great War) and none of them except the Lucifuge which was down to her King held any power. They had all been pushed to the borders of the Underworld with rarely any connection to the rest of the Underworld. </p><p><br></p><p>In the last five hundred years or so, there had been no reports of even a single awakener.</p><p><br></p><p>There were rumours of some but they were ruthlessly suppressed and from what they could gather, such people were never found, completely erased.</p><p><br></p><p>The remaining Pillars didn’t want any new ‘low class upstart’ to share their powers and privileges and thus were ruthless.</p><p><br></p><p>This was why this topic was so sensitive.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tell me everything you know about this.” Grayfia got serious after realising the stakes.</p><p><br></p><p>\"The boy seemed to have realised his Trait's abilities and drowned himself in training. He was still experimenting with the powers of his trait and doesn't seem to know everything about it. \"</p><p><br></p><p>\"What is this Trait? What powers does it have? \"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Umm from what I could guess, it seemed to be an Auxiliary type of Clan Trait. I believe it lets him shift his attributes among each other?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Shift Attributes?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"See it this way. He trains his body and then shifts his increase in strength to magic, bringing his body's power back to its previous level. He could drastically increase his power by shifting all his attributes into one.\"</p><p><br></p><p>She could see the gears in her king's head turning. \"So if he redistributes his attributes, he can maintain his body at a stage where the growth is at the fastest or do the same for his magic, thus always maintaining the fastest growth. Which aspects of himself can he manipulate? Only the body and magic?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"That's what took me five months to find out, without violating his mind. I believed little Ingvild wouldn't appreciate that and neither would the boy. I have reasons to believe that he can even alter the strength of his mind and soul at will.\"</p><p><br></p><p>This time the reaction was exactly as she had expected.</p><p><br></p><p>\"That's impossible. Increasing those two things is near impossible or I would…\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I didn't believe it at first myself. It was just that ridiculous. But I observed that his gains were disappearing and yet he seemed happy. Then on further inspection I found out about his growth of demonic power. I used several spells and found out that he could indeed manipulate the strength of his soul. From the time I started observing him till the time I left, his soul's strength increased from a low Mid Class to a strong High Class Devil.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"The increased strength of his soul will increase his growth of demonic power which can be shifted to his soul further increasing his demonic power's growth in an ever increasing cycle.\" Grayfia whispered, finally understanding the immensity of the power and the sheer potential the boy represented. \"If he doesn't have a limit…\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Exactly. But you forgot the last part. He can increase his mind's strength too.\" She saw that she had successfully gained the attention of her King and continued, \"it took him three and a half months to complete all his primary education after which I had Berta test him personally. The boy scored perfectly in a test far above his standard as long as it was something he was taught. He didn't have any extra knowledge but derivable things were still done to the best. I further tested him by having a personally written book on the Human System passed on to him both as compensation for participating in my experiment and the experiment itself. How much time do you think it took him to figure it out by himself?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"The Human Magic system is quite complicated and a normal magician of his age with proper help would take a year to figure out how to cast spells. A month probably?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"A week. It took him just a simple week to completely understand the basics and even do a simple spell… <em>without</em> any sort of assistance. Although his mind was not at the same level during some other veiled tests I put him through. This leads me to believe that he can shift his mental attributes too.\"</p><p><br></p><p>A devil who can completely manipulate its entire being, completely change its fighting style, hide its power from others and drastically increase its powers at a moment's notice. That was indeed worth investing in. Now only if her King can get beyond her distrust of men.</p><p><br></p><p>A few minutes went by as Grayfia thought in silence before opening her mouth. \"Observe him. It will attract too much attention if we take someone in. I don't believe that there aren't spies in the city from other devil houses. Ingvild taking the boy alone wouldn't attract attention if he is left alone but if he, a low class devil starts to be groomed by us personally, people will question, especially after the rumours of them being related surface. From what you have reported, he is preparing for the Mid Class Devil tests. Just make it so that he is fairly graded and kept away from other influences and hide his powers from others. A few years will calm this matter down. I will offer him a chance to decide if he wants to enter our services,  maybe in Ingvild's peerage. She still hasn't started collecting members yet. Till then ask Berta to keep him… humble.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I want to take him in. It would be wasting his best growth period if we let him waste these four and a half years. If I put him through a proper training program, he can become a solid Ultimate Class or even touch the cusps of the Satan Class.\" She argued. </p><p><br></p><p>\"I understand that but too much power in a short amount of time would go to his head and talent doesn't matter if it can't be transformed into strength. Let him learn the meaning of hard work. If you want, give him an idea to hire a teacher for magic through Berta and teach him under disguise but do not reveal yourself. These few years can be used to test his character.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Why test, Grayfia? This is a nine year old gem whose brightness grows more with each passing day. We have faced betrayals from men in the past. Why not raise a man perfect for ourselves. I know you don't want to let the Lucifuge line die with you. This boy can surpass Ajuka or even <em>him</em>.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"ENOUGH… We are not talking about this anymore.\" Grayfia snapped hard. </p><p><br></p><p>She took a deep breath. Maybe she should have approached the subject slower. </p><p><br></p><p>Silence prevailed for a while between them for a while and no one spoke any words. </p><p><br></p><p>\"I am not ready for such a thing. I don't know if I will ever be. Not until I am strong enough to protect my children from others. I don't think I can bear seeing another one of my family members die in front of me. Euclid's… dying face still haunts my memories and I see my hands covered in his blood. I can't do this. I can't, Medea.\"</p><p><br></p><p>She embraced her King and brought her to her bosom, simply caressing her hair.</p><p><br></p><p>She might not be strong enough to protect her future child… but… A child has two parents. That boy had shown her something that has the potential to surpass both Sirzechs and Ajuka in their own fields… At the same time. She would never let such a chance go by. She will make him a man that would make the whole world tremble just by his presence… and she will stand beside him, looking down on all who had scorned her. But… For now, she had a King to relieve and soothe. </p><p><br></p><p>She lifted her face to hers and looked into her eyes and… their lips met. A snap of her fingers made their clothes slide off their bodies and whispers and moans filled the room.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>-  Elias Rimmon -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>An arrow of water shot forward, shattering the earth target twenty metres in front of me. Four months in and my magic has progressed at a reasonable rate. I haven’t been able to figure out Gravity Magic yet but when I asked Aaron about it, he had laughed it off. According to him, Gravity is a higher level Magic and would need a High Class Magician to even try something like Gravity Magic.</p><p><br></p><p>The stages of the Human Magic system is similar to that of the devil ranking system. Low, Middle, High, Ultimate Class. Except the likes of Merlin who was rumoured to have strength rivalling that of a Satan, no other normal Human Magic System user has reached that level. It was also a reason why Magicians like Samuel Liddel Mcgregor Mathews, the founder of Golden Dawn and Rudiger Rosenkreutz became reincarnated Devils, to pursue higher levels of Magic.</p><p><br></p><p>They still haven’t reached the fabled Satan Class yet.</p><p><br></p><p>Currently there are less than a dozen Satan Class Devils in the entire underworld including the two who are termed as Super Devils who far surpass the level of a Satan Class and thus people only use rankings upto the Ultimate Class when referring to power levels.</p><p><br></p><p>The Satan Class means rivalling the power of the Original Satans and currently even among the Top Ten Rating Games players, only Diehauser Belial was classed as a Satan Class devil and that too… barely.</p><p><br></p><p>These past few months have been very different for me.</p><p><br></p><p>It all started when I accidentally broke my bed after I had forgotten to adjust the training weights. This obviously had attracted the attention of Berta. I had to explain to her about the weights because hiding anything was not going to cut it there. I was not under the disillusion that they didn’t know about my workouts all day. That would be stupid to even assume in a place which was supposedly a house for nobility. The staff would be very well trained to pick out such discrepancies</p><p><br></p><p>Her reaction was what had surprised me the most. She had just rolled her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>She had then gone off and explained how training with weights without proper supervision could be dangerous and then called Aaron and had him explain to me the proper ways of using the weights.</p><p><br></p><p>She might have reasoned that she was doing so only because she didn’t want to answer Miss Ingvild if something happened to me under her care but I could see that she actually cared. It was hard not to develop some sort of bond between people when you see mostly each other for eleven months now and we were starting to warm up to each other.</p><p><br></p><p>I still hid my stats though and my power but now I needed to reveal more to show that my training was actually working, the reason being Aaron regularly checking me for any health problems.</p><p><br></p><p>And let me tell you guys… my training speed soared with just a bit of proper guidance. It was the difference between someone who ran by themselves and a professional athlete who was being trained for the Olympics. The difference would be massive.</p><p><br></p><p>The second part was, the Magic.</p><p><br></p><p>I very well couldn’t practice Magic inside my room or the house.</p><p><br></p><p>I needed to try out the spells outside. I had considered trying it when outside the house but gave up on that idea remembering the place we were in.</p><p><br></p><p>I had to practice Magic outside in the garden near my room and that was easily visible to others. The maids of the house often took a look at my practice, especially Berta. I did get introduced to a few of them and they were all Mid Class or above, trained professionals.</p><p><br></p><p>While I did gain some favours due to my now adorable looks, it was all normal things like candies and snacks.</p><p><br></p><p>My practice in Magic however was noticed by Aaron who offered me a chance to get admitted to Gauzaberer Magicians Organisation if I wanted to.</p><p><br></p><p>I was ecstatic at the news. There was a catch like everything else. I was a Low Class Devil and the Gauzaberer Magician Organisation was in the human world which meant I couldn’t go there till I was a Mid Class Devil. Although there was a side route. If I impressed Mephisto Pheles, I could probably gain a favour from him and be sponsored to attend.</p><p><br></p><p>Mephisto Pheles was an Ultimate Class Devil and taking me to the Human World to be a part of the organisation wouldn’t be much of a problem for him.</p><p><br></p><p>This however required me to do extremely well in my Magical Studies and become a Mid Class Magician by the age of twelve because that seemed to have been the record.</p><p><br></p><p>If that was the case, someone could take me in as an apprentice.</p><p><br></p><p>As such I could prepare. He had offered to call his friend for a favour if I showed promise in Magic to arrange for more books for me. I agreed and even paid for the price for the extra books despite Aaron’s reluctance. I already owed the man a lot. Taking even more seemed unfair and thus my insistence to pay the cost myself.</p><p><br></p><p>I got a couple of books on magic the next day itself and this time they were paid for by me.</p><p><br></p><p>To become a Mid Class Magician, I have to take their examination or be referred to the organisation by a qualified Ultimate Class Magician or four High Class Magicians. They don't usually go easy in these tests because the referrals count as their contribution to the organisation allowing them to earn points for themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>As for the Ultimate Class Magicians, no one would care if they got a simple Mid Class Magician in.</p><p><br></p><p>According to him, when I pass the Low Class Magician examination, I will have to hire a tutor for myself.</p><p><br></p><p>My Stats have grown smoothly since I got the training weights. My natural growth of Magic Stat had also increased and further enhanced due to the daily training in Magic. I had substituted my extra Meditation time to Magic Training as the gain speed was much faster. My stats grew to a respectable range now. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Host: Elias Rimmon</strong></p><p><strong>Body: 40</strong></p><p><strong>Mind: 2,000</strong></p><p><strong>Spirit: 2,250</strong></p><p><strong>Magic: 400</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The only problem I was encountering was not knowing my exact strength.</p><p><br></p><p>The Preparatory Classes didn't teach any magic or fighting skills. So I could hardly see anyone fighting. </p><p><br></p><p>There was also the fact that I knew nothing about fighting. I could just cast spells and I had recently learned how to make Grimoires and use them to spam my spells but I had no knowledge of any martial arts or how magical fights usually happened.</p><p><br></p><p>I also had no solid idea what range of stats represented what power levels. </p><p><br></p><p>My only knowledge came from Berta's comments according to whom, 400 was barely a Mid Class Level.</p><p><br></p><p>I once had a thought of pushing my magic power to overpower my training weights and measuring if my Stats were upto the level of a High Class Devil but I gave up on that thought because I had grown attached to the weights and… I didn’t know how strong the explosion would be.</p><p><br></p><p>Curiosity killed the Cat is a very famous saying after all. Unfortunately satisfaction would not restore my blown up weights, refund my money or hide the fact I managed to somehow gain enough demonic power to blow them up in the first place.</p><p><br></p><p>So I had to keep my curiosity in check for now and believe 400 to be the Mid Class Devil’s starting range. According to that, I was slightly a Mid Class Level in all of my stats even if they were distributed equally. Above that is still a mystery.</p><p><br></p><p>Today was the day I wanted to attempt my first exam for the Rank of a Low Class Magician.</p><p><br></p><p>It consisted of four parts. There were some slight changes in the rules for me because I was a Devil and had an innate advantage in Magic so an extra part was added.</p><p><br></p><p>Spell Creation.</p><p><br></p><p>I had to show two spells of my own creation. As long as it is a Low Level Spell, I will get a pass.</p><p><br></p><p>The tests were, a written test, demonstration of two spells of my own creation, subduing or killing a Low Level Demonic Beast and finally spar with the examiner.</p><p><br></p><p>A Low Level Demonic beast was a mindless wild animal with Demonic Power and a normal Low Level Magician is expected to easily subdue or kill such a thing. The spar was for extra credits.</p><p><br></p><p>Soon enough I was called by another one of the maids to the examination venue which was the other side of the mansion.</p><p><br></p><p>In the venue, I could see Berta and Aaron along with another person. This woman had a cloak with black and gold, completely hiding the upper part of her face. I could only see her lips with a purple lipstick on them.</p><p><br></p><p>I guess this is my examiner.</p><p><br></p><p>“Elias, come and say hello to your examiner. This is Miss Maya, a High Class Magician from the Gauzaberer Organisation. She will be your examiner for this exam and your mentor if you pass this exam.” Aaron told me.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Interlude -</strong></p><p><strong>- Berta -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Berta watched as the boy sat for the exams.</p><p><br></p><p>She had very complex thoughts about the boy from the first day when she was told that someone will be living in the mansion by Lady Ingvild. Berta had avoided all contact with everyone outside the mansion because of her fear of losing them. She knew this much without anyone else pointing it out to her, although she didn’t lack of being pointed out by her stupid brother, Aaron. Thus, this was a shock for her when she was told to temporarily take care of a child, a boy nonetheless.</p><p><br></p><p>Aaron had taken a shine to the little boy with amnesia, probably projecting his own child on him. After all they were in a very similar situation, one lost his parents and the other his child, but she had maintained her distance.</p><p><br></p><p>She wasn’t mentally as strong as Aaron.</p><p><br></p><p>The child however made it hard to hate him or even dislike him no matter how much she wanted to keep away. He had been perfectly obedient, always studying or training while hiding. She scoffed at the attempts of the child.</p><p><br></p><p>Each maid of the house was recruited after a very harsh test and were all Mid Class Devils… at the time of their recruitment. They were however put under hard training so that each of them were pushed to a High Class level within five years of recruitment. Any Pillar Devil would have lost their minds at the sheer force present in just <em>one</em> of her mansions. Lady Grayfia wasn’t afraid of anyone rebelling from their side because unlike other Pillar Devils, she never gave anyone a reason to do so, and… she was too strong to worry about mere High Class Devils.</p><p><br></p><p>She monitored the child for the signs of anything amiss, lest he be a spy and while she found many inconsistencies from normal children, she could be sure of one thing and that was that the boy was not a spy. This fact was only confirmed when Lady Medea had questioned him under her spells, and verified his identity herself… And that’s where things became strange.</p><p><br></p><p>Lady Medea, someone who was known to hate men in general, had taken a shine to the child without even meeting him directly or having a ‘proper’ conversation.</p><p><br></p><p>She for her life didn’t understand why that was so at the beginning. Well that was until he was passed the Book on the Human Magic System by Aaron.</p><p><br></p><p>She had watched with mouth agape as the boy did something that would take even geniuses a few months <em>with</em> the assistance of a good teacher.</p><p><br></p><p>And that was when she started realising different things about the boy.</p><p><br></p><p>The training weights that broke the furniture had to be at least several hundred kilograms if they could break the material of the furniture. He was far stronger than she realised.</p><p><br></p><p>She had never felt his strength at Mid Class Devil but that…</p><p><br></p><p>From then on she started to observe his training more and more and found to her sheer incredulity that the boy was completely out of common sense.</p><p><br></p><p>Lady Medea had relayed a direct order to keep the boy humble and thus she had to severely understate his strength to him. It wasn’t hard for her. She was the Head Maid of two hundred High Class Devils. Something like that took strength. Berta herself was an Ultimate Class Devil in terms of strength although she never took her High Class examinations.</p><p><br></p><p>This observation however had another effect. She began getting close to the child, unwittingly.</p><p><br></p><p>“My Lady, would he really be alright… that’s a Mid Class Demonic Beast. I know he himself is Middle Class, almost at the top of that range in terms of strength but… he has never fought anyone. He just doesn’t have the experience to go with it. The Demonic Beast is also resistant to magic attacks. He might…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my, is that worry I see there Berta?” Lady Medea giggled and she stiffened at the realisation. She was however unperturbed, “Don’t worry about it, Berta. The Demonic Beast would probably be the easiest for him if he really wanted it to. Also… he is not a Mid Class Devil level in strength. He is easily a High Class Devil, upper ranges. I told you to not judge the boy by conventional means. Always estimate his strength a level above you can observe, two for caution.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A High Class Devil? But that… he’s just nine. Not even the Pillar Devils have that…” Aaron stuttered at the realisation.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t compare my gem to those entitled little brats. He is destined to surpass them all.”</p><p><br></p><p>Aaron went still at the bite in her voice and Berta realised that the things were probably far more complicated than she understood initially.</p><p><br></p><p>With several thoughts in mind, she watched Elias take on a test that would have other Mid Class Magicians running for their lives while still thinking of it as a Low Class exam.</p><p><br></p><p>_____________________________________x___________________________________________________________________________x______________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: LuluViBritania(FF.N, SB and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>So, I decided to write another chapter of this one.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The next one may be different or the same.
