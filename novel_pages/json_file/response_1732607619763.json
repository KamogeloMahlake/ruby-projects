    "content": "<p>Trying to escape from a horde of undead while trying to protect the famous head librarian of the Silver Spires wasn’t what I had been expecting when I woke up, but I took it in stride. I was getting used to the curveballs the life was throwing to my way.</p><p>I raised my hand after we took a turn, mana gathering at my palm. The librarian rose her hand in an instant, her fingers glowing brightly, her expression threatening despite her exhaustion. I felt the hairs on the back of my neck rose in fear as I realized my mistake. Casting a spell on a situational ally afraid of her situation wasn’t the safest thing to do. </p><p>Luckily, the situation was dangerous enough that rather than blasting me directly, she chose to threaten me. “Calm down, I’m trying to mask your presence,” I said even as I pointed my own body, and let the biomancy-based spell to cover my body and mask my life presence. The spell took hold much easier thanks to my skill increase, while the librarian’s eyes grew in surprise. </p><p>[-15 Mana]</p><p>“You can cast it on me as well,” she said after a moment’s hesitation. I appreciated her quick response, as I could hear the undead moving once again. I flexed my mana once again, ignoring the sense of exhaustion that filled my being. Still, I forced myself to cast another spell, this time creating two fake life signatures dashing out of the canyon, directly toward the school. </p><p>[-36 Mana]</p><p>“Let’s move,” I said, but rather than dashing outside the canyon, I turned back.  </p><p>She followed me for a while, but I could see the doubt on her face as we moved deeper into the canyon. “We shouldn’t move too deep,” she said, though her tone was already reminiscent of order despite her exhaustion. </p><p>“Why?” I asked, more to highlight the fact that I wasn’t her subordinate at the moment rather than actually learning her reasoning, which was obvious. She wanted to use the opportunity to slip away from the canyon before the necromancers could establish a cordon, not wanting it to turn it an endurance battle when her mana was so low. Of course, she didn’t know that, for the next several hours, I had the absolute advantage thanks to my mana regeneration. </p><p>And if that gave her the impression that I was stronger than I actually was, all the better. </p><p>Upon being questioned, her displeasure was clear. After all, back in the school, she was famous for her unbending ways, not just against the staff and the students, but also against the other faculty members. It was evidence of just how exhausted she was that she actually chose to explain. “We have already ditched them thanks to your spell. That’s the best opportunity for us to get away from the canyon before they realize our trick and envelop the canyon.”</p><p>“I don’t think that’ll work,” I countered. “When we step off of the canyon, we’ll be out in the open. They have too many disposable soldiers for us to be confident about ditching them safely.” </p><p>“At least we would have a chance,” she countered, her anger intensified. “Once they return and envelop the canyon, we’ll be sitting ducks, and they’ll find us long before we could recover enough mana.” </p><p>Even with her exhaustion and her thankfulness about being saved, I could see that her patience was running thin. “Long before you could gather enough mana,” I countered with a smirk on my face, mostly thanks to my subterfuge, because I was trembling inside. </p><p>“You can recover mana faster,” she stated, not bothering to hide her shock, while I nodded, doing my best to look nonchalant. Her shock was not misplaced, as according to everything I read, mana regeneration had always been an insurmountable challenge for the mages, restricting their leveling efficiency greatly by forcing them to rely on warrior specializations. “When will your mana refill?” </p><p>Under her careful gaze, I felt like an animal to be dissected. Even if the mana regeneration wasn’t my biggest secret, revealing it to someone whom I didn’t have the slightest leverage against was dangerous, especially that someone was significantly stronger. Still, since I had already taken the step, there was no reason to hold back. “About half an hour,” I said, glad that I had the perk active from both Aviada and Helga. Sometimes, being prepared helped. </p><p>She smiled, and for a moment, her harsh expression melted, revealing the beauty hidden under her prickly demeanor. “That’s good,” she said. “Our survival is almost guaranteed now.” </p><p>I responded to her with my best smile, using the full extent of my charisma and my charm, even though the rational part of my mind cursed me for daring to something as stupid as trying to seduce the head librarian. The horny part of my brain, on the other hand, showed its full support, especially with my memory bringing forth the amazing sight I had observed when she was in the shower.</p><p>Some things were worth the risk, I decided. </p><p>We moved in silence for a few minutes, then I gestured her to stop when I noticed a perfect hideout. “Why do we stop here?” she asked. </p><p>“It’s the perfect defensible spot,” I explained even as I moved to the nearest wall and started to draw a rune. “The entrance is small enough to prevent the bone dragons from entering, and while some of the walls are a bit thin, we can reinforce them with runes, which will also function as an escape route. Moreover, we could easily trap the path leading to the entrance, and the cave itself is large enough that they can’t force us out with area-effect spells.” </p><p>“That’s an awful lot of enchantments,” she said doubtfully. “Even with your regeneration, can you really do all that before they find us?” </p><p>Her suspicion was reasonable. After all, the enchantments I had mentioned wasn’t the simplest in terms of mana consumption, not to mention the great variety we required to implement them successfully. However, thanks to my excessive stats, I had a mana pool quite a bit larger than my level justified. </p><p>Rather than answering, I started drawing the first runes on the walls of the cave to hide our life signature as well as partially suppressing mana fluctuations. It would not allow us to freely throw fireballs and lightning bolts, but we would be able to charge the defensive runes faster than a tortuous’ crawl. </p><p>After some complicated mental calculations, I started working on the defensive enchantments. “That’s an interesting rune,” she murmured as I draw the first reinforcement rune on the wall to prevent the walls from being collapsed with a swipe of a bone-dragon. “It lacks an internal balancing component, but you’re balancing it with your own magic,” she added, with just the slightest doubt. After all, stabilizing a rune was beginner stuff, which made my choice a bit weird at the first glance.” </p><p>I didn’t say anything, but focused on drawing the second rune, once again balancing it with my own magic, but pulling just a dash from the first one. “Interesting,” she murmured. </p><p>“Impressive perception,” I said, even as I couldn’t help but feel slightly bummed. I was hoping to impress her after the full scheme had been completed, though I guessed that was a bit arrogant. She wasn’t one of the most famous mages of the Empire for no reason. </p><p>“Not as impressive as trying to build such a large defensive scheme without self-balancing nodes, relying their magical weight on each other to achieve balance,” she said, for once, sounding impressed. “It requires more finesse to establish, but it would be more stable. Genius,” she continued, easily summarizing the benefits of my approach. </p><p>“I can’t take the full credit,” I said with a dismissive wave. “The idea belongs to a friend, I just came with the practical application for it.” </p><p>“I would like to meet that friend someday,” she said in a casual tone. </p><p>Too casual, even, but I didn’t comment on it. For all of her direct reputation, she apparently could play it slowly as well. It was an invitation for me to talk about who I was, but in a way that I could easily ignore without being rude. I chose to ignore, as I had already revealed more than I was comfortable with. “Maybe someday,” I answered in a similar easygoing manner as I finished another rune, feeling a sweat sliding down on my forehead. The array cost significantly less in terms of mana compared to the traditional approach, but required intense concentration when finalizing it. </p><p>My esteemed guest chose to sit a nearby rock, carefully examining me as I engraved the array, her gray eyes shining with deep concentration despite her clear exhaustion. Under her careful gaze, I carefully finished the last node before placing the last of the connection, then let out a sigh, letting myself breathe freely once more. </p><p>[-476 Mana]</p><p>[Mana: 531 / 1683]</p><p> The array cost me a good chunk of mana, but funny enough, my mana was around four hundred when I started establishing it, meaning I actually managed to recover mana while establishing a defensive formation. The mana regeneration perk was truly unbelievable. </p><p>After taking a few deep breaths to relax, I started drawing the next set of defensive arrays, not wanting to lose any time. She looked at me with no small amount of shock, clearly aware of just how much mana I had spent on the array. I just shrugged with a smile. </p><p>“Who are you?” she whispered, finally unable to resist the temptation, but her tone had a slight alarm as well.  </p><p>I couldn’t help but stiffen. I understood her reasoning, as I had shown, and continuing to show, an impressive number of nonstandard abilities, making her wary even after I had saved her life. I guessed that from the extra effort I had to put in the ambush, she knew that I was weaker than her. She would have just cut through the ambush and freed herself and the hostage. But I was revealing too many diverse abilities to make her feel comfortable. </p><p> If it was someone else, or her under different circumstances, I would have just ignored the question, or outright rejected it, abandoning them to their fate. She was different, not because she hid an amazing body underneath her robes —though it didn’t hurt— but because the necromancers were clearly stronger than I had first assumed —both in and out of the school— and she was the only one I could trust to be against them. It meant that sooner or later, our paths would cross. It would be more useful if she had good feelings toward me.  </p><p>“That’s a complicated question,” I murmured, which, technically, was honest and true. Before that fateful day, who I was was obvious, but every day after that, it was getting more and more blurred. Just a week ago, I was scurrying around like a rat as I tried to peek on the students, but here, in the cave, accompanied by one of the strongest mages of the Silver Spires, preparing to face against a horde of undead led by more than a dozen necromancers… The answer was getting more blurry than I had expected. “But you can say that I’m trying to find myself,” I answered. </p><p>“Interesting place to look,” she answered, and for the first time, I saw a genuine smile of amusement on her face. </p><p>“Can’t argue with the results,” I answered with a shrug even as I drew yet another rune to establish a defensive trench at the entrance, littered with several fire and earth runes. I didn’t want the cave to be filled with the skeletons. “The school has interesting opportunities for clarity,” I murmured, though I looked at her pointedly, revealing yet another secret to her against my better judgment. I hoped that it wouldn’t explode to my face. </p><p>To her credit, her only reaction was a widening of her eyes, understanding my point. With my abilities, if I had been a genuine student, everyone would have recognized me, and she already knew the rest of the teaching staff and notable guards. Which left only a few options, I was either a stowaway, or I was a staff that was hiding his abilities, both having rather dangerous implications considering no one had noticed my presence. </p><p>“Yeah, neither the guards nor the wards really work to keep a sneaky intruder out,” I said, answering her concerns before she could answer. Yes, my role as staff had given me a big advantage, but even without that, I could sneak in with half of my current abilities. </p><p>“Maybe you can share some ideas to improve security,” she offered, revealing another benefit of my last statement. For her, the security of the school was more important than delving deeper into my identity. It was a small advantage, but an advantage nonetheless.  </p><p>“I would like that,” I said even as I put the finishing touches for yet another magical exploding trap. “But let’s handle our current problem first. Our biggest threat is their necrotic bolts. Those hurt a lot, and even with our defenses, there’s no guarantee that we can avoid if all of them attack at the same time.” </p><p>“True, but why do I feel like you already have an idea?” she answered. </p><p>I smirked in response. “Not a workable one,” I answered with a frown. “Not yet, at least,” I added before crouching next to her and quickly scribbling a few symbols on the ground. “I’m trying to establish a deflection field based on life energy, and using arcana to shape and stabilize, but I’m still having problems.” </p><p>“Arcana, elemental, and biomancy,” she murmured. “That’s an interesting selection.” </p><p>“It works for me,” I said, dismissing that line of inquiry. We didn’t have time, and even if we did, I had already revealed more than I was comfortable with. My leveling strategy could wait for the second date. “Do you have any idea how I can make this ward work?” I added, deflecting her question. </p><p>That launched a rather lengthy discussion about the comparative advantages of different ward schemes. I managed to surprise her more than a few times with my innovative approaches, but it was nothing compared to how much I had learned. Even if warding was not a focus area for her, her experience still towered mine an incredible amount, allowing me to figure out a lot of new applications for my stationary magic. Luckily, with my intelligence and wisdom scores, it had been rather easy to memorize every single word that left her mouth. Her words were truly treasures, especially considering she was the caretaker of the —second— biggest information repository of the world. </p><p>[Tempting Tutoring: Impress a sexy educator with your impressive learning capabilities. +1000 Experience, +3 Intelligence]</p><p>I could see the signs of her approval, but the system’s confirmation was always welcome, though three points increase from that was a surprise. I knew she was impressed because she holding herself back, revealing more theorems and secrets in half an hour than I was able to dig out in the library since my awakening, though, considering her survival was highly dependent on my performance, maybe it wasn’t that surprising. </p><p>A while later, I stood up, drawing another set of runes to establish the nodes even as I continued to talk with her. I was moving, because my mana finally recovered, and I didn’t want to waste a second of regeneration. More defensive encampments we had, the better. Of course, I took time to heal both her and myself to full health. </p><p>[+310 HP]</p><p>[-245 Mana]</p><p>Soon, my new array took shape, creating a subtly glowing wall of arcana energy, but with the warm sensation of life magic. I just hoped that it would work better than we had hoped against the necrotic energy. After being hit by their attack several times, I didn’t fancy struggling to defend a chokehold under a rain of their disgusting death bolts. </p><p>“So, why exactly you were chasing that guy with such anger,” I asked even as I started working on the escape tunnel, in case things got too bad too fast. </p><p>“He stole a precious book of mine,” she answered. </p><p>“It must be really precious,” I answered even as my mind shifted to the vault. After failing to use a shade, it must be the next strategy. “By the way, I remember having to kill a shade yesterday, which, now that I’m thinking about it, was suspiciously close to the library, and was about to enter the faculty residence. Do you think it might be about that?” I said. At this point, considering everything else I had revealed, it was hardly a secret. </p><p>“Maybe-” she started, but before she could say anything else, a rumbling sound reached our ears, most likely from a bone dragon trying to push himself through a tight spot. “They are here,” she said. </p><p>“About time,” I answered even as I squeezed my fists, excited to test my new toys. “How is your mana situation? Do you think you can defend yourself here alone?”</p><p>“I have enough mana for a few big spells,” she answered, though her expression confused. “Considering they wouldn’t be stupid enough to push through the defenses blindly, I should be able to resist for several minutes without trouble. Why?” </p><p>“I was thinking about some creative greeting.” </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p> [Level: 17    Experience: 149150 / 153000 </p><p>Strength: 18    Charisma: 27</p><p>Precision: 13    Perception: 14</p><p>Agility: 17     Manipulation: 20</p><p>Speed: 15       Intelligence: 20</p><p>Endurance: 14      Wisdom: 21</p><p>HP: 1309 / 1309    Mana: 1685 / 1734        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>[Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Expert Arcana [75/75]   </p><p>Expert  Elemental [75/75]</p><p>Expert Biomancy [75/75]     </p><p>Advanced Subterfuge [50/50]         </p><p>Basic Speech [25/25]        ]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p>",

    "content": "<p>My shout of warning arrived at the last second, because a moment later, twelve figures donned in black robes stepped into the opening, their hands already glowing with necromantic energy. The stirrings of the array increased while twelve webs of energy spread, each centered on a necromancer. Then, they connected, creating a cage with a domineering presence, impossible to escape even someone as formidable as the librarian. </p><p>Meanwhile, the one that had been escaping from the librarian had stopped just outside of the cage, showing, a blob of purple energy coalescing around him, with a distinct sense of aggressiveness that the cage lacked. However, despite all, it wasn’t satisfaction in his eyes but anger. “Kill the intruder!” he shouted even as he pushed his energy to the cage, his attack amplified greatly by the array itself. </p><p>However, the attack flickered, its structure losing its balance halfway thanks to the destruction of some of the nodes. Combined with my early warning, the librarian managed to react in time. She raised her hand, and a wall of light appeared between the attack and her. </p><p>My eyes widened, because I didn’t know what she had used, not just the specific spell, but the category of the spell itself. It wasn’t arcana, elemental, or life energy, but something completely different. Whatever it was, however, it was far more potent than anything I could achieve. Even with some of the nodes destroyed, the necromantic attack was enough to erase me from existence just by a glancing touch, but the wall managed to resist its presence just with several deep cracks, protecting the librarian behind completely as well. </p><p>Even more impressively, a wave of her hand transformed the wall into an arrow, which slammed onto the cage mercilessly, making it shimmer dangerously. Unfortunately, the cage was too strong to be destroyed in one move, and it recovered after a momentarily dimming. </p><p>I wanted to watch more, as even a glance at such a high-level confrontation taught me a lot about magical combat. However, the sound of arrows cutting through the air took precedence, forcing me to turn away, only to see almost a hundred skeleton archers aiming at me with a second volley. I cast a wind wall, knocking the arrows away. Then, without lowering my hand, I flicked my fingers, and sending a low-level fireball in the middle of the formation. It wasn’t strong enough to destroy the skeletons, but the same couldn’t be said for their bows, their strings turning ash instantly, removing the danger from the stray arrows.  </p><p>[-35 Mana]</p><p>Too bad that the skeleton archers were the smallest of my challenges. Behind them, I could see seven figures already casting spells, their bodies burning with necromantic energy. They didn’t feel as strong as the ones currently managing the array, but they were strong enough to be a threat. Though, they weren’t as scary as the three hulking figures appeared next to them. Three bone dragons. </p><p>Under the threat of a combined magical and melee assault thick enough to overwhelm me, the solution was obvious. I slammed my hand on the floor, triggering an earth elemental spell, raising a huge dust wave. I was already casting a second spell as the dust rose, creating an identical copy of my life signature, then a third spell to hide my own, before I started running away. </p><p>[-26 Mana]</p><p>[+3 Biomancy]</p><p>As I departed, several of necrotic energy passed the space I had been occupying just moments ago, but one of them had a worse aim than the others, and his bolt of energy moved wide, hitting my shoulder instead. </p><p>[-147 HP] </p><p>I couldn’t help but wince as a horrible pain pulsated in my body, and I lost a tenth of my health, but I gritted my teeth and continued to run away. I didn’t cast a spell to hide its effect, afraid that they would notice the discrepancy between my life signature and the mana flare. It was the same reason I had been relying on my physical power only to escape.  </p><p>The curtain of dust was thick enough to cut their sight for a long while. Unfortunately, they were smart enough to realize the problem in just a few seconds. “It’s a decoy! Find him!” shouted one of them even as their attack shape changed, using wide waves that swept the floor instead of bolts. </p><p>Luckily, I was already next to a large stone. With my agility and speed, it took a second for me to rapidly climb through its rough surface, avoiding their assault. And if there was one good thing about being in the middle of a necromancer camp, I didn’t have to worry about any living creature. Their defenses had since long secured the area. </p><p>A sudden downpour of rain suddenly appeared in the opening, suppressing the dust, but it was too late for them. I was already hidden from their view. “Where is he?” called one of them.</p><p>“He is clearly hiding! Find him!” shouted the leader once more. I continued running away, confident in my success not only because of my stealth skills, but also thanks to the blanketing effect created by the battle between the librarian and her ambushers. </p><p>I stalled for a moment, trying to decide what to do next. I had underestimated the presence of the enemy. Even with a dozen of them locked in a battle with the librarian, they still had enough in reserve to completely overwhelm me. I could escape easily under the coverage of the librarian’s battle, but its final result was still in doubt. The librarian was stronger than I had estimated, but so was the ambushers with the support from the arrays. If I ran away, there was no guarantee who would be the victor. </p><p>However, facing them directly was not an option either, not when I had to defeat seven necromancers, three bone dragons, and numerous other critters… Luckily, they had other points of vulnerability, and I was thoroughly concealed. I stopped for a moment, using my perception to identify the location of the other nodes, which was shining distinctively in their active state. </p><p>I moved to the most distant location before starting to destroy the nodes. Destruction of the first four went unnoticed, but when the fifth node fell apart under my magical attack, a loud cry escaped the mouth of their leader. “He’s destroying the nodes in the northeast, you idiots!” he cried in warning, his voice enhanced magically. </p><p>Since he was kind enough to alert me, I dashed away before they could arrive, moving to the west section of the array, and destroyed three more until he managed to raise an alarm. “He’s attacking the east now, you idiots! He slipped away from your attack. Spread out and prevent him from destroying it!” </p><p>I stopped destroying the nodes once again, but this time, I didn’t run away, instead, climbed on top of a large rock that was towering above the only feasible path from the northeast section, holding as much as mana as I could without glowing like a lighthouse. </p><p>When two necromancers and a bone dragon appeared on the opening, accompanied by a horde of skeletons, I was ready. I waited as the dragon passed and the skeleton brigade started to pass. Necromancers were in the middle, standing next to each other, mana shields shining in their hands, ready to destroy any magical attack, their eyes dancing wildly. </p><p>Unfortunately, they trusted the skeletons to guard their immediate surroundings. So, when I jumped down from the rock when they were directly under me, they were too late to react. I swiped the sword once, and one head flew off, blood spraying wildly. “Goodbye,” I said even as I swung my sword, ready to decapitate the second one. </p><p>That didn’t work as well as I intended. I succeeded in decapitating part, but this time, there was no blood spray, just a decayed neck, made of bone and sinews. </p><p>“Try again,” cackled the flying head even as the body lifted its staff and slammed me with the energy he created by breaking the shield. I threw myself back, rolling with the attack, doing my best to avoid slashes of the skeletons gathering around me, but with limited success. Luckily, I still had HP to spare. </p><p>[-97 HP]</p><p>I couldn’t help but feel excited as I found myself face to face with a lich supported by a significant army. The body of the lich raised its hand and sent a flare, no doubt summoning his compatriots. “Perfect,” I murmured. Not only I had to face a full-blown lich, a bone dragon that was currently charging toward me, and almost a hundred skeleton warriors, but also I had to finish it before the reinforcements arrived. </p><p>One good thing about it was with my position revealed, I didn’t have to pull back. I pushed a generous blob of life energy into my sword, making it glow brightly, enough to make the skeletons around me a step back, giving me the opportunity I needed. </p><p>[-120 Mana] </p><p>[+2 Biomancy]</p><p>I dashed forward toward the lich’s head, aware that my makeshift enchantment wouldn’t last more than a few seconds. My sword danced like a snake, the skeletons helpless against my master melee skill, especially when a good strike was enough to unravel their cursed existence thanks to the enchantment. </p><p>The body of the lich positioned itself between me and the head, its full-frame glowing with the necrotic experience. From the unstable way it glowed, I didn’t have a good impression of what was awaiting me. I lunged forward even as I waved my empty hand, desperately trying to create a brand new biomancy spell. </p><p>The purple energy was already pulsating as the beginning of an overwhelming wave when I pushed my sword into its heart, using it to inject more life energy into its body. </p><p>[-673 Mana]</p><p>[+1 Biomancy]</p><p>My desperate innovation attempt succeeded only partially, turning its body into a pile of ash, but its spell stayed partially intact, hitting my body violently. </p><p>[-364 HP]</p><p>Being in the ground zero of a lich’s desperate ultimate attack was not fun, I noted. I could see its head a few feet away, unaffected by its area-effect spell, unlike the skeletons, moving with a renewed energy. It was one of the most annoying aspects of fighting against Necromancers, they were free to use their area effect spells without fearing hurting their minions, as the necrotic energy enhanced them instead. </p><p>I cast a simple arcana bolt to its head, which fell apart easily, signaling that its soul had used the opportunity to escape. Their ability to send their soul back to their soul container was one of the things that transformed the challenge level from difficult to nightmare. </p><p>There was a limit to the range of effectiveness of the soul container, and under normal conditions, though still measured in miles. I might have searched for it under better circumstances, but the sound of bone dragon closing in didn’t allow me to chase such luxuries. </p><p>Such as running away from an enraged bone dragon. The only good thing about destroying the necromancers was that the bone dragon had no controller anymore, so it was limited to blindly chasing me. I dashed back to the rocky part of the canyon, cutting and weaving through the skeleton warriors, once again using my melee skill to maximum benefit, running to my maximum capability even if I had to take a few blows I would have avoided normally. </p><p>It was well worth it, because the bone dragon was just a step away when I stepped into the passage, leaving it to crash violently against the thick stone wall before starting to dig with all of its undead single-mindedness. Secure, I used my biomancy to great effect once more, this time to heal myself. </p><p>[-320 Mana]</p><p>[+286 HP]</p><p>The agonizing pain had turned into an annoying buzz. I was glad to see that I had almost reached a parity between my mana spent and hitpoint recovered. I started running, but not before I left another decoy, more than enough to trick the mindless bone dragon. Then, I created a weaker, but still noticeable decoy, and sent it toward the south, hoping that it would distract the others. </p><p>Then, I sent a pulse of biomancy energy to detect their locations, to make a better plan about the next step. I couldn’t help but smile excitedly as I realized that in their hurry to protect the arrays, the undead army had moved toward the periphery, leaving the center open. </p><p>Big mistake on their part. </p><p>Thanks to the limited mental capabilities of most of my enemies, it wasn’t much of a challenge to avoid them, though occasionally I had to use some elemental tricks to create shortcuts, my mana surges obscured by the ever-increasing effects of battle in the center of the array. </p><p>When I arrived at the center, I met with an amazing sight. The librarian was still trapped in the middle of the array, defending herself with her unique light magic and using the same magic to batter on the walls of her prison instead. She looked exhausted, but it didn’t alarm me, because her attackers were in an even worse state, furiously trying to keep the array stable. Even their leader was exhausted, more focused on stabilizing the array rather than trying to attack. </p><p>Still, a battle was an uncertain thing, and there was still a chance that the librarian might lose. I decided to tip the balance in her favor more. The necromancers were too focused on the threat she represented, so they failed to notice my presence as I sneaked toward them. My target noticed my presence as I swung my sword, but it was too late. With his focus and his magic dedicated to stabilizing the damaged array, before he could make a sound, his head was already gone. </p><p>“It’s an ambush,” shouted the leader as he looked at me before he sent a warning flare. “Everyone, come back!” he ordered, his voice enhanced. If the supporting army returned from all angles, they would trap me in place, making it impossible for me to escape alone. </p><p>Luckily, I wasn’t alone. Even better, with the death of one of them, they had to focus all their attention on the ward just to prevent themselves from burning. Combined wards were dangerous when things were going bad. The librarian was smart enough to see the opportunity, and cast a much brighter spell, this time directly to attack rather than a modified defense spell. </p><p>The result was spectacular. Her prison shimmered and weakened, looking like it was about to shatter. I cast a fireball to leverage the opportunity, injuring two more necromancers enough for them to lose their control, burning up as a result. </p><p>[-65 Mana]</p><p>I was hoping that the battle was about to end, but then the leader proved that there was a reason for his post. “Cancel the prison!” he shouted, and before I could take the opportunity to kill another necromancer, the librarian’s prison shattered. Meanwhile, the reinforcements arrived in the form of five necromancers and three bone dragons. </p><p>Luckily, I had reinforcements of my own. But when I looked at the eyes of the librarian, I could see the exhaustion dancing in her eyes. The trap took more than I had been expecting. I looked around, and detected the east section was the weakest. I gestured her to attack that side, while I turned toward the leader, gathering as much as mana as I could, turning it into life energy. </p><p>It wasn’t surprising that between the librarian and me, they decided to attack me first, reasonably taking me as the easier target, while sending the bone dragons to delay the librarian, supported by a few necromancers. That was a mistake from their end, because even exhausted, the librarian was able to deflect them without even slowing down. </p><p>“You have messed with the wrong person,” said the leader as he walked toward me, his hands burning with necrotic energy, his intention was clear. He looked confident, understandable considering I was surrounded by ten necromancers and a lot of skeletons. Unluckily for them, most of them were still exhausted by operating the array. </p><p>The leader realized his mistake when he realized the spell in my hands was growing without a limit. He threw a bolt of energy to me hurriedly, but it was too late. I let my spell, the strongest I had cast to date. It was a biomancy nova, filling the canyon with life energy. </p><p>[-1230 Mana]</p><p>[+5 Biomancy]</p><p>Despite almost completely emptying my mana, the spell wasn’t as strong as I would have liked. The skeletons were all destroyed, their weak structure unable to resist the area effect spell. The necromancers were, unfortunately, stayed alive -for a given value considering their occupation- but they were distracted, not to mention shocked by my spell. So, when I followed it with another dust spell to hide from their view, their first reflex was to shield themselves, ready to protect themselves. </p><p>That gave me the time to follow the opening the librarian had created, saving me from the envelopment. Soon, I caught up with the librarian. “Good, you managed to get away,” she said, but when I noticed a slight slurring in her tone, I realized that the escape would be even more difficult than I had first assumed. </p><p>We dashed away at the full speed, hoping to avoid our pursuers, at least avoiding them enough to recover some mana, as currently, I was running on fumes. Though, a smile appeared on my face when I received a notification the moment the last skeleton disappeared in my field of view. </p><p>[Deadly Departure: Rescue a damsel in distress from a deadly ambush in a great personal risk, impressing her greatly in the process. +2000 Experience, +2 Speed, +2 Charisma]</p><p>It was shaping out to be an interesting adventure…</p><p><br></p><p> [Level: 17    Experience: 148150 / 153000 </p><p>Strength: 18    Charisma: 27</p><p>Precision: 13    Perception: 14</p><p>Agility: 17     Manipulation: 20</p><p>Speed: 15       Intelligence: 17</p><p>Endurance: 14      Wisdom: 21</p><p>HP: 967 / 1309    Mana: 93 / 1683        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>[Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Expert Arcana [75/75]   </p><p>Expert  Elemental [75/75]</p><p>Expert Biomancy [75/75]     </p><p>Advanced Subterfuge [50/50]         </p><p>Basic Speech [25/25]        ]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p><br></p>",

    "content": "<p>I could feel the eyes on me as I took the seat, some with anger, some with disbelief, and a few with pity. After all, for them, I was the young idiot that intruded into a game between very dangerous people just because I wanted to impress a girl. Funny, considering the only one that actually made me feel tense was the girl itself. Pity that I needed to tease her. </p><p>They distributed the first cards, I quickly glanced at the cards, seeing that it was a three and seven of different colors, complete garbage to play, so I threw them to the side. I might have tried to bluff under normal circumstances, but both Brad and Thomas were looking at me with fire in their eyes. The probability of them charging forward thoughtlessly was significant. I needed to wait for a better hand. </p><p>The challenge was doing so without creating an impression of a careful player. Luckily, I had the perfect excuse for that. After throwing the cards toward the middle dismissively, I turned toward the girl that lay in the heart of the battle. “Good evening, you magnificent beauty. May I be bequeathed with your splendid name,” I said, intentionally using an unnecessarily thick diction, one that might be mistaken for elegance and class by the brutes that surrounded the table with more brawn than culture. </p><p>She giggled and her eyes slid to the floor, the textbook signs of attraction, much to the anger of my supposed rivals. However, I noticed something that they missed. Her irises didn’t move a bit, nor did a blush appear on her face, showing that it was a measured response. “Sabrina,” she answered in a slight gaspy voice, perfect for driving the other two into a rage. </p><p>I did nothing to disrupt her little game, as the anger of my opponents was to my benefit. I even kissed the hand that she presented, fueling their fury. The angrier they were, the harder it was for them to play coherently, a deadly mistake in poker. Of course, making the game personal would earn me two semi-significant enemies, not that it bothered me. I was just here for a week, and the mission didn’t require me to step outside the resort, which itself was one of the safest places as long as one didn’t cross the management. </p><p>“And your name is?” she asked as she shifted in her seat, exuding shyness. </p><p>“I’m Michael,” I said pompously even as I checked my cards once more, only to see a pair of queens, an excellent hand to play. Still, I made a motion like I was about to fold while turning my gaze back to Sabrina, my sexy bait. “Tech genius and investor extraordinaire.” </p><p>“Are you going to play or not!” exclaimed Brad, clearly unhappy with the amount of attention Sabrina was lavishing on me. He took the bait. </p><p>“Such uncivilized behavior,” I murmured in disappointment as I looked at him. Sabrina nodded along, making him feel ashamed, which, of course, made him even angrier at me, like I was responsible for the actions of a girl I met just a minute ago. “Still, if you want to lose some money, who am I to argue?” With that, I pushed fifty thousand dollars on the table, ten times the current bet. </p><p>Most of the nameless players chose to pull back from the game, though two of them stayed in the game. Their disappointment was clear when Brad opened his mouth. “A million dollars,” he called as he pushed his money on the table, his gaze bouncing between me and Sabrina. It was a big decision, to push all of my money to the table, which would have left me almost penniless, forcing me to ask for more funds from the Agency. Considering the suspicions about the calamity Agent Brown experienced, it wasn’t a risk I wanted to take. </p><p>Still, considering I had to reach nine figures in a couple of days just to get access to my real mission location, I didn’t have the luxury of playing it safe. I decided to bet on the extreme confidence Brad was displaying while trying to hide the slight tremble in his hands. If he was good enough to fake that, I was already screwed, so I decided to take a leap of faith. </p><p>It was Thomas’ turn before mine, and he pushed a million without saying anything, his eyes on me. “Don’t be too rash to lose, boys,” I said even as I pushed all the money in front of me to the table, giving no outward display of my panic. It was a trick I had learned during my grittier days, before my recruitment to the agency. No matter what, always maintain the demeanor required by the scam. </p><p>I pushed a look of disappointment on my face when the dealer flipped open another queen in the first round, trying to hide the fact that I likely had a winning hand. It was an unbelievable stroke of luck. Pity that I lacked the proper funds to leverage it. “How about we put up ten million more,” Thomas said, looking ecstatic at my perfectly-played disappointment. </p><p>“I would have liked to take more of your money, but alas, I lack the liquid funds required,” I said, doing my best to look relieved by that fact, even glancing at Sabrina like I was trying to check my trick had been noticed. </p><p>“Not a big issue,” Thomas said with a laugh. “You mentioned that you were a tech entrepreneur, right? You can always put your shares as collateral.” </p><p>“Is that allowed?” I turned and asked the dealer, once again desperation clear in my tone. </p><p>“Only if all the other players in the current game agree,” the dealer answered. “However, our casino makes no guarantee about the existence or the valuation of the assets mentioned, so any dispute will need to be handled between you gentlemen.” </p><p>“Excellent,” Thomas jumped, his laugh making his belly jiggle. “I’m sure Brad is more than happy to accept your bet,” he continued, and Brad nodded in approval, his smile like a shark. “Ten million,” Thomas said as he pushed a sizable stack of chips in the middle of the table. </p><p>I looked hesitant before pulling out a napkin, and quickly scribbling a promissory note worth ten million, with my imaginary company as collateral with little hesitancy. Unlike the money, the company wasn’t worth anything, and I could afford to lose it. At worst, I would receive an earful from the Agency for losing a well-crafted cover identity. When I pushed that forward, Brad joined the game in an instant, and the dealer flipped two more cards, which included another queen in the mix. Pity that they had no obligation to accept another promissory note. </p><p>“Let’s see what you have,” said Thomas as he flipped his cards, revealing a pair of pocket aces, the most dangerous cards to start the game with because of the fake confidence that they gave its handlers. With another ace revealed as the fourth card, Thomas had three-of-a-kind. Even Brad smirked joyfully at the scene, happy about my defeat even if he lost ten million in the process, which forced me to refresh my opinion about their real worth. They were clearly richer than I first assumed. </p><p>“Too bad for you,” I said evenly as I revealed the pair in my hand, and their expression of elation evaporated in an instant. I let out a gentle smile as I pulled the money to me, not neglecting to flip a white chip worth a hundred thousand dollars to the dealer, who nodded in appreciation. </p><p>“Impossible,” Thomas choked in anger, and Brad’s reaction was not that different. I smiled as I looked at the impressive pile of money in front of me, finally giving me hope about the fate of my mission. With that much seed money, even playing against normal opponents, I could easily complete the first step of my mission. </p><p>“Nothing is impossible, gentlemen,” I said even as the second round of the cards were distributed, before turning to Sabrina once again, wanting to turn their anger into a true fury. “So, my beautiful lady, what brings you here,” I said. </p><p>Before she could answer, Brad subtly poked the guy next to him, and he spoke. “Sabrina, how do you think your brother will react when he hears about this,” he said. From the way the rest of the table, including Thomas and Brad, stiffened at the mention of him, I felt myself panicking a little as well. </p><p>I hated acting without proper intelligence. </p><p>“I don’t know which one you’re talking about,” Sabrina answered with a tone that must have been mistaken for genuine confusion for the rest of the table, her big brown eyes widened appropriately. “But my brothers are the kindest men I know, they wouldn’t even threaten a fly.” From the expressions that appeared around the table, it didn’t take a genius to realize it was a rather big misinterpretation. </p><p>Then, she turned to me. “We’re here for some family time,” she answered with a shy smile, making me struggle to hide my sudden stiffening. Her hidden expertise and acting ability were dangerous enough. The fact that two rich boys with obvious illegal roots were fighting for her was worse. But the fact that her family caused that kind of reaction was something else.</p><p>I suddenly realized that I had made my already difficult mission even more complicated. </p><p>Still, what was done was done, and playing more wouldn’t do any harm. “How interesting,” I answered her even as I pushed a modest amount of chips to the table as the game started once more, acting like the game didn’t deserve my attention. “I’m sure the rest of your family is as lovely as you.” </p><p>The next hour was filled with an intense poker game, but I acted like my attention was on Sabrina. At first, I played badly intentionally, losing several games in a row, but never losing more than a few hundred thousand at any single game, avoiding direct confrontation with my rivals, then winning a couple of big games, compensating for the deficiencies in my funds, all while aggressively flirting with Sabrina, who, for some reason continued to react to my advances like a shy girl smitten by a prince. Gripped by their anger, Brad and Thomas made mistake after mistake, until my pile of chips finally overwhelmed theirs.</p><p>“That’s my brother calling,” she said after an hour of flirting, looking very disappointed to have cut our discussion short. </p><p>“A pity that I’m going to lose my lady luck,” I answered with a playful smirk, subtly gesturing at the pile of chips that finally passed a hundred million, earning me the title of VIP player. I still needed more to be a part of the auction, but I finally had access to upstairs, where the real action lay. </p><p>When she presented her hand, I didn’t pause a moment before grabbing her fingers gently and slowly bringing them to my lips. Once again, she managed to surprise me, this time by slipping a small card into my hand that felt suspiciously like a room key. </p><p>Yet another complication to my mission, I thought as I watched her walk away, her voluptuous hips dancing with each step like they were trying to cut free from her beautiful blue dress. Getting involved with such a dangerous woman with an equally dangerous family without knowing anything about them was ill-advised. </p><p>Too bad that the alliance of my curiosity and my arousal was stronger than my sense of survival. </p><p>“So, gentleman,” I said as I turned to the table while gesturing to a waitress to bring me another drink. “Are you ready to play for real?” </p><p>“That’s enough for me,” Thomas spat in anger, gathered his chips, and left, followed by several players. Brad, on the other hand, proved that his emotions were stronger than his common sense, and stayed in the game. We played for two more hours, which ended up with me reaching two hundred million dollars, mostly because Brad had replenished his chips several times despite the advice of his friends. </p><p>“You made yourself a powerful enemy today,” Brad said. “I advise you to spend your earnings to buy a nice coffin, you’ll need it soon.” </p><p>I waved my hand dismissively, not even bothering to reply as I gestured toward yet another provocatively-dressed assistant with an hourglass figure, this time a redhead, to gather and record my chips, throwing another hundred-thousand as a tip before standing up. Only then did I check the card Sabrina had passed to me, and read the scribbled note on the back, showing a room number, as well as a short invitation, asking me to visit her for a private dinner. </p><p>Accepting was risky, but ignoring it was even riskier. After all, I had seen her sabotage two suitors just because she was feeling slightly annoyed. With the shadow of her mysterious family looming behind her, angering her was an even worse challenge. Not to mention I was still curious about her identity, and more importantly, how she looked without that blue dress. </p><p>Since I still had two hours until the proposed dinner date, I walked around the casino and started playing several games such as roulette, losing and earning millions, looking like a careless player, just another part of my identity, even though numbers were dancing in my mind to minimize my loss. </p><p>Normally, gaining even a bronze VIP card took months of consistent visits. I was betting that my aggressive and careless betting would compensate for it. After all, there was nothing casinos liked more than money, even a unique one like the Sapphire Palace. I was betting that aggressive gambling with a budget of almost two hundred million would expedite the process. </p><p>Half an hour before the time proposed by Sabrina, I decided to stop gambling, and I still needed to change. So, I walked to the connected residential section. </p><p>I observed my surroundings as I walked forward, taking note of my surroundings. A well-designed opulence greeted me at the reception, its vast opening covered with tasteful marble statues and priceless paintings. As usual, the lobby was crowded, though several people on the bar, sitting in a deceptive impression of laziness, caught my attention. Undercover bodyguards of the hotel, I noted. Considering the client base, the hotel took the security seriously. </p><p>It was all well, because I could see Brad sitting on a table as well, surrounded by a number of people with the distinctive physique of high-class bodyguards, glaring daggers at me. And, the numerous scars of his bodyguard told me that they were familiar with the violence. </p><p>“I’ll be at the casino tomorrow at eleven,” I said cheerfully even as I walked toward the elevator, not even bothering to stop. “Why don’t you drop by, maybe your luck will turn.” </p><p>“You’re dancing on your grave,” Brad growled back, but when one of his bodyguards stood up in anger, he was quick to pull him back. As he pulled back, however, the shirt of his bodyguard slid, revealing a distinctive tattoo on his lower neck. The sign of the Dominion Cartel, one of the biggest drug distributors in the States. </p><p>“Fuck,” I murmured as I stepped in the elevator. I had expecting Brad to have a notable background after the show around him, and the money he lost, but I didn’t expect him to be a part of major families, at least the son of a high-ranking official considering the number of bodyguards he brought with him to the Island of Trinania, a location that forbade violence with great effectiveness. </p><p>No help crying over spilled milk, I decided. “Floor fifteen,” I said as I turned to look at the elevator operator, once again a well-dressed hottie, and spent the brief travel enjoying the sight. Then, I went to my room, which was on the standard level of the hotel, enough room just for a bed and a closet, despite the thousands I got charged every night. </p><p>In there, I changed from my tux into something more comfortable, a black t-shirt and blazer combo, tight enough to display my muscles, completing the set with a pair of washed jeans. It wasn’t the height of fashion, but it was more than sufficient for a private meeting, adding a certain ruggedness to my charm. </p><p>After that was finished, I went back to the elevator once more. “Fifty-four,” I asked the operator, and when she looked at me in askance, I flashed the card Sabrina had passed me. Floors between forty and sixty were for bronze tier VIPs, which required an invitation to enter. </p><p>Soon, I was ringing Sabrina’s door. I hadn’t had to wait long, because the door opened in an instant, revealing Sabrina, but in a very different dress. Gone was the innocent blue dress, replaced by a red one with deep cleavage, and an equally impressive slit that revealed her leg with each step. </p><p>“Welcome,” she gasped, her eyes widening with an innocent excitement that contrasted with her revealing dress, making her look like the nerdy daughter of the house that stole her sister’s dress to look sexy, but failed to fill the role. </p><p>All fake, of course. It seemed that she was intent on playing her role. Curious, I thought as I stepped inside, desperately trying to ignore the saying about cats, curiosity, and their ultimate fate. </p><p>I had a feeling that satisfaction’s restorative qualities were rather overblown. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I tried to hide my nervousness as I strolled into the world’s most infamous casino, the Sapphire Palace. This casino was known as the Jewel of Trinania, a small island country in the middle of the Pacific, making enough money to fund a significant minority of the country’s budget just by taxing a sliver of its income. Famous for high rollers from all countries of the world, from princes of the oil-rich Middle-Eastern countries to aged owners of famous conglomerates, some rich enough to build forts from actual money if they wished so, used it to gamble away their fortunes, sometimes the entirety of it. With every shake of the dice, every flip of a card, enough money to bankrupt a small country changed hands. </p><p>I was nervous because I wasn’t supposed to be here. I wasn’t a spare prince to some third-world county, flush with oil and diamond money, nor was I the spoiled spawn of a rich businessman who assumed a rich bank account was a sufficient replacement for actual parenting. I wasn’t even a spoiled young entrepreneur whose idea had taken the world by storm, itching with a desire to prove himself against the old money, though it was the role I was playing. </p><p>I was a spy. And I was in the heart of Trinania, one of the most dangerous places for a spy. </p><p>It wasn’t hyperbole. The casino part of the Sapphire Palace saw billions changing hands every day, and that was only the public facet of it. The real events of significance happened in the private room, hidden deals and forbidden auctions, where everything from nuclear weapon schematics to actual armies changed hands. </p><p>Therefore, the casino was packed with the best security in the world, enough to make the Pentagon look like a ballpark in an abandoned fast-food restaurant. They didn’t take kindly to spies, something my predecessor, Agent Brown, had learned the hard way. He was a legend in the Agency, creating miracles for the last three decades according to the Agency's gossip, only for his tale to come to a silent end. The agency still had no idea about his fate, apparently. One day, he just disappeared, with no news about him. </p><p> I wasn’t exactly feeling confident as I strolled inside. Luckily, I had a lifetime of hiding my feelings behind a cocky exterior, so I rejected the impulse to tug on the sleeves of my tuxedo, which, despite what one might assume regarding my occupation, were completely normal, free of any kind of weapon or listening device. The agency decided not to take any risk after the disappearance of Agent Brown, not knowing what triggered it. Still, the tuxedo cost high six-figures, exuding richness and elegance that I lacked. </p><p>Of course, my lack of so-called elegance was intentional. Faking the peacock strut of a rich kid wasn’t exactly the most challenging thing I had been forced to do during my two decades of life, but my alias as a small-time crook that managed to become a breakout success thanks to a few digital investments with various legalities with several tens of millions payout required me to look a bit uncomfortable with my supposed newfound wealth.</p><p>Funny that it wasn’t too far from who I had been before I was recruited into the agency -minus the big success part. It had been less than a year since I had been recruited, and normally, I was still supposed to be in training. Unfortunately, after the loss of Agent Brown, the Agency was afraid that their database might have been compromised, so they decided to send a new recruit that hadn’t been properly processed yet. </p><p>And I was the lucky sod. </p><p>I stopped reminiscing about my circumstances when I noticed someone closing in and slowed down. Then, a sexy blonde dressed in a tiny cocktail dress —though her curves begged to escape from the tight confines of her dress— closed in, carrying a small tray filled with a few stacks of chips. </p><p>The pile of chips looked deceptively small, with several black chips, a smattering of other colors, and a total of eight white chips. However, once someone knew that the smallest black chip represented a thousand dollars, while the white one represented a hundred thousand dollars. A million dollars in total. </p><p>Everywhere else, it was a fortune. </p><p>In Sapphire Palace, it was barely enough to gain admission to the lower floor. Pity that after the loss of Agent Brown, that was all the money the Agency was able to gather while making sure that their source wasn’t compromised. </p><p>“Thank you, sweetie,” I said with a pompous swagger, looking at the smiling face of the waitress, who had done her best to look impressed, but her smile didn’t reach her eyes. Understandable, considering she had to repeat the scene numerous times during the day, all while trying to convince pompous pricks about their uniqueness. While picking up the chips, I made sure to leave a ten-thousand-dollar chip on the tray, nodding to her to show that it wasn’t an accident. </p><p>There was no harm in creating goodwill with the serving staff. </p><p>Her smile turned more sincere, but my seductive smirk was fake. After all, it was neither my attraction to her nor a feeling of pity that made me tip her generously. I wanted to get some goodwill while also establishing my identity as a lavish and careless spender early on, just in case someone traced my movements.</p><p>I had a lazy strut moving around the place, acting unaware of the several gazes watching me walk, some idly, others with a careful glint as they measured the new competition. Understandable, as even with my careful dressing and calculated pompous mannerism, I belonged to the relatively rare young minority. The casino was predominantly occupied by older ladies and gentlemen.  </p><p>I walked around lazily while carefully examining my surroundings, a huge crowd around every table, going back and forth, only a raised platform in the middle as an exception, with a poker game going on. The huge pile of chips was in front of every player, easily reaching high nine-figures. I wished that I could join that game, as playing such a high-profile table would help me immensely to build a reputation, which I could then leverage to access the private wing. I needed to go there to finish my mission. </p><p>Unfortunately, a hundred million was needed to gain admission to that table, along with an invitation from at least two players, both of them I sorely lacked. </p><p>So, I started walking around, occasionally spending some time in one of the games managed by the casino like roulette and blackjack, but I made sure to keep my bets small, trying not to win or lose too much. Ultimately, those games favored the casino, and even if I knew a few ways to beat them, I needed to win a huge amount. Doing so on them would have brought unwelcome attention to my actions.</p><p>My best chance was the poker games that were going on, and even that was tricky. I walked around, only to see that most of the tables were occupied by talented professional players, playing slowly and carefully. I could beat them, but it would have been a slow and clumsy affair, with no guarantee that I would be able to meet the deadline for the auction. </p><p>Once again, I cursed Handler Silver for assigning me to this mission. Pity that I didn’t have the right to refuse. </p><p>I was about to surrender myself to sleepless nights as I desperately tried to collect the necessary amount when a loud cry stole my attention. “That’s it, loser. How does it feel to lose yet another factory,” called a young man with a carefully-groomed ponytail hair to a short man with a distinctive pot belly. The one with the ponytail looked to be in his early twenties, while the fat one was probably in his late twenties, though he looked much older. </p><p>“Don’t worry about it,” answered the shorter man, trying to hide his fury. “Deal another hand!” </p><p>It sounded like a personal grudge, and from the sound of it, it was a family grudge reflecting on the battle between two rich young heirs. </p><p>Exactly what I needed to collect my required funds. I closed in to examine them. They weren’t the only ones on the table, but the other players looked distinctly less enthusiastic about the heated battle, but from the depths of their worry, I assumed it wasn’t just about losing their money to two unbalanced players. Maybe they were supporters of each party, unhappy with the sudden increase of intensity, or maybe they were friends of both sides, unhappy about the fight. </p><p>Identifying the source of their fight was simple, because when the next game started, both of their gazes turned toward a sexy brunette sitting on the side of the table, observing the game. As I examined the beauty, I decided that their fight was justified. She had a thin figure, the kind that resulted from endless hours of careful exercise and equally careful management of her diet, though not enough to make her one of the weak models. She was elegant, but with a hint of strength underneath. </p><p>Her skin had a creamy caramel color, putting her origin to one of the Latin American countries. Her curves weren’t excessively impressive, but they fit her body type perfectly, and her blue dress highlighted them to maximum effect. She had a cute, beautiful face, one that might have tricked a less experienced man, but the clear amusement and enjoyment dancing behind her cute brown eyes as she watched two men fighting for her using their riches told a different story.  </p><p>However, the most interesting thing about her was the barely noticeable little calluses on her right hand. On the thumb and index finger, the kind one got from intensive pistol practice. She was clearly more than just a simple-minded shy wallflower she was playing as. </p><p>Objectively speaking, getting the attention of such an obvious wildcard wasn’t the best idea, it was threatening the success rate of the mission. However, without the money, the mission was doomed in any case. With the time restrictions I was facing, I needed to hit big. There was no other option.</p><p> So, before the dealer could distribute the next hand of cards, I walked to the table and spoke. “Do you mind if I join in, boys,” I said genially. </p><p>The one with the ponytail spoke immediately. “We’re kind of having a private game here,” he said without looking. </p><p>“Isn’t it a bit crowded for a private game,” I said while I let my gaze dance over the table, only to stop when my eyes fell on the Latina beauty, staying there excessively. “But I can understand why you’re trying to keep me away. It’s okay to be scared. You’re clearly afraid of losing the attention of this goddess,” I added, flirting heavily. </p><p>The girl giggled at my words, but the amusement in her eyes was of a darker variety, though the difference was difficult to spot. The only reason I was able to differentiate was my experience, sharpened by the special training I had received. </p><p>“Who do you think you are!” the ponytail guy and the fat one exclaimed at the same time, rising from their seats, though interestingly, both of their hands went to their waist for a moment before stalling, revealing that under normal circumstances, they would be carrying guns, and expected to use them to solve their problems. Luckily, such a solution was impossible in the casino, where a strict search routine was performed to ensure no weapons entered the hotel other than with the staff and rarely approved VIP customers. </p><p>I chuckled at his anger. “Why do you care who I am, when you’re obviously scared of me without even knowing anything?” I said, trying to goad him into becoming angrier. To join the game, and I need him furious, so that he could try to get revenge the only way he could. </p><p>Before he could say anything else, however, the brunette intruded. “Don’t tell me that he’s right, and you’re afraid of him, Brad?” she said with an excessive amount of shock, with just the right amount of disappointment coloring her face. Far too perfect to be natural. </p><p>“Of course I can handle him,” Brad answered, his ponytail dancing in the air as he trembled in anger, showing his poor impulse control. “If he can handle the buy-in, of course,” he continued. </p><p>“Well, I have been unlucky until now, so I’m not exactly flush with chips,” I said, trying to look a bit abashed, but before they could speak, I threw ten white chips to the table, signaling a million. Not an amazing amount of money compared to the piles in front of them, but still well-above the buy-in limit of a normal game. </p><p>“That’s not enough-” Brad started, only to stop when the brunette sent him a warning glare. “But since I want to humiliate you, I can accommodate it,” he continued. “Right, Thomas?” he asked dismissively as he turned to his fat rival. </p><p>Thomas was watching the commotion, unhappy with losing the attention of the table. Still, he proved to have a modicum of patience unlike his rival, and kept his mouth shut. He just nodded to the question, and I pulled a seat, the one closest to the brunette beauty so that I could talk with her while the game went on.</p><p>It was going to be an interesting game… </p>",

    "content": "<p>After leaving Nicole in her bedroom, used and exhausted, I took a quick stop in the bathroom to groom myself, namely, cleaning the most obvious evidence of recent sexual encounter from myself, including the taste Nicole from my shaft. I washed my face, fixed my hair, and even used the air-freshener in the room to mask the lingering smell of sex on myself. </p><p>Just as I was about to move to the basement, I remembered that my equipment was still in my car, so I made a brief detour to pick my camera. We were in a nice neighborhood, but there was a lot of confidential stuff inside, including the most recent rewards of my session with Penny, so I didn’t want to take any chances. </p><p>When I went back inside, I opened the room leading to the basement stairs very carefully even as my mind switched back to my encounters with Katie. When she had asked me to act as her boyfriend just to compete with her more popular friend Madison, I took several opportunities to steal a few kisses and gropes, seeing them as fair pay for all my efforts. However, her quick agreement to my so-called training assistance caught me a bit surprised. </p><p>Even more surprising part was our last training session, where I had arranged things perfectly until she had surrendered her virginity in a momentary loss of attention from her own part, then, at my urging, decided to turn it into an advantage. </p><p>Careful to make any sound, I managed to arrive at the bottom of the stairs without being caught. I looked around to see Katie, only to meet a view that was enough to make my manhood twitch despite the exhausting challenge it just went through. Katie was standing in front of a mirror, her attention firmly on her reflection, wearing nothing but a white garter belt and a pair of white stockings. Combined with her petite figure and her blonde hair, she was the perfect innocent angel. </p><p>I sat on the stairs, watching as she posed in front of the mirror several times, her blush visible from the other end of the room, but she somehow failed to notice me. She reached for her phone and took several pictures, recording her reflection on the mirror, but despite that, my phone didn’t ring. I understood the reason a moment later, when she checked her camera, only to blush spectacularly. She took another photo, this time her legs positioned carefully to hide her core while her arm was covering her breasts once more. This time, however, it was placed lower so there was a hint of areola in her picture. </p><p>‘I’m getting bored,’ read the message she sent to me, followed by her picture. </p><p>“We can find a solution for that,” I said as I started walking toward her. </p><p>The cute yelp that escaped her mouth was spectacular as she crouched down, trying to hide her body. “Stephen, you’re here,” she stammered in shock. </p><p>“Of course,” I said as I casually walked toward her. “How could I not be here, when I have such an enthusiastic student, impatient for her teacher’s arrival.” </p><p>“Shut up,” she murmured, but a smile infected her face despite her best effort. </p><p>“Are you going to stay like that?” I said, gesturing her crouched pose, trying to hide her body. “I think we’re well-past this point.” </p><p>“Shut up,” Katie shouted, but the following giggle was enough to tell her good intention. She took a deep breath before standing up, though she stood with and angle, her own hips hiding her core while her arm stayed around her breasts. </p><p>“As you wish,” I said and chuckled. Then gestured my camera. “I didn’t expect you to enjoy dressing up though. It was a nice surprise.” </p><p>“It’s your fault,” she pouted, but as she pouted, she finally pulled her arm away from her chest, giving me a direct view of her shapely breasts, making me desire to fill them with my hands. </p><p>“Why?” </p><p>“You forced me to undress while my mom is in the room,” she pouted as she walked away in a manner that would have been immature and childish if it wasn’t for the fact that she was dressed in a garter belt and stockings only. The way her naked ass danced in each step made things quite a bit different. </p><p>However, one thing was missing, I decided, and picked a pair of white stilettos to complete the ensemble before following her. “I didn’t have the feeling that you were unhappy with it.” </p><p>“That’s not the point,” she said without turning back, but I knew her enough to visualize the frustrated and shy expression she must be holding. </p><p>“Isn’t it?” I said, laughing when she huffed in response. I continued, closing in despite her attitude. Though if she wanted to underline her annoyance, walking to my bed practically naked was not the best way to do so. I was feeling more and more excited, especially when she sat on the bed, her legs crossed, her attempt to seem elegant just making her cuter. </p><p>“What are those for?” she asked as she pointed at the stilettos in my hand. </p><p>“You will look even sexier with those on,” I answered even as I pointed at her. “Then, maybe we can take a few photos.” </p><p>“Photos!” she exclaimed. “I don’t want that!” </p><p>“My gallery disagrees,” I said as waved my phone, and she just blushed. I didn’t wait for her answer, just crouched down and gently grabbed her foot. </p><p>“Stephen, no,” she murmured, but made no attempt to pull her foot back while I gently led it toward the stiletto, caressing her ankle in the process. I was silent while finishing to put on the first one, and she made no protest. When it was time to put on the other one, she readily presented it by putting in on the side, which gave me a momentarily glimpse of her nether lips before her thighs pressed together, cutting my vision. </p><p>I decided to tease her a bit, so after helping her to put on the shoe, rather than connecting its belts, I let my fingers dance over her calf, earning a surprised gasp off her. She growled warningly, but I just chuckled, letting my fingers move up to her knee, dallying there momentarily before climbing up even further, tracing the outside of her thigh. She growled once more, and in response, I leaned forward, letting my breath to fall on her knee, making her shiver in anticipation. Her legs twitched like they wanted to part open, giving me direct access to her core, but she somehow managed to resist it. </p><p>Slowly teasing her was more tempting than aggressively pushing her to the next stage, especially when she deserved it by continuously teasing me with her sexy poses. As a teacher, it was my responsibility to teach her the right way to tease. I moved down and finished tying the belts of her shoe, and stood up. “Done,” I said with a smirk while I enjoyed her mixture of relief and disappointment, though the latter left its place to panic on my next words. “Are you ready to give me a sexy pose?” </p><p>“I - I don’t know,” she stammered, deciding to be shy after everything she had done before. </p><p>“Come on, sweetie, it will help a lot. Knowing how to stand and look is the most important part of being attractive. You have the potential, but we need to shine it.” She opened her mouth hesitantly, but I continued. “Don’t you want to impress me after all the time I spent teaching you,” I said. </p><p>“I do,” she whispered longingly even as she made a motion to stand.  </p><p>“Excellent,” I said even as I put my hand on her shoulder. “You don’t need to stand up sweetie,” I explained. </p><p>“Aren’t we going to take photos,” she said. </p><p>“Yes, we are, but who said you need to leave the bed,” I said, which made her blush even harder, redness of her face contrasting with her beautiful blonde hair. “Come on, don’t tell me that you’re feeling shy after everything.” </p><p>“Of - of course not,” she quickly stammered a reply. To her credit, her concern was justified. Even in her extremely undressed state, taking photos in my own bed was very different from using a more neutral scene setup. In her eagerness to prove herself, however, she was quick to abandon her point, reluctant to disappoint me. </p><p>It was a dangerous quality to have around me. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said as I gave her a gentle smile before passing her a pillow. “Hold this on your chest, but make sure your chest is peeking out a bit,” I explained. “Then, give me your sexiest look.” </p><p>“How about this,” she said as she gave a hesitant smile that made her look like nervous, and not like sexy nervous. She looked like she had a challenging exam. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said, not wanting to discourage her. The first rule of being a photographer was to make the model feel at ease, and it was much more important considering the activities I had planned for her in the aftermath. “Now, let the pillow slide down,” I said even as I repositioned myself over her to catch an amazing cleavage. Just because I was doing that to seduce her didn’t mean that I didn’t want to take more erotic photos. </p><p>“You’re not going to share these, right?” she murmured hesitantly. </p><p>I chose to take her comment in good nature and smiled gently rather than explode angrily at her lack of trust. Considering the things I was doing, I couldn’t claim to be exactly trustworthy. Luckily for her, despite everything, I was a jealous bastard, and those photos were far too private to actually share. “Don’t worry,” I said. “And if it would help, doing so would ruin my professional reputation completely. Nobody would work with a photographer that leaks photos, them being private would matter little.” </p><p>Katie nodded, her fragile smile getting just a touch stronger. “I trust you,” she said. It worked at this particular circumstance, but that didn’t change the fact that it was not a good idea in general. Not that I had any intention of informing her of that particular nugget. Instead, I pressed the shutter, immortalizing her shy look as she slowly moved the pillow down, revealing her shapely breasts to my attention. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said. “Now, lay down and pull on the covers, but I want one of your breasts to be peeking out, like you have forgotten to cover it properly. If you can look a bit surprised, the better.” </p><p>She said nothing, not that she needed to. The white covers, mixed her innocence and with her equally white underwear and her sexy pale skin made her look like a princess. A princess that was seduced by the villain considering her rather revealing her circumstances, of course. I leaned down, watching her from the camera’s peephole, each press of the shutter immortalizing another angle of her innocent sexiness. </p><p>I went through several commands which she followed to the best of her ability. Unlike Nicole or Penny, Katie wasn’t a precious gem as far as modeling was concerned. She was beautiful, no doubt, but she lacked the range of emotion, giving a sense of innocence no matter what she tried. I was aware that expecting to find yet another miracle talent was too unrealistic, but I felt a bit disappointed nonetheless. </p><p>Luckily, Katie was sufficiently amazing in other regards with an innocent enthusiasm to match. </p><p>Since she didn’t turn out to be a miracle modeling talent, I decided to cut the informal audition short and focus on the real aim of her visit. I grabbed the cover even as I ordered her to take several expressions. I pulled it a bit, revealing her other breasts and more of her thighs, but when I gave no sign of stopping, she grabbed the cover in panic. “Katie,” I warned her. </p><p>“Sorry,” she murmured as her fingers loosened, her blush returning strongly. I smiled in response, but didn’t stop pulling away from her covers, revealing her beautiful body in the process. When her body was completely revealed, she put her hand between her legs. This time, I let her do so while taking several more pictures. </p><p>When she finally pulled her hand away, there was a noticeable bulge in my pants. “It doesn’t look comfortable,” she murmured, trying to sound daring and teasing, but once again failing to come across anything but cute. </p><p>“It is, actually, but my hands are full. Why don’t you help me,” I said.</p><p>She blushed, but in the end, she didn’t hesitate much before taking a sitting position. I took a step forward to make it easier, and her hands reached to my pants. She acted quickly, trying to hide the excited tremble in her hand, but she failed to do so. She fumbled with my pants for a bit before managing to untie my belt. Then, proving that she was learning some interesting stuff from me, she pulled my pants down with a torturous slowness before applying the same on my boxers. </p><p>I was furiously taking photos all along, occasionally dipping down the camera to share an encouraging smile. Her fingers wrapped around my shaft, her touch gentle and fleeting, just like my earlier treatment of her legs while I helped her put her shoes. </p><p>“Such a good student,” I said with a smile, frustrating her with my calm smile. Truthfully, she was doing surprisingly well. I would have felt the frustration if I had just arrived from the photoshoot with Penny, but the two loads Nicole had taken worked wonders to remove the edge. </p><p>Seeing my calm expression, Katie had a surprisingly challenging expression on her face. “Let’s see how you’re going to handle this,” she said before leaning forward, her tongue out, giving a trailing lick on my length. </p><p>“Somebody had done some extra-curricular work,” I said as I watched Katie’s tongue dancing along my length with surprising skill. Sometimes, being a nerd had surprising payouts, it seemed. </p><p>Katie just hummed before reaching the bottom, uncaring that I was still taking photos of her amazing lips. She managed to impress me when she took the head into her mouth while maintaining eye contact, her beautiful eyes shimmering with desire. She moved deeper without hesitation until she devoured half of it. </p><p>As much as it was tempting to drop the camera and force her to swallow the rest, watching her attempts to take control was too beautiful to ignore. And with her excellent costume, I was getting some excellent photos for my private album. </p><p>I watched in interest as her hands trailed down her own torso, twisting her nipples as she moaned, vibrations working wonders on my shaft. “You’re doing really well,” I said, and she beamed pridefully. It didn’t surprise me. After all, despite all of her wanton behavior, she was nothing more than an enthusiastic student trying to impress her tutor, and succeeding spectacularly. </p><p>“If this little appetizer impressed you this much, I wonder how you’re going to react to the main course,” she said, her lips curled in imitation of domination, though the hint of hesitance dancing in her eyes showed that her confidence was paper-thin. Still, she was the evidence of nerdy girls deserving their reputation. Stripping in the same room with Nicole, sexy selfies, giving me a nice oral treatment despite being photographed… </p><p>She might not be a good model, but she definitely had all the hallmarks of a good lay. It was rare to find a woman that was willing to focus on self-improvement that much. “How about if you put those beautiful tits in use, sweetie,” I reminded her. </p><p>“Impatient,” she said, trying to sound teasing but only succeeding on shy. Though, her failure to act didn’t matter much when my well-lubricated shaft was squeezed between her breasts, the crown peeking out angrily whenever she reached the apex of her movement. </p><p>“Smile for the camera, honey,” I said even as I lowered it before taking several more photos. </p><p>“Stephen!” she exclaimed, losing her rhythm when suddenly remembered there was a camera recording her. “Put it down.” </p><p>“Come on. Think if of as taking notes. This way, we can examine them together to identify the areas of improvement. You don’t want to do the same mistakes, right?” </p><p>“Am I doing something wrong!?” she exclaimed, her imitation confidence evaporating in an instant. </p><p>“Don’t worry, sweetie,” I said with a chuckle. “You’re doing well, definitely a solid B+. If you continue working hard, you can easily get an A, maybe even an A+.” Put in the terms she might understand, she was quick to calm down. </p><p>“And what exactly I need to do to get that A+,” she whispered throatily as she started moving up and down on my shaft. </p><p>“That’s a secret for now,” I said even as the possible options flew into my mind, taking her puckered hole, or maybe a threesome with her rival Madison, maybe even with some help from Madison’s sexy cousin… That would have been a spectacular final exam. It was a pity that such a possibility was still too far away. </p><p>“Well then,” she said then leaned forward, capturing the crown between her beautiful lips once more while her tits continued their amazing massage to the bottom. </p><p>I wondered what else she had in mind… </p>",

    "content": "<p>I took a step back, my shaft dangling as I examined my landlady, who was doing her best to prevent my cum from ruining her t-shirt as while she continued sitting on the kitchen floor, but it was a battle she was destined to lose with it dripping down her chin. “You need to be more careful, Nicole,” I said with an amused smirk on my face. </p><p>“I … understand,” she murmured as she reached for a napkin, wiping off her chin before bringing the napkin over her body, trying to get rid of the stains. </p><p>“It won’t work, we need to wash it,” I said while taking a step forward. “Raise your arms,” I said.</p><p>She did so, but when I leaned and grabbed the hem of her shirt, she stammered in shock. “What are you doing, Stephen?!” </p><p>“We need to clean it,” I simply said, but made sure to put a stern expression as I looked at her, and she flinched, keeping her arms raised obediently. “You’re not going to walk around with a cum-covered shirt, are you? It would be shameful.” </p><p>I liked the way her face turned crimson, but then I turned my attention back to her body as I dragged her t-shirt up with torturous slowness, revealing her noted and curvy body that she maintained with endless training sessions. When the hem of her shirt reached her breasts, it revealed her underwear, which made me surprised. </p><p>“I didn’t expect you to have these under your soccer mom outfit,” I said even as I dragged my finger underneath her bra. It was one of my gifts, a sexy red piece that had surprisingly good support, compensating by its semi-transparent fabric that failed to hide her rosy areolas and stiff nipples. I wondered whether she was wearing the set, or she had something else underneath. Unfortunately, I still had things to do until I could reveal that. </p><p>Nicole stayed silent when I pulled the loose shirt off her, leaving her transparent bra as her only cover for her upper body. She looked timid, but after our sessions, she learned not to use her arms to cover her body. “You look beautiful,” I said, which made her eyes flutter like a teenager receiving her first compliment. When I presented my hand, she grabbed, allowing me to pull her up gently. </p><p>When I moved even closer, locking her between the kitchen cabinet and my body, she shivered. “I wonder if you have your matching panties,” I whispered into her ear even as I put my hand on her side, a gasp escaped her mouth, but she made no attempt to stop my hand as it traveled down until it reached the elastic of her sweatpants. I stalled there for a second, just to test her reaction, and her inaction satisfied me. </p><p>I gently slid her underwear off, revealing her wide hips, accentuated by bikini-cut panties, again red and semi-transparent. “Good girl,” I whispered into her ear as I traced the edge of her panties, but pulled away a second after it touched the edge of her core. There was no need to hurry. </p><p>I did nothing for a while other than standing in front of her, listening to her breathing, which was getting more and more frantic as seconds passed. I said nothing, just tracing her curves from her side, avoiding more exciting locations. Considering she would be seen if someone walked in the living room, her composure was impressive. She managed not to say anything for a full minute. “Stephen, please,” she murmured. </p><p>“Please, what, sweetie?” I said even as let my hands move to her stomach, occasionally dipping low enough to trace the lines of her underwear. </p><p>She looked distressed for a moment before whispering back. “Let’s move to my bedroom. I’m scared to be caught here,” she murmured, trembling as she said so. Combined with the blowjob while trying to stay hidden from Katie, I had pushed her quite a bit out of her comfort zone, and unfortunately, it seemed that having sex in the middle of the kitchen was still not something she could handle. </p><p>“As you wish, baby,” I said, deciding to cut her some slack because she actually followed my suggestion and started wearing sexier underwear. I could have pushed her more, but it would be counterproductive. In this way, she would feel appreciated rather than resentful. There were limits, of course, such as when she reached for her clothes, I stepped on them and sent a pointed glare at her. </p><p>She understood the message, because she said nothing as I picked up her clothes. Then, I wrapped my arm around her waist, too low to be appropriate even if she had been actually wearing clothes, not to mention when she was in just her underwear. “Let’s go, sweetie,” I said even as we started walking slowly. </p><p>“So, any plans for tomorrow?” I asked lazily even as my hand dipped lower, sliding insider her panties. She stalled for a moment, somehow still shocked by my daring, but my fingers continued to their destination, testing her wetness. </p><p>At this point, Nicole was familiar enough with my attitude to realize stopping would only exacerbate the situation, so she started walking once more. Her answer, however, waited until my index finger slipped inside her wet entrance. “I have nothing to do,” she gasped, somehow managing not to moan loudly, though the way she was biting her lips told me that it hadn’t been easy. </p><p>“You do now,” I said even as I added a second finger to my teasing. “We’re going for dinner tomorrow night.” She gasped, which was likely about my fingers rather than the impromptu pseudo-date, but the latter part might have affected her mood a bit as well. After all, our relationship was weird without including a semblance of dating to it. </p><p>Her legs trembled for a moment, then started walking at a faster pace. It was a mistake I was very willing to punish. </p><p>The moment she passed me, I unzipped my pants and revealed my shaft, then took a fast step forward. A flick of fingers to push her panties aside, and I was plunged inside her. This time, there was no holding back her moans. She once again stopped, this time inevitably as her legs trembled badly, threatening to drop her. I grabbed her from her waist, which gave me the perfect leverage to slam inside her, easily sliding into her wetness. </p><p>“Not here,” she murmured and tried to move forward, but I tightened my grip around her hips, preventing her from moving fast. I wanted to enjoy the moment. </p><p>“What’s the hurry, Nicole,” I said even as I slammed into her, one of my hands returning to explore her body after she stopped trying to move faster. </p><p>“Stephen, please,” she moaned as she took the first step to the stairs, which saved me from trying to bend my knees to angle myself. Being tall was fun, but it had its disadvantages. </p><p>“Come on, sweetie, it’s not time we’re climbing the stairs the fun way, is it?” I said, underlining it with a spank on her bottom. </p><p>“But-” she started saying as she tried to twist her upper body to catch my eyes, but I pressed my hand to her lips. </p><p>“You better keep it low, Nicole,” I warned. “You don’t want to alert Katie, do you?” Panic bloomed on her face as she nodded, starting to climb once more. After a couple of steps, I reached to the back of her bra and unhooked it with a flick. She didn’t react when I pulled it off. Understandable, considering if we were caught at that moment, the lack of a bra wasn’t going to make a big difference. </p><p>So, I decided to spice things up more. I left the bra hanging on the railing, and made sure that Nicole noticed it. When she looked at me pitifully, I decided to take mercy on her. “Don’t worry, if the girls notice, you can say that it belongs to one of my slutty models.” I chuckled. “Not like it’s incorrect.” </p><p>Soon, we were in the middle of the stairs, and I was slamming inside her again and again, when the phone buzzed. I pulled it to check, only to see it was Katie. I checked the message, only to see her wearing one of the outfits I hadn’t bothered to pick up from the last shot. She had picked a black underwear set, a size bigger for her, but that, along with her cute makeup, worked for her, giving her an innocent allure. I licked my lips in desire. </p><p>‘Try a few more, I’ll be there as long as I can find an excuse to slip away from Nicole,’ I said, naturally not cluing her to the fact that I was ramming her stepmother in the middle of the stairs. </p><p>“What are you doing with the phone,” Nicole asked. It surprised me, because, for the first time, I heard a jealous tinge in her voice.</p><p>I was amused, but still, it wouldn’t be right to leave her without a punishment. “I was setting up the camera settings for a few private photos,” I said even as I pulled out of her. “Sit on the stairs, your legs together and your knees on your chest.” </p><p>Regret appeared on her face instantly, though it wasn’t thick enough to hide her arousal. After all, despite her intellectual reluctance, being photographed was working wonders for her libido, something I had known since our first session. “But what if the girls come on,” she stammered, her concerns overwhelming her desire for a moment. </p><p>“Don’t worry, we can always say you’re helping me practice,” I said as I raised my phone, taking a photo before she took a pose, the exploding flash triggering her reflexes, and she quickly took the photo. “Excellent, now, look surprised, like you were expecting to be alone in the home, walking around half-naked, but you get caught by a surprise guest.” She followed the direction, but I could see her hands trembling, whether from excitement or fear, I didn’t know. </p><p>“You’re feeling mischievous and want to frustrate your surprise guest. I want you to be playfully surprised, but part your legs a bit, just enough to give a glimpse of cleavage.” Nicole followed my order, widening her legs enough to reveal the beautiful valley between her breasts, her nipples still hidden behind her knees. “Do you feel aroused flashing to your visitor?” I asked. She nodded. “Use your words, sweetie,” I said. </p><p>“Yes,” she whispered. </p><p>“Then, why don’t you tease him a bit more,” I said even as I used my phone to continue taking more photos. </p><p>She hesitated for a second, but then her legs parted more, enough to give a hint of areola, as well as a shy smile. “How is this?” she murmured. </p><p>“As usual, excellent,” I said, crazily taking photos, glad that I had no obligation to share them with others. Unlike a usual fashion photoshoot, there was nothing sterile about her current poses, oozing a thick eroticism. I was glad that my shaft was still outside, as otherwise, my pants would have felt very uncomfortable. “Now, he’s walking closer and closer. You can see he’s hungry, and you like that hunger. What are you going to do?” </p><p>She smiled enticingly, far sexier than I had ever seen adorn before. Roleplaying in front of a camera was really working for her. Her legs widened further, giving me a glimpse of her beautiful nipples. But before I could take a photo, I received another message from Katie, this time wearing a little black dress that covered very little. The only reason I wasn’t able to see her ass was that she was taking a high-angle selfie. Though, the resulting cleavage was enough compensation. </p><p>I quickly wrote a response before turning my attention back to Nicole, whose fingers were hooked around her panties, pushing it slightly to reveal a hint of her core. It didn’t matter much, however, as her entrance was wet enough to turn it completely transparent. “He’s walking closer and closer, and you don’t know how far he’s gonna go,” I added, and Nicole’s fingers disappeared in her panties, her fingers digging into her entrance. </p><p>“Yesss!” she moaned, her legs widening perfectly, giving me an amazing view even with her hand blocking the view. Her other hand landed on her breasts, mauling mercilessly as she tried to push herself to the climax, her every move surprising me more. It was interesting to see such a shy woman to turn into a wanton slut just because of a photoshoot that interrupted a surprise lovemaking session. </p><p>“He comes closer and closer,” I whispered throatily as I closed in the distance, watching as her fingers quickened. “What do you want him to do?” </p><p>“Whatever he wants,” Nicole gasped as her fingers turned furious, leaving red marks on her own breasts, her face a portrait of desire. I found myself focusing on her face, trying to immortalize the passion on her face, each a unique touch. Soon, the temptation became too much, and I put my hand on her body, the other still holding the phone. </p><p>My fingers dug into the supple flesh of her breasts, enjoying the way she shivered under my touch. But as much as I liked her breasts, I was getting too impatient. My hand moved lower, teasing her curves until it reached the side of her panties, and gave a hard tug, its semi-transparent fragile fabric not giving any resistance. </p><p>Her mouth opened in a moan, and I used the opportunity to stuff her panties into her mouth, silencing her. “You suddenly remember that you’re in the middle of your house, where anyone could see,” I said with a dark pleasure, watching her arousal being invaded by panic as she realized that she had somehow managed to forget that important detail in her excitement. </p><p>“You want to move away, but your legs are trembling, so you can only crawl,” I explained. Nicole followed my direction, and started climbing on the stairs on all fours, her naked bottom free for my attention, forcing me a horrible dilemma. Should I record such an amazing view, spank her adorable bottom, or finally cut free. </p><p>Then, it occurred to me that it wasn’t a dilemma. I switched the phone to video recording before taking a large step forward, and slid inside her welcoming core, sopping wet and already loosened by her own fingers. A moan escaped her mouth despite her panties still stuffed there, her walls getting tighter. I slammed deep, and her arms started trembling, struggling to keep her in place. </p><p>“Climb,” I ordered as I spanked her bottom hard, followed by an inevitable moan. Still, despite her trembling arms, she managed to move forward a step, with me still behind her, impaling her again and again, mercilessly, trying to push for an explosion of my own. I could see Nicole was already close. </p><p>“You’re being taken like a wanton slut in the stairs of your own home as a common whore once again, Nicole,” I said as I spanked her once more, making her take another step. “How does it feel?” </p><p>Her mouth still stuffed, she only managed an indecipherable muffle, but the way she tightened even more worked sufficiently as an answer. We continued our erotic climb toward orgasm on the stairs, each step marked with several spanks, making her bottom glow once more. “You enjoy it, don’t you, slut?” I said. “Such a bad role model. I wonder what the girls that look up to you as a role model would have said if they see your true face.” </p><p>She tried to cry, once again muffled, but it finally pushed her over the cliff to her orgasm. She collapsed, moaning and crying, but I continued to slam inside her repeatedly even as I continued to record it. </p><p>When she turned her head, I reached and pulled her panties out of her mouth, and a loud moan escaped her mouth. She pressed her hand panickedly, trying to contain her voice, but her moans mixed with the sound of flesh hitting flesh. “Do you like it, Nicole? Do you like to be fucked mercilessly in your own home, where anyone could see your sluttiness.” </p><p>She didn’t answer at first, so I spanked her, forcing a confession out of her. “Yes,” she moaned ashamedly, but that wasn’t enough to erase arousal from her face. That, combined with her tightness, managed to push me over my cliff, and I exploded, filling her insides with my seed. “Yessss!” she repeated, louder, making me glad that the basement had decent sound isolation. </p><p>It would have been hard to explain to Katie why I was fucking her stepmother in the middle of the stairs while she was in my room, waiting for my attention. </p><p>I pulled out, still recording the amazing amateur porn piece we had created. Nicole tried to stand up, but she lacked the strength to actually succeed. As tempting was to leave her there, used and spent, I was actually living here, and there was no need to ruin things when it was getting so fun. So I helped Nicole to stand up, then presented my arm to help her walk in a pose that might have been romantic if she wasn’t completely naked with a thin line of cum trailing down her leg. </p><p>Nicole was too exhausted to say anything as I helped her to walk to her bedroom, but even then, when I helped her to lay on her bed, she opened her legs readily, desiring for another session. Just then, my phone buzzed once more, revealing Katie, this time wearing only a pair of panties, using her arm as a bra. </p><p>“Get rest, sweetie. That was enough,” I said to Nicole even as I gently kissed her forehead, and she smiled shyly. </p><p>I doubted she would have reacted just as nicely if she knew my destination. </p>",

    "content": "<p>The redhead opened her mouth, but failed to say anything. Understandable considering the challenge she had just went through. I decided to use the time to get a better view of her body, and let my gaze drift over her body. </p><p>The first thing I noticed was her flaming red hair, long enough to reach the middle of her back, tied back in a loose ponytail, making me imagine how it would look once it was free, flowing with the wind. Her ponytail had the advantage of leaving her face free of obstruction, revealing a surprisingly lovely face that wouldn’t be amiss belonging to a scion of a noble family, crowned by a pair of bright emerald eyes, and pouty red lips. She was likely in her early twenties. </p><p>Liking what I saw, and seeing that she was still struggling to say anything, I let my gaze drift even lower, examining the curvy body that showed itself despite the looseness of her rough linen shirt, and a few tears that she doubtlessly acquired during her long escape revealed a delicious hint of pale skin underneath. I wondered how it would feel to sink my fingers into her generous bosom. </p><p>Moving downward, I could see the hints of a thin waist, though with her loose blouse it was more of a guess than an observation, followed by another widening, this time her hips, straining the capability of her skirt to keep them contained. </p><p>Then I turned my attention to her tattoos that covered her arms, not covered by her short-sleeved blouse, making an interesting pattern on her otherwise pale skin. Their design was interesting, but not as much as the magic flowing through them. It was an interesting choice, grafting her magical focus into her body, unafraid of the consequences. Not only did it limit her magical flexibility quite a bit, but also, it wasn’t like she could easily discard her skin if she was wounded. Though, on the positive side, it was stronger than many focuses I had used, impressive considering she was living in the middle of the wilderness. </p><p>I wanted to free her from her clothes, partially because of my magical curiosity to see whether her tattoos were drifting inside, partially because I was getting a boner as I examined her beautiful body. </p><p>Considering I was completely naked, there was no hiding my boner. She blushed deeply as she noticed it and sent a fearful gaze towards me. Understandable from her perspective, though lucky for her, I was not a brute. I decided to distract her. “Let’s start with a simpler question. What’s your name?” I asked in a calm tone even as I gestured to her to follow me while I started walking away. </p><p>“Astrid,” she said with a whisper, looking nominally calmer now that I didn’t show an immediate bad intent, but a lot of her wariness stayed in her eyes. She took a few more steps before realizing we were about to step out of the opening. “Are you going to leave the bear like this?” she asked. </p><p>“Unfortunately, yes,” I said, and when she looked at me questioningly, I continued. “I put a bit of effort into hunting that, but if I skin it, those blockheads will know someone is still alive.” </p><p>“Why do you need to avoid them?” she asked quickly, as she looked at my eyes, trying to seem calm, but unable to hide her sudden excitement. “You’re very strong and brave. Or do you think you can’t handle them if they are in a bigger group?” </p><p>I couldn’t help but feel amused at her questions, especially the unsubtle way she tried to goad me into action. It might work against the tribal warriors, as from what I had seen, those young guys weren’t exactly the sharpest knife in a drawer, but after the nobles’ subtle ploys, it was terribly transparent. “Maybe, but I have a lot of things to do, and I don’t need the annoyance of fighting back against them as well,” I added. </p><p>“But, what if-” she started, this time more heated, determined to use me to solve their enmity, but I silenced her with a wave of my hand.</p><p>“Enough,” I called, nominally shorter. “It’s not a bargain, and I don’t have to explain it to you. But I’m curious, tell me about yourself?” </p><p>“I’m the priestess of the great tribe of Welker,” she said, unable to help herself from pushing out her chest pridefully, which had the nice effect of straining her blouse’s capability to keep her breasts hidden. The effect was nice, and the pride was understandable. I didn’t know a lot about the tribal culture of Germania, but priestess was clearly a position of great responsibility and capability, and it greatly favored the elder considering its magical leanings. The fact that she was able to get the position in her youth spoke a lot about her capabilities, enough to make me consider whether to keep her around for more than her sexy bosom. </p><p>Then, I remembered the guys calling the other person  the leader of the Welker tribe as well. “Didn’t those guys also present themselves as part of the same tribe?” I asked. </p><p>“They are traitors,” she spat angrily. I looked at her questioningly, and she continued. “Our old leader disappeared, and in his absence, his wife, the great Helena temporarily took the role of the leader as the tradition dictates,” she explained. </p><p>“I’m guessing those guys didn’t appreciate it,” I said even as I led her deeper into the forest, looking around carefully to find a hint of prey. We still need some leather to fashion clothing, I was about to say, when I realized Astrid’s clothes had quite a bit of excess fabric. Fashioning some clothing from them would have been easier. </p><p>“The one they called the leader is the nephew of our leader,” she explained, unaware of the plots aimed at her clothing. “His father was supposed to rule the tribe, but died several years ago in a duel when he challenged the current leader.”</p><p>“Why?” I said, as more of an idle curiosity than actual intention to help. </p><p>“He wanted the hand of Lady Helena,” she explained, adding another nugget of detail to their leadership crisis. “So, Grundi decided to take his uncles’ disappearance as an opportunity, and petitioned the tribe to be the new leader.” </p><p>“How long has  the leader been absent?” I asked, curious. </p><p>“It has been two month, but Grundi started speaking about his right to be leader just a week into his absence,” the priestess murmured furiously. I understood the reason for her anger. If he was that quick to act, it was reasonable to assume that he knew that the disappearance was permanent. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have taken the risk. </p><p>“I’m guessing that the tribe didn’t take kindly to that fact,” I said. </p><p>“No,” she said sharply, but then continued with a calmer tone. “Not at first, at least,” she said. “But when some of the strongest supporters of Lady Helena suddenly disappeared, people started to think differently.” From there, she continued to give a detailed breakdown of their struggle for dominance, though it was mostly their faction losing more and more support, while I solidified my idea that there was an external force supporting Grundi’s faction. That was the simplest explanation for their increasing strength during the struggle. Still, assuming Astrid was accurate, I was impressed with Helena. It wasn’t easy to maintain her leadership under challenge in a tribal society.  </p><p>“Interesting,” I murmured. That, together with the totem Grundi had used to create the wall of flame suggested that he had a secret support. “What made them act suddenly?”</p><p>“Lady Helena disappeared as well,” she said, and I sent a questioning gaze. “She’s not dead,” she said confidently, without a shred of doubt. I felt curious. Either her faith in Helena was that impressive, or she knew something she wasn’t telling me. I was inclined to believe the latter. “After she disappeared, the rest was quick to declare Grundi as the new leader.” </p><p>“Let me guess. You stayed there, keeping your head down, waiting for an opportunity to strike, but they decided to target you for an unrelated reason,” I said, feeling confident at my guess. </p><p>She nodded. “Grundi decided that I was too young to be priestess, and decided to have me married to Ettru,” she said, and when I looked at her questioningly, she continued. “The weasel that escaped,” she clarified. </p><p>“Ah, I understand why you chose to run away,” I said. Plotting was good and all, but not if it required a big personal sacrifice. I only interacted with the guy for a few moments, but he managed to annoy me throughly. Also, I had a feeling that I did a good deed by avoiding killing him, because he was definitely going to create more problems for Grundi, enough to prevent him from digging deep into my supposed death. </p><p>As we spoke, we were getting closer to the cave. “I understand. Now, let’s move on the next topic, namely, my reward for saving you.” </p><p>That made her take a step back, her arms rising protectively. Her concern was understandable. “What do you have in mind?” she said, managing to keep her voice even. </p><p>“Nothing too onerous,” I said. “I have a friend here as well, and we’re stranded here after an accident with absolutely nothing.” </p><p>“That much is obvious,” she said, pointing at my naked state, and my only weapon stolen from my attackers. </p><p>“Right,” I said. “Normally, I wouldn’t mind hunting in an unfamiliar forest for a few days, as it would be fun.” I added, and she nodded, knowing it was an empty brag after seeing me taking down a thunder bear easily. “Unfortunately, we’re being followed, so a guide with a good knowledge of the terrain would be useful.” </p><p>I could see her not entirely happy about being conscripted as a guide, but she was also smart enough to realize that it was the best option at the moment. “It would be my honor,” she murmured. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said even as we traversed the small path leading to the cave. “And we’re here. Try to keep silent, my companion is still exhausted.” </p><p>“It’s a good location to rest,” she said, not knowing what else to say. </p><p>I gestured for her to take a seat on a nearby stone while I walked into the cave, confident that she would wait for me. A nice view awaited me inside. Lillian was laying on the bed of grass I had created for her, her naked body hinting at all kinds of deliciousness, begging me to take a dip. Unfortunately, we had a guest. I reached out and caressed her shoulder. “Good morning, princess,” I whispered. </p><p>“Ten more minutes,” she murmured adorably in response, not bothering to open her eyes. Her hand reached down, looking for a nonexistent cover. Only when she failed repeatedly, her eyes popped open as she remembered the situation she was in. </p><p>“Good morning, beautiful,” I whispered as I caressed her hair, but then pulled away, something that made her relieved and disappointed at the same time. I wanted to tease her a bit, but we had delayed enough. The raiders probably already landed, so we needed to start moving. “Be ready, we have a guest,” I said as I stood up, which, once again, treated her with a full-frontal view of my naked body. She blushed. </p><p>“What do you mean by a guest?” she said, curious but not alarmed, though she reflexively covered her body at the mention of a stranger. </p><p>“I was hunting when I came across another damsel in distress, accosted by several annoying assholes, so I intervened,” I briefly explained, not bothering to go in detail. </p><p>“So, it’s a woman,” she said, her voice wobbly, like she was stuck between feeling relieved or annoyed. Relieved because in her current lack of dress a random male companion wasn’t something she needed, and I hoped her annoyance was from a feeling of jealousy. </p><p>“Why, is it a problem?” I asked with a smirk. </p><p>“Of course not,” she answered instantly as she turned her head, but her blush proved truer. I chuckled. </p><p>“Do you know how to sew?” I asked after several seconds while I let her enjoy her blush. </p><p>“I do,” she answered, looking confused for a moment about what she considered as a surprised tangent before reason seeped into her sleepy mind. “You found fabric,” she gasped in excitement. </p><p>In a manner of speaking it was true, so I just nodded. “Yes, hopefully enough to cover the essentials for both of us,” I explained before hitting her with a flirty smile. “Don’t get me wrong, I quite enjoy our dress code, but a forest is not the best place to walk around like this.” </p><p>“You scoundrel,” she gasped as she slapped my arm, which I noted to be pretty playful. She had come a long way in the last few days. Mortal danger had a way of making people learn what was truly important. </p><p>I chuckled. “You can come and meet our guest if you won’t feel too self-conscious,” I asked with a faux-concern, which earned another slap and a chuckle from her. She followed me outside, though she stayed a step behind, using my body as a partial cover. </p><p>The expression of superiority that appeared on both of their faces the moment they saw each other, complete with a soft harumph sound, was genuinely amusing, but despite everything that happened to me I still had a smidgen of survival instinct, so I refrained from openly laughing. </p><p>“So, girls, let me introduce you to each other,” I said, my tone doing little to break the tension. “Astrid, this is Lillian, my travel companion for the foreseeable future,” I said, and Astrid nodded coldly, her head barely moving. Lillian was smart enough to get Astrid’s supposed superiority, but she chose to act obvious despite her tightening jaw. </p><p>Astrid must have disliked the lack of reaction. “Is this what they call whores in the cities,” Astrid stage-whispered. </p><p>I could have warned Astrid to rein herself in, but Lillian was a big girl, and strong enough to fight this battle. Astrid was no dragon serpent, after all. “And Lillian, this is Astrid, our guide for the next few days.” </p><p>“It’s a pleasure,” Lillian said with a bright, friendly smile, and Astrid looked shocked, and even a bit ashamed. I barely held back from giggling, because I had seen that smile before, usually against another noble girl that managed to annoy her in the school, right before that girl suffered a humiliating accident. Her beauty might have put Lillian to the top of the school hierarchy, but it was her hidden viciousness that kept her there. </p><p>I wondered what kind of innovative humiliation awaited Astrid. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said. “I need to go hunting, but I want you two to stay here and make a workable dress for Lillian. We have enough people hunting us without people seeing her deliciousness,” I said, happy to see a soft blush on Lillian’s face at my compliment. </p><p>“Okay, but where’s the fabric you promised,” Lillian said. I just pointed at Astrid. </p><p>Lillian nodded vindictively, but Astrid was slower on the uptake. “I don’t have any extra fabric with me,” she said, but when I gazed at her with a smirk, she realized as well. “No, not my clothes,” she said. “Can’t we do something from leather,” she said. </p><p>“Not unless you can do that magically,” I said. </p><p>“Of course not,” she said immediately. “Who would be so wasteful as to create a spell for that!” </p><p>Lillian and I shared an amused glare. “Things are a bit different back in the Republic, even in a remote province,” I explained. “Unfortunately, Lillian’s experience is limited with fabric, and my magic is a bit wonky right now so I won’t be able to cast anything delicate for a few days,” I explained. The initial idea was to process the leather through mundane methods, but it would have cost us a few days. Since Astrid had such a long skirt and a loose shirt, using the excess to fashion some temporary clothing was much easier. </p><p>“But-” Astrid said, trying to argue, but I let loose my magic, letting the pressure wash over her. She blanched. It was the simplest trick any magic user could do, and it was directly dependent on the relative power between the user and the target. Even Lillian blanched a bit despite her familiarity and not being the target, but also became aroused a bit. Power was an interesting thing, scary, but also worked as an effective aphrodisiac. </p><p>“Understood,” Astrid murmured, scared by my display. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said, satisfied. I hadn’t used my power to cut the discussion short, but to remind Astrid about my power. I trusted Lillian to handle herself, but it would be best to keep Astrid aware of the consequences of annoying me. “Then, I’ll see you in a couple of hours,” I said before leaving them alone. </p><p>My intention was to hunt something for food, which, luckily, didn’t take long, meaning I had some time to kill. I decided to continue assimilating my magic, not wanting it to get out of control. Unfortunately, it was too flashy to do back in the camp. So, I searched for a while to find another concealed spot about a mile away from the camp, and crouched down. </p><p>My hands sparked in thunder as I took a deep breath, trying to ignore the pain. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I felt reluctant as I walked away from the cave, a part of me wanting to lay next to the exhausted beauty that had worked very hard to swallow my shaft for a while. Pity that my transformed instincts made it an impossibility. Instead, I walked away, carefully examining my surroundings. I didn’t feel safe walking alone and naked, even when I had my magic to rely on. </p><p>So, when I saw a nice looking branch, I decided to create a primitive spear for myself, just so that I didn’t need to rely on magic against everything. I raised my hand after grabbing a handful of dirt and concentrated, trying to shape my magic into a simple earth blade, something I had been able to do in the blink of an eye even before I joined the Halls of Saturn. However, even after concentrating for ten seconds, I almost failed while controlling the spell, not by fizzling, but by the energy escaping in a great hurry and leaving a big mark on the tree. </p><p>I frowned as I grabbed the branch, which laid on the ground, separated from the tree, which I doubted would survive with the terrible wound I had created, showing my lack of control. Weird that it was easier for me to destroy a whole tree than to cut a branch. </p><p>With my obvious need for control, I had to ruin four innocent branches before I finally succeeded in crafting something that might be classified as a spear, but only if the observer was blind. Still, it was better than walking around empty-handed, so I grabbed it and continued walking, this time my eyes on the ground, looking for fresh signs of an animal. </p><p>Ten minutes later, I came across the distinctive tracks of a bear, and decided to follow them. Bear meat might not be the most delicious thing to eat, but it would fill us. More importantly, it was large enough to create a working set of clothes for both of us. As much as I enjoyed a naked Lillian, she needed to be dressed before we could start distancing ourselves from the pirates, because, even if I hadn’t been feeling possessive after our little play back in the cave, having her walk around naked was inviting more trouble than I could handle; especially in the desolate plains famous for their violent local tribes that resisted subjugation attempts from the Republic for centuries. Dealing with those savages would be difficult enough without tempting them with Lillian’s delicious body explicitly. </p><p>It took several minutes for me to arrive at the cave of my target, which was at the end of a cliff that was followed by a deep river. It wasn’t a normal bear, I realized when an earth-shaking roar left the cave, carrying hints of magic. It was an interesting roar, one that conveyed a sense of utter superiority, ordering me to disappear. It was a nice idea, I decided. My prey was clearly not a weakling, and rather than exhausting myself, I could find an easier one. </p><p>However, I found myself shouting back, those fucking new instincts taking control before I could realize and control them. </p><p>While I was trying to understand the reason, another roar rang, this time much louder, much more aggressive. My grip around my spear tightened even as I raised my other hand, ready to cast a fire spell, the easiest elemental for me to cast after my transformation. From the roar, I felt that escaping was not an option. </p><p>Then, a huge bear dashed out of the cave, its fur crackling in lightning, also dashing my hopes tf avoiding an unnecessary confrontation. A thunder bear, an elemental magical predator that made a lot of forests forbidden for humans, easily destroying scores of humans as long as their magical capabilities didn’t reach the level of a mage. </p><p>It wasn’t a threat to me of course. With my capabilities nearing the level of a sorcerer, worst came to worst, I could have blasted it with the same spell I had used to destroy the longboat. The problem, it was pretty noticeable, so relying on it might result in my position being revealed. Not an ideal solution. I could have tricked him to the edge of the cliff to throw it off, but thunder bears were smart enough to catch such simple tactics, and even if I succeed, I would have to forfeit its skin, screwing up my point in the first place. </p><p>So, when the thunder bear charged toward me, instead of blasting it with my full strength, I swung my primitive spear toward its face, swiping toward its eye. A magnificent roar escaped its mouth as the tip of my spear connected with its target, one that conveyed impotence despite all the anger and power. </p><p>After all, its eye was gone. </p><p>It swiped its dangerously huge paw toward me, much faster than I would have thought it to be capable of. I threw myself to the side, but the stinging sensation on my shoulder showed it wasn’t unscathed, not that it bothered me much. </p><p>I couldn’t help but laugh, thinking how things would have been different if it wasn’t for the enhanced physical capabilities given to me by my transformation, saving me from a grizzly death. My magic might be limited and impaired, but I was faster and stronger than ever before physically. </p><p>Maybe I should test my limits, I suddenly decided as I took a step back, waving my spear toward the bear, making it flinch. However, the thunder bear was smart enough to realize that it was a feint, and prideful enough to take it personally. It dashed toward me with another roar. This time, I threw myself to the side without bothering to attack it, showing a grace that would make a gladiator jealous. At least, any gladiator that I had seen in Londinium. The real gladiators, the ones that fought in the Colosseum in Rome for the pleasure of citizens and senators were supposed to be much more capable. </p><p>Maybe someday, I could visit to compare.  </p><p>A shift in the battle forced me to abort my holiday planning in favor of avoiding an injury. Realizing that its strategy was not working as it was supposed to, the bear decided to roar once more, but this time tapping into its bloodline. A bright light appeared in its mouth, and a bolt of lightning dashed toward me. I managed to create a shield at the last second, deflecting it upward in a beautiful light show that cut through the soft light of dusk. </p><p>So much for staying unnoticed. </p><p>Since the bear decided to rely on magic despite its physical advantage, I saw no problem trying to do the same. I raised my hand and sent a bludgeoning arcane ball toward it. Not the best attack spell, a fireball would have been much more efficient, but also it would have ruined its fur. I still needed to craft clothing from it, after all. And I still didn’t have sufficient control to cast a decent piercing spell that wouldn’t ruin the fur while killing it. </p><p>It attacked, I dodged. It sent a lightning bolt, I shielded before countering with another bludgeoning attack. It got slower and slower, and for a moment, I thought that it would be the end. </p><p>Of course, lady fate decided to apply the new trend of my life, and things got complicated once again. I heard shouts and running people. I would have disengaged from the bear, but it intensified its attacks, probably thinking that they were my reinforcements. Pulling back without ruining the fur was impossible. </p><p>Then, someone dashed into the opening recklessly. I was about to blast the intruder, but kept myself from casting at the last minute when I managed to get a good glance at the intruder. It was a buxom redhead, dressed in loose furs that somehow failed to hide her impressive curves. Her face was, though wild and sharp, still beautiful, and I wasn’t wasteful enough to destroy such a beauty before making sure she was actually an enemy. </p><p>Still, just because she was a sexy woman didn’t mean I stopped paying attention. She didn’t carry any obvious weapon other than a dagger, which was more for utility than combat, but I could feel a subtle sense of magic from her tattoos. She seemed like some kind of spellcaster, but what kind, I wasn’t sure. Unlike the republic, the tribals had an impressive number of magical traditions with differing efficiency. </p><p>I didn’t want to waste the gathered magic, so I gathered it in my palm and sent it toward the bear, much stronger than the other orbs I had sent at it. It managed to understand the danger it was in and tried to dodge, but it was too exhausted, so it failed, and one of its legs was broken badly as a result. </p><p>I looked at the redhead from the corner of my eye, only to find her frozen with a shocked expression on her face. Considering she watched a naked mage fighting against a thunder bear, I wasn’t inclined to blame her. I chuckled as I attacked the bear again and again, beating it to death as soon as possible. I could still hear people coming forward, and I didn’t want to risk fighting on two fronts. A pseudo-sorcerer I might be, but a two-pronged assault was dangerous, especially when one of the prongs was a famous magical predator that could threaten small towns. </p><p>“How!” the woman exclaimed in shock, her eyes stuck on the cooling carcass of the thunder bear. </p><p>“Easy,” I answered as I turned to her, twirling my spear lazily, not at all ashamed of my naked state. Before she could reply, five men burst into the opening as well, two of them carrying axes, others armed with steel-tipped spears. “Your friends?” I asked her, even though, from her sudden panic, I could see that it wasn’t the case. </p><p>“Who are you, you fucker?” called one of the interlopers who was a couple of inches taller than the others, with a greataxe in his hands. He sounded confident, but I noticed his gaze flickering back just to make sure his friends were still back there, supporting him. </p><p>“Such a rude boy,” I said as I took a step forward, a lazy smile on my face as I looked at the redhead. “Is he someone important?” </p><p>“As I said before, he’s the one trying to take leadership, sir,” said the girl, earning a shocked glare from the men. I wasn’t any less surprised, but after years of playing a role, I was much quicker to adapt. I got the gist of the situation. They were clearly from the same tribe, going through an internal dispute. What impressed me was that redhead was either perceptive enough to realize that I was partial to her, or she was brave enough to force me into their conflict without a good handle of my personality.</p><p>Either way, it was the second point in her favor, her sexy body being the first. I decided to play along. “So, you’re that insolent boy that dares to threaten those under my protection,” I said as I took another step forward, and I was highly amused to see that they took a step back. I was still naked, and I didn’t bother to release the pressure of my magic, but the carcass of a thunder bear laying just a few feet away was much more intimidating than any kind of clothes. </p><p>“I didn’t know,” the leader stammered before one of his supporters poked his back and shared a warning gaze. “I mean, who are you to dare intervene with our glorious Welker tribe. Are you seeking your death?” he bellowed, hoping that volume was a good substitute for confidence. Unfortunately for him, it wasn’t, so I took another step and lazily raised my spear. </p><p>From their expressions, I guessed that his friends had realized the same thing. The one that poked him earlier leaned to his ear and whispered, unaware that I could hear him easily. “He’s just one man, why are we afraid of him?” he asked. </p><p>“Don’t you see that hulking monster next to him,” the leader whispered back. “And who the fuck walks around naked in the middle of the forest. He is clearly not normal.” </p><p>I thought that would be the end of it, but then the other one decided to push forward. “What kind of leader are you, scared just because of a crazy man. Maybe matron is right, not making you the chieftain.” </p><p>That did the trick, because I saw the anger flashing on the leader’s face, unable to handle his courage being attacked. “On my mark, attack together,” he said even as he looked at the guy that was egging him on to attack, his anger building higher by the second. Maybe things were a bit more complicated than I first presumed. “We can take him down easily if we surprise him,” he added as he looked at the others and saw the rest not sharing his confidence, and attempting to convince the others. </p><p>“But-” tried to say one of the others before the sly looking one spoke once more, cutting him off. </p><p>“Go back to the village and beg the matron for mercy if you can’t handle following our glorious leader,” he said even as he patted the largest man on the shoulder. While they discussed, I shared a look with the sexy redhead, only to catch her examining my naked body while trying to be discrete. I smiled teasingly, and she blushed, forgetting her followers for a second. </p><p>Meanwhile, the gang finished their argument, and the leader ordered. “Charge, let’s get them before the bitch can cast a spell.” whispered.  </p><p>The rest of the team nodded before letting out war cries and charging forward. Three of them, including the leader, charged toward me while the other two, including the sly one that pushed the leader for a confrontation moved toward the redhead. The redhead pulled a bone from her satchel hurriedly and shook it, mana gathering around her rapidly. I was curious about what she was casting, but I had more important things to focus on than her spell selection. </p><p>Like the charging figure of the leader, brandishing his axe with two smaller figures following him, their spears high. I smirked, greeting the challenge. Unlike the thunder bear, three warriors dashing toward me with their superior weapons was the perfect opportunity to assess my increased physical capabilities. </p><p>Therefore, I didn’t blast the leader away with a bolt of flame when his axe started cutting through the air with the intention of arriving to my head, but took a sidestep instead. It was a simple looking but deceptively complex move, so I easily avoided the swing of the axe, and came face to face with one of his followers, who looked surprised at my sudden assault. He was probably expecting me to pull back. </p><p>It was the last surprise he would ever have, because I buried my impromptu spear into his throat, and he collapsed on the ground. I heard the distinctive sound of an axe cutting into the air, and ducked. The axe flew inches above my head. I kicked the leader in the knee, and he stumbled, giving me the time to take the spear back from my victim. </p><p>I was planning to play around a bit more, but then I realized the redhead was having trouble defending herself despite the swirling mass of dark energy around her, barely preventing the combined assault of the two warriors. I decided to finish my fight quickly, rolling forward before stopping in front of the other follower, making sure he stayed between me and the leader, giving me a few seconds to deal with him without fearing being flanked. </p><p>“You killed my brother,” shouted the other follower with a great rage as he tried to stab me with his own spear, but his jab ended up being deflected. Then I pushed the spear into his chest, directly through his ribcage and to his heart. He collapsed, unable to utter a word. </p><p>The sly one didn’t miss that. “Keep her busy,” he shouted to his companion before dashing toward me, but instead of joining his leader, he suddenly stopped halfway in the distance, took a turn, and dashed toward the forest, fleeing the battle. </p><p>“Coward!” called the leader, his expression falling as he tried to process the sudden turn of events, where two of his followers died and one of them ran away cowardly instead of helping him to finish a battle that only happened due to his bidding. His morale fell further when a distinctly male voice let out a bloodcurdling scream, and a look showed his last follower falling on the ground, his face destroyed by a magical blast. </p><p>He took several steps back. From his expression, it was clear he understood his fate, and satisfaction flashed on the redhead’s face. Though, when he pulled a small figurine from his bag and pointed at us, her comfort was replaced by a thick panic. “Stop him!” she shouted even as she sent a bolt of magical energy toward him hurriedly, the spell falling apart midway. </p><p>It didn’t connect with the leader, because halfway in, the leader broke the figurine. It turned out to be some kind of spell storage, and a thick wall of flame flowed toward us, large enough to cover both of us. It was strong, but nowhere near enough to threaten me. Destroying it was trivial, but killing the leader meant potentially more people seeking me out. Even hunting the one that escaped was not a solution, because I didn’t know whether they had any supporters that would follow. I already had a group following me, no need to have a second. </p><p>It was easier to play dead, and luckily, there was a huge ravine close to us that would be perfect for that objective. I created a shield to protect me even as I dashed toward the redhead, whose fear prevented her shield from forming despite her best effort, and stood in front of her. The flames washed over my shield, failing to touch the both of us. At that moment I closed my eyes and cast a light spell, my lack of control working for my benefit as I heard him shouting in pain. </p><p>The redhead looked at me in shock, blanching as she realized I was even stronger than what I had displayed against the thunder bear. Before moving, I cast a simple spell to a large rock near the ravine, which hit the walls with a hard thud before reaching the river, exploding with a big splash. </p><p>With the absence of our bodies explained to the temporarily-blinded leader of the small band of marauders, I grabbed the arm of the redhead and dragged her along. She put up no resistance, smart enough to understand the power difference and its implications. We moved until we were hidden behind a nearby rock, observing as the leader started stumbling away without bothering to search for our bodies, his confidence in the flame spell and his temporary blindness working in my favor, the splash long confirmed our death in his mind. </p><p>I watched until he left the opening, and then turned toward the redhead. “So, beautiful,” I said gently even as I turned to her. “Why don’t you tell me who you are, and why you decided to make your problems mine?” </p>",

    "content": "<p>For a while, I said nothing in favor of watching Lillian’s expression change as I gently rubbed the soles of her feet. It was a beautiful sight, her naked body barely visible under the shimmering surface of the water with strands of her beautiful hair sticking to her shoulders in their wetness.  </p><p>It was a pity that she was too distracted by the possibility of her communications being intercepted. </p><p>I didn’t say anything and let her process by herself, not willing to raise the other possibility that there was a traitor in her house that arranged her kidnapping. After all, no matter how capable, I didn’t believe a pirate would have dared to take such a risk without a high chance of success and remotely listening to scraps of communication was not enough. However, I didn’t want to mention the possibility without any evidence, because it would make her worry unnecessarily. </p><p>I needed her unencumbered by such silly emotions for tonight. </p><p>As I expected, it didn’t take long for her attention to shift, away from the long term implications of the breach, back to the present. When I noticed her blush once more, signaling that she was once again aware of the implications of sharing a naked bath together, I brought my hands to her calves, caressing them softly, and enjoying the way she shivered, unrelated to the coldness of the water. “Maybe we should rest,” she murmured shyly. </p><p>“Not a bad idea,” I said casually while my hands climbed up her thighs, dangerously close to her entrance. “But we should do that after cleaning ourselves thoroughly. Maybe a massage to help you recover from the exertion,” I explained. </p><p>“Really-YYY!” she said, her sarcastic response turning into a shocked moan as I caressed her entrance, making her moan. She tried to look angry when she found herself under my amused gaze, but my finger around her knob prevented her from saying anything, converting her words to moans.</p><p>“Did you say something?” I asked, not bothering to hide the amusement in my tone as she trembled under my touch once more. Her inability to answer left her frustrated, but after the adrenaline-filled escape, her body was too alert to suppress her pleasure. </p><p>Sometimes, danger was the best aphrodisiac. </p><p>Seeing that she was busy biting her cheeks to hide her moans -rather unsuccessfully i might add- I decided to push forward. I grabbed her waist with my other hand and pulled her onto my lap. Distracted by the pleasure, she reacted only when she landed on my lap, her back pressing against my chest, my shaft trapped between her tight asscheeks. It was a pity that I promised to respect her virginity, preventing me from plunging inside her mercilessly. </p><p>“What are you doing!” she exclaimed, this time her shock enough to overcome her pleasure. </p><p>“Helping you clean,” I whispered as one of my hands grabbed her breast while the other continued to caress her entrance gently, relying on a ridiculous pretense. “Why, are you complaining?” I added. </p><p>“Yes!” she said immediately, and then followed it with a moan when I caressed her entrance. “No!” she corrected herself instinctively while my fingers sank deeper into her breast. “I don’t know,” she said at last, her tone reflecting excitement and arousal in equal amounts. </p><p>“Then, why don’t we discover the answer together,” I whispered into her ear, making her shiver. She didn’t respond verbally, but the way she leaned back and parted her legs, giving me full access to her body was enough of an answer. I let my hands roam over her body, moving back and forth freely without consequence as I pushed her arousal higher while also getting rid of all the dirt and grime our bodies collected during our desperate escape. Miraculously, she managed to keep herself from moaning, for a while, at least.  </p><p>Then, I leaned forward and pressed my lips to her neck, biting her softly for a moment before my lips started to dance over her skin. In response, her hips started to dance up and down, massaging my shaft nicely. “Better,” I whispered in approval even as I used a flare of mana to freeze a small ice cube, and circled it around her nipple. She shivered sexily, tempting me to push forward. </p><p>It was a pity that I promised not to touch her virginity. </p><p>Still, it wasn’t exactly a huge pity, I decided as I caressed her entrance once more while her hips rocked, her tight asscheecks doing their best to imprison my shaft between them. If those snotty noble boys who had done their best to pursue her only to be dismissed again and again had seen her on my lap, naked and obedient as I nibbled on her neck and teased her with an ice cube, they would have gone crazy. Unfortunately for those assholes, for tonight, Lillian was my little noble toy. </p><p>“So, tell me, Lillian, do you like this?” I said even as my fingers once again probed her entrance, making her shiver helplessly. </p><p>I liked the way she turned to face me, once again her shyness showing itself at my reminder, with guilt mixed in. She knew that what she  was doing was extremely wrong, but her desires, combined with my impressive heroism prevented her from acting on that guilt. Instead, she obediently nodded, and when I leaned forward, accepted my kiss obediently. </p><p>It was all I needed to let my fingers loose on her body mercilessly. My left hand teased her clit again and again, even occasionally slipping inside whenever she was too distracted by my kiss, while my right hand dragged the conjured ice cube mercilessly along her nipples, contrasting the warmth of the spring we were bathing in. </p><p>Under my determined assault, it wasn’t shocking for her to start shivering once again under my touch, trying to resist another orgasm. When she collapsed against my chest, I let her breathe for a while. After all, several orgasms and a long chase scene was difficult to handle. </p><p>But when I saw that she was about to fall asleep, I captured her lips in a domineering kiss without warning, the invasion of my tongue doing wonders to dispel her drowsiness. Then, just as she was getting in the mood, I pushed her back a bit, and under her confused glare, pulled myself out of the water, and sat on the corner of the spring, my legs still in the water.</p><p>Her lack of understanding only lasted until I pointed at the massive monster between my legs, waiting for a release for too long. After everything that had happened today, I had no intention of going to sleep with blue-balls. “It’s time to continue where we left off,” I said with a smirk. </p><p>“I…” she murmured in shock, her eyes firmly locked on my shaft, no doubt trying to process just how dangerously close it was to truly ruining her. She took a deep breath as she tried to gather her wits, but her eyes stayed locked on my shaft. “I can’t do it,” she said, in a way she clearly thought came off as determined, but her fascinated gaze undermined her position. She stood up, the water barely deep enough to cover her thighs, but she didn’t bother to cover her body with her arms. </p><p>“Come on, princess,” I said lightly as I leaned back a bit, which only highlighted my erection further. “Don’t you think that it’s unfair not to reciprocate after everything I have done for you,” I added even as I examined her body without bothering to hide my desire. </p><p>“I…” she repeated, trying to look determined, but failing halfway. “I have never done something like this before!” </p><p>“Don’t worry, princess. I’ll teach you,” I said and presented my hand to her, and, despite knowing where it would lead, she closed the distance. “Excellent,” I said even as I led her hand to my thigh. “Now, crouch down,” I ordered, and she fulfilled that order readily, dwindling the distance between my shaft and her beautiful lips.  </p><p>Her fingers were trembling as she wrapped them around the base of my shaft, her eyes widening a bit more when her fingers failed to connect. She looked at me with shock, and I just smirked, knowing that she was trying to imagine how it would fit her mouth. </p><p>“Tell me what you are going to do?” I said. </p><p>“You can’t be serious!” she exclaimed, looking scandalized, but the important detail was her fingers were still wrapped around my shaft. </p><p>“What?” I answered with a mocking smirk. “Are you saying that you’re willing to suck my cock, but you’re too weak to say you are?” </p><p>She took another deep breath, but the explosion I expected failed to come to fruition. Instead, she avoided my gaze as her lips parted. “How dare you,” she said, but her words were weak, without any weight. </p><p>“Why wouldn’t I dare?” I said. “You were rather happy when I licked and fingered you to orgasm several times. Is it too wrong to actually want retribution?” </p><p>She whispered in response. “You’re right.” </p><p>“Then say what you are going to do to  pay me back,” I asked her, enjoying the way she trembled. </p><p>“I’m going to…” she murmured before taking a deep breath, but continuing with a whisper that would have been impossible to hear without the changes my body was going through. “… suck you.” </p><p>“Good girl,” I said as I patted her head gently. “Then, suck it,” I said as I gently grabbed her head and gently pulled her forward until her lips pressed against my head, and my shaft trembled, more from the importance of the moment rather than the sensation itself. Here I was, alone with one of the most prestigious heiresses in the school, and she was about to willingly suck me like a two-bit whore. </p><p>I was impressed when she opened her mouth obediently and moved her head forward, engulfing the tip with her warmth. She moved back and forth a bit, her eyes firmly shut. I pulled my hands away, curious just how far she was going to go on her first attempt. </p><p>The answer turned out to be not that far. She pulled back a few seconds later, her eyes firmly avoiding me. “How was it?” she asked in a trembling tone. </p><p>“Not bad for a start, but be careful with the teeth, and of course, don’t be afraid to go deep.” </p><p>That managed to turn her gaze back to my face. “You want me to go deeper!” she asked, clearly having no idea what constituted a good blowjob. </p><p>“Of course, princess,” I said. “I want you to swallow at least half of it.” </p><p>“Half,” she repeated in shock as she moved her hand upward in shock as she tried to measure my length. “But that’s impossible!” </p><p>“Don’t tell me you can’t even measure some peasants?” I said mercilessly. “So much for noble superiority.” </p><p>“You- how - but!” she sputtered in shock, but seeing my dismissive shrug, her eyes were on fire once more. She was smart enough to realize that I was goading her, but the pride of a woman was an interesting thing. “I’ll show you my superiority for once, then mock you as I invade your dreams,” she said heatedly, then leaned forward without even waiting for a response, pushing deep. </p><p>“Good girl,” I said once more as she actually pushed herself halfway down my shaft despite a gag that escaped her mouth, and looked at me victoriously. I didn’t know what she was expecting, but seeing her watching me victoriously while trying to open her mouth as much as possible to accommodate my shaft, but the site of it managed to trigger my new instincts once more, begging for me to dominate her. </p><p>This time, I was too aroused to resist. </p><p>“Good attempt,” I said as I put my hands to the back of her head, cutting off her escape route. “But now we’re going to do the real thing. Open your mouth as much as possible, and relax,” I ordered, unlike the other times, my tone neither calm nor mocking. Instead, a deep rumble escaped my mouth, more animal than human, something I didn’t know I was capable of.  </p><p>Lillian trembled. </p><p>She trembled, but it wasn’t fear I saw flaring in her eyes for a moment before she firmly shut them and swallowed my shaft. Instead, it was submission, triggered by my primal tone. That expression destroyed the last of my restraint, and I pushed deep into her throat, her gags echoing in the cave. </p><p>Her determination to keep her eyes closed didn’t last long when I pushed deeper into her throat, widening in shock to reveal her beautiful eyes in a novel expression. I ignored her failure to breath, and slowly pushed deeper in her throat, her throat wrapping around me nicely even as a bulge appeared. </p><p>“I’m impressed, I didn’t expect you to handle the full length,” I said, ignoring her obvious distress as she tried to breathe. Though, considering her hands laid on my legs obediently rather than trying to push back, I doubted her distress was aimed at making me stop. Even if it was, I wasn’t sure I would be able to control my own desires. </p><p>Letting my new instincts win was obviously dangerous, but seeing Lillian’s pouty lips around the base of my shaft while she struggled to breathe was not something that helped me control my desire. My instincts took control as I moved forward a bit, enough for my feet to press on the bottom of the spring before cutting loose, drilling into her throat mercilessly. </p><p>Then, without a warning, I pulled back, leaving her gasping and coughing helplessly. “What was that?” she managed to say between her attempts to breathe. </p><p>“That, princess, was a deepthroat,” I said in the same animalistic voice even as I held her beautiful blonde locks around my fist, but refrained from pulling her once more. “Why? Do you have a problem with it?” </p><p>She waited a moment to look down, courage shining in her eyes. Unfortunately, that ended up to be short lived under my gaze, melting quickly to leave its place to obedience, and without me pushing, she leaned forward to wrap her lips around my shaft once more. It surprised me at first, but it became clear when I saw my reflection in the water, the sharpness of my expression rivaling my tone, dangerous and animalistic. </p><p>It was another piece of evidence of my transformation, and once again I found myself discarding it in favor of the lips moving deeper on my shaft. I couldn’t help but chuckle as I pushed it deep once more, earning another string of gasps and gags. This time, I kept her pinned as I rammed into her again and again as my own explosion continued to build up. </p><p>I continued despite her involuntary tears, only pulling back halfway back occasionally to let her breathe enough to keep her conscious, while she proved herself by obediently taking my attention. I pulled back at the last second, covering her elegant noble face with my seed much to her shock. She wanted to argue, clearly, but she was too busy trying to breathe to do so. </p><p>I once again sat on the corner of the spring, watching her gasping for air. She didn’t collapse into the water only because her hand was on my thigh, supporting her. It would be a lie to say that I wasn’t tempted to continue, but I had one problem. My new instincts were pushing for me to do the same thing. Worse, after letting them get away with it once, they were even stronger. </p><p>I needed to stay in control, which was why I pulled out of the water while she desperately tried to wash her face. I wanted to order her to keep it on her face, but I was afraid of succeeding. If she actually listened to my command to keep her face covered with my cum, controlling those instincts would become impossible. </p><p>So, I stepped out of the cave and quickly cut a couple bushels of grass and pulled some soft-looking branches. After using a simple earth spell to beat and squeeze them several times, I created a soft material, enough to make it into a temporary bed. </p><p>When I returned to the cave, Lillian was pulling herself out of the water, her body even sexier as it shone in its wetness, dripping water down it and reminding me of a water nymph. Unfortunately, I ignored the sight in favor of quickly building a bed, not trusting myself to keep back. “You can stay back and sleep for a while,” I said, knowing that she was exhausted enough even without my latest treatment. “I’m going to hunt for a bit.” </p><p>She nodded. I was unable to solve the complicated gaze she sent my way, and with her naked body tempting me, I didn’t spend a lot of time solving that either. “Okay,” she said in a soft voice. </p><p>I nodded and stepped out, hoping to find a decent hunt, and maybe test the limits of my new ability in the process…</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

We were in the middle of the wilderness, and if there was anyone close enough to hear us, we had bigger problems. “Really,” I said instead. “That’s your big reaction to the school being infiltrated by a necromancer of unknown power?”</p><p>“It’s not like I can do anything about that part,” she said, but I was happy to note a blush on her face as she realized her rather selfish perspective. “And are you sure my absence wouldn’t be more attention grabbing anyway,” she added, trying to make it sound like a logical argument, but I could hear the desperation in her tone. </p><p>“Come on, booksie,” Aviada cut in, smirking, her arms crossed on her chest. “It wouldn’t kill you to stay away from your real lovers for a few nights.” </p><p>“But I just gained a new skill for spell architecture,” Helga murmured, reminding me more of a child than a self-possessed ambitious woman ready to challenge every adversary for her own ambitions. “It’s an unfair sacrifice.” </p><p>“And I have to loan my precious sword again and again,” Aviada cut in with an annoying smirk. “We all make sacrifices.” </p><p>As much as I liked to see casual banter between them, it also cost us a lot of time. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have limited myself to two quickies to activate the mana regeneration perk before cutting into the wilderness. I took a step back, and two slaps exploded on their bottoms, one for each. “Come on, girls, pay attention,” I said. “We don’t have a lot of time to waste, we need to improve your levels as much as possible in the next few days.” </p><p>I had no doubt that anyone else would have received a deriding scoff for daring to mention the potential to gain even a level in a few days, not to mention multiple levels, but since yesterday’s expedition had resulted in three levels, I had a lot of leeway to mention such a thing. I received two shy nods before the girls donned their game faces and turned their attention outward. We were currently in the Soundless Canyon, a place famous for its deadliness even for high-powered parties, so we all needed to be on high alert. </p><p>I chose the canyon for two reasons. First, danger meant stronger creatures, which in turn meant quicker leveling. Second, and the more important part was that the canyon was in the opposite direction from our encounter, making it unlikely for us to be caught by the necromancer scouts that were doubtlessly sent. I would be lying if I hadn’t been tempted to hunt those. Their intrusion to the library felt really personal. After all, for better or for worse, that place had been the closest thing to a home for me, not to mention my damnable curse was broken there. </p><p>That place was special, and it annoyed me to see it soiled by undead trash. </p><p>Still, I was self-aware enough to realize antagonizing a faction of unknown strength and capabilities required more than a sense of annoyance. Yesterday’s encounter and my impulsive decision to slay the shade had been rather unforgivable. It was for the best if they had never learned of my identity. </p><p>“Helga, this is for you,” I said just after I incapacitated another Earth Serpent with a swing of my sword. Those were a dangerous species of creature famous for their ambushes, bursting through the ground with little warning, their jaws strong enough to threaten even the strongest warrior. Luckily, my earth magic allowed me to detect the vibration they created, allowing me to reverse their ambushes easily, making them easy targets. The girls, who long since lost their shock at my prowess of destroying class twelve creatures with a swing, were satisfied with the easy experience. </p><p>“Another detection spell?” Helga said even as she sank her dagger into the helpless serpent’s brain stem, having long gotten used to delivering finishing hits.</p><p>I just nodded as I focused on my palm, creating another ball of ephemeral energy, holding it still for several seconds for Helga to examine. When she nodded I triggered a nova, its presence washing over my body like a warm blanket. </p><p>[-24 Mana]</p><p>[+1 Biomancy]</p><p>“It’s better than the last time,” she said with a cute frown as she stayed focused on my palm. “At least this time you managed to keep your connection with the life energy for twenty feet before you lost control.” </p><p>“It’s progress. If those dead bastards can throw their rotten energy left and right, I should be able to do the same with the reverse,” I said with a shrug even as I conjured another ball, this time trying to put more power in it, but it destabilized and exploded as a ball, washing over us calmly, wasting a lot of mana. Manipulating pure life energy from a distance was much harder than I had been expecting. On a positive note, I felt my exhaustion disappear, and from the rejuvenated expression on their faces, the girls experienced the same. </p><p>[-60 Mana]</p><p>“Do you really think that you can copy their approach? Necrotic energy is much more malleable than life energy,” Helga said with a concentrated expression, the one she had whenever she had a complicated problem. </p><p>“Of course. I already had a preliminary success, and it has been just a day since I have started working on it,” I said with a scoff. “I can’t believe no one else had tried this.” </p><p>Helga slapped my shoulder. “Not everyone has virtually endless mana to throw around.” She stopped for a moment. “Or they have good enough stats to take generic biomancy instead of healing. You’re the only one I know that has a chance to use such a wasteful spell.” </p><p>I shrugged. “If it works,” I said with a smirk. </p><p>Aviada cut in. “God damn it, Gaius, you’re making me feel like an idiot. Is there anything you can’t do well?” </p><p>“I’m not that good at throwing,” I answered modestly. That was one combat area I was planning to neglect. </p><p>“What are you talking about,” Aviada answered. “I have seen you hitting a moving target a hundred feet away with a throwing knife.” </p><p>“Yeah, but it hit its arm,” I explained. “I was aiming for the eye.” Aviada snorted as she leaned down, busy digging out the fangs of the earth serpent. They weren’t venomous, but they were still valuable, and more importantly, they were easy to carry. After that, we moved on, leaving the carcass behind, even through my heart ached for wasting a small fortune. Unfortunately, we weren’t in a position to hide those valuables. </p><p>The next three hours passed nicely. We came across a large nest of Kappa in addition to the serpents, pushing the girls close to a level up. Meanwhile, I continued to work on my detection spell, wasting a lot of mana but improving the spell quite a bit. The significant improvement of my biomancy was a welcome bonus as well. </p><p>[-546 Mana]</p><p>[+12 Biomancy]</p><p>“I think I got it,” I said with a smirk as I converted a nice chunk of mana to life energy and converting it into a stable ball before releasing it, feeling it spread around for several hundred feet without losing connection. </p><p>“It seems stable,” Helga said. “It’s a pity that we can’t use necrotic energy to test-” she continued, only to be cut when I suddenly pressed my hand on her lips. </p><p>Her annoyed expression left its place to panic when I spoke. “The spell detected something,” I said, quite surprised myself, not to mention feeling panicked. </p><p>“Are you sure?” Aviada said as her grip tightened around her sword. </p><p>“Not a hundred percent,” I answered. “It’s still a new spell, and there’s no guarantee that it’s working correctly. Before last night, I would’ve written it off as paranoia, but if they are strong enough to actually penetrate the school, we can’t afford to write it off as a coincidence.” </p><p>“We’re not going to ignore this, are we?” Aviada asked, looking ready to push forward already. </p><p>“Can we take the risk?” Helga asked. “The last time we almost died, and they underestimated us.” </p><p>I understood Helga’s point. We had just got rid of a sizable force, and if they were being led by a half-decent commander, they would be on alert. “I really don’t want to, but we can’t afford to ignore it. The situation is worse than I first thought, and getting rid of that shade and yesterday’s team might have galvanized them into early action. I need to check to make sure.” </p><p>“You meant we, right?” Aviada said, her tone sharp. </p><p>“Unfortunately, no,” I said even as I passed her sword back to Aviada. “I would move faster if I’m alone.” She looked like she was about to complain, but I waved my hand. “No, we can’t afford to fight. We’re going to retreat first and you’re going back to the school. I don’t want you to be out in case they get suspicious. They are already in the school, so they can check the records to see who was outside when they lost the battle.” </p><p>Both Aviada and Helga looked dissatisfied, but they were sensible enough to understand the reasoning. “Keep the sword at least,” Aviada said, trying to pass the sword to me once more.</p><p>“No, that’s too recognizable. They already have spies in the school, I don’t want them targeting you,” I said decisively, which put a small blush on Aviada’s face. “Moreover, this time, I’m not planning to fight but scout the opposition, so it won’t be necessary.” </p><p>I looked at my surroundings as I escorted the girls outside the canyon, not wanting to keep them near the event. I was confident in my abilities, and even if I was detected, I could trigger a landslide to escape. The natural limits and concealment that made the place a pain in the ass when fighting against the monsters were a bonus if I suddenly found myself against another undead horde. However, if I was forced to that point, trying to protect the girls while trying to run would have been too much even for me. </p><p>Soon, we arrived at the protection of the wards once again. “Do you want us to stay close, just in case,” asked Helga with a worried expression. </p><p>“Thanks for the offer, but I want you two to be visibly away from here,” I explained as I put my arm on her waist. “But I appreciate the offer,” I added, pulling her close for a kiss, and Helga responded enthusiastically, her body smashing against mine. It would be a lie if I said I wasn’t tempted for another quickie, especially since Aviada was watching us with hungry eyes, no doubt willing to join the moment we started. Unfortunately, I had a bad feeling about the undead presence, and didn’t want to delay anymore. </p><p>So, reluctantly, I pulled away from Helga, and after a goodbye kiss from Aviada -no less passionate- I was walking toward the canyon once more. It was not a good sign to come across undead wherever I walked. There was clearly a bigger plan, dangerous enough to target the school itself. </p><p>Though, as much as I wanted to protect the library because of my emotional entanglement, I was also aware I could be revealed. Earning some goodwill beforehand just in case would help immensely.</p><p>As I moved deeper into the canyon, I turned my attention back to more immediate concerns. As I moved, an oppressive feeling of death and decay filled the air, so much that I had to cast a warding spell to protect myself from the uncomfortable sensation while simultaneously hiding my presence. </p><p>[-12 Mana]</p><p>[+1 Biomancy]</p><p>Sensing that I was close to the center, I didn’t dare to cast my detection spell, afraid that necromancers would detect its presence. Hence the reason I was almost caught when a black robed figure suddenly appeared around the corner, forcing me to duck behind a large rock, glad that their presence had driven the monsters away. </p><p>I watched with a frown as the necromancer picked a central location and started drawing a large hermetic circle. Both the design and the runes themselves were unfamiliar, but the energy that was spreading from it was even more disgusting than the necrotic energy. Thankfully, it was rather muted, possibly because it wasn’t activated yet. </p><p>The necromancer left the area after it was completed. I cast a detection spell to make sure I was alone in the area before walking closer to the array, trying to examine it through my arcana abilities. But the moment my mana touched one of the runes, it awakened, and it started invading my spell. I forcefully terminated the spell, and expelled a large amount of mana to make sure corruption didn’t invade my body.   </p><p>[-245 Mana]</p><p>Of course, such a flare of magic had doubtlessly alerted the necromancers to my presence, so I dashed toward the canyon walls once more, this time climbing upward several feet before creating a cave on the surface, one that closed behind me the moment I stepped in, only a small crack remaining. </p><p>I watched as three robed figures dashed towards the opening, their hands already glowing with the sickly gray of their death magic. “What was that surge?” asked one of them as he looked around carefully. He was the one that built the circle. “Are we under attack?”</p><p>I felt annoyed. I put myself into a deadly danger because of a moment’s carelessness, and I had no illusions about my hiding place. Thankfully, my luck held up, and one of the others spoke after looking around cursorily.“Don’t worry, the leftovers are obviously corrupted. Lictus screwed up, again,” he said, his derision was clear. </p><p>“Say that again!” the first one bellowed, clearly unhappy about the insult. </p><p>With that, two necromancers argued for a while until the third on cut in. “Enough,” he called angrily. “Stop acting like children. We still have several nodes to create.” </p><p>“But-” one of them said until the leader cut him off once again. </p><p>“Enough,” he said, and continued when the other seemed ready to cut it off. “If you want to explain to the boss why the trap is not ready, go ahead, keep arguing. I’m sure he will be understanding.” </p><p>Referring to their mysterious boss solved the situation quickly. They stopped bickering and started examining the runic node with a rapid discussion between them. When they determined the array was working as it was supposed to, they disappeared in different directions, too busy to ask why a perfectly working array had resulted in a surge. </p><p>Before leaving my hiding spot, I needed to decide what to do. The array was clearly dangerous, so much so that if I hadn’t already positioned myself as an enemy of them, I might have chosen to leave. If my situation was ever revealed, it wouldn’t have taken a genius to match my presence with their recent setbacks. Since I had already declared war, weakening them further was an obvious choice. </p><p>Once again I walked to the magical node, examining it carefully. I had learned from my mistakes, so instead of pushing my magic into the array, I examined it passively. With my limited time, I wasn’t able to discover a lot about the array, but I managed to discover how to track its connection to other nodes. </p><p>It left me with another challenge, namely, how to take action. Destroying it outright was not an option because it would have alerted the necromancers. Deciphering it might have been a viable choice if I had enough time and access to the library, but I didn’t know when it would be triggered, so that was not a viable option as well. </p><p>In the end, I decided to learn from the example, and created a small explosive array linked to the control one. The explosive array was a small but ingenious combination of arcana and earth elemental effects. Arcana to maintain the connection and trigger, earth elemental to destroy the foundation of the node, therefore harming the array. </p><p>There was one problem, I didn’t know whether destroying one node would be enough to hamper its effects. </p><p>Since the necromancers were working hard on its construction, it would be foolish for me to assume that the loss of one node would destroy the integrity of the whole array. Luckily, I was able to discover the connection between the arrays, so finding the others wouldn’t have been difficult. </p><p>Decision made, I started following the ephemeral lines of connection between the nodes, occasionally avoiding patrols while I planted my explosive traps near each node, each concealed under the nodes’ intimidating corrupting glow. </p><p>I managed to trap almost twenty nodes when the necromancers suddenly dashed toward the center of the array. I followed them instead of doing the smart thing, as I couldn’t help but feel curious about the aim of this huge array, trusting my abilities to keep me hidden in the canyon. As I moved, I trapped several more nodes, much easier now that the patrols were pulling to the central location. </p><p>When I arrived at the center of the array, I was suddenly glad that I decided to stay, because even seeing the complicated patterns of the central array gave me a better understanding of wardmaking. It was truly a masterpiece. Too bad that it was developed by the necromancers and I had to destroy it. </p><p>Then, just before I could activate the array, I felt its presence disappearing, which reinforced my expectation that it was a trap. The question was, for whom?</p><p>The answer I received a minute later, when two figures dashed into the canyon, one unfamiliar figure wrapped in several arcana glows as it escaped, carrying a book in hand as he dashed away. But my attention was grabbed by the figure that was following it. It was the head librarian, covered in lightning, her anger visible even from a great distance as she pursued. </p><p>Shocked by her appearance, I forgot to trigger my explosives until I felt the array stirring, its softness belying the dangerous threat it presented. </p><p>I didn’t know if it aimed to kill the head librarian, or something worse, but either way, I knew that I couldn’t have allowed it. “Librarian! Be careful!” I shouted even as I activated my explosives, hoping that it would be enough… </p><p><br></p><p> [Level: 17    Experience: 146150 / 153000 </p><p>Strength: 18    Charisma: 25</p><p>Precision: 13    Perception: 14</p><p>Agility: 17     Manipulation: 20</p><p>Speed: 13       Intelligence: 17</p><p>Endurance: 14      Wisdom: 21</p><p>HP: 1275 / 1275    Mana: 1621 / 1649        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>[Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Expert Arcana [75/75]   </p><p>Expert  Elemental [75/75]</p><p>Expert Biomancy [64/75]     </p><p>Advanced Subterfuge [50/50]         </p><p>Basic Speech [25/25]        ]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p>",

    "content": "<p>Imagining the expression of Cornelia as her arousal was slowly dismissed put a smile on my face. I would have liked to be there, watching as her joy and arousal was replaced by horror as she understood just what she had signed up for. Also, if I had stayed there for the night, it would have made the process even smoother, allowing me to suppress any sign of rebellion before it even started. </p><p>However, I had more important things to do. </p><p>The encounter with the necromancers spooked me, not only because I had met with a danger much stronger than what was supposed to exist, but because it showed me just how little I knew about my surroundings. I needed more information. Luckily, as a library worker, I was in the epicenter of information. Sneaking into the library in the middle of the night wasn’t even a challenge for me, and more importantly, I had a ready excuse if I got caught. </p><p>My abominable reputation was occasionally helpful. </p><p>After entering the library, I ignored my usual destination, the shelves on magical theory or leveling, instead moving to where historical battle records were held. I knew a lot about battle tactics and abilities of necromancers as well as many other fringe organizations because they were talked about in detail in the magical theory books, but I had no idea what their aim was, or the reason for their existence. </p><p>After quickly skimming through several books, however, I wasn’t any closer to the answer of those questions. From what I could discover, their existence stretched back for hundreds of years, but there was nothing definite about their origin, which was suspicious. Not because the lack of information itself, but there were also very few theorizing anything about their roots, which was weird considering that despite their sparse existence, the necromancers were allied across the continent, and knowing their origins would have allowed a much better understanding about their organization. </p><p>The more I read about it, the more suspicious I got. It was like they were intentionally avoiding finding an answer, making me even more curious about its roots. But no matter how many books I browsed, I wasn’t any closer to its source. Soon, the idea solidified in my mind even further. It was known, but was being kept hidden for some reason. </p><p>Before I could delve deeper, however, a chilly sensation passed near me. If it had been any other time, I would have dismissed it as a night chill, but I had remembered that exact sensation from earlier, where I had been fighting against the undead. It was necrotic energy, only much weaker than what I felt against the horde, so weak that I doubted I would have been able to feel it without my biomancy. Feeling the same energy in the middle of Silver Spires was not a good sign. The smart thing would have been to turn my back and leave the library. My identity was already tricky without angering a nebulous organization with a horde of death at their beck and call. </p><p>However, in the end, my curiosity won, and I started following the energy from a distance. Soon, I was close enough to the source to see a shade moving deeper into the library. It was both good and bad at the same time, because while shades were excellent scouts, they were utterly rubbish when it came to any kind of confrontation. Their value lay in their near-invisibility to any kind of senses. Too bad it caught me when I was most alert against that kind of energy. </p><p>However, there was a complication. Like any necrotic construct, their range of control was limited, meaning there was actually a necromancer in the confines of the school controlling it. That was dangerous news, no matter the situation. Necromancers sneaking into the school easily was not good news, but it was still better compared to the alternative. Moreover, shades contained a small piece of soul from their creator, meaning they couldn’t be given to others to use. They needed to be near their creator. </p><p>The school had a traitor inside. </p><p>I doubted anyone other than myself would have reached that conclusion that easily, but I was the living proof that the vaunted security of the school was less than perfect against a sneaky approach once the initial infiltration was successful. It was supposed to be impossible for a necromancer to hide their unique aura, but I was the evidence that saying something was impossible didn’t make it so. </p><p>With that in mind, I continued following the shade, but being careful to stay hidden, only to receive another shock. The shade arrived in front of the vault and slipped through the wards while taking a complicated route. Another evidence of long-term infiltration, otherwise, the shade would have never known the way to bypass the wards that easily. I waited outside, while trying to understand the point of sending the shade into the vault. Shades didn’t have physical presence, so they wouldn’t be able to take a book from the book. Even flipping a page to read a book was above its capabilities. </p><p>Regardless, I followed it when it left the vault as easily as it entered. Its controller clearly had a reason to send it there, and I was still curious about its owner. Luckily, shades had another drawback, that they couldn’t communicate their findings remotely. They needed to be reabsorbed by their creator. So, I followed from a distance, hoping to find the owner. I had been expecting it to go toward the creature forest, giving me the opportunity to spy on the owner, maybe even ambush them in the dark. </p><p>I received another shock when the creature started moving toward the central section, where the most prestigious professors lived. The situation was even worse than I had thought. It was either one of the keystones of the school was traitor, or a necromancer was hidden there, good enough to avoid the detection of the best the school had to offer. Combined with the three necromancers I had faced, it pointed to a disaster. </p><p>I was a selfish person, but not selfish enough to do nothing after stumbling on a situation dangerous enough to threaten Silver Spires. I decided to take action. I took a breath to still my trembling hand before sending a jolt of arcana energy, destroying the shade, therefore preventing its controller from learning whatever they were trying to get. Then I dashed away, my heart thumping crazily. </p><p>I cast several arcana spells rapidly to hide my presence before dashing back to my room, fearful and excited at the same time. I could almost feel eyeballs on my back, afraid of being caught. Unless I had been severely underestimating the undercover necromancer, they were already aware of the destruction of the shade. I had no doubt that if they weren’t worried about blowing their cover, they would have already caught me. But they didn’t have the luxury of raising alarm, not more than I do. </p><p>I tried to sleep, but it proved elusive, rejecting to arrive no matter how many twists and turns I had to take. Luckily, the library wasn’t the only place that held distractions for me. I had another destination where my imposition would be greeted with enthusiasm while also helping me to level up. So, I stepped into the corridors once more and started walking, glad that Marianne’s room was not close to the central residential or the library itself. Even if someone was searching, a servant walking around in the middle of the night, carrying stuff, was not something to pay attention to. </p><p>Sneaking into Marianne’s room was a simple task, though after entering, I made sure to put an extra alarm ward just in case. The living room was empty, so I moved to the bedroom, only to meet with an amazing sight. Marianne was on the bed, sleeping with a soft smile on her face, occasionally letting out soft moans. Even more impressive was her body, partially revealed as her covers slid away, displaying her amazing lingerie, pure white, short, and transparent enough to give a hint of skin underneath and to reveal the absence of underwear. Her nipples pushed against her nightie determinedly like they were trying to cut free, making me excited for the next step. </p><p>[+50 Experience] 50% Penalty! </p><p>I quickly shed my clothing and slid into the bed next to her, careful not to wake her up as I pulled her head on my chest. She hugged me immediately as a soft moan left her mouth, but she stayed asleep. Curious about the depth of her sleep, I caressed her shoulder with no effect, before slipping my hand under her nightie to meet with her generous breasts. I gently squeezed, but the only reaction was another sleepy moan, and her nipples hardening even further. So, I squeezed her nipple.</p><p>That managed to awaken her from her sleep. “Such a nice dream,” she murmured as she looked at my face from her barely open eyelids. Since our bodies were close, all she needed was to turn a bit to capture my lips in a soft, fleeting kiss. I continued caressing her breasts while her hand dragged down, slowly tracing my chest first, then my stomach. But a gasp escaped her mouth as she wrapped her hand around my shaft, and looked at me much more alert. “It’s not a dream, is it?” she asked in a trembling voice. </p><p>“Guess,” I answered with a smirk as I initiated another kiss, gentle and slow. Meanwhile, I was enjoying the feeling of her breasts, kneading her impressive globes with a slowly ramping up intensity, her lips following the trend immediately as well. I didn’t know whether it was the sleep grogginess, or whether our last lovemaking session had managed to destroy her shyness, but I was loving her taking initiative. </p><p>[+300 Experience] 50% Penalty! </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 19%]</p><p>Still, I was surprised when I felt a pair of soft hands on my shoulder, pushing me back. I let her succeed, curious what she had in mind with such an aggressive move. She climbed on my lap, hovering over the length of my shaft close enough for me to feel the heat. “Close your eyes,” she whispered in a sudden bout of shyness, and I did so, unable to resist her cuteness, even when I felt her leaving the bed and hurriedly pulling open a closet, followed by the sound of fabric. </p><p>Then, a warmth covered my shaft, and curiosity overcome me, only to see Marianne leaning over my shaft, brushing its top with her tongue while her hand was wrapped on its bottom, gently moving up and down. Moreover, she surprised me with her change of clothing. Her white nightie was gone, replaced by a pure black corset that pushed her already-amazing breasts to perfection. Moreover, from her reflection in the mirror, I could see a very noticeable absence of her panties, replaced by a pair of thigh-high stockings. However, with the cute expression of concentration on her face, she looked like an angel who was doing her best to act rebellious. </p><p>It was a cute view, Marianne gently teasing the crown of my manhood, occasionally pulling back to appreciate the throbbing head before leaning down once again. Then, she did something that surprised me, and plopped an ice cube into her mouth before returning to her task. </p><p>I couldn’t help but gasp in pleasure as the combination of cold and hot assaulted my shaft, though I was equally impressed with Marianne actually going out of her way to try a new trick. She truly managed to impress me. </p><p>[+200 Experience] 50% Penalty! </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 20%]</p><p>I decided to respect her wishes and kept my eyes closed, enjoying the way she moved deeper and deeper with every repeat. Soon, she was holding most of my shaft hostage in her mouth, her hands dancing on the bottom, occasionally slipping down to my balls to enhance the sensation. Minutes passed as she moved back and forth, slowly and sensually like she was worshiping my presence. Understandable, as not only had I taken her virginity in every conceivable way, but I also impressed her by thoroughly defeating her hero in front of her to a point that Cornelia hadn’t been able to react. </p><p>It was going to be fun when I educated Cornelia enough to make her serve us while I was together with Marianne. </p><p>As the time passed, she slowly deserted her slow and sensual motions in favor of wilder, more aggressive activities. As the heat enveloped me deeper and deeper, a gag reached my ear. But Marianne impressed me when instead of pulling back, she pushed even deeper, her hands clamping on my thighs to get extra strength. Soon, the familiar tightness of her throat wrapped around my head, pushing me closer to climax. </p><p>I could have held back, of course, but seeing she had gone through such an effort, I decided to reward her. My shaft started twitching inside her mouth, which she was alert enough to recognize and pulled out a bit, just enough to keep the crown in the perfect position. It wasn’t a scene to be missed, I decided, watching as Marianne was humming in enjoyment as she devoured my seed enthusiastically, managing to catch all of it without spilling any. </p><p>[+300 Experience] 50% Penalty! </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 22%]</p><p>“How was it?” she murmured, her shyness feeling a bit ridiculous considering she was wearing a sexy corset withpanties absent, and had just finished a voluntary blowjob that went much deeper than I would have expected. </p><p>“It was amazing,” I answered as I grabbed her arm and pushed her down. “It’s my turn now,” I said as I leaned down over her, positioning nicely between her legs. I kissed her clit, but it was a sharp, aggressive kiss, one that implied dominance despite the supposed subservience the position implied. I was amused by the way her body jumped, but instead of saying something, I let my tongue work on more important tasks, such as exploring the area surrounding her knob. </p><p>When my tongue moved down, her hips started to move, following my beat to increase her pleasure. “Yes, more please,” she moaned out without bothering to keep her voice down. Her reaction was understandable, considering she was already sopping wet when I started, and her passion only intensified as the time passed. Soon, she was gasping and moaning helplessly while I cut loose, my tongue penetrating her again and again, pushing her closer to a climax.  </p><p>[+200 Experience] 50% Penalty! </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 24%]</p><p>However, I wanted to make the moment of completion where she got her achievement from the system more memorable, so I pulled back which earned me a short-lived disappointed gasp that turned into an excited moan when I hovered above her, ready to take her in the missionary position. “Do you want me?” I asked her as I leaned forward, capturing her in my gaze. </p><p>“I want you,” she murmured helplessly, her chest moving up and down wildly with her breaths. </p><p>“You want me to do what?” I asked again even as I pressed my shaft to her entrance, but didn’t push forward. </p><p>“I want you to … fuck me,” she whispered. I would have made her repeat it, but she gasped with such a thick sense of desire that I decided to have a little mercy and pushed deep inside her. “Yes, fuck me! Hard!” she moaned, her expressiveness surprising me, or maybe I just misunderstood how horny she had been feeling. I slammed into her mercilessly, ferociously, until her expression was dominated with pleasure. I didn’t stop even when she started showing signs of climax, and impaled her until she started shuddering helplessly. </p><p>[+500 Experience] 50% Penalty! </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 25% - First Stage Completed +5000 Exp]</p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Relationship not sufficient for the second stage]</p><p>Level UP!</p><p>[Select one of the following skills: Expert Biomancy, Master Elemental, Basic Observation] </p><p>I quickly chose biomancy despite the combat-related advantages I would have received from improving my elemental skill. After two encounters with necromancers, I wanted to be better prepared against their presence, and biomancy allowed me to directly counter their necrotic energy. </p><p>Meanwhile, Marianne’s eyes popped open in shock in the middle of her arousal. “Do you like your gift?” I said confidently, at this point, aware that she had received an achievement. It was a pity that our relationship had yet to reach a point that would allow us to progress to the second stage, meaning I need to find a way to help her progress, but still, it wasn’t a huge challenge. </p><p>“How? Why?” she murmured dazedly, the shock of receiving an achievement not helping her to process her orgasm. </p><p>“It’s a secret,” I said to her even as I started moving inside her once more. “You need to keep it secret for now, but I can say that it’s just the beginning. Understood?” I added, and she nodded enthusiastically, though I wasn’t sure how much of it was true comprehension and how much of it was her enthusiasm for another session. Regardless, I pulled out and flipped her over before putting my hands on her back, pinning her in place. “Are you ready?” I asked. </p><p>“Yes!” she moaned, which turned into a loud cry as I plunged deep inside her. With my other hand, I grabbed her hair tight, pulling it back enough to give me access to her beautiful neck, sucking and licking to increase her arousal. </p><p>She was in the mood, I had no intention to sleep, so we continued our lovemaking until the sunrise. </p><p>[+5000 Experience] 50% Penalty! </p><p>I would have continued further, but I had another expedition with Helga and Aviada, and after the event with the shade, I had no intention to skip it.

    "content": "<p>Cornelia was busy sending a thick wave of flame toward me when I finally raised my hand and called a thick wall of water to block her assault, costing me a small chunk of mana. Cornelia clearly wasn’t holding back, but I was annoyed because of a different thing. The collusion of magic created a thick cloud of steam, hiding her beautiful body from my sight. </p><p>[-45 Mana]</p><p>I was about to use an arcana trick to dispel the cloud when a shadow cut through the mist. It was Cornelia, trying to finish the combat quickly, unaware that she was making a terrible choice. It wouldn’t have been a bad choice under other circumstances, because almost no mage had physical abilities, meaning she wouldn’t have been disadvantaged, especially if the opponent panicked. Also, it gave her a chance to finish it quickly, a bath in the middle of the school wasn’t the best arena to fight without alerting others. </p><p>It was a pity that it was the absolute worst strategy she could have used against me. Her flaming fist was strong, but it was effectively moving in slow motion against me. I didn’t even bother standing up. A gentle palm strike was enough to change the trajectory of her punch, and when it went past my head, I turned my palm into a grip and pulled her on my lap. “Are you going to play nice, or should I teach you how to behave?” I whispered into her ear as I squeezed her wrist a bit, just enough to signal my physical stats. The fact that she was on my lap, naked was a nice bonus. Pity I couldn’t take her virginity yet. </p><p>[+100 Experience] 50% Penalty!</p><p>When she didn’t answer, I flared my magic, not by casting a particular magic, but to show my potential, enough to make it very certain that I was much stronger than her when it came to the mystical side of the deal as well. “I’ll behave,” she answered, trying to sound belligerent, but it was impossible for her to hide her sudden tremble while she was on my lap.  </p><p>“Good girl,” I said as I patted her leg gently, and when she tried to stand up, I was quick to wrap my arm around her waist, keeping her pinned. </p><p>“Let me go,” she said as she turned toward me, but she must be learning, because this time, she didn’t try to use magic to free herself, relying on her angry expression, with a dash of panic. </p><p>I had no intention to cater to that particular wish. The sooner she got into the habit of following my orders, the better. “I can let you go,” I said, and her expression relaxed, unaware of the part to come. “However, I would take it as you rejecting my generous offer,” I added, and her face fell just as quickly, but even as I loosened my arm around her waist, she stayed in place, thinking hard about my proposal. She was smart enough to realize the full implications of being my maid, not only the sexual parts, but the implied inferiority as well. </p><p>For a whole minute she was silent, and I didn’t disrupt her, not wanting her to commit before she understood the full implications. Also, it gave the aphrodisiac more time to seep into her bloodstream, adding yet another complication to her decision-making process. Soon, I received the first indication that it was working, when she rocked her hips several times like she was trying to get a better seat, several more times than it was necessary. Her body was getting in the mood even if she wasn’t.  </p><p>Since she was struggling to answer, I decided to help her decide. My hands landed on her waist, caressing her sides gently. I decided to speak when she decided to answer angrily. “Is there something you want to say?” I said lazily even as my hands moved down, caressing her lithe hips. When it came to ass, she lacked Helga’s and Marianne’s generous expanse, but she was still very sexy. She just huffed and turned her head away, trying to make a decision. </p><p>Messing with her was extremely satisfying, so I decided to up the ante. One of my hands moved up until I grabbed her breasts, their size barely failing to fill my palms, but compensating for their failing with their perkiness. I directly focused on her nipples, squeezing hard. The moan that left her mouth surprised her more than it surprised me if her expression was any indicator. “Are you sure you don’t want to speak?” I said, amused by her reaction because the aphrodisiac I had given her could never get such a reaction, meaning she enjoyed my rough treatment considerably. Surprising, considering her insistent sadism. </p><p>“Keep your hands to yourself while I’m trying to decide,” she said angrily, but rather than annoy me, it amused me further, because I could see she was relying on a caricature display of anger to suppress her own shock. My plan was working even better than I had intended. </p><p>“And what if I don’t?” I countered as my other hand grabbed her beautiful crimson hair before pulling her head back hard, enough to be actually painful. Another moan left her mouth, recognizable despite her efforts to disguise it as a pained yelp. Her head was bent back, which gave me direct access to her neck. I bit her neck hard enough to earn another moan. Her thighs tightened around my shaft, another sign of her enjoyment. </p><p>[+300 Experience] 50% Penalty!</p><p>With her bluff seen through, she once again failed to come up with an answer. I didn’t push her for it. Why would I when I already found such an amusing way to pass the time. I held her under a double-assault, my fingers mauling her breasts while I alternated biting and sucking on her neck, but both violent enough to leave a mark. She tried to hold back her moans at first, and when that failed, tried to hide them under yelps and grunts, but her attempts failed sexily. </p><p>I could see she was surprised by her reaction even more than I was, but unlike me, her reaction was a fresh surge of anger. I realized the explosion before she did. “That’s enough!” she exclaimed and tried to stand up, but my grip around her hair tightened. “Let me go!” she shouted, but maintained enough presence of mind not to use a spell. </p><p>“I can, but I’m going to be kind and ask you a question,” I said, speaking slowly, each word heavy and measured, with the full weight of my charisma behind it to intimidate her. “Are you sure you want to reject my support?” </p><p>The way Cornelia trembled at my words was delicious, and the fact that she was intimidated rather than lashing out was enough to prove that my way was working. Her lips moved a while later, breaking her frozen state. “I accept,” she murmured. </p><p>“Excellent news,” I said cheerfully before I pushed her away from my lap and stepped out of the water. “Follow me then we have a lot of things to talk about,” I said and started walking. I snapped my fingers after two steps because I didn’t hear her walking. The sound of a splash reached my ears, followed by several rapid footsteps, briefly interrupted by the ruffle of fabrics. I ignored it and continued to walk, using a small cantrip to dry myself. No need to ruin her couch. </p><p>I was going to spend a lot of time here, after all. </p><p>Cornelia appeared through the door several minutes later, her confident mannerism telling me that she had used the small break to gather her confidence, but she was unable to hide the truth from my sharp eyes. It was just a trick on the surface. Underneath, I could see her emotions churning in a panic. I wanted to punish her for daring to be late, but I chose to pause a moment to enjoy the sight of her body. Her long thin legs deliciously disappeared under a thick white towel, but even its thickness was unable to hide her thin waist and her shapely hips from my discerning eye. </p><p>Unfortunately, she had pulled the towel high up on her chest, hiding it from the view, not even a hint of cleavage was present. It seemed that I needed to explain to her about the appropriate behavior for a maid, starting from how not to be late. “What do you think you did wrong?” I asked her. </p><p>“What?” she answered eloquently. </p><p>I sighed. “Come on, firecracker, keep it up. You’re my maid now, and you need to call me sir,” I said dismissively even as I leaned back, putting my muscles on display. No matter what, her eyes trying to catch a glimpse of my body was extremely satisfying, especially with the blush that resulted after she did. </p><p>“If you think that I’m going to call you-” she started, only to be cut off by my angry glare, backed by the presence of my charisma, reminding her who was the boss here. “I’m sorry, sir,” she said instead. Her tone was still rebellious, of course, but it was progress. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said, once again cheerful as I stood up and walked next to her. “It’s going to take a while to properly educate you, but luckily for you, I’m kind enough to put in the time required,” I added even as I put my hand on her waist, leading her toward the table. Even through the towel I could feel her smooth skin, tempting me to cut to the chase and push her down for the true conquest. Unfortunately, slowly teasing and educating the angry queen of the school was too tempting to forgo just like that. </p><p>“I understand, sir,” she managed to say despite her clenched jaw, but her dissatisfaction was nothing compared to the one she would feel during the next stage of my plan. When we arrived at the dining table, I pushed her forward without a warning until she collided with the surface, expelling a painful breath. Her towel rode up, creating a delicious view of her naked bottom. “What the hell-” she managed to exclaim until I interrupted her once again, this time my palm exploding against her naked bottom. </p><p>[+100 Experience] 50% Penalty!</p><p>“Why don’t you try that again?” I said with a gentle tone that greatly contrasted with my painful spank. </p><p>She managed to twist her head enough to look at me, but the angry tirade she was preparing faded against my stern expression. “What was that for, sir?” she replaced her words. Her resentment was still clear, but I let it go unmentioned. After all, it was her first day in her new role. </p><p>I had plenty of time to properly educate her. </p><p>“Because you were late by several minutes after I ordered you to follow me,” I explained. “I was willing to be merciful, then you went and disrespected me. Maybe some punishment will educate you about the perils of talking back.” </p><p>“As you wish, sir,” she answered smoothly, with an undercurrent of pride. She was clearly underestimating my punishment. Understandable, considering the scene between her and Helga I had stumbled on several days ago. She prided herself in her bondage abilities, and my simple spank must have seemed rather simple. </p><p>I couldn’t help but chuckle as I waved my hand, summoning a bag from her wardrobe, dispelling its protections with another flick, which showed her arcana capabilities were extremely poor compared to me. “We can start if you’re feeling ready,” I said even as I pulled a familiar crop from her bag. </p><p>“How?” she asked, shocked, but received a soft hit from the crop, and a quirked eyebrow. “How, sir?” she repeated. </p><p>“Come on, firecracker. You didn’t think you were unnoticed when you were using them in the library, right?” I said, despite her shock when one of the ribbons flew out of the bag under the control of my magic, and tied her hands behind her back. “Where do you think I came up with the idea of making you my maid?” She opened her mouth, but I preempted her by using the crop on her bottom, hard enough to leave a mark. She gasped while I dragged a finger on the mark it left. “It isn’t as easy when you’re on the receiving end, is it?” I said. </p><p>“No,” she managed to say while she was trying to suppress her voice, when I flicked her ear. “No, sir,” she corrected herself, humiliation burning clear. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said even as I used the crop once more. “I want you to thank me after every caress,” I added. “After all, I’m here, wasting time to educate you.” </p><p>“Of course, sir,” Cornelia answered, her eyes burning with humiliation, especially since she was unable to hide the signs of arousal slipping from her entrance. I stayed silent, but the crop didn’t, exploding on her tight bottom several times, each earning a grudge-filled thank you from Cornelia. </p><p>[+500 Experience] 50% Penalty!</p><p>“Not bad, firecracker,” I said after reaching the two digits. “I wasn’t expecting you to give such a nice performance, maybe there’s hope for you after all.” </p><p>“Thank you, sir,” she said once more, but this time, her words turned into a shocked gasp at the last moment as I caressed her sopping wet entrance. </p><p>“Don’t worry, I’m a good employer,” I explained. “You have worked hard for your reward.” Before Cornelia could say anything, I dragged my finger against her entrance once more, making her gasp in shock, but otherwise staying silent. Not surprising, considering the sexual part of her job definition was obvious from the start, not to mention she was too horny to obviously care. Even more amusingly, she clearly hated her own reaction to being the submissive party in the relationship. </p><p>She was learning, however, because her only reaction was to thank me again when I pulled the towel away, revealing her naked body. “No problem, firecracker,” I said even as I dragged my finger on her spine gently, making her shiver in desire and appreciation. Under a dedicated assault, I would have her gushing like a spring in less than a minute, but as amusing as the idea was, slowly torturing her with pleasure while denying her a climax sounded much better. </p><p>With that idea in mind, one of my hands dragged down until it was on the outside of her thigh, gently massaging her flesh, occasionally slipping inward to give her a boosted dash of pleasure before moving outside once more. While she was busy trying to contain her reactions, I spent a minute enjoying the beautiful sight in front of me, lithe but curvy where it counted, with a great sensitivity that made playing with her really fun. I couldn’t wait until I could put her into a slutty maid uniform, ready for my attention. </p><p>I kept her in the same position for more than half an hour while I played with her body slowly, exploring her treasures while allowing her pleasure to build, but never to a point of allowing her to climax. Watching her getting frazzled even worse than she was when I forced her to become my servant in exchange for my support, though on second thought, it was reasonable. As a noble scion, there was little in life she couldn’t immediately attain, therefore she never faced a situation that she had to delay gratification, making the little edge-play I had been applying extremely effective. </p><p>[+500 Experience] 50% Penalty!</p><p>“Are you enjoying your little reward,” I asked, jolting her out of her frustrated dreams. </p><p>“Yes, sir,” she moaned as I dragged my finger along her entrance, giving her a fresh jolt of pleasure. For the first time, the word sir left her mouth naturally rather than with a grudge. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said even as I dragged my finger over her entrance once more, carefully calibrated to prevent her from climaxing. “I wonder how impressive your climax would have been?” I added absentmindedly. </p><p>Despite her dazed state, she was smart enough to catch my particular usage of words. “Would have been, sir?” she asked, and I was glad to note a huge dash of panic in her tone. </p><p>“Would have been, of course, firecracker,” I said casually even as I slipped my fingers inside her for a moment, just enough to give her a jolt before pulling out and replacing it with a spank. “You can’t seriously think you deserve a big reward after your lackluster performance. You need to really impress me before reaching a climax.” </p><p>“But-” she started, only to be silenced by another spank. “Sorry, sir,” she said reproachfully. “Is there anything I can do to gain enough favor?” she asked, which, more than anything, proved just how weak she was against pleasure, even overwhelming her prickly pride. </p><p>“Hmm,” I said as I dragged my hand over her back, dipping toward the edge of her boobs for a moment, enough to make her shiver. “I wouldn’t be adverse to it if you manage to give me enough pleasure. Do you think you can handle it?” </p><p>“I can handle it, sir,” came the answer, much quicker than I had expected. I took a step back, examining her body, trying to understand whether she was actually that crazy about pleasure, or whether she was trying to lull me into a false sense of security. As I examined her, I could see that she had some kind of ploy in mind, but I didn’t know her exact plan. Still, I felt secure enough to test her. </p><p>“Interesting, let’s see whether it’s just empty talk, or if you’ll be able to handle your commitments,” I said cheerfully as I waved my hand, and the ribbon that kept her hands wrapped disappeared back to her bag. “That’s enough for today. I’m going to visit again tomorrow, right after sunset. I expect you to impress me,” I said as I waved my hand, my clothes flying toward my body. </p><p>“That’s it for today?” she murmured in shock, clearly dissatisfied. “Sir!” she added when I spanked her bottom in warning. </p><p>“Yes, and you’re forbidden to play with yourself, and believe me I will know,” I said as I patted her shoulder, using the opportunity to cast a spell to prevent her from climaxing. It wasn’t impossible to break, but I would know if it was broken. </p><p>I could have easily pushed forward, of course, but I wanted her to truly process what she had signed up for. I wanted her to regain her fire, only to break her once again. </p><p>Playing with her was going to be fun, I thought as I stepped into the main corridor once more…  </p><p><br></p><p>[Level: 16    Experience: 134600 / 136000 </p><p>Strength: 18    Charisma: 25</p><p>Precision: 13    Perception: 14</p><p>Agility: 17     Manipulation: 20</p><p>Speed: 13       Intelligence: 17</p><p>Endurance: 14      Wisdom: 21</p><p>HP: 1200 / 1200    Mana: 1484 / 1552        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>[Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Expert Arcana [75/75]   </p><p>Expert  Elemental [75/75]</p><p>Advanced Subterfuge [50/50]         </p><p>Advanced Biomancy [50/50]        </p><p>Basic Speech [25/25]        ]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p>",

    "content": "<p> My mind was very busy as I walked through the school corridors, trying to analyze the situation I was forced to confront. I knew that I wasn’t the best when it came to assessing the norms outside the school despite my improved capabilities, but even I could confidently state that finding necromancers close to the school was rather unexpected, and the fact that they were willing to ambush three random students without rhyme or reason suggested multiple possibilities, each wilder than the last. Even worse, they had a bone dragon, something well-above their magical prowess to raise, meaning they were a part of something bigger. </p><p>Not a comforting thought. </p><p>Still, when I got close to the kitchen door, I let it slide. There was nothing I could do even if I wanted to do anything. Exploring further was impossible before I got stronger. Only luck allowed us to survive their presence, because we already had an extensive defensive entrenchment when they attacked, which greatly limited the impact of their undead horde, and their complete lack of tactical sense handled the rest. There was no way we could have survived if they had summoned their dragon even a moment earlier. I was good, but not that good. </p><p>Not yet, at least. </p><p>Talking to someone about it was not an option either. Neither I nor the girls had anyone we trusted enough to talk to, and even if the girls had, it was impossible to explain how we were able to defeat a bone dragon without revealing the full extent of my abilities, something I wasn’t willing to do until I was much stronger. Being mysteriously strong was attention-grabbing, but not as much as gaining fifteen levels in less than a month, especially combined with my abnormal stat growth. </p><p>With the decision taken to have no action, for the time being, I focused on my immediate task, namely, slipping inside the kitchen for some extra food. The bag I had taken before was about to be emptied, and more importantly, I was fed up with all those dried fruits and meats, with only stale bread and plain water to accompany it. I needed something more delicious. With that in mind, I walked into the kitchen, silently but proudly walking toward the pantry. Thanks to my improved acting abilities, no one even paid attention to me until I reached the servants responsible for maintaining inventory. </p><p>I stood in front of a burly order man, who looked strong and capable enough to work as a butler for a minor noble family, but he clearly chose to work for Silver Spires instead. “I have a requisition for a wilderness outing,” I murmured even as I passed the list I prepared beforehand, with a genuine-looking stamp at the bottom. It was a decent forgery, not enough to pass a magical examination, of course, but no one was about to assess a kitchen requisition, even if it was rather extensive. </p><p>“Wine, magically-preserved meat, quail eggs, aged cheese…” the man read the list, bored rather than disbelieving. “Who fucking brings top-shelf wine to a hunting expedition,” he murmured grumpily. </p><p>“Noble brats are still brats,” I answered with a shrug, which earned a sardonic laugh. “Count yourself lucky, at least you don’t have to listen to them complaining about the quality of their linen in the middle of the wilderness while we servants struggle to find clean water.” I sighed pointedly, doing my best to copy a mentally-exhausted servant. “Do me a favor and give me some good stuff. I don’t want to be executed because I snapped and beat that snot-nosed brat with a substandard bottle of wine,” I said, earning another laugh. </p><p>“Of course, nothing less for our heroic scions, standing between us and the apocalypse,” he said in faux-worship before turning to enter the pantry. </p><p>“As soon as they figure out how to dress themselves,” I added, and the servant disappeared with one last chuckle. When he returned, he was carrying a large bag along. I took the bag, but left only after a few minutes of gossip. It was nice to know people around me. With the bag, I returned to my room and enjoyed a delicious meal, though I doubted that any other mage would have been understanding when I used my elemental abilities to cook myself a delicious steak, and using arcana to clean up afterward. I didn’t open the wine, however, as I had other plans for it. </p><p>When I left my room, I was once again disguised as a maid, but this time the clothes were just an illusion rather than a full costume. I had a lot of mana, so wasting a few dozen points was nothing. </p><p>My destination was Cornelia’s room. It was not the evening yet, but I wanted to ambush her earlier with my presence, just to make sure she wouldn’t be able to set up a trap. The magical lock on her door didn’t even take a breath to unlock even when I had to circumvent a trap that hadn’t been there during my first visit. My performance last night clearly spooked her, not knowing my display of competence was merely a trick. </p><p>Once I was in the room, I replaced the illusions with a field of invisibility. It wasn’t a true invisibility spell, which was ironically too noticeable magically, but a light trick to make me harder to be seen. Only after that, I cast the second spell, and stepped into Cornelia’s large living room, which was empty. So was her smaller guest room and her bedroom. I wasn’t disappointed, however, because I could hear running water from the bathroom. </p><p>Excellent, I thought as I walked to the bar and took out a nice white wine and two champagne glasses. I wasn’t being stingy about the wines I acquired earlier, but Cornelia clearly had better stuff than what was available through the general kitchen, not to mention taking her bottle without asking for permission was another subtle powerplay. Cornelia was under my power, and I intended to teach her how fun it was to be on the other side of the coin. </p><p>I even got naked before stepping into her bathroom -and removing another magical trap in the process- while doing my best to stay silent, then sneaked inside. I had to hold back myself from whistling in appreciation when I examined the extravagant bath, once again underlining Cornelia’s wealth. But gold-plated taps or silver mirrors barely earned a glance from me, not when I was able to see Cornelia resting in the small pool in the center of the room, her body hidden under a thick layer of bubbles, her eyes closed. </p><p>Cornelia was not someone that would respond to kindness, so, the more impressive my appearance was, the better. So, I cast a weak silencing charm -weak because I didn’t want to alert her with a mana flare- before walking toward the pool, and slid into the water, all without managing to alert her. “How have you been since our last meeting, little lady,” I suddenly said as I opened the wine bottle, yet I also infused the water with mana to react quickly to the inevitable violent reaction. </p><p>She didn’t disappoint. Her eyes popped open in shock, and a wave of flame came targeting me just as quick. However, it took just a flicker of my fingers to extinguish it. It wasn’t even an issue of strength, as her hurried spell had a weak internal structure, easy to puncture with a stab of water, destabilizing it so that it faded halfway through. </p><p>Cornelia looked at me shocked, though it was understandable. After all, despite the weakness of her initial spell, it wasn’t something a regular elemental mage could achieve. It required a strong analytical capability, and was only possible thanks to my extreme stats and high arcana capabilities. </p><p>“So rude,” I said with a mocking smirk. “I would have expected more from the noble heiress of House Antony. No wonder your uncle is looking for a better alternative.” </p><p>“Shut up,” Cornelia shouted even as she raised her hand, which was glowing dangerously with swirling flames. I didn’t react to her threat. Not because her magical ability was to be underestimated, but because despite her explosive anger, she was smart enough to understand what was at stake. </p><p>If she hadn’t exploded in anger after I took the virginity of her girlfriend in front of her, an offhanded insult wouldn’t trigger her as well. </p><p>I slowly poured wine into the glasses and sent one to her, ignoring the threat. After a moment, the fire around Cornelia’s hand dispelled, leaving frustration in its place. “What do you want?” </p><p>I took a lingering sip from the glass instead of answering immediately, just another trick to drive home my superior position. It was a nice feeling to feel superior to Cornelia, the scary noble heiress that even the teachers failed to intimidate. “Delicious wine,” I commented casually. </p><p>“What do you want?” Cornelia repeated, angrier. </p><p>“Come on, sweetie. Let’s not act like brutes. Enjoy your wine first, we can always talk business later,” I answered, my laziness making her even angrier, which made her just more frustrated because she was not used to keeping her anger contained. </p><p>“Give me your glass, then,” Cornelia said with a sudden expression of enlightenment, doubting there was an underhanded trick on the glass. Not an unreasonable one, though considering how easily I had penetrated her domicile, rather unnecessary as well. </p><p>“As you wish,” I said, but upon seeing her smug expression, I decided to pull a little trick. A small application of  biomancy later, the wine glass was contaminated with an effective aphrodisiac, enough to make the situation even more uncomfortable for her, the mana flare being \tmasked by the levitation spell I cast to send it to her. A moment later, the other floated toward me. “A delicious vintage,” I commented. </p><p>“It’s from one of our wineries. It’s a decent year,” Cornelia answered, who used the small break to exchange the glasses to gather her composure. </p><p>“I appreciate beautiful things,” I answered while keeping my gaze on her face, my smirk widening as Cornelia frowned. She fell silent, and I didn’t bother to break the silence, enjoying the bath and the wine at the same time. Cornelia drank slowly as well, but from the distracted expression on her face, it was clear that she was trying to get a handle of the situation. Understandable, considering how much she enjoyed being in control. It was ironic that she was losing control of every aspect of her life, the control of her family due to her uncle, the control of her development due to her level cap…</p><p>And the control of her personal relationship thanks to my presence… </p><p>For the next few minutes, I asked her several questions, none of them related to her problems, which clearly annoyed her. Then, I decided to push the envelope once more. “So, do you still attend classes after the latest development?” I asked. </p><p>Considering her attitude and her situation, I wasn’t surprised when her hands started trembling, preluding an explosion of anger. Still, she impressed me by somehow preventing herself from exploding. “I still go to some of them,” she answered between her squeezed teeth. </p><p>“Good idea, every little bit helps in your condition,” I answered. </p><p>My dismissive attitude finally managed to trigger her. “Shut up!” she exclaimed even as she jumped to her feet and threw the glass toward me, which missed my face by inches, but I didn’t even flinch. I might have annoyed her with my inaction, but since it displayed her beautiful breasts in front of me, I didn’t react too badly. </p><p>[+50 Experience] 50% Penalty!  </p><p>“Such a bad attitude,” I answered, ignoring her poor assault attempt in favor of shaking my head in disapproval. “It’s no wonder your uncle wants to keep you away from ruling the house.” </p><p>“You’re playing a dangerous game,” she exclaimed even as two thick coils of flame appeared around her arm, twisting and turning dangerously in a poor attempt of intimidation. Poor, because it wasn’t even about the power difference. She was a fire mage currently submerged in water, and I had already shown my water elemental abilities. </p><p>I didn’t bother to stop her assault, even crossed my arm to signal just how little her display had affected me. Her answer was to increase the intensity of the flames, colorful shadows dancing on the marble walls. “Calm your tits, firecracker,” I said before letting my gaze slide pointedly to her chest. “Not your actual ones, of course. I’m very happy with their virility.” </p><p>My dismissive attitude was enough to dispel her childish display. She dispelled her flames and sat down, the bubbles hiding her body once more. “What do you need?” she asked in a more subdued tone. </p><p>“I only need a few things, but I want a lot of things,” I answered. “However, the real question is, what do you need, and what are you willing to part with?” </p><p>Cornelia scowled. “You know that. I need to find a way to break through the level cap.”  </p><p>I smiled softly. “No, that’s not true. What you need is to protect yourself against your uncle and to take the reins of the family. Improving your personal strength is not the only way.” </p><p>“You told me that you can help me on the level cap!” she exclaimed, anger and disappointment warring on her face even as she raised her hand once more, yet again covered with flames. Her tantrums were getting very stale. “You lied!” </p><p>“No, I haven’t,” I said calmly. “I have ways to circumvent the situation to increase your personal power, but as you can guess, they are neither easy to find nor easy to implement. I need to trust you a lot more before I actually teach you how,” I said, bluffing shamelessly. I didn’t know whether the companion system would help the situation, and I didn’t even know that I would be able to trigger it with Cornelia, but since she was my only reasonable source of experience, I was willing to take the risk. </p><p>“What do you want in return?” Cornelia asked, excited. </p><p>“A lot,” I answered without missing a beat. “However, you don’t need to worry about it for now, because it’s a bit early to actually offer that. I have a more reasonable deal in mind.” </p><p>“You’re playing a dangerous game, revealing the secret but promising to withhold it. Aren’t you worried that I would reveal your secrets?” </p><p>“Not really,” I answered casually, which, for once, was actually accurate. I still didn’t want to reveal myself to the wider public, but it was no longer a deadly secret. Moreover, I trusted Cornelia to act true to herself and be a self-serving bitch. She knew only two things about me, that I was apparently much stronger than I had revealed, and I claimed to have secrets of circumventing the level cap. The first part made it a gamble to reveal my secrets, as she had no idea how strong I actually was. For the second part, she only had my words for the moment with no evidence to back it up. She would have been laughed at by everyone if she went to anyone else with it. The only reason she was listening to it at all was her desperation. </p><p>The despondent silence that filled the room indicated that she understood my point of view without an explanation. “What do you have in mind if you’re not going to help me increase my power?” she asked. </p><p>“I’m going to support you against your uncle, of course,” I said. </p><p>“Why would you do that?” she said in shock. “Training me in secret is one thing, but if you do that, you would be challenging the acting head of House Antony. Since I’m the rightful heir, there’s not much he can do against me, but it’s not the same for you. He would send an endless number of assassins the moment he discovered your support.” She took a deep breath before continuing, her tone bitter. “You read my letters, you know that he already removed or converted most of my supporters. I can’t prevent him from targeting you.” </p><p>“I know,” I said, though I wasn’t really worried. Yes, House Antony was strong, but even for them, Silver Spires was not easy to penetrate. I doubted that they would risk a lot of their power, and considering I might gain a few more levels until my involvement was discovered, I wasn’t afraid of anyone below level twenty-five. House Antony was strong, but definitely not enough to risk losing such a strong warrior while trying to penetrate Silver Spires, risking their ire. </p><p>“Then why? You could have gone to my uncle with those letters and revealed my condition. He would have rewarded you greatly.” </p><p>“No, he would have given me a few shiny trinkets and a few empty titles. However, if I manage to put you on top…” I dragged, leaving the rewards implied. “You can’t win big by playing safe.”  </p><p>“Then, what do you have in mind to help me?” Cornelia said, much more interested. </p><p>“Simple,” I said. “Your biggest challenge is to hide your stagnation from your uncle, while his biggest objective is to understand how strong you have become. By the way, why is that?” I asked, curious. Her letters mentioned the status, but didn’t go into detail about the reasons. </p><p>“I have six months until my uncle can challenge me for the ruling seat, but since it’s a life-and-death challenge, he will only do that if he’s sure of his victory,” she explained. </p><p>“Do you know how strong he is?” I answered. </p><p>“I’m not completely sure, but he’s likely just below twenty, but definitely stronger than I currently am, not to mention he has access to a lot of magical weapons and treasures,” Cornelia explained. Seeing me nodding without alarm, Cornelia relaxed a bit more. Her thought process was clear. Since I was calm on the prospect of facing a well-armed family head bordering level twenty, I must have been quite strong, which was accurate. If forced, I would have taken that bet, especially if I had Aviada’s sword in hand. “So, that’s my situation. What do you want in return?” she asked. </p><p>“I want you to be my maid,” I answered. Just like that, Cornelia was on her feet once more, flames covering her arm. But this time, she clearly intended to attack.</p><p>Things were getting interesting…  </p><p><br></p><p>[Level: 16    Experience: 133100 / 136000 </p><p>Strength: 18    Charisma: 25</p><p>Precision: 13    Perception: 14</p><p>Agility: 17     Manipulation: 20</p><p>Speed: 13       Intelligence: 17</p><p>Endurance: 14      Wisdom: 21</p><p>HP: 1200 / 1200    Mana: 1484 / 1552        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>[Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Expert Arcana [75/75]   </p><p>Expert  Elemental [75/75]</p><p>Advanced Subterfuge [50/50]         </p><p>Advanced Biomancy [50/50]        </p><p>Basic Speech [25/25]        ]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p>",

    "content": "<p>The drive back to the house was challenging with my boner refusing to go down. Understandable, considering the way the shoot had turned out with Penny, stopping just when things were about to get fun. But despite the discomfort, a smile was on my face. After all, I managed to find the best gift any director or photographer could find, a sexy Midwesterner desperate for fame and too skittish to enforce boundaries. </p><p>All that remained was to have another session, and she would be putty in my hands. </p><p>As I drove, I checked the hidden cameras I had placed in the house, hoping to find one of the girls there to help me with my problem. Unfortunately, the house was empty, meaning I needed to rely on a suboptimal solution to take care of my boner. </p><p>Just as I was feeling the desperation, the solution showed itself as I pulled to the driveway. Nicole had leaned over the trunk of her car, trying to grab several large shopping bags simultaneously. The move accentuated her amazing hips even when she was dressed in a pair of loose sweatpants. I didn’t have a problem with her dressing like that while in public. She was too weak against suggestions, and I wouldn’t appreciate a competitor for her interests. </p><p>“Hey, Nicole, how’s it going?” I said even as I appeared next to her, amused by the way she flinched when I gently caressed her hand when I grabbed the bags from her hand. Not surprising, considering how our latest encounter had developed. </p><p>“No need to tire yourself, Stephen, I can handle it,” she murmured panickedly, clearly hoping to maintain the distance between us while we were still in public. </p><p>I wanted to punish her for that act. However, as much as I would have liked to bend her down take her on the driveway, where any neighbor would get an eyeful of her sexy skin, doing something like that would be counterproductive. Not because I cared about suburban gossip, but because one of them might snap a photo. Nicole was turning to be a really nice model, but a scandalous video on the web would be enough to ruin her career, and my best source of income with it. “It’s not a bother at all,” I answered, but patted her ass playfully even as I did so, earning a nice gasp as a result. </p><p>With her shyness, it wasn’t shocking for her to dash toward the door with the remaining bags, once again providing me with a generous show of her amazing booty despite her loose clothing. I walked behind her slowly. After all, we were going to be alone in the house, and I had all the intentions of leveraging the opportunity to the limit. </p><p>When I entered, Nicole was already in the kitchen, placing the groceries in the fridge. “Thanks, Stephen, I can handle the rest,” she said rapidly as she grabbed my bags. </p><p>“No worries, I can help,” I said, my smirk leaving no doubt about what I had in mind. I continued just as she opened her mouth to argue. “I insist,” I added in a throaty tone I only used when I was pushing for a passionate embrace. I was happy to see her trembling in desire, the memories of our last encounter still fresh in her mind. Helpless, she nodded and grabbed the item I had passed her, managing not to pull back when our fingers touched. </p><p>“Thanks,” she murmured as she turned her back to hide the sudden expression of desire that appeared on her face, but not fast enough to hide the glimpse from me. There was nothing preventing me from pushing her down and taking her on the kitchen floor, except the desire to see her act skittishly while trying to deny her own arousal. I continue to help her empty the bags, making sure to share several accidental touches to keep her arousal alive. </p><p>First, it was just my fingers touching the back of her hand, but soon, my fingers started to caress upward alongside the back of her hand suggestively whenever she grabbed another item, slowly building up her frustration. Soon, I let my body to rub against her, enjoying her soft curves. Her loose t-shirt and sweatpants worked wonders in hiding her amazing figure, but the same couldn’t be said for isolating her from my touch. Their thin, worn-out fabric might as not exist in our ‘accidental’ collusions, reminding me the last time she ended up on my lap, her amazing curves against my muscles. </p><p>She seemed to think of the same thing, because when I pushed her against the shelves with the excuse of putting a box of cereal to the top shelf, she made no attempt to pull back. She even shuffled until my shaft was nicely lodged in her crack. Things were about to get interesting… After putting the cereal to the shelf, I let my hands drift down, browsing her curves until they landed on her waist. </p><p>“Stephen, not here,” she gasped even as I pulled her hips back, making the presence of my shaft even more clear. </p><p>“Why, we’re alone?” I answered nonchalantly while I started grinding against her ass, my hands slipping under her t-shirt, gently caressing her stomach before moving upward, preparing to grab her breasts. Despite her protest, her heartbeat rose to match her panicked breathing, her hips moving in the same rhythm. Things were about to get interesting… </p><p>Then the front door opened without a warning, and Katie entered. </p><p>I instantly took a step back, leaving Nicole alone and panting against the shelves. She had an expression of total shock on her face, one that loudly shouted the world that she had been caught doing something extremely inappropriate. So, it was her luck when Katie saw me first, and instantly turned her head with an onset of shyness, unintentionally giving Nicole enough time to gather herself. </p><p>“Hi mom, hi Stephen,” Katie exclaimed a bit louder than necessary, but Nicole was too busy with her own concerns to take note of Katie’s exaggerated excitement. I used the opportunity to examine Katie’s clothing. She was wearing a loose blouse and a knee-length skirt, she was still very nerdy. I really needed to bring her shopping one day. </p><p>Katie’s sudden appearance forced me to change my plans a bit. There were two reasonable options in front of me, convincing Katie to leave the room, or leaving Nicole alone for the moment. The victorious gaze that Nicole sent to me told the same thing, but she suddenly blanched when she noticed my widening smirk. “So, how was your day,” I asked Katie even as I took a step closer to Nicole, and my hand landed on her bottom, unafraid of being noticed because the kitchen counter was sufficiently raised to hide me from the view. </p><p>Nicole flinched as my fingers dug deep into her booty, but Katie missed than in the mixture of excitement and shyness that was borne from getting my attention. Her already impressive crush for me had turned monumental after the last lesson that went out of control, though with a correspondingly enhanced shyness. “My day was good, especially the math class,” Katie started hesitantly, but when I nodded with an exaggerated display of interest, she started talking much more rapidly, nodding even as she spoke. </p><p>I couldn’t care less about the ridiculous argument she had with her history teacher, but her distracted chatter was the exact thing I needed to pressure Nicole, whose eyes begged to me, but only to be ignored. It was risky, but I was too horny to actually pay attention to such a thing. However, Nicole’s apparent obedience was even more amusing, choosing to stay in a place where I could easily molest her rather than stepping away. </p><p>Luckily, rather than walking close, Katie chose to lean against the dining table, giving me space to really cut loose. Under Nicole’s incredulous gaze, I pulled down my zipper, revealing my raging erection. Despite her shock, however, she reached and wrapped her hand around my girth before I could even ask her to. </p><p>“Really, how can your teacher ignore your contributions like that?” I said to Katie even as I tugged Nicole’s sweatpants, pulling it down to reveal her panties, curious about what she was wearing underneath. On that, Nicole managed to surprise me. Instead of wearing a white boring piece that would fit her sweatpants, she was wearing a tiny crimson piece, one of my gifts.  </p><p>“Mom, are you okay?” Katie said when Nicole gasped in shock. </p><p>“Nothing important, honey. I hit my toe to the corner,” Nicole explained, and I decided to help her play the lingering pain. My hand sneaked down until it landed on her entrance, the thin fabric of her courageous panties doing little to reduce the impact as my fingers danced at her entrance. Nicole pulled her hand away from my shaft, and for a moment, I thought that she was about to retreat. Instead, she grabbed the nearest bowl and a spoon, and started to squash some bananas, the perfect excuse to keep her head lowered, hiding her blush from Katie. </p><p>Nicole’s explanation was enough for Katie, who was doing her best to keep my attention on her, something I had no problem providing even as I continued to finger Nicole. I was rather good at multitasking. </p><p>Soon, I decided to make things even more interesting, and used my free hand to reach to my phone, and send a quick message to Katie. ‘Send me a sexy picture,’ I wrote. </p><p>Katie frowned a bit when her phone buzzed, an expression that was replaced by confusion when she saw the sender, which then turned into a thick blush when she read its contents. She was lucky that Nicole had bigger problems to pay attention. ‘Now?’ she wrote back in response, and I just nodded. </p><p>She stood up, turning toward the stairs, but I rapidly sent another text to her. ‘Stay here,’ it said. </p><p>The expression of shock on her face reached an unbelievable level, and for a moment, I was afraid that I had pushed my hand too much. However, when she turned her eyes toward Nicole, examining her carefully rather than leaving the room, I revised that opinion, especially when Katie turned her back but her hand reached upward, playing with the buttons of her blouse. Then she surreptitiously raised her phone and took a quick snap. When my phone buzzed once more, I angled it appropriately to avoid Nicole’s gaze even if she decided to raise her head. ‘Not a bad start,’ I wrote. </p><p>Katie buttoned her blouse once more before turning to face me, though I was happy to note that she left the top two buttons free, creating a nice cleavage. She sent a worried glance at Nicole. I decided that it was the time to kill two birds at one stone. I reached for the bowl Nicole was busy with like I was about to dip my finger, but at the last moment, twitched my finger, sending the bowl on the floor. “Ups. Sorry Nicole, so clumsy,” I murmured, not bothering to look sincere. They looked at me, and I just nodded downward. For Katie, it was a signal saying everything was under control, however, for Nicole, it had a different meaning, especially when I dragged my stained finger along my shaft, indicating my desires. </p><p>“Don’t worry, I’ll clean it up,” Nicole said instantly, and grabbed a pile of paper towel before falling to her knees. I moved back slightly, just giving Nicole just enough space to squeeze between the counter and my body, and gave thumbs up to Katie, who was shocked at my daring. </p><p>‘I’ll warn you when she’s about to finish,’ I said to her, gesturing her to unbutton her blouse once more. Her face reddened enough to contrast greatly with her beautiful hair, but still, no matter how hesitant, she followed my direction. Meanwhile, a familiar warmth enveloped my shaft, creeping up slowly as Nicole did her best to devour it without making a sound to alert Katie. </p><p>Meanwhile, Katie received another message from me. ‘Remove the bra,’ it read, pushing Katie’s blush to an unbelievable level. Her head dipped down to the counter, clearly afraid of being caught by Nicole, but a nod from me proved enough to bolster her courage. “So, what happened next with your history project?” I asked, indicating her to continue talking to avoid Nicole’s suspicion. </p><p>Katie nodded and continued her tale, though since she had more important issues, her story lost any sense of cohesion. Luckily, Nicole was not in a position to pay attention to that. Meanwhile, Katie reached to her back, and a bit of fumbling later, her modest bra came off, revealing her slender body to my eyes. This time, I raised my phone and acted like I took a picture of her while I actually started recording video. </p><p>Katie put her arms around her chest for a moment. I lowered my phone down to reestablish eye contact, though Katie wasn’t aware of my other objective, namely, recording Nicole as she tried to devour my shaft in front of her daughter. It was turning out to be an amazing video. Pity that I couldn’t share it with anyone else. I leaned forward to warn Katie, which had the added benefit of locking Nicole against the counter and pushing my shaft deeper into her throat. Despite her best efforts, a gag escaped Nicole’s mouth. Luckily, Katie was too distracted by her own ordeal to catch it. </p><p>‘Play with your breasts,’ I said in another message. This time, Katie followed my order immediately. I held the phone with one hand, recording Katie while I crouched enough to put my elbow on the counter, then my other hand dipped down and grabbed Nicole’s breasts over the t-shirt, discovering that her bra was just as fragile as her panties. I sank my fingers deep while I sent another message to Katie, this time asking her to remove her panties. </p><p>She mouthed a silent complaint in panic, but I just looked at her disappointingly. “Are you sure you have done your best to impress your teacher in your project,” I said, disguising my argument as a pointless comment to her senseless story to avoid Nicole’s attention. My comment didn’t work well in the flow of the story, but luckily, Nicole had many more important things to pay attention to. </p><p>Katie still looked resistant, so I sent a string of frowns, replicating my own expression. Maintaining that frown might have been the hardest thing I had ever attempted in my life. It was hard to fake unhappiness while receiving a blowjob from a voluptuous brunette while simultaneously receiving a reluctant striptease from a barely legal nerdy beauty. Still, I somehow managed to fake it enough to convince said nerdy beauty, because her hands disappeared under her skirt, riding it up to reveal her thin yet shapely legs. </p><p>Her story paused when her fingers hooked around her panties and pulled them slowly, her skirt immediately falling down to hide the treasure underneath. “Excellent,” I said as I turned my attention to Katie. At the same time, I wrote her another message. ‘I’m impressed.” Then, I sent another message. ‘That’s enough excitement for a day, you can go to your room. Or if you want to have another lesson, you can go to the basement and wait for me there,’ it said. She looked at the screen in conflict, making me curious about which one it would prefer. I watched her as she stuffed her underwear to her bag before reaching for her blouse, but another message arrived at that moment. ‘One last thing, remove the rest of your clothes before you reach the stairs, I want you to be naked at the end of whichever stairs you prefer,’ said the message.  </p><p>It was a stretch goal, but I was happy when Katie just nodded obediently and pulled her blouse over her head before she started walking. She tried to wink at me suggestively, but her shyness prevented her from reflecting the gravitas that the move deserved. Still, it assisted Nicole’s lips greatly in their task of bringing me to climax. Katie walked away, doing her best to add a sexy sway to her hips, but her lack of experience was clear. </p><p>Soon, I had to lean forward exaggeratedly to see Katie, which, of course, pushed my shaft even deeper to Nicole, who failed to keep her gags under control. Katie wasn’t far away enough to miss it, but she had many more important things to focus on. I lost the sight of Katie when she reached the stairs, but not before she slipped out of the skirt and revealed her cute bottom to my sight. ‘Send a selfie from the top of the stairs,’ I said before turning my attention back to Nicole, grabbing her head with both hands and started impaling her mercilessly. </p><p>The buzzing of the phone, revealing a completely naked Katie sitting at the end of the stairs that led to my basement, her legs crossed in an attempt to look self-confident gave me an irresistible push toward the climax, and I filled Nicole’s mouth with my seed. After the long denial, it resembled a new spring, filling Nicole’s unprepared mouth completely before spilling out, staining her shirt. She looked at me, begging, though I didn’t know whether she was asking me to stop or to bring her to her bedroom before we continue. </p><p>Regardless, the answer was negative… </p>",

    "content": "<p>The shock on Tanya’s face was exquisite as I greeted her. “Good afternoon, S-sir,” she stammered, doing her best to remove the shock from her face. I was lucky that Jenny was too fascinated by the first-class cabin to notice Tanya’s shifting expression. </p><p>“Come on, call me Nathan,” I said with a smirk that wasn’t exactly nice. “We are not strangers anymore, are we?” I added even as I took a suggestive step forward, which worked for two purposes, unsettling Tanya and blocking Jenny’s view. Not that I was worried about Jenny identifying the real source of her nervousness. Even if it wasn’t for the distraction, Jenny was too straightforward and trusting to get the subtext. After all, we were talking about a girl that spent years with Natalie without getting suspicious. The fact that she failed to pick up the changes during the last three months was just another factor, as I lost the count how many times I had been fucking Natalie while Jenny was on the phone. </p><p>Her lack of attention wasn’t an excuse to get sloppy, of course. Overconfidence was the leading reason for getting caught. A little vigilance never hurt.  </p><p>“Of course, N-Nathan,” Tanya answered, still stammering, but after taking a deep breath, she was much calmer. “Let me show you your seats,” she continued, much calmer while repeating the empty platitudes she learned during the training, though I noted that she disappeared as soon as she took our drink orders -mango juice for Jenny, and after a disappointing glare for her, my bourbon was switched to orange juice as well. </p><p>I could have stuck to my guns, but a glass of smoky alcohol wasn’t worth annoying the smoking hot redhead next to me, especially after I had spent the last two hours bringing her into the right mood. </p><p>“I’m not going to suffer alone,” she said with a wide smirk as she leaned back the comfortable chair, not paying attention to Tanya’s departure. “If I can’t drink, you can’t either.” </p><p>“Whatever you want, sweetie,” I answered as I patted her thigh, bare thanks to her tiny shorts. I received a glare when, instead of pulling it away, I let my hand linger on. However, it was a playful glare, so it failed to deter me from my determined climb. </p><p>“We’re in public,” she whispered, panicked and excited at the same time as she grabbed my wrist, but made no attempt to actually push it away. At least, until she heard the footsteps approaching from behind, signaling Tanya’s arrival. There, she started pushing away, but I made sure to linger my touch despite her growing panic until Tanya appeared next to us, leaving Jenny in a lurch. “Thanks,” Jenny said loudly, almost shouting, as she grabbed her glass of juice and took a large sip, more to hide her expression to quench her thirst. </p><p>It was good, because it made her miss the sudden shift in Tanya’s expression. Tanya’s gaze danced between us, drifting down to my crotch and the obvious bulge there for a moment before sliding away, no doubt having flashbacks about our last encounter. And she was too earnest to be able to hide the sudden onset of desire that popped into her mind. Understandable, after all, her unwillingness had evaporated rather easily during our previous encounter. </p><p>Regardless of the circumstances, I took pride in leaving a woman completely satisfied. </p><p>“Thanks, sweetie,” I murmured then I took a sip, only to meet with a much sharper taste than one normally found in a juice. She was such a thoughtful girl. I needed to find a way to reward her. </p><p>I put my hand on Jenny’s thigh immediately after Tanya’s departure. “You’re a thug,” Jenny said, but the gasp in her tone told a different story. Emboldened by that, my fingers once again found her inner thigh, and started to climb upward. “We can’t do that in here,” she murmured, once again grabbing my wrist with absolutely no intention of pushing it away.</p><p>“Do you want to bet?” I asked even as I pushed my fingers forward, dancing at the edge of her shorts, all it would take was a gentle push to get rid of the remaining barrier. Her breathing quickened even further, and I smirked in satisfaction. My fingers danced at the edge, making her joy battle against desire. “But maybe you’re right, it’s too much in public,” I added as I pulled my hands away without a warning. </p><p>“Really?” she said, disappointment clear in her tone. She was about to question more, but upon seeing my smirk, she chose to prematurely end her sentence with a harumph. Her eyes burned with playful anger, her lips still parted due to an unmet desire that compounded thanks to the massage in the airport, leaving her body aching for more. </p><p>The overdrive of libido she was suffering as a part of her pregnancy didn’t help either. </p><p>“Oh, yes. It would be rude to force you something you’re uncomfortable with,” I said, once again uttering a lie without the slightest hesitation, something Jenny was very much aware after the month she had suffered under my soft yet insistent pressuring to seduce her for some fun times without her girlfriend. </p><p>“No doubt,” Jenny said in a playful tone, though I managed to catch the edge of frustration on her tone despite her best effort to keep it away from the surface. She turned her attention toward the wide screen that held a lot of pictures, so I opened a movie as well, but rather than picking one of the movies from the list, I plugged a USB drive and opened a movie that I brought my own. It was a recent movie, about a torrent love affair, rather controversial due to its passionate lovemaking scenes, enough to result in the divorce of the lead actors involved. </p><p>Jenny looked at me when the movie started, even its opening scene enough to almost classify as softcore pornography. “Are you sure you can watch it here?” she asked in shock. </p><p>“Honey, we’re in the first class, I would like them actually making a scene over it,” I answered. It wasn’t entirely accurate, as a normal flight it would have received a stern warning. This one was exceptional, as first-class was empty other than two of us, and more importantly, our only stewardess didn’t have the option to complain considering the things she had been doing during our last shared flight — of course with my assistance.  </p><p>Jenny said nothing else, so I put my headphones on and leaned back, not reacting to Jenny’s gaze slipping toward my screen repeatedly, especially when her legs started to rub against each other repeatedly. Her expression was awkward when Tanya came with her trays, bringing us our starters. Tanya was no less awkward, stuttering as she explained our dishes. </p><p>For me, it was a challenge to keep my smirk from becoming too obvious between two blushing girls, one redhead and one blonde. </p><p>“I need to visit the bathroom,” Jenny murmured a couple of minutes after she finished her starter. She was restless, but I was familiar enough with her demeanor to know that it was not discomfort but her desire overwhelming her reason, which gave me a really good idea about what she was planning to do in the bathroom. The way her hips swayed as she walked away just confirmed my assumption. </p><p>Under other circumstances, I would have followed her to the bathroom to assist her, but the blonde beauty peeking from the corner, waiting for Jenny to disappear went a long way to convince me. The moment Jenny closed her door Tanya dashed toward me, a panicked expression on her face. “Sir, please, you need to close that movie. It’ll be a big problem if someone sees it,” she rapidly explained. She leaned forward as she tried to make eye contact, making me curious about the resulting cleavage intentional or accidental. </p><p>“Really, but I feel randy, and my partner is not feeling like helping me, unlike the last time. I can’t suffer an uncomfortable flight in the first class,” I countered in an exaggerated clueless attitude. </p><p>A few expressions danced on Tanya’s face. Shame and desire as she clearly experienced a flashback about the last time, where she had been seduced by Natalie before mercilessly abandoned to my hands, which ended up her revealing some of her past secrets, and the loss of her anal virginity. There was even a dash of anger in her expression, but her submissive personality wasn’t able to sustain it for more than a moment. She continued to look at my eyes, using one of the best puppy-eyed expressions I had seen in my life. </p><p>Unfortunately for her, it only made me hornier. She kept the gaze almost a minute, hoping for mercy that was clearly not coming until a resigned sigh left her mouth, and I smirked. “I’ll help you,” she said as she grabbed my hand, and made a motion to stand up, only to fail to drag me up. </p><p>“I’m very comfortable here,” I said to her when she turned at me questioningly, but the shock only appeared when I pulled her hand to my zipper, signaling her about my idea. </p><p>“We can’t!” she gasped in shock, but her weak attempt to pull back was abandoned quickly when she realized I had no intention of letting her go. “What if we get caught, it’ll be a disaster,” she answered. </p><p>“You’re the only stewardess here, and Jenny will stay inside for a while, so it’s not likely. But if you’re worried, don’t forget that sooner you start, less likely for us to get caught,” I answered as I kept her under my sharp gaze, waiting for her surrender. While she struggled with the answer, I let my gaze dance over her body, which shaped perfectly with just the right amount of curves, tempered in her days as a ballerina, then a stripper. </p><p>This time, it took only a few seconds for her will to dissipate, and she fell on her knees. A pull and a brief struggle later, she freed my shaft, her fingers wrapped around the bottom while her lips capturing the crown in her hotness. A gasp escaped my mouth as the pleasure enveloped my poor shaft, which had been suffering helplessly for the last few hours. The fact that Tanya kept looking up in a panicked manner just added more to the situation. </p><p>Under other circumstances, I would have done my best to keep myself contained to stretch the situation, but the current circumstances were a bit different. As much as I trusted myself to handle Jenny’s reaction, it wasn’t ideal; and the fear of getting caught just increased my pleasure further. To quicken the situation even further, I quickly unbuttoned her shirt despite her weak imitation of a protest. When I saw her wearing a boring functional bra, I pulled it off as well, which made her try to pull away, but I was quick enough to push her down, aborting her attempt. </p><p>I couldn’t help but feel proud of my achievement. Mile high club was not really an achievement for anything other than teenagers or boring married couples when it was done hidden behind a door, but there was something delicious in doing that in the middle of the first-class cabin, where someone just walked in to catch the amazing sight. Tanya started to move faster as her panic increased, but fear brought excitement along. </p><p>“Does this remind you of your stripping days?” I said even as I caressed her amazing breasts. “Have you ever been naked in the middle of a comfortable private room where you fallen to your knees, putting your lips to work, hoping for a big tip, dreaming a time where the client takes the opportunity to do more than you ever wanted to allow?” I continued, despite knowing the answer. She shook her head negatively, confirming my guess. She was beautiful, but her technique was too horrible for her to give additional services on the side. She clearly worked in a clean club and only for a while until she got her job as a stewardess. </p><p>It was ironic that she ended up doing it as a stewardess. </p><p>Since she was such an obedient and adorable little slut, I decided to push forward a bit more. I leaned forward and pulled her plied skirt up, then made a noise of dissatisfaction. “Those are ugly, get rid of them,” I ordered even as I pushed her panties down a bit, revealing the most intimate part of her body, which was perfectly bare to reveal her amazing shape. She managed to remove it without ever stopping her service. “Good girl,” I muttered even as I patted her head, enjoying the way she shivered. It was miracle for such a little submissive doll to be this inexperienced, but I was happy to take it as a win. </p><p>Tanya was shivering, fear and excitement overwhelming her because she was very aware that there was no way to explain her situation. After all, she might pull back and stuff my shaft back to my pants, but her lack of underwear and naked breasts were much harder to fix in a moment’s notice. </p><p>Those shivers turned into a fearful tremble when the bathroom door opened. Tanya’s position didn’t allow for her to see Jenny stepping out, but her presence was clear. The only positive was the seat blocked Jenny’s sight as well, making her unaware of the sexy blonde crouched in front of me. Tanya tried to pull away, but my hands were clamped on her head, preventing her from pulling back. I even skewered her deeper, counting on the background noise to cover her gagging sound. </p><p>I was close to a climax, and I would be damned if I let Jenny’s inconvenient appearance to stop me. </p><p>“You took a long while there, what were you doing?” I said to Jenny with a suggestive smirk, which was rather easy emotion to reflect under the circumstances. </p><p>“How rude to ask a lady that?” Jenny answered immediately, but I knew her too well to fall to that trick. </p><p>“Not when I knew what you did there,” I countered, which made Jenny stop, with a full-blown blush invading her face, rivaling her hair color. </p><p>“You’re bluffing,” she said in a tone she clearly assumed as confident, but it was more telling than a barely-legal teenager caught with alcohol for the first time. </p><p>“I’m not,” I answered as I let my gaze linger down on her body, devouring the amazing sight of her body which even her pregnancy failed to ruin, which, with the assistance of the blonde that was suffering through a forceful deepthroat, had pushed me very close to climax. Unfortunately, Jenny took another step forward, threatening to ruin the plan, so I continued. “You would have known if you checked the mirror more carefully,” I answered, which was enough for Jenny to dash back. And since there wasn’t anything, it meant that I had a couple of minutes while she searched for the imaginary clue that revealed her little sneaky masturbation adventure. </p><p>“I’m about to explode,” I warned Tanya the moment the door was closed and pulled it out of her mouth, letting her breathe for a moment. “Be careful to catch all of it, you don’t want to ruin your uniform,” I reminded her even as my shaft twitched. </p><p>Watching another wave of panic invading her mouth as she leaned forward in a panic to catch the flow before it started was almost as good as the wave of pleasure that invaded my body, forcing me to explode. Tanya was barely able to press her lips at my shaft before the flood started, quickly filling her mouth before starting to slip, threatening to ruin her clothes. I decided to take mercy on her and quickly grabbed the closest fabric, her panties, and passed it to her, which she pressed against my shaft immediately, letting it soak. Only after I finished cumming, she realized what she had used for the task. </p><p>“Put them back on,” I ordered, which somehow achieved the impossible and made her blush even more. “Do you want to get caught,” I reminded her, pointing at her sopping wet entrance, dripping down her legs. </p><p>“Oh, no,” she gasped, and in that panic, she quickly put them on. But when she reached for the bra, I was quicker than her and swiped it off. </p><p>“Quick with your blouse,” I warned, reminding her that she was still racing against the clock, so she quickly buttoned them, which barely helped with her hardened nipples. Lucky for her, she had her jacket to help her cover to avoid the attention of the rest of the staff. After she finished fixing her outfit, she stepped on the isle and dashed away, but not before receiving a rather sharp slap to her bottom. Also, since she made such a nice sacrifice asking me to stop watching the movie, I pulled out my USB stick. </p><p>It was just in time, because Jenny stepped out of the bathroom just as Tanya disappeared along the corner. “You asshole,” Jenny said as she walked quickly to my side. “There was nothing.” </p><p>I smirked. “It made you go back to look, which proved I was right all along,” I answered. Jenny still shook her head negatively before taking her seat, trying to stick to her story, thinking that I had no way to prove. She was wrong. I put my hand on her thigh once more, but this time, didn’t lose a moment before pulling her shorts to the side and dipped into her wetness. “Are you going to claim that you’re this wet naturally,” I whispered into her ear as I leaned forward, using the opportunity to leave a little kiss on her sensitive neck as well. </p><p>“W-what are you doing!” she stammered. </p><p>“Proving a point,” I countered as I pulled my glistening fingers and waving them in front of her, which was enough to silence her. </p><p>Silence hung between us as Jenny tried to process why she was molested but still ended up as the losing party. “Why did you stop watching the movie,” she asked, clearly trying to change the topic. </p><p>“Because I finished with it,” I answered, and even pointed to my crotch to make my point. </p><p>“But… here…” she answered, shocked. </p><p>“Yes,” I simply said with a nod before facing her with a challenging smile. “Unlike someone else, I can mention, I’m not a coward.” </p><p>“Take that back, I’m not a coward,” Jenny replied in an instant. </p><p>I turned at her, my smirk no different than a hunter examining the beautiful gazelle who just fallen into his trap. “Really?” I said slowly as my gaze devoured her body once again. “Care to prove?” </p>",

    "content": "<p>Half an hour after Aviada’s punishment, our little group was once again fully dressed and was about to finally step out of the cover of the wards that protected the main trade routes and their immediate surroundings. We walked silently, discounting my cheerful whistling holding an upbeat tone. Meanwhile, girls were busy trying to rein in their blushes, their eyes firmly on the ground. </p><p>Not a surprising reaction after our impromptu threesome. </p><p>Teasing them on the subject was tempting, but unfortunately, I had a more important task, getting used to Aviada’s magical sword. I held it tightly, occasionally slashing a nearby tree or stone, watching the target slashed neatly into two pieces. I realized that the last time I had used, I failed to appreciate the true magnificence of the sword, only my enhanced melee skill and increased magical abilities allowing me to understand its true value. No wonder those assholes tried to assassinate her for it.</p><p>Luckily, I had a much better way of staking my ownership.  </p><p>“Are we ready, girls?” I asked when I saw a huge dire wolf dashing toward us, marking the start of the combat. It was merely a class four creature, not even enough to alarm, but its presence showed that we finally stepped into the wildlands, an area most wouldn’t wander without at least a full squad of experienced soldiers. It would take only a slash of my sword to kill it, but I chose to wave my hand instead, and a spike suddenly pushed out of the ground far faster than it could react, nailing it in the stomach. </p><p>[+2 Elemental]</p><p>[-14 Mana]</p><p>“Let’s move,” I said when the girls looked at me questioningly. I understood their rationale, as using magic was rather wasteful from their perspective. However, not only they had no idea about the true size of my mana pool, but also my extreme rate of regeneration thanks to the perks I had gained through the companion system. When I ignored their wordless concern, the girls didn’t push for more. Aviada because she didn’t know much about magic and assumed it was normal for a high-level mage, while Helga was too cagey to raise her concerns in the hearing range of someone else, even that someone was Aviada. </p><p>“Aren’t you going to kill it?” Aviada said questioningly when she saw me walking away from the creature, who was experiencing my extreme leveling method for the first time. </p><p>“Nope, last hits are for you girls,” I answered with a shrug, earning a shocked glance from Aviada. After all, no matter the situation, the experience was a precious commodity to people that were yet to finish their development. Otherwise, why would Aviada spend her nights killing an endless number of level zero creatures just for scraps? “But take turns,” I added at the last moment. When the next creature appeared, Aviada was about to dash forward when I gestured her to wait. “You and Helga are going to stay in defensive just in case something I can’t handle appears,” I reminded her, a direction she followed only after I conjured a small chain of earth, reminding her the last time she chose to disregard my orders. </p><p>Just as I predicted, the presence of the wolf had marked the beginning of an intense skirmish. More creatures appeared, usually below class five, but occasionally close to class ten, but regardless, they took only one move, be it a slash of my borrowed sword, or another elemental trick. It was a tough two hours, enough to leave anyone else below level twenty panting in exhaustion, but I was a unique case. </p><p>[+11 Elemental]</p><p>[+3 Melee]</p><p>[-2450 Mana]</p><p>It was nice to see my skills increasing rapidly. Of course, spending almost double of my mana pool would have been an extravagant waste if it wasn’t for my enhanced regeneration, allowing me to keep my mana pool almost completely full despite the constant rain of assault. I was planning to continue, when I came across a small cliff. It was about fifty meters tall, and it gave a rather impressive view of the area. “Let’s take a breather,” I said as I started climbing the small path upward. </p><p>“Is this a good idea?” Aviada asked. “Won’t we get bogged down if they notice us here,” she added. </p><p>“Of course, that’s the idea,” I answered with a smirk, and the moment I arrived at the top, I used my newly developed elemental skills to modify the cliff generously, enough to turn it into a small fort with thick walls and several arcana runes already carved ready to be powered. Another flex of mana, and they were ready to anchor the wards. </p><p>[+1 Elemental]</p><p>[-240 Mana] </p><p>“I want you girls to stay in defensive. Helga, start carving additional wards in case we have a breach. Aviada, you are responsible for watching the sky and the cliff, just in case a creature manages to slip the wards.” It wasn’t a likely outcome, but it wasn’t impossible either. Both girls nodded, and they started moving rapidly, though even my latest disciplining session was unable to prevent them from snarking at each other. I let it continue, believing it was better for them to get it out of their systems rather than keeping it away from my attention. </p><p>I left them alone in their task and stood in the center of the raised defensive formation, effectively acting like bait. It was a raised platform, because it would allow me to push the wounded creatures on the nearby pit that I had created. I looked around to make sure that everything was in order before casting a lure spell, enough to tempt the surrounding creatures from a mile. It was a dangerous move, but the danger also gave me the chance to maximize my abilities quickly. I wanted to be on top shape before the meeting with Cornelia, as it had the potential of ruining a lot of things. </p><p>Still, even though it was a quick decision, I wasn’t unhappy about revealing my status to Cornelia. Currently, she was the only girl strong enough to give me a few more levels while also being vulnerable enough to keep my secrets. The infighting in her family was much more important than revealing my hidden prowess. Still, deflowering Marianne in front of her was something that would make her angry. I would feel much safer if I could maximize my elemental abilities. </p><p>Soon, a rumble caught my attention, forcing my mind back to the present rather than the evening’s meeting. I could see a horde of undead, consisting of skeletons and zombies of varying strength, dashing forward, large enough to threaten a small town. Still, my smile widened even as I swung my sword, taking the lower half one of them while letting it topple back, tangling with the others, a kick sending an armored one back. The first one was barely class three while the second one was almost class nine, meaning I had to be really careful. Still, I expected the class nine one to be damaged quite a bit by the fall and opened my mouth to ask Aviada to push forward to get the experience. </p><p>[+1 Melee]</p><p>My words died in my lips when I noticed several weak zombies positioning themselves underneath the large one, reducing the damage it took while risking to destroy themselves. That level of coordination was extraordinary, with some dangerous implications for our side. I was suddenly glad of the excessive fortification I had prepared. “Aviada, I want you to stay behind me and kill the ones I let pass. Helga, after finishing the defensive array, wait, but be ready to cast a strong defensive shield.” Cooperation between undead meant someone was controlling them, and I didn’t want to be caught flatfooted in case one of them attacked suddenly. </p><p>Luckily, I had improved my elemental casting abilities significantly during the last two days, turning an impossible battle into a farming opportunity. “Let’s see how dead fares against the inferno,” I shouted while waving my left hand, my right busy swinging the sword to take the legs of a class seven zombie, which then rolled helplessly toward Aviada. I didn’t pay attention to what was happening behind, trusting her to handle an injured monster rather easily. Instead, I focused on tying the firestorm into one of the wards I had created earlier, ensuring that it would keep up as long as it had sufficient mana, then dumped a generous amount behind it. A deadly firestorm appeared in the middle of the horde, immediately roasting the weaker ones while slowing down the stronger ones. </p><p>[+3 Elemental]</p><p>[-320 Mana] </p><p>“Amazing,” I heard Aviada murmur, so I turned back for a split second to wink at her, which made her blush rather sharply. However, as much as I would have liked to flirt with my sexy swordswoman while killing the zombies, a sudden flash of darkness took precedence. I saw a dark bolt traveling toward our encampment, crackling with dangerous energy that made me feel sick even in the distance. </p><p>It was necrotic energy! </p><p>I couldn’t help but curse my luck even as I jumped off the cliff, positioning myself between the fort and the energy. “Aviada, hold the fort,” I ordered even as I pushed my mana on the sword, forcing it to burn brightly with wild lightning, enhanced with a touch of life energy thanks to my biomancy abilities. I took that risk, because while building the fortifications, I hadn’t expected it to stand against a combined assault from the necromancers. Considering there was a generous bounty on each necromancer, I didn’t expect to find one of them so close to the school. </p><p>I shouted even as my sword slashed three times, its speed no less than the lightning itself, managing to disrupt most of the energy. I couldn’t help but feel proud at the move, fitting to be a part of the legends itself. </p><p>[+2 Elemental]</p><p>[+3 Melee]</p><p>[-83 Mana]</p><p>Only a small piece of dark energy escaped my assault and collided with my body. But even that was enough to burn as I had never felt before, draining a significant amount of vitality. Though I was lucky to be competent at biomancy, as a wave of life energy rose immediately to neutralize the necrotic power trying to penetrate my body. Without that, I doubted that I would be alive. </p><p>[-274 HP] </p><p>[-123 Mana]</p><p>I ignored the gasp of the girls in favor of dashing forward the trio of figures that revealed themselves while casting their deadly spell, whose panic was clear even when they were hidden behind their robes. I let out a laugh even as I dashed forward at full speed. These necromancers overplayed their hands in an effort to quickly end the battle, and I was more than willing to punish their arrogance before they could cast another spell. </p><p>“Keep him away,” called the necromancer in the middle panickedly even as his hands dug deep into his pouch, clearly searching for something. The other two waved their staffs and a fresh horde of dead shambled forward, trying to cut my path.</p><p>It was a sound tactic. Too bad it wouldn’t work against me. I was fast enough to avoid the slow but strong ones, and several wind bullets were enough to destroy the fragile ranged units behind. Every swing of my borrowed sword was enough to cut a swathe through the weaker skeletons and zombies, their presence not enough to slow me down. </p><p>The one in the middle, who was clearly the leader, realized the problem as well and took a step back while pulling a pearl from his bag as large as his fist. It didn’t take a genius to realize it was not a trinket, simply because he was trying to pull it while facing the risk of death. “Arise,” he called as he threw it in the midpoint between me and them. A thick layer of necrotic energy escaped it, and the pearl started to unfold into a winged skeleton that was growing very quickly. </p><p>“A fucking dragon!” I called in shock and quickened my pace even further. I had no idea who those guys were, or how they managed to convert a dragon into their undead servant, but I knew that if that dragon managed to cut my path, I wouldn’t last long against three necromancers and it. </p><p>It was time to be creative. </p><p>I used my arcana abilities to cast two spells simultaneously, one to give me temporary invisibility, barely enough to last a moment, while other spell created an illusion. Then, I pumped that illusion with life energy, and sent it against the dragon. The dragon dispelled it with a swing of its claw, but it was all I needed to pass it and stood against the necromancers. </p><p>[-45 Mana]</p><p>Necromancers were too slow to reach anything other than a widening of their eyes as I appeared in front of them. My first swing took the head of two of them, while the third one stumbled back in fear. “Wait, I can-” he started, but another swing ensured that he had no chance to continue his words. And since they were necromancers, I did the prudent thing and sent a wave of flame to engulf their bodies, even though it would destroy any clue about their presence. </p><p>With a skeletal dragon behind me, I didn’t feel like taking risks. </p><p>My instincts blared, and I threw myself forward and rolled, a sharp claw missing me by an inch. I turned after the roll, and barely managed to deflect another attack with my sword. The skeletal dragon must be at least class fifteen, maybe even closer to level twenty, which normally required a large squad of level fifteen warriors and mages. Even with my stats, I wouldn’t be defeat in a direct confrontation. </p><p>Luckily, without a necromancer to lead it, it wasn’t really smart, and I had a lot of tricks to keep it back. “Girls, keep your positions and destroy the rest of the horde,” I ordered when I saw Helga back to back with Aviada, with both of them trying to abandon their well-defended position. They were good, but not enough to cut through a broken horde of undead even if they were wounded badly thanks to the ongoing firestorm, especially with the necromancers that were leading them were dead. </p><p>I could see their reluctance from a distance, but luckily, they followed my order, and stayed on the defensive while destroying the skeletons. I stayed focused on the bone skeletal dragon, using the full range of my melee and elemental tricks to slowly damage its limbs, while biomancy and arcana working wonders to keep it distracted. It took almost an hour for the girls to destroy the horde, while I spent almost two thousand mana to keep the dragon away from me, three of its limbs and one of its wings finally destroyed. I could have killed it, but I preferred to keep it bay not to waste the huge experience it represented, not to mention battling such a dangerous creature for an hour allowed me to maximize my skills, which was only possible thanks to my enhanced mana regeneration. </p><p>[+24 Melee]</p><p>[+28 Elemental]</p><p>[-1951 Mana]</p><p>When the girls finished with the horde, they could be mistaken for zombies in their exhaustion, stumbling forward. Amusingly, Aviada wrapped an arm on Helga, helping her walk despite her own exhaustion. It seemed that our little battle had worked wonders to resolve the animosity between them. Nothing like an extended battle against shambling undead to see the value of other skill sets. </p><p>Seeing them near, I broke the last limb with a mighty swing, leaving the skeletal dragon to collapse helplessly, waiting for the last hits. “So, girls,” I said as I turned to them, presenting the sword for them to grab. “Who wants to do the honors. First come first serve.” </p><p>Aviada was in a better condition, so she grabbed the sword first. But then, she surprised us by presenting it to Helga. “I was the one that killed most of the horde while you supported me, and I leveled up already. You deserve this.” </p><p>Helga looked at her in shock, but Aviada just nodded encouragingly. Helga grabbed the sword, but in her exhausted state, failed to lift it until I used my biomancy to refresh her stamina. It took three swings for her to crack the dragon’s skull, while her horrible lack of skill made Aviada wince. “I’m going to teach you how to wield it,” she murmured, but Helga was too distracted by something only she could see to actually pay attention to us. </p><p>The reason turned clear when she murmured in shock. “Two levels at once,” she murmured in shock, making Aviada look at me shocked. Aviada was smart enough to estimate Helga’s level, putting the creature very close to class twenty. She was shocked, the fact that I was able to play with such a formidable creature for an hour forcing her to revise her estimations upward once more. </p><p>[Achievement: Epic Encounter. Defend your girls tenaciously against a deadly foe well-above your skills. +5000 Experience, +1 All]</p><p>I couldn’t help but smile when I saw the achievement, though it was hard to argue it was undeserved. Three necromancers, backed by a dragon and a horde of undead was enough to make a small city restless, and I managed to defeat it alone with the help of two underleveled assistants. It was an achievement worthy of legends. </p><p>Too bad nobody would know. If my activities today were discovered, the faculty would do their best to control me, afraid of my potential and desiring my power. However, despite the fact that it would ruin everything in the current state of my plans, it wasn’t what I was afraid of most. A small group of necromancers would have never come closer to the school without a good reason, and moreover, raising a skeletal dragon was clearly far beyond their abilities. I wasn’t willing to bet on my survival if their backer learned about my intervention. Still, it was a pity that I had to destroy the bodies of the necromancers, along with all the clues about their source. </p><p>While the girls took a breather, I used my elemental abilities to burn the bodies of zombies and skeletons, including the dragon, then systematically dismantled the wards and the defensive walls. Luckily, the crystal that had been used to power the dragon was still in good condition, so I pocketed it. It was the most valuable loot I had ever acquired, and could be used for many purposes from powering wards to craft weapons. </p><p>On the way back, we had a long discussion on the importance of keeping the battle a complete secret just in case the mysterious leader of those necromancers had the ability to spy in the school. A dangerously likely possibility, as evidenced by the ease I had while exploring the school and taming the ladies.  </p><p>We soon arrived at the school. It was a pity that girls were too exhausted for a celebratory orgy. </p><p>Luckily, I had another visit prepared. </p><p><br></p><p>[Level: 16    Experience: 133050 / 136000 </p><p>Strength: 18    Charisma: 25</p><p>Precision: 13    Perception: 14</p><p>Agility: 17     Manipulation: 20</p><p>Speed: 13       Intelligence: 17</p><p>Endurance: 14      Wisdom: 21</p><p>HP: 1200 / 1200    Mana: 1552 / 1552        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>[Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Expert Arcana [75/75]   </p><p>Expert  Elemental [75/75]</p><p>Advanced Subterfuge [50/50]         </p><p>Advanced Biomancy [50/50]        </p><p>Basic Speech [25/25]        ]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p>",

    "content": "<p>The realization that I had been cockblocked by the sudden involvement of a third party had been annoying even before I realized that the sudden brightness was a fireball that was directly aimed at us. And that wasn’t the only distraction I was feeling, because my new set of instincts roared angrily once more, pushing me to punish the fools that dared to distract me in such an intimate moment. </p><p>For once, I was in full agreement. </p><p>My first thought was to throw a shield up to block the assault, but that plan was ruined by my magic itself, transforming into a sharp and crackly form, extremely unsuitable to form a shield, but excellent for offensive purposes. Transforming it back would have taken even longer. Since my own magic decided to cut me from the defensive strategy, I chose to shape my magic into a penetrating bolt of silvery energy, carefully aiming so that it would pass through the center of the fireball before continuing towards the ship, hoping that it would destabilize the other spell enough to make it harmless. </p><p>I couldn’t help but feel despair when the spell left my hand, because the bolt had come out wrong. It was supposed to be bright silver, crackling with occasional bolts of lightning as it failed to contain its energy. Instead, an anemic ray of crimson left my hand, its surface flickering with ambers. </p><p>The spell had failed, I realized in horror. It was probably due to my unfamiliarity with the changes in my magic, though its forceful transformation definitely hadn’t helped. I couldn’t help but lament as I prepared to grab Lillian and jump into the water. My magic was much stronger, but also much harder to control. </p><p>Not to mention it was almost like it had a mind of its own… </p><p>Lillian turned to me when I grabbed her shoulder, a shocked expression on her face. I didn’t feel like blaming her, as the shift from a heated embrace to a heated skirmish happened too quickly. But before I could drag her into the water, something shocking happened. My poorly-formed attack spell passed through the fireball, and the fireball just collapsed into embers and dissipated while my crimson bolt continued its destination, shining even brighter than the first time. </p><p>I could see Lillian’s face filled with fascination as she turned to me. I relied on my acting skills -sharpened during my time at the school- to reflect pure confidence like I was expecting that to happen all along, but inwardly, I was truly shocked. After hours I had spent trying to get just a rudimentary control over my magic, I knew it was stronger, but effortlessly destroying a fireball with a malformed, anemic spell was well above my wildest expectations. </p><p>In my shock, instead of preparing another spell, I idly watched as the crimson bolt exploded violently against a shield, draining a decent amount of energy from it. Under the bright lights of the explosion, I could see that my target was a longship, a small but nimble ship that was preferred by raiders and pirates alike. </p><p>Taking down a longship along with its crew was doable even with the extremely fragile boat I was currently occupying. However, the brightness of the explosion revealed five longships around the first one, making it an extremely dangerous fight to take, especially with my magic acting out unpredictably. I waved my hand to summon a shield. My magic resisted me once more, but this time, I was prepared for the struggle for dominance, and after a moment of meditation, a shield appeared between us and the ships, just in time to catch several enchanted scorpion bolts and a few lightning bolts before they could hit the ship. </p><p>The only good thing about the ambush was their direction of approach, allowing us an angle we could follow towards the shore. “Take the controls and move to the shore at full speed,” I ordered to Lillian. She nodded and jumped to her feet, though I couldn’t resist the temptation to slap her bottom playfully, my other hand still raised to maintain the shield. </p><p>Our boat started to cut through the water violently once more, this time followed by six longboats. “Full power ahead,” I ordered her when I noticed the distance between us was closing at a dangerous speed. Not all of them, thankfully, but two of the boats were noticeably faster than the others. Clearly, my boat wasn’t the only enchanted one, and I doubted that they were constructed over an afternoon. </p><p>But there was one advantage of shoddy construction philosophy, and I wanted to use it to its limits. “Do you remember my warning about pushing too much magic to the central rune,” I asked Lillian. </p><p>“Yes,” she answered alarmedly. “I remember you mentioning never to do that because it would explode!” </p><p>“Not would, might,” I corrected her, and received an incredulous glare in return when she realized what I was driving at. </p><p>“How likely is the explosion?” she asked, her eyes tightened suspiciously even as she looked at me, ignoring the flares of magic around us as the bombardment of spells were stopped by my shield. At that moment, I couldn’t help but gaze at her beauty. She was even more attractive when she stood strong while spells rained around her. Also, her trust in my strength was interesting. She didn’t even blink, completely sure that the spell would hold. </p><p>“Well, around five percent…” I said, and she relaxed for a moment, “for each minute,” I added, and her expression turned into fury. “Don’t worry. It’ll give clear signs before the explosion, and we’ll have around ten seconds to jump into the water. We’ll almost certainly survive.” </p><p>Her gaze danced between me and the two longboats that were closing in before she let out a resigned sigh, and our boat picked up speed. With that done, I turned my attention back to the shield, the onslaught of spells and arrows too thick for me to risk a counterattack, especially with the aggressive pressure of my magic. I was afraid that if I dispelled my shield, I wouldn’t be able to form another one. </p><p>We escaped, and the longboats followed. The two faster ones were quick enough to maintain the distance, but the other four soon disappeared in the horizon. Luckily, the boat continued to work for almost twenty minutes, bringing us to the visual range of the shore, before I felt the build-up of magic. It was a subtle thing, impossible to notice if I hadn’t been looking for it. It would be impossible to miss in around six seconds, but that wouldn’t have given us sufficient time. I didn’t bother to warn Lillian. Instead, I wrapped my arm around her when I jumped into the water, earning a shocked cry as she was hugged by the icy waters of the midnight sea. </p><p>While she sputtered, I used a spell I had prepared beforehand to push the boat back, directly in the way of the closest boat, and just as it was about to glow unstably, I dissolved half of the shield around it. It still blocked our direct reach to the glass boat, but the same couldn’t be said for the longboat. Panicked cries rose from the raiders as they attacked the boat with a renewed assault, but that only quickened its explosion. </p><p>I pulled Lillian underwater to avoid the sudden wave of heat. When we pulled out, we could see the burning wreck of a boat, while the other was closing the distance to help the injured. “Swim,” I ordered Lillian and started swimming after her, for once, my attention was not focused on the amazing sight of her behind. I wanted to be prepared to attack in case the lightly-damaged longboat decided that catching us was more important than their unconscious friends that would either drown or bleed out without their attention. </p><p>Luckily, they decided to value their friends over revenge or whatever aim they had, because their route stayed focused on the damaged longboat, the long-range spells they threw to me side splashing against my shield ineffectively. </p><p>A few minutes later, Lillian and I stepped on the shore, out of breath after our frantic swimming. Unfortunately, our escape was not yet over. “Run,” I said as we dashed forward. To her credit, she ignored the stones digging into her soles as we ran away. We hurried, because I had no doubt that the raiders would continue to follow us to the mainland. I knew about the criminal world enough that if the leader of the force let us go after we destroyed one of the boats and killed so many of their crew, their reputation would never survive. It was likely the captain wouldn’t as well, Mutiny was always a danger at sea. </p><p>We only slowed down after we stepped into a sparse woodland, but it was enough to block us from the sight of the ships in the distance. They weren’t immediately after our trail, so we had a few minutes to rest. Unfortunately, they had a good point not to hurry up. We had nothing. I would have liked to say we only had our clothes, but even those were lacking, as I had forgotten to grab my pants during the latest stage of our frantic escape. </p><p>“That was something,” Lillian murmured as she leaned about a tree, the exhaustion of the last burst of effort mixing with the earlier strain of magically overcharging the boat. Then, she looked at me, her expression an interesting mix of frustration and fascination. “How the hell are you not anything more than an exhausted pile right now?!” </p><p>She had a point with her shocked outrage. Overcharging the boat was exhausting, true, but it was nothing compared to maintaining a shield around the said boat while under an uninterrupted rain of spells and arrows. None of the mages on the assault force was exceptional, but there were more than a dozen of them. Before the dragon heart, I didn’t think I would be able to resist such an assault for more than a minute, two if I was being extremely generous. But now, even after an extended battle, I was still fresh enough to repeat it, something my instincts were begging me to do. </p><p>And if it was just the remaining boat, I might have actually tried to do so, but I hadn’t forgotten the four other boats following us, and my handle over my changed magic wasn’t good enough to bet on destroying one boat before the others caught up. “I told you I’m strong, didn’t I?” I said, playing my achievement off to Lillian. </p><p>“Yes, you did,” she said as she took a step forward and put her hand on my shoulder. It would have been a simple move if it wasn’t for the fact that she was completely naked, which added a very thick sensual energy to the move, especially when rather than pulling her hand away, she chose to drag her finger down, tracing my biceps. </p><p>I was tempted to push her down and take her there, but unfortunately, we were still in danger. “We need to move,” I said as I caressed her back with an equal suggestiveness, clearly communicating my interest — not that it was needed after the events interrupted by the attack. We trekked deeper into the unfamiliar forest in silence, trying to conserve our breath, more relevant to Lillian than me, because of her unfamiliarity with such intense effort. Her nakedness didn’t help, forcing her to use magic much more than necessary. I stayed behind her to make sure our tracks were hard to find, though the way her naked ass swayed was always a nice bonus. </p><p>Lillian was relaxed as we moved further, but the deeper we moved, the more stressed I started to feel. The reason for that was the suspicious silence around our immediate surroundings. At first, I was alert, afraid of an ambush, but the silence continued even as we continued to move forward, and when I asked Lillian to cast detection spells, she failed to find anything suspicious. I had no choice but to wait, because, with my current control, anything other than blunt combat spells was impossible to cast. </p><p>It took us several hours to find a small cave with a convenient spring. Thanks to magic, it wasn’t impossible to gather water from the plants or condense it from the air, but a source meant that we had an abundance we could use for bathing and other purposes, especially important since we couldn’t distill salt water this far away from the shore. “Finally,” Lillian moaned as she stood next to the spring, stopping only enough to cast a healing spell to fix the wounds that she had accumulated on her feet during the trek, then slipped into the water. </p><p>I followed her immediately, as I didn’t need any healing spells. During the trek, I noticed that one of the changes my body acquired was a slight regeneration, nothing that would work in combat, but perfect against scratches and other small wounds. “That was a difficult journey,” I said even as I dipped my hand in the water and grabbed her foot, gently pulling it on my lap before pressing my thumb on her soles. After her impressive performance and lack of protest, she deserved a reward. </p><p>“It was, but you handled yourself rather well,” she murmured as she leaned back, her breasts hidden under the shimmering surface. She tried to look nonchalant, but she failed to hide the fascination hidden behind her eyes. Understandable, as I was no less shocked by my own performance. The power I was able to display was unbelievable. It was a pity that I lost my versatility, because if it wasn’t for that, I would have returned to the family estate for a frank discussion with my uncle. </p><p>“It’s the result of a secret family technique, too bad that it ruins my control. I have to train myself from scratch,” I explained, giving her some details about my status. With the raiders following us, her having a cursory understanding of my status would help. Naturally, I didn’t share my doubts about the possible permanency of the situation. </p><p>“Lucky for us that you have that, then,” she said with a soft smile, more relaxed due to the distant danger. “I don’t think a full company of guards would have protected me with this level of effectiveness.” The fact that she was here with me was the evidence for that, but I chose not to mention it. It would have been in bad taste. </p><p>“Speaking of your family, we need to talk about the beacon,” I said, not looking forward to sharing my suspicions with her. </p><p>“What about it? Didn’t it get destroyed in the explosion?” I nodded, and she continued. “Don’t worry about it, I can build a new one easily. I just need to rest a bit.” </p><p>“Actually, I don’t want you to build a new one, not for a while, at least,” I explained. </p><p>“What, why?!” she asked, surprised. </p><p>I sighed. “I don’t think it was an accident that raiders managed to find us in the middle of the sea, especially without a blockade where they spread wide. Combine that with the ease the kidnapping happened, it became rather likely that the pirates somehow cracked your communications.” </p><p>“But how!” she said in shock. </p><p>I shrugged. “Long-distance communication is never completely safe. It’s not something that could be casually broken by a pirate, but by now, it’s clear that that captain is no ordinary pirate,” I explained. She looked like she was about to cut me off, but I gestured for her to wait. “Testing it is rather easy. After resting, let’s create a beacon away from here, and put it in a location where we can set up an ambush. If they don’t come, it shows that we can communicate safely. If not, we’ll get rid of some of our followers,” I explained. </p><p>She nodded, but her dissatisfied expression showed that she was clearly unsatisfied with the resolution. I shrugged, and focused on the soles of her feet, trying to get her in the mood once more. She owed me a blowjob, and I intended to collect it with interest… </p>",

    "content": "<p>“What the hell was that!?” Lillian exclaimed as she turned toward me, anger apparent on her face. “Who just goes and decides that it has been a few hours since I have been in a life-and-death battle, and currently on a boat that might explode with one wrong move, so I’ll  use an extremely dangerous refinement technique to kill time!'” she continued, but despite her outward display of anger, her concern was apparent.  </p><p>Despite noticing that, a sharp order escaped my mouth. “Silence!” I called, my voice much sharper than I had ever used in my life, which shocked me even more than it shocked Lillian. The statement was instinctual, and I never remembered actually using a statement like that. “I’m sorry,” I immediately followed, even though saying the words grated on me a lot more than they should have. </p><p>“I understand,” Lillian answered, my immediate apology going a long way to take the wind out of her sails, leaving her confused. It was something I welcomed, because it gave me the excuse to focus on my emotions, only to realize their presence was much stronger in my mind, something I only realized thanks to the iron discipline of a superior magician. I couldn’t help but shudder what would have happened if I hadn’t noticed it, reacting to situations much stronger than normal. </p><p>But even realizing the change was only a partial solution, because the desire to make her pay still throbbed in my mind. It was surprising, though not because I desired revenge. I had always been a vindictive person, more than willing to make people pay when the opportunity arose. However, I was always a meticulous planner, preferring the taste of cold revenge attained in a way my rival wouldn’t even realize my involvement in it. The sudden burning desire to make her pay caught me with surprise. </p><p>However, during the lull of the conversation while I considered the possibilities, I made the mistake of looking up, once again meeting with the naked sight of her body, her pale skin shining ethereally under the gentle rays of the moon, putting her nakedness on the best probable display. It was always a nice sight, one that triggered my desire easily even before, but the sudden roaring inferno of lust caught me flatfooted, my emotions were now pushing me to do unspeakable things to the almost-naked beauty in front of me. </p><p>Rejecting the call of the lust proved to be much more troublesome than rage, especially with the memory of her soft lips still clear on my mind. My hand was already around her wrist and an invite was on my lips when I realized it was the time. “The anger was uncalled for. Let me apologize,” I said while I pulled her onto my naked lap, my body reacting by itself. She gasped in shock, but her attempts to say something was prevented by my lips smashing against hers, which were still rebelling under the impact of my burning desire. </p><p>It took several seconds to get rudimentary control over my lust, in which my hands danced over her body hungrily, leaving several red marks in their uncalled aggression. However, at that point, I had a nice surprise, because rather than trying to pull back, Lillian was responding to my domineering kiss with one of her own, her hands wandering over my body. Not as greedy as mine, but enough for me to decide to abandon my attempts to pull back. That didn’t mean that the weird challenge I was feeling from my emotions had receded, because soon another instinct grabbed my heart, forcing me to push her down, rip her panties, and take her in the most intimate way possible, as soon as possible. </p><p>I decided to reject that instinct. </p><p>My rationale was simple. The sudden desire was clearly related to the changes my body had gone through during the meditation, and I was afraid of them getting even stronger if I didn’t act to control them, just like it would have been if I didn’t decide to take control of my magic. I had no intention of turning into a wild animal. </p><p>No magical transformation had the right to ruin the control I had developed over the years, no matter how strong. </p><p>I let the kiss continue, a decision that may seem counterintuitive at first. After all, pulling away from her tempting body and maybe jumping into the sea for a quick swim to calm myself with the help of the icy waters was the easiest way of avoiding the sudden onset of desire. However, I didn’t just want to avoid the desire, I wanted it under my control, turning into a celibate monk just to maintain control wasn’t an attractive proposition. </p><p>Decision made, I turned my complete attention to Lillian. Her lithe beauty deserved nothing less, especially when she was enthusiastically continuing the hopeless battle for dominance, hoping for a reversal just because she had avoided an overwhelming defeat, unaware of the part my instincts played on the stalemate. My fingers trailed down until my hand was resting on the small of her back, just above where her panties ended, and gently pulled her closer until our chests pressed together, trapping my shaft between our bodies as well. The sudden presence stilled her for a moment, but only for a moment, proving that I wasn’t the only one having trouble controlling my desire. </p><p>It was soon revealed that I wasn’t the only one struggling against the insistent push of the lust. Even after several minutes, Lillian maintained the kiss with the same passion she showed after the initial shock, and the insistent way her lips were dancing mine wasn’t making my situation any easier. “Are all noblewomen as repressed as you?” I murmured during one of the small pauses where we caught our breath. </p><p>The shocked realization on her face was just too beautiful. My words reminded her about the reality of her situation in life, which rarely included trying to devour the lips of a bastard scion of another noble family, especially when said bastard was on the escape. “We need to - stop!” she stuttered, but her statement mattered little when her hips continued to grind against my shaft. </p><p>“Really?” I said even as I pushed my hand through her shining golden hair, enjoying their soft silky texture between my fingers for a moment before yanking her head back. A pained yelp escaped her mouth, especially with my other hand still resting on the small of her back, preventing her from pulling back. Her breath hitched as I leaned forward in torturous slowness, and pressed my lips on her neck. Her pulse flared out of control as I continued to trace her neck with kisses, moving downward. </p><p>I only pulled back when I reached her collarbone, nibbling it gently until she failed to contain a moan. “It doesn’t look like you want to stop,” I asked before turning my attention back to her neck, and she gasped once more. </p><p>“I can’t — “ she murmured, but the rest of her sentence was cut when my instincts flared and took control for a fleeting moment. In that moment, I pulled her head back once more to reveal her neck, and pressed my mouth on the soft spot where her neck connects to her shoulder, this time leaving a not-so-subtle bite mark on her alabaster skin. Looking at that mark filled me with a primal sense of satisfaction, and I had to close my eyes for a moment, once again wrestling down my new instincts, to prevent myself from pushing her down and violently taking her. </p><p>Luckily, she was distracted with the bite itself, and the surprising presence of pleasure that followed, to pay attention to me. “You can’t, what, princess?” I murmured, unlike my internal fight, in a smooth and confident tone. </p><p>She took a deep breath before replying, and I let her succeed. “I can’t … lose my virginity…” she murmured, her whisper would have been impossible to hear if it wasn’t for the body enhancements I had recently received. Her concern was understandable. As the oldest daughter of a prestigious family, her virginity was a precious commodity. Losing it under the normal circumstances would have been devastating enough, but losing it right after she was kidnapped by pirates… </p><p>I decided to soothe her worries, but not before messing with her a bit. Suddenly, I pushed her back, but with my other hand still around her waist to prevent a painful fall. As she moved, my other hand flashed and grabbed her panties. She moved, but her panties kept their position for a moment, giving in with a distinctive ripple, so when she found herself lying on her back on the cold surface of the glass boat, she was, for the first time, completely naked. </p><p>She tried to cross her legs to hide her core, but I pushed my legs forward, preventing her legs from connecting, using the opportunity to slowly examine her untouched folds, surprisingly bare. “Someone is prepared,” I said with a mocking grin, and she just blushed. Since she had been a prisoner for a while with no access to her magic until very recently, it meant that she had spent quite a bit of time in her personal grooming after her magic returned without me noticing, likely when I collapsed after the battle against the dragon serpent. </p><p>“It’s not what you think!” she exclaimed as she hid her face behind her hands, a move that left the rest of her body free for my gaze. </p><p>“Really,” I answered even as I crouched down, my hands on her inner thighs. </p><p>My presence between her legs was enough to push her out of her shame-induced stupor. “What are you — doingg!” she exclaimed in shock, clearly fearing for her virginity, but her words turned into a shocked cry as my tongue darted out and traced her pussy. I raised my head after a few brushes to see her expression, only to find delicious shock. I was willing to bet everything that her shock was about the submissiveness the position was implying rather than the act itself. After all, maids assisting their ladies for relief was a routine part of the noble life. </p><p>For Lillian, seeing me taking me a supposedly-submissive position was surprising, but I had my own reasons for it. I didn’t subscribe to the general idea of oral sex equaling to submissiveness. For me, watching a sexy woman writhing in pleasure under my control was another form of domination, just as she was about to learn soon. Also, my newly-acquired instincts flared against the idea, trying to force me into something more traditionally dominant, making the situation a good opportunity to suppress those instincts even further. </p><p>I turned my full attention to her pleasure, giving a few teasing brushes to her knob to create a memory of pleasure before turning my head to the side, and softly bit her inner thigh, followed by several kisses. I raised my head momentarily when I heard her make a confused growl, my lips curled in amusement to convey the shape of things to come, subtly warning her about the likely divergence from her expectations. Then, I buried my head between her legs once more. </p><p>At first, she stayed motionless while my tongue slowly explored her pleasure, occasionally drifting toward her inner thighs to stretch the situation even further, but from the way she stiffened pointedly whenever I discovered another sensitive spot, she was trying to suppress the outward signs of pleasure. Not a bad counter-strategy for my insidious tactics. </p><p>Too bad that she was destined to lose. </p><p>It took a couple of minutes for the first moan to escape her mouth. I chose to raise my head at that moment, catching the embarrassed expression on her face. “Shut up,” she murmured, and more surprisingly, her hands found my head and pushed it back down. I had to take a deep breath to suppress the foreign rage at her action, once again driven by my new set of instincts, and followed it with a chuckle. After all, Lillian’s transformation was nothing if not amusing. Even a day ago, she would have never tried to make me continue licking her just to avoid a momentary amusement. </p><p>Still, my amusement didn’t mean that there would be no punishment for her presumption. I increased the intensity of my intimate assault, my fingers drifting around her knob to support my tongue, and soon, her moans became commonplace, escaping the prison of her mouth despite her best efforts to keep them suppressed. “More!” she shouted after another few minutes, a statement that was accompanied by another blush, I discovered when I raised my head once more. She was getting close. </p><p>“Really?” I said, trying to make eye contact, but she avoided it by turning her head, and closing her eyes for good measure, this time earning a good-natured scoff from me. It was entertaining just how easily she lost control in a situation of supposed superiority. But that avoidance didn’t last for long, because the closer she got to the edge, the slower my treatment became. She noticed the trend after a while, and her hands reached to the top of my head once more as she tried to push my head down harder. </p><p>I ignored her push and the slight pain resulting from her tight grip around my hair, and started to move upward instead, creating a trail of kisses on her belly. “Please,” she moaned, her grip still tight around my head, but I ignored it in favor of tracing her cute little belly button, each breath  landed on her skin. </p><p>“Please what, princess?” I said mockingly, continuing to climb upward without waiting for her response. </p><p>“I’m almost there,” she begged, her tone far from her usual state and poise. “Just a bit more.” </p><p>“I know,” I answered with all the smugness I could muster. And my happiness wasn’t limited to her amusing state. The annoying tickle of my instincts that was trying to force me to act like an animal finally weakened a bit. It had some dangerous implications, but I ignored those for the moment and focused my attention on caressing the edges of Lillian’s breasts, doing my best to keep her on the edge. </p><p>Teased with a climax that I rejected to deliver, it wasn’t shocking for her hand to sneak down. Unfortunately for her, I grabbed her wrist the moment I noticed it, preventing her plan from succeeding. “No cheating, honey,” I said. </p><p>“Please,” she begged once more. “I want to…” she continued, but trailed off into silence. </p><p>Her sudden shyness was entertaining, especially when she chose not to mention her climax even when she was lying on her back, completely naked, receiving an extended oral treatment after a lengthy makeout session. “You want what?” I asked even as I raised my head from the valley between her breasts, hovering above her instead. “You need to be clearer.”</p><p> She was smart enough to realize without my explicit mention that I would find an entertaining punishment if she dared to pull her head away, but that didn’t change her beautiful eyes from darting to the sides reflexively. I leaned down, my stained lips just an inch away from hers. “Tell me what you want, princess,” I whispered before leaning even closer, her lips parting in preparation, but chose to stop just before making contact, adding another layer to her torturous pleasure. </p><p>“I want to…” she whispered, her breath dancing on my lips. She took a deep breath, and closed her eyes. “I want to … cum.”  </p><p>“Good,” I said, brushing her lips for a moment. “But I want you to say it while looking at my eyes,” I added, this time with a sharper tone. </p><p>She opened her eyes a few seconds later, dispelling my doubts about whether I pushed her too hard. Acceptance shone in them. “I want to cum,” she repeated, and much to my surprise, raised her head and initiated a heated kiss. I decided to reward her spectacularly, and pinned her down with my body while responding to her kiss. My fingers found her core and started dancing around her knob recklessly, helping her to travel the remaining distance to her rapture. </p><p>Soon, she started to moan. Moans that I did my best to suppress with my lips while her kiss lost the power behind it. Her body lost its tension as she lay on her back, trembling repeatedly, her juices staining the glass surface. I pulled back from the kiss, but had no intention of stopping the treatment. Instead, I moved down until my head was between her beautiful thighs once more. My tongue started its task once more, but this time, it was a merciless assault that didn’t give her a second to adapt, mercilessly driving her toward another orgasm. She tried to beg for a breather, but I ignored her passionate cries to push her for another climax. </p><p>Only when she started to writhe in the throes of another dash of pleasure did I pull back and sit in the corner of the boat, enjoying the amazing sight in front of me. I waited until she regained a semblance of awareness, and then spoke in a matter of fact tone that demanded obedience. “It’s time for you to return the favor, princess. Crawl to me!” I ordered, my legs parted to display my erection, leaving no ambiguity about what I was asking her to do. To my greatest pleasure, she followed my order without the slightest hesitation. Soon, she was on her knees in front of me, her delicate fingers wrapped around my shaft, ready to start her task… </p><p>However, the fates apparently decided that after that much entertainment, I needed some misfortune, because it was at that moment I noticed a bright flare cutting through the darkness, rapidly closing in on our boat. I raised my hand, a flare of magic gathering around my fingers, a curse on my lips…</p><p>Whatever the source was, they were going to regret cockblocking me… </p>",

    "content": "<p>When I had saved Lillian from the pirates in a struck of fancy, I knew a battle for dominance was inevitable. However, delivering that battle through our tongues struggling against each other was a surprise. A really pleasant one, especially when Lillian’s reply to my wandering hands was only a brief stall before turning her attention back to the battle of dominance, moaning deliciously. Encouraged by that, my fingers dug into her shapely posterior, enjoying the firmness even as I allowed her tongue to slowly gain dominance, simply because the hint of victory went a long way to mollify her initial stiffness that appeared after my initial overreach. </p><p>Pride was an interesting sin… </p><p>Her attention locked on our kiss, her only reaction was to moan louder when my other hand replicated the move and dug deep into her breast, its size perfectly filling my palm, her nipples stiff enough to tickle the center of my palm. The dance of her lips intensified further, and excitement started to spread in my veins, burning my exhaustion much better than any kind of stimulant could. Even my magic started to move with greater fluidity, still not enough to cast a spell, but at least enough to manage an elemental blast if I skipped on the shape manipulation. </p><p>My heartbeat rose as well, but that revealed a different problem. For a moment, my heart thumped twice before it reduced to one. Only then I realized that my heartbeat was not perfectly centered, and came from two sources, the second just under my heart. It seemed that my risky move wasn’t without its mysterious drawbacks. </p><p>But since I had no idea what to do about the source of that second heartbeat, I shifted my attention back to the sexy blonde on my lap who was doing her best to invade my mouth. I squeezed her body and explored her curves, excitement filling the moment further. And since my naked shaft was throbbing excitedly, I tried to pull her closer to feel her body against it, but that proved to be an overreach. The moment my shaft touched her core -still covered by her panties- she jerked back, a panicked expression on her face, the realization of what she had been doing hitting her hard. </p><p>She even tried to cover her chest once more as she jumped up to her feet, but she abandoned that ridiculous line of action after receiving my mocking glare. After all, there was little point walking around like that after what we had just done. “I will check if there are any ships around,” she rapidly said, and dashed away without waiting for an answer. It was a ridiculous excuse, because from where we were sitting, we had an almost uninterrupted view of the horizon, and it was empty. Still, I shrugged and turned my attention to the meal that was cooking on her improvised runic frying pan. Ensuring the quality of our food was a good way to use my time if she wasn’t willing to entertain her hero… </p><p>I couldn’t help but chuckle when I saw her return twenty minutes later, wearing a makeshift bra made from seashells, connected by a thick line of seaweed. She started speaking in an effort to distract me from her blush. “Is the food ready?” she asked, once again avoiding my gaze, and along with that, my nakedness. Watching her, I didn’t have the heart to tell her that she looked even sexier wearing that makeshift bra, triggering the image of a mermaid, especially strong when stuck on a rocky outcropping in the middle of the sea. </p><p>“Sure,” I said as I passed her one of the large stones I had decided to use as plates. She looked at the plate hesitantly for a moment, like she was stumped on how to eat without a set of three different knives and five forks. “Just grab one with your fingers and eat it, princess,” I said. In reflex, she turned at me to respond, only to avoid it immediately when she met with my nakedness once more. She started nibbling the meat. </p><p>I chuckled before grabbing a plate of my own and started eating, with significantly bigger bites. I had no idea what any of the changes the dragon heart was making to my body, but it clearly needed a lot of food for fuel. Therefore, I was devouring my sixth chunk of meat when she finally finished her first. “You’re really hungry, huh,” she asked, though still avoiding my gaze. But her tone was rather sharp for a casual question. </p><p>She was probably trying to fish for my last display of magic, I deduced. “The spell I  used to finish it off took a lot of energy from me, and it’s just common sense to replenish it,” I answered. </p><p>“Good thing we have enough to last us a while, then,” she answered, pointing at the half-carved body of the dragon serpent.  </p><p>“Yeah, the big guy was rather generous,” I answered. “It’s a pity that we have to leave it behind when we sail away.” </p><p>“What, why?” she answered. </p><p>“Bringing it with us is very dangerous. We could have done it if it wasn’t a magical creature, but we can’t be sure that its blood won’t bring an even bigger predator to us.” </p><p>“Do you think that’s likely?” she asked, but unlike last night, her tone was curious rather than confrontational. </p><p>“Enough to make it pointlessly risky, fishing is much easier,” I answered, then continued with a more serious tone. “Moreover, I don’t want to take the risk of being tracked by the pirates.” </p><p>“Do you think that's possible?” she inquired, her gaze turning to my side. </p><p>“I wouldn’t discount the possibility. There’s a chance that the dragon serpent had a link with the pirates. Maybe they were keeping it trapped as a pet, and sent it to track us,” I said. I didn’t mention the possibility that it was the captain’s familiar. That was a can of worms with too many dangerous implications, and I needed her reasonably focused, not panicking because she was being targeted by an enemy much more dangerous than she had previously assumed. Not to mention claiming that I defeated such a formidable familiar would sound like empty boasting, and would make her trust me less. </p><p>“Maybe you’re right,” she murmured. “It’s appearance is too coincidental otherwise.” </p><p>I nodded as I wolfed down the last piece of meat before standing up. “Excellent, then let’s leave.” </p><p>“Right now?” she asked, surprised. “You’re still exhausted, and while I can use magic once more, wouldn’t it be better to rest some more before starting the journey. I’ve also yet to regain full control.”</p><p>“That’s true, but it’s still better than waiting here,” I answered. “I will feel much safer once we’re on the mainland where they are disadvantaged. In the sea, even with their main mast destroyed, they have the advantage if they catch up with us.” That earned a nod of approval. </p><p>She looked like she was about to say something when I grabbed my pants and underwear but chose to carry them rather than putting them back on. Instead, she silently picked up the beacon she had built to signal her family about her location and joined my walk. Still, her dissatisfaction didn’t prevent her from grabbing my arm to support me when I stumbled from exhaustion. I was feeling better after lunch, but I was still a distance away from my peak condition.  </p><p>“Do you mind operating the boat?” I asked after pushing the boat to the sea and stepped on. “It has sufficient charge to see us to the shore, but I don’t want to risk operating it while my control is still shoddy.” Claiming my control was shoddy was a gross underestimation. With my current state, it was likely that the boat would just explode. </p><p>“Sure,” she said enthusiastically as she gently placed her beacon stone in a corner of the boat, happy with the opportunity to break the flow that positioned her as the helpless damsel of our little story. “Just show me the controls.”</p><p>“Press your finger here,” I said, pointing at the central rune from a distance. She leaned forward and put her finger on it, and in her excitement, forgot the revealing state of her panties, especially since they got wet while pushing the boat into the water. And not one to miss such an opportunity, I walked behind her and grabbed her wrist, correcting her target. “Better,” I whispered throatily. </p><p>She stiffened as my shaft pressed against her bottom, her drenched panties might as well have been nonexistent in terms of reducing the sensation. She gasped, but when her head turned to catch my gaze, she was calm once more. “Weren’t you too exhausted to walk properly just a moment ago,” she said. Her words would have been classified as snark, but the sudden jump in her tone ruined the impression she tried to create, and just exposed her shyness instead. </p><p>“Some things are worth the effort,” I answered even as I leaned further. With my chest pressing against her back, I could feel her heartbeat on my skin. The silence stretched for a moment, but I broke it before she could gather her wits. “Now, try to activate the first rune while spreading your magic to the second and then to this third rune…” I said, launching into a detailed explanation on how to use my construct. It wasn’t something I would have done under more forgiving conditions, as doing so required me to teach her a number of my tricks, but it was a small price to avoid the pirates that were doubtlessly following us. </p><p>“Fascinating,” she murmured as her fingers traced the edges of the carved runes. “I would have never thought that an auxiliary rune can be used to balance three asymmetric sets,” she continued. But even more important than her fascination with my innovative runic construction, her hips started to grind against my shaft slowly. I wasn’t sure whether it was conscious or if it was her instincts subconsciously taking control. </p><p>“That’s all the information you need. The rest, you can handle by yourself,” I said a few minutes later, calling an end to our impromptu class. I would have stretched the explanation even more, but my legs started to tremble, persuading me against extending the compromising lesson. Still, seeing a fleeting expression of disappointment on Lillian’s face was well worth the sacrifice. After all, back in the school, none of the rich scions were able to awaken anything more than a mild disinterest in her. </p><p>Despite her dissatisfaction, she kept her attention on the runic scheme directing the boat, because directing the boat was not something she could have done with wandering attention. That was the drawback of my rapid construction. A proper control scheme would have continued to move automatically without any input, maintaining the required mana flow without active concentration. Of course, a proper scheme required a team of experts to build and took several days, not something that could be compensated for in the middle of nowhere. </p><p>The next few hours passed in silence if I discounted the constant buzz of the wind, and the occasional curse that escaped her mouth. I didn’t try to talk with her, mostly because I didn’t want to distract her from her task. No need to tempt the keepers of fate like that, especially considering their recent performance. However, I wasn’t bored with the silence, because I used the opportunity to try to understand the changes my body was going through after my reckless actions. I kept my eyes closed for the most part, trying to focus inward despite the delicious view Lillian created when she crouched in front of the control panel, her fair skin covered with a light sheen of sweat. </p><p>The first thing I discovered was that my mana flow was much stronger, yesterday’s gentle flow replaced by a torrent of unbelievable depth. I had a feeling that, if it wasn’t for my ruined control, I would have destroyed that dragon serpent without the slightest effort. That discovery didn’t excite me as much as it should, because I was aware that such a sharp increase would have a cost bigger than just ruined control. </p><p>So, I focused on my magic. Soon, I discovered that my magic flow was gathering toward my chest, just a couple of inches below my heart. Under more normal conditions, such a discovery would have been a cause of celebration, because the existence of a core was what separated ordinary mages from sorcerers, giving the latter their phenomenal control and power. A majority of mages, even the noble ones, failed to cross that divide. It was something a lot of nobles failed to overcome all their life, forced to live their life with the awareness that the only thing that lay between them and death was the annoyance of a sorcerer. But I kept my attention on the core, trying to examine it. I knew it wasn’t entirely natural. </p><p>I managed to find the drawback after wasting a couple of hours in meditation. It wasn’t exactly mine. The dragon heart lay on its core, devouring my magic while expelling waves of its own. Its chaotic state didn’t allow me to diagnose it with any sense of accuracy, but even then, I could sense that my magic had changed. How much, I didn’t exactly know, but it wasn’t something that could be written-off. </p><p>Moreover, the dragon heart was still swallowing and expelling magic. </p><p>It was uncharted territory. Not exactly a good realization, considering even in its most documented state, a considerable number of mages eviscerated themselves in an attempt to pass the divide between mage and sorcerer. </p><p>I remembered my grandfather’s saying. 'The weak cry and curse while the strong act!'. Wise words, though as usual, the situation I received those words in was far from casual. He had said those when I was nine, just after I had used lightning magic to kill a pack of hyenas, my body ruined thanks to a mixture of side effects of a miscast spell and wounds delivered by them. Still, the absurdity of the situation didn’t make those words any less true. </p><p>I needed to take control of my magic before it transformed into foreign energy that would burn my body from the inside. I quickly cycled through the meditation techniques that I knew before settling on one that had the highest chance of giving me a semblance of control over my changed magic. It was a painful method that would waste a lot of mana, but luckily, neither was my biggest problem. I had an abundance of magic, and pain was a constant companion during  my youth. It wasn’t my favorite companion, but still, it was much better than death. I sat, legs crossed, and my hands in front of me, just an inch apart. With a breath, I let out a spark from my right index finger, which dived directly into the palm of my left hand. A gasp of pain escaped my mouth as the pain dug into my flesh. </p><p>I felt the boat lurch and realized that I had forgotten to warn Lillian about it. “Are you okay?” she exclaimed. </p><p>“Just a meditation technique, keep your attention on your task,” I managed to answer between my clenched teeth even as a bigger spark escaped from the index finger of my left hand, and disappeared into the palm of my right hand. It was stronger than the previous one, and as a natural consequence, hurt even more. I didn’t even have time to cry when the scene repeated itself… </p><p>The passage of time blurred while my ears filled with the sound of lightning crackling, my arms burning like they were covered with naked fire. If it wasn’t for my changes, I would have only been able to maintain the meditation for a few minutes because of the mana loss. However, now, I barely felt a dip in my reserves while the pain continued to build up. I ignored the pain and persevered, because the quickening flow of my magic was much more important than the occasional gasp of pain that escaped my lips. </p><p>Especially since the changes were not limited to my magic. With each pass, I could actually feel my muscles revitalizing, my earlier exhaustion being replaced by boundless energy, and that energy allowed me to continue the meditation exercise despite the pain. And as the hours passed, even the pain started to dwindle, suggesting that I was actually getting stronger. So, I continued for hours and hours, only stopping when I felt the benefits from the meditation starting to dwindle. Even without casting anything, I could feel that I had some control back. It was the control of a child, but I was satisfied. Even childish spells were dangerous when backed by a sorcerer’s potential. </p><p>When I opened my eyes, it was almost midnight. Lillian turned toward me immediately when the lightning discharges stopped, her eyes filled with worry… It seemed that I had an explanation to give. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I couldn’t help but to feel excited as I walked around the rock and stepped into Aviada’s line of sight with a naked Helga behind me, who managed to miss the fact that she was still naked while still trying to process her last orgasm. Aviada’s face was a work of art, still carrying hints of the pleasure that invaded her body, but the frustration was clear on her face. </p><p>“Bastard,” she growled the moment she noticed me, but despite her disrespect and anger, I was familiar with her enough to see her respect underneath. My forceful attitude was clearly working wonders on her. Things changed a bit when Aviada’s gaze turned to Helga, beset with jealousy. “And the whore is here as well,” she said with an angry smirk, trying to vent her frustrations on her instead. </p><p>Helga stiffened at the insult, her shoulders slouched in a habit born from endless bullying. The insult was dissatisfying enough, as I worked too hard on Helga’s self-confidence to appreciate it being undermined once more, but the insult reminded Helga about her nakedness, and she wrapped her arm around her chest in an effort to hide her amazing breasts, still carrying the marks of my hungry treatment. She would have dashed away if it wasn’t for my hand around her wrist. </p><p>I let her hide behind me even as I took a step forward, a disapproving expression on my face. “That wasn’t nice,” I said, but my tone wasn’t angry. I tried to replicate the tone of a nice but disappointed teacher. Seeing Aviada’s anger flare, I smirked inwardly. I used that tone, because, for all its lack of obvious display of power, it came with an implied superiority. Aviada, despite her spectacular defeat, still saw the situation between us as on the same tier, so she didn’t appreciate the assumption. </p><p>“So what if it wasn’t nice,” Aviada spat with renewed anger. “What are you going to do about it!” </p><p>Aviada was a sharp woman just like a sword. However, just like a sword, her mind worked straight and on right angles, so it took less than a second for me to decipher why she turned her anger from Helga to me. She was trying to goad me into taking a direct action in anger, which would put me in the same position as her. Instead of giving her what she wanted, I sighed deeply. “I’m disappointed, Aviada. I would have expected you to act more mature, but it seems that you haven’t learned your lesson yet. It seems that I need to punish you more. </p><p>She smirked at the mention of punishment, watching me in anticipation as I waved my hand, and a chair formed out of the ground, giving me a comfortable seat. Aviada looked confused until I flexed my magic and her chains suddenly lengthened. Not expecting to lose her support, she failed to resist as she fell forward, and found herself on my lap. “No,” she said in dread as I pulled her pants down, but I disregarded her complaint to land a spank on her bottom. Her shocked cry was a melody to my ears. </p><p>“How,” she murmured in shock. It was understandable, considering her level, I shouldn’t be able to hurt her unless I hit her hard enough to actually inflict damage, and my lazy spank was far from doing that. However, what she didn’t count on was my biomancy skill, modifying her pain resistance temporarily. Aviada lacked the magical ability to notice, but from the soft hum she made, it was clear that it didn’t slip Helga’s attention. </p><p>I ignored the question and spanked her bottom once more, enjoying the blush that was spreading to her naked bottom. Aviada spewed an endless string of threats, each more visceral than the last, but I ignored them in favor of covering her bottom with endless spanks. Five at first, then ten… Soon it reached thirty with no hint of stopping just like Aviada’s insults, but unlike her insults, my spanks didn’t lose the power behind them. On the contrary, each hurt more than the last as Helga examined the spell carefully, occasionally whispering her findings into my ear and allowing me to make changes to increase its effectiveness even further. </p><p>She was truly a genius. Converting her to my side was a true coup. She stood behind me, leaning forward to press her breasts against my neck, as if to remind me that she wasn’t just a genius but a true display of sexiness, which was enhanced by her recent charisma boost. From the impressive radiance she displayed, I guessed that she received three points to her charisma, maybe even more. </p><p>Unfortunately, I had other things to finish before I could taste her new state. With a renewed enthusiasm, I landed several more spanks on Aviada’s bottom, whose insults and arguments were fading rather rapidly after the last modification. “How long are you going to continue?” she murmured. </p><p>“Until I feel that you’ve learned your lesson,” I said even as I landed yet another slap to her crimson bottom. “So, for a start, definitely not while you continue to insult me.” </p><p>“Sorry,” Aviada murmured from her squeezed teeth, and when my hand landed on her ass once more, she stayed silent. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 48%]</p><p>I found it interesting that the companion tracker chose that moment to move forward, but it, more than anything, showed that Aviada was getting off from being dominated. The sudden wetness of her core the moment she apologized was another piece of evidence to support that. Curious, I thought. “Excellent, ten more and we’re done,” I said as she shuffled on my lap, but said nothing. </p><p>I silently counted ten more spanks, but rather than stopping, I continued. “Hey, you promised only ten!” Aviada exclaimed when I was around fifteenth. </p><p>“Yes, but how do I know whether we reached ten?” I said in an exaggerated tone even as I slapped her bottom once more. </p><p>She squeezed her teeth so hard that it was audible, but still, when my hand landed on her bottom once more, her mouth parted open. “One,” she said obediently. I smirked as I slapped her bottom, but this time, instead of pulling it back immediately, I let my fingers momentarily dip into her wetness to reward her obedience, which returned me a tremble in her tone as she counted the second spank. My fingers slipped down, the duration increasing with each spank, so when we reached the end, Aviada was panting in arousal. “Ten,” she said with a sigh, followed by a moan as my fingers danced on her entrance.</p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 49%]</p><p>Aviada continued to lay on my lap obediently, enjoying my caresses while I used biomancy to cure her bottom and dispelling the pain sensitivity spell at the same time. In that moment of laziness, I couldn’t help but think about the implications of the companion system, progressing only in certain situations. With Aviada, there was almost always a domination aspect on the line. Curious, I decided to test that. </p><p>With a flick of my wrist, the chains that were holding Aviada’s arms and legs disappeared, but before she could react, I grabbed her arms, locking them behind her just like I had done before, easily maintaining the grip despite her struggling, much weaker than she was capable of. Even if she had used her full strength -which was higher than mine- I would be able to maintain it thanks to my leverage. I lifted her to slide under her, and took a position behind her, her bottom rising instantly. </p><p>My other hand was empty, but it was easier to cast a spell to free my shaft from the confines of my pants while using my hand to caress her entrance. However, my gaze slipped to Helga, who was looking at me with a frown, and no small amount of jealousy. I caught her gaze, and gestured for her to sit, giving a reassuring smile when her expression gained a questioning quality. </p><p>She wasn’t entirely reassured, but she still followed my order to take a seat. Meanwhile, I pushed my hips forward, pressing my shaft against Aviada’s entrance. “You handled your punishment well, and it’s time for a reward,” I said, chuckling softly when she pushed her hips back enthusiastically. I didn’t let her succeed, pulling my hips back once the crown dipped deeper into her wetness, giving her a small taste to whet her appetite. “Don’t be impatient,” I added, punctuated by a spank to her bottom. “There’s just one thing left to do. You need to apologize to Helga for insulting her earlier. It wasn’t fair for you to call her names.” </p><p>Aviada twisted her neck to catch my gaze, her astonished look replicated by Helga, who was frozen in her seat. Despite their questioning gaze, I just shrugged and stayed silent, waiting for Aviada to speak, which didn’t take long. “If you think I’ll apologize to that little slut-” she started, only to receive a stiff spank to her bottom, which, without the pain enhancement spell, caused an ignoble amount of pain, only the past memories keeping her silent. Which was okay, because the spank was nothing more than to cover for the two spells I applied to her. One to clean and lubricate her backdoor for my invasion, and another for her punishment.  </p><p>“Either that, or I’ll punish you for real,” I said even as my empty hand moved up and grabbed her hair. </p><p>“Do your worst,” Aviada spat out with a satisfied smirk, with the full confidence that she would enjoy the punishment as much as I would. </p><p>That was where she was wrong, but it wouldn’t be apparent at the beginning, at least to her. Helga had a sufficient magical aptitude to understand the aim of the second spell, so she just smirked victoriously as I leaned forward, pushing the tip of my shaft into her puckered hole. Despite the lubrication, her bottom wrapped around my shaft tightly, an effect that was enhanced further by her endless exercising. Her ass was perfection itself, and the prospect of ruining it gave me a fascinating pleasure. </p><p>I attacked her hole mercilessly, impaling repeatedly without waiting for her to adapt, which would have been a disaster to someone weaker, but a high HP pool had usefulness above and beyond killing monsters. Aviada cried, but it wasn’t filled with pain but pleasure instead, my reckless assault pushing her closer to her climax bit by bit, but my and Helga’s smirks got wider the closer Aviada came to a climax, who was too distracted by her own pleasure to notice it… </p><p>A minute later, the reason for it became apparent for her as well. Aviada moaned loudly, her back curling in a beautiful arc in preparation of an explosive orgasm, only to stop confusedly even as I continued to slam her tight hole — which wasn’t as tight anymore. “Is there a problem, Aviada,” I said even as I tightened my grip on her wrists, which proved to be a good idea because she started struggling a moment later, which proved to be ultimately fruitless.  </p><p>“I’ll kill you!” she answered, her angry cry mixing with the sound of flesh hitting flesh. “I’ll make you pay!” </p><p>“Come on, sweetie,” I said even as I increased the pace of my assault, which caused the build-up of another climax thanks to her already charged body, but rather than mollifying her, it only made her struggle harder because of the ending of the process familiar. Helga was watching the situation silently, but from the way she was rubbing her legs together, she was clearly enjoying the sight. Not surprising, considering after all those times she had to suffer under her smug noble peers, it was exhilarating for her to be the observer for once. </p><p>I decided her attitude deserved a reward. Casting the spell to transfer the sensation between two people was a complicated affair, impossible to do while I was struggling to pin Aviada motionless while also pushing her toward another climax. Reversing an already existing spell, however, was much more trivial. I waved my hand, and Helga’s eyes popped open and a moan of shock was ripped from her mouth. She understood what I was trying to do, of course, but my instantaneous casting didn’t give her a chance to react before the ghost of my anal assault started invading her body. </p><p>Helga moaned loudly, enough to break Aviada’s annoyance, who understood that Helga was experiencing the same phenomenon she had gone through minutes ago. Their moans mixed together as they raced towards orgasm, but unlike Helga’s, Aviada’s were tinged with frustration, which was justified, because when Helga’s buildup exploded into an explosive climax, Aviada’s silently disappeared once more, leaving only frustration behind. </p><p>I doubted Helga’s explosive squirting covering her face helped. </p><p>What surprised me was the notification that appeared.</p><p>[Mana regeneration perk activated. Duration, 8 hours]</p><p>The sudden boost in my mana regeneration surprised me in the best of ways. The reason for it was obvious, considering it only happened after I reached fifty percent in Helga’s companion progress, and it triggered only when she climaxed. But the reason for it wasn’t as important as the effect itself. Seeing my mana steadily climbing up was a benefit impossible to overstate, giving me the solution for the biggest mage problem. Combine that with my already huge mana capacity, and my melee abilities to reduce consumption rate, it gave me unparalleled survivability on the field.  </p><p>The unexpected bonus gave me a renewed desire even though I was yet to discover the exact conditions of triggering the perk, or what a perk was. The name was obvious, but I had never heard a mention of them on the books I had read, or any of the doctors that tended to me when I was young had never mentioned something like that either. Regardless, it was another tool in my growing arsenal, even though it came with certain obligations like protecting the source of it. </p><p>Like hanging around a sexy and voluptuous blonde who was as smart as she was sexy was a great chore. </p><p>I decided to focus on that particular finding later on and shifted my focus back to the disobedient brunette who was doing her best to keep herself from moaning—and failing horribly. We had to repeat the cycle of orgasm denial twice more before Aviada opened her mouth for anything other than insults or frustrated moans. “I’m … sorry,” she whispered, impossible to hear without my enhanced senses. </p><p>“Can you repeat that louder?” I asked casually even as I picked up the pace, pushing her toward yet another orgasm, which was getting easier and easier as her frustration built up. </p><p>“I’m sorry,” she repeated petulantly, which put a smirk on my face and astonishment on Helga’s, who was clearly enjoying the superior position she had, though the several orgasms she had experienced was definitely not hurting. </p><p>“Not a bad start, but after all the time it took, I’m not going to accept it without you proving your sincerity.” She turned to me with a questioning gaze. “Helga, open your legs,” I ordered even as I pushed Aviada’s head in further, my painful grip on her hair coming handy. </p><p>Helga followed my command, failing to hide her excitement at the idea. However, Aviada was a completely different issue. “Never,” she spat out as she struggled to get back. </p><p>“Well, your call,” I said even as I picked up speed, steadily pushing her toward another vanishing climax. She turned to me, her eyes filled with a begging expression, but I continued explaning, the amusement in my expression contrasting greatly with my exaggerated clinical tone. “You brought it on yourself by trying to mess with me  close to such dangerous territory,” I said, neatly ignoring the fact that my so-called punishment was much more distracting than her little prank. </p><p>She managed to maintain eye contact as her orgasm drove nearer, her disobedience melting with each second until there was nothing more than a simple flicker in her eyes. But despite her best effort, she wasn’t able to hide the enjoyment she was getting from my total domination. After all, she believed in strength, and what she was experiencing was the purest reflection of it. </p><p>Without saying anything else, she turned around and her head disappeared between Helga’s legs, whose expression brightened in shock and desire. It was nice, but not as nice as the notification I had just received. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 50% - Second Stage Completed +10000 Exp]</p><p>[Achievement: Tough Teacher. Be firm in educating a wayward companion. +1000 Experience, +2 Wisdom]</p><p>Level UP!</p><p>[Select one of the following skills: Expert Biomancy, Expert Elemental, Advanced Speech] </p><p>Gaining another boost to my power was always welcome. As much as having a better aptitude on healing spells or better speech ability would have come useful, I was about to launch a long hunting trip, making elemental the best choice. The fact that it would increase my hand against Cornelia during my evening meeting was only a bonus. </p><p>But leveling up wasn’t the greatest benefit of the activity. No, that honor belonged to Aviada’s companion progress. The fact that it was completed after forcibly bending Aviada to my will told me a lot about her personality. Still, instead of spending time trying to assess the implications of that particular discovery, I turned my attention to the spell that was preventing Aviada from reaching completion, and dispelled it with a wave of my hand. A few pushes later, Aviada started trembling with an intensity I had never seen before, threatening to send her to the land of unconsciousness. Thankfully, her endurance was high enough to maintain her consciousness under the rush. </p><p>[Mana regeneration perk activated. Count 2. Duration, 8 hours]</p><p>The confirmation about the perk system was a nice benefit, and that the effect was stacking was the amazing bonus that came with it. It meant that I could experiment with my elemental abilities freely during the hunt without thinking about saving mana for a dangerous situation, because with the bonus, it would only take thirty minutes for my mana pool to refresh completely, a great improvement to several hours of meditation or sleep like it would normally take. </p><p>I pulled out of Aviada and let her collapse on the ground. She needed to catch her breath before we could start hunting. With a sudden instinct, I reached out and pulled Aviada’s sword from its sheath, stiffening myself for the impact, but it didn’t come. Yet another evidence of my total domination. </p><p>I pushed the sword in the nearby rock, impressed by the effortless manner it disappeared before turning my attention to Helga. Since Aviada was going to need several minutes to gather herself, why shouldn’t I entertain myself in the meanwhile… </p><p><br></p><p>[Level: 16    Experience: 128050 / 136000 </p><p>Strength: 17    Charisma: 24</p><p>Precision: 12    Perception: 11</p><p>Agility: 14     Manipulation: 19</p><p>Speed: 12       Intelligence: 16</p><p>Endurance: 13      Wisdom: 20</p><p>HP: 1088 / 1088    Mana: 1326 / 1440        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>[Master Melee [69/100]</p><p>Expert Arcana [75/75]   </p><p>Advanced Subterfuge [50/50]         </p><p>Advanced Biomancy [50/50]        </p><p>Expert  Elemental [28/75]</p><p>Basic Speech [25/25]        ]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration</p>",

    "content": "<p>“Are we all ready to go,” I asked even as I gave my hand to Aviada to help her stand up, but she chose to ignore it in favor of standing up herself. Despite her overt display of dissatisfaction, it was clear that she was impressed with my confident display. My earlier martial display was enough to keep her in the run. From the frown that appeared on her face when her gaze slid to Helga, I could see that she wasn’t happy with me having multiple partners, but she was willing to play along. </p><p>Helga’s situation wasn’t too different, a bit worse, even. Unlike Aviada, proving my combat superiority hadn’t been enough to remove all of her immediate concerns, but since she was still with us, the promise of leveling assistance was clearly enough to keep her in place. And that was enough, because it gave me the whole day to work on them. </p><p>Both girls nodded after a bit of delay, and we started to walk deeper into the wilderness, the wards protecting the area weakening with each step. It was risky to step outside the protection of the wards, of course, but the danger was the whole point of our trip. </p><p>“Can you pass me your sword?” I asked Aviada without even bothering to look at her as I felt the wards weakening even more. It was a strategic request, as while I trusted myself enough to handle most of the dangers around, especially since the school tried to hunt any creature above level ten as much as possible. It was impossible to exterminate them even in the limited area surrounding the school, but still, it made a good area to hunt in a small group. For most of the other areas, anything smaller than a full squad would have been treated as total insanity, but around the school, it was just extremely risky. </p><p>She growled a bit instead of replying. “Sword,” I repeated, this time turning just enough to catch her gaze. It was a slightly belligerent approach, but at this point, I had a good understanding of Aviada’s personality, and being kind all the time would have damaged our relationship even more. After all, she was a girl that surrendered her virginity only through a physical struggle despite her clear desire. </p><p>“Why don’t you try taking it yourself,” Aviada answered with a smirk. “Do you think you can handle it?” </p><p>I kept eye contact as I brought my hand toward the hilt of her sword, acting like I took the bait. Her smirk widened just as my fingers were about to brush the ornate hilt of her sword. There was no doubt that a magical sword like that had a lot of protective enchantments that prevented it from being used without its owner’s permission. The effect was likely something more humiliating than deadly since Aviada was willing to use the enchantment as a prank, but considering her rather vicious personality, it was hard to rule out extreme pain from the likely effects. </p><p>She seemed certain that her simplistic prank was successful, which was why she failed to react in time when I grabbed her shoulder instead and pushed her against a stone. She hit it with a nice thud, though the pain of it didn’t even register to her. “Nice try,” I murmured into her ear, a move that turned the situation into a tight embrace. “Too bad that you are too obvious with your intentions.” </p><p>“So, what of it?” Aviada whispered back just as satisfied. “You still need my sword, and I’m not inclined to allow you to use it without a bit of pain.” I pulled back enough to stand face to face, keeping my expression clear. “What are you going to do about it, torture me?” she added mockingly. </p><p>“No, no… That would be too much,” I said in an exaggerated calmness. “Regardless, you seem to need a lesson to adjust your behavior.” Before she could say anything, I waved my hand, and four thick manacles pushed out of the stone, wrapping around her extremities, pinning her in place before she could react. I made sure to make them extra strong, enough to keep them in place even if Aviada received another boost like the last time. She was close to reaching fifty percent in the companion system, which I suspected to be another point of explosion. </p><p>[-23 Mana]</p><p>She was caught flatfooted, not expecting me to use magic against her. “That’s cheating,” she gasped in shock and dissatisfaction. </p><p>“And using the protective enchantments of your sword in our little game isn’t?” I countered, and then watched in satisfaction as her expression went alight with realization, followed by a blush. I continued with an amused calmness. “Since you are the first one to break our little rule, there is no harm in using a dash of magic to teach you your place, right?” </p><p>She nodded automatically before she could catch herself, which, upon realization, made her blush even more. “So, what are you going to do, torture me?” she spat out challengingly, though she seemed excited at the possibility. </p><p>“Of course not,” I answered, dismissing the prospect with a careless wave of my hand. “I have other things in mind…” I turned to Helga, and made eye contact. “Could you come here, sweetheart,” I said, and Helga followed the order despite the doubt on her face. I caressed my hand over Aviada’s skin once more, and put a spell up of my own devising, one that was a curious mixture of arcana and biomancy. Aviada failed to notice its initial presence since she was distracted with jealousy as Helga walked closer, unhappy with the sudden third party intrusion to our little game. Her jealousy rose even further when I pulled Helga Into a sudden embrace and stole her lips with a kiss, though when I pulled back, Aviada wasn’t the only one that was looking annoyed. Helga clearly didn’t appreciate being used as a tool to annoy someone else. </p><p>I pressed my finger on Helga’s lips to prevent her outburst even as I turned to Aviada once more. “Feel free to beg for mercy when you’ve changed your mind about giving me permission,” I said, then held Helga’s hand and walked  to the other side of the stone, just out of Aviada’s line of sight while ensuring she would be able to hear everything. Helga followed, but dragged her feet to display her dissatisfaction. </p><p>She spoke only after we reached the other side of the stone, and was thoughtful enough to cast a spell to block Aviada from hearing our discussion. “If you think I’m going to be your toy just so you can-” she started, but I pressed my finger to her lips, cutting her off once more. </p><p>“Do you want to see a brand new spell that uses multiple branches of magical theories,” I said, not bothering to hide the victorious smirk. She looked annoyed, but this time, I knew it was aimed at herself rather than me. The reason, the nod that followed showing her interest. After all, it was far from the worst indignity she suffered on the path of magic. “Watch carefully,” I said even as I raised my hands, and started to build the main part of the spell whose receiver part already placed on Aviada, biomancy and arcana energies melting together in a complicated pattern. “I use the arcana to decode the sensations of the target and for transfer, and biomancy is perfect for replication…” </p><p>[-45 Mana]</p><p>The spell wasn’t exactly cheap even with my large mana pool, but the way Helga’s expression brightened as she examined the complexity was enough reward, not that I was unhappy with the resulting notification. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 47%]</p><p>“The way the main spell matrix is bridged to its connecting parts is just fascinating…” Helga murmured before launching a complicated analysis of the structure, once again showing the sharpness of her mind. Just by listening to her for a few seconds, I already came up with a solution to certain aspects that stumped me before. However, while working together to improve the structure of the spell was tempting, I had more important things to work on, so I leaned forward, cutting her words off with a searing kiss, using the closeness to merge the spell with her. </p><p>[Level Difference of at least 50%! No Experience]</p><p>Helga just gasped in pleasure, not doing anything to counter the spell from affecting her. Why would she, when she knew that it had no impact on her side? Aviada, on the other hand, gasped in shock at the sensation of a kiss was felt on her lips despite not having anyone around. “Caesar,“ she called out in anger. </p><p>I waved my hand to dispel the silencing spell and answered. “Yes, honey, do you need anything?” Even as I answered, my hands were wandering over Helga’s body hungrily, caressing Helga’s body aggressively. </p><p>“You’re playing a dangerous game!” she exclaimed, but it was an empty threat. After all, she was firmly locked in place with nowhere to go. </p><p>“You can just admit defeat, and I’ll let you go,” I reminded her. “You just need to say that you’re too weak to handle a simple magic trick.” </p><p>Aviada’s gasp of shock was almost as arousing as Helga’s sudden expression of arousal. Not surprising, considering the discussion of superiority between magic and martial abilities had been the biggest source of argument between them discounting me. Always opportunistic, I used Helga’s prideful distraction to untie her robes, which she failed to react to until a stiff breeze made her shiver. “We’re out in the open,” she murmured in shock. </p><p>“Yes, we are,” I answered, but my fingers continued their holy task of divesting her from her bulky robe before repeating the task with her blouse, removing both of them smoothly despite Helga’s attempts to ensure otherwise, leaving just a skirt and a bra on her body. When her bra came into view, a smile appeared on my face, because it was wildly different from the bulky ugliness she had been wearing the last time. It was still made from the same fabric, and its edges were a bit uneven to show that the work was probably done by her hand, not that it was even remotely as important as the generous amount of cleavage that appeared as a result, barely held back by the structurally-compromised bra. </p><p>“But anyone can come and see us,” Helga gasped in shock, but I was familiar with her expression enough to catch the excitement underneath. I tried to reach her back, but she pressed it against the rock, cutting off my way to remove her bra. That would not do, I decided, so even as I leaned to press my lips to her neck for distraction, my hand slid under her skirt, and pushed her panties aside. Helga’s gasp of shock arrived just as my fingers got the first taste of her wetness, which was immediately followed by a gasp of arousal as my fingers started violating her core. She still tried to complain, of course, but conveniently, my lips were located in the perfect spot, making the task of silencing her simple and enjoyable at the same time. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 48%]</p><p>Under the combined assault of my lips and my hands, it didn’t take long for Helga to abandon her attempts to play coy and wrap her arms around my body in a passionate hug instead, clearly enjoying the feeling of my muscles over her half-naked body, forgetting that by moving forward, she once again exposed the hook of her bra for me, which I unlocked with a flick of my fingers before trailing down her spine, enjoying her shiver. </p><p>All the while, occasional gasps were coming from the other side of the rock, marking Aviada’s weakening capabilities to keep her reactions suppressed, but I just took a note of it before focusing back on Helga. Aviada still needed some time before she reached the point I wanted. </p><p>Helga let out a gasp when I pulled away from her lips as well, but unlike Aviada’s, it was a sharp, loud one that was filled with need and desire. Such cries no doubt damaged Aviada’s will even more, not letting her forget the source of the erotic sensation that was invading her body. </p><p>Her enthusiastic assistance deserved a reward, so I started moving down, covering the trail with kisses. I took a small break around her chest, of course, enjoying her generous bosom through pressing my lips against her teats aggressively. I would have liked to add my hands to the treatment. Unfortunately, both of them were busy, one with patrolling the sensitive points around her knob, the other was furiously removing the complicated knots of her skirt so that the area was prepared before my arrival. </p><p>Soon, her skirt met with the ground, and I was about to take this as the signal to restart my journey when I felt her hands on the back of my head, pushing me even tighter against her bosom. “Keep sucking,” she shouted. She clearly tried to make it an order, but made a beginner mistake, hoping to compensate for the lack of authority with a louder voice. Also, I wouldn’t be surprised if she was being extra loud just to annoy Aviada. </p><p>I was unable to answer because I was silenced, not that I was unhappy with the method she chose to do so. Any excuse to get a taste of her delicious breasts was welcome. Of course, just because my lips were busy with her bosom didn’t mean the rest of my body stopped in their tasks. My hand that was previously busy getting rid of her skirt grabbed the edge of her panties instead, intending to pull them down.</p><p>My hungry touch aiming to divest her of the last piece of her clothes reminded Helga of the fact that we were in an open field where anyone could stumble into. She grabbed the other side of her panties panickedly, but by doing so, she had forgot one important fact. In her efforts to make her underwear sexier, she had cut a lot of fabric from them, weakening it greatly. So, when she tried to pull it from the other side, it ended with her panties tearing into two pieces, the sound of ripping echoing in the opening. </p><p>Her shy yelp was amusing, but as her arms weakened, I decided to use the opportunity to travel down until I was down to her slit. Only then, did I pull away the hand that was continuously circling above her entrance to keep pushing her closer to orgasm. Just before I dived down to her slit, I raised my gaze up, catching the sudden shyness that colored her face. </p><p>At that moment, I wanted to push Helga on the ground and take her mercilessly until she climaxed again and again. Unfortunately, doing so would have ruined the punishment Aviada was going through. I didn’t want her to climax. Instead, I wanted her to suffer on the edge for a while without the relief of a climax. </p><p>A shiver went through Helga’s body as I leaned forward, which made her thighs jiggle attractively. I waited until my breath fell on her shivering lips before turning my head slightly and leaving a lingering kiss on her inner thigh, finishing with a soft nibble. Her legs trembled in anticipation, threatening her balance enough that she had to lean against the rock to keep herself upright, the same rock that had Aviada chained on the other side… </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 49%]</p><p>Her pleasure was not hard to read, but approval from the system was always welcome, especially when that approval also informed me that Helga was about to cross the likely point for the second milestone, making me curious about its benefits, both to me and to Helga. Wanting to push further, my tongue started to brush Helga’s sensitive spot with increased intensity, enjoying her moans as she drove closer to her climax, but then a second set of cries joined her moans, reminding me of our remote companion. </p><p>“So, Aviada, are you ready to submit?” I asked. </p><p>“Never,” she answered in a raspy cry, showing her mind was occupied by the impending climax. A little frown appeared on my face as I waved my hand, and the main structure of the spell appeared in my sight. Continuing to service Helga while manipulating the spell was difficult, but not impossible. My left hand took the spot that was emptied by my lips and continued Helga’s treatment, while my right hand was busy modifying the spell. Occasionally, I shifted my attention to Helga’s face, enjoying the way pleasure battled with fascination as she watched the number of modifications I was making to the spell. </p><p>Under the circumstances, it was only a matter of time until Helga  exploded with a climax, which happened a minute later, just as I completed the changes to the spell’s structure. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 50% - Second Stage Completed +10000 Exp]</p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Relationship not sufficient for the third stage]</p><p>A wave of joy covered her body as she climaxed, but I was experienced enough with her orgasm face enough to understand it wasn’t just that. “I’m guessing you received a boost to your charisma,” I asked in a whisper. </p><p>“How?” Helga managed to mutter in shock. </p><p>I didn’t know whether she was asking about the achievement she had just received, or how I knew she received it the moment she did, but before she could clarify, another shout reached our ears. </p><p>“What the hell!” Aviada shouted. “Why did it suddenly stop, I was just about to…” she continued before coming to a sudden stop. I smirked, happy to see that the modification of the spell worked just as intended. </p><p>“We’ll talk about the achievement in more detail later,” I told Helga. She nodded, still too distracted by her climax and her achievement as I grabbed her hand and dragged her along while I moved towards the other side of the rock… I was curious how Aviada had reacted to my little trick, and whether Helga would realize that she was still naked… </p><p><br></p><p>[Level: 15    Experience: 117050 / 120000 </p><p>Strength: 17    Charisma: 24</p><p>Precision: 12    Perception: 11</p><p>Agility: 14     Manipulation: 19</p><p>Speed: 12       Intelligence: 16</p><p>Endurance: 13      Wisdom: 18</p><p>HP: 990 / 990    Mana: 1095 / 1245        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>[Master Melee [69/100]</p><p>Expert Arcana [75/75]   </p><p>Advanced Subterfuge [50/50]         </p><p>Advanced Biomancy [50/50]        </p><p>Advanced Elemental [28/50]</p><p>Basic Speech [25/25]        ]</p>",

    "content": "<p>After finishing my preparations, including packing the food, dropping in to my secret stash to take my weapons, and preparing a fake medical notice for the library to explain my extended absence took several minutes, sneaking out of the school bounds while avoiding the guards consumed another few. After that, I dashed away at a pace that would have exhausted anyone without my impressive physical capabilities. </p><p>At first, the road was crowded, intersecting with many different patrols, and several other groups of students and the occasional lone wolf, all geared to the brim, most with at least one magical item strong enough for me to pick up from a distance. Surely, it was nice to be rich. I doubted my family could have afforded to gear me with a comparable item even if it wasn’t for my supposed disabled status. </p><p>But several minutes later, something happened that distracted me from the situation at hand immediately. I stepped out of the range of the ancient wards and defensive enchantments that covered the school. </p><p>It was a weird sensation to be deprived of them completely, I realized, a nervous smile appearing on my face despite my best efforts. I lived under those impressive wards since my magical awareness first developed. Even the special training forests I trained in were under those wards, just partially deactivated to give students space to train. But they were ever present still, ready to snap in place if real danger arose. </p><p>For a while, I stood still, feeling my surroundings without the imposing presence of the wards, trying to understand the difference. Magic was much easier to detect for one, to a point that most of the tricks that I pulled back in the school would have been impossible to achieve outside with my limited capabilities. </p><p>With a sigh, I continued running at the same grueling pace, but kept one of my hands close to my sword at all times. The roads weren’t without protection, but it was markedly different from the ancient wards, at best enough to delay a moderately strong attacker for a minute before collapsing. </p><p>It was also the reason why the occasional group of travelers looked at me with a mixture of shock and fascination. They all traveled in crowded groups, even occasional large caravans with crowded guard regiments. The fact that I was willing to travel alone was a statement itself just as much as my fresh look despite my aggressive pace of movement, which implied significant stats. Luckily, we were close to Silver Spires, so it wasn’t noteworthy enough to raise an alarm. </p><p>After all, there were a lot of students over level ten in Silver Spires. </p><p>Several more minutes later I started to slow down, finally nearing the hidden glade I had assigned as a meeting location for both Aviada and Helga. I hadn’t seen the location before, of course, as my previous condition wasn’t exactly conducive for free exploration, but posing as a servant after I first discovered my powers was helpful in more ways than one, allowing me to pick up a lot of minor secrets. The location of the glade, where a few students were using as a semi-secret gathering location whenever they had a mission, was one of those secrets. </p><p>I was greeted by angry shouts as I got closer, and was about to rush forward until I could discern the lack of urgency behind them, and more importantly, realized that those belonged only to Aviada and Helga. With a sigh, I slowed down, trying to understand the reason for their argument before interjecting. </p><p>“… at least I’m not a meathead that believes that waving a metal club around is the solution for every problem,” I heard Helga yelling in anger. </p><p>“Yeah, and living your life surrounded by dusty tomes is any better,” came Aviada’s reply just as quick.</p><p>“Of course it is, though it’s not surprising in a barbarian's failing to notice that everything in our society works thanks to the magicians and their discoveries.”  </p><p>I couldn’t help but sigh again when I realized the cause of the argument. Yes, the only reason I arranged them to arrive before I did was to see how they reacted to each other’s presence without my involvement -though due to Marianne distracting me, I was even later than I had first planned- but finding them in a childish fight about the validity of their selected discipline was a bit surprising. At least, it wasn’t as bad as it could have been. </p><p>I thought about interjecting myself into the situation, but then decided to check the situation first from an arcane mirror. They were standing far away from each other, their body language signifying no immediate breakout of action, so I decided to stand back and watch them, curious about how things would develop. Their childish bickering about the merits of their own specialization lasted for several more minutes until it ultimately faded into listless jabs. </p><p>I was preparing to walk toward them when Helga stage-whispered. “… at least I don’t have to dress like a whore to get attention.” And just like that, the embers of the argument were inflamed once more. </p><p>Aviada laughed in derision even as she dragged her hand over the sides of her body, accentuating her curves. “Honey, it’s not shameful to tease others about what you have,” she said before grabbing her sword momentarily, her smirk getting a predatory twist, “especially if you can easily prevent people from touching.” I had to admit, Aviada had a point there, as her clothes were tastefully chosen, a tight pair of pants that looked elastic enough to allow a complete range of motion, and a leather top just as tight, but with a few top buttons released. Her armor was limited to her shins and her forearms to protect her extremities against faster creatures without limiting her movements. Her lack of armor was a good choice, because non-magical armor was effectively useless against any creature above class six. And as a bonus, it enhanced her sharp sexiness, which meshed perfectly with her personality. </p><p>Helga was no less beautiful in her own softer, curvier way, but in this situation, her modest manner of dressing worked against her. Unlike Aviada, she was wearing a loose set of robes made of pockets and satchels, and as shapely as a potato sack. She had reasons for dressing like that of course, mostly relating to her relative inability to protect herself, and more importantly, her lack of clout to get away if she actually resorted to doing so. Under those circumstances, the less attention she drew to her figure, the better. </p><p>Of course, oblivious from her sudden spike of anger, the logical reasoning behind her mode of the dress did little to blunt the impact of Aviada’s words. “Unlike you, I don’t need to impress any wandering eye with my body just to have a chance,” Helga answered slowly despite her rage. “He’s discerning enough to appreciate a timely reveal, unlike whatever pathetic brute you’re trying to string along by pushing your breasts on his face,” Helga answered. </p><p>“You wish you had these to push in your little nerdy boy toy’s face,” Aviada countered as she cupped her breasts, once again showing off her boisterous personality. Helga laughed, which was justifiable considering the pair she was hiding underneath her robes. I hid a couple of minutes more, curious how the discussion would develop, but the girls stayed stuck on sniping me, unaware that they were talking about the same person. I shook my head in amusement. </p><p>It was going to be interesting once I revealed myself. </p><p>“Finally,” shouted both girls at the same time when I stepped into the small hidden glade, both of their faces filled with relief as they stepped toward me with determined steps, only to come to a sudden stop as they realized that they weren’t the only one that was walking forward. “What!” they exclaimed at the same time.</p><p>“Hi, girls, sorry to keep you waiting, but I had a last-minute emergency,” I said with a smirk, uncaring of the sudden glares I was receiving. After pushing the situation to this point, I needed to own the situation thoroughly to succeed in my plan of introducing them to each other. “But it’s good to see you getting along well,” I added even as I continued to walk. </p><p>The girls looked at each other in shock, but it was slowly replaced by the realization, which then left its place for anger. In a moment of a sudden feminine alliance, both girls turned to me, Aviada slowly pulling her sword while Helga raised her hands, glowing brightly. “Do you want to explain?” Aviada spoke calmly, though since she was waving her huge sword threateningly, the effect was somehow different. </p><p>“Explain what?” I said with a smile even as I walked toward them, ignoring their sudden fury. It was a tricky situation, but I was just as relaxed inside as I was displaying outside, because I had a plan before inviting them here together, and their reaction was well within my calculations. In the end, neither of them was seduced through my sweet words or lofty promises; they still had no true idea about my identity. Despite that, we were thoroughly acquainted with each other, thanks to my impressive martial abilities in Aviada’s case, and my mental alacrity in Helga’s case. Though my willingness to help them in extremely dangerous situations didn’t hurt my seduction attempts. </p><p>I just needed to impress them with those abilities once more. </p><p>Initially, I had a very complicated fight choreography to ensure the girls wouldn’t be able to bring their full power to the fight, which, at the time of making the plan, was still required to give the impression of effortless domination. However, last night's unexpected gains removed the need for those plans. First of all, I managed to gain two whole levels, with a fresh new branch of magic as a result. Also, I gained five points of charisma, which would be helpful in supporting my arguments. The pure power it would add to my spells was just a bonus. </p><p>“You need a lesson,” Aviada spat out even as she charged forward, waving her sword swiftly. </p><p>I smiled. “You want to spar to warm up before we leave to hunt,” I said even as I pulled out my sword, deflecting her attack with a swing that might have been mistaken for a casual move by someone that was inexperienced, but it required impeccable timing to deflect Aviada’s superior weapon backed by her deadly strength. Though, it wasn’t as strong as it could be, meaning Aviada was just trying to scare me -or just impress me through her seriousness considering her personality- rather than trying to kill me. I took a step forward, far faster than Aviada expected, and slapped her bottom. </p><p>[Level Difference of at least 50%! No Experience]</p><p>The notification was unfortunate, but on the plus side, it highlighted the absolute difference of strength between us. But before I could enjoy my suppression, I felt a tickle in the back of my mind, warning me about an oncoming spell. I didn’t bother to look at it, just waved my hand to force a thick wall of earth out of the ground, and heard the distinct sound of an arcane bolt fizzling out, mixed with Helga’s gasp. I took a step back from Aviada, ducking under her wild swing, which was much faster than the previous one, and spoke. “You girls want to have a spar together, huh? That works for me.” </p><p> I took a few steps back while the girls looked at me with a thoughtful expression, their earlier anger melted away after my show. Their sudden change of heart wasn’t surprising. In the end, in a world filled with monsters, there was nothing more attractive than power, and I had just displayed overwhelming ability simultaneously in their preferred area of expertise. Thanks to my rapid rise of power, I was good enough to contend against the top students of each branch, and with my full range of abilities in play, I was willing to bet that I could defeat the weaker half of the professors even. Also, with twenty-four points in charisma, I exuded a rather impressive aura, which didn’t hurt. </p><p>The girls stood still for a moment, their eyes locked as they examined each other. While my impressive range of abilities didn’t include mind-reading, I didn’t need it to understand that they were trying to assess each other to see whether the other would leave after the reveal, solving the problem neatly. But from their increasing frowns, they slowly realized neither of them had the intention of removing their hat from the ring. </p><p>I decided to interject when I saw Aviada raising her sword, this time pointing towards Helga. “Let’s start the spar,” I said as I flicked a small stone at Aviada, which bounced off of her head. She looked at me with a frown. I made sure to look intimidating, signaling to her that hurting Helga was not a preferred way of solving the issue. “Come on girls, I’m waiting,” I said. </p><p>Aviada didn’t need more prompting and rushed towards my side, this time her movements backed by her full lethality. Unfortunately for her, by now, even her best was not enough to get anything more than a semi-serious interest from my side. But despite that, I made sure to smile at her with my seduction mode turned on, making sure that Helga saw it as well. Helga started peppering me with arcane bolts, forcing me to use my other hand to conjure shields to defend against her, splitting my attention. </p><p>Their teamwork was atrocious, of course. Aviada disregarded Helga’s assault, and Helga was too focused on scoring hits of her own to use her magic in terms of utility, which would have blocked my options to deal with Aviada, turning her into a true threat. I was tempted to step closer to Aviada, tricking Helga into scoring some friendly-fire, but their relationship was bad enough before adding a wild variable. Instead, I started attacking Helga with my own magic, sending waves made of elemental wind, individually weak, but quick enough to force her to take a step. After repeating it a couple of times, she realized my point, and copied my assault with arcane energy, limiting my range of movement, which in turn gave Aviada a strong advantage. There was still a gap between us, but without a free movement area to display my superior mobility, I actually had to try to keep her at bay. </p><p>Her sword was no joke. </p><p>The spar was fun, and if we weren’t supposed to spend the rest of the day hunting dangerous animals in a dangerous location, I would have extended the spar until the girls collapsed in exhaustion. Unfortunately, leveling them up was more important than teaching them about coordinated combat. So, without a warning, I intensified my assault and sent several chains of earth at Helga. She was late in noticing them, and ended tangled up on the ground, where a few more chains pinned her in place. And without her assault, I was once again free to display my superior mobility. I stepped inside Aviada’s guard, easily blocking her last-minute kneeing attempt to wrap my hands around her wrists, forcing her to drop the sword with a twist. After that, before she could adapt to the sudden change of combat, I pinned her in a hold impossible for her to escape from without dislocating her arm. </p><p>[+1 Melee]</p><p>[+3 Elemental]</p><p>[-5 HP]</p><p>[-47 Mana]</p><p>“It was a nice spar,” I said even as I tightened my hold over her, which allowed me to free one of my hands. I first waved that hand to cast another earth spell, which created a moving platform under Helga to bring her closer, still bound in chains. While Helga closed in, I grabbed Aviada’s hair and pulled back hard enough to force a gasp out of her, which I muffled in short order with a heated kiss, just to drive in my dominance further. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 47%]</p><p>When Helga arrived at my side, I pulled out a rope from my small bag and tied Aviada’s hands behind her, still careful to avoid using magic on her. When I dispelled the chains on Helga, I was expecting her to struggle against the kiss, or at least play hard to get, so the searing kiss she initiated was a surprise. A welcome one, though it was only partially about the pleasure itself, which was clear from the victorious glare Helga sent to Aviada. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 46%]</p><p>[Achievement: Subdue the Storm.

    "content": "<p>Watching the plethora of emotions dancing across Marianne’s face as Cornelia left was amusing, though her dazed expression was understandable. After all, just a few minutes ago, she had been walked in on during a very intimate moment, the one that walked in was the one she was cheating on her girlfriend with, then a fight broke out where her famously-intimidating girlfriend had lost with her most important secrets revealed, Marianne got blamed with almost deadly consequences so threatening that she had to seek sanctuary with the intruder, then said intruder stole her virginity without a warning… </p><p>Truly, her confusion was understandable, so I decided to take it a bit slow at first. I pulled out of her. She stood dazedly until I slowly led her to the fluffy carpet soft enough to substitute for a bed -as her bed was ruined due to the water attack from earlier- and directed her to lay on her back, her deliciously plump body present for my attention. I hovered above her, an unusually gentle smile on my lips as my shaft probed her entrance once more. “Don’t worry, you’re mine from now on, and I protect what’s mine,” I whispered. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 2%]</p><p>[+200 Experience] 50% Penalty!</p><p>I watched as my words took the intended effect, which wasn’t entirely shocking. From the beginning, it was obvious that Marianne was more of a follower than a leader, with a clear role in her relationship with Cornelia. Watching her leave defeated without even daring to retaliate even when she watched Marianne’s most precious location being taken left its impact on her. Combined with the endless joy our physical relationship had provided her, it wasn’t entirely shocking that she started to latch onto me. And I had every intention of leveraging the shift in attitude.</p><p>“Tell me what you want,” I whispered into her ear with the intimacy of a lover even as my shaft pressed against her entrance, but didn’t push forward. The blush that spread across her face was utterly delicious, but she was too shy to actually push forward, so I decided to give her a taste. I pushed forward, just enough for the crown to disappear in her entrance, which made her shiver in anticipation, which was quickly replaced with disappointment. “I can’t help you if you don’t tell me what you want,” I whispered once more, following my words with a gentle kiss on her lips. </p><p>She was even more dazed when I pulled back from the kiss, her arms wrapping around my back to pull me back into the kiss. I let her succeed, restarting our slow but delicious kiss, but when she tried to push her hips forward, I was careful to pull back. I wanted her verbal admission before the next step. </p><p>She whimpered. </p><p>“Come on Marianne,” I whispered even as I caressed her hair with surprising gentleness. “We both know what you want. You just need to admit it.” She was still silent. “Your shyness is the only thing that’s between you and an endless wave of pleasure.” </p><p>My little game lasted several minutes, where I caressed, kissed, and teased her until her arousal finally reached the point of overpowering her fear and shyness. “I want you … inside me,” she murmured, her voice fading into nothingness. </p><p>“Sorry, couldn’t hear you,” I said with a wide smile, though I made sure to place a fleeting kiss on her lips to soften the impact. “Can you repeat that louder?” </p><p>This time, my words managed to awaken a reaction in Marianne. “I want you inside me, you bastard,” she growled with a shocking display of passion. Before I could do anything, her legs wrapped around my waist, and using her grip as leverage, she pushed my shaft far into her depths . </p><p>[+500 Experience] 50% Penalty! </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 3%]</p><p>Amused by her sudden initiative, I was preparing to let her lead our horizontal dance, but the fire behind her eyes sputtered and died just as easily as it arrived, leaving only her shyness behind. A pity, I thought even as I pushed forward, filling her insides deeply, enough to make her yelp in shock. It was becoming exceedingly clear that Marianne was going to be a very passive lover for the near future and an overnight improvement was an impossibility, so I decided to enjoy the experience instead. I could always teach her to be more proactive in the future.</p><p>With that thought in mind, I leaned forward and captured her lips once more, but this time, the effect was much stronger because my hips were moving back and forth, filling her insides repeatedly. Seeing her enjoyment, I waited a bit for her to get used to the level of pleasure before adding my hands into the mix, and not even a few minutes later, she was shuddering under a stiff orgasm. </p><p>[+750 Experience] 50% Penalty! </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 5%]</p><p>I pulled out as the orgasm hit her, because I could see that after all the shocks, exhaustion was catching up with her. Of course, I had no intention of suffering from a full mast all night. Luckily, her amazing body gave me a few options. I placed my shaft between her impressive breasts, then started moving back and forth with the full intention of enjoying her jugs.</p><p>Marianne tried to avoid my gaze, but I had no intention of allowing that. I wanted her to fully process what was going on. “Keep your eyes on me, sweetie,” I said, the order behind my words clear despite my soft tone.   </p><p>“It’s … shameful,” Marianne murmured, still keeping her eyes away. I flicked one of her nipples warningly, and with a pained gasp, her eyes met mine instantly. </p><p>“Really, you think that this is more shameful than the time I took your anal virginity during a massage, or what happened mere minutes ago?” I said as I picked up speed, enjoying her growing blush and shock as much as I enjoyed the way her hefty bosom wrapped around my shaft, giving me an entirely new pleasure, especially when I managed to modify a simple water spell into a lubricant, leveraging my new elemental abilities to a maximum.</p><p>“Um, no,” she murmured resignedly, her blush thickening to the point of drowning her, but underneath, her joy and desire were clear. Despite what was on the surface, she was one kinky woman. </p><p>“Good,” I murmured as I picked up speed, not resisting the rise of pleasure. Soon, I was ready to explode. “Open your mouth, and try not to spill any!” I said. </p><p>“Why?” she murmured, but she suddenly understood my aim when the crown pressed against her lips. “No-” she tried to say, but I just used it as an opportunity to slide into her mouth, and as a nice bonus, preventing her argument. </p><p>“Don’t forget to swallow it all,” I said even as I started filling her mouth with my seed, watching an expression of outrage spread on her face. It was amusing to see her anger triggered, even though it didn’t survive when I glanced at her with an amusement that was backed with the full might of my charisma. Her outrage evaporated in a second, leaving an obedient toy doing her best to gather my seed in her mouth -and failing rather spectacularly. And since she was failing, I pulled back and used the rest of the burst to cover her breasts. In a sense, it was yet another sign of my ownership. </p><p>[+500 Experience] 50% Penalty! </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 6%]</p><p>“I’m sorry,” she murmured cutely, so much so that a chuckle escaped my lips despite my best efforts to look stern. The sight of a noble lady, her lips stained with my cum, apologizing for failing to swallow all of it was just too much. It was shocking just how far I came in just a few days.  </p><p>“Don’t worry about it,” I said as I laid down next to her on the floor, enjoying the comfort of the fluffy carpet. It was much better than my bed! Luckily, after today, I had a better bed to sleep in. I gently pulled her to my chest, allowing her to listen to my heartbeat while I caressed her shoulder. And it wasn’t just to strengthen my hold over her. I actually enjoyed sharing the moment of intimacy with her. </p><p>Soon, Marianne’s breathing slowed down, her eyelids getting too heavy for her to keep them open. Soon, she was sleeping against my chest. I could have left her there, but I didn’t have anything else to do until morning, and her sexy bosom was definitely the superior blanket. With that, I closed my eyes, drifting off to  sleep…</p><p>     *****     *****     *****     *****     *****</p><p>[+250 Experience] 50% Penalty! </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 8%]</p><p>It was the notification that forced me out of my comfortable sleep, though it didn’t take long to notice the reason. I could feel the surprising -and very welcome- sensation of a pair of lips wrapped around my shaft, moving in a determined -and a bit mechanical- pace. The identity of my morning wake up service provider was obvious, but even then, I was still surprised to see Marianne leaning forward between my legs, her dark blonde hair sprawled forward to block the view of her face. A rare display of initiative from her, and an extremely welcome one. </p><p>She was too focused on her task to pay attention to me, and I was sufficiently entertained by her courage, so I let it continue. Her lips danced up and down over my shaft, determined to push me into a climax. To reward her initiative -and sate my curiosity about just how far she would push without any external source- I decided to continue acting like I was asleep, and I even decided not to fight the sensation when it was time to explode. </p><p>The next few minutes passed while her head danced up and down, focusing exclusively on the upper side, lacking the experience or courage to take it deeper into her throat. She still had too much to learn. She occasionally licked the side or wrapped her tongue around my girth, showing an instinct for experimentation that she hadn’t displayed during our previous encounters. Maybe thinking that she was lacking observers allowed her to act free from her supposed role, or maybe last night’s activities finally managed to break through her shell. </p><p>Regardless of the reason, I was happy with the service I was receiving, so I continued to feign sleep whenever she raised her head letting her work in comfortably. A simple illusion spell showed my eyelids as closed, allowing me to watch her every move, even when she turned to face me. And it proved useful when she decided to have a change of pace and brought her impressive tits into the deal, their warm caress enveloping the bottom of my shaft, while her lips still continued to work on the top. </p><p>Minutes passed while she worked without breaking her determination, until she got her reward, my seed started to fill her mouth. Once again, she failed to swallow it all, the rest spilling on her breasts, creating a rather interesting view in the process. </p><p>[+500 Experience] 50% Penalty!</p><p>I started clapping softly, and she jerked back, her stained lips stiffening in shock. Shame invaded her face soon after. “Come on, sweetie, you don’t have anything to be ashamed of, it was an amazing show,” I said as I righted myself, and presented my hand to her. </p><p>“It was?” she murmured, once again struggling to process the sudden change of her circumstances. </p><p>Instead of just nodding, I leaned forward to gently kiss her cheek before murmuring another compliment. Only then, I stood up, displaying my naked glory to her eyes, which she watched fascinatingly. Admittedly, it was a nice view. “I need to leave, as I have a full schedule of tasks to complete today,” I said, watching her expression suddenly fall. “But I have just enough time for a shower,” I added as I presented my hand to her, which she grabbed immediately with a giggle. I gently pulled her up before starting to walk toward the bathroom, still holding her hand. She stayed close enough that our bodies were rubbing together every step we took. I was glad for the unforced familiarity she was displaying, though it reinforced the fact that the companion process was a result of the increased intimacy. </p><p>I held the bathroom door open, gesturing for her to step inside in an exaggerated manner, like I was a guard greeting a princess to a high-class ball. “Please go ahead, princess,” I said, replicating the mannerism of an ideal guard perfectly. Subterfuge had surprisingly many fun applications as well. She giggled cutely, which was replaced by a needy moan when I used the opportunity to change mannerism and slapped her bottom suggestively. “A traitor in my palace lusting after my virtue!” she gasped in similarly exaggerated acting, though much less realistic, and dashed forward. </p><p>“Your fate is inevitable, princess,” I answered, following her. I caught her just in front of the tub, which, unfortunately, was still empty. Luckily, my mana was already full from the amazing rest I had, and I was looking for an opportunity to test my extended elemental capabilities. I waved my hand, and a huge wave of water was pulled from the reservoir, its cost barely in the double digits. A flash of fire natured mana ensured the water was sufficiently warm, and I stepped into the water. “Since you have been captured by the rebels, it’s your role to serve me in my bath,” I said as I turned my back to her. </p><p>“As my new lord commands,” she answered, but unlike the last time, her acting was much more sincere. </p><p>[+100 Experience] 50% Penalty! </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 12%]</p><p>Apparently, it managed to trigger a real sentiment from her. And the system approved. A surprising but very welcome development. I closed my eyes, enjoying the way her hands caressed my body with surprising gentleness. She managed to learn some tricks after all the massages she had received. I kept my eyes closed as her soapy hands danced over my back, removing knots and dirt in an equal manner. After finishing my back, she started washing my hair, her service already surpassing the little roleplay we had, and moving into a servant’s role. </p><p>[+200 Experience] 50% Penalty! </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 14%]</p><p>I said nothing, happy with the development. Who would have turned down a willing high-born maid, especially one sosexy? “It’s done, my lord,” she murmured obediently after finishing my back. </p><p>“Good, now, come wash my front,” I said. She tried to reach in from the outside, but I gestured for her to step into the water with me. She was rather excited as she stepped in the water, barely able to maintain her fake demure expression under the rush of excitement. She tried to stay away, but I grabbed her hips and pulled her down, skewering her deeply, earning a gasp in return. She continued to wash my front while her hips twisted on my lap, filling my heart with desire.  </p><p>She took her time washing my front, an enjoyable feeling from my end as well. Therefore, it was understandable that all too late I realized I was about to be late for my meeting. I could have still caught them if I stopped at that moment and rushed to the meeting spot, but that was an impossible decision to make when I was buried deep in Marianne, and enjoying her treatment. Additionally, leaving her like that would have been a thoughtless move. </p><p>However, I didn’t have time to waste. “I’m about to be late for my meeting,” I informed her. </p><p>“Okay,” she murmured, but her expression fell immediately. That expression survived only for a moment, because the next one, after I wrapped my arms around her waist and stood up, keeping her impaled on my shaft. It was surprisingly difficult to balance myself in a slippery tub with a flailing girl on my lap, but agility was useful in many situations other than direct combat. I stepped out and walked toward the towels, each step pushing my shaft deeper into her. A little biomancy trick to enhance her pleasure, and when I arrived next to towels, she was already shuddering under a wave of orgasm, giving me the perfect opportunity to leave her without being too late. </p><p>[+500 Experience] 50% Penalty! </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 15%]</p><p>Of course, when she pressed her hands against the walls to balance herself on her trembling legs, her plump bottom was facing toward me, hitting me with a fresh temptation. Another biomancy trick made sure that her backdoor was lubricated and cleaned. A push later, I was in her tight grip, waves of pleasure filling both of us. “Gaius!” she moaned, not bothering to keep her voice down. </p><p>A slap making her skin ripple was her answer. And she must have liked the answer, because she replied with an even louder moan, enough to suppress the deafening sound of flesh hitting flesh. She was squeezed between the wall and my merciless assault, moaning louder with each push, helpless to resist  against my merciless assault. The situation lasted several minutes longer than I had been planning for, but once gripped by Marianne’s tight hold, I found it hard to leave just because Aviada and Helga might be annoyed a bit. They were big girls, they could handle waiting a few minutes without a major crisis. </p><p>The cry that escaped from her lips mixed with my grunt as I released myself into her, triggering another climax from her as well, which fortunately triggered another power-up from my end, which had been a nice surprise. I had just leveled up last night, and since I had been too busy I hadn’t tracked the experience benefits of stealing Marianne in front of Cornelia. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 15%]</p><p>[+750 Experience] 50% Penalty! </p><p>Level UP!</p><p>[Select one of the following skills: Expert Biomancy, Advanced Elemental, Basic Meditation] </p><p>Biomancy was tempting, but I was going for an expedition, and additional magical damage wouldn’t have been amiss. And the pure damage potential of elemental was simply leagues above both biomancy and arcana, especially considering the area-effect abilities.</p><p>With the skill selection complete, I carried Marianne to her bed in a bridal hold, gently tucking her into bed. She had just woken up, but the chain orgasms she suffered worked quite well to exhaust her despite that. I placed a gentle kiss on her lips. </p><p> [Companion Acquisition: Progress 18%]</p><p>A three-point increase for a gentle kiss was a nice surprise, I decided as I quickly dressed. I still needed to meet with Aviada and Helga, after all… </p><p><br></p><p>[Level: 15    Experience: 105050 / 120000 </p><p>Strength: 17    Charisma: 24</p><p>Precision: 12    Perception: 11</p><p>Agility: 12     Manipulation: 17</p><p>Speed: 12       Intelligence: 16</p><p>Endurance: 13      Wisdom: 18</p><p>HP: 990 / 990    Mana: 1217 / 1245        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>[Master Melee [68/100]</p><p>Expert Arcana [75/75]   </p><p>Advanced Subterfuge [50/50]         </p><p>Advanced Biomancy [50/50]        </p><p>Advanced Elemental [25/50]</p><p>Basic Speech [25/25]        ]</p>",

    "title": "Patreon Changes about Tax",
    "content": "<p>Hi everyone. Sorry to distract everyone with some unsexy news, but apparently, Patreon will have some changes relating to taxes. I put the suggested post prepared for Patreon underneath to clarify things further. But from my understanding, it's effect on you should be even lower than what's outlined below, since most taxes seem to target streaming content rather than general support and early access. </p><p><em>And just to cover for the annoyance, I'll be posting two large image sets. Hope everyone enjoys them. </em></p><p>--------------------------------------</p><p>Hi everyone,</p><p>I wanted to give you an update on some changes that we’ll be seeing which may affect some of your pledges. Due to new laws passing in several countries and US states, Patreon will be required to start charging sales tax on some pledges <strong>starting July 1st. </strong></p><p>Less than half of all patrons will be charged sales tax, and for most, the amount will be very small. For example, sales tax rates in the US range from 4% to 11%, so on a $5 pledge, that would be between 20 cents and 55 cents. </p><p>Whether or not you will be charged sales tax depends on your location, and what is considered taxable there. Not every pledge is taxable, not all benefits are taxable in every location, and sometimes only a fraction of a pledge will be taxable. The money that Patreon collects as a result of these laws are paid directly to local governments.</p><p>I’m working closely with Patreon to ensure I’m able to save you as much money as possible when it comes to sales tax - which is not something that’s possible with other platforms.</p><p>If you’re in a location where sales tax will be required, you should expect to receive an email from Patreon with more information about this very soon, but I wanted to make sure you were aware of these changes way ahead of July 1st when they go into effect. </p><p>If you have questions, you should be able to find answers <a href=\"https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043055071\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. If you still have questions, the best place to get an answer is from Patreon’s customer support team, <a href=\"https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=70716\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. </p>",

    "title": "Dragon's Tale 6",
    "content": "<p>Waking up was a surprise. A big one, considering I had been fighting against a a dragon serpent that was magically empowered through its familiar status, and to defeat it, I had done the craziest thing unimaginable, and swallowed a dragon heart, hoping for a burst of power to kill the annoying creature before the burst of power burned me from the inside. </p><p>Still being alive was a surprise. Staying whole, with my magic still flowing in my body was a bigger one. Even more, I could feel my magic flowing under my skin with a strength I couldn’t even imagine before. But despite its strength, it felt wild, like a magma boiling under a volcano, bubbling threateningly even at its calmest. I was stronger, but I doubted that I could survive an attempt to use that power. And to make things worse, I didn’t know whether it was temporary and permanent. It would have been ironic if it was the latter though, suddenly having access to power that would rival to a sorcerer, but lacking the ability to use it. </p><p>I wanted to focus more on the sensation of power, to understand whether I still had the ability to use magic or crippled myself in the most wasteful manner possible; but the distinct smell of burnt meat reached my nose, dissuading me from spending too much time locked in my mind. I struggled to open my eyes, my muscles burning badly under the exertion - the cost of the latest burst of ethereal flame I had used against the creature. Even trying to sit was a struggle that took most of my power, but when I finally succeed, I had met with a very interesting scene. </p><p>Lillian was standing in front of a stone that was glowing red, with a pile of badly-charred meat next to her, and half carved carcass of the dragon serpent just a few steps away. An expression of total concentration was on her face as she watched a few pieces of meat sizzling on the stone, dissatisfied with the wisps of smoke that was escaping the meat. Of course, her topless state turned the comical scene of her incompetence into an erotic masterpiece, one that tickled my fancy. </p><p>“The rock is too hot, you’ll just burn the meat again,” I shouted. Or more accurately, I tried to shout, but my voice was much more cracked than I would have preferred, escaping in a hoarse gasp rather than the crisp shout I intended. </p><p>Her head whipped up when she saw my state. “You’re awake,” she exclaimed and dashed toward me, abandoning her failed attempts of cooking. And while she dashed forward, she didn’t try to cover her chest, which ended up as an amazing view, her tits tumbling wildly with each step. </p><p>At the incredible sight, my shaft started to awaken despite my exhaustion, which was made visible by the fact that I was still naked. Then she reached my position and hugged me without the slightest hesitation, ignoring my nakedness as her chest melded against mine, and the awakening of my shaft was completed immediately. Never one to miss such an opportunity, I lifted my arms and hugged her body, enjoying the sensation of her naked skin once more. It was a pity that lifting my arms was the limit of what I could achieve at the moment, because I would have liked to push her down and test the extent of her gratitude.  </p><p> “Yes, princess, I’m awake,” I murmured into her ear, but my voice much kinder. Such an enthusiastic naked hug went a long way to resolve my anger toward her, after all. </p><p>“How do you feel?” she murmured, her arms still around my body, her grip desperately tight. No doubt that she was scared about the possibility of my tragic demise. Luckily, fate decided that I was too selfish to deserve a heroic fate, and I was still alive. </p><p>“Like someone replaced my muscles with rocks, but otherwise fine,” I said, making sure to keep the strain I was feeling away from my tone. “And I strained my abilities, so it’s for the best if I don’t use any magic for a while, but there’s no lasting harm, which is the best I could hope for,” I said, sincerely hoping that it was actually the case. I had no intention of informing her about the possibility of my permanent magical injury unless it was completely necessary. After all, now that I was without my magic, even if it was temporary, I needed her help to reach the mainland as soon as possible. It was best not to risk it.  </p><p>I was in a hurry, because without a doubt, whatever grudge the captain had with me had just compounded into a bottomless grudge. Not only I had killed his precious familiar, but also I proved that I stole his priceless treasure. I didn’t dare to bank on the distance between us to keep him unaware of the loss of the dragon heart. There was no way he didn’t detect the power if he had been actively looking -and considering its value, he definitely was- he probably had an alarm to be triggered when the box opened. Still, I needed to gather my strength a bit before attempting to escape. Doing otherwise would have been too dangerous. Sea was a dangerous place. </p><p>“Is there anything I can do to help,” she whispered. </p><p>“Well, your hug is making my situation rather uncomfortable, I wouldn’t mind if you solved it,” I answered. She pulled back, confused, and I gazed downward pointedly. She followed my gaze, and met with the sight of my shaft, which was standing naked in all of its glory. </p><p>“Aiee!” she gasped as she jumped back, blushing furiously, my comment reminding her some important facts, ones that she managed to forget in her elated state. Namely, my naked, and her almost-naked states. </p><p>Her arms reached around her chest once more in an attempt to hide her body, but I just scoffed. “Come on, princess. Don’t you think it’s a bit late for that,” I said. </p><p>“But, it’s wrong…” she murmured. </p><p>“Come on, Lillian. We’re in the middle of the sea, helpless, and running away from a surprisingly skilled band of pirates. A bit of immorality wouldn’t hurt. Think of it as a small reward for my heroics?” I managed to smirk as I raised my arms, giving a caricature strong-man pose. “You wouldn’t deprive your poor hero from the soothing sight of your beauty, right?” </p><p>“You’re a shameless rouge,” she said, trying to sound angry, but that worked poorly when a smile bloomed on her face. If I dared to flirt her like that before, I had no doubt that I would receive a furious lightning bolt, but after saving her life in a manner heroic enough to deserve its own saga, her mood changed rather radically, predictably so. </p><p>“I know,” I said with a smirk, which, despite her best effort, forced a laugh off her. </p><p>She tried to frown as I looked at her expectantly, but her smile was too persistent, accompanying her blush. “I guess you deserved a reward,” she murmured, and her arms fell to the side. </p><p>“Beautiful,” I murmured sincerely, letting my gaze devour her body rather aggressively. Only after a minute, I shifted my gaze to her face, but she avoided my gaze. “So, is it the time for lunch yet?” I asked. </p><p>“Well,” she murmured as she glanced at the charred pile of meat, this time ashamed for a completely different reason. “Cooking wasn’t as easy as I had hoped. Maybe because it’s a magical animal.” </p><p>“Maybe,” I said, giving her some face even though I sincerely doubted that. It was clearly the first time she was even attempting to cook something, and the results weren’t pretty. “Why don’t you help me walk to the stove you created, and we can try once more,” I answered. </p><p>“Okay,” she said before gazing at the small pile of clothes that consisted of my pants and and my underwear. But I ignored that gaze and thrust my hand forward. “Umm, your pants are right there,” she reminded. </p><p>“I know,” I answered, but made no move toward it. And a few seconds later, she reached to my hand and pulled me up, a hint of frustration on her face showing that I was starting to push my luck, a rather dangerous proposition with my magic impaired and hers recovering, though it only made it more fun. </p><p>With her assistance, I managed to stumble the nearest one to her improvised stone. “The stone is too hot,” I said. “That’s why you’re ending up with charred meat with uncooked insides,” I explained. </p><p>“Really?” she asked. “But wouldn’t it cook faster if it is hotter.” </p><p>“Only if you can eat charcoal,” I answered, pointing at the stone. “Erase two of the source runes, and add a conducting in the middle one to balance the heat across the stone. You want an even heat across the stone,” I ordered her rapidly. “And don’t forget to cook some fat on the stone to create a nice non-stick surface,” I added, and she quickly followed the step, and soon, a much more pleasant smell started to radiate from the stone. I didn’t have much expectations about its taste due to the distinct lack of seasoning, but still, it was leagues better than the alternative. And I didn’t want to waste more time than it was necessary. After his familiar found us, the captain couldn’t be too far away. We needed to move before our company turned out to be unpleasant kind. </p><p>Luckily, I had already finished the construction of the ship, including all the movement runes, because in my current condition, even the simplest rune would be a bet between the rune exploding and my fingers exploding. I needed my control back, and I needed it quick. </p><p>Still, I had about half an hour to kill until the meal was ready, so, without a warning, I wrapped my arm around Lillian’s waist and pulled her on my lap. </p><p>“What are you doing!” she exclaimed. </p><p>“You can’t stand until the meat is cooked, it’s going to more than half an hour,” I explained in a calm tone, ignoring her wiggling. And it wasn’t like she was struggling too hard. If she had, there was no way I could have kept her in place in my exhausted state.  </p><p>“Still, I can find a more appropriate place than your lap,” she exclaimed, continuing with her ineffective wiggling. Naturally, it had the opposite effect, hardening my shaft considerably. “I can feel your thing! It’s unacceptable.” </p><p>“And it’s a problem why?” I asked, and she opened her mouth in preparation for an explosive explanation, her gaze telling me that I finally spent whatever respite my heroism managed to earn. I decided to bring in the big guns. “You didn’t have any problem playing with my ‘thing’ this morning,” I said, and just like that, she was frozen on my lap. </p><p>“You were awake,” she murmured, mortified and motionless, and I used the opportunity to wiggle a bit until my shaft was trapped between her cheeks, her fragile panties a poor insulate, especially after the struggle they had gone through. It took a moment for her to realize what she had just admitted to, and tried to recover. “I mean, it must be a dream…” she tried to say, only to stop when facing my flat expression. “I was curious,” she murmured, ducking her head, which highlighted her cuteness. </p><p>“There’s no harm in that,” I said as I patted caressed her head, giving her my forgiveness easily, but still kept my other arm wrapped around her waist. “But where’s the harm in sitting on my lap after that. It’s more comfortable than a stone seat for you, and it keeps me warm,” I explained.  </p><p>“I guess,” she murmured, still skittish. “But, no funny business!” she added a few seconds later.</p><p>“Of course. You can trust me,” I said easily. After all, there was nothing funny about what I was planning for the next step. I wiggled a bit, refreshing the impression she was getting from the presence of my shaft between her cheeks while my hands slid over her stomach, delivering a soft massage to her. But, still mortified by the reminder that she had been caught while molesting my sleeping figure, she failed to comment on my adventurous exploration.  </p><p>A minute passed in silence while my exploration drifted upward. Lillian tried to wiggle to find a more comfortable position, but it only pushed my shaft deeper into the crack between her tight cheeks. “How come you failed your graduation?” she suddenly asked. I would have said that she was looking to distract herself, but I could hear genuine curiosity in her tone as well. </p><p>“Oh, so you’re curious about this poor reject, huh?” I said with a chuckle. </p><p>“Cut the crap,” she countered, equal amounts of shame and amusement in her tone. “I have seen your capabilities. Just the ability build that glass boat is enough to graduate. But you built that alone, without any tool, a feat enough to get you a spot on the top ten,” she explained even as she looked away, once again disregarding the effects her movements had on my shaft. Using the opportunity, I moved my hands upward, so that my thumbs were caressing the bottom of her breasts. She continued speaking. “And I’m not even talking about your fight against the dragon serpent. I don’t think there was ever a student strong enough to defeat a monster like that alone since the great Maximilian, and he then became a hero of the Republic by destroying the last strong of the Druids on Britanium, finally ending a battle that lasted for twenty generations.”</p><p>I agreed with her except the last part, mostly because the only reason I achieved the last part was because I was mad enough to swallow a dragon heart. I doubted the great Maximilian had done the same thing. I wouldn’t have answered her inquiry under different circumstances, but Lillian already seen too much, and owed me just as much that revealing a minor secret wouldn’t hurt. “It’s because failing gave me the chance to escape earlier,” I answered. </p><p>“From who?” she asked curiously, too engrossed with my tale to pay attention to the fingers tracing the underside of her breasts. “House Scipio might not be the strongest family in Britanium, but it’s still not an existence anyone could easily challenge. And with your abilities, your family would have sent a strong force to defend you,” she argued animately, waving her arms for emphasis. </p><p>“That would be true, if I hadn’t been escaping from my family in the first place,” I admitted. She looked at me questioningly after twisting her neck, and the little opportunistic bastard I was, I gently grabbed her waist and led her to turn more, something she absentmindedly followed. Before she could realize its significance, she was already facing directly at me, one leg on each side, our faces dangerously close. Moreover, I had an unrestricted view of her spectacular breasts, and my shaft was very close to a dangerous location. “It’s pointless to go too explain the details of the grudge, but to summarize, there’s an irrevocable divide between me and my uncle,” I said. Sharing the sordid details of my birth or my suspicions about my uncle’s patricide was unnecessary. That was something I needed to solve on my own. </p><p>“That’s…” she murmured, shocked at my words, which was understandable. After all, young talent was the most important thing for the families, especially in a relatively remote area like Britanium. Even a bastard with my skills was too valuable. Of course, she didn’t count on my uncle’s ambitions, or his overwhelming paranoia about losing his seat. I dismissed her unasked question with a shrug. </p><p>“Since you have asked me a question, now it’s my turn,” I said, feeling mischievous. She nodded. “Have you ever kissed a man?” </p><p>The blush that spread onto her face was simply beautiful. “How dare you!” she exclaimed, but rather than attempting to slap my face, the only thing I received was a few soft, almost playful slaps to my shoulder. Though that playfulness had a really interesting implications when she was sitting on my lap almost naked. </p><p>“I’m still waiting for the answer,” I answered, making her blush further. </p><p>She looked at my eyes, begging to be excused, but she only found a mischievous amusement. “No, I haven’t,” she murmured a moment later, her gaze sliding towards the ground. </p><p>“Pity, let’s fix it then,” I said. Her mouth was jerked open, but in shock, she had a delay while forming words, a mistake that I had no complications of abusing, I thought even as my lips pressed against hers, aborting her complains before they could come alive. She stiffened, and I took the opportunity to push my tongue out, gently caressing her lips. Her arms slackened, leaving her chest bare, and I used the opportunity to wrap my arms around her waist, pulling her tight against my chest, enough that I could feel out-of-control thumping of her heart on my chest. </p><p>The kiss lasted for a minute, a minute that she barely reacted, giving me an opportunity to enjoy her first kiss uninterrupted. But then, her arms found my shoulders, and pushed me back. I let her. “What-” she stammered, her face crimson, her breathing out of control. “Why did you do that?” she managed to ask a moment later, but despite her claims of reluctance, she made no attempt to pull her hips back, therefore avoiding my shaft pressing against her core, or tried to cover her naked breasts. </p><p>“Because you’re beautiful,” I answered with a throaty tone, and just like that, the shock was back once more. I gently grabbed her chin, using the slightest pressure to push it up, succeeding without the slightest resistance. Then, I weakened the grasp of my arm around her waist and I closed in the distance with an intentional slowness, giving her ample time to pull back, but she reacted by closing her eyes, her lips widening slightly. Even her tongue darted out in a last-minute attempt to moisten her lips, and then, our lips closed. </p><p>This kiss was different, however. This time, she was not a passive recipient, but an active participant. A hesitant one with significant fears, but an active participant nonetheless. Her tongue darted out, tentatively replicating my tricks. I let let her catch up, before slowly increasing my movements, however, much to my pleasant surprise, she proved to be a quick learner, quickly catching up. Her hands started caressing my back with a reckless abandon soon after, even before I could start. Not one to stay behind in such circumstances, I started tracing her curves, each more exquisite than the last. </p><p>I closed in toward her perfect globes, but hadn’t taken the last step. I was afraid that touching her breasts might have been a step too far under the current circumstances, which was another area she managed to surprise me. She grabbed my wrist without even pulling away from the kiss, but rather than pushing it away, she carried it directly over her breast. Never one to reject such an invitation, I sank my fingers into her breasts mercilessly, until it extracted a beautiful moan, which I had suppressed with my tongue. And since she was showing such an impressive willingness, I let my other hand to slip into her panties, cupping her naked bottom. A gasp was her only reaction. </p><p>I was curious how far I could push in the time remained for our food to cook… </p>",

    "content": "<p>One of the advantages of my earlier maid disguise was the great knowledge it provided me about the surroundings of the noble quarters, including where maids and other servants would be around at this time. With that knowledge, I didn’t even bother to disguise myself, and just used a simple spell that allowed me to meld into the shadows, avoiding the casual attention of the visitors. With that, it didn’t take long for me to arrive at Marianne’s door. Unlocking it was trivial with my great magical abilities, and soon, I stepped inside, unnoticed by the occupants. </p><p>The occupants were busy with rather salacious activities if their heated moans were any indicator. And a smile appeared on my face as I registered the familiarity of their voices. One of them was naturally Marianne, which was to be expected. It was the identity of the other one that put a smile on my face, Cornelia. It had been a while since I had come across her. It was perfect timing, as I was not afraid of her anymore with my recent leveling. Just a couple hundred points would push me to the next level, and I was very enthusiastic about testing the limits of the situation. </p><p>Their voices -more moans and cries- were coming from the bedroom, so I decided to take a peek. A real one, not though the mirror trick I used against the head librarian. With a deep breath, I started wrapping the magic around myself, and soon, an advanced version of the shadow cloak was around me, good enough to hide me from the eyes of two distracted mages as long as I stuck to the corners of the room. Still, I was glad that I spent an hour meditating before visiting here, allowing me to recover a decent chunk of my mana. I was strong enough to defend myself if I revealed myself with a sudden mistake. </p><p>I carefully opened the door, ready to slam a shield to prevent a surprise attack, but the sight I met told me that it was not a concern. Cornelia and Marianne were on the bed, Marianne on all fours, and Cornelia behind her, both of them facing the other way, which made my infiltration trivially easy. I slid to a corner, under the shadow of a wardrobe, and started watching the amazing show. The situation was highly different than the previous time. For once, Cornelia had a strap-on tied around her waist, ramming against Marianne’s tight hole, spanking Marianne’s bottom repeatedly. Her attitude was closer to the time I had watched her torturing Helga than her usual demeanor with Marianne. She was clearly enjoying the opportunity to push forward, unaware that the road she was taking was created by the others. </p><p>However, Marianne’s expression was even more interesting. She was enjoying the situation, but it was a muted enjoyment, nothing even close to the mind-blowing joy she had been enjoying under my attention. I smirked proudly, happy with the impact I had created. Then, I received a very surprising notification. </p><p>[+500 Experience]</p><p>Level UP!</p><p>[Select one of the following skills: Basic Fire, Basic Elemental, Basic Meditation] </p><p>I wasn’t surprised by the new level, or the fact that I gained experience. No, I was shocked, because there was no penalty to my experience gain. I was surprised, as I wasn’t expecting Cornelia to be an even higher level than me. Still, I wasn’t afraid, as no matter what, as long as she wasn’t above level twenty -which she obviously wasn’t- I didn’t have anything to worry about. The overwhelming advantage of my stats combined with my varied skill set made sure that at worst, I could retreat easily. More likely, I could easily defeat her before she could cast a high-level spell. Her flame specialization was dangerous, but slow to implement. </p><p>With that done, I focused on my new level, and after a brief consideration, picked basic elemental skill. Flame specialization offered higher damage, but specialization worked much better for my circumstances. And meditation was rather redundant, as thanks to my melee abilities, my mana expenditure was much lower compared to other mages, and my mana pool likely triple the size of anyone on the same level. High stats across the board was really useful. </p><p>With that decided, I was about to show myself when I noticed a conspicuous bundle of letters among Cornelia’s discarded clothes. The same bundle of letters I had seen her keep in the magically-sealed safe in her room during my visit. I smirked. Since she was kind enough to bare her secrets in such an obvious place, who I was to reject the opportunity. Telekinesis saw that they floated to my hand, and I started reading the letters. </p><p>And to multitask, I conjured a little flame between my fingers, making it dance, soon joined by a piece of earth and a droplet of water, all wrapped with a layer of magically-charged air. It was a ludicrous display of magic that should have been impossible for anyone with just a basic skill, but a combination of my arcana ability, my stats, and the theory discussions I had with Helga, allowed me to show a capability quite a bit above expected. Even better, since I was doing it next to Cornelia -a higher-level mage that would doubtlessly attack me if noticed- it was showing extremely rapid improvement. Just ten minutes later, my skill was already full, not to mention the experience gain from watching two beauties cutting loose. </p><p>[+2000 Experience]</p><p>[+25 Elemental]</p><p>[-14 Mana]</p><p>Meanwhile, I managed to skim through the bundle of letters, and learned quite a few interesting details. They were all in cipher, but against my wisdom and intelligence, it didn’t survive long, especially since she had made the mistake of basing it to an obscure arcana pattern. The first nugget of interest was the fact that Cornelia apparently hit the level cap, which she was desperately trying to find a solution to, but her searches, as expected, turned up no result. Such a thing was either impossible, or it was possible but hidden as the most important secret of an organization, effectively impossible to discover. Of course, Cornelia was aware of it as well, therefore, her real focus was to find a way to allow her to continue earning achievements despite her level cap, or failing that, trying to find clues about items and artifacts that might boost her abilities. She was simply desperate to increase her personal power. </p><p>The reason for her desperation was clarified by the other half of the letters. Thanks to her earlier fight with her caretaker, I had already known about the power struggle in her House, but I hadn’t expected it to be too serious. It was a series of correspondence with a loyal spy back at House Antony, each letter grimmer than the last, informing Cornelia about her allies disappearing or pulling their support. She still had considerable support, but the trend was worrying. Apparently, her uncle was playing for keeps. </p><p>It wasn’t hard to guess that her uncle was playing it safe mostly because of Cornelia’s stellar increase, afraid of making a mortal enemy, instead of trying to lock her into a junior position so that even when she took the reigns of the house, she would be dependent to him. But if he had known about her hitting the level cap before even reaching level twenty… </p><p>Of course, while it was bad news for Cornelia, the same couldn’t be said from my perspective. On the contrary, her vulnerable position gave me the opportunity to move in, and support her. Companion process was a long shot, but even without that, I was powerful enough to easily rival her, and unlike her, I was yet to reach my prime. And more importantly, she had no idea about how strong I could be. </p><p>I could have taken no action, but interrupting seemed a better idea considering the rest of my plan. I first established a ward that would keep anyone from feeling the magical surges unless the spells were overcharged. The establishment of such a ward was impossible to hide from people inside it, so I didn’t even bother, and started clapping the moment they jumped in panic, searching for the intruder. </p><p>It didn’t take long for them to find me since I also canceled the shadow cloak. “Gaius?!” Marianne managed to murmur even as she was frozen in shock once more. She really needed to learn how to handle shock better. </p><p>Cornelia, on the other hand, reacted much more predictably even as she sent a shocked glance at Marianne for recognizing the intruder. Her response came in the form of an impressively hot firebolt, her sweaty body’s shine gaining an ethereal quality under the sudden flash of redness. Combined with her crimson hair, she looked like a goddess of war. </p><p>Therefore, it was amusing to see her confident expression crumble when I waved my hand, and a small sheet of water appeared on the path of the firebolt, extinguishing it easily, partly because of the elemental mismatch, and partly because I subtly reinforced it with an arcana matrix. It was unnecessarily expensive, spending twenty mana where I could have just used four, but the sudden turn was enough to make Cornelia freeze, which was what I needed. From her perspective, I was a strong water expert, a rather dangerous match against her, especially in closed space and a bath next door giving me unlimited material. “Who are you?” Cornelia asked as she raised her arms defensively, flames burning in her palms. And thanks to her lack of clothes, and earlier sexual activities, I was awarded with a chunk of bonus experience. </p><p>[-20 Mana]</p><p>[+1000 Experience]</p><p>I took a step forward, using my subterfuge skill to seem utterly relaxed and confident even though a defensive spell was ready to flicker into existence instantly. “I’m Gaius, as Marianne kindly informed you,” I said smugly as I closed in the distance. “But you might know me as the mule,” I added, watching as a completely different shock invading her face. Before she could say anything, I cut in. “I know, how can it be, weren’t you supposed to be an idiot, and other such nonsense. The easiest explanation is that everything you know about me is a lie, and I have my own objectives that needed to fulfill by playing along, and now that those are complete, I’m free to act. How’s that for a summary?” </p><p>“Very clear,” Cornelia managed to answer, managing to recover a semblance of control during my explanation. But that clarity reminded her of a very important detail. She was still completely naked, and a glistening strapon was tied to her waist. She pulled the covers on herself, ignoring Marianne’s circumstances as she still tried to control her shock. “So, why are you here?” </p><p>“Well, I was here to visit Marianne, to ask payment for my earlier assistance,” I said bluntly, not hesitating for a second before implicating Marianne. Marianne’s gaze danced between Cornelia and me helplessly, but found only amusement at mine, and anger at Cornelia’s. No doubt that Cornelia was thinking Marianne betrayed her, which was perfect for my needs, allowing me to interject myself between them as Marianne’s protector. “But since I had learned about your circumstances, I decided to offer my help.” </p><p>“Marianne-” Cornelia exclaimed, her anger flaring as she came to the wrong conclusion, her flaming hands turning to her bedmate, but once again, I was prepared, and a column of water flew from the bathroom, covering both while also turning the bed into a soaked mess -which I could use for follow-up spells. </p><p>“Stop, it wasn’t her,” I explained even as Marianne jumped off the bed, fear in her eyes as she dashed towards me, ignoring her nakedness, or the way her generous bosom tumbled with each hurried step. She hid behind me, her shivering little to do with her wet state. “You were the one silly enough to bring a full complement of notes of your little rebellion,” I countered. </p><p>“Impossible, they are coded with a-” she tried to say, but I cut her off by creating a floating sample of the exact diagram that she used to hide her letters. </p><p>“Yeah, it took me a minute to solve the cipher. You might think about finding a better one,” I said, reinforcing my image even further. I took a step forward, quite happy to see that Cornelia, the flaming witch that everyone was afraid of, slid back, reflexively pulling the cover up like a little child trying to hide from the big bag monster. It would be lying to say I didn’t find her fear exhilarating. </p><p>However, rather than continuing to walk, I pulled the chair closer and -just to rub salt into the wound- wrapped my arm around Marianne’s waist, pulling her on my lap. She whimpered, but her arm still wrapped around my torso tightly for assurance. After seeing Cornelia’s anger, she subconsciously shifted sides already. I just needed to reinforce it. From the sudden tightening on her face, I could see that Cornelia realized that she fucked up and sent an apologizing glance at Marianne, which she ignored in favor of snuggling into my chest. The disappointment was clear on Cornelia’s face, not to mention jealousy as she watched her girlfriend snuggle in my lap despite her nakedness. </p><p>[+500 Experience]</p><p>“Your concern about my choice of cipher is noted,” Cornelia murmured, trying to seem confident and regal, but it was a hard image to pull off when she was still drenched after my latest assault, and wrapped with an equally drenched bed cover. “However, I’m sure it’s not the only comment you have after reading my most important secrets.” </p><p>“Of course not,” I said even as I moved my hand, grabbing Marianne’s breast. She didn’t like my brazen act of molesting her girlfriend without paying even the slightest concern for her opinion, but other than a flicker of flame between her fingers, she managed to control her anger. “I was actually thinking about helping you?” </p><p>[+500 Experience]</p><p>“Why would you do that?” she said dismissively. “You have read everything. I have no hope of victory against my uncle, and you can get an easy reward by just writing a letter.” She let out a dismissive chuckle as she pulled the sheet tighter. “It’s obvious that I can’t stop you.” </p><p>I had to admit, for someone thinking that her fate was in tethers, she was surprisingly resilient, far better than I would have given her credit for. That impression, more than anything, made me change my plans for her ultimate fate, though I was still going to tame her before elevating her. “Well, that’s true, but you need to ask yourself. What would I gain if I brought the news to your uncle? A few thousand gold, a minor title, or a magical weapon if he was feeling extremely generous.” Her expression changed as I dismissed the possibility of those rewards easily, as they were enough that even most of her noble peers wouldn’t dare to turn their nose at them, especially if they could gain it with little effort. Even just the positive impression from a ruling lord would be enough for them to sell Cornelia out. But I had other plans. </p><p>“And what do you expect me to give you?” she said coldly. </p><p>“That can be discussed later,” I said with a dismissive wave even though my other hand had long disappeared between Marianne’s legs, caressing her wet folds. “I don’t expect you to commit to anything before I prove my ability to deliver.” </p><p>[+1000 Experience]</p><p>“And what can you deliver?” she countered, trying to sound dismissive to get a semblance of control, but it was impossible for her to hide the sudden bloom of hope underneath. </p><p>I smirked even as I continued to finger Marianne, who failed to keep her moans under control. Deep, throaty moans that Cornelia failed to earn despite her best efforts just minutes ago. “I think I should keep that part as a surprise for now,” I said even as I subtly cast a spell. It was a simple one that opened my zipper and pulled down my pants, and Marianne’s moans intensified when she felt the presence of my shaft trapped under her naked butt. “However, I can give you a hint. I could have easily taken control of my family and relaxed as the ruling lord with my power, but I have spent the last several years undercover in the biggest library of the world,” I said, once again ignoring the fact that the library’s supposed the second-largest status according to the system. “Now, imagine what I might have, and why I’m confident enough to help you.” </p><p>“Do you have-” Cornelia started, only to be silenced when I raised my hand in warning. </p><p>“We will discuss it later,” I said, then shifted my hands to Marianne’s bottom, and lifted her up. Then, without a warning, I pulled her down, taking her virginity without a warning. </p><p>[+3000 Experience]</p><p>[Achievement: Daring Defilement. Brazenly snatch the most valuable treasure of a noble lady in front of her significant other with a higher level. +2000 Experience, +5 Charisma]</p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 1%]</p><p>I smirked, enjoying the sudden silence that filled the room, both girls shocked by my action. Cornelia’s eyes were burning with obvious anger, but the rewards I dangled in front of her was just good enough to prevent her from acting. Marianne was just bad at managing surprises, so she simply followed my lead and started grinding her hips despite her dazed expression. Marianne’s companion process was a nice surprise, probably triggered by Cornelia’s sudden betrayal and my protection, and the impression further solidified by my decisive victory. </p><p>Just to drive the situation even further, I unleashed the full impact of my charisma to the surface, but geared toward subtle intimidation. Thanks to the addition of my last achievement, my charisma had reached a devastating level, maybe even to a point of matching the display the head librarian had displayed. </p><p>As a result, Cornelia stiffened, her anger replaced with a healthy dose of fear instead. “I better go,” she murmured and quickly dressed, trying not to look at her freshly-spoiled ex-girlfriend and the rather impressive shaft that was in the process of ruining her, but it was hard for her to avoid it when my charisma worked like a magnet, pulling her gaze to the epicenter.</p><p>“Sure, I’ll visit you in your room tomorrow evening, and we can talk in detail,” I said casually, like invading her living space was nothing more than a trivial chore. Just as she was about to leave, I added one parting shot, just to drive the fact that I conquered her girlfriend in her presence. After all, it was good to finally take revenge for her almost killing me. </p><p>“Also, feel free to join us whenever you feel lonely. I’m sure Marianne wouldn’t mind your presence.” </p><p><br></p><p>[Level: 14    Experience: 101300 / 105000 </p><p>Strength: 17    Charisma: 24</p><p>Precision: 12    Perception: 13</p><p>Agility: 14     Manipulation: 17</p><p>Speed: 12       Intelligence: 16</p><p>Endurance: 13      Wisdom: 18</p><p>HP: 952 / 952    Mana: 864 / 1232        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>[Master Melee [68/100]</p><p>Expert Arcana [75/75]   </p><p>Advanced Subterfuge [50/50]         </p><p>Advanced Biomancy [50/50]        </p><p>Basic Speech [25/25]</p><p>Basic Elemental [25/25]    ]</p>",

    "content": "<p>After signaling Marianne to stay away, I started following the head librarian, my full attention focused on maintaining my mule persona. Every step, every stumble, even the blank expression on my face had to be perfect, just in case her gaze fell on me for a fleeting moment. After all, she was dangerous enough to change the flow of a battle with just her presence, whether it was against the monsters or humans. Even under the most conservative estimate, she was well-above level twenty, and in reality, nobody knew just how strong she was. </p><p>I didn’t know what would happen if she discovered my true nature, but I wasn’t feeling lucky enough to test it, so I followed her obediently deeper into the library. Unfortunately, it was a long walk, and without anything to distract me, I found myself watching the way her body strained her bulky clothing to understand her body type. She wasn’t the busty type, that much was obvious from the lack of a bulkiness around her chest. Similarly her hips were narrow, suggesting that she had a lithe body underneath. Considering that she wasn’t very tall either, it wasn’t hard to guess that without her mysterious clothing, she would have found it hard to put on an intimidating display. Of course, that wouldn’t change the fact that she could rain fireballs with a twist of her wrist, making the observation relatively worthless. </p><p>Then, we arrived at a closed gate, and my heartbeat picked up speed, and a soft gasp escaped my mouth despite my best effort. The reason was clear. She was standing in front of the locked entrance of the restricted section, the room that housed the most valuable and most dangerous pieces of writing in the library. I had never ever thought of attempting to enter, because it was protected by layers of wards, making such an attempt no different than assisted suicide. </p><p>But now, things were different. I carefully watched the shape of her magic, straining myself to commit the complicated flows into my memory -a difficult achievement even with my unbelievable stats. Still, it was an unbelievable opportunity, one that would have been impossible to receive if she hadn’t written me off as inconsequential. Yet another thing my abyssal reputation proved useful for. I stayed focused on the ebbs and flows of the key she was constructing while the wards around the vault deactivated one by one, and soon, the door opened. “Stay here,” she ordered as she disappeared inside. </p><p>I would have preferred to follow her inside. Failing that, I tried to get a feel of her magic to understand whether there were other traps inside, but failed to detect any. Meaning, either the vault didn’t have other wards, or it had the effect of hiding magic used inside while the door was closed. Still, the ability to open the outer shell was a rewarding enough, especially since I just needed to wait around a bit for it. </p><p>It took almost two hours for the head librarian to step out once more, and she pushed a cart filled with an impressive amount of books out. She glanced at my direction before starting to walk once again, leaving the cart behind. I quickly grabbed it and started to follow her, noting that she was considerably more exhausted, making it clear that there were further wards inside, much more difficult ones even. But that was a problem for another day. </p><p>I followed her through less-used parts of the library, then we arrived at another door, this one her own private residence, which she once again used her magic to unlock. It was considerably easier than the earlier vault door, so I memorized it easily as well. I had been expecting her to order me to stop, which was why I was surprised when she gestured me to follow her inside. </p><p>I found myself in a sparsely furnished living room. Surprisingly so, even, considering her reputation and the position she held. She had a large table piled with books, and an even larger bookcase piled with books, but a portion of it completely empty. Other than that, the only thing she had in there was an uncomfortable-looking wooden chair. Her home was as strict and soulless as she was acting outside, apparently. </p><p>My observations were cut short by her order. “Sort the books on the bookcase,” she said, then, once again without saying anything, walked to the other room. I would have liked to use the opportunity to browse the books she brought, but they were sealed magically. It was easy to break, but applying them again in the same manner would be time-consuming. A time that I currently lacked. I could only read their titles. </p><p>It was an interesting mixture. Most of the titles, I wasn’t even able to read, as they used an unfamiliar alphabet. The ones I was able to read, however, included a surprising number of books about ancient history. And, the rest of the shelf was filled with books on legends and myths, making it quite a mystery. Unfortunately, I was not in a position to explore that particular mystery.  </p><p>Still, I didn’t want my journey to be completely useless, and despite her power, her dismissive attitude was starting to annoy me. So, I decided to use a little trick. When she pushed the door close, I created a minuscule magical disturbance, hard to detect without looking for it, but sufficient enough to keep the door from closing. An almost filled expert arcana was surely useful. Then, I cast another spell, this time a small, almost transparent piece of floating crystal, while a linked mirror appeared in my hand, allowing me to watch what she was doing. </p><p>She was facing the other way, but it wasn’t the reason my eyes were widened. No, it was because her hands were on her robe, slowly unlocking her buttons. I slowly placed the books on the shelf, not daring to use any magic for the job while watching her with my full attention. I was surprised when she pulled her hair free from an oppressing bind, and her raven locks flowed on her shoulders. But it wasn’t as interesting as when she started to push her robe down, revealing a pair of flawless and fragile alabaster shoulders, and when it moved down further, a naked back was added to the mix. My eyes widened with shock, as I hadn’t been expecting her to be half-naked under her bulky robes. </p><p>[+100 Experience]</p><p>The other surprise was just how lithe and elegant her body was. If I didn’t know her identity, I would have never guessed her to be the head librarian. It was hard to match her towering identity with her sweet body. When her robe moved even lower, it revealed her tight bottom, clad in her panties, which, unfortunately, was the white and boring kind. I was about to let the crystal disperse when I noticed her fingers reaching for the edge of her panties. I decided to maintain the spell despite its risk, a decision that was rewarded almost instantly when she pushed her panties down, revealing her cute bottom, and with a fleeting sight of her entrance, beautiful enough to wish me that I was strong enough to ravage her without fearing the consequences. </p><p>“Soon,” I murmured to myself. </p><p>Since my luck had yet to disappoint me today, I decided to push further, and watched as she started to walk toward the other door in her bedroom, giving me a full-frontal view of her beauty. Her face was yet another surprise. She had a small, cute face even without makeup, one that should have belonged to a cute flower girl on the corner of the street rather than a scary mage that made everyone tremble under the threat of her bad mood. I could see why she was always wearing that hood and using magic to darken her expression. It was hard to take this cute face seriously. Of course, her small yet shapely breasts and thin waist deserved a mention of their own, completing the little fragile girl image. </p><p>It was impossible to stop once she entered the other room, not bothering to close the door, the sound of flowing water reaching my ears. I let the crystal float to her bathroom, and met with the beautiful sight of her bubble covered body, her impromptu dress melting under the flow of water. Soon, she had nothing but crystal-clear water droplets to cover her body, and since I had already finished my task, I decided to get a bit of reward, and put my hand in my trousers, playing with my erection. </p><p>[+500 Experience]</p><p>[Achievement: Dancing with Death. Stretch a hidden situation to its limit with the full knowledge of the cost of failure. +1000 Experience, +2 Perception, +2 Agility]</p><p>Unfortunately, her shower stopped before I could attain my release, so, with great disappointment, I released the spell and fixed my pants, and waited for her to appear. </p><p>On that, I received another surprise, as I hadn’t been expecting her to walk into the living room naked. Oh, she had an illusion on, but it was impossible to slip such a thing by a master of subterfuge like myself. And with that awareness, denying the illusion and seeing her naked body was trivial for me. Just like that, my heartbeat rose to a peak. After all, not every day did the legendary librarian stand in front of me, stark naked and bent over as she examined the bookcase, tempting me with damnation. </p><p>“Everything is in order, you can leave,” she said, and I immediately turned and left the room, not trusting myself not to react in a way that would reveal myself if I continued to be subjected to that heavenly sight anymore. </p><p>When I walked out, there was a determination in my steps, and I even used several spells to find my target easily. Soon, I was standing a shelf away from Helga, and a floating note reached to her. Her eyes widened with shock, but I didn’t waste time watching, just walking in determined steps as I reached the storage room I described in the note, casting several wards in succession while waiting for her to appear. Anti-detection, silencing, locking, even climate-control. Helga had a worried expression on her face when she stepped in. She opened her mouth to ask, but before the first word could leave her lips, mine was already on hers, devouring her lips hungrily. </p><p>[Level Difference of at least 50%! No Experience]</p><p>She froze under the assault for a moment, but it didn’t take long for her lips to join the dance, her hands starting to caress my muscles, creating a pleasant, soothing sensation. Any other time, I would have let her continue, happy to see her taking initiative, but I was simply too aroused after watching the librarian’s unintentional show. A part of my mind acknowledged that it was the effect of her high charisma, only flowing free rather than leveraged for intimidation purposes; and the adrenaline from the fear of getting caught didn’t help my state of mind any. </p><p>However, regardless of its partially supernatural reasons, I was extremely horny, so I needed to solve it. I grabbed Helga’s robe and pulled, her buttons flying around. Before she could even let out a gasp, her blouse and underwear received the same treatment, no different than paper under my great strength. “My clothes,” she gasped in shock even as I grabbed her hips, and forced her to turn. She found herself against the wall, her bosom pressing the cold stone walls. </p><p>“Don’t worry, I’ll buy you better stuff,” I answered even as I pulled the robe off her, leaving her half-naked, with only her long skirt to cover her legs. A grievous issue that needed to be fixed immediately, I decided, and pulled her skirt up, gathering it around her waist, expecting to reveal her panties, which was why I was pleasantly surprised when I saw they were missing. “Naughty girl,” I said even as I slapped her bottom, her booty rippling sensually, breaking the last hold of rationality over my mind. </p><p>“For you,” she gasped even while I was busy removing my pants, which was all the invitation I needed before plunging myself into her depths, her strained cry of pleasure mixing with my groan of appreciation, and I started slamming into her mercilessly. “It hurts,” she managed to gasp between her cries, warning me to go slower. However, I was caught in a daze, and knew that slowing down was not an option for me. Luckily, I had other options. I flared my mana, not bothering to be conservative as I flooded her body with biomancy-based healing energies, deadening her sense of pain while curing the damage my merciless assault was creating. An extremely wasteful approach, but not without its benefits. And I had mana to spare. </p><p>[-50 Mana]</p><p>“Better?” I asked even as I sped my assault even further, the sound of flesh hitting flesh reaching a deafening point. </p><p>“Are you using-” she started, but interrupted by a moan when I started mauling her tits mercilessly. “Are you using your healing magic to deaden the impact? How?” she managed to slur, showing a great display of willpower. </p><p>“It’s not that difficult,” I answered, deciding to indulge her in a sudden hint of amusement. I was impressed that she was still able to think about the intricacies of magic while being stuffed mercilessly. And maybe focusing on a different thing would help me to combat the sense of arousal I was feeling, which was rather scary. “Actually, I’m basing the flow on one of your theories for arcana, but changing the energy flows…” I started, and launched a detailed explanation of theory even as I continued to drill her mercilessly. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 16%]</p><p>The notification managed to surprise me, because it only appeared after I started explaining to her about magic. Another clue, I realized, though it didn’t match the previous time. Then, I wasn’t helping her with magical theory…</p><p>But that time, I had just finished helping her level up! “It’s so simple,” I murmured in shock. </p><p>“What’s so simple?” she answered, or more accurately, she managed to slur certain parts of that sentence while I managed to piece together the rest. Her pleasure had risen to a point to prevent her from speaking coherently. </p><p>“Just reached an epiphany, give me a moment,” I answered, punctuating my sentence with a spank. She just moaned in lieu of an answer, leaving me free to focus my thoughts while I pumped her towards an orgasm. I realized that the companion process was about proving myself to them based on their perception, though as usual, I needed to seal it with a sexual process. It was pure physical domination for Aviada, and exemplar magical theory for Helga. Also, I couldn’t discount the fact that I saved Aviada from her fiancee, and helped Helga to level up, therefore removing their biggest problems. Maybe it was a combination of both. I needed to help them, and impress them… It certainly explained why I hadn’t received anything for Marianne despite the time we spent together. </p><p>With the next target of experimentation selected, I turned my attention to Helga, who was showing the signs of an impending explosive orgasm. I grabbed her hair, pulling her into a searing kiss, which triggered her orgasm immediately. I didn’t delay it, because she deserved a reward. Not only was she very helpful to get rid of the effects I had been suffering under, but she also unknowingly allowed me to mostly solve the issue of the companion process. </p><p>I pulled out of her, and she collapsed on the floor, her trembling legs unable to hold her weight. She was barely able to twist so that she was resting with her back against the wall, trying to control her trembles. As another part of her reward, I gave her a minute to calm down before ordering her to open her mouth. She did so immediately, and I invaded her throat, no less merciless than my earlier invasion. I let the healing magic fill her body once more. However, even as I invaded her I was explaining the flow of magic and theory behind it with great detail, amused by her struggle to decide what to focus on, the pleasure she was feeling, or the intellectual opportunity in front of her. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 19%]</p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 22%]</p><p>[+3 Arcana]</p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 25% - First Stage Completed +5000 Exp]</p><p>When the first stage was completed, her eyes widened with shock. After Aviada, I had a good idea of what she had just experienced. “Did you just receive an achievement?” I asked smugly, and her shock increased even further. I pulled out for a moment, letting her speak. </p><p>“How?” she murmured. </p><p>“It’s a dangerous secret,” I said even as I filled her mouth once more. “I’m trusting you with it, and soon, I’ll explain it, but don’t even mention it to anyone else,” I warned her, and she managed to nod despite her busy mouth. I wasn’t worried about it. Her look of fanaticism was hard to fake, not to mention I had the system’s approval about her increasing loyalty. With that aspect shelved satisfactorily, I continued ramming her throat until I filled her mouth with my seed, which she swallowed with great fervor. </p><p>I decided to sit down next to her, letting her rest against my chest in a rare moment of pure intimacy. She sighed in satisfaction. “By the way, rest well tonight. Tomorrow morning, we’re going on an expedition outside to increase your leveling speed further. Let’s see whether we can let you gain two levels in a week.” </p><p>Someone else would have claimed that I was mad for even daring to go out for hunting with less than a full regiment, not to mention my claim that I could help her level up with a speed that would rival a bonafide hero. It was proof of the impression I had on her when she, rather than arguing, just nodded with a smile and climbed on my lap, slowly riding me toward the climax. We stayed in the room for almost two hours, our bodies melding together in a variety of positions, mixing tender and fast, managing to squeeze several high-level theory discussions to the mix. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 45%]</p><p>[-356 Mana]</p><p>In the end, even with the generous application of healing energy, Helga was completely spent. Naturally, she lacked Aviada’s stamina, and magic was an imperfect replacement. Still, a huge smile was on her lips as she stumbled to her room, naked under her robe. I followed her until she reached her room of course, not wanting her to meet with a dangerous situation in her distracted state. Only when she was securely in her room did I walk away, but not to my room. </p><p>I wanted to receive my reward for helping Marianne in the library… </p><p><br></p><p>[Level: 13    Experience: 90800 / 91000 </p><p>Strength: 17    Charisma: 19</p><p>Precision: 12    Perception: 13</p><p>Agility: 14     Manipulation: 17</p><p>Speed: 12       Intelligence: 16</p><p>Endurance: 13      Wisdom: 18</p><p>HP: 884 / 884    Mana: 274 / 1079             ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>[Master Melee [68/100]</p><p>Expert Arcana [75/75]   </p><p>Advanced Subterfuge [50/50]         </p><p>Advanced Biomancy [50/50]        </p><p>Basic Speech [25/25]        ]</p>",

    "content": "<p>My shaft was doing its best to rival enchanted steel in its hardness while I examined the frustrated beauty trapped underneath. I wished that I had the ability to paint, because the mixture of emotions on her face was a sight to behold. There was resignation, anger, frustration, acceptance, and joy. Most importantly, above all, there was a burning need that left her nothing more than a toy to desire. “Tell me what you want,” I whispered throatily, still enjoying her surrender. </p><p>Her anger was a sight to behold. “I want you inside me, you bastard. And if you delay it any further, I promise that-” she said until her voice was suddenly cut off. The reason, the sudden presence of my shaft inside her, breaking through her barrier with one stiff move. My eyes widened in shock a bit, as I hadn’t been expecting her to be a virgin, not with her enthusiastic begging, but smiled with satisfaction, an expression she missed while her eyes stayed shut, trying to process the experience. </p><p>[+1000 Experience] 50% Penalty! </p><p>The grip of her walls was as tight as my hands around her wrists that pinned her on the ground. For another girl, I might have delayed the proceedings a bit, but her glare told me that any attempt to coddle her would have been met with a painful retaliation. So, I pushed forward sharply, earning a moan in response. It was a sharp moan, one that echoed in the forest, but both of us were too far gone to care about the consequences. </p><p>“Fuck me harder, you bastard,” she exclaimed, and like any gentleman, I picked up speed, invading her insides. </p><p>“Do you like it, you slut,” I said even as I let one of her hands go in favor of landing a slap on her dangling tits, one that earned a clear moan from her. However, despite her clear enjoyment, it almost turned into a big mistake, because her arm came swinging, and only my reflexes saved me from a punch that promised to be exceedingly powerful. “What the hell, you crazy bitch?” I said, but even as I said so, I was aware that I didn’t have any right to complain, as rather than pulling back, I started to impale her even deeper. </p><p>“You didn’t think I would just obediently allow you to have your way with me, right?” she said with a joyful smirk, her sentence interrupted twice by her moans. Despite the pain my intensified invasion clearly caused in her recently-virgin entrance, a fierce joy was the only thing I could see in her eyes. </p><p>“You are crazy,” I said, but even as I said that, I could feel my heartbeat picking up speed. It was impossible to deny the joy of pushing down such an amazing display of sexiness, each push creating another delicious contortion of pleasure even as she struggled. And the fact that even the smallest slip would result in a painful retaliation made the situation even more difficult, like I was riding an angry dragon, risking destruction with the smallest misstep. </p><p>And I liked it… It was an excellent change of pace from all the times I had shared with Helga and Marianne. Both were enjoyable, no doubt, but their obedience was starting to get monotonous. After experiencing Aviada’s rough ride, I was sure that I would appreciate Helga’s sincere lovemaking or Marianne’s obedient enjoyment a lot more. </p><p>But that momentary distraction proved to be a mistake, as I failed to react in a timely manner, when Aviada raised her head enough to reach my shoulder.</p><p>[-5 HP]</p><p>“You bit me!” I shouted, my loudness more about my shock than pain. Her biting was not a surprise, but I wasn’t expecting it to be hard enough to actually draw blood. Talk about violent sex. </p><p>“That should teach you not to get distracted,” she said, her expression the closest I had seen to pouting, though her bloodied lips added a violent edge to it. </p><p>“If that’s how you want to play,” I said as I leaned forward, my teeth clamping around her breast hard enough to leave a mark, earning a corresponding moan in response. And since she was clearly enjoying that part of the treatment, I started a barely-restrained assault on her body, biting and spanking even as I had done my best to ruin her entrance under my boundless pounding. Such a strategy wasn’t without a cost, of course, as whenever I let her hands go, she managed to extract a price, be it a painful scratch or even the occasional punch. But under my uninterrupted assault, her pleasure steadily built up, until the dam broke without a warning, and she turned into a shivering, moaning mess. </p><p>[+750 Experience] 50% Penalty! </p><p>Any other girl, I would have let her enjoy her first orgasm for a bit before starting the next round, but with Aviada’s usual attitude, pushing into the next stage was both safer and more fun. Pulling out for a moment, I grabbed her shoulder before flipping her into a position that had her chest was pressing against the ground. She gasped in shock when she realized what I was trying to do and tried to twist out, but her momentary delay gave me time to pull her arms to her back painfully, and grab them together, allowing me to keep her under control by just using one hand. I could have used my belt or a conjured rope to keep her occupied, but using my power and nothing else gave a clearer message. </p><p>“I’ll kill you,” she moaned when I started moving once more, my merciless pounding triggering her exhausted nerves once more. But despite her complaints, her enjoyment was clear, a chain of moans leaving her lips while I used my free hand to rain a formidable downpour of spanks, each harder than the last, coloring her bottom crimson, occasionally moving to her breasts for a painful squeeze. But the real joy started when I grabbed her hair, forcing her head back, giving me the perfect angle to invade her insides. </p><p>The sight of her sweaty body, glowing under the moonlight, her magnificent tits dangling freely, her tight ass turned crimson under my rough treatment… She was a luscious vision, and when she tightened around me a few minutes later in another orgasm, it managed to push me close to an explosion as well. “Damn, I’m cumming,” I moaned. </p><p>“Not inside!” she exclaimed, her panic clear even as she started to tremble with her orgasm. </p><p>Unfortunately for her, she was the one that turned it into a struggle of dominance, and I had no intention of allowing her to pull back. “Honey, you were the one that turned this into a battle. So unless you beg me mercy and admit to your weakness, the game goes on.” The mention of weakness was enough to stall her complaints for a moment, a stubborn expression appearing on her face. And a momentary stall was all I needed, because the next second, I exploded, filling her insides with my seed, intensifying her moan even further. </p><p>[+1000 Experience] 50% Penalty! </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 35%]</p><p>This time, I had no problems with letting her go, and she collapsed, barely able to turn enough that she was laying on her back, her chest rising repeatedly with her frantic breathing, adding another level of poetry to her vision. She looked enchanting with my marks all over her body, trying to process the rush of pleasure I just gave her to. Tempted, I leaned forward to capture her lips in a soft, lingering kiss. </p><p>Her expression of shock was simply too cute. She stayed passive under the soft caresses of my lips, the sudden intimacy catching her flat-footed more than my other actions. A fleeting, vulnerable expression appeared on her face, a cute one even though I would never dare to say that out loud. I had a feeling that she would react violently to such a claim. I let my hands drift over her body, this time, my touch fleeting and gentle as my fingers danced along her curves. Her lips started to respond, slowly and hesitantly at first, but soon, her enthusiasm passed even mine, our tongues in an enthusiastic battle. </p><p>Then, her movements slowly changed, obviously planning for something. I was curious enough to act oblivious, and kind enough to act shocked when she pinned my arms to the side while she climbed over me in a mirror of the first position. “It’s payback time, you bastard,” she threatened, but unfortunately for her, my sight was sharp enough to catch her intensifying blush. I made sure to put up a token struggle while she smirked, trying to seem threatening, but only coming across as excited and aroused. Then, before I could say anything, she lowered herself to my shaft, engulfing me with her presence once more, and started to ride me wildly. </p><p>I did nothing even when her grip around my wrists weakened under the rush of pleasure, giving me the opportunity to escape. Why should I, when the sensation of being ridden filled me with pleasure, while giving Aviada the win she desperately needed? It was clear that she wanted the struggle, and even though she knew I was stronger, she still wanted to be strong enough to get the occasional win. </p><p>Maybe I should bring her to my leveling trips. With her addition and my recent power-up -not to mention the level I was about to receive- we would be strong enough to form a hunting party, potentially with much stronger rewards. But that was a discussion point for another time, I decided, when I saw her face contorted with pleasure, indicating that she was already building up to another orgasm. And since my earlier surrender was sufficient for a freebie, I chose that moment to slip out of her grip. My legs wrapped around her while I hugged her. I rolled, and she was trapped between my body and the ground. </p><p>I didn’t bother to immobilize her arms, her fingers digging into my back to add a dash of pain to my pleasure. After all, not only did I have HP to spare, but I also had the healing spells to cure myself if she went too far. Indulging her was a small sacrifice while I pinned her on the ground under my weight, drilling her mercilessly… The position lasted for around twenty minutes, and ended predictably, with my seed filling her once more. </p><p>[+1000 Experience] 50% Penalty! </p><p>Level UP!</p><p>[Select one of the following skills: Master Melee, Basic Ranged, Basic Tactics] </p><p>I was tempted to get tactics with my upcoming expedition, but I was acutely aware that our team would be extremely small, and I would be the pillar. The individual capability would have been much more useful, so I chose to enhance my melee capabilities. And with that momentary distraction gone, I leaned forward once more.</p><p>“Again?” she murmured dazedly. </p><p>“Don’t you want to see who has the better stamina,” I said, and the mention of competition was enough to awaken her from her daze, our lips connecting with an unmatched passion. It was sunrise when we finally stumbled out of the forest, though the only reason Aviada was able to walk was my healing spells. I was the victor of our little endurance challenge, something she found hard to be dissatisfied with after an endless number of orgasms she had experienced on the way. </p><p>[+5000 Experience] 50% Penalty! </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 45%]</p><p>[Achievement: Endless Endurance.

The rewards I gained were impressive, but it was nothing compared to the pleasure I earned in the process. </p><p>“When are we going to meet again?” she asked even though she had a blush on her face. </p><p>“How about tomorrow evening,” I said, and she nodded enthusiastically. “Actually, I’m planning to make a small expedition to outside tomorrow morning, to see what I could hunt, would you be interested?” I added, acting like I just thought of that. </p><p>“Of course,” she answered, and after one last kiss, she walked away, the sway of her hips enough to tempt me for another round if I already hadn’t been exhausted to the limit. </p><p><br></p><p>     *****     *****     *****     *****     *****</p><p><br></p><p>I had thought that after spending the whole night with Aviada, leaving only an hour to nap before I had to dress in my robes and start working at the library would have left me exhausted, but on the contrary, I was bursting with energy. Maybe it was about my new level, or maybe I was underestimating the impact of a three-point increase in my endurance. Regardless of the reason, it didn’t change the fact that after a bit of drudgery work, I was feeling randy again. Not enough to make me drop everything and search for Helga or Aviada, but enough to create a low-key annoyance. </p><p>Which was why when I saw Marianne walking toward the obscure part of the library, the decision to follow her was easy to make. I made sure to stay hidden, and soon, we were in a relatively obscure part of the library that held some obscure texts on healing, peripheral stuff that was rarely used, but still useful to someone trying to push for the mastery in the area of healing. Since she was in front of the shelves rather than walking around to catch my attention, it was obvious she was in the library for research purposes rather than to fool around, but that didn’t stop me from closing in unnoticed, until I was close enough for my breath to caress her skin.  </p><p>“Can I help you?” I whispered throatily, and she jerked in panic, turning her back, her lips ready for a shout she forced herself to swallow at the last moment when she noticed my identity. </p><p>“What the hell, Gaius,” she asked, her chest moving violently under her out of control breathing as she tried to keep her breathing controlled. </p><p>She was even worse at handling shock than I presumed, a poor ability in a Melius, even for a healer, as ambushes by creatures weren’t completely unheard of in the field, and such a delay might result in a total slaughter. I took a note to fix the issue later on, but for now I just needed to distract her a bit. “You’re spooked,” I said even as I pressed my hand to her chest, her heart thumping under my touch. And if that gave me an opportunity to cup her breast, it was completely incidental. “Take a deep breath,” I said even as I moved my hand a bit, enjoying the sensation of her rather spectacular breasts. </p><p>She looked like she was about to complain, but a glare from my end was enough to make her change her mind, proving that she was getting more obedient. She followed my directions for a minute before her breathing was back under control, and as panic slowly drained from her face, my hand started to wander around her chest, exploring her breasts over her robe. “Um, I’m better now,” she said hesitantly, pointing at my hand. Her meaning was clear. </p><p>Naturally, I ignored her wordless request, softly squeezing her breast instead, adding a small touch of magic to intensify her sensations. “So, what are you searching for?” I said, repeating my earlier question even as I explored her body, ignoring her rising panic. </p><p>[+50 Experience] 50% Penalty! </p><p>I was barely able to hold back a frown at the notification. I had been hoping her to be an even higher level, which, unfortunately wasn’t the case. I didn’t know whether Aviada or Marianne had a higher level, but even under the best of circumstances, it was clear that I wouldn’t be able to reach level twenty without leveling them further -or finding a new assistant. “Gaius, what if-” she tried to start, trying to warn me about the risks, but I interrupted that by squeezing her breast hard, and she had to stop to prevent a moan from escaping. My earlier discoveries about her sensitive spots were coming in handy. </p><p>“I asked you a question, sweetie,” I said even as I took a step forward. She tried to retreat, but pinned between my body and the shelf, my arms were enough to cut off her escape route. I was close enough for my breath to caress her lips. She licked her lips nervously, but it only made them more delicious. I leaned forward, and she tilted her head readily, but I waited without touching, and going as far as to pull back when she tried to close in, maintaining our sensual distance.</p><p>Soon, she realized that she had no option but to play along. “I was looking for alternative ways to establish healing fields,” she explained. “I feel like my current method is not working as well as I hoped.” </p><p>“Which method are you using?” I asked. </p><p>“I’m using a variant of the double-matrix reduction, but for some reason, my spells are destabilizing in a few minutes,” she explained, more to follow my order rather than believing I could help her. After all, what she mentioned was an advanced topic that belonged to the healing field. Of course, she didn’t know that I had a decent biomancy knowledge. </p><p>I just chuckled and waved my hand, and two books pulled themselves from the shelves and started floating in front of her. “I believe these two should help you abandon such inelegant methods,” I said with a wide smirk, enjoying the expression of shock on her face. “Now, about the reward…” I added, and before she could say anything, my lips closed over hers, enjoying the touch, my hands caressing her body adventurously. </p><p>Then, my sixth sense went haywire even worse than the time I had been attacked by the shadow wolf, but it wasn’t the sense of an impending assault. It felt more like the silence before the storm, a certain pressure that would doubtlessly ruin me in one wrong move. I pulled away from Marianne immediately. “Go to the corner and hide behind the shelves,” I whispered to her, my voice had never been more serious. She looked like she was about to argue, but another angry glare silenced her. </p><p>Marianne dashed away, and just in time, because not just a second later, the head librarian appeared around the corner in her usual calm demeanor on the surface, only my rather impressive wisdom allowing me to see that things weren’t as straightforward. Never in my life I was so glad to pick advanced subterfuge, because even under her casual gaze, I felt that my mask was being assaulted. Luckily, I had the necessary acting ability to cover it. </p><p>“Boy, follow me,” she said before continuing forward, not even bothering to check whether I was following. Why would she, when she ruled the library with an iron fist, so much that even rest of the faculty hadn’t dared to intrude her domain? It was unthinkable for a lowly assistant to actually dare to ignore her order.  </p><p>I followed, doing my best to maintain my mule persona, curiosity rising in me despite fear. It was the first excuse I had to interact with her, and I was curious about what kind of secrets I would be able to unearth… </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>[Level: 13    Experience: 84200 / 91000 </p><p>Strength: 17    Charisma: 19</p><p>Precision: 12    Perception: 11</p><p>Agility: 12     Manipulation: 17</p><p>Speed: 12       Intelligence: 16</p><p>Endurance: 13      Wisdom: 18</p><p>HP: 858 / 858    Mana: 658 / 1053             ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>[Master Melee [68/100]</p><p>Expert Arcana [72/75]   </p><p>Advanced Subterfuge [50/50]         </p><p>Advanced Biomancy [50/50]        </p><p>Basic Speech [25/25]        ]</p>",

    "content": "<p>Caught in the excitement of testing my enhanced abilities, I failed to properly manage my time, so I failed to find time to change my clothes before meeting Aviada. I wasn’t too worried though, as Aviada wasn’t the kind of girl that would be turned off by a bit of monster blood, or care about the cuts from an extended battle. </p><p>Sneaking through the guards of the second forest hadn’t posed any challenge since, as usual, they were much more interested in movements in the forest rather than students that were trying to sneak in; since it was a pointless activity for the most. A minute later, I arrived at the promised location of the meeting, a small, obscure waterfall that most people avoided, because a lot of monsters tended to visit for a drink of water, meaning, there was no guarantee about the number of creatures that would be present. But I wasn’t afraid of even the most dangerous creature in the second forest. Also, I had confidence in Aviada’s skills to at least retreat without significant loss if she faced truly overwhelming odds, especially with the help of her impressive magical sword. </p><p>“You’re late,” said a familiar voice even as I saw a familiar figure charging forward, her sword ready to deliver a deadly blow, but the wide smile on her face was enough to tell me that it was just a friendly greeting. I turned and swung my arm, my sword already in hand, just in time to intercept Aviada’s impressive swing, magic crackling around my weapon to prevent damage from her formidable sword. Her eyes widened in shock as rather than pushing me back, her sword bounced. </p><p>“Hello, beautiful,” I said as I counter-attacked with an obvious blow just to create some distance. </p><p>“How,” she murmured in shock even as she pulled back, which was understandable, because the only thing that allowed me to resist her during our last encounter was my superior mobility, deflecting and dodging. Now, I was able to push her back through sheer power. </p><p>“Let’s just say I had a very fortunate encounter, with a nifty achievement as a result,” I said, basically blaming the sudden boost to a single extraordinary achievement, which was much more believable than getting a few levels and several achievements since our last encounter. “So, do you dare to help me test my new strength, or would you like to do something easier,” I smirked, happy to see challenge creating a flame in her eyes, her raven hair circling her face beautifully. </p><p>“Oh, I can handle whatever you can dish,” she answered before swinging her sword once more, and then things devolved into a delicious duel, where she tried trick after trick, only to fail repeatedly. After all, it wasn’t just my stats that had increased significantly since our last encounter. My melee capabilities had also gone through a significant transformation, so, in the end, I was able to handle her attacks through skill rather than brawn. </p><p>Defending myself was a monotonous task, allowing me to turn my attention to her spectacular body. She was starting to show the first signs of exhaustion, sweaty, out of breath, with a couple of shallow cuts I delivered as a warning when she tried particularly dangerous maneuvers. But her condition wasn’t the thing I focused on. No, that distinction belonged to the way she dressed. She wore a cotton tunic that didn’t bare even a hint of cleavage, but that wasn’t important, not when it was a size too small, its elasticity allowing her to display her voluptuous contours, her spectacular body getting more and more visible through her sweat. Unfortunately, her pants weren’t as fun, making me rather enthusiastic about peeling them off. </p><p>But soon, my attention was pulled to her face once more. The expression of concentration on her face was understandable because she was trying to get the best of the learning opportunity, but admirable at the same time because a lot of people wallow in jealousy against such a rapid development rather than taking advantage of the situation. I approved, though not as much as the other emotion I managed to catch on her face. </p><p>A thick layer of arousal. </p><p>Her getting excited while fighting was not a surprise, after all, our last playful spar where she was more than happy about me using a blade to peel of her clothes was evidence enough. But even when she was almost naked, she didn’t have such a thick layer of arousal on her face. A sudden suspicion appeared in my mind, and I increased the intensity of my assault, taking the initiative rather than allowing her to attack at her own pace, killing her assaults the moment of inception. </p><p>And her arousal increased with my dominance. Apparently, the respect she had toward martial strength was more primal than I expected. </p><p>I smirked with desire, as that particular detail quickened my plans significantly. “I think that’s enough for the warm-up,” I said lazily even as I swung the sword with my full power, opening her guard completely, the perfect opportunity to deliver a killing blow, but chose to take a step back. </p><p>“Warm-up…” she echoed in shock, a part of her outrageous because she was obviously doing her best, but her arousal increased even further just by the suggestion that I wasn’t using my full power. </p><p>“You know what,” I said as I suddenly pushed my sword into the ground, and picked up a piece of wood instead. “Maybe this will be fairer.” </p><p>“You’re playing with fire,” she growled in a way one might mistake for outrage. It wouldn’t be completely inaccurate, as she was actually insulted at the suggestion that I could handle her without a proper weapon, but the desire was hidden underneath, promising me everything if I could actually back my bragging. </p><p>“Then let’s see if I’m good enough to extinguish that fire,” I said with a smirk, before continuing with a more serious expression. “You just need to say I surrender, and I’ll stop. Clear?” I added, giving her an intentional out, with the full awareness that her pride wouldn’t allow her to utter those words for anything that I had in mind. </p><p>“Come at-” she started, but I didn’t give her an opportunity to finish her words, charging forward. Even when caught by surprise, she managed to raise her sword to parry. Just like that, I lost a part of my weapon, but a blow wasn’t my intention in any case. I grabbed her shirt instead, trying to turn the battle into a close-range struggle that she wouldn’t be able to leverage her sword efficiently. She swung her sword, forcing me to pull back. I did so, but I wasn’t dismayed, because a large patch of her shirt stayed in my hand, leaving her arm and shoulder bare, with the slightest hint of cleavage. </p><p>[+100 Experience] 50% Penalty! </p><p>[+1 Melee]</p><p>The proof of her low level was not the most welcome detail, but not a surprise either, not when I was able to dominate her with such apparent ease. When she decided to attack, I abandoned the implications of her low level, and focused my aggressive defense instead. I ducked under her sword before dashing forward, close enough that I was able to slap her bottom explosively, enough to make her gasp. “You’re dead!” she exclaimed, but paradoxically, respect and arousal colored her tone rather than anger. </p><p>“If you think so, apprentice,” I countered before dodging another assault, and taking tearing another piece of fabric in the process, this time rewarded by an unobstructed view of her flat bell. Then, we fell into a routine, she attacked, I deflected or dodged -occasionally acquiring a new stick when the previous one had fallen into pieces. It was hard to maintain its durability even with the liberal magic usage. A random piece of wood wasn’t the best magical conduit. </p><p>Still, even with the substandard equipment, I was still smiling brightly ten minutes into the spar while my opponent’s attacks were getting more and more furious, a demeanor contrasted greatly by the way excitement filled her face, ignoring her nakedness. And what nakedness it was! Her top was gone for all effective purposes, the few remaining scraps failing to cover her spectacular breasts as they tumbled with her every assault. Her pants were in a better condition, but only relatively. They were still ripped enough to give a full view of her underwear, a little black sexy piece that contrasted greatly with the rest of her practical outfit. Apparently, I wasn’t the only one with expectations about the later part of the night. </p><p>[+600 Experience] 50% Penalty! </p><p>[-45 Mana]</p><p>But it was enough for a game, I decided, and when I dodged her assault the next time, I grabbed her wrist instead of trying to rip her clothes, twisting her wrist to force her to drop her sword. She tried to resist despite her pained cry, looking at me balefully, but the important thing was her arousal hadn’t dimmed, even by a sliver. I squeezed harder, enough to threaten a break, and finally she dropped her sword, but instantly followed up with a punch, trying to turn it into an unarmed brawl. </p><p>I let her wrist go, because just with a punch, I could see that her skills didn’t include unarmed abilities unlike my generic melee skill. I didn’t even bother to throw a punch, just landed a playful squeeze on her breast before slapping her attack away. Her kick resulted in further loss of fabric from her pants, and then she followed up with a body-slam in an attempt to turn our brawl into a grappling match, where she could use her strength as an equalizer. </p><p>I let her succeed. Her eyes widened in shock as our bodies collided, but not as much as when she found herself on the ground, with her arms locked behind her back, her legs immobilized by the strategic placement of my leg. I slowly leaned forward, pressing my shaft against her ass, which lacked protection other than the scraps of her pants, and the deficient cover of her panties. “Are you going to surrender?” I whispered into her ear throatily. </p><p>[+2 Melee]</p><p>“Never,” she bellowed as she struggled, but it wasn’t a desperate struggle to get free, but an attempt to rub herself against the presence of my shaft pressing against her bottom. She was truly aroused. </p><p>“Really,” I whispered even as I used a spell to remove my clothes without letting her go. When I leaned on her once more, it was my naked shaft that pressed against her ass, her panties a poor tool to insulate against it. “How about now!” </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 1%]</p><p>While the presence of the notification had surprised me, making me even more curious about its reason and possible implications, it was hard to focus on that particular detail while Aviada was loudly declaring her intention to fight until the delicious end. “I can handle everything you can dish out,” she exclaimed. </p><p>“Everything?” I countered, using a throaty whisper, enough to make her shiver. I started removing the remaining pieces of her pants, ripping them off with an agonizing calmness. Whenever the sound of the tearing fabric reached her ear, she shivered, lasting until only her panties remained on her body. Her little lacy panties, too thin to hide her juicy arousal. I grabbed the edge of it, and her back arched in preparation, her bottom rising to give me even better access. But I just chuckled, and let my fingers move up instead, tracing alongside her spine leisurely. “Still not surrendering?” I asked. </p><p>“Never,” she said, trying to replicate her earlier determination, but it was an imperfect copy with desire filling her tone. </p><p>“I wonder how long you will be able to last,” I repeated, one of my hands still firmly locking her hands, while the other slowly moved over her skin, leaving only shivers behind, while aiming for her spectacular breasts, busy dangling naked. She did nothing other than moaning obediently when my fingers sank into her breasts mercilessly with a sudden change of pace, pleasure her only response as I mauled her flesh aggressively. But when I pulled my hand away without a warning and returned to my gentle caresses, her gasp of outrage was a thing of legends. </p><p>“You’re playing with fire,” she warned even as she tried to push her hips back, trying to feel my shaft between her cheeks. I let her succeed for a moment, and her hips started to dance furiously, trying to push herself into an orgasm. I pulled back after a minute,  just as she was starting to get closer to an orgasm. </p><p>“Such a naughty girl,” I said while pulling back, my free hand sliding through her raven hair with a surprisingly gentle caress, contrasting greatly with her increasing struggle. When I delivered another spank as a warning, she only moaned with a desire for more. “Any thoughts about surrendering yet?” I asked again, reminding her that she had only one option to receive what she desired. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 3%]</p><p>[+700 Experience] 50% Penalty! </p><p>“Not a chance in hell,” she exclaimed, but even if I lacked the ability to detect her wavering commitment, the system notifications would be enough to save me from that particular mistake. She was on the edge of surrender, her pride rapidly losing importance. The reason for it was clear. Not only I had saved her life three times, but also I had also proved to her that even in her selected field of expertise, I was far superior. And to top it all off, I showed that I was more than willing to help her get stronger as well, another attractive offer as she clearly lacked a support structure of her own. </p><p>I could just rip her panties and have her, and the only thing I would receive would have been a moan of pleasure, but I wanted more. I want her to surrender herself to me, so I extended the unique torture she was suffering under, her unmet orgasm taking an increasingly bigger toll as the time passed. I caressed, licked, and occasionally bit her sensitive spots, until she started to rely on words less and less, showing her intentions through gasps, moans, and desperate attempts of rubbing our bodies together. </p><p>“Come on, sweetie, is it really that difficult to surrender,” I murmured gently even as I finally grabbed the edge of her panties, and peeled them off with torturous slowness, finally leaving her folds naked. I brought my fingers to her wetness, finally touching her most sensitive spot, but her moans came unbidden, her heart filled with the remainders of desire and arousal. Her voice was deliciously tempting as she yearned for an explosion, but I just continued gently caressing while she tried to push back, doing her best to take in my erect shaft, which I occasionally dragged over her naked ass just to tease her. </p><p>Her enjoyment was evident in her delicious moan under my touch. She clearly wanted my presence as much as I wanted to hide my shaft in her body. And after the small game I had set up, I needed her surrender before moving forward. That was why I dragged my shaft against her entrance, just enough to wet the crown between her lips, but not pushing forward. She suddenly threw herself back, trying to skewer herself, but I was much more agile than her, and pulled back just in time. </p><p>“You lack the strength to push through my grip, you need to get stronger,” I said even as I spanked her bottom, watching the ripples with great interest, curious how she would react when her biggest advantage was assessed and found wanting. “Let’s see if we can train it.” And just like that, a new game started where I still kept her pinned while teasing her entrance, challenging her to push back. Ultimately, it was a delicious play I managed to enjoy only because I had an earlier encounter with Helga, taking the edge off the extended play. Aviada struggled, trying to achieve victory, but her attempts fell short, and I watched the counter for [Companion Acquisition] climbing up point by point. </p><p>[+1000 Experience] 50% Penalty! </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 25% - First Stage Completed +5000 Exp]</p><p>[+2 Melee]</p><p>“Excellent, a new achievement!” she moaned with pure joy, her frustration replaced with pride immediately as she renewed her struggle with a refreshed attitude. The reason for her mood increase was clear, because I could feel she had just received an impressive boost.</p><p>It didn’t take a genius to realize she had a strength-based achievement, one that put her strength quite a bit over mine. At least three points, maybe even four, I reasoned, because even from her disadvantageous position, she was on the verge of getting free, forcing me to apply an impressive range of tricks to keep her pinned. She thrashed, cursed, and moaned, but in the end, she ended up pinned on the ground, spread-eagle, with me directly on top of her, a very volatile position that made me doubt my ability to keep her pinned.</p><p>Then the system came to my rescue. </p><p>[Achievement: Struggling Strength.

But even as the joy of victory disappeared, arousal and desire remained. “I surrender,” she whispered in sweet defeat. She wasn’t able to say anything else, because my lips were over hers. </p><p>I was victorious.

    "content": "<p>It had been three months since the bet, and life had never been so good for me. There were times I had earned more, and there were times I had been hanging around with some spectacular women, but rarely had it happened at the same time because the former usually consumed my full time, leaving little opportunity for the latter. But now, stuck in the backwater town I had been sent to in hopes of forcing my resignation, I found myself in a rare comfortable situation. </p><p>I wasn’t just lazing around and enjoying sex, of course. I had arranged several deals for the plant I had been working for by leveraging the old-boys network, occasionally even stealing work from the other plants. It might have damaged the overall company interest, but it beefed up the numbers of our plant, so it was all well. Of course, thanks to another small contract I had signed with Natalie using a shell corporation, each deal was netting me some nice pocket change. I hadn’t even forced her to sign that particular one despite its relative illegality, as she had done much shadier things already. What was another small indiscretion? Ultimately, the numbers for the plant recovered significantly, which was the most important thing. </p><p>Even better, since on paper Natalie was still the general manager, it meant that she was responsible for dealing with all the pesky details like paperwork, delivery schedules, delays, and the other boring stuff, while I just traveled around, having expensive dinners with prospective clients and suppliers. In the office, I had nothing to do… Of course, I never liked laziness, so I usually found something to pass the time. One of these pastimes was currently under my desk, her raven hair sprawled over my lap as she did her best to bring me to a rapid climax. </p><p>Seeing my boss under my desk trying to bring me into a climax hadn’t lost its luster yet, maybe because even after months of routine, Natalie looked at me with a fire burning in her eyes. The impotent kind, because no matter how much she hated her submissive position, too many metaphorical chains were wrapped around her for her to even think about trying to cut herself free. Her financial indistrections was not even important at this point, even though they were big enough to ruin her career. She knew that I was the architect of her recent success, with a button to destroy everything I had built. That was the nice thing about deals brought in by a network, they were just as easy to destroy. </p><p>But even that wasn’t the biggest hold I had over her, I thought with amusement even as I exploded into her mouth, and she caught the result with practiced ease — I had been using our bet to the maximum effect for the last three months, turning our meetings into little romping sessions, occasionally even inviting Brenda to our little office games. Then, I received a message from Brenda, and smiled in amusement. Jenny was here. If I was a nicer man, I would have warned Natalie so that she could get under the desk. But I wasn’t, so I just wrote back to Brenda, telling her to inform Jenny that she could just walk in. </p><p>I was ready when the door opened and Jenny’s cheerful voice rang. “Hi Nathan, are you excited for the holiday?” </p><p>“Of course,” I said even as I pulled my zipper and stood up, sending Natalie one amused glance before standing up, leaving her trapped under the desk. Natalie was angry, but it was a wave of impotent, resigned anger lacking a will to act, because it wasn’t the first time I left her trapped under my desk. During the first three months of our bet, she had found herself stuck in a number of compromising positions, some even with Jenny. At least this time, she was still wearing most of her clothes. </p><p>I walked toward Jenny, a smirk on my lips. I took the time to examine the exquisite view in front of me. She was wearing a loose white shirt that only left her forearms bare, though by keeping the top few buttons open, she had created a nice hint of cleavage. Her absolutely tiny shorts, on the other hand, left her legs bare, displaying their toned perfection to the world. It was a sight that tempted me to push her down and take her on the floor, ignoring everything else. Unfortunately, that wasn’t on the cards yet. “Oh, yes. With the plant surpassing all the targets, the headquarters arranged a spectacular retreat. We’re going to have some fun.”  </p><p>“You’re going to have some fun,” Jenny said with a sigh even as she put her fingers on her stomach, which was no longer completely flat, but showing a small bump. “No, you and Nat are going to have all the fun,” she pouted. “I can’t drink, I can’t party, I can’t even swim as much as I want,” she complained with a pout, but it was obviously a playful one, excitement blossoming the moment her fingers touched her stomach. </p><p>I just smirked as I pulled her shirt up a bit before laying a gentle kiss on her stomach. “For some reason, I don’t think you’re unhappy with the obligations,” I said, and then landed several more kisses. “You wouldn’t have this perfect glow otherwise.” </p><p>“You flatterer, this is all your fault,” she said with a giggle, pushing me away playfully, but I kept my arms around her waist playfully. “I was perfectly fine before you came poking around.” </p><p>A chuckle escaped my lips. “Is that so. Because I distinctly remember a certain redhead begging me to fill her so that she could get pregnant, but maybe it was a different one.” </p><p>“You better not dare,” Jenny answered with a mock warning, though her slap was a bit too hard to be entirely playful, a sign of her growing possessiveness. The last three months had been an interesting period, quite a bit different than I had been expecting. While my relationship with Natalie had been nothing more than a festival of debauchery during work -often leading to overtime, of course- at home, I found myself a part of a little twisted family, with Jenny determined to keep me in the loop for the baby. Though it was understandable, considering I was the father, and already told her that I was willing to have a limited role in their life, as long as they didn’t expect me to have sleepless nights. That part, they had to handle. </p><p>I leaned forward and captured Jenny’s lips hungrily, my hands caressing her body, especially focusing on her breasts which became even more spectacular under the effects of her pregnancy. Her tongue readily met mine for a couple of minutes, before she pushed me back. “Natalie is not here,” Jenny said sharply, once again rebuffing my advances, but this time, it took more than two minutes for her to remember that particular detail, so I was making progress. </p><p>That was the only small annoyance for me during the last few months. After the fateful night, threesomes with Jenny and Natalie had become a weekly affair, usually starting with a homely dinner and turning into a night of debauchery. They were fun, especially after Natalie abandoned her delusions of being the dominant one in the bed, but Jenny was still adamant to keep our sexual interaction restricted to Natalie’s presence. Even warming her up for anything other than chaste kisses took some time. She claimed that anything else would have been cheating. Of course, I could have made Natalie convince her but I didn’t, mostly because slowly grinding her resistance down was much more fun. </p><p>“Are we ready to go?” she asked, trying to act nonchalant, but her hastened breathing and her blushed face suggested it was nothing more than a desperate attempt to change the topics. </p><p>“I am, but Natalie had an urgent meeting, so she had to change her flight for tomorrow morning,” I said in a sudden burst of inspiration, informing Jenny about an imaginary change of schedule. Also informing Natalie, who was still stuck under the desk, and had no option to come out unless she was willing to answer some pointed questions about her presence under my desk. </p><p>“Really,” Jenny said, disappointed. “But I already arranged everything. I don’t want to wait until tomorrow morning.” </p><p>“And we can’t,” I countered even as my hands were still wrapped around her waist, holding her tenderly. “Since it’s a work event, the company is paying for Natalie’s ticket change, but we have to pay from our pocket if we want to change to tomorrow’s flight. And it will just simply waste a night of pampering. It’s better if we just take the flight, and Natalie joins us tomorrow.” </p><p>“I don’t know…” Jenny murmured as she moved uncomfortably in my grip, but still stayed close. </p><p>“Don’t worry, I’ll be there to protect my little girl,” I said, once again leaning to kiss her belly. </p><p>“It’s going to be a boy,” she giggled, but her distraction was just what I needed. I dragged her out of the room, not even bothering to text Natalie about the changes. She was smart enough to understand her tasks from the snippets she heard. Unfortunately, while walking through the building, I had to stay away from her to avoid the gossip, but the moment we were in the elevator, my arms were around her waist once more. </p><p>“Nathan,” she murmured, the silent walk giving her time to realize the dangers of an early holiday. Understandable, because it wasn’t the lack of attraction that kept her away from me, but a misguided loyalty to her girlfriend, a loyalty that Natalie had never reciprocated even before my arrival on the scene. </p><p>“Honey, I’m the father of your child,” I said even as I pulled her even closer, putting a chaste kiss on her lips. “There’s no harm in us taking an earlier flight rather than wasting all that money. Natalie already agreed that it was the best idea.” </p><p>“I guess,” Jenny murmured after a brief consideration, her red hair creating an exquisite pattern as she shook her head. Then, she turned determinedly to me, and waved her finger warningly. “But there will be no sex before Natalie arrives! Clear?” </p><p>“Of course,” I lied. After all, the whole point of the scheme was to break her silly commitment. She looked a bit dissatisfied when I sealed the promise with another kiss, but only after I pulled back. She had no problem with our tongues battling while it lasted, nor when my hands slid down to cup her bottom. Unfortunately, the elevator ride was too short to do anything else. We maintained a light chatter as she took the passenger seat while I drove. It was a pity that asking for a little road head was not an option. </p><p>Things once again became interesting when we reached the counter to drop off our luggage, when the agent informed me that once again I was lucky enough to get an upgrade to first-class. “Good news, but you wouldn’t let my lady fly in economy, right?” I asked, pointedly putting my hand on her belly while I laid a gentle kiss on her cheek, making Jenny blush while the clerk giggled.</p><p>“Oh, I can’t do that to such a nice couple, especially when they are pregnant. How far along are you?” </p><p>“Three months,” Jenny managed to murmur, dipping her head, but still, a huge smile adorned her face, still unable to resist the temptation of cheering up when someone pointed out her pregnancy. Never one to miss such an obvious opportunity, I wrapped my arm around her waist, pulling her close. She hugged me back reflexively for a moment, creating the ideal picture of a happy couple. Then, I used the opportunity to sneak down and leave a playful grope on her bottom. “Cut it out,” she whispered, though anger was noticeably absent from her tone, just a playful frustration. After our weekly threesome sessions, a little grope only registered as impatient. </p><p>“Play along, or we will lose our nice first-class seats,” I reminded her, followed by a gentle kiss on her lips. She tried to look angry, but the giggle that escaped her lips readily ruined that image. With a sigh, she surrendered and left a sloppy kiss on my cheek, earning a cheerful smile from the agent while she processed our information and printed out our boarding passes. </p><p>We walked away from the desk, but I kept my arm around her waist, which she didn’t have any inclination to complain about if the way she leaned against me was any indicator. “There’s still time before the departure, should we drop by the lounge. Maybe we can drop by the spa?” I offered. “A massage would be good in your condition.” </p><p>“Not for me,” she murmured. “I never liked the spa. It feels weird when a stranger touches my body,” she answered.</p><p>“Who said anything about a stranger,” I said, my smirk widening as I caressed her back. “You know that I’m not a bad masseuse myself,” I added, my smile blooming as I remembered a few encounters where I had displayed my massage skills for her, though I hadn’t been able to do anything more than a preview with her inclination to jump in my bones the moment she started to feel aroused while Natalie watched helplessly from the side. </p><p>She looked indecisive, biting her lips as she considered the offer. But she also didn’t put up any resistance when I gently led her to the small massage room, leaving her in front of the dressing cabin. I would have liked to watch her undress, as seeing her naked body never lost its excitement, but I made a beeline for the employee responsible for the spa instead. A bit of fast-talk -and a generous tip- later, she allowed me to step into the massage cabin with Jenny despite it being highly irregular. </p><p>When I stepped into the room, Jenny was sprawled on the massage bed, on her back, her red hair contrasting with the white of the towel, which, unfortunately covered her torso completely. And as much as I would have liked to pull the towel off and seduce Jenny into a sexual encounter, it wasn’t realistic for two reasons. First, we didn’t have much time before the boarding, and second, Jenny was rather loud when she got started. I doubted that the walls would have survived her cries. </p><p>So, I was careful as my hands danced over her naked back at first, avoiding most of the sensitive spots. Instead, I focused on her spine and her upper back, earning soft gasps whenever I found a particularly annoying knot, the massage oil making the task even easier. </p><p>Of course, the vanilla version of the service was short lived. I was working on a clock, and neither missing the flight, nor cutting the massage before it reached to a level that satisfied me. So, my hands wandered down, focusing on the small of her back a bit, though I was rather careful considering her circumstances. Still, I stayed there for a while, until her attempts to keep her moans in start to fail. </p><p>At that point I moved even lower, knocking the towel that was covering her spectacular bottom to the side. “Nathan,” she said. </p><p>“Come on, honey, it’s not like I hadn’t seen it before,” I said even as my fingers dug into her bottom, attacking several sensitive points repeatedly. </p><p>“But-” she tried to say, only to fell into silence when my fingers passed dangerously close to her slit, which was starting to get wet. It was amusing to see just how easily her protests died under pleasure despite her earlier comments, stiffening in anticipation whenever I passed close to her wet lips. But despite her anticipation, I avoided the final contact. </p><p>Several minutes under the pressure of near-misses of pleasure, it only took the slightest push to make her turn, giving a full-frontal view of her beautiful body, glistening with a thin layer of sweat, tempting me to push for more. And I could see her that she was not too far away from agreeing to it. </p><p>Unfortunately, we had a plain to catch. </p><p>I leaned down slowly, aware that she was watching my every move. Her heartbeat thumped strongly under my fingers, signaling her excitement. I leaned further, and her lips parted open, ready for a kiss that would doubtlessly lead into more fun activities. It was a pity that we needed to board. “We need to catch the plane, princess, so get up,” I murmured, and placed a mocking, chaste kiss on her forehead before leaving the room. The last thing I heard as I closed the door was a frustrated growl. </p><p>I had to knock on the door a couple of times and remind her that we were about to miss the plane before Jenny walked out several minutes after me, with a glow on her face unrelated to her pregnancy. It was obvious that she tried to handle her burning need herself, but obviously failed due to lack of time. After months of non-stop high-intensity encounters, reaching a quick climax with just her hands was a challenge, especially when interrupted several times by my reminders about the departure.</p><p>“Let’s go,” she said, trying her best to maintain a displeased frown, but I put my hand on the small of her back, gently caressing along her spine just like she liked. Already close to an orgasm, she shivered, biting her lips to prevent herself from moaning. She sent me an angry glare, but it was met with an amused smirk. “Let’s go,” she repeated as she grabbed my hand, dragging me along. I just chuckled. </p><p>With priority boarding, we easily passed the last checkpoint, walking into the first class cabin. My face shone with excitement. The first-class cabin was completely empty other than us and a stewardess, but it wasn’t the only reason for my smile. No, I smiled because the stewardess was rather familiar, though it had been a few months since our last encounter. </p><p>“Hi, Tanya,” I said with a smirk. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Stating that everything we had gone thought until now had been a warm-up had the nice effect of puncturing her little bubble of self-confidence, and she looked at me with a dash of fear. “Let’s see how you handle a real challenge. I want you to rest your hand on the edge of the couch, acting like you’re alone and deep in thought.” </p><p>“I can do that,” she said rapidly while she walked the designated spot just as quickly, missing the fact that her bosom was doing a nice dance under the insufficient restraint of her fragile bra. She stood still, an exaggerated confusion on her face while she tried to follow my commands. She followed them without an issue when focused on cycling her through a few simple poses, she even obeyed silently when I asked her to slide her nightie to reveal her naked shoulder, though with quite a bit of delay. </p><p>“Not bad,” I said. “Now, I want your expression to look like you’re thinking about something naughty,” I directed. </p><p>That was enough to bring her insecurities back to the surface. “Naughty?” she repeated, gasping like she was being strangled. </p><p>“Yes, naughty. Kissing, licking, penetration, that kind of naughty,” I repeated mercilessly. I pushed hard, because I wanted her to be unbalanced for the next step. </p><p>“But-” she tried to interject, her panic blooming, but I cut her off. </p><p>“No buts. It’s an underwear catalog, and the idea of sexiness is a big part of the sale. I need to make sure you can reflect a sense of casual sexiness that would work well.” She looked no different than a little rabbit, caught in a trap. Unfortunately for her, she was getting advice from a hungry wolf. She nodded, and I continued. “Good, now, I want you to imagine yourself walking through a mall while wearing these exact clothes.” She immediately turned crimson. “No, no, no!” I cut in. “You look too shy, I want you to own your sexiness.” </p><p>“But-” she tried to interject once more, and once again, I interrupted her.</p><p>“No buts! One more but, and I stop,” I warned, making her nod rapidly, afraid of losing her opportunity. I continued with a kinder tone. “I  understand that it’s not easy to pinpoint the exact emotion I want for your first time, but you’re an actress, and I’m sure you can be successful if you focus on your job rather than a pesky sensation of shame.” </p><p>She nodded resolutely despite her blush, and did her best for the next few commands. She was decent, definitely not a natural model like Nicole, but still much better than the second-rate stuck ups I usually had to work with. It was probably all the acting classes she received. It was still insufficient for her to be anything more than an extra in a TV show, but it was sufficient for a photo set, especially since my clients weren’t particularly picky. She just needed to learn how to listen to my directions better. </p><p>And I had an excellent way to teach her that particular lesson. “Now, sit down on the seat,” I said after several more poses, and she followed instantly. That was the simple part. “Now, cross your legs, and put your hand close to your core, like you’re about to pleasure yourself, but I want you to look surprised, like you’ve been caught.” A blush invaded her face as expected. “Not that much. I want you to imagine that it’s your boyfriend that caught you. You’re a bit embarrassed, but you’re also horny, and you have no problem letting him know.” </p><p>She opened her mouth, no doubt to deliver the forbidden word, but I raised my empty hand warningly. She did the smart thing and made no noise. To her credit, she even tried to reflect the emotions I wanted her to do for the next minute, but, ultimately, she failed. I sighed exaggeratedly as I put the camera down, though she didn’t know that I had already turned it to video recording mode, the lens pointing at her direction. Panic appeared on her face as I stopped taking pictures, getting the wrong impression. “No, Stephen. Please give me another chance! Please! I can do it.” </p><p>“Relax,” I said as I walked toward her, and stood behind her while she was still sitting on the couch, She made an attempt to turn, but I put my hands on her shoulders, preventing her movement. “I can see that you’re still a bit stressed, and it’s understandable. I’m going to give you a massage so that you can relax,” I said even as I started rubbing her shoulders. She stiffened, which was understandable considering the forced intimacy she found herself in. </p><p>She turned her head to catch my face, unable to handle the sudden intimacy, but I just chuckled with a calm expression before gesturing her to turn back. “Do you think it’ll help?” she asked. </p><p>I answered instantly. “Definitely. From what I see, the biggest problem is you’re too self-conscious around me. You shouldn’t be, I’m just the photographer, and you should treat me as I don’t exist.” </p><p>“But, that’s impossible-” she answered before I silenced her once more, this time by pressing my finger on her lips.  </p><p>“What did I say about that infernal word,” I reminded her. She dipped her head, lacking the courage to confront me about my overreach, instead of dipping her head shyly. “Still, if you’re having trouble ignoring my presence, then, we have only one option. We’re going to make you comfortable with my presence.” </p><p>“How?” she answered even as I dashed away, and I came up with two more bottles of beer before she could even stand up from her seat.</p><p>“Simple, we’re going to sit and talk,” I replied as I passed one bottle to her, while sipping the other myself. </p><p>She let out a relaxed breath as she tried to stand up. “Okay, that’s perfect. Let me go and change.” </p><p>Her attempt to leave was prevented by my arm wrapping around her waist before pulling her back. I was hoping that the sudden movement would dislodge her bra, but this time, luck failed me. “There’s no need to change. The aim is to make you comfortable around me while dressed like this,” I reminded her. “And I have already seen you in it, what’s the harm if you continue to wear it.” </p><p>“I guess,” she murmured, but took a large sip to compensate. The second bottle of beer wasn’t enough to make her drunk, and it wasn’t my aim in the first place. I just wanted her to relax a bit before the next step. When I asked her a question about her previous acting experience, she immediately started a long monologue about some insignificant role she had on a short film, something she classified as a groundbreaking opportunity. I listened to her drivel, because the more she talked, the more excited she got . Though, the way her bosom tingled whenever she made an exaggerated motion paid a role on my patience as well. </p><p>In the throes of excitement, she barely reacted when I pulled one of her legs to my lap and started rubbing her soles. She tried to complain, of course, but those didn’t last long once I argued it would help her to relax, not to mention I was an expert when it came to massage. She continued her tale, and I ignored her slowly intensifying blush, this time little to do with her shyness. </p><p>“You seem much more relaxed, maybe we can give it another try,” I said, and she nodded excitedly. “However, one of the techniques you mentioned, method acting, was really interesting. Maybe we should try that first to make sure you’re ready for the real shoot.” </p><p>“Excellent idea,” she nodded, missing the implications of it in her excited state. Method acting required her to immerse herself in the role completely, and the role she was going to play was the naughty girlfriend trying to seduce her boyfriend after being caught in the midst of a naughty session. </p><p>“Good, then from now on, I expect you to act like a total professional no matter what happens. I’m going to play the boyfriend,” I said, which reminded her of the nature of the scene we were about to shoot. But it was too late. I put my hand on her thigh, dangerously close to her sensitive spot, and murmured. “Oh, honey. I wasn’t expecting to find you at home at this hour, or with such a surprise.” I dragged my hand across her legs. “Are these new, I have never seen them before?” </p><p>She looked like she was about to cut our little game short, so I sent her a sharp glare. “Yes,” she managed to stammer. “I bought it for you.” </p><p>“Such a nice girlfriend,” I said as I caressed her cheek suggestively. “But I interrupted you unfairly. Why don’t you finish it first before we can move onto the main event.” She failed to understand what I was driving at until I gently grabbed her wrist and led her hand to her core, her fingers resting on her panties. Her eyes grew in shock as she understood what I was driving at, but once again, she lacked the willpower to make me stop. “Continue,” I ordered, and her eyes closed while her fingers started dancing over her entrance, probing her lips over her panties. And I doubted the presence of her panties helped any due to the soft, almost nonexistent fabric. </p><p>“Excellent,” I whispered as I leaned forward, letting my breath to fall on her skin, adding a shiver to her stiff stance. I caressed her with my breath, but I avoided touching her at first, waiting for her to get in the mood. I watched as the occasional shiver broke her stiffness, and when her lips pressed with the determination of not making a sound even as her fingers caressed her soft spot gently. </p><p>The first moan she let out was a sign. I leaned down, and put a fleeting kiss on her neck. Her eyes popped open in shock, but once again, her arguments were prevented by a finger on her lips. “There’s no harm if a boyfriend kisses his sexy girlfriend once, right,” I murmured, waiting for her to nod before kissing her neck for a second time, this time for an extended duration. “Or twice.” I waited until another nod before landing another kiss. “Or thrice,” I added. For the fourth one, I didn’t bother waiting for her to say anything. Or the ones that followed it. </p><p>Her moans weren’t a surprise. I took them as an invitation to climb up, trailing her jawline with kisses, even her chin, but avoiding her lips despite them getting parted invitingly. Instead, I used the distraction to slowly untie her nightie. It might be sexy and transparent, but still, it was a barrier against my touch, therefore it was not welcome. Luckily, Penny was too distracted by the kisses landing around her lips to pay attention to such a small detail. </p><p>She only noticed it when my lips drifted down bypassing her neck to rain kisses on the edge of her breasts. I could see her watching worriedly, but arousal was also there. I decided to enhance the latter part without unduly raising the former, so I skipped her breasts temporarily and landed on her belly, kissing, licking, and blowing to my heart’s content. Her worry was still present, but it was helpless against her rising arousal, evidenced by the quickening dance of her fingers. </p><p>When I moved up to her breasts once more, I was accompanied by a string of moans rather than her disapproving gaze. Confident with my progress, I focused my attention to the valley between her breasts first, kissing, licking, and caressing to my heart’s content. Then, I started to move left, my kisses getting closer and closer to the center of her left breast, until I hovered above her nipple, erect enough to threaten to rip through the fragile fabric of her bra. I wrapped my lips around the nipple, not even bothering to push the fabric away, and put a gentle pressure behind my teeth. </p><p>“Yes!” she moaned in joy as the pleasure filled her, marking an opportunity to push to the next level. Pulling down the bra took no effort, as the poor thing was barely able to keep its position in the first place. My lips clamped around her nipples, this time without a barrier to reduce the impact, allowing my tongue to dance around the area my teeth softly marked. Penny just moaned more, probably already forgetting that it was supposed to be just an acting exercise. </p><p>Not one to miss such an opportunity, my fingers slid down until they were wrapped around her wrist once more. She didn’t even put up a token resistance when I led her fingers in her panties, bringing her self-pleasure to the next level as her panties strained to contain her hand. I wouldn’t bet on those panties to survive until the end. We continued like that for a while, with her fingers dancing over her core, while my hands gently explored her body and my lips attended her firm breasts.</p><p>I could guess that she wasn’t too far away from a climax, because she put up no resistance as I peeled her nightie off her completely, her body rising obediently to allow the light fabric to slide away from her body. Her bra would have suffered a similar fate, but I liked the view of it bunched under her chest, still present while failing to cover anything. It added a bit of color to her deliciously pale skin.</p><p>It was time to move onto the next step. Once again, my lips climbed upward, passing her neck after a gentle pause and arriving at the destination, her lips. They were already open invitingly, so I had no trouble slipping my tongue inside even as our lips were engaged in a gentle dance. She moaned, but my lips were in place to muffle her sound. Orgasm impending, she lacked the ability to resist my insidious assault, especially when my hands started exploring her body hungrily, learning every nook and cranny of her body. Her only reaction was her tongue wrapping around mine in an ineffectual display of arousal and desire. </p><p>She finally reacted when I grabbed the edge of her panties with the intention of pulling them down, trying to prevent me from doing so in a moment of lucidness, but that backfired. Her panties were too fragile to resist a tug-of-war and were torn with a sharp sound. Her hands found my shoulders, intending to push me off, but I turned up the intensity of the kiss at that moment. That shock stalled her for a moment, giving me the opportunity to take the place her fingers were busy at just a minute ago.</p><p> Unlike her, my fingers didn’t dally around her knob gently but slid in her entrance, bunched together to create an even more impactful penetration experience. “That’s too much,” she managed to murmur when I pulled back from the kiss in favor of watching her glorious body, but that was the only resistance she had been able to gather under the merciless pumping of my fingers, changing the pace of the dance completely. Her hands found my shoulders, but rather than trying to push me off, her fingers dug into my flesh hard enough to leave a mark. It was a pity that I couldn’t do the same for her, but unfortunately, I needed her skin to stay pristine. We had a long underwear session tomorrow. </p><p>I only pulled out my fingers when she collapsed into a shuddering mess, moaning my name deliriously. My shaft was throbbing, begging for a release, but unfortunately, I was not in a position to fulfill that particular need right now. Instead, I helped her to pull her nightie back on, its front haphazardly tied together, and dashed for my camera. “Smile,” I ordered her as I rapidly snapped several photos, and in her dazed state, she followed my commands for several minutes, creating a nice range of softcore photos, and a few that pushed the boundaries. </p><p>“Stephen, stop,” she murmured dazedly when she finally managed to beat the joy and excitement. A glance revealed just how much she was revealing. With her panties absent, only the way she crossed her legs as preventing her most intimate spot from being photographed. Her bra was still dislodged as well, and her transparent nightie was a bad choice to hide anything, especially something as attention-catching as her rather large bosom. </p><p>“Don’t worry, sweetie, these are just private reference photos, no one will see them except you and me,” I answered with a dark smirk. She looked like she was about to argue, so I chose to distract her with the good news. “If you don’t have anything to do tomorrow, we can take the underwear catalog tomorrow.” </p><p>“Really!” she exclaimed, though she hadn’t pulled her arms away. </p><p>“Yes, we’re going to do a full day shoot, so rest well tonight. Actually, you can just go upstairs and catch an afternoon nap if you want. I want you to be rested and ready tomorrow. It’s going to be a grueling day.” </p><p>“I won’t disappoint you!” she exclaimed as she jumped up her feet and she hugged me, though her excitement didn’t survive for long when she realized the exact way she had been dressed, and dashed away, giving me one last show of her plump bottom, free from the oppression of any kind of coverage, as she climbed the stairs, leaving me alone with a raging boner. I sighed and quickly gathered my equipment and put them in my car, my raging boner a source of supreme discomfort. </p><p>Luckily, I knew exactly where to go to get rid of that boner. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I couldn’t help but smile as I walked towards the dressing room, a sexy set of underwear in my hand, a black lacy set, unfortunately opaque. I would have liked to see Emma dressed in something even more courageous, hoping to trigger her sexuality, but I had a feeling that she would melt from shock if I dared to do so. I wasn’t even completely sure that the current one wouldn’t go amiss. </p><p>“W-what is this!” Emma exclaimed behind the door, confirming my earlier opinion. </p><p>“That’s the only thing that I was able to find fitting for your size,” I answered. “You’re rather stacked in the upstairs.” A gasp escaped her mouth, but I was quick to reassure her. “Don’t worry, that’s not a bad thing!” </p><p>The silence spreading from the dressing cabin was palpable, and I had to force myself from chuckling. “I can’t wear these,” she wailed. “They are too revealing.” </p><p>“Come on Emma, they are going to stay under your clothes, what difference does it make?” I said even as my mind churned plan after plan to get rid of those clothes. </p><p>“I don’t…” she murmured while I walked away before she could finish her sentence, leaving her alone in the cabin with the underwear I had picked, fully aware that she lacked the courage to walk around in a tight shirt and a cheerleader skirt. Of course, she could have just called for a saleswoman to help her, but that would have required her to call them and reject my ‘generous’ help; something impossible thanks to her crippling lack of confidence. </p><p>After leaving, I first went to the checkout counter, and quickly paid for a leather wallet for myself. It wasn’t that I needed a wallet, but it gave me the excuse to flash my fancy credit card, highlighting my means above a normal teenager, meaning the employees would be much more willing to turn their gazes away when I started acting my plan. After that, I went back to the cabin, with a pair of tight pants in my hands, too tight to contain Emma’s rather impressive bounty. “I picked some pants for you, I hope they fit,” I said as I passed it over the door. </p><p>She grabbed it immediately, only to whisper a second later while passing the pants back to me. “They don’t fit.” </p><p>“Sorry, I’m not good at guessing sizes. It would have been better if I had something to compare,” I replied, then snapped my fingers like I had a sudden idea. “I know, why don’t you pass your current clothes to me, and I can use them for comparison.” </p><p>“But-” she tried to argue, probably going to do the reasonable thing and just tell me her sizes, but I cut her off. Of course, a calmer mind would have just mentioned the fact that I was able to pick underwear for her size perfectly.  </p><p>“Come on, Emma, pass them to me. I don’t have all day,” I said in a sharper voice, tinged with a dash of annoyance. It wasn’t an angry tone, but a serious one, one that demanded respect and obedience. After all, in her mind, I was the one that helped her while she was suffering from a humiliating joke. I had no problems implying that she was pushing my patience. She whimpered, but still, she passed the small skirt and the tight shirt I had acquired for her, leaving her in her underwear only. </p><p>I walked in a leisure pace as I looked for a dress for her. The time was working for my benefit because every second she waited in the cabin in just her sexy underwear made her more comfortable with her revealing state. Not enough to give me a show of her underwear, of course, but enough to make her model in the dress I had picked for her. It wasn’t anything special, a dark green sundress with a reasonably long skirt, and loose enough hide some of her curves. Still, when I passed it to Emma, she gasped in shock, likely because of the loose cleavage on the chest area. </p><p>“Have you tried it yet,” I said, ignoring her gasp. </p><p>“Putting it on,” she answered. </p><p>“Okay, come out so I can see it as well,” I said, which earned another gasp from her. Just to put pressure on her, I started tapping my foot on the floor in a display of impatience, and the rustling of fabric sped up. It didn’t take long for the door to be opened, revealing Emma with all her glory. It didn’t take long for her to agree, as while the cleavage on the dress was a bit on the excessive side, it was still nothing compared to her tight shirt and non-existing underwear she walked into the shop with. </p><p>“How is it?” she managed to ask, her gaze strictly on the floor. </p><p>“You look beautiful,” I said, and immediately, she blushed deep enough to rival her hair. “However, the dress doesn’t fit with your complexion. Go back to the cabin, I’ll find a better one,” I said, and once again walked away without waiting for her response. In the next half an hour, the scene repeated itself numerous times, though the skirts get shorter and the tops got tighter as she slowly got used to the rhythm, and we even picked a few casual clothes on the way, though they were still way sexier than anything Emma would have picked in her own volition. Though I avoided anything truly sexy until I noticed a little black dress, tight and short, the kind that a sexy model would wear to a night club to make her sugar daddy happy. And I wanted to see it on Emma. </p><p>Unsurprisingly, I met with another gasp when I passed it to her. “I can’t wear this!” she exclaimed. “It’s far too revealing.” </p><p>“I’m just curious how it’ll enhance your beauty,” I answered. “We won’t buy it, but just put it on.” </p><p>“Okay,” she murmured after a brief silence. I smirked, happy to see that my efforts were paying off. “But it’s just…” </p><p>“I know,” I said, not waiting for her to finish her sentence. “But wearing that even in the dressing room only will help you with your confidence, and in turn, it’ll solve your bullying problem.” </p><p>“You think so?” she asked in a trembling voice, clearly unconvinced. </p><p>“Of course. If there’s one thing that bullies never deal with, it’s a confident target,” I explained, even though I knew it was half correct. Because while bullies would avoid a confident person, it wasn’t the case for the ones that they picked for their victim. For them, it would bring an intensified wave of torture, because their increasing confidence would be an attack on their dominance. Of course, that fit me just well, because I would be there to protect her from the increased assault, tying her to myself even further. </p><p>“Really?” she asked. </p><p>“Believe me. I’m not saying that they’re going to stop instantly, but less you react to their words, more difficult it would be harder for them to justify the effort they put in. And the knowledge that you’re much sexier than they ever will help immensely, I promise,” I explained with a confident tone, avoiding the fact that her increased confidence would just launch a new line of weaponized gossip about her sluttiness, especially when she would start to hang around me. </p><p>“Really,” she murmured in fascination, and after my affirmation, she continued. “Okay, I’ll give a try.” Still, after a while, her shy whisper reached my ears. “Rodnick, I can’t wear it.” </p><p>“Don’t tell me that it doesn’t fit,” I answered to her in a fake shock. “But I made sure that the size is perfect for you,” I added in disappointment, trying to evoke her pity.  </p><p>“That’s not the problem!” she quickly answered, ready to console her white knight. “It’s just that … it’s too sexy…” </p><p>“I think you need a second opinion,” I said as I pushed the door open, only for her to freeze, because apparently, instead of trying the dress on, she was holding it against her chest, meaning I had a direct view of her underwear-clad body. And that view was spectacular; the fragility of the bra struggling to keep her bosom under control, her panties hugging her hips hungrily. “Sorry, I thought the dress was on you already,” I explained, but I kept my gaze on her body. She stayed frozen, except a full-body blush invading her body. I closed the door, but very slowly, giving my gaze time to dance over her body for one last time. </p><p>A more confident girl would have responded in cries, or at least, requested a different dress frostily, but Emma lacked the confidence to take such a confrontational stance, especially after all the help she received from me, unaware of my plans. And the crush she was obviously developing for my ‘heroic actions’ made it even more difficult for her to push back in any form. Instead, she stayed silent for a while while I apologized repeatedly, mixed with a generous dash of compliments telling her that she had nothing to be ashamed of. Still, she grabbed the pair of heeled shoes I had passed her. </p><p>Several minutes later, the door opened, and she stepped out, trying to balance herself on the unfamiliar shoes, wearing the little black dress I had picked for her. And she looked delicious, her legs going on for days, the skirt only starting a few inches below her waist, enough to reveal everything in one wrong move. The top was even better, its tight grip enhancing her cleavage further -though the presence of her bra reduced the impact quite a bit. After all, the dress was designed to be worn without it. </p><p>“You look beautiful,” I said, completely honest. The blackness of the dress was contrasting with her pale skin perfectly, and her crimson hair spilling on her shoulders was reminiscent of a flame. </p><p>“T-thanks, I like it as well,” she murmured, unable to meet my gaze. “It’s a pity that I can’t wear it, or afford it,” she said.  </p><p>“Let me check,” I said as I moved forward to check the price tag, which was rather hefty, and ripped it off with a stiff pull. </p><p>“Why did you do that!” she said, panicked enough to suppress her shyness for the moment. “I can’t afford it-” she tried to continue, but I silenced her with a finger on her lips. </p><p>“Sorry about that, it was an accident,” I said with a shrug. “But since it was my mistake, let it be a gift for you.” </p><p>“That’s too much!” she argued as she waved her arm, missing the amazing impact her move had on her cleavage. “I can’t accept it.” </p><p>“How about if you paid me back later on,” I said. </p><p>“That’s better,” she said, relaxing a bit. “But you might need to wait for a while, because I first need to find a job. I can’t ask my mother that much money.” </p><p>I made a show of thinking. “How about if you tutor me in sciences, and we can agree on a rate that will drop from the total.” </p><p>“That might work,” she murmured. </p><p>“Excellent, a deal, then,” I said, putting my hand forward like I was about to shake her hand, but when she moved forward, I chose to hug her instead, her shocked gasp echoing in my ear. I kept the hug going for a while, enjoying the way her curves pressed against my body before letting her go, leaving her crimson on the face. She dashed back to the dressing cabin immediately. When she came out, she was wearing a tight pair of jeans, and a loose blue shirt, both the cheapest and the most conservative clothes from my pick. </p><p>Paying didn’t take much, though we received a few suggestive glances from the salespeople around us. I considered buying her more from the ones we had picked, but I had already pushed the situation quite a bit with the black dress, and didn’t want to risk it further. The trek to my car was silent while Emma tried to process the details of our shopping trip, sending occasional shy glances to my side, probably thinking that the recently-fallen cover of darkness would be enough to hide her expression. </p><p>“Are you hungry?” I said once we were in the car, and when she nodded, I took a turn toward the outskirts of the city. </p><p>“Where are we going?” she asked, for once her tone is not colored with shyness, replaced by worry. </p><p>“I have found a really good food truck toward the outskirts of the city, I’m sure it’s still open,” I explained even as I pressed on the pedal, and we soared through the road. </p><p>“No! We can’t go there!” she exclaimed even as she grabbed my arm, her fingers digging into my flesh hard enough to hurt. </p><p>“Why?” I asked even </p><p>“That part of the city is really dangerous in the night. There’s a lot of gang activity,” she explained rapidly. </p><p>I knew it wasn’t the gang activity that worried her, but a supernatural variety of danger, but I let that slide. “I’m sure I can handle it, but I don’t want to worry you,” I answered as I took a turn, and Emma let out a relaxed sigh, unaware that it put us into a route that ended up in a blind alley due to a collapsed building, nor that she knew about the small tribe of possessed that was on the hunt for more prey, which was why she looked shocked when we ended up looking a broken wall, and almost twenty people with blank faces and blanker eyes looking at us, armed with a variety of improvised weapons, from broken pieces of chairs to rusty iron bars. </p><p>“We need to run away, they are too many,” I said while Emma looked at the crowd, shocked, proving that just because she knew about the supernatural hadn’t meant that she would be able to react immediately on the face of danger. I dashed toward the passenger side, and grabbed her arm before dashing forward, dragging her along. </p><p>It wasn’t difficult to get away from the possessed even with Emma half-stumbling, slowing us down. The possessed were one of the least dangerous supernatural threats, because it took a while for the demon to get used to their new bodies. Not to mention they rarely took good care of their new bodies, further reducing their potential. Their advantage lay in numbers, and avoiding them was rather easy. After all, I picked their nest for a reason. </p><p>A minute later, we had holed up a small room two floors up an abandoned building, and Emma was breathing hard. “Damn, that’s a lot of addicts,” I said with a sigh before turning her, my expression resolute. I put my hand on her cheek. “I’m sorry to put you in danger, but I promise no harm will come to you,” I said, shamelessly stealing the role of a tragic hero. </p><p>“T-thanks,” Emma murmured, her blush suddenly back despite the danger. </p><p>“Should we call the police?” I suggested. </p><p>“They won’t respond,” she simply explained. “They are understaffed, so any call that comes from anywhere other than the rich districts are usually ignored. The best case is a delayed response that would arrive in an hour or so. But I’ll text for my friends, they are experienced in such things,” she added. I watched her as she quickly sent a message, though she kept her screen away so I wasn’t able to read what she sent. Not that I needed to while it was obvious that Allison was the recipient of the message. </p><p>“Is it done?” I asked.</p><p>“Yes. We should just stay hidden, my friends will be here quickly,” Emma said rapidly, her tone begging. </p><p>“I prefer to fight,” I said, and panic bloomed on her face. Before she could say anything, I caressed her cheek gently. “But I can’t risk your safety.” And just like that, a blush covered her face, evidence of a rapidly evolving crush. She simply didn’t have a chance at my treatment. But before she could say anything, I whispered harshly. “I hear someone getting close. We need to hide better.” </p><p>From her confused expression, it was clear that she hadn’t heard anything, but luckily for my ploys, she lacked the confidence to confront me. She followed obediently as I dragged her to a small room which once was a fitted wardrobe. The space was dusty and dirty, but more importantly, it was tight, something Emma only realized when she ended with her back against the wall and her chest against mine, with no room to wiggle. She tried to move nonetheless for a while before abandoning that path quickly. </p><p>The reason: her wiggling managed to awaken my shaft rather easily.  </p><p>“We just need to stay put and wait for help,” I whispered, struggling to hide my amused smirk. The wait was going to be fun… </p>",

    "content": "<p>At this point, a gentleman would have turned his back and walked away. Unfortunately for her, I was quite a bit away from being a gentleman, so I just ogled her while she sat on the floor, blushing furiously while trying to hide her body — with limited success. “Go away,” she exclaimed, but she kept her eyes strictly on the ground, too shocked to catch my eye. The confusion wasn’t helping her either. After all, she had just watched me construct a runic vessel from scratch, a task well-above anything she -or any of her rich friends- could manage on their own despite their fancy tutors and other advantages. Watching the supposed famous failure handling that in a few minutes must have been a true shock. </p><p>“I don’t think so. I”m happy with my position,” I answered, shamelessly ogling her mostly naked body. After all, she might be bitchy, but her lean body made a good eye candy, especially with her golden hair glistening under the morning sun. </p><p>“Go away,” she repeated, even going as far as raising her hand threateningly, and a bolt of mist gathered between her fingers, turning into a small icicle of ice. </p><p>“I see the effects of the bracelets are mostly gone,” I casually commented, easily ignoring the supposed threat she was trying to make. The bracelets’ residue still partially restricted her, severely curtailing her maximum power output, not that I would be afraid of her even in her full power. She frowned, unhappy with my dismissal, and released the icicle. It was obviously not dangerous, valuable only in its statement. So, I decided to greet it with a statement of my own, and let a wave of pure mana loose. It met with her attack halfway, evaporating her instantly. </p><p>“How?” she murmured, her eyes wide once more, and her shock was understandable. The way I had countered her attack was one of the most ineffective way possible, usually only possible when there was a great difference in power. Handling her attack effortlessly, even when her powers were restricted, proved that I was stronger than her even when she was without her handicap, showing that our difference was not only on skill, but on power as well. </p><p>I could have used that realization to intimidate her further, but after going all the trouble of saving her, I didn’t want to create an enemy. Instead, I let a crooked smile to appear on my face and spoke in a cheerful but even tone. “As I said, milady, there is quite a bit that you’re unaware. And maybe, I’ll tell you about them…” She stayed silent, struggling to process the situation. I gave her a minute to do so before continuing. “So, what’s the plan while I hunt for breakfast.” </p><p>“I’ll try to send a message back to my family, so that they can send a rescue team.” She stilled for a moment. “Of course, if that’s okay with you.” </p><p>“Sure, do that,” I answered. After all, even if her family had a team nearby, it’ll take a few days for them to arrive at our destination. And while watching her naked flustering was fun, I wasn’t planning to play the babysitter for long. I had a lot of things to do. </p><p>Lillian nodded and struggled to stand up, which was rather difficult while struggling to keep her assets hidden, especially since I was shameless enough to walk for a better angle whenever she turned. “Enough!” she exclaimed. “Will you stop it if I show you my boobs once more, you fucking animal,” she exclaimed exasperatedly, her earlier fear forgotten, which was half the reason I was messing with her. The other half was simply her sexy body. </p><p>“Deal,” I said, and watched as she blushed once more, realizing what she had just offered. It wasn’t the first time I would see her breasts, but since it was the first time she was going to reveal them consciously, she felt embarrassed. </p><p>I whistled in appreciation as she pulled her arms away for a moment, her gaze fixed on the floor. She stayed like that for three seconds before covering her breasts. “Satisfied!” she needled. </p><p>“Honestly, I can spend a day looking at your sexy body, and wouldn’t be satisfied,” I said, earning a shocked gasp. “But it’s enough for our deal. Then, without a warning, I pushed my pants down, followed by my underwear, revealing my body in full buff glory, especially since I was on full mast after her little show. “Payment for your consideration,” I said as I walked away, leaving her stiff in shock while I enjoyed the morning breeze on my naked skin. </p><p>I walked to the shore, leaving Lillian frozen, trying to process the enormity of her lapse of control along with my sudden nakedness. I was more than happy with her attitude. Whether it was the lack of familiarity with the environment, of the shock from being saved by me, her behavior was much more entertaining than her demeanor back in school, and was getting even better with each passing hour.  </p><p>The stressful escape was turning out to be an amusing holiday. Of course, it wasn’t without its annoyances, the biggest being the discomfort from carrying the small mysterious box on my palm, but I didn’t trust Lillian about not messing with clothes after all the tricks I had pulled on her. I wanted to see her play along, but I didn’t want her discovering the mysterious box in the process, so I chose the inconvenience of not using one of my hands while fishing instead. As I slid into the water, I could feel her mana flaring behind, but since I knew she was trying to build a communication array, I didn’t pay much attention to that. </p><p>I started cutting through the cold expanse of the water for some breakfast, but the sea was surprisingly sparse, so I swam forward, hoping to catch something big enough. But even then, I was barely able to catch enough to feed one person after several minutes of concentrated effort. The prey was sparse today…  </p><p>Too sparse, I realized suddenly and pulled to the surface and started swimming back to the shore. Something was wrong! </p><p>And confirming my suspicions, a shout reached to my ears almost immediately. A rather shrill, familiar one, but I never heard it colored with pure terror. I was already swimming towards the small island, my speed several times more than my natural speed, magic coursing through my muscles to quicken my movements. It consumed a decent chunk of mana, but it was worth it. Lillian was clearly in danger, and I had no intention of allowing her to die while she was under my protection. It was a matter of pride. </p><p>I was just stepping at the shore when Lillian appeared behind a tree, running away helplessly, her face contorted with terror. The reason appeared just a moment later. A dragon serpent! </p><p>“Fuck my luck,” I murmured. Luckily, despite their name, dragon serpents weren’t actually dragons, which was scant comfort. After all,  true Dragons threatened huge cities with their sheer presence and required armies to repel, and teams of legendary heroes to defeat. Dragon serpents were nothing compared to that. A disciplined squad of skilled mages could defeat them, without a casualty even if they were lucky. </p><p>Of course, that comparison did little to help me since I was curiously lacking a team of experienced mages for support. My only ally was a rich heiress whose magic hampered due to her imprisonment, making her rather useless. I didn’t have a weapon. I was even naked! At that moment, the thought of leaving her to her fate, and hoping that the creature would be satisfied after eating her was extremely tempting. </p><p>Then, a sudden thought appeared in my mind, and a burst of laughter escaped my mouth. I understood what grandfather meant when he claimed that pride was a man’s blessing and curse at the same time. It made a man die ignobly in a poorly-chosen battle, like trying to defeat a dragon serpent alone with no weapon. But he also claimed that only by climbing over a pile of impossible challenges, a man could rise to be a legend. </p><p>Lillian’s mad dash stalled for a moment while she looked at me shocked, but it was nothing compared to her reaction to my next action. “Take this, you little snake,” I shouted as I created a wall of flame between the creature and Lillian. It was an impressive looking spell, but lacked the power to hurt dragon serpent. Effectively, it was a little better than a mirage. </p><p>But it still fulfilled its purpose. The creature, which was about to catch up with Lillian, was forced to stop to avoid the sudden conflagration, its attention on me. I was hoping that the unfamiliar presence of the flames would make it hesitate for a while. But to my surprise not only it started moving once more the moment, but also it passed through the wall of fire without the slightest hesitation, and continued to chase Lillian. </p><p>Its display of intelligence and discernment ability came as a nasty surprise, but I didn’t have time to consider its implications. Instead, I sent a chain of elemental attacks towards it even as moved forward, wanting to cut its path before it could catch up with Lillian. The chain of spells I used was exhausting, but on the positive side, it was impossible to dodge. But the creature had another nasty surprise for me. It actually chose the weakest spells among my attack chain and tanked them while dodging the others. It was a discernment ability far above an animal could display. </p><p>“Fuck me, it’s a familiar,” I murmured in shock. I had never heard a dragon serpent familiar, but I had the opportunity to watch a creature of similar strength in action. One of the old guardian priests back in school had a lightning falcon as a familiar, and the additional intelligence had turned it from a dangerous critter into a ruthless killer. The combination of its natural power and enhanced intelligence had been impossible to overwhelm. </p><p>Unfortunately, I was already facing creature, and running away was not an option. And even if I did, it wouldn’t have helped, because if my suspicions were correct, its presence on the island was no coincidence. “Just how much secret resources a pirate could have,” I sighed in exasperation even as I slammed my free hand on the floor, injecting my power into the ground. A moment later, several pillars of hardened earth appeared around the creature, immobilizing it momentarily. It broke through in a second, its eyes still on Lillian, obviously under orders, but that was enough for me to conjure a crackling ball of lightning and slam it to the creature, making it cry in fury. </p><p>That managed to achieve my objective, and the creature’s eyes finally focused on me, burning with hatred. “How fun,” I said even as I pulled back, sending several bolts of fire against it, hoping to put a little distance between us, but the creature chose to tank them instead. It was one smart fucking bugger, even worse than the lightning falcon. It swiped, and I managed to dodge, though it left a rather painful slash, my blood starting to spill. </p><p>“You want my blood,” I exclaimed even as I squeezed the box in my palm. “It’ll not be cheap, you bastard!” With that, I put everything I had to pull a blade of stone from the ground, its edges burning with an unsettling green fire, and even the creature took a step back when it felt. I dashed forward and slashed, leaving a deep cut on one of its limbs. The creature cried in anger and threw itself at me with a reckless abandon. </p><p>The battle started anew, this time much more equal, each slash leaving a pained cut on the creature’s body. But it wasn’t without its price, because I took several wounds during my reckless assault, and my endurance was nothing compared to a magical creature. Even worse, my vision started to blur, far worse than the wounds would cause. The cursed flame I conjured was devouring my reserves at an unbelievable rate. Under normal circumstances, five seconds was my limits, but it already had been fifteen seconds. I only maintained it thanks to the mysterious box I was holding, but even that was nothing more than a temporary solution. I had seconds at best. </p><p>I lost all hope when the creature actually realized the drawback of my strategy and started to fight defensively, removing my hope of landing a lucky blow. I had no option left but try for a miracle. </p><p>“Let’s see what we have here,” I murmured as I took a step back, and opened my palm, looking at the box. With all the protective locks, unlocking it would have taken hours, but luckily, I was holding a shortcut right now. I brought my blade across the surface, shattering the ruins in a blow, and suddenly, an incredible amount of power filled the opening, increasing further when I flipped the box open. </p><p>I was frozen with shock, only by a miracle maintaining my grip on the box with my stiffened fingers. My momentary lack of concentration was enough for the blade to disperse, leaving me defenseless. Luckily, the creature was too shocked to take advantage of my lapse. </p><p>I was holding a dragon heart in my hand! A real, actual dragon heart! </p><p>It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that a dragon heart was the most valuable treasure in the world. It could be only acquired from the carcass of a real dragon, which usually meant one weakened by old age, or an infantile one too weak to defend itself properly -relatively, of course, as it still required an army to defeat. Even if it was the weakest grade, it was still peerless. Assuming I could successfully bring this to Rome and gift it to one of the Consuls, I would get adopted into his house as a reward, making me a noble citizen of the Republic, giving me unbelievable power. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that I would be untouchable in Britanium, which, despite its wealth, was nothing more than a backwater province. Any noble would be willing to exchange their titles to become an ordinary citizen in Rome. And I couldn’t even start imagining the riches I would receive if I managed to bring it to Constantinople and gifted it to the Emperor of the East, but a small city of my own wouldn’t be out of consideration. After all, a dragon heart allowed unlimited possibilities. It could be used to forge new treasures, peerless weapons, even train legions of unbeatable power… </p><p>Of course, that was nothing more than a passing fancy. Now that I had broken through its protective casing, it spread very distinctive energy that could be detected miles away, and nothing more than a full legion would be able to defend it. I had no chance of keeping its possession. </p><p>Though that was nothing more than a thought exercise, because my survival would take a miracle. Dragon heart provided me with even more power without its protective casing, but unfortunately, I was already at my limit physically. Too exhausted to conjure the blade once more. And while a dragon heart could improve a mage’s maximum power and capacity several times, it was only through a carefully-tailored training that took years while the mage slowly absorbed a sliver of dragon heart’s energy. </p><p>Soon, the creature was dashing towards me once more, my death was just a second away. And since I was about to die otherwise, I decided to do something crazy, hoping that it would give me the boost I needed to kill the monster before I joined it in the halls of Neptune. </p><p>I swallowed the dragon heart!</p><p>The clear expression of shock on the creature’s otherwise alien face was too amusing. Even its limited perception was enough to understand the craziness of my action. It stopped and tried to pull back. Unfortunately, the fire that filled my every scrap of being was just looking for an excuse to escape, already covering my skin. I was unable to move, but the creature was too scared to take advantage of it. A second later, it simply became impossible for it to take advantage, as a barrier of flame covered my immediate surrounding, crackling threateningly. </p><p>I might die, but I would be damned if it was for nothing. With that, I managed to raise my arm, and pointed my trembling finger at the dragon serpent. A wave of gold and crimson flame spread forward, only a fraction of it hitting the creature, but it cut through its body like it was made of paper, evaporating half of its head in the process. It was dead before it could even hit the floor. </p><p>“Not a bad way to die,” I murmured despondently, feeling melancholic. After years of struggle, I managed to take my first step to freedom, only to fall before I could soar. </p><p>But before I could make peace with my death, the flames suddenly disappeared. I collapsed as exhaustion that I had never felt before, something even the worst training session with my grandfather wouldn’t compare. I lay helpless as the gentle breeze caressed my skin. It felt like hours had passed, even though objectively, I knew that not even a minute had passed since the battle started. It was just that intense. </p><p>Before I could focus on the details of the miracle that happened, Lillian appeared once more, a determined expression on her face, an improvised dagger from a jagged piece of stone in hand. She clearly came here to help, despite knowing it would mean certain death with her impaired magic. Brave girl, I thought in amusement. It was weird how only in a situation of life and death, people would reveal their true face. And on Lillian, I was impressed with that I had found. Her naked body, covered with a light sheen of sweat, just made the situation better. </p><p>It took a second for her to process the sight, with me collapsed on the floor, clearly alive and without a scratch -the dragon heart managed to cure my wound, making it officially the most expensive tool of recovery-, and dragon serpent collapsed on the floor, lifeless. “How,” she murmured in shock even as the improvised daggers slipped away from her fingers while she dashed toward me. </p><p>“You look sexy,” I said. I was aiming to smirk to complete the impression, but I barely managed to put </p><p>“I used a secret family technique,” I explained, telling her the most believable lie possible. I didn’t want the complications from consuming a dragon heart known, and since she wasn’t aware that the creature was a familiar, me killing it with a secret technique still believable, although barely. </p><p>Before I could say anything else, however, she threw herself on me, and started crying. “How dare you throwing yourself at it with such a suicidal manner!” she managed to shout between her tears. “I was so scared.” </p><p>I was surprised by her emotional outburst, though feeling her naked body again mine was rather enjoyable. It was a pity that I was too exhausted to take advantage of the situation. “I’m going to nap for a bit,” I managed to murmur. “Could you be a dear and cook us some food while I’m sleeping,” I said. </p><p>“Food?” she murmured, unable to understand what I was driving towards. “Where are the fish you caught. I’m going to find them.” </p><p>“It’s here,” I said, and when she looked at me questioningly, I gestured to the corpse of the dragon serpent. “I’m hoping that it’s tasty, because catching that bastard was a chore…” </p><p>Lillian froze for a moment, then started laughing. It was more hysterical than amused, but still, it was laughter. I closed my eyes, and let the sleep take me, her crystal laugh better than a lullaby. </p>",

    "content": "<p>The sensation of waking up had been much more comfortable than I expected considering that I was sleeping in a poorly-constructed shelter in the middle of the sea half-naked, and had spent a considerable amount of power just before going to sleep. Still, even with the annoying sound of the wind ringing in my ears, I managed to get a night of good sleep, revitalizing me completely. </p><p>It seemed that I owed my angry blanket my thanks, I decided with a smirk as I enjoyed the tight grip of the arms around my body, and even better, apparently, I managed to move during my sleep to wrap my arms around her in turn, creating a facsimile of a lover’s embrace. I cracked my eye open, only to come face to face with her angelic face, the sleep effectively removing all her negative emotions, leaving only her ethereal beauty. It would be a lie if I said that I wasn’t tempted to lean down to steal a kiss from her pouty lips, but it was easy to control the desire. Doing something like that would create a pointless crisis, something I needed to avoid in my already-complicated situation. </p><p>Still, it didn’t mean that I was going to leave her alone while she had all that karma to work off. I shifted my legs until her core was resting directly against my shaft, which, combined with the pressure of her naked chest, turning the situation just delicious enough to make it worth the wait. Then, I stood motionless, watching her from my barely cracked eyes, doing my best impression of still being asleep. </p><p>Her movements started before she woke up. First, her hips moved back, momentarily making me afraid that I was going to lose the opportunity. But before that opinion could solidify, they pushed forward, tight enough that I could feel the heat of her core despite my pants. And to make things even better, the motion started to repeat, each caress enhancing my erection further while also making her beautiful breasts rub against my chest, adding yet another layer of pleasure to the game. Soon, her lips parted and a soft moan escaped her mouth. </p><p>Weirdly enough, it was her own moan that managed to wake her up. </p><p>Her eyes slowly opened, filled with comfort and desire. Unfortunately, that appealing mixture of emotion didn’t last long, dispersing the moment she remembered whose arms were around her. Her mouth widened in shock, about to let out a cry, but she managed to stop herself before it was too late, and carefully examined my face instead, solidifying the impression that I was still asleep. After several seconds of careful examination, she was convinced about my state of sleep, and tried to pull herself out of my grasp.</p><p>That part wasn’t as successful as she hoped to be, especially since my grasp was tight enough to prevent an easy escape, especially since she was still afraid of me waking up, and seeing our intimate situation. It was not only amusing to watch her twist and turn helplessly, but also highly erotic. After all, the only piece of clothing she had on was her rather flimsy panties, and those were not in the best of conditions after spending hours in saltwater. </p><p>As she twisted and turned, I finally managed to catch a full view of her breasts, even more beautiful than I imagined with their perfect firmness, cute pink areolas, and equally cute nipples. To make things better, her nipples were stiff, and while the cold played a role in their situation, I was confident enough to believe that it wasn’t due to the cold only. After all, she was wrapped in my arms, and regardless of my earlier reputation and standoffish behavior, I was still the savior that saved her from a fate worse than death. </p><p>In parallel to my thoughts, she stilled after a minute of helpless twisting and turning, examining my face with a curious expression with hints of naughtiness on her face. Clearly, the apparent heaviness of my sleep had given her an excuse to be naughty. “Marcus,” she murmured a couple of times, and after my lack of response, her hands started to roam over my body, tracing my muscles, clearly impressed. I had to struggle not to push my chest out with pride. After all, only a minority of the magic users preferred a path that required physical fitness, and even among them, only a small minority had pushed their physical fitness to my level. It hadn’t been an easy process, but the results spoke for themselves.  So, her fascinated expression was only to be expected as she slowly caressed the muscles on my chest and my stomach. </p><p>However, I was rather surprised when her hands continued to travel down until they landed on the obvious bulge in my pants. I hadn’t expected her to actually molest me to such a degree while thinking I was asleep. Apparently, my little noble lady was much more adventurous than my assumptions. Curious just how far she would go, I actually loosened my arms after she caressed my shaft a few times, giving her the opportunity she needed to get away from my grip. </p><p>She took the chance, and after doing so, she pushed my shoulder slightly so I ended up laying on my back. However, her next step managed to surprise me even further. She poked me a couple of times while calling my name, but hadn't repeated the action louder when I failed to react, which would have been the reasonable action if she had been trying to wake me up. Instead, she crouched next to me, her arms hanging freely, her whole body on display, creating a divine view as the morning sun mixed with her blonde locks. </p><p>Watching her like that, my pants were getting uncomfortably tight, enough to make me consider cutting the ploy short. At that point, however, Lillian decided to solve the problem for me. Her delicate fingers traced my waist until she found the button, trembling in excitement. She sent another gaze to my face, this time much more careful, then popped it open, something she immediately followed by lowering my zipper. A brief struggle with my underpants later, my shaft stood proud and free. </p><p>I never felt such an urge to burst into laughter, unable to believe the prim and proper heiress Lillian, the girl that was idealized by all the other girls, and thought as the ideal wife by all the boys in the school, would go as far as to undress me in my sleep just for her curiosity. At that moment, I was sure that it would be the end, but she somehow had even more surprises for me. Her finger landed on my shaft, tracing across its length gently like she was trying to familiarize herself with its presence. A second finger was added to the mix, and soon after, her hand was wrapped around my girth, gently moving up and down. Her motions were stiff and amateurish, indicating that it was the first time that she had contact with a male member, but it only made the situation more delicious. </p><p>Unfortunately, her little play of naughtiness ended soon after. For a moment, she leaned further, her tongue out, making me think that she would take that unbelievable step, but she got cold feet before her tongue could touch the crown, and like she realized what she had been doing, her hand jumped away, something she followed with her whole body a moment later. She looked at me with the full realization of what she had been doing, shock dominating her expression, and she jumped away. She even ran out of the crude residence I had built, leaving me alone. </p><p>Only after sending a subtle mana wave to make sure she wasn’t around I stood up, unable to keep myself from chuckling. I sat for a few minutes, letting the magic flow freely in my body, testing the state of my reserves. And to my surprise, they were already full. </p><p>I couldn’t help but frown at the revelation. Having my reserves back to full was convenient, but the fact remained that it shouldn’t have happened that quickly, not after I had spent that much power wreaking havoc in the ship and breaking the runic bracelets, unless I was sitting in the center of a sanctuary. But there was no way that this island was a sanctuary, because if it was, the empire would have never missed the chance of building a temple here. And even if they did, various other powers, or even pirates, would have established a hideout. </p><p>I closed my eyes, focusing on my mana to understand the source. What I had found surprised me. The small box on my pocket was the source of it, a steady stream of mana had replenished what I had lost. With a sigh, I pulled the small box from my pocket, examining it curiously, unable to believe it was able to do something like that despite all the concealment and suppression runes around it. It was an even bigger treasure than I had first thought. </p><p>But that wasn’t exactly the best of news. The pirates were going to follow me with all of their power, the blow I delivered to them was too insulting for them to do otherwise, so I had thought that stealing the box wouldn’t have made a lot of difference. But now, I was doubting that the box was something the pirates could have acquired, meaning that likely they were keeping it for another power, probably a major family. </p><p>“Excellent,” I murmured. “Like my uncle wasn’t enough, I have managed to make another enemy in the shadows just a week after escaping the island,” I murmured mockingly. “Great going, Marcus.” </p><p>With a sigh, I stood up, not letting the latest realization to spoil my mood. After all, the pirates were based in Britanium, meaning their supporting power was likely based in the same location. And since I was already determined to avoid the island, there was not a lot they could do other than sending the occasional assassin or mercenary band, and that was a confrontation I was confident in betting. </p><p>And more importantly, these were considerations for when I reached the mainland and found a hideout. There was no need to spoil my mood preemptively, something I had learned by necessity. With the risks I always faced, I learned to enjoy the moment by necessity, otherwise, I would have died of depression long ago. </p><p>I walked to the shore, where Lillian was sitting on a stone, her legs pulled against her chest, making a great show of watching the waves. Even if I hadn’t watched her naughty curiosity, seeing her like that would have been enough to make me suspicious. “You’re finally up, I have been waiting for you to wake up for hours,” she murmured when I was close enough.</p><p>“Weird, I’m usually a light sleeper,” I said, making a cloud of worry to occupy her face momentarily. “Still, it doesn’t matter, we need to leave without losing too much time. I have no doubt that our sailor friends have caught both lifeboats by now, and are now returning to catch us. While this little cropping is not the best temporary outpost, they’ll still drop by sooner or later.” </p><p>“How are we going to leave this place. Even I know there’s no other island close enough to swim, and the mainland is too far away to reach with anything other than a ship, a simple boat would be suicide.” She sent a dismissive glare to the rocks around. “And even if that was doable, we still need a boat. And this place lacks anything we can use for that purpose.” </p><p>“Are you really sure that there’s nothing here to build a boat?” I said, cutting her off. </p><p>“Of course there isn’t, I’m not blind. There’s nothing here but rocks and sand,” she answered abrasively, which I easily recognized as a defense mechanism as she tried to compensate for her earlier curiosity. “And I know it because while you were busy sleeping lazily, I went through the place inch by inch. There are no trees, no debris, nothing.” </p><p>I smirked suggestively. “And since you’re so sure about that, you will be willing to bet on it, of course,” I said. </p><p>“Are you serious?” she said with a scoff, which was replaced with excitement when I nodded. “Excellent. Then, I want your pants.” </p><p>“Naughty,” I said with a chuckle, and her face blushed enough to be mistaken for the evening sun. “</p><p>“Insolence!” she shouted, still sitting on the ground with her legs pulled against her chest. “Shut up. I’m just making sure that you are going to go through the same inconvenience I had gone through. I have no interest in the disgusting thing you’re hiding in there!” she continued, shaking her arm threateningly. </p><p>I just chuckled. “Whatever you say, sweetie,” I said. “And from my part, I’m happy to have a day where you’re going to act as my maid.” Her face darkened at the bet, but before she could say anything, I continued. “Of course, we can have another bet if you’re afraid of losing.” </p><p>I was planning it to be the first step of many taunts before she accepted the bet with anger. Instead, she shouted pridefully. “Of course I’m not afraid. I accept!” </p><p>The session in the morning must have unbalanced her even more than my initial assumptions, I realized. It was a pity that staying in this little cropping could prove deadly, because I would have liked to see for how much I could push her in such a restricted space. It was such a pitiful loss of opportunity. Still, the gains were no less significant. “It’s a deal, then,” I said as I walked toward the shore, where I could dig for some sand. </p><p>“What are you doing?” she asked as she watched me dig big scoops of sand from the bottom of the sea with my telekinesis and piling it on the shore. “Are you looking for your breakfast? If so, you would have more luck with fishing.” And just as she mentioned breakfast, a cute gurgling reached my ear, and she blushed. </p><p>“Don’t worry, I’ll handle the breakfast in a few minutes. We need to secure our boat first.” And with that, I used my mana to shape a part of the sand into a long, thick sheet, approximately six feet to two feet, enough for two people to travel but a bit squeezed. </p><p>A dismissive snort reached my ear as I started drawing runes on the surface of the sand. I understood her reasoning. The most accepted way of preparing the runes was using a specially-prepared carving set enhanced for stability and conductivity, and then applying those runes to specially prepared plates to ensure maximum longevity. Anything other than these two techniques was temporary. Therefore, almost no one studied the techniques to use runes outside the accepted ways. </p><p>Of course, others didn’t have a crazy grandfather that abandoned them in the middle of a monster-filled forest with no shelter and no weapon time and time again, until they could perfect the art of rapid construction. The only reason I didn’t use these techniques last night to build a shelter was my reluctance to leave a clue for the pirates when they eventually found this outcropping. </p><p>Her scoffing was replaced with silence in quick order when a visible wave of heat started to spread from the pile of sand, forcing the sand to melt while containment runes forced it to maintain its shape. After a few moments, I had a sheet of molten glass to work as a foundation for my construction. I wanted to turn and mock her a bit for her poor judgment. Unfortunately, constructing a glass boat was too tricky to lose time with such matters. It didn’t take too much mana, but the control it required was immense, especially while trying to maintain the runes on a liquid surface through sheer willpower. </p><p>With that, I quickly constructed other blocks of sand, etching their runes quickly before letting them cook with internal magical fire, and soon, I had a glass boat that was radiating an unbearable heat. Without losing any time, I picked four flattish stones, and drew a rune each, using my fire-coated finger as the medium — a precious trick my grandfather taught me when I managed to make him proud by hunting a dozen dire wolves in retaliation when they dared to steal the prey I had trapped and killed, saying that he should reward sensible behavior. Crazy grandpa, I thought with equal amounts of fondness and hatred, placing the stones on the four corners of the boat, and pulled back, my task finally complete. </p><p>“And that’s how you construct a boat from the available materials,” I said as I turned towards my accidental guest and quest, expecting to find a frustrated expression on her face. </p><p>Therefore, I was surprised when I saw her standing, with open fascination on her face, watching the small boat I had built like she was hypnotized. The best evidence of her shock was her arms, which were gently hanging around her sides rather than covering her chest. I was surprised, but no way dissatisfied as I focused my attention on her breasts, watching them with an equal fascination. They were simply too perfect. </p><p>“I have never seen something like this,” she murmured in fascination. “Not only you drew dozens of runes without any tools or air, but you also maintained them without the internal magic of the materials…” she murmured. “I have never seen anything so fascinating, even the runemasters of my family would struggle to achieve such a thing, and they have been working on the art for decades. How could you do something like that, and still fail to graduate?” </p><p>I smirked as I gave her an exaggerated bow. “I aim to please milady. And let me say that I’m happy to see that you are happy with my craftsmanship despite losing the bet. I’ll be honest, I wasn’t expecting you to display magnanimity in defeat,” I said with excessive deference, reminding her of the defeat in a way that would make it hard for her to argue without throwing her pride away. “And the issue of graduation is not as simple as you think, and it’ll take a while to explain. I’ll do so after catching us some breakfast.” She nodded, her gaze still on the cooling glass boat. I took a few steps before turning back, this time laughter clear in my tone. “By the way, I wasn’t expecting you to warm up to me this quickly, though I’m very happy with the results.” </p><p>She looked at me questioningly, and I nodded towards her chest, where a very distinct absence of her arms had turned her into my eye candy. The angry cry I received, as a result, was simply delicious while she wrapped an arm around her chest, using the other to throw stones at me in anger. I chuckled as I used a mana shield to deflect the stones, leaving her with nothing but to let out another frustrated cry as she collapsed on the floor, her legs against her chest once more, her face burning with shame. </p><p>Messing with her was simply too much fun… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Lillian’s hand lingered over her shoulder when she realized I was yet to turn my back. A dissatisfied expression boomed on her face immediately. “I asked you to turn your back,” she repeated, her voice much sharper. </p><p>“You did,” I answered, still motionless, except my lips, which formed a wider, more infuriating smirk. </p><p>“So…” she said, her anger flaring once more. “Hurry up and turn your back.” </p><p>“I don’t feel like turning,” I answered, my eyes lingering over her body. “So, hurry up and undress. We have a long way to swim.” </p><p>“How dare you ask me to undress in front of you, you degenerate,” she said. A couple of strokes later, she was next to me once more, her arm flying, ready for another slap, once again interrupted before they could collide. </p><p>“Are you sure you want to treat your savior with this level of callousness,” I said while using her momentum to pull her even closer to myself, her body pressing against mine under the water. “My forgiveness is not unlimited, you know.” </p><p>Reminded of the precariousness of the situation, Lillian’s anger evaporated once more, but indignation remained. “You can’t ask me to undress in front of you,” she managed to say. </p><p>“What’s the difference? I’m going to see you while we swim. Is an extra minute such a big deal?” </p><p>Reminding her that I would receive a lengthy show of her nakedness only made the situation more awkward, so awkward that she managed to miss the fact that her body was pressing against mine while we were having that discussion. And while the sensation was delicious, I had an even more entertaining way of messing with her. I pulled back a bit, and one smooth movement, removed my shirt and threw it away, revealing the chiseled body that had been built through countless hours in training. </p><p>“What - what are you doing!” she exclaimed with a sudden blush, though her eyes locked on my muscles, which, I had to admit, shining rather impressively under the moonlight. </p><p>“I need to limit the drag to swim that long,” I explained, which was partially correct. It would help a bit, but I wanted to display my body to tease her. It was nice to finally show-off after all those years of playing the worthless weakling. “So, are you going to get rid of your dress, or should I start swimming and leave you behind?” </p><p>The blush on her face reached a monumental degree, but I could see that as her eyes danced over my chiseled chest, her reluctance had decreased a serious degree. “Are you really not going to turn your back?” she asked once more, but this time, she sounded resigned. And when I shook my head, a smirk still on my lips, she sighed and turned her back to limit the view I could get. Her delicate fingers slowly reached to her back, and she grabbed the zipper. </p><p>Since she was willing to be petty enough to deny me the full view, I decided to deliver a small prank, and cast a locking charm on the zipper. Normally, it would be impossible to cast a spell targeting her without her notice, but due to interference of the runic bracelets and her earlier adrenaline rush, her senses were far from their peak. The spell worked wonderfully, and her zipper proved to be impossible to move no matter how much she struggled. </p><p>And she struggled for quite a while before admitting defeat. The sheepish expression mixed with resentment she had on her face as she turned was simply legendary. “Can you help me with my zipper,” she whispered. </p><p>“I’m your servant, milady,” I answered exaggeratedly as I closed in. She turned her back once more and I grabbed the zipper, but from the angle, I was able to catch a glimpse of her cleavage when I used some magic to get a boost. With her dress soaked enough to stick to her skin, the sight was simply heavenly. Watching her curves for hours sounded tempting, but I needed to hurry up. Freezing waters of the sea were particularly unbearable during the nighttime. </p><p>But I made sure to cover my fingers with a minute amount of fire mana, enough that while I dragged my fingers down, I left a trail of comfortable warmth, a trick that should be particularly effective while she was suffering cold grip of the water. And just like I expected, she started to tremble the moment my fingers grazed her skin, something she covered up with excessive shivering to play it off as the effect of the cold weather. </p><p>I continued to pull down to zipper, letting her assume that I had been convinced by her transparent ploy. When I reached her bra, however, I let another string of magic to wrap around it, weakening it so that it would snap after one wrong move. Then, I continued to pull the zipper down, until my fingers caressed the small of her back, making her shiver once more. This time, she dashed forward, but didn’t even say anything. </p><p>I was tempted to scold her for her rudeness because she hadn’t thanked, but decided it would be too much. Instead, I observed as she slowly wiggled out of the dress, revealing her pale shoulders, shining deliciously under the moonlight. However, when she turned to me once more, I failed to catch a glimpse of her amazing cleavage, because she made sure to stay buried up to her neck, hiding her body from my eyes. </p><p>“Let’s go,” I said, and started swimming, slow enough that she could catch up even with my lead. It didn’t take long for her to catch up, and for a while, I stayed at a pace where she could follow me without straining herself. I discreetly observed her while we swam, appreciating the gentle lines of her back, but she managed to keep most of her body submerged in the water. And from the occasional smug smiles she sent to my side. </p><p>I let her have that victory, which was pretty inconsequential on the greater scheme of things. After all, we were still quite a distance away from the shore — I remembered from the maps I had examined that there’s a tiny island just three miles away, a place I could build a crude canoe to cover the rest of the distances. I had no intention of swimming thirty miles until we could reach the mainland. </p><p>About a mile into the journey, I started to pick up speed, and she sped up alongside, even though I could see clear signs of exhaustion on her movements. In her competitiveness, she didn’t want to admit defeat. And a minute into our new speed, she gasped in shock. “A moment-” she called me before stopping abruptly. </p><p>“What’s up?” I said as I stopped. </p><p>“I need to help me fix my clothes,” she explained without going into detail, her eyes drifting away. I looked at her with a suggestive smirk, and she quickly continued. “You wouldn’t hold back such a small help from your school friend, right?” she asked.</p><p>My smirk widened, unable to believe that she actually gave me such a huge hook to reel her in. “Sure, though I want a very simple thing from you. What’s my name?” </p><p>The shock on her face was delicious. “Scipio?” she managed to murmur after a long consideration. </p><p>“Not bad,” I said, but before she could relax, I continued. “But that’s my family name. Do you want to try once more for my name?” This time, her blush intensified even further as she hesitantly shook her head. “Good call, it’s better than trying to guess. My name is Marcus, by the way, so keep it in mind.” </p><p>“Marcus, I’ll remember it,” she said, shivering a bit now that we stopped, depriving her of the energy we got from the move. “I promise I’ll treat you much better, but can you help me fix my clothes before we freeze.” </p><p>“Sure, but since you failed on your previous task, I’m going to give you a chance to compensate. You just need to give me a kiss.”</p><p>The cry of outrage that left her pouty lips had been enough to give me an erection, and the amazing view as she quickly swam towards me while unable to properly hold her bra in place was just a bonus. When she arrived, another slap flew towards my face, but this time, I chose to pull back a bit. Lacking the resistance she had been expecting, she spun beautifully, then started to struggle to balance herself on the surface of the water. Her bra got dislodged even further in the process, enough to give me an eyeful of her bountiful breasts, even getting a hint of her rosy areola. I chuckled as until she finally managed to still herself once more. “You bastard!” she exclaimed. </p><p>I just smirked at her attempt to insult. “That’s your one chance, honey,” I explained. “You either give me a little kiss as a reward, or you deal with your bra yourself.” </p><p>With a huff, she turned and buried herself even deeper into the water, only her eyes out as she twisted and turned. She removed her bra, but I failed to get any good views. But watching her increasing frustration had been almost as fun. I knew she would fail, because I had put several points of weakness to her bra, and her attempts to fix it only made her more frustrated. “Okay, I admit defeat,” she murmured, finally coming to a decision that a fleeting kiss was not worse than constant exposure of her body. “Can you-” she tried to continue, but I cut her off. </p><p>“Nope.” </p><p>The sudden answer surprised her. “What do you mean, nope!” </p><p>“It’s clear. I gave you two chances to earn my help, and you pushed both of them away without even blinking. Now, you’re going to suffer the consequences.” She tried to complain, but I already started to swim once more, leaving her behind, sputtering. A few seconds later, she started following, but the distance started to get widen until she let out a frustrated cry and threw away her bra, getting rid of the dead weight that slowed her down. </p><p>When she caught up with me once more, her eyes were burning with impotent anger, but for me, it was sweeter than nectar. After years of suffering under her dismissive enmity, turning her into sputtering wreck impotent to exact revenge was a good change of pace. Even just that was enough to make me glad that I had saved her. Of course, the additional benefits, such as the occasional glimpse of her breasts whenever her arm moved wider than she intended, was welcome as well. </p><p>Nothing noteworthy happened during the next hour, until we finally saw the island on the distance, though, calling it a rocky outcropping would be more accurate. It was an empty, desolate place, barely a hundred feet across at its longest direction. There was no tree, no clean water, no easily-usable resource. I stepped into the ground, but Lillian chose to stay in the water, despite the fact that at this point, she was shivering visibly. “You know you would start freezing if you don’t come up to the floor,” I said, earning a dismissive harumph in exchange. “Your call,” I said with a shrug before walking deeper into the island, my mind already on the best way to create a shelter that I could rest for a couple of minutes. </p><p>I started using my magic as a makeshift shovel to quickly dig a hole in the middle of the small island, pulling large stones with telekinesis and putting them around the hole as additional windbreakers. Whenever I moved, I could feel the discomfort from the small box in my pocket, but I didn’t dare to pull it out. Whatever it was, it was clearly valuable, and I had no intention of unlocking it on Lillian’s presence.  </p><p>While I was focused on that, I finally heard footsteps closing in. I waited until they were just a few feet away, and only then I turned, meeting with one of the most glorious views I had the pleasure of seeing in all my life. Lillian stood straight with her body on display, her wet skin shining under the moonlight. Her golden locks were stuck together messily, and any makeup she possessed had long been washed away by the swim, but neither fact managed to steal a bit from her beauty. Her blue eyes burned with a delicious kind of anger, one that tempted me to drop everything and focus on earning the favor of the goddess that stood in front of me. </p><p>Of course, I had no intention of doing so, not when I had a better plan to get access to that sinful body. Her delicate neck and shoulders were adorned with water drops, while her arms were wrapped around her chest, but even with both arms, she failed to adequately cover her impressive breasts, their pale flesh peeking from the edge. Her stomach was flat with a hint of muscle despite her curves, showing the hints of dedicated training. </p><p>Then, my eyes moved lower, only to meet with the edge of her panties, which had long turned transparent after hours she spent in water. She had angled her body so that nothing important was on my sight, but still, I had the view of her long toned legs to compensate, lacking any flaw. Just having them wrapped around me once would be fair compensation for all the torture I had gone through the school. </p><p>But that was a topic for another day. </p><p>“Will you remove the bracelets,” she said in a confrontational manner, clearly expecting for me to push for another onerous condition after what I had asked to fix her bra. </p><p>“You know that you won’t be able to use any magic for a day at least, right?” I warned her. </p><p>“I know how a runic bracelet works,” she answered bitingly. </p><p>I shrugged. “Give me your hand, then,” I said even as I raised mine. </p><p>“Just like that?” she asked, shocked and suspicious. </p><p>I smirked in response. “Well, if you are not happily accepting my generosity, I’m more than happy to ask for a trade…” </p><p>Once again, panic exploded on her face. “No need! I’m very happy!” she exclaimed, and presented one of her hands to me, the other still wrapped around her chest. </p><p>It was unfortunate that the runic bracelets had to be removed one by one, as I would have liked to have an excuse to get both of her hands together. Still, removal of one arm increased the view I was exposed to rather radically, so I was happy with the results. “Brace yourself,” I said even as I flared my magic, wrapping around the runic bracelet. Removal of a runic bracelet was never trivial, even the weakest one, and the one on Lillian’s wrist was the strongest I had ever seen, much stronger than the ones that had been used as a punishment back in the Halls of Saturn. </p><p>It took ten minutes to remove the first one, and twenty minutes to remove the second one. When finished, both bracelets crumbled into dust, and a stiff wind carried the dust away. But as a result, I was trembling with exhaustion. Their removal took a decent amount of power, and even more concentration, and combined with the earlier exhaustion, I needed to sleep. So, I accepted her mumbled pleasantries with a node before speaking. “I need to rest,” I murmured as I stumbled towards the pit I had prepared. </p><p>Just as I was stepping inside, she spoke once more. “Where I’m going to rest?” </p><p>“The pit is big enough for both of us,” I mumbled as I sat down, enjoying the opportunity to rest. </p><p>“I can’t stay in there with you in my current state of dressing!” she exclaimed, this time, a flare of instinctual magic accompanying her outburst. That wild display of magic was the reason for the recommendation of not using magic immediately after the removal, as it weakened the control of a magic-user significantly. Trying to cast a spell under those conditions had the risk of damaging the caster permanently.  </p><p>“Not my problem, honey. I’m too exhausted to create another pit. Either come here, or stay out and freeze. Either way, it’s not my problem.” </p><p>Once again, her anger was nourishment to my soul. “You-” she tried to shout, but noticing my satisfied smirk, she cut it short. “Close your eyes, or I’ll kill you.” </p><p>This time, I decided to follow her request, because I was beset with a desire to sleep, and she had the potential to be quite the annoyance. I lay on the ground, amused by the steps closing in. Soon, I felt a presence next to me, a presence that shivered ceaselessly. I acted like I was asleep, curious about what she would do, but I was already planning to cast a ward that would help by warming the area. I was waiting to rest a bit first. </p><p>“Turn your back,” she suddenly ordered, and curious about what she was about to do, I followed, turning my back towards her, though I was ready to blast her in case she actually tried to stab me from behind. But I was really surprised when instead of an attack, I felt a pair of arms wrapping around my torso. Even more interesting was the presence of her breasts, distinctly pressing against my back. “Don’t get any ideas, I’m just doing it to keep up warm,” she explained, but her outrage didn’t prevent her voice from hitching. </p><p>“Whatever you say, honey,” I said, and received a painful pinch in return, which only made me chuckle. She needed much more to spoil my mood while I could feel the spectacular nakedness of her breasts against my back. Still, I said nothing, prioritizing rest over messing with her. Tomorrow was going to be a difficult day. </p><p>However, with her almost naked body pressing against mine, her breaths tickling my ears, unconsciousness had been rather difficult to attain. Still, in the end, darkness took over… </p>",

    "content": "<p>And just like that, a week had passed on board the pitch-black vessel which claimed to be a lawful privateer, though their tendency to send fireballs and lightning bolts to fishing boats for fun stretched the meaning of the word. And despite I was able to console myself its temporary status, I still found the experience horrible. </p><p>It wasn’t the food -though it was barely tastier or nutritious than moldy wood- or my sleeping space -a ruined blanket in the corner of a room that was filled with twenty other men. While my living conditions were horrible, it wasn’t the first time I had to suffer physical discomfort. I had gone through worse back in my family estate. The training trips with my grandfather had been even worse, where I had to stay hungry or sleep under the rain because I failed to successfully hunt in a forest where even experienced Rangers feared to step in. When I was eleven. </p><p>No, it was the dismissive treatment and the lack of respect I had received. </p><p>“Clean this as well, rookie,” shouted one of the other sailors as he passed me, toppling the water-filled bucket with a kick, drenching the area that I just finished the cleaning. I bit back the spell that would have skewered him with a flaming spear, and with a sigh, resumed my task. </p><p>I found the lack of focused intent in their casual cruelty maddening. My school days, a bastard in an institution filled with so-called noble peers, wasn’t a walk in the park, but they were a bunch of entitled brats that thought that having only three servants was a punishment, and it impacted the effectiveness of their insults. And even then, I was the only bastard in the school, which, perversely, made the situation special in some way. They were trying to break me to the best of their ability, and when I hadn’t, it meant I was the victorious party. I hadn’t noticed that then, but it had been more dismissive, there was no way I would have survived the Halls with my sense of self intact. </p><p>“Just a few more days,” I murmured. From what I could read from the night sky, I could see that the ship was closing towards the Germanic Wildlands -a chaotic area split between free tribes and monsters- and even if they chose not to dock, I could slip in the water and swim the moment I could see the land. Just a few more days, and I would be truly free. </p><p>“I see a boat nearby,” the lookout shouted in alarm, and just like that, everyone was alert on the deck. And for good reason. Even in the darkness of midnight, it was hard to miss a boat in such calm weather. Meaning either the lookout was sleeping, or the other ship used magic. </p><p>I stiffened, ready to cast a spell. Magic wasn’t exactly rare, but hiding a whole boat from the sight for an extended time, especially without utterly exhausting the caster, was a difficult task. From what I had observed until now, the ship had two mages on the ship that had enough power to resist against someone that could do something like that. The gray-haired first mate whom I was yet to learn his name because everyone called him Legate, and Gorro. Whomever our surprise guest was, there was no doubting his strength. I didn’t know how I would fare something as strong, but unfortunate revealing of my true power would be a given. </p><p>“It’s the captain,” the lookout called once again, but it was strange that his panic hadn’t abated in the slightest, nor did the crews’. They lowered their weapons, and started bustling around, trying to make themselves busy. The Captain must be a scary fellow if he managed to scare them up that easily. I moved towards a more concealed part of the deck and grabbed a mop. I was good at concealing my magical power, but there was no point in risking it against another expert. </p><p>Soon, a small boat with a black triangle sail drifted in view, drifting over the water. When it reached the edge of the ship, it started levitating. The crew moved away in sync, suggesting that it wasn’t the first time that was happening. Casually levitating a boat was not a simple matter, another evidence of captain’s strength, especially after maintaining a field of obstruction for such a long time. He was an upper-tier mage in a minimum. A sorcerer of lower circle, even, considering the rather excessive fear the crew was displaying. </p><p>I cowered around the corner more, trying to copy the fear the weaker members of the crew were displaying. Getting noticed by someone that strong was not good news, especially in the middle of his ship, where he had the support of over a hundred strong crew. </p><p>While playing the scared deckhand, I started examining the boat, which finally landed on the deck. It was a beautiful one, sleek, made from a dark wood I didn’t recognize, filled with carefully-drawn runes, some to enhance its speed on the water while the others enhanced its durability. It even had a few runes to enhance its floating capabilities, but not enough to remove the impressiveness of the magical achievement. </p><p>Then a man, dressed in grays and blacks, stepped onto the deck. He was a tall man, with a noble bearing, his cloak hiding his face. A mysterious figure, and presumed by the fearful gazes of the crew, the Captain. Some would focus on his determined steps. Others would focus their attention examining the rune-covered blade on his waist, a masterwork of magic and skill, or the spry crossbow on his back. Some might even focus on the expensiveness of his clothes. My attention was on the rope he was holding… </p><p>But it was nothing compared to the surprise I would have next. He tugged the rope, forcing a girl to step onto the deck as well. I gasped in shock, but luckily it went unnoticed among the other surprised reactions. </p><p>It wasn’t the great beauty of the prisoner that surprised me, though she was indeed beautiful, with a lithe body with curves at interesting places, her blonde hair as bright as gold. Nor her clothes, rich and elaborate despite their rough state, indicating a recent combat encounter. It wasn’t the pair of runic bracelets around her wrists cutting her magic flow, leaving her effectively helpless. No, it was her face that surprised me, because I recognized her from school. Lillian, heiress of the house of Malone, one of the top three students of the graduates the Halls had processed this year. </p><p>“It’s just my luck,” I murmured even as I watched the captain dragged her along with himself, cutting through the crew without a concern… That, more than anything, indicated the strength of the hold the captain had maintained over the crew. Without absolute control, he wouldn’t dare to display such a beauty to a bunch of wild pirates. As he walked, the first mate and Gorro quickly met with him. They had a quick talk, and the captain passed Lillian’s rope to his first mate before turning towards the rest of the crew. “This girl is going to be a virgin sacrifice,” he explained in a calm tone, barely more than a casual speaking volume. Still, with the absolute silence that covered the dock, it was heard by everyone. “And if someone dares to jeopardize that…” he added, then walked back to his small boat, not even bothering to complete his threat. And from the faces the crew was making, it was clear that he hadn’t needed to. </p><p>As the captain’s boat floated toward the surface of the water, I was cursing my luck. Finding one of my classmates imprisoned for on the same pirate ship I had been conscripted to while trying to escape could only happen to me. And to make things worse, she was going to be sacrificed in a ritual. Those kind of rituals were not unheard of, but they were restricted to captives and heinous criminals, even daring to sacrifice a slave had huge repercussions. I wouldn’t even want to imagine the punishment for daring to kidnap and sacrifice a noble heiress; yet the captain -who clearly was not a fool- dared to communicate that for a full ship of people. </p><p>There was something horrible afoot. </p><p>The best option was for me to steal a lifeboat during the night, and get away from those crazy pirates as much as possible. But even as I contemplated that, I knew that it wouldn’t be the option it would take. I was a selfish prick, but not enough to actually abandon a classmate to such a horrible fate, no matter how much I disliked her smug attitude. Lillian had been one of the worst people I had to deal with during the school, constantly mocking and insulting in the hopes of trying to make me drop off. Still, these schoolyard scuffles were not enough reason to leave her to such a fate. </p><p>I needed to save her and leave the ship. And I needed to do that before that scary captain returned; no need to start a fight with a man with an unknown level of power. </p><p>For the rest of the day, I had done my best to prepare the components of my escape; which had been rather easy because these pirates weren’t expecting to be infiltrated by a mage of my skill level. First, I had etched a few explosive runes to the sails, then embedded several animation charms on two lifeboats, with enough power to push them several miles. And some sleeping powder to the evening chow completed the deal. When the midnight hit, the ship was covered with unnatural silence. </p><p>Not one to take unnecessary risks, I pulled a cloak of shadows around myself -a darkness based spell to increase one’s ability to stay hidden. Then, I sneaked towards the captain’s cabin, which was working as an impromptu prison, and walked towards the two guards. Their discipline was impressive. Even in the middle of the ship, they were alert, their eyes scaling the deck carefully. </p><p>Unfortunately for them, wrapped in darkness, the cloak of shadows was too hard to notice. The first one only noticed when the knife already passed through his throat, spraying blood. The second guard opened his mouth, but I had an air blade already conjured, so before a whimper could escape his mouth, he fell on the floor, gasping for a breath that would never come. Even as he connected to the floor, I turned my attention to the door, letting my magic flow to break through the enhancements. </p><p>It took me two minutes to unlock the door. Two precious minutes that left my heart thumping in excitement. When I finally opened the door, Lillian was on the bed, a dark expression on her face. “Is it finally the time,” she spat angrily, darkness preventing her from noticing the bodies of the two guards, mistaking me for a guard instead. Still, it was better than her realizing my true identity. I could have gestured her to stay silent, but I doubted that she would follow it. Instead, I dashed and pressed my hands against her mouth. </p><p>Her eyes widened in shock, and I felt her teeth locking around my flesh. Bitch, I thought as a small yelp escaped my mouth. She looked at me smugly. “Continue that, and I might change my mind about saving you,” I warned her, and just like that, her whole expression changed. </p><p>“S-save me,” she gasped in shock when I pulled my hand away, and repeated it in a whisper when I gestured her to be silent. “Really?!” </p><p>I didn’t bother to answer her, just gestured to the bodies of the guards, and two pools of blood around them. She looked at me with stars in her eyes, her expression enchanting. Despite the danger of the situation, I found myself looking at her face, captured by her beauty. Back in the school, whenever she looked at me, she had a disgusted expression on her face, which reduced the impact of her beauty significantly, but now, she was no different than a legendary fairy. Even her lack of makeup, or ruined clothes failed to reduce her beauty. I had to bite my lips to distract myself before starting to speak. “Yes, I’m here to save you, but you need to follow my orders immediately, and without a protest,” I explained even as I destroyed the rope around her arms, but left the runic bracelets alone. </p><p>“Won’t you remove these as well,” she asked, her expression enthusiastic, and a bit bloodthirsty, imagining how to take revenge on the pirates that dared to take her hostage. </p><p>“No, these stays for now, it would create a mana burst and alert everyone without the keys,” I explained. “We need to wait until they are at least ten miles away. We can’t afford the risk.” </p><p>Once again, she nodded obediently, no trace of her bitchy behavior could be seen. She stood up, but her legs suddenly trembled, exhaustion catching up with her. I managed to wrap my arms around her waist before she could fall on the floor, though the way she leaned against me with a sigh, giving me a brief tutorial of her curves, was an interesting surprise. It was time to leave, but before doing that, I wanted to leave one last surprise for the crew. By saving Lillian, I had already created a feud, so more damage I dealt, the better. </p><p>With that in mind, I crouched down, about to slide a magical explosive under the bed, but when I looked, I noticed a small box there, barely bigger than my palm, covered by a weak aura of power. But the interesting part was the endless layers of concealment runes that covered the box. I didn’t know what was inside, but if it was spreading that much power despite the suppression, it had the potential to be priceless. </p><p>Naturally, I stole it.  </p><p>After standing up, I wrapped my arm around Lillian’s waist once more before leading her out. I expanded the cloak of shadows to her. It was a rather exhausting magical trick, but it was worth it, because the cloak not only made us hard to notice by the naked eye, but also it further hid our magical presence, allowing us to avoid arcane detection methods. “Aren’t we going to take a lifeboat?” she asked, when she noticed our direction had no lifeboat. </p><p>“No, they are the bait,” I answered. “Now, wrap tight,” I said, offering a piggyback ride. She looked apprehensive, but a warning glare was enough to make her listen. I threw a rope from the side and climbed down, relaxing only when I felt the freezing cold of the night water wrapped around. I knew it wouldn’t long before we had been noticed, so I cast a wide-range spell, one that was noticed by everyone on the ship. It would have been a horrible choice if it wasn’t for one important detail. With such an excessive spell, they had no way to determine the epicenter. </p><p>And since it triggered all the traps I had prepared simultaneously, they hadn’t had any time to search for the source either. Two lifeboats collided against the surface with a huge splash before starting to travel with maximum speed, away from the main ship. Then, several explosion went through the ship, flickering flames brightening the sky. Meanwhile, we stayed in the water, motionless, listening as the ship exploded into chaos, a range of panicked orders making the situation even worse. </p><p>“The prisoner has escaped! Follow the boats,” called a voice, and suddenly, a magical field covered the ship and it picked up speed despite its lack of sails. A useful spell, though I wouldn’t want to be on the place of the mages that were responsible for that particular feat. It was unbelievably exhausting, especially at the scale they were trying to apply. </p><p>Lillian’s arms around me tightened as she struggled to resist the cold, but her ruined clothes and her exhaustion working against her. And with the ship still near, I wasn’t willing to risk casting a warming charm, comfort wasn’t as important as the survival. And as an added benefit, our wet clothes were worked even worse to limit the feeling, so I could gain an even better understanding of her curves. We watched the flame-covered ship disappeared into the horizon, following the enchanted lifeboats. </p><p>Only after the ship disappeared on the horizon, I let the cloak of shadow to fade away, because we were too far away from the detection range. As the cloak faded, Lillian turned to look at me, a worshipful expression on her face. But that expression only lasted until her eyes found my face. “Bastard!” she exclaimed in a great shock as she pushed me away, her face blurred with astonishment. “You pathetic failure. What the hell are you doing here!” </p><p>I knew that she had gone through a horrible ordeal, and the shock of meeting with me in the middle of the sea in the middle of a pirate vessel couldn’t have help. But while I understood her concerns, that hadn’t meant that I was willing to act as a welcome mat as I did in the school. Here, I didn’t have to act anymore. So, I made sure to maintain eye contact when I spoke my next words. “Well, if you’re not satisfied with your savior, you’re free to make your way towards the shore on your own,” I said before turning my back and starting to swim. </p><p>I managed to move several lengths before she managed to sputter in shock. “Just wait a minute! You can’t leave me here!” she exclaimed pompously, though I was happy to note there was a tone of desperation hidden underneath. It showed that, despite all of her entitlement, she knew the precariousness of her situation. </p><p>“I can’t?” I said after I turned towards her once more, an indifferent expression on my face. “Why exactly?” </p><p>The expression of shock on her face was positively delicious. “Because I’m the heiress, my family will reward you,” she managed to say after a moment of consideration, preemptively believing her victory. “Whether it’s money or hidden spells, I’ll make sure that you’ll get what you need.” </p><p>“Not interested,” I said without even thinking. It wasn’t that the rewards weren’t tempting, but I needed to go back to Britanium to receive those rewards, which would put me back where I started. And I wouldn’t trust her family to protect me against my uncle. They might feel indebted to me for saving their heiress, but not enough to make an enemy out of another major family. House Scipio was not an existence easily disregarded. “What else you got?” </p><p>“We’re classmates, and it’s the decent thing to do,” she managed to add, shocked that her previous offer got rejected. </p><p>“We were classmates,” I corrected her. “And even then, do you remember any encounter that would make me feel indebted enough to help you.” The sudden desperation on her face was enough to tell me that she failed to come up with one. Funnily enough, I did have a couple of nice memories of her during the first year, before I established a reputation for uselessness, putting her above the batch despite her general bitchiness. “But it would be a dick move to leave you here,” I said, my tone softer, and I swam towards her. “How well can you swim?” I asked. </p><p>Just like that, fear’s hold weakened on her. “I can move hundreds of miles before exhausting-” she started before I cut her off. </p><p>“Without magic,” I countered.</p><p>“Without magic! Why?” she said, shocked. </p><p>“Because, as you should remember, I don’t want to alert the pirates by removing the runic bracelets. The rush of magic you’ll create when they loosen is enough to bring them back on. Hence you need to move without magic. Even I won’t be able to use magic for the first few miles, because we don’t know how strong their detection capabilities are. Their captain is definitely not an ordinary man.” </p><p>“No, he’s not,” she answered. “He killed twenty elite house guards singlehandedly before kidnapping me.” </p><p>Definitely a sorcerer, I thought with a shudder even as I nodded despondently. Just my luck. While it wasn’t nice to learn that the man that I had just screwed over massively was quite a bit stronger than me, it was still better than wandering over blindly. At least, now I knew I should stay away from him to the best of my ability. “Okay, then, remove your dress and we can start swimming.” </p><p>“How dare you,” she exclaimed even as a slap exploded on my cheek. I could have dodged it, but I let it connect, but it barely moved my head. </p><p>When she tried to slap me a second time, however, I was quick to grab her wrist. “Enough! Are you going to throw a tantrum like a child,” I said. “You need to remove your dress, or the drag will exhaust you, and you’ll drown. And on the ship, I had used too much of my magic to waste on anything frivolous. So, you either follow my directions, or you get exhausted in the middle of the sea. Your choice,” I said with a sharp finality. </p><p>Truth be told, the explanation I gave to her was kind of bullshit. I still had quite a bit of mana left, what I had done on the ship hadn’t even taken a quarter of my total strength. But after that slap, I was feeling vindictive, and it was a good way to mess with her.  </p><p>“Turn your back,” she ordered while grabbing the shoulder of her dress. </p><p>I just smirked. I had no intention of turning back when faced with such an opportunity… </p>",

    "content": "<p>I usually enjoyed the smell of the sea, but today, at the docks of the Londinium, the biggest city of the colonial island of Britanium, my enjoyment was ruined by the disgusting miasma of the many thousands people and livestock, entering and exiting hundreds of the ships that filled the harbor. It was such a crowd that even the various spells and enhancements that were supposed to keep air clear had failed; though I doubt they were cast according to requirements, for the Governor, money saved by using a substandard core was much more important than the comfort of the lower classes, after all. </p><p>I couldn’t say that I blamed him. After all, this port was dedicated to goods of limited value such as food, livestock, and low-quality magical crystals. It was filled with plebs, slaves, rejects, and occasional freedmen; none of them justified the expense of establishing a wide-scale cleansing field. </p><p>It was a pity that I had to suffer through it despite not belonging to any of those groups. Though not a lot of people would agree that my status was a significant improvement compared to other dregs of society. After all, I was a bastard. The fact that I was a Noble bastard did little to soften the blow, especially since my situation had another fact that made it even worse. My noble blood didn’t come from my father’s side, applying the long-respected tradition of stress relief with a common lady. No, in my case, it was my mother who strayed. In the Empire, the family was everything, and I was a double-disgrace because I was an eternal reminder of my mother’s misstep. Scorn from others was the best I received, things usually devolved into physical assault quickly, both in the family estate and outside. </p><p>I didn’t know about the reason for my mother’s decision, as she had died in childbirth, as no one ever bothered to talk me about that. Maybe it was a night of alcohol-fueled folly, or maybe it was forbidden love. I tried, of course, but I only had my grandfather, who was the patriarch of the family, to ask about it. I did, but my grandfather never explained, and after the third extra-painful ‘training’ session that left me unable to move for a week, I have stopped asking. </p><p>Grandfather, I thought with mixed feelings. Even now, two years after his death, I still don’t know how to feel about that man. On the other hand, he had the power to stop people from messing with me, but he never did, giving his implicit approval so even the servants hadn’t had any fear to take shots whenever they found the opportunity. On the other hand, he personally trained me, training that he kept hidden from anyone else, a training that left me bordering the lands of Pluto more than once, but despite all these close calls, it made me strong… </p><p>Then, three years ago, he had taken an unbelievable decision. He personally sponsored my admission to the Halls of Jupiter, the most important center of magical education, limited only to a select number of noble scions had shown a great promise. </p><p>A bunch of high nobles, and me, a double-disgraced bastard. Predictably, it was painful three years, where I had to hide, steal, cheat, and overall, act like a complete waste of space that was unable to gather more than a couple of sparks, just to survive. It was a lesson I learned back in my family estate. I either played the pathetic clown, so everyone limited themselves to painful and humiliating assaults whenever they were bored, otherwise writing me off as worthless, or I could show my true potential to be a danger, the case which everyone would do their best to kill me before my abilities could come to full fruition. </p><p>I had chosen the first, which, incidentally, was the only reason I was able to survive. Because a year into my schooling, my grandfather had died, and with him, I had lost the last scrap of protection I had back in my family. With my uncle as the Patriarch, my death in the family estate was a certainty. He had made his wishes to remove the ‘disgrace’ clear more than once back in the family estate. The only reason he didn’t arrange for an assassination when I was in school because it would have been unbelievably costly, it wasn’t worth to get rid of a bastard, no matter how disgraceful his presence was. </p><p>But if he knew my true abilities, he wouldn’t have blinked before commissioning my death. Instead, he waited for me to graduate and lose the protection of the Halls.</p><p>That was where I decided to throw another curveball to his plans. In the Halls of Saturn, surviving was not easy, but it was almost trivial for the survivors to finally graduate. That was why everyone was shocked to learn that I had failed the graduation trial despite the three chances I had been given. The teachers were suspicious, of course, a couple of them -probably my uncle’s friends- had tried to make me pass regardless, but the rules were clear, and they were helpless. </p><p>Of course, by doing so, I had forfeited all the benefits the school had made possible, from the ability to serve as an officer in the armed forces, to the privilege of standing for election for a seat in the Senate. All because of one critical detail. </p><p>People that failed the graduation were allowed to leave the school three days before the other students. And that three days were all I needed to screw up my uncle’s plans, and cut through the guards that he posted around the school, unprepared because they thought that they still had three days to establish a cordon, scrambling desperately. The breach hadn’t been easy even then, I had killed seven men -all loyal retainers of my uncle- and taken three dangerous wounds -thankfully, none magic resistant, so I was able to take the next step of my crazy gambit, passing through a wild forest to hide my tracks. I wasn’t fancying my chances to pass through a monster-filled forest with an open wound. Even in top condition, it was a small miracle that I survived the trek. I was curious just how many retainers my uncle lost trying to follow me, and I was willing to bet it was close to three digits.  </p><p>My strategy meant that I had burned all the bridges. On the island of Britanium, I had no chance of survival. Hence the reason I was at the docks, disguised as a sailor, trying to find a ship to get away before the I was found by my uncle's trackers, or the assassins he had doubtlessly hired after losing a significant portion of his armed forces. </p><p>With that in mind, I walked close to the water, carefully examining each ship and their sailors, trying to pick the best ship for my travel. The most important thing was that their time of departure, the sooner, the better. Of course, it was a given that it should have a destination outside of Britanium, and preferably not to land like Gaul, where my uncle had strong business ties. So, while he couldn’t use his title of Warlock to interject, he could still use his business interests as a favor, leading a local Warlock, or even a Governor if I’m particularly unlucky, against me instead. And the third requirement was the state of the ship. I needed the ship to be desperate, desperate enough to get a new sailor without looking to his background too much… </p><p>But despite my carefulness, my search came to a premature end soon after. I was passing near a humongous ship, pulled in the middle of the docks, the slots next to it noticeably empty despite the overall crowd. Not surprising, as the ship was the most garish eyesore I had the displeasure of seeing, and I had spent the last three years in a magic school for nobles, almost every male imitating peacocks in a colorful attempt to prove their taste and wealth. </p><p>The ship was no less ugly than the robes and the cloak my schoolmates thought to be good taste, but in a different way. First of all, the ship was coated in black paint, and not a soft black to make sure that the ship melded into the night, but a shiny black that shouted its presence even under the slightest light. The spikes on the edges that positioned more for intimidation value rather than anything practical made it even more garish. </p><p>All together, it only lacked an ugly black flag to mark itself as a pirate vessel. Instead, I could see the flag of House Leonay on the main mast, meaning they were most likely privateers -meaning pirates that promised not to attack the ships its flag bearer. Or at least, it wasn’t supposed to, because the crew that filled the ship didn’t fill anyone with confidence. Ten years ago, such a ship couldn’t have qualified for the title of the privateer, but the war against the Frost Mages of the north was still ongoing, and the nobles were feeling the string of their endless raids, enough to allow obvious pirates to operate under their flags.   </p><p>Too late I realized that thinking deeply about the intricacies of international politics wasn’t the best of ideas. In my absentminded state, I had drifted too close to the ship, and as a consequence, rather visible from the deck. Still, it wouldn’t have been a big problem, if it wasn’t for the sudden explosion, followed by a charred body flying off the deck. “God damn it, Gorro,” called a voice from the ship. “How many times I have told you that don’t kill deckhands for stupid reasons.” </p><p>“It wasn’t a stupid reason,” a gruff voice bellowed back. “He was late to serve my food by a full minute.” </p><p>“For fucking siren’s sake, you idiot, the captain is going to gut you when he learns that we’re late because of you. We’re short-staffed as it is, and we need to leave the dock as soon as possible.” </p><p>“No,” answered the gruff voice, this time obviously scared. “Maybe he’s not dead yet.” A moment later, a tall, thick man carrying an equally humongous ax appeared at the edge of the deck, too quick for me to disappear into the crowd. “Maybe not,” he said with a disappointment, before turning his gaze to me. “You,” he bellowed, pointing at me. “You’re recruited, and now you’re a part of Thorn Pira- Privateers,” he said, correcting his words at the last second. “Now, come on board so that we can leave.” </p><p>“Curses,” I murmured, trying to suppress my anger. I had spent three years being assaulted and insulted by a bunch of idiots that didn’t deserve to breathe, and after leaving the school, I was hoping that I had seen the last of it, only to be forcibly recruited by a bunch of pirates. </p><p>Even more galling was I knew I was strong enough to disregard his orders. A flick of my wrist would be enough to call a lightning bolt from the clear skies that would turn him into a crisp, but not only that would put me against a full-sized pirate crew, something I could definitely not defeat. And even if I managed to escape, it would be an explosive affair that would get everyone’s attention, leaving my uncle right to my position. I rather cut my head and send the package to my uncle. At least, it would be painless. </p><p>“I said come on board, you diseased son of a bitch,” called the huge man that was named Gorro.</p><p>“Yes, sir,” I said, and quickly jumped on board. I could have tried my luck to disappear into the crowd, and probably would have succeeded. But a thought kept me in place. After all, that pirate vessel was the perfect excuse for me to disappear, and I could always escape on the next port; which must be rather far away based on the food they were stocking on their ship. </p><p>I saw Gorro’s hand flying towards me the moment my feet pressed the deck. Dodging a telegraphed punch was easy, but also it would also alert everyone on the ship that I was more than a homeless street rat looking for a chance to eat. And attention was bad. So, I waited helplessly until his hand was about to contact my head, and then threw myself on the ground, deflecting as much as the impact as possible. </p><p>“The next time, when I give you an order, follow it immediately,” Gorro said, and after one last kick to my ribs, he turned and left. </p><p>I laid on the ground for a while, acting like I was trying to resist the pain, though I was trying to control my anger. Three years, I had to act like a pathetic bastard in the eyes of the nobles, and playing the same game with the pirates was hardly appealing. Still, it was better than being dead, or trying to avoid my uncle’s patrols in the wilderness. One of the older deckhands walked towards me. “Come on, newbie. Let’s give you a job,” he said, marking the beginning on my new job. </p><p>I stood up, and followed him silently, moderately satisfied despite everything. After all, I had just managed to find a new ship that followed all of my needs, allowing me to escape both the island and my uncle’s trackers without raising any flags. Now, I just needed to keep my head low until we reached to another dock, and disappear silently, starting a new life that wasn’t plagued by murderous uncles and resentful peers.</p><p>How hard could it be to keep a low profile for a few days… </p>",

    "content": "<p>When Penny came back to the living room a few minutes later, I was disappointed to see her choice of clothing. I was hoping for a provocative set of underwear, preferably lace or string, in an attention-grabbing color like bright red, or at least baby blue or soft pink to create an impression of innocence, temping a viewer with the promise that one day, said innocence might disappear. </p><p>Instead, she came down with an ivory-colored teddy, loose enough to even hide her impressive curves. Well, almost managed to hide her curves, if I was being honest, as her breasts still managed to shout their presence through the non-existent cleavage of the top, her ass trying to strain the baggy looseness of her bottom with each step she took. Even her horrible choice wasn’t enough to completely hide her buxom charm. </p><p>Still, I didn’t let those small details affect the expression of sharp disapproval from my face as I looked at her. Under my silence, her shy excitement melted, leaving the only horror behind. “You didn’t like it,” she gasped. </p><p>“What gave it away,” I replied, with a sarcasm thick enough to drown an Olympic swimmer. I turned halfway towards the door. “Maybe I should leave, you are clearly not taking this seriously.” </p><p>“No! No!” she exclaimed in desperation. “I’ll fix whatever you didn’t like. Please give me another chance!” </p><p> I didn’t answer immediately, posing like I had been considering which way to decide, her desperation getting thicker by every second. I even glanced towards the door, which made her eyes widen in panic. “Well, I had to drive all the way here, a few more minutes wouldn’t hurt,” I murmured. </p><p>“Thank you,” she exclaimed as she dashed forward, which cut short when she managed to stumble on my bag, kicking it in the process. </p><p>I sighed while she stammered in panic. Thankfully, the bag was empty, meaning it didn’t ruin anything valuable. I waved off another deluge of stammering apology. “Please go and change while I still have some unbroken equipment,” I murmured. </p><p>She started climbing the stairs rapidly, the sudden movement stretching her teddy enough to give an appealing view of her bottom, which I had a prime view. But halfway in the stairs, she stopped and looked down. “Where are you going?” she said in shock, realizing that I had stepped on the stairs as well.  </p><p>“Coming with you, obviously. After this abomination, I’m not willing to trust your selection.” </p><p>Her lack of willingness towards that idea was obvious, but the several mishaps she had created were equally obvious; some natural, some carefully engineered. She was on thin ice, and she knew that. And when balanced against her longstanding desire to be an actress, it didn’t take long for her to nod obediently before resuming her climb, but this time, considerably slower. I followed, watching the way her hips danced. </p><p>Her blush had turned into a full-fledged furnace when I stepped inside her bedroom. “Where do you keep your underwear?” I asked, ignoring her awkwardness as she pointed a part of the large wardrobe in the room. I walked there, not commenting on her discomfort intentionally, and opened the wardrobe. </p><p>I would have liked to say that I wasn’t disappointed with the view, but that would have been a lie. Unlike what I had been expecting, the teddy she was wearing wasn’t an exception, rather it was towards the revealing end of the spectrum. “Unbelievable,” I murmured. She had curves to die for, and still chose to dress in a burlap sack. And even the ones that were technically-more revealing had uninspired styles, more hindering than helping. Such a waste, cladding that body in these boring pieces. </p><p>“Is that all you have,” I said with a disappointment I hadn’t had to fake. </p><p>“They are all I have,” she answered, but while doing so, her eyes slid down to one of the drawers for a fleeting moment, then jumped away just as quick, marking her as a poor poker player. </p><p>“Are you sure?” I asked, letting my gaze drift towards the same drawer for a moment before meeting with her eyes once more. “Are you absolutely sure that you don’t have anything else that might be a bit more interesting.” </p><p>“I’m - sure,” she stammered, this time, her gaze studiously avoiding the drawer, which made the situation even more obvious. </p><p>I started walking towards the drawer while I spoke. “So, you’re saying that, if I search around, there’s absolutely no chance that I might find something more interesting that might be useful for the shoot.” Then, I stood in front of the drawer, but rather than pulling it open, I turned to her. “Well, we need to cancel the shoot then, what a pity,” I answered with mock disappointment, and started walking towards the door. </p><p>It took a couple of seconds for her to get used to sudden change. “Wait!” she exclaimed. “Can’t we use any of my nightwear?” she asked in desperation. </p><p>“No way, honey, they’re all garbage,” I said, not even slowing down my speed. “It’s a pity though, I had rather high hopes for you.” </p><p>I was about to pass through the door when she called me to wait with an urgent tone once more, and dashed to the same drawer I was standing in front of it moments ago. She opened it with great urgency, and pulled a dark blue, velvet-covered box before dashing towards me. At this point, I wasn’t surprised when she stumbled just a couple of feet away, forcing me to grab her to save her from painful collusion. </p><p>Not the one to miss such a beautiful opportunity, I intentionally grabbed her in an awkward way, and her momentum ended up ripping quite a bit on the top, revealing a glimpse of her breasts, with a hint of her rosy areolas, earning a sexy yelp in the process. “Careful, sweetie,” I said while she stood up once more with a crimson face, doing her best to fix the tear. “So, what’s in the box?” I asked. </p><p>“It’s a gag gift from my friends when I left the town,” she answered rapidly, its quickness enhancing the very attention she was trying to avoid. </p><p>“And you haven’t brought it out until now, because…” I said. </p><p>“I forgot,” she answered, her lie so obvious that even a child wouldn’t have believed in. </p><p>“How … convenient…” I slowly drawled, making sure that she understood her poor attempts to deceive me were noted with great dissatisfaction, pushing her even deeper into the lands of panic. “Why don’t you open it and show me what’s inside.” </p><p>From her trembling fingers, I could guess that the box contained something impressive, but still, it managed to pleasantly surprise me. It was a long nightie, made from an alluring mixture of red and black, designed to entice and enhance rather than cover, a direction supported further by liberal usage of transparent fabrics and a rather aggressive style of cleavage. It had a set of underwear to accompany, but they looked too flimsy to cover Penny’s amazing assets. “Yes, it’s the perfect gag gift,” I quipped. “Very hilarious.” With that, I turned my back and started to walk away. “I’ll be waiting for you downstairs.” </p><p>“You don’t want me to wear that, do you?” she asked in a trembling tone, her blue eyes begging for validation. A hope that I had no problems squashing with a dismissive glare, not even bothering to say anything else as I left her alone in the room and went back downstairs. I would have liked to stay upstairs and watch her change, but it would be a step too far in her current state. </p><p>I had to wait several minutes for her arrival, enough to make me consider another visit upstairs to spell out the situation she had been facing. But before I could, I heard the distinctive clack of a heeled shoe. I looked at the stairs, and watched Penny walking down, dressed in the black and crimson set that I had ordered her to wear. And moreover, she had replaced her makeup with ruby lipstick and dark shades, and completing the femme-fetale feeling with the pair of black stilettos she had chosen. </p><p>“Much better,” I said, which was enough to conjure her shyness back to surface, breaking through her composure, therefore destroying femme-fetale impression she had worked hard to conjure. I failed to prevent a small chuckle from escaping my mouth, one she had missed in her distracted state. “Are you ready for the shoot?” </p><p>“Maybe,” she murmured as she wrapped her arms around her chest. It took both of her arms to hide the sections that weren’t covered by her bra, which had ended just above her nipples, not even covering the entirety of her areolas. And the nightie wasn’t helping at all due to thinness of its transparent fabric. Under the strong spotlights, it almost melted into invisibility. </p><p>Still, that was nothing compared to the tiny size of her panties, leaving her bottom almost completely bare, something she was more than aware of, making her turn her body slightly to avoid my gaze. Even on the front, all it would take was a slightly wider step to reveal her core for my eyes. </p><p>“What do you mean, maybe?” I said with a much sharper tone, making her flinch. “You need to decide before wasting more of my time, honey. I’m a professional, I can’t spend all day coddling you while you’re trying to decide whether you’re serious about being a model or actress. Do you know how many girls there are in this city would do unspeakable things for the chance you have?” </p><p>“Sorry,” she exclaimed, her face blushing further at the mention of unspeakable things, her mind no doubt conjuring a couple of them immediately. “Please don’t go, I want to be an actress. It’s just that…” she murmured, failing to continue. </p><p>“That they are too revealing,” I said in a softer tone, completing the sentence for her. “Don’t worry, these pictures are not going to be seen by anyone else. If you want, I can even delete them the moment we finish the test session,” I said, giving her a promise that I had no intention of keeping. As usual, these photos would take their place in my private collection. </p><p>My lie had worked sufficiently to loosen her nerves, evidenced by her arms, moving back to their natural position, leaving her chest bereft of their protection, which bounced with every step she took, straining the ability of the bra to keep them contained. Apparently, its ability to give support wasn’t prioritized in its design. Unexpectedly, it was not. </p><p>“Do you want to start immediately, or would you like to walk around a few minutes to get used to it first,” I offered her. “It’s important for you to feel comfortable in your clothes to do your best.” She nodded gratefully, missing the implications of such a move. </p><p>“So, when you first decided to become an actress,” I asked her, more to make her feel comfortable rather than any genuine interest, as even before she uttered a word, I could guess her story with great accuracy. That how she admired the glamorous life of the people on television, how she was a special person that couldn’t be contained in the borders of the small town in the middle of nowhere, and how she showed a great skill for acting or singing, evidenced by the great success she had in the workshops taught by a washed-up actress. All she needed was to find an opportunity, and she could launch into the stardom without a hitch. </p><p>I kept an appropriately-awed expression on my face as she told the story on mainly on the lines I had guessed, sprinkled with many useless anecdotes and highlights she assumed as important. She was lucky that it was me that had discovered her, as on the spectrum of predators that feasted on the dreams of hopefuls, I belonged to the most harmless category. In the hands of a typical agent, she would have ended up addicted to drugs and partying, hopelessly turning tricks just to get enough cash to maintain her new glamorous lifestyle before she collapsed in a year or two, with only a couple of minor roles to show for. I actually intended to help her; with a bunch of side benefits for myself, of course…  </p><p>Luckily, listening to her story hadn’t been a complete waste of time. Her story might have been boring and predictable, but her shyness started to melt as she continued to talk while her mind focused on the glamour of the future. As time passed, her movements started to get more heated, which created a rather delicious view to accompany her story, her chest tumbling attractively as she waved her arms enthusiastically, even causing occasional slips that she absentmindedly fixed. </p><p>“Such an inspiring adventure,” I said sarcastically, safe in the knowledge that she would fail to catch it in the excitement of finding a willing ear that ‘understood’ her ‘amazing and difficult’ adventure. I patted her thigh softly, slowly familiarizing her with my touch. “Are you feeling ready for the next step?” I asked, raising my camera once again. </p><p>“Yes,” she said, her nod accompanied by only the slightest blush. Her arms twitched with a desire to cover her chest once more, but this time, she aborted it rather easily. </p><p>“Excellent. Why don’t you stand up in the middle of the room and give me a little twirl.” She followed those orders, and several other simple ones without much trouble. Her acting training might be subpar, but luckily, it seemed that it taught her to follow directions. I crossed my legs subtly to hide my arousals, awakened in the anticipation of what was about to follow. “Now, lean forward just a bit,” I added, making her display more of her rather impressive chest. </p><p>“Am I doing well?” she said after going back to a natural pose, this time, the redness of her face more about excitement than shyness. It seemed that a regular bath of flashes worked wonders in quelling her doubts. </p><p>“Not bad for the starter poses. Now warm-up is over,” I said, making sure to give her a smile to weaken at the discursiveness of my words. “Now, let’s try something a bit more advanced, to see whether you can handle the real thing.\"</p>",
