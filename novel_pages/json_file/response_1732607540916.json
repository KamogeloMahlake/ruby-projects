    "content": "<p>Aria was still trying to put her dress back while Emma finished dressing, and turned to me with a stiff expression. “I’m going to check whether this information is correct. If it’s not…” she said threateningly. </p><p>“If not, what? Are you going to try attacking me again, or will you go and reveal the Queen just how badly you screwed up, giving her the excuse she needs to finally kick you out of the palace?” I countered with a chuckle, which made her flinch. I continued in a gentler tone. “Threats are all about leverage. If that’s lacking, threatening only weakens your position, so take note.” </p><p>Emma nodded in frustration as she fixed her dress one last time and rubbed her face to get rid of the marks of my treatment, washing her face to get rid of the tears on her face. After one last nod, she turned to leave the room, and Aria called her panickedly. “Wait for me!” she begged as she tried to fix her dress. </p><p>As she turned back, Emma didn’t bother to hide her anger. Unlike me, despite all of her political power, Aria was a soft target, and after the nice little delivery she conducted with the paddle, she was an excellent target for Emma’s anger. “Sorry about that, but I’m in a hurry. As a princess, you should understand that the security of the realm is the most important thing.” With that, she walked away confidently and pulled the door open, though the said confidence marred with the pain she felt as she walked away, due to the merciless beating Aria delivered to her tight ass. </p><p>I had to admit, it was a good revenge under the circumstances. She could have easily helped Aria to leave with her, and even if I argued to keep her, she might have used that for trade. Instead, she left Aria to her fate alone with me despite the risk, not even trying to extract her. Impressive, I thought even as Aria stuttered in shock. </p><p>However, it wasn’t the only surprise. I was expecting Aria to either froze in shock, or beg for her to wait. Hence my shock when she raised her hand and cast a spell on Emma. I recognized it, but only thanks to my experience in healing magic. Actually, it was a curse that was useful in combat to prevent a healer to save the target, again and again, blocking simple healing magic to affect them. It was simple for any half-decent healer to dispel, taking only several seconds of concentration. </p><p>By using that on Emma, Aria made sure that Emma couldn’t cure her bottom conveniently through a potion. She either needed to go to a healer and reveal the shameful ‘injury’ she had received, or simply use some herbal ointments to numb the pain and suffer the pain. Emma’ unaware of the curse that settled over her, left the cell, unaware of the discomfort waiting for her. </p><p>“Nice work,” I said to Aria, whose satisfied smile turned shocked as she realized her little trick had been caught. </p><p>“I - I,” she stammered, not expecting to be caught. However, the shame of being caught didn’t last long, not when she remembered her exact state of undress, and pulled the ripped fabrics that remained after my rough treatment to hide her body, clad only in a corset and her panties —and copious amounts of my seed, covering both her face and her body. “Don’t look!” </p><p>I chuckled. “Come on, sweetheart. Isn’t that a bit rude after I have revealed such a big secret just to save you from humiliation,” I answered, which reminded her that the situation was bigger than the carnal experience she had just gone through.</p><p>“If you’re free, why didn’t you just…” she murmured, her voice fading, no doubt trying to ask our little teaching arrangement. </p><p>“Well, what I said was mostly true. My career as a Dark Lord is over, and even if I can escape, doing it without gathering more information is wrong.” </p><p>“Why did you reveal it, then?” she questioned. </p><p>“To make sure that you don’t suffer, of course,” I said as I took a step forward, putting my hand on her chin, my tone husky enough to make her shiver. The blush that covered her whole body was not a surprise, as even under the sanest of circumstances, Aria was vulnerable to charm, her inexperience and social status working against her. And the salacious time we spent together could hardly be classified as normal. </p><p>“I… But…” she murmured, trying to find words, only to fail spectacularly. She was silenced when I put my hand under her chin and raised her to meet my gaze, her lips parted slightly. </p><p>“I think it’s for the best if I accompany you back to your room, just in case someone decides to visit,” I explained. “In your state, explaining it might be difficult.” </p><p>“What if they come and see you’re not in your cell?”</p><p>“That’s a risk I’m willing to take for you. After all, you’re the only one that treated me with kindness after my imprisonment, something I had never experienced before.” I was laying it rather thick, but the shine in her eyes told me that it was the correct direction. </p><p>“T-thanks,” she stammered, though she was quick to be silenced when I grabbed her dress and burned it with a touch. “W-what was that!” </p><p>“Its colors were too bright, and its pieces might have interfered with my concealment spell,” I explained easily, which was without a doubt complete nonsense. Something Aria didn’t miss. </p><p>“Why doesn’t my corset interferes with it, then,” she asked. “It’s bright white.” </p><p>Of course, just like Emma had learned before, it was not a good idea to push with a weak hand. “It does, but I had assumed that you might have problems with it. It’s good to see that you don’t,” I explained even as I reached to her corset, once again pulled it off her body while weakening it my magic, creating a delicious ripping sound, once again revealing her beautiful tits, the hickeys and bite marks I left on unfortunately absent. She must have cured them while trying to dress. </p><p>“But-” she tried to speak as I burned her corset, but silenced when walked behind her and wrapped my arms around her, and cast my shadow trick to wrap around us. </p><p>“The spell is a self-cast one, extending its range is very challenging,” I explained. It wasn’t true, but even if she challenged, she lacked the proper knowledge to understand the intricacies of such a unique concealment spell. </p><p>She didn’t even bother to ask, too distracted by my erection, buried between her cheeks, neither my pants nor her panties enough to blunt the effect. “Let’s walk,” she managed to whisper, surprising me with her obedience. We left the cell together —impossible to otherwise with my arms wrapped around her waist, pinning us together. Just to underline my freedom, I unlocked the first gate by using the unique magical pattern required, which I learned by observing Emma last night. “You really could have escaped,” she gasped, like she was just now properly processing that particular fact. </p><p>“Of course,” I answered, and since I was already shocking her, I had decided to raise my arms a bit, so that my arms were resting just under her tits, enjoying their weight. She stiffened as I did so, but said nothing. Not entirely unreasonable considering everything we had already done. “Which way?” I asked after I have led her out of the confusing labyrinth and reached close to Emma’s location. </p><p>“To the - right,” she said, stammering halfway as I grabbed her tits without a warning. </p><p>“Press your back tighter,” I said as I pulled her closer, which was rather ridiculous as far as the excuses went, but it was even more fun. Even after passing the secret entrance to Emma’s room, we walked for a couple of minutes, highlighting the Queen’s efforts to discard Emma. With her achievements, Emma’s residence needed to be closer to the private section of the royals. </p><p>Of course, the distance was important to me for something much more important. It gave me the opportunity to tease Aria further. She was already aroused thanks to the after-effects of the treatment she had received, my insistent massage to her sensitive breasts, caressing and mauling alternatively, didn’t help her to calm down. Just to tease her some more, I decided to speak. “I think I heard something,” I whispered even as I pushed against the wall, my weight pinning her against the cold stone. </p><p>“I didn’t hear-” she whispered, but I closed her mouth with my hand. </p><p>“Silent,” I whispered even as I stayed pressed against her, my shaft lodged between her cheeks suggestively. Of course, even as we stood like that, my hand moved down, clamping around her panties. “This is also white, so we should play it safe,” I murmured even as I ripped them off, finally leaving her with only her shoes. </p><p>She didn’t say anything, trembling under my touch as the time passed. I only let her move after a minute, and when she pulled back, her nipples were rock hard thanks to the cold wall. “You’re shivering, let me help you warm up,” I whispered as I cupped her tits once more, mauling them as we walked. </p><p>“T-thanks,” she stammered, more of a reflex than a genuine response, which I liked immensely. </p><p>“Of course, as a valiant protector, that’s a part of my role,” I whispered.  </p><p>She said nothing, but her hips followed my rhythm as she walked toward her room, but each step getting harder. I had a feeling that if I suddenly let her go, she wouldn’t break contact between our bodies, not that I wanted to test that. </p><p>Then, we arrived at her room. “We’re here,” she said even as she unlocked the secret entrance, either uncaring or not thinking that I learned how to do that for her room —not that I couldn’t have figured out in a few minutes, so it wasn’t exactly impressive. </p><p>“Sure, aren’t you going to offer me some drink for my efforts to protect you?” I said even as I took a step forward, still mauling her chest. </p><p>“Umm, maybe,” she murmured, but we were already in her room before she could finish her short sentence. </p><p>“Nice place,” I murmured as I walked forward toward her bed, my arms still around her body. It was a huge room, filled with expensive furniture and protected with layers of magical protection, not that it mattered as I accessed the room through the most important secret passage, only using it in reverse. All told, a rather horrible design flaw.  </p><p>“Let me get you a drink-” she started to say, only to leave its place to a panicked gasp when I pushed her on the bed. </p><p>“Sure, but let’s give you a massage first, you’re rather tense since we left the cell,” I said even as I pressed my hands on her back, caressing softly. While she tried to stammer a reply, I focused on her neck and her shoulders, making her purr reflexively. </p><p>“No need-” she tried to say, only to let out a moan as I found a particularly sensitive spot along her spine, trailing down as she tried to suppress her moan. If it wasn’t for the amazing encounter back in the cells, I would have massaged her for hours, until she started begging for me to take her, offering me the keys of the Empire as a reward. Unfortunately, as much as I would have liked to spend hours teasing her, I was already risking quite a lot by deserting my cell. Of course, that didn’t mean that I would just turn and leave while Aria was trembling with unmet arousal, especially without an Emma to trick, allowing me to enjoy the moment completely. </p><p>Rather than continuing to massage her gently, I flipped her so that her beautiful tits were pointing at the ceiling, and crouched between her legs, assaulting her delicious folds with my tongue. Circling around her knot, it triggered a rather loud moan, but from the way her legs tightened, I could feel that she was shocked by the action itself. “I’m paying you back for the amazing show you have put on trying to convince Emma,” I said. “Your amazing blowjob performance deserves a reward.” </p><p>She failed to come up with an answer against my satisfied smirk, and soon, it was impossible for her to actually to do so, because I let my tongue free, raiding and invading every sensitive spot between her legs, teaching her a new meaning of the pleasure. Though, she managed to surprise me when she grabbed my hair, especially when she tried to pull me closer rather than trying to push me away. It would be a lie if I said that I didn’t feel proud. Despite everything I had achieved during my previous career, none was as outrageous as giving a delicious treatment to the princess of the largest realm of the light faction. In her own room, even, just to underline the audacity of my achievement further. </p><p>She gasped and moaned as I pushed her steadily toward a climax, so much that she didn’t register as I removed my clothes, matching her in nakedness. She did gasp in shock when I added my fingers to the assault of my tongue, dancing at the entrance aggressively. Her lack of resistance was a mistake, of course, one that would take a while for her to truly comprehend. She danced and crawled under my touch, her moans breaking through her capability to stay silent. </p><p>The addition of my fingers pushed her steadily toward a climax, but just as she was about to achieve that, I slowed down. The previous frantic assault had suddenly tapered into a gentle massage, her speedy climb stopped by an unexpected avalanche, cutting off her path. </p><p>I wondered just how long she would be able to resist being delayed on the edge… </p><p>The answer turned out to be not too long, because before even a minute could pass, she whispered gently. “Please,” she murmured. </p><p>I chuckled, the rumbling of my laugh directly delivered to her entrance as I kept my lips pressed against her wetness, making her tremble in desperation. “Please, what?” I asked lazily. </p><p>“Mercy,” she gasped. “Let me… Let me…” she said, trying to complete, but failing to complete her sentence. It was funny that even after everything we had done, she couldn’t ask for me to help her cum. </p><p>“You want to cum?” I asked, not bothering to hide my amusement as I stood up, giving her a view of my naked stature. She nodded. “Use your words, princess,” I warned her.</p><p>“Yes,” she gasped. She might have managed to answer normally, if I hadn’t used the opportunity to dig my fingers into her entrance to continue teasing her, keeping her on the edge. </p><p>“You want me to make sure you cum? Are you sure?” I repeated even as I sat next to her, one hand still teasing her entrance while the other hand found her deliciously perky tits. I focused on her trembling blue eyes, and repeated my question. “Are you sure?” </p><p>“Yes,” she moaned, half-delirious with pleasure, folding even easier than I expected. It seemed that finally getting a taste of the pleasures she had been denied worked wonders to suppress her rationality. </p><p>I was prepared to get a full taste of her beauty. </p><p>The question, just how far I should go? </p>",

    "content": "<p>“So, this is our new home. I can’t believe it,” Lillian asked curiously even as I led them inside the house, which was in surprisingly good condition considering its age. The furnishing hadn’t survived of course, nor did the windows and the doors. However, creating workable alternatives was ridiculously easy for my skill level, so I was happy. </p><p>“This place is so big,” Astrid said from another room as she moved around. </p><p>“Of course it is big, it’s a proper Roman Villa,” Lillian answered, surprisingly, with no hint of derision or dismissal in her tone. Just days ago, every little interaction she had with Astrid was tinged with a hint of superiority, but it had disappeared somewhere between my surprising Ascension, and their relationship seemed to deepen even more after the escape from the trading post. </p><p>What Lillian said was true. This place was a proper Roman villa, one that any Equites would be proud to have, especially considering it was constructed by magical white marble, one of the most precious building materials. It was on the smaller size for the Patrician families, but considering those households hold tens of members —hundreds if one counted the servants and slaves as well— being found lacking on that particular area wasn’t a problem. Like any proper Roman Villa, the building was like a hallowed square, creating a connected web of rooms, while also creating a private inner garden away from any prying eyes. </p><p>A perfect location to have some private time in the heat of the summer. </p><p>Frankly, it wasn’t the best choice of architecture for a mountaintop villa, but considering the reason for construction, I wasn’t surprised. They wanted to stay stylistically connected to Rome, just to underline their own legitimacy. </p><p>I walked through the rooms, just checking them for any possible traps or signs of decay that might create a danger above the capabilities of the girls. The town was an interesting find, but that didn’t suddenly mean that I was safe. As a Sorcerer, I was able to find myself in the chaotic field of the mountain, so I wasn’t unreachable. And facing against two Sorcerers, I was certainly not untouchable. Even just one Sorcerer experienced in combat —something a Centurion would definitely have— was an unknown challenge. I had limited combat experience even against other peak mages. </p><p>So, I aimed to leave the ruins after getting a bit of a rest. </p><p>Of course, no one said I couldn’t rest in style, I thought with a wide smirk, enthusiastically examining the last room I had entered, which was a bathhouse. </p><p>It was a proper one that was fit to be used by multiple people, and since it was built mostly from marble, it was close to prime condition. A controlled wind spell funneled all the dust out of the bath, and creating a runic scheme to conjure water and warm it appropriately took minutes, easily achievable thanks to the thick background magic, calmed by the presence of the wards. </p><p>“Fucking finally,” I murmured as I slipped into the warm embrace of the water, enjoying both the exhaustion and the dirt flowing away from my body, but bubbling water kept clear thanks to another simple runic scheme. It was especially relaxing after spending the last two days wading through mud and rain, trying to avoid a full cohort of professional soldiers, supported by some very skilled mages. </p><p>A bath was a true luxury. </p><p>I was so relaxed that I didn’t bother to open my eyes, not even when the footsteps neared, easily recognizing Lillian’s particular walk. I put that out of my mind when she walked away just like that, glad that she left me to rest. Even the temptation of her beautiful body was not enough to break my rest. I kept my eyes closed, trying to drift into the warm embrace of a nap… </p><p>That aim was disrupted several minutes later, when I heard footsteps closing in once more, this time two pairs of them. But my dissatisfaction was dispelled in an instant when I heard a playful giggle from Lillian as Astrid whispered something, suddenly realizing that they weren’t there to ask my help about the house. While the temptation of Lillian’s beautiful body was not enough to change my mind, the same wasn’t true for Lillian and Astrid together. </p><p>I cracked my eyes open just as I felt them sliding into the bath. The first thing I noticed was Astrid’s beautiful bosom, bobbing on the surface of the water, hidden behind a very interesting approximation of underwear, made from white fabric, which immediately turned half-transparent as it sank into the water, her crimson hair spilling freely on her shoulders. Lillian was next to her, wearing equally small underclothes, its impact only second to Astrid’s delicious show. </p><p>“It’s a very nice bath,” Lillian drawled lazily. “I can see why you prioritized repairing it.” Her words would have felt like a passive-aggressive assault, but her tone was the complete opposite, clearly enjoying the water jets even more than me. Her back arched lazily, or more accurately, would have been termed as lazily if she was wearing anything other than a wet piece of cloth barely wider than my hand, stretching dangerously. </p><p>“Yes, a very good idea,” Astrid answered as she followed Lillian’s direction, stretching as well. Unlike Lillian, her motion was a bit more mechanical, checking Lillian to see if she had done it correctly, revealing that they had actually coordinated in that. I acted unawares, enjoying the way her white top stretched even further, threatening to be ripped in half under the heavyweight of her bosom. I was far too curious about their sudden plan to seduce me to interrupt them. </p><p>“Even with the water, my back is still stiff,” Lillian murmured before looking at Astrid. “Do you mind rubbing my shoulders?” </p><p>“Of course not,” Astrid answered and Lillian moved to press her back against Astrid’s chest while Astrid put her hands on Lillian’s shoulders, and started squeezing softly. Lillian moaned in relief, far more than what should have been required from such a light touch. I expected Astrid to move down immediately to further their ploy of seduction, but surprisingly, her hands stayed firmly on Lillian’s shoulders, while Lillian’s moans got louder and louder, not bothering to hide their sensual nature. I kept watching, partly because I was curious about their ultimate aim, partly because I was enjoying the show immensely. </p><p>Though, my determination to stay observer was challenged when Astrid’s hands finally left their post, first trailing down Lillian’s back, making her back arc once more, accentuating her delicious breasts. My heartbeat climbed as Astrid ‘carelessly’ touched Lillian’s underwear, making it slid down to enhance Lillian’s cleavage further, deliciously framed with water droplets. </p><p>However, just as I was starting to hope that the show was about to pick up speed, Lillian spoke. “Now, it’s your turn,” she said to Astrid as she pulled back, fixing her top. They both turned, so that Astrid’s back was resting against Lillian’s chest, but it caused a major problem! I could only see their backs, especially horrible since their lower half was buried under the bubbles, hiding the only good aspect of such a pose. </p><p>It seemed to be Lillian’s intention as well, if her playful smirk was any indicator. She rubbed Astrid’s shoulders, while the voluptuous redhead took the task of moaning enticingly. It would be a lie to say that I wasn’t tempted to rush forward and educate them on the risks of teasing me like this, but I kept myself back, not wanting to surrender easily to their attempts of teasing.</p><p>Also, watching them slowly caress each other with the sole purpose of arousing me was a unique show, and it would be a pity to miss it. </p><p>Lillian hadn’t lost much time before removing her top and giving me a view of her naked back, supported by the glimpse of the side view of her breasts whenever she moved, but that was just the start of her plan. After throwing her water-logged top to the side, her hands found Astrid’s transparent top, and slowly slid it off her body as Astrid raised her arms. Unlike Lillian’s more modest —but still large— bosom, Astrid’s amazing tits didn’t require her to turn to give a glimpse of its curves, especially when she was pressing her chest against the marble walls of the bath. </p><p>Still, no matter how amazing the show, I was determined to watch passively. But like she was reading my mind, Lillian was quick to challenge that particular detail. “You are so tense,” Lillian murmured into Astrid’s ear before pressing her lips to her neck, leaving a trail of kisses that made her moans more intense, and my shaft harder. She was playing dirty. </p><p>“Maybe you can move lower,” Astrid managed to say between moans, which were starting to lose their artificial quality further as the time passed. </p><p>“Like this,” Lillian said as she started kissing her shoulders, but the more interesting shift was her hands, moving to Astrid’s front, sliding her palms on her chest. Astrid moaned as Lillian squeezed, the last bits of acting finally melting down as she squirmed under Lillian’s touch. </p><p>“You girls seem to be getting along very well,” I quipped, trying to keep my voice even, but unable to prevent it from hitching a bit. </p><p>Lillian twisted her neck to look at me, her tits still pressing Astrid’s back to hide her frontal nakedness the sexiest way possible, her fingers comfortably sinking into her bosom. A naughty grin blossomed on her face as she spoke. “During the escape, we finally managed to find a common ground. Huddled in a small cave just two of us, wet and trembling, and without the presence of our protector, not knowing whether we’ll be able to see the morning… It’s hard to go through such a dangerous ordeal without getting close.” </p><p>“And you two are definitely close,” I answered, unable to keep my laugh in as Lillian pressed even tighter as she molested Astrid’s chest, far too enthusiastically to be just a ploy to seduce me. Apparently, the suspicions of the male students back when we were in the school were more accurate than we had initially presumed in terms of how the girls spent their time back in their private section.</p><p>It was one of the biggest dilemmas I had ever faced in my life, whether to keep watching their amazing show or move forward, using the perfect angle to take Lillian from behind, turning their playful game into a threesome. In the end, however, no matter how hard my shaft throbbed in anticipation, the former won, and not just because I wanted to watch the show —and I did, very much. I also wanted to have a better understanding of their new dynamic so that I could feel confident leaving them alone as I went exploring. </p><p>I could feel that the lost city wasn’t the only secret of the Mount Pyrenaean, if that was the case, Julius Caesar wouldn’t have chosen it as the location for its secret base. I have no illusion of the risks I would face exploring it, making it unfeasible to bring the girls with me. Knowing that they wouldn’t draw their knives the moment I turn my back was comforting. </p><p>Lillian turned several times to share a naughty smile as she massaged Astrid’s amazing bosom and delivered layers of kisses on her sensitive neck, making her moans louder and louder. Said moans suddenly gained a deeper quality when one of Lillian’s hands disappeared underwater, her shoulder twisting repeatedly. </p><p>I had expected that to be the end of their little game, but after one last teasing smile, Lillian suddenly sank underwater, and Astrid cried desperately, her hands clamping on the edge of the bath to keep herself upright. It didn’t take a genius to understand what Lillian was doing underwater, but her initiative surprised me greatly. Though, from her frantic reaction, it was likely that I wasn’t the only one that was surprised, not that either of us had any problem with that particular surprise. </p><p>Lillian stayed underwater for a full minute as Astrid moaned and grunted, climbing steadily toward a climax of her own, only to gasp disappointingly when Lillian pulled up to breathe, gasping greatly. “Try to sit on the edge of the bath, it’ll make it easier,” I recommended to Astrid with a smirk, betting on the fact that she was far too gone to remember that it was a ploy to tease me. </p><p>Astrid said nothing as she pulled herself out of the water, finally giving me a beautiful glimpse of her thick bottom, adorned with a rain of droplets. Lillian sighed exaggeratedly as we shared a look, though her own arousal was impossible to hide, so much that, when Astrid finally sat on the edge of the bed and parted her legs to give us a perfect view of her full-frontal nudity, Lillian didn’t bother to tease me as she moved, her head firmly positioned between her legs. </p><p>My eyes stayed glued on the amazing show, Lillian eating Astrid with great fervor, while Astrid’s wet breasts heaved greatly, pointing upward as she arched her back, her arms pressing on the cold floor in a desperate attempt to keep herself upright. Watching Lillian as she mauled and teased Astrid with a surprising familiarity was always nice, pushing Astrid closer and closer to a climax. Soon, Astrid grabbed Lillian’s hair, pulling her tighter even as her legs started to clench, signaling Lillian’s great success. </p><p>Trying to stay upright with her orgasm, Astrid was not in a position to resist as Lillian pulled her back into the water, or when she smashed her lips —still stained with her arousal— in a searing kiss. I watched with growing arousal as they shared the kiss that started tender, but quickly climbed to a level of deep arousal, their chest pressing against each other. </p><p>As much as I wanted to join, watching two naked girls sharing an enthusiastic yet tender kiss while their delicious bodies were on display was something special, especially when considering one of them was an impeccable noble heiress and the other was a barbarian priestess, like it was a poorly imagined story told in a bar… Except it was entirely real, and entirely delicious… </p><p>Things got even more heated when two hands disappeared under the water, one of each, their shoulders twisting furiously, immediately followed by an increase of passion in their kiss, turning into an irresistible temptation… As the seconds ticked, their kiss getting more and more heated, surrendering started to sound more and more tempting. </p><p>Then, before I could make a move, Astrid suddenly pulled out of the kiss, and whispered something to Lillian’s ear, who let out a delicious mixture of moan and giggle in response, and then, they swam next to me. “It seems that you need a massage as well,” Astrid whispered into my ear even as my shoulder buried under the soft weight of her bosom. </p><p>“Without a doubt,” Lillian completed even as she repeated the maneuver, and suddenly, I felt a pair of hands on my chest, and they started traveling down. I leaned back in the anticipation of an amazing massage service…</p>",

    "content": "<p>There was something special in being naked in the middle of the wilderness, maintaining a defensive line while simultaneously impaling a sexy redhead, whose moans echoing against the nearby hills even as waves of flames spilling out of her hands like an angry goddess. </p><p>An angry goddess that was being defiled by a demon even as she incinerated another wave of monsters… </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 94%]</p><p>Suddenly, her moans were interrupted by another slap on her tight ass. “Try casting the flame arrow again,” I ordered as I watched the majority of the monster wave burn into cinders, along with their potential magical materials, but I didn’t care much. None of the monsters that attacked during the current wave were particularly valuable. There were a few during the previous waves, but I had carefully picked them off by using an earth spell, shielding them from Cornelia’s flames to make sure their properties weren’t ruined. </p><p>Cornelia concentrated —as much as she could while she was being fucked relentlessly while also trying to accommodate rapid invasion of four fingers anally—to make three distinct sources of flame appear, floating inches away from her face before they started wrapping each other as they grow. She bit her lips to contain a moan as I chose that moment to change the pace a bit, and pulled out of her tight tunnel, only to invade her puckered hole with my shaft. </p><p>Impressively, she managed to maintain control of the flame arrow, and even directed it toward a wounded monster about twenty feet away, killing it easily. “I did it,” she gasped in elation. </p><p>“You did it,” I approved. Technically, the spell construction was shoddy and unbalanced, making it impossible for her to target anything farther than fifty feet, but I decided to let it slide. She had just learned the spell, after all, not to mention she was trying to cast it under some really challenging conditions. “Now, it’s time for a reward-” I started, only to be interrupted by an earth-shattering roar, and the ground started to shake. </p><p>I was already summoning an air elemental as a humongous creature appeared in the sky, diving toward us. The creature was larger than an elephant, with the body shape of a lion, but with wings reminiscent of a bat and a tail filled with poisonous needles. </p><p>A manticore. How convenient.</p><p>Manticores were creatures deserving of their infamy. Technically, an adult manticore could reach up to class thirty, which turned it into a veritable danger. Even an immature one like we were facing was just below class twenty, which technically meant that it shouldn’t be about as strong as a golden lion. Unfortunately, that wasn’t the case. The monster classification was measured based on the experience the monster generated, which in turn was determined by the strength and stability of a soul space of a monster. Indeed, in terms of pure power or melee combat, a golden lion could easily rival a young manticore. </p><p>However, for a Manticore, there was no such thing as a fair fight for a manticore. Both its bite and its tail was covered by a deadly venom, a bite enough to kill a dire elephant in minutes. The venom in its tail spikes was weaker, but even more dangerous considering it can use them as a ranged weapon, each shake of its tail spreading eight-inch pointy bone needles, sharp enough to penetrate nonmagical steel plates, delivering their venom if the initial penetration hadn’t already slain the target. Add in its great mobility due to its flying ability, and a thick mane to protect its vitals, no doubt people were scared of it. </p><p>It wasn’t all bad, however. While the experience reward it bequeathed might be subpar compared to the sheer danger it presented, the value of its magical materials more than compensated for it. Killing it would make sure that I had reached the target for the day. I could have killed it easily, but why would I, when I could conveniently use it as an opportunity to finally complete the companion process. And if the bonus she received was good enough, maybe she could even take it down her own. </p><p>Cornelia gasped in shock as she tried to pull back, but I grabbed her waist and hoisted her on top of my elemental mount, keeping her on my lap, and using the opportunity to slide back in her warm tunnel. “Don’t worry about defending, but killing it is your job,” I whispered into her ear. “Prove to me that I didn’t waste my time by leveling you up and educating you.” </p><p>“I will,” she gasped determinedly even as she raised her hand, conjuring a flame spear while I directed the fake air elemental to lift off. Manticores could fly, but luckily, a young one didn’t have the agility of a mature one in the air. As a result, Cornelia easily nailed it with her flame spear, making it roar in pain.  </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 97%]</p><p>I didn’t stop flying, a decision that was vindicated when the manticore appeared from the cloud of smoke, slightly singed. If it was easy to take down it by a simple fire spell, they wouldn’t have their fearsome reputation, after all. Cornelia followed her initial attack by an even more impressive display, conjuring three flame spears at the same time, but the result was still the same —except creating a bigger cloud of smoke. </p><p>The manticore responded by a rain of its deadly needles, but I conjured a tornado counter it, easily pushing them away. With over forty charisma, the strength of my spells had gone through another qualitative transformation, so much that I could actually hope to rival Titania as long as we fought in an open space, where I could leverage my superior mobility and regeneration. Not a bad improvement speed. </p><p>[-26 Mana]</p><p>However, as much as I enjoyed my own power-up, I couldn’t be at the forefront always, so the girls needed to be stronger. “Think,” I commanded even as I grabbed Cornelia’s hips and lifted her a bit, only to pull her down and skewer her deep once again, delivering her some extra mana at the same time. “You need to bypass the magical resistance of its skin. Use the spell I had thought you.” </p><p>[-436 Mana]</p><p>“But I can barely cast it,” she countered. </p><p>“Luckily for you, it’s the perfect opportunity to practice it,” I said, which earned an incredulous glare from her. But I just smirked, and soon, she nodded in acceptance. I decided to cut her some slack, and stopped pumping inside her, though I was still inside her, enjoying her snug warmth, her wetness spilling to my lap. “Prove me just how good you are! Prove to me that you deserve to be the heiress of your family!” </p><p>“I will!” she shouted, her resolve finally solidified. She raised her hand, trying to conjure the special flame arrow I had taught her. It failed, but she didn’t stop and continued to try, again and again. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 98%]</p><p>On her fifth try, she managed to stabilize it enough to touch the skin of the manticore. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 99%] </p><p>At her ninth try, her every repeat was finally hitting its skin, even though it was yet to penetrate its skin. “Good try, just a bit more,” I said, declaring my trust, enhancing the impact of my words with the full impact of my charisma, which raised her morale into a fanatical frenzy. </p><p>Her eyes shone brightly. “Take this, you bastard,” she cried even as she conjured another flame arrow, shining bright. It slammed at the chest of the manticore, finally penetrating its skin, making it roar in pain, its sound mixing with Cornelia’s gloating cry. Not one to miss such a precious opportunity, I suddenly picked up speed, slamming inside her hard enough to trigger her climax, making her cry in pleasure, mixing with my own satisfied grunt as I painted her insides with my seed.  </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 100% - Final Stage Completed +20000 Exp]</p><p>[New Perk: Empowerment (1/1)]</p><p>Level UP!</p><p>[Select one of the following skills: Grandmaster Elemental (5), Grandmaster Melee (5), Advanced Speech] </p><p>I barely needed to think before picking up my next skill. Increasing my combat abilities was never bad, but with my impending meeting with the mysterious headmistress, a better verbal ability would no doubt be more convenient. </p><p>Meanwhile, Cornelia moaned in a shocking joy, but before I could examine the changes in her soul space, she raised her hand, and conjured three flame arrows at the same time, each strong enough to easily penetrate through the Manticore’s skin. “Yes! Take that!” she exclaimed in joy as she conjured another trio, this time wounding one of its wings enough to force it to land. </p><p>I examined her soul space, only to meet with three big surprises at the same time. In the first place, the vision of her soul space was much clearer. It almost felt like I was meditating to examine my own power. The second surprise was her new achievement, feeling much stronger than the others. Since it was somehow linked to my power, I was easily able to understand its power. Five full points of enhancement for her every mental stat, and two stats for every physical stat. No wonder her casting abilities suddenly increased by such a wide margin. It was hard to overstate the impact of twenty-five new mental stats, especially for someone like Cornelia who already had respectable stats. </p><p>However, even that couldn’t rival the sudden sensation of connection that filled my being. Cornelia was clearly unaware of it, lacking my sensitivity to the nature of her soul space, missing the sudden channel that appeared between us, establishing a connection that persisted even when after I stopped using my tantric abilities, getting stronger each passing second. </p><p>[Permanent Perk Established: Mana Regeneration]</p><p>[Permanent Perk Established: Skill Share]</p><p>The notification I received was certainly convenient. The mana regeneration, in particular, had been vital in my rapid development, but its relatively short cooldown had been limiting my ability significantly. Its permanency meant that I was finally able to roam around however I wanted —of course, that required the permanency to not to have any range restrictions, but I hoped for it to be the case. </p><p>While my attention was split between examining the still-changing nature of our connection and the potential implications of my new benefits, Cornelia continued to rain the flames of retribution on the wounded Manticore, intent on completely eviscerate it. Luckily, the Manticore was much more agile on the ground, so it avoided most of Cornelia’s attacks. If all of them had connected, it would have ruined the magical value of the manticore. </p><p>However, the real surprise came from when I suddenly received another wall of notification, suddenly appearing in front of me. </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 17/21 - 46% </p><p>Skills: Legendary Fire Magic (1/10), Master Arcana, Advanced Mana Manipulation</p><p>Perks: None</p><p>Strength: 6 / Precision: 9 / Agility: 7 / Speed: 7 / Endurance: 6  </p><p>Charisma: 26 / Perception 18 / Manipulation: 22 / Intelligence: 14 / Wisdom: 16</p><p>HP:  481 / 595 — Mana: 724 / 1632 ]</p><p>I finally had a direct connection to Cornelia’s abilities, rather than inferring them from the impressions in her soul space, one that I could easily call without any effort on my part. Along with it, I could feel her current state of being, and even divine her location from a great distance. All around a very convenient upgrade. </p><p>It only left one thing to try, the last perk I had received. Empowerment. </p><p>Instinctively, I could feel that it wasn’t a perk that I could use on my own. No, it was designed for an external recipient. With the ease of a mental flick, I activated it, dropping its counter from one to zero. </p><p>A mysterious light covered Cornelia in an instant, her aura transforming completely. Her spells started to burn with the all might of a miniature sun, with a power that even I wouldn’t be able to rival… Her spells, flying with a much greater speed, connected with the manticore, burning it to cinders. </p><p>[Achievement: Celestial Company. Elevate your companions to the next level give them the right to be on the same plane of existence as you. +3 to all stats. +15000 Experience]</p><p>[Select one of the following skills: Grandmaster Elemental (5), Grandmaster Tantric (5), Master Subterfuge] </p><p>Cornelia’s enhanced abilities were interesting, almost as much as the incredible achievement I had received —both in terms of the strength it brought, and the implications of the text. However, I didn’t pay attention to them except quickly selecting Subterfuge skill for my development. </p><p>No, my full attention was on Cornelia, doing my best to stop my new perk, because I could feel Cornelia burning up under the sudden rush of power, ravaging her soul space. It took me just seconds to do so, and the moment the power stopped, Cornelia collapsed like a puppet without strings. I dashed toward her, pushing my mana to analyze her soul space… </p><p>Only to find a scene of utter devastation, the borders weakened and damaged, her achievements and skills dislodged. Using my new connection just confirmed her status. </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 15/16 - 21%] </p><p>She had lost two levels, and her level cap had dropped. With her achievements roaming freely, even her stats had dropped. </p><p>Luckily for her, I already had the solution for her. I dragged her to the nearest cave and established a defensive parameter around before injecting my mana, starting the most complicated operation of my life. First, I reinforced the borders of her soul space to stop corruption, then stabilized her skills and achievements, preventing them from being lost. In comparison, neither her level nor her level cap was as important, not when I could boost them, a task that got even easier thanks to our permanent connection. </p><p>The next three hours passed in utter concentration, but as a result, not only her skills and achievements were completely cured, but I also reinforced her soul space to be even stronger than before, and using my spare mana to give back her levels. </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 17/25 - 83%] </p><p>Though, I have learned that increasing the level capacity also had a limit. It seemed to be one level lower than my own. Logical, if slightly inconvenient. </p><p>After the operation finished, I collapsed next to Cornelia, breathing hard. Even for me, operating continuously for three hours without a break was not a simple thing to achieve. Once again, I could feel the signs of mana overuse straining my body. Luckily, it wasn’t as bad as before. </p><p>I waited a few minutes for my mana to recover before conjuring a mount and going back to the school, carrying a naked Cornelia in the bridal hold, her robe lost during the latest debacle. As I traveled, I couldn’t help but think about the implications of my newest perk, which was even more mysterious than my other abilities, and its link with the word ‘Celestial’ was definitely suspicious. I could feel that with every achievement related to my unique abilities, I was getting closer to some big secret, but without reliable information, I was just fumbling helplessly… Maybe I should take the risk and raid Titania’s special vault. </p><p>I met with another surprise when I arrived at school. The battle wards had been activated, covering the surrounding area with a dangerous spell. Before finding the defensive schematics in the necromancers’ base, it would have taken me quite a while to sneak into the school with the wards in full alert, but using the weak areas Helga identified, I achieved that with disturbing ease. Disturbing, because it highlighted just how defenseless we were against a necromancer assault. </p><p>Dropping Cornelia in her room was even easier. But when I tried to clean her up with a quick shower, she finally woke up. “What happened?” she slurred. “I remember a bright power, followed by some explosions, then darkness…” </p><p>“Nothing much, sweetie. Just some backlash from excessive mana usage. Your body is not used to handle that much power, especially you haven’t get used to your new achievement yet,” I explained to her even as I helped her to clean up, for once not using the opportunity for some shower fun. Both of us were exhausted. “Just make sure that you don’t use any magic for the next day. I’ll visit again in the evening for another check-up.” </p><p>“Thanks,” she slurred with a cute smile, drunkenly. “You’re the best master…” </p><p>“That I am,” I said with a chuckle, amused with her changes. Paradoxically, the stronger she got, the more accepting she started to get about her own role… I helped her to change into a long nightgown before leaving, also dropping a note by Marianne to take care of Cornelia during the day, just in case. </p><p>After that, I was planning to get some sleep —and maybe developing my Speech and Subterfuge a bit— before trying to find the headmistress, but on the way back to my room, I realized that one of the dead drop locations had been activated. </p><p>Titania was finally back, and she was asking for an emergency meeting… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 26    Experience: 331900 / 351000 </p><p>Strength: 31    Charisma: 44</p><p>Precision: 27    Perception: 30</p><p>Agility: 28     Manipulation: 33</p><p>Speed: 26       Intelligence: 37</p><p>Endurance: 25      Wisdom: 36</p><p>HP: 3513 / 3562 Mana: 3210 / 4680        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Master Subterfuge [75/100]         </p><p>Expert Arcana [75/75]        </p><p>Advanced Speech [25/50]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 17/25] </p>",

    "content": "<p>As much as I wanted to explore the mystery of a second earth gem I had extracted from the magical tortoise who had been busy leading a horde moments ago —and now, busy being overcooked— I needed to act. I instantly conjured another elemental mount.</p><p>“Are we leaving?” Cornelia asked, shocked. “But that was a horde. The reputation from destroying it singlehandedly would-” she tried to continue, only for me to cut her off. </p><p>“It would make sure we would die under the blade of an assassin,” I cut in even as I pulled her on the elemental, and surged forward. </p><p>“What! And why are we in such a hurry?” she asked, her voice mixing with the wind created by our speed, high enough to give her whiplash. I didn’t even bother removing the evidence, just spending a second to dispel the remaining runes. The other monsters would soon come for the cooked meat, messing up the already complicated scene more, not that the still burning inferno left a lot of evidence behind. </p><p>“Because the spell I used is hard to classify as discrete, especially in the middle of the night, sweetheart,” I explained. “The necromancers would soon discover our location either way, but only if the school doesn’t react to it first.” </p><p>“Why does it matter if the necromancers know it was you?” Cornelia asked. “It’s not like they can hunt you this close to the school.” </p><p>“You would be surprised,” I murmured, pausing for a moment to weigh in the pros and cons of telling Cornelia about the true overreach of the necromancers, and came on the side of openness. First of all, she had already seen the evidence of their presence, and her knowing the full extent of it was better than going half-assed and getting discovered. I didn’t want her to disappear in the middle of the night, not after all the effort I had put into developing her. </p><p>More importantly, she was already aware of some of my more important secrets, and after my incredible achievement of allowing her to level up and eye-catching performance of destructive fire, she both trusted me and relied on me. Add in our physical relationship and her emotional reliance, I didn’t have a reason to keep it a secret. So, for the next five minutes, I gave her a brief breakdown of the necromancer presence, including the secret army camp and possible spies. </p><p>“They can’t have spies in the school,” she gasped. “That is…” </p><p>“Impossible,” I completed in a deadpan tone. “Honey, believe me, not only it’s possible, but it’s not even that difficult. Consider just how easily we had slipped away today with our own skills. Now, add the possibility of a high-level insider, and we have a true clusterfuck in hand.”  </p><p>“Are you sure we have a spy among the faculty,” she asked. </p><p>“Almost certainly,” I countered. Technically, it was possible that the shade I had destroyed after it scouted the library was an excellent example of double-bluff that was designed to seed distrust between the professors, it was not very likely, especially since it had already happened before I had started ruining their big plans, and they had chosen a night when Titania was absent. </p><p>“So, we know that we can trust the head librarian, the headmistress, and no one else?” Cornelia asked. </p><p>“Yeah, and the latter only because the school would have already fallen if she was an agent of the death cults. We’re trusting her, because if we can’t trust her, we already lost the battle before it started.” </p><p>“This is horrible,” Cornelia gasped in shock, followed by silence as she tried to process the most recent set of revelations. I didn’t begrudge her for it, considering the number of shocks she had experienced in the last couple of hours. I stopped speaking as well, not wanting to shock her again before she could process the current information. </p><p>Pity, because I was thinking of arranging a meeting between her and Helga, curious how they would react to each other with their loaded past. </p><p>As we traveled back to school, I finally turned my attention back to the latest development. Why there was a second earth gem in the earth tortoise. Earlier, I had assumed that the necromancers were using the earth gem to turn a lucky discovery of a growing horde into a weapon, but the presence of a second gem turned that assumption sideways, especially with the weird chaotic spell I had felt on it. It didn’t last for long once the creature was dead, but what I could feel at that fleeting moment was enough to unsettle me. </p><p>“Surely not,” I murmured to myself, trying to ignore the most obvious possibility, but failing spectacularly in the process. I hoped that my assumption was too wild, as the necromancers were dangerous enough without the ability to artificially triggering monster hordes. Their hordes of undead were bad enough, limited only by the relatively time-consuming and complicated process of raising dead. </p><p>However, while it was bleak, it wasn’t suicidally bleak. After all, a natural magical gem was a rare treasure. A very rare one, to the point that even many mid-sized noble families didn’t have one despite their desperate search. It meant that it was expensive and rare enough that they needed to be very careful while employing, and each failure cost them a lot, while enriching the defenders in the process. </p><p>So, as one of those lucky defenders, I was suddenly filthy rich. By selling these two gems, I could easily establish a new noble family if I felt so inclined —including the bribes required to get the noble title—,  not that I wanted to do so. Not when I could use them to create a very beautiful weapon instead. </p><p>I dispelled the elemental only after moving more than a hundred miles, more than enough to avoid any kind of detection as long as I avoided flashy spells, which meant fire magic was out, not that it was a big issue. </p><p>“Are we going to rest for a bit before we return?” Cornelia asked. </p><p>“Why would we return?” I asked even as I draw Aviada’s sword. I could see a golden lion prowling in a nearby bush, this time an old male, making it much easier to handle than the pride of lionesses I had battled before. “We still have quite a bit of time to </p><p>“But the monster horde, followed by conjuring that elemental mount?” Cornelia stammered in shock. “Aren’t you exhausted?”</p><p>“I have to admit, I’m a bit low on mana,” I admitted even as I charged toward the lion, turning the tables enough that I was able to get a slash before it could react, which turned an already unfair fight into a total rout. A few seconds later, the golden lion lay dead, making me richer in material, and making Cornelia richer by around a hundred and fifty experience points. “That’s why I’m killing them with my sword, like a brainless warrior,” I quipped with a smirk. </p><p>“You’re unbelievable,” she murmured in fascination as I quickly butchered the monster magically, extracting the most precious materials and leaving the rest to rot. </p><p>“Shall we,” I said as I presented my arm in a move that would be perfect in a formal ball, but comically exaggerated in the middle of nowhere, earning a chuckle, though it still felt a bit hysterical. She was still trying to find her balance. We walked toward the next target, and at that point, I once again charged forward, taking down a small pack of twisted wolves with a few calculated slashes. I even activated the lure effect of the sword, making hunting much easier, as monsters started to come to us rather than the reverse.  </p><p>I felt a desire to own a proper weapon as I sliced through the charging monsters, even as I started to suspect that it wouldn’t rival Aviada’s sword, even with the addition of the earth gem. It might be the expanded perception given by Master Swordsmanship, but I started to feel the hint of untapped potential, one that rejected my call even as I tried to reach it by mana senses. The more I used it, the more I was getting convinced that it was something more than just a simple long-lasting magical sword with some nifty magical tricks like lure effect.</p><p>However, even if my presumption was correct, I doubted that Aviada was capable of tapping into that power, or even if she was aware of it in the first place. Other families were certainly unaware of it, that was for certain, as otherwise, they would have never let Aviada’s collapsing family keep it in hand. Yes, her ex-fiancee tried to take the sword, but it was equally about his pride as the sword itself. I could feel that whatever the mystery lay in the heart of the sword, the real big hitters were unaware of it. </p><p>I needed to question Aviada about the history of the sword. </p><p>Once the current crisis was resolved, of course. Whatever the mystery that lay in the sword, it was clearly not as important as the ever-growing necromancer threat. </p><p>I turned my attention back to the hunt, and decided to change my methodology a bit. And since my mana had recovered during my hunt, I decided to change my methodology a bit. Handling them in the melee was fun, but not as fun as the tricks I could pull with Cornelia next to me, wearing nothing but a robe, primed to finally complete the companion process. </p><p>Once again, I decided to impress. I activated the lure ability of the sword in its full potential, despite knowing that it would create a dangerous wave of creatures. After handling a horde single-handedly, it was simply not scary. I still established three layers of runes around me to replicate the earlier inferno trick just in case it pulls a larger group than I had first assumed, but I didn’t expect to do so. </p><p>It was good, because I wanted to pay Cornelia the attention she deserved. “Now, why don’t you show me just how much you have improved after gaining all those levels and achievements?” I asked her huskily, making her shiver. Before she could answer, I pulled her robe off her body once more, revealing delicious naked skin to shine under the bright moonlight. </p><p>Her melodic gasp reached into my ear even as I wrapped my arms around her waist, pressing my shaft against her entrance. “R-right now?” she stammered. </p><p>“No time like the present,” I whispered into her ear even as I slapped her ass, once again leaving a delicious handprint, my other hand freeing my shaft, which was feeling claustrophobic in the confines of my pants. “Show me just how much you have improved. There’s even a reward if you can impress me. But let too many to reach the defensive line, and you’ll get a punishment instead,” I added, unable to keep myself from chuckling, curious whether she would enjoy the reward or the punishment more. </p><p>From what I had seen, until now, I had a feeling that it was the latter. </p><p>Before she could say anything, the first monster reached the boundary. A lone dire bear, charging fearlessly toward us, caught under the effect of the lure. While Cornelia tried to conjure a flame spear, however, I slid inside her, which caused her to botch the spell. She wasn’t an amateur, so rather than dispelling the spell, she had managed to dump more mana into it and turn it into an area-effect fireball, burning the bear into cinders, even as she clamped around my shaft. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 83%]</p><p>“Not bad, but a bit wasteful,” I said to her. “You could have easily killed it by spending a tenth of your mana, easily.” </p><p>“Hey, not fair! You distracted-” she tried to complain, only to receive a spank to silence her. </p><p>“Yes, I did, but even your initial flame spear was excessive,” I said. “Watch carefully.” With that, I slowly conjured a much more compact fire arrow slowly, allowing her to watch the process. It was one of the tricks I had discovered during my studies with Helga. It was effectively three different fire spells tightly wrapped around each other, giving it a unique penetration ability. I used the spell on another creature, taking it down in one move. </p><p>[-11 Mana]</p><p>“That’s too hard for me,” she gasped, only to receive another spank to her ass. </p><p>“It’s well within your capabilities,” I countered after the small punishment, even as started pumping her rhythmically. “Watch carefully,” I ordered as I built the spell again, this time much more slowly, giving her ample time to observe the trick, even as I continued to pump her mercilessly, forcing her to take my presence deeper and deeper. Her moans rose accordingly, adding to the effect of the lure we had created. </p><p>“How about this?” she asked as she created a poor copy of the spell, its structure already unraveling. </p><p>“Try aiming to that rock,” I said, pointing at a human-sized stone that was about fifty feet away. Cornelia followed by order, but the spell dispersed after flying ten feet. I grabbed her beautiful red hair, and forced her to turn to me. “Do you see where it went wrong,” I gasped. </p><p>“The structure is-” she started, only to explode into a moan as I left a bite mark on her neck. “The structure needs to be more stable.”</p><p>“Exactly,” I said as I slammed my full length inside her, forcing her to moan explosively. “Try again.” </p><p>She followed my directions for the next several minutes, while I continued reinforcing her soul space by dumping my mana. Whenever a creature appeared, she shifted back to her preferred spells like flame spears and fireballs, which didn’t help her mana pool. She tried to be more conservative in terms of spending, but that resulted in more and more creatures slipping through her defenses. </p><p>“Another miss,” I said as I spanked her ass once more, but this time, my touch was accompanied by a convenient biomancy spell, cleaning and lubricating her bowels, preparing her other hole for my invasion. I plopped a finger, making her moan, even as I continued to slam into her tightness. “You need to be more accurate on assessing the threat level,” I said even as the creature was eviscerated by my earthen fist. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 87%]</p><p>“Sorry,” she gasped, starting to slur under the rush of pleasure. “But I’m almost out of mana.”</p><p>“Not a problem, sweetheart,” I said even as I used our closeness to inject a generous portion of mana inside her, even as I increased the number of fingers from one to three in her puckered hole. Refilling her mana was almost trivial at this point, as her full capacity was about a third of mine despite the relatively small level difference, making it very easy for me to top her up completely.</p><p>[-1116 Mana]</p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 89%]</p><p>[Achievement: Amorous Assist. Help your paramour to stand against unbeatable odds through indirect and unconventional means. +2 Intelligence, +500 Experience]</p><p>“Is there anything you can’t do?” Cornelia gasped in shock, even as her spells picked up speed. However, as her spells increased, so did the monstrous attention targeting us. Combined with the effect of the lure, it wasn’t shocking for the stronger monsters to appear. At this point, almost half of the attackers were above class ten, making it very difficult for Cornelia to defeat them before they reached the defensive line, forcing me to get involved. </p><p>“You’re slipping,” I warned her, after we destroyed yet another wave of monsters, while I continued to pump her. She tried to answer, but it was a difficult task to achieve with her continuous moaning. </p><p>Instead of giving a proper answer, she started crying in joy. “Yes, yes, oh YES!” she cried, starting to shudder, but to her credit, she didn’t stop her task of attacking the monsters, even when they had attacked us from multiple directions. She defended herself generously, though she required another mana injection to sustain herself.</p><p>[-983 Mana]</p><p>Then, I noticed something interesting in her soul space. A weird sensation flickered around the edges, then, for lack of a better term, the walls folded around itself by creating an independent cell, before moving to the center, and mixing into the center of power. “Another achievement,” she gasped in glee. “This time, endurance and perception, two points each.” </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 92%]</p><p>“I know sweetheart,” I said, subtly taking responsibility for it —not that I felt guilty about it, as I clearly enabled it— even though I was pretty sure I finally watched the maturation of natural achievement. </p><p>I examined her soul space carefully even as she attacked the monster horde with a renewed enthusiasm, trying to understand the difference between the types of achievements. Surprisingly, I have realized that getting an achievement actually weakened the soul space, not enough to prevent it from a full level, but a few of them might actually reduce the level capacity by one. Yet another interesting detail I had failed to find in the library, and considering its importance, I wasn’t going to write it off as me missing it. It was either unknown, or it was another secret hidden from the general public. </p><p>It made me curious, but not as much as the rapidly growing progress bar of the companion system. Considering the rewards I had received during the earlier phases, I couldn’t help but feel enthusiastic about finally unwrapping that particular box of present to completion… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 24    Experience: 296900 / 300000 </p><p>Strength: 28    Charisma: 41</p><p>Precision: 24    Perception: 27</p><p>Agility: 25     Manipulation: 30</p><p>Speed: 23       Intelligence: 34</p><p>Endurance: 22      Wisdom: 33</p><p>HP: 2899 / 2928\tMana: 2834 / 3960        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Expert Arcana [75/75]        </p><p>Expert Subterfuge [75/75]         </p><p>Basic Speech [25/25]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p>",

    "content": "<p>“Good evening, Mr. Steel,” said the Butcher of Boston with a kind tone, like he was just an old fisherman starting a simple conversation. “Would you like to have a seat?” I froze for a second, examining his style. The way he dressed was just as lax as his tone, just wearing a pair of slacks and a crumpled shirt, uncaring of how he looked. That, even more than his past reputation, told me that I was facing someone that was very important. Not everyone could afford to dress shabbily on the top floor of the Sapphire Palace, and the lack of bodyguards or cameras drove the point even deeper —except a waiter that was hiding on the corner, too far away to react in case of an emergency.  </p><p>No, the room belonged to him, which meant he was very high in the organization. No wonder he felt confident posturing. </p><p>The only question was, why he summoned me. I would have guessed that he had discovered my identity, but he referred me with my alias, so it didn’t look like the case. Or at least, I hoped that to be the case. I wouldn’t be too surprised to learn that he would be playing with me, followed by a short disappointment punctuated by a bullet to the back of my head. </p><p>Luckily, the years I had spent as a high-profile thief had trained me well to hide my shock. “Good evening to you, sir,” I answered after an appropriate amount of stagger, and took a seat. After all, it would be suspicious for my alias to react to adapt instantly. </p><p>The butcher said nothing for a moment, just gestured, and the waiter slid closer silently as top-class butlers reputed to, but I had a feeling that his skills weren’t developed in stuffy castles and colorful galas. He expertly filled two wine glasses from the old bottle, and a heavenly smell reached my nose. “Please,” the butcher said as he grabbed his own glass while the waiter disappeared back into the shadows. </p><p>I couldn’t help but widen as I took a sip, a heavenly aroma assaulting my tongue. I wasn’t an amateur when it came to wine —it was one of the most useful skills as I tried to penetrate the upper class in my past thievery career, not to mention the additional training I had received after I had been recruited as an agent. But I had never tasted such a complex and aromatic wine in my life. I didn’t speak until I finished the glass, focusing on enjoying the wine. </p><p>My fears were put to rest. If I were to be executed, he wouldn’t waste such precious wine on me. </p><p>“I hope the wine was to your satisfaction,” the butcher said after we finished the first glass, leaning back relaxedly, which did little to the threat he posed. He might be old, but that was not a reason to underestimate him. In his line of work, getting old was not an easy task to achieve. </p><p>“Incredible,” I admitted easily. “Though I’m having a bit of trouble recognizing the vintage.” </p><p>“Recognizing it would have been more surprising,” he admitted with a chuckle. “It’s a bottle gifted by a Russian acquaintance, from a batch his father looted from the palace of the Tzar during the revolution.” </p><p>I couldn’t help but react in surprise. Even without the historic importance of such a wine, it was at least a century old, and among such wine, it doubtlessly had a special place. Otherwise, it was impossible to earn its place in the cellars of Czar Nicholas. “And if I’m not being too forward, why I’m being subject to such honor, especially by such an impressive host as Mr. O'Reilly?” I countered, using his real name. </p><p>He chuckled, but a light of interest shone in his eye. “You recognize me, good. I like it, no dawdling around and posturing. But it’s a bit surprising that a keyboard boy like you knows an old man like me.” </p><p>I shrugged. “I had a colorful youth before taking the software route, and it was not always entirely on the bright side of the justice,” I admitted, revealing some information willingly. It was clear that with the wine and the Silver VIP status, I was on his radar. Under such a direct assessment, I couldn’t maintain my skills indefinitely, so willingly revealing my potential would work better. </p><p>“Interesting,” the butcher answered, his interest peeking forward. “So, I’m guessing the chaos that you created was not entirely accidental?” </p><p>I didn’t feel the need to ask what he was talking about. With the timing, it was obvious that he was talking about my shocking engagement with Sabrina. I decided that honesty was the best way to go on that, as my situation was complicated enough. “Unfortunately, it’s still accidental, as I have limited contacts in Latin America, and didn’t recognize her or other people at the table,” I admitted. “I was just paying her back for a favor for helping me win big on poker. I didn’t learn exactly which family she belonged before it was too late.” </p><p>O’Reilly watched me carefully, to assess whether I was lying, only to explode in laughter a moment later. “Oh, you’re actually telling the truth. That’s grand!” he hollered, shaking with laughter for almost a minute. “You’re telling me that you have engaged with the granddaughter of the Old Ghost by accident.” </p><p>I stiffened once more. “The Old Ghost?” I whispered, unable to help myself. </p><p>“You didn’t know that as well?” he added, laughing even harder. “Oh, that’s grand.” </p><p>As much as I didn’t enjoy being the butt of the joke, I could understand his amusement. The Old Ghost was another legend in the business, though unlike O’Reilly, his death was confirmed. He had died in his seventies, but not without creating one last legend and taking two established families down with him. “And may I ask, how my fiancee is related to him.” </p><p>“Maternal grandfather,” the butcher answered, his laughter finally subsiding. “Actually, that’s why I called you here, to test your mettle. Let’s start,” he added, and gestured to the waiter once more, and he came and pulled the table away, while three men, each dressed in impeccable suits, walked inside. It was easy to recognize that they were trained well, but not too well. “Show me what you got,” he said. </p><p>I nodded once even as I grabbed a napkin, and then jumped up to my feet. With a kick, I sent the chair I was sitting on the one on the left, and threw the napkin at the one on the right. One against three was not the best odds without any weapon, especially when I had to walk in a tightrope, not revealing some of the more unique tricks I had learned in the Agency. </p><p>Luckily, even when I was a street rat, I was trained nicely. Unlike what most people thought, quite a few of the homeless people were in destitute not because of monetary issues but mental problems and substance abuse, especially the veterans. Therefore, a resourceful street rat could receive the training only the special forces could receive in exchange for cheap alcohol and even cheaper drugs. </p><p>Even better, after living in the streets, those veterans had a wealth of experience in dirty fighting, one I had no problems employing. At first, I had charged toward the one in the middle, only to take a sudden turn and sweep the one on the right, still reeling from the distraction from the napkin. He fell on the ground, and a kick on the diaphragm put him out of commission for a while. It didn’t matter how experienced a fighter, a kick to the correct location locked their breathing. And even better, it was nonlethal —though it might crack a few ribs— so I wouldn’t earn the displeasure of my host by killing one of his fighters. </p><p>Then, it was one against two. The one on the left tried to use the same trick by pushing the chair toward me and charging forward together with his friend, but I stepped on the chair instead, using it to jump, pushing him back with a kick on the shoulder, then rolling to the side to make sure he was in between me and the other attacker before launching a punch combo. </p><p>I was preparing for another fancy trick when O’Reilly spoke. “Enough.” Just like that, three bodyguards stopped, looking dejected. “I’m a bit disappointed,” the Butcher said as he looked at his man. “Never underestimate an opponent.” It was a sign of their discipline that they stood straight —except the one that I kicked in the ribs, who was supported by his friends— and said nothing before they disappeared through the same door they entered. </p><p>He looked at me with a renewed interest. “Not bad. It seems that my research didn’t reveal everything,” he said. “I wasn’t expecting special forces training, but something is weird?” he murmured as he gazed at me, then his eyes brightened. “No wonder your moves are weird. You were quite young when you started training. Eight, nine?”  </p><p>“Eleven, but I was small for my age,” I corrected. “For an enterprising street-rat that can rob an alcohol store regularly, finding trainers is not a difficult task,” I added, revealing a nugget from my past. I didn’t want to, but he was clearly researching me, and giving him some real nugget about my childhood might distract me from the last couple of years of my life. As long my involvement with the Agency was not revealed, it wasn’t the worst-case scenario. </p><p>“Good, I like a self-make man,” O’Reilly commented with a chuckle. “And I’m sure the Old Ghost would have loved that as well, if he didn’t kill you in a training accident,” he chuckled. As we talked, the waiter came and rearranged the room and refreshed our wine glasses, alongside with an exquisite cheese platter. He took a long sip, before speaking once more. “Initially, I was hoping for to you be the distraction while I made my move, but I like what I see. You’re good, maybe good enough to actually survive.” </p><p>“I’m guessing there’s something more to Sabrina’s marriage issue?” I asked. </p><p>“You’re not wrong,” he told, his expression serious. “What I’m going to tell you is going to stay secret, even from Sabrina,” he stated, not bothering to tell what would happen if I ignored it, and I didn’t bother to ask. With his nickname, I didn’t need to. “You think that Sabrina is the daughter of the current leader of the Blue Guard, but that’s wrong. She’s actually his niece, and both her father and mother disappeared when she was just a baby, suspected death, but despite our search, we weren’t able to confirm one way or another.” </p><p>“Interesting,” I murmured. The Blue Guard was strong, and the Organization was even stronger. If the Butcher, who was obviously an executive of the ruling council, was unable to identify it one way or another, it was clearly not a simple issue. Of course, Sabrina’s real status was even more surprising, though considering the insistence of the current leader Diego showed to make her marry in a way that would make her ineligible for ruling the family, it made a certain amount of sense in the hindsight.</p><p>“Yeah,” he approved. “However, since the Old Ghost was a good rival, I decided to pay attention to his granddaughter, to protect her. I didn’t like the fact that Diego was trying to auction her to a bunch of idiotic heirs, but I had my suspicions, so I didn’t get involved. It proved the correct decision, because one of my spies had discovered that actually, her hand was promised to a mysterious third party, but it was top secret. To my knowledge, apart from Diego and a few key executives, only the oldest son is unaware of the situation.” </p><p>“So that’s why you sent a silver card to me and called me to a private meeting despite not knowing much about me,” I said calmly as everything clicked. “You want them to think I’m your man, and you want them to think that you’re trying to prevent Sabrina from being married to one of those idiots, while on the background, you search for the mystery fiancee on the background.” </p><p>“Smart boy,” he said, though I had a feeling that he was talking about my calm acceptance of the situation rather than understanding his simplistic —but effective— strategy. “I don’t care much about the relationship between you and Sabrina, as she’s a big girl, and I don’t know her personally. I’m only involved due to respect for an old rival, protecting her from an impossible challenge. The rest is up to her. She either handles the pressure and proves herself deserving of the reputation of her old man, or she shatters.” </p><p>“Noted,” I said with an appreciative nod, not voicing my suspicions. The story he put together was certainly believable, fitting both his rumored personality and the situation, but I couldn’t help but feel like there was something much bigger going underneath, but I let it slide, as even the surface of the situation was complicated enough. Also, O’Reilly might be just using me as a distraction, but the silver VIP status actually increased the chances of completing the mission successfully. </p><p>Of course, fate proved to be a fickle mistress, because just as I was leaving the private room, the main elevator parted open, and a figure I recognized stepped into the restaurant. Of course, he was different than his pictures, wearing his hair shorter, dyed black rather than its original grayish hue. Similarly, he hid his icy blue eyes behind a pair of thick-framed glasses, and used professional-grade makeup to cover the scar on his chin. However, in the world of secret agents, these changes were nothing. Clearly, he was feeling confident enough to walk around with a poor disguise. </p><p>I had just found Agent Brown, and he looked very healthy… </p><p>Something was wrong. Very, very, wrong… </p>",

    "content": "<p>As Aria cummed under the assault of my fingers, I paused the music as well, letting the silence rule the room, broken only by Aria’s desperate breathing. Emma stilled once more, unable to pull her gaze away from the sexy blonde on my lap. I didn’t blame her, as with her eyes fluttering under the pleasure, her body covered with the marks of my rough treatment, still unable to speak thanks to her panties stuffed in her mouth, Aria made an impressive sight. </p><p>I waved my hand, and Aria hovered toward the chair, making Emma flinch. Making someone float was not a difficult spell if the target didn’t resist, but it drove my freedom even deeper. After putting Aria on the chair —and making sure she wouldn’t fall off in her daze— I turned my attention back to Emma. Another spell later, the music filled my cell once more, but this time, it was a softer, more sensual melody. </p><p>Smart enough to understand the implied order, Emma started swaying under the rhythm of the music once more, but one of her arms stayed locked around her corset, preventing it from falling down. She danced for a minute, and I enjoyed the sight, as much as she enjoyed my naked erection —as much as she tried to hide it. After a few minutes, she realized that I had no intention of breaching the topic as long as she danced, and spoke. “You were talking about possible avenues of cooperation.” </p><p>“Right,” I said, making a show of being shocked. “Sorry about that, but I was distracted,” I added, letting my gaze jump between Aria’s half-naked figure and her sexy dancing body. “Can you blame me?” </p><p>“Please stay focused on the topic,” Emma reminded sharply, ignoring the temptation to lash out. She even stopped dancing to glare at me. </p><p>I chuckled. “Sorry about that,” I said. “While revealing the location of Eternal Core is impossible, I can reveal you guys several important secrets of the Dark Faction, such as defensive weaknesses of the key fortresses, their magical secrets, or even spies the Empire who are actually double-agents that’s feeding false information.” </p><p>“We don’t have spies,” Aria countered immediately from the side, finally breaking through her daze, and earning an incredulous glare from Emma, and a chuckle from me. Aria looked shocked, so shocked that she had forgotten to cover her breasts —or maybe she decided not to bother, but I was willing to believe it was the former. “Do we?” she added in a trembling tone. </p><p>“It’s an interesting offer, if a bit thin,” Emma suggested, trying to sound uninterested, but it was impossible for her to hide the shine in her eyes. What I had outlined was very valuable intelligence, and gaining that would have given Emma a lot of credit to establish herself in palace politics. “Still, not a bad start. What do you have in mind in return?” </p><p>I would have liked to say I was impressed with her poker face, but that would be a lie. Still, I let her think that she succeeded. “You can start by finally dropping that corset.” </p><p>“In exchange for what?” Emma countered, showing that her greed was stronger than her modesty. Though, to be fair, she was smart enough to realize that she couldn’t extract herself from the situation just by dancing in her underwear, not after she watched Aria’s rough treatment, which included everything but penetration. </p><p>“In exchange for me not escaping. Did you think that poor Aria was going to be the only one that’s going to suffer for your mistake,” I said, which made her freeze once more. “Still, I might decide to reveal the name of a low-level double-agent if you can impress with your initiative,” I added. </p><p>Emma stood still, an expression of concentration on her face as she thought about my offer. Meanwhile, I spared a glance to Aria, who was watching us with shock, partially due to the way my discussion with Emma was going, and partially due to the realization of what her passive acceptance had led to. I met with her gaze and send her a salacious smirk, and she replied with a blush. A second later, her arms jumped to her chest, trying to cover her half-naked state. She tried to follow up by reaching for her dress, but I shook my head, vetoing the idea. </p><p>She followed my command, and stayed on her chair, using her arms to cover her deliciously perky chest. </p><p>“I agree,” Emma said decisively, getting my attention, though I was more interested in the way her corset finally hitting the floor, revealing her breasts, which was beautiful, though not enough to rival Aria’s. Still, the rest of her sexy and toned body went a long way to compensate for an earlier loss, especially her perfectly toned stomach. </p><p>“Then, impress me, red,” I commented as I parted my legs, revealing my throbbing shaft fully. Her statement was confident, but the same confidence wasn’t reflected in her expression, which seemed hesitant. I doubted that without the courage from her foray into my memory, she could even accept the deal I suggested, so it was a win. “Don’t forget that only by really impressing me you can earn the name of the slimy bastard that’s feeding your side dangerously-falsified information.” </p><p>Emma didn’t appreciate my reminder, but that didn’t prevent her from closing in with a sexy sway, following the sensual rhythm of the music, under my entertained and Aria’s shocked gaze. </p><p>I had assumed that my opinion of Lancelot couldn’t get any lower, but watching her desperate strut, he managed to achieve the impossible. After all, he somehow managed to leave such exquisite examples of sexiness unfulfilled despite months of campaigning. Luckily, he had a good friend like me to help cover his mistakes! </p><p>Emma closed in slowly, her body swaying as she danced with each step, while Aria watched her in shock, and if I was seeing correctly, a flickering hint of jealousy. How interesting, I noted, as I kept my attention on Emma, well-aware that it would enhance Aria’s envy further. It was inevitable after I spent all the time flaming it further. </p><p>“Speak,” Emma whispered as she stood in front of me, and started delivering a delicious dance. Her body was like a gentle wave, her beautiful ass rocking with every move. I wished there was a pole that she could lean on to deliver some more impressive moves, but was infeasible, at least for the moment. Instead, she crouched down, her knees on the cold stone floor of my cell, her tits dangling sexily as she slithered forward, closing in the distance between us. She raised her body only when she stood directly in front of me, but she was still on her knees. An impressive show of dancing, I noted, enough to fuel Aria’s flickers of jealousy into a raging flame, giving a rare light to her blue eyes. </p><p>Suddenly, I was struck with a desire to include Aria in a different way than a passive observer. Luckily, I had the perfect way to do so. Just as Emma was about to stand up, I grabbed her wrist and pulled her close. Then, I lay her on my knees, just like a naughty schoolgirl who earned a punishment. “What the hell-” she started, only to be silenced by a spank to her barely-covered ass. </p><p>“Before we properly start, there’s still your punishment to be addressed,” I reminded her even as I spanked her ass again. </p><p>“Punishment for what!” Emma gasped. </p><p>“For your thoughtless action of freeing me and leaving poor Aria to clean your mistake, of course,” I explained, accompanied by yet another spank. </p><p>“Why are you punishing me for that,” Emma asked in shock, which, technically, was correct. After all, while I didn’t owe her for freeing me, I did owe her for giving me such an excuse to reveal my status. </p><p>“You’re right, I shouldn’t punish you for that,” I answered, and she relaxed, but it was short-lived, because I waved my hand to conjure a small paddle from the thin air. Emma stiffened as she felt the strong flare of magic. Conjuration was not a simple discipline, and I doubted that many mages could afford to use it frivolously. “Aria should be the one that’s punishing you,” I said even as I threw it to Aria. </p><p>“What!” came the double exclamation. </p><p>Emma stayed on my lap, too shocked to move, while Aria reached to grab the paddle, leaving her tits naked in the process, only to fumble badly. “Sorry,” Aria gasped as the paddle hit on the stone floor with a crisp sound, and she leaned to get it. “Do you really want me to…” Aria continued, blushing badly, but despite avoiding my gaze, I could see the excitement in her eyes. </p><p>“That’s nonsense,” Emma shouted while I nodded to Aria, struggling to stand up from my lap, only to fail under my strong grasp. She wasn’t putting her full strength in the first place, and under my iron grip, she was quickly dissuaded from her decision. </p><p>“Really,” I said even as I gestured for Aria to move closer. “Is it more ridiculous than you risking the capital itself in your foolish desire to look for a dirty release, only to leave my chains unlocked carelessly, leaving the poor princess to sacrifice so much just to keep the big bad Dark Lord sated?” I said, making eye contact with Aria in the process. Despite my words, I made sure to hit Aria with my most seductive smile, making her skip a step and stumble, blushing furiously. Her innocence was addictive. </p><p>“It’s not my fault that the blonde bimbo decided to whore herself-” Emma started complaining. I understood where she was coming from. She was clearly feeling that she was losing control, so, she lashed out to her only viable target, thinking that she was safe from retaliation. Not a bad assumption considering Aria’s record when it came to defending herself. Unfortunately, she made one big mistake. </p><p>Aria wasn’t defending herself, but following my commands. And under the circumstances, my words were heavier than hers. </p><p>All it took was a nod from me to Aria to cross the remaining distance and hit Emma’s ass, protected by only her flimsy lacy panties. “Good attempt, but try to hit harder,” I said to Aria. “It was supposed to do more than just tickling.” </p><p>Aria just nodded while Emma spoke. “Wait a minute-” she tried to say, only to be interrupted by another hit from Aria’s paddle, this time hard enough to force a cry, leaving a pink mark behind. </p><p>“Not bad,” I said even as I caressed the mark Aria’s assault left, amused by the sudden hint of jealously awakened in Aria’s eyes whenever I touched Emma tenderly. An emotion I had no problems using to goad her further. “Again,” I reminded her, and the paddle exploded on Emma’s skin once more. </p><p>“Hey, that’s-” Emma tried to say, only to be interrupted by another slam, this time without my explicit order. I examined Aria’s face, her enjoyment clear, mixed with surprise. She was finally retaliating in some manner in her sheltered life, and learning the joys of standing up for herself, no matter how much it shocked herself. </p><p>“You need to take your punishment obediently to earn the identity of your double-agent,” I said to her, even as I loosened my grip on her body. “So, stand up and walk away if you want, but this is the deal.” </p><p>Suddenly facing an ultimatum, Emma fell silent, proving that she was a poor negotiator. A more experienced one would have been aware of the fact that I needed extended cooperation, and was not in a position to enforce such an ultimatum if she had pushed back. At worst, she could have argued that it was an extension of the initial deal, and requested additional benefits. </p><p>She twisted her neck to meet my gaze, and to my surprise, I felt a surface probe trying to analyze my mood, yet another thing proving her utter lack of experience. It would have been trivial to destroy her mind using the connection she provided, but she leisurely assessed my surface thoughts nonetheless —or more accurately, the fake determination I showed to her in lieu of my true amusement. </p><p>It wasn’t only tactics of negotiation that she needed a detailed lesson, but that wasn’t as important as the nod she gave to me, accepting my demand. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said even as I ripped her panties with a pull and stuffed them into her mouth, using the same method I had employed against Aria earlier. Emma stiffened in anger, but she didn’t make any attempt to escape the situation. I turned to Aria. “Continue,” I ordered, and she did so immediately, hitting harder than I expected. </p><p>“She deserves it,” Aria defended herself when I hit her with a mocking grin. I shrugged, not bothering to say anything, too amused by the way Aria finally touched her angry side, not dark, of course, but slightly gray, which was a vast improvement considering her usual personality. Aria slammed the paddle to her ass once more. </p><p>“Try to alternate cheeks,” I said, guiding Aria even as Emma’s ass started to glow under her treatment. I had ulterior motives for that, of course. Immediately after Aria spanked her ass, I started caressing Emma’s ass, with a hint of soothing magic wrapped around my fingers. The contrast it provided with the stinging sensation of Aria’s assisted slaps was amazing, evidenced by the sudden increase in Emma’s wetness. </p><p>She was aroused before as well, but it was just gentle dampness. Now, she was literally gushing, hints of arousal trailing down her thighs. I decided to take pity on her. “Poor girl,” I said as I caressed, but unlike the previous times, my target wasn’t her tight ass, but her wet lips, quivering in anticipation. She let out a surprised cry, one that her panties proved inadequate to properly suppress. </p><p>I ignored her reaction and started massaging her most sensitive spot, dancing around her clit, again and again, to build up anticipation, and slipping into her entrance to release a part of the said tension, so much that she started wiggling on my lap, trying to moan in protest. </p><p>However, the real surprise came from Aria. Her spanking suddenly picked up speed, the paddle exploding on Emma’s skin hard enough to echo in the room. I met Aria’s beautiful blue eyes with a questioning look, only to earn a shy hesitant look. “Are you jealous,” I said, unable to keep myself from chuckling. </p><p>“What! No!” she answered, surprisingly loud, but equally unconvincing. </p><p>“Really,” I said even as I let my gaze caress her body. Since she was naked other than her dress, which was bunched around her waist, so watching her blush was spectacular. It started from her neck, then started spreading in both directions. Her face turned into a delicious shade of red, and a moment later, her bountiful breasts followed them, looking deliciously red. She nodded, but it was a resigned nod, aware just how unconvincing it was. </p><p>“Don’t worry, sweetie, I have another hand,” I reminded her even as I reached and touched her dress, and pulled it hard, ripping it off her body, leaving her naked, discounting her shoes. She gasped in shock, only to be followed by a moan of pleasure when my fingers found her entrance, fingering her wetness once more. Her eyes widened at my action, no doubt thinking it excessively, which was rather ridiculous. Considering everything I had already done, this one wasn’t a lot. “Continue,” I said, reminding her of the task at hand. </p><p>Just like that, Aria continued paddling Emma’s bottom while I fingered both beauties at the same time, pushing them steadily toward orgasm. Even that part gave me a bit of a surprise. I was expecting Emma to climax first, considering I had been working on her for a while, but Aria exploded surprisingly quick, proving that she had been enjoying her new task a bit more than it was respectable. She collapsed on the chair, gasping for breath. </p><p> Though, to be fair, Emma was not too far behind, trembling like she was experiencing a spectacular earthquake. Unlike Aria, however, Emma stood up immediately despite her trembling legs, and pulled her panties out of her mouth, looking at me with a furious glare. “I have held my end of the deal, now it’s your turn,” she said. As she spoke, a sudden warm wind started flowing in the room, suggesting that she was angry enough to lose control of her elemental capabilities. </p><p>“Sure,” I said, deciding not to push her more today. Unlike Aria, Emma had a tendency to react explosively without thinking, and I could feel that I was already bordering a disaster. “And since you have been such a good sport, I’m going to give you the reveal the identity of a double-agent, and as a bonus, I’ll also reveal a spy in the capital.” After all, it was never a bad idea to establish more rewards for exemplar performance. </p><p>I quickly gave a rundown of two unimportant spies that belonged to some minor Dark Factions. Even without my loyal soldiers, I wasn’t afraid of the major factions, but I didn’t want to destroy the political landscape before I could get a better understanding of the new balance. Meanwhile, Emma dressed. Aria tried to dress as well, but unlike Emma, it didn’t go as smoothly since I had ruined her dress. </p><p>As I spoke, my mind was already focused on the next stage of my plan. After her display, holding Emma back was not an option. But should I hold Aria back for a private session, or let her go as well? </p>",

    "content": "<p>Looking at the impressive ruins made of marble —enchanted marble, even— I couldn’t help but feel a bit afraid. After all, Mount Pyrenaean was the most dangerous location I had ever visited, with a chaotic magical flow so thick that it required one to be a Sorcerer just to move along safely. Seeing a complete town, abandoned centuries ago, did little to calm me down. </p><p>“Do you know anything substantial about the mountain,” I asked Astrid as we stood on the edge of the town. “For example, was it always a dangerous place?” </p><p>“It was supposed to be always like that, a dangerous holy ground occupied by the spirits,” Astrid answered as she looked at the town, her frown matching mine. “But the existence of a Roman town doesn’t exactly work well with it.” </p><p>“It’s clearly abandoned for at least a few centuries,” I commented as I examined the broken marbles, oozing magic. They had degraded noticeably, and for that to happen in such a clearly magical area, it required a lot of time. </p><p>“Then there’s not much a difference of time between its construction and abandonment,” Lillian cut in. </p><p>“Do you have a basis for saying that?” I asked, curious. </p><p>She pointed at the nearest broken pillar. “The style of architecture,” she pointed. “Also, every single pillar we could see is stamped by the mark of the same Patrician family, of House Julia.” </p><p>“How does it limit the construction of the city?” Astrid cut in. “Was that a new family or something?” </p><p>“On the contrary,” Lillian answered with a small frown. “It was one of the ancient Patriarch families of Rome, present since its first founding.” </p><p>Astrid still looked confused, so she continued the explanation. “Because there are only a few times Julia family was strong enough to build such a city, with one exception, those times happened when the Roman Republic was yet to expand into Gallic land.” </p><p>“And that exception is Gaius Julius Caesar,” I cut in, which was a name that widened Astrid’s name. Justified, considering it belonged to the person that was singlehandedly responsible for the invasion and annexation of Gaul. </p><p>“Yes, the great Tyrant himself,” Lillian murmured in a mixture of fascination and distaste. I understood her point. To say that Caesar was a complicated figure was understating things. There was no single man that created more controversy in Roman history, changing everything through his sheer presence. On the one hand, he was the most decorated general of Roman history, even surpassing my own distant ancestor Scipio in achievement. After all, Scipio Africanus might have defeated Hannibal in his own homeland and the broke ancient Magical city of Carthage, but Caesar proved himself again and again during two decades of unbroken string of victories. </p><p>He annexed Gaul, broke the back of the Gallic tribes, and destroyed many magical enclaves that had been troubling Italy and Rome proper for centuries. He even defeated the great hero Vercingetorix, who had been empowered through the ritual sacrifice of a great many chiefs, merging the souls of many past heroes into his. It had been said that Vercingetorix shone like the sun, called lightning like a storm, and was strong enough to kill twenty men with each swing. Most importantly, he was charismatic enough to unite the tribes, and smart enough to lead them almost perfectly. </p><p>Still, even when he was hampered by his opponents in the Senate, Caesar proved his superiority by defeating him and forcing his surrender, removing the soul of resistance from Gaul in the process. No doubt even the mention of his name was enough to silence Astrid. For a priestess like her, his name was equivalent to a demon. </p><p>Of course, that was not just the case for Gallic and Germanic tribes. Even in Rome, he was a very controversial figure. After all, while he had a great many achievements —conqueror of Gaul, the first invader of Britanium, the savior of Asia-Minor, the bane of Pontus, the savior of Egypt— his most memorable victories were against other Roman generals. He defeated Pompei the Great in the plains of Greece, and destroyed another ancestor of mine, Quintus Metellus Scipio in Africa, and broke centuries-long tradition by capturing Rome. </p><p>In the end, he was assassinated in the holy ground of the Senate, claiming that he was trying to crown himself as a King, which was the greatest taboo of the Republic. </p><p>Of course, even that was not simple enough. Even after his assassination, he had enough supporters in public that the Senate was afraid of declaring him officially a traitor, even when his supporters had led another civil war —which they ultimately lost. </p><p>“Do you think that we just found the mysterious camp of Augustus Caesar?” Lillian asked enthusiastically. </p><p>“Possibly,” I said. </p><p>Caesar’s nephew —who he later adapted as a son— was almost as famous as Julius Caesar himself. After Caesar’s assassination, he managed to wrest control of Caesar’s political and military machine, and if it wasn’t for Mark Antony’s —Caesar’s infamous second-in-command— aggressive but inefficient political posturings, he might have actually won the second civil war and established himself as the first Emperor. </p><p>Instead, after losing a battle, he disappeared for two decades, only to appear from nowhere to wage another war, of which he showed a great magical and strategic talent. Pity that he proved lesser to his uncle, ultimately losing and dying on the battlefield. Still, his philosophy never died, and two centuries later, another follower of his philosophy, General Constantine, proved it through another civil war of which he cut half of the Republic and set the Roman Empire, creating a formidable enemy for the Republic from its own flesh and blood. </p><p>I knew a lot about the history of Julius Caesar as my grandfather forced me to learn. Normally, my grandfather had cared even less about history than I did, but the history of Julius Caesar also had quite a bit of importance for my family. It stemmed from the mystique around the surname Scipio. After the famous victories of Scipio Africanus, who had saved the Republic from collapsing against the formidable Hannibal, the Roman public was convinced that any army that was led by a Scipio was invincible in Africa. I didn’t know whether it was true, of course. It might be the case that house Scipio had a contract with a strong nature spirit that might surpass sorcerers, or they might have some unique spells that tapped into the unique geographical traits of the region. </p><p>Or it might be just a superstitious belief. </p><p>It stayed unknown, even for the current patriarchs of the Scipio family. Even my grandfather hadn’t known, or if he did, he didn’t deign to inform me about it. Regardless, Julius Caesar was a practical general, so rather than forcing a demoralized army to face a Scipio, he reached to Cornelius Scipio Salvito, who was a branch family member, and recruited him as a general. It was a brutal battle, but when Julius Caesar won, the remaining members of the Scipio family gathered behind Cornelius Scipio Salvito, and become strong supporters of Caesar. </p><p>Only to fall spectacularly when Julius Caesar was assassinated, followed by the death of Augustus two decades later. The remaining members of the family decided to abandon Rome and the reputation it afforded, and instead moved to Britanium to be a part of the colonization effort, slipping out of the spotlight, and closing the book on the glorious history of a Patrician family. </p><p>Fate was a fickle mistress. Centuries later, as a bastard scion of the Scipio family, I was looking at the ruins that were almost certainly left by a Caesar, the unwilling architects of our destruction. </p><p>As much as I wanted to enjoy the irony, I had more important things to focus on. “Might be,” I said. “This place is so hard to navigate that it’s not hard to imagine hiding a couple of thousand soldiers in such a way that it’s impossible to find, especially if they didn’t know to check the mountain in the first place. Augustus Caesar could have easily spent two decades behind the chaotic flows of the magic as he trained. And it explains the rumored magical talent of his core officer cadre if they had a way to train in such an incredible place. I had always ignored the rumor that every single Cohort of his had Centurion Sorcerer as an attempt to make the Republic look more impressive, but seeing this place, I’m more inclined to believe it.” </p><p>“Do you think the library of this place might be intact?” Lillian asked enthusiastically. </p><p>“I would expect that at least one of the Centurions had escaped the battle intact and returned here, but this place doesn’t look touched.” </p><p>“Maybe they were afraid of leading back the enemy here?” Astrid cut in and offered her own opinion. </p><p>“Or maybe, the protections were so strong that they were afraid of visiting without Augustus to raise the protections. I almost five centuries later, I can still feel the remnants of many overlapping wards protecting the place, and they are not the nice kind. I doubted that even a group of sorcerers would be able to safely dismantle them, not with such a chaotic mana storm ongoing.” </p><p>“At least it proves that he deserves to be called the son of Julius Caesar,” Lillian quipped with a chuckle. After all, Caesar was famous for building rapid fortifications whenever he faced a challenge, and reinforcing them magically so quickly that they turned impenetrable. </p><p>“Enough lesson,” I murmured. “We need to find a place I can ward safely so you can rest. I don’t want you to stay in the open with such a thick mana flow. We have no idea about the side effects.” </p><p>“What about you?” Astrid asked. </p><p>“Don’t worry, I’m strong enough to ignore the effects,” I said. “But we need to find a place to rest.” </p><p>“Can’t we just find a cave nearby?” Astrid questioned. </p><p>“Not safe enough,” I said. “It would be for the best if we can find an intact house.” </p><p>“Can you really take control of the remnants of the wards?” Lillian said. “And why bother. Can’t we just establish new wards easily, and it would be safer.” </p><p>“It would be easier, no doubt, but not necessarily safer,” I explained, and she looked at me in askance. “We still don’t know the identity of our enemies, or their capabilities. Still, if this city stayed untouched for centuries, I’m willing to trust their defenses more than anything I can establish in a couple of days. Certainly not without a proper wardstone and rune-carving tools.” Lillian nodded. I pinned them with one last look. “Don’t move anywhere. The wards are dangerous even for me. If you trigger something, I doubt that I could react quick enough to save you.” </p><p>After receiving their promises, I finally took a step inside the city, flaring my magical senses to the maximum. For the first time since my Ascension, I felt the weight of an immediate threat. One mistake, and the wards would collapse on top of me, erasing me from existence. Yes, they had weakened over the centuries, eroding thanks to the endless scourge of the mana storms, but that also made them unpredictable. Even while walking through the streets, I had to be aware, because some of the wards had problems in their borders, and spilling into the street, forcing me to be careful at every single step. </p><p>Ideally, the best way to deal with the wards was to find the central wardstone, and using that to restructure the wards. There was only one problem. The location of the central wardstone in a settlement was the biggest secret, as the destruction of it would result in the whole ward scheme exploding as well. Naturally, it was hidden perfectly even for a normal town. For this one, established as a secret base by either the most infamous Roman general, or his almost-equally infamous nephew and adopted son, finding it was harder than finding a lost caravan in the middle of a desert. </p><p>So, I walked through the ruined streets, looking for a residence. Then, my senses flared, and I threw myself to the side, avoiding a sudden flare of flame, resulting from an oversensitive trigger, but I wasn’t fast enough to completely avoid the blow. “Damn it,” I murmured as I grabbed my left arm, which was already blistering under the heat, and prepared to cast a healing spell. </p><p>Only to receive, this time a happy one. As soon as I started flexing my magic, the burn and the blisters disappeared in seconds. I had noticed my enhanced regeneration, but I wasn’t expecting it to be this strong. </p><p>With my wound cured, I turned my attention to the ward that injured me. At first, I was expecting to find a damaged ward overreacting to my presence, but even a cursory examination showed that it was not correct. No, the featureless building that stood in front of me disguising as a warehouse had one of the most complicated ward schemes I had ever seen. More impressively, unlike the other wards, the exquisite and very dangerous wards around the building were actually still functional, though still excessively weakened from the damaging environment and ravages of the time. </p><p>It was impossible for me to unravel those wards in a few days, but that didn’t mean that they were completely useless. Their potent presence actually stabilized the surrounding region, keeping both the physical parts and the ward schemes of the private houses around it. After a quick search, I picked a house that was in decent condition, and after reinforcing its wards for a while, returned to the girls. </p><p>However, even as trotted the streets, my mind was on the wards I discovered, and the mysteries that lay under their protection… </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Where are we going,” Cornelia cried in shock as I suddenly changed direction, tightening my grip around her waist. Then, she looked back, only to realize the whole monster horde had changed directions, and following us instead. “What’s going on!” she cried in shock. </p><p>“In simplest terms, necromancers were directing the horde with this gem, and since I have it, they are following us.” </p><p>“How!” she shouted, before suddenly stopping. “No, that’s not important. It’s good that they are following us. It’ll give us a chance to alert the Commander, and they can gather a team.” She raised her hand, and her mana flared, no doubt about to cast a noticeable flare spell to alert anyone close to us. </p><p>I grabbed her hand to interrupt her. “Sweetie, I was serious when I said that I’m going to handle it. You just need to sit back and enjoy the show,” I said, even as I looked around, trying to find a decent position to funnel the monsters. I could have tried to take them in an open field, but why bother when they were mindlessly following me. A more defensive position would turn the defense into a trivial achievement. </p><p>It didn’t take long for me to find a small valley that would slow down their initial charge, and more importantly, would prevent them from escaping even after the death of the earth turtle. As I passed through the entrance, I quickly drew several runes, but leave them inactivated. Once we were center of the valley, I dispelled the air elemental, much to Cornelia’s shock. </p><p>She watched me in shock as I used my mana to etch runes in a wide circle around us in several layers. Thanks to the speed advantage of the elemental, I had about ten minutes before the rest of the horde arrived, just enough to refill my mana while also setting a temporary defensive position. I drew three circles of defensive runes, injecting enough mana to each to hold the monsters for a small while. I could have put more, but I wasn’t trying to set up an extended defense here. I just needed a few minutes. </p><p>[-251 Mana]</p><p>“This is where we are going to put a defense together,” Cornelia asked in shock. “This is a horrible defensive location, we don’t have anything to isolate our flanks or our rear, and we need to make sure we’re not surrounded by the other creatures.” Frankly, for a team with similar strength to her, these concerns were not wrong. By putting a defense here, not only I risked being surrounded, but also the monsters would have no problem attacking in a combined manner. Creating a fake elemental took half a minute, making it a bad choice for an emergency gateway. </p><p>I felt curious about the potential of the earth gem, so I used it as a medium while casting an earth spell to create a seat. </p><p>[-14 Mana]</p><p>The results were spectacular. Transformation of earth mana flowed in an ease that surprised even me, allowing me to effortlessly create an intimidating throne in the middle of the defensive circles, resting intimidatingly on a raised platform that was created by the same spell. Impressive, I thought. I was starting to understand why people were willing to commit crimes just for a rumor of a natural magical gem. </p><p>“Isn’t it too much-” Cornelia said as I took a seat, only to be silenced when I grabbed her wrist and pulled her closer before forcing her down her knees, also lowering my pants. “Since we have some time to kill,” I drawled lazily. </p><p>“You’re mad,” she gasped, but with the front of her robe revealingly wide, I could easily see her stiffening nipples and moistening core. She was aroused by my confidence, even though it looked awful like recklessness. </p><p>“You better start if you want to make any progress before the monsters arrive at the valley,” I said, reminding her that at best we had just minutes. Of course, I had no intention of interrupting it even as the monsters arrived, but I didn’t say that to her immediately, giving her a moment to get used to the idea. </p><p>I grabbed the back of her head and pulled her toward my enthusiastic erection, not that she was resisting much, her mouth already parted open enthusiastically. The revulsion she had shown the first time was completely absent, along with her concerns that whether serving me with her mouth like a tavern wench was fitting to a noble heiress like her. The way her tongue wrapped around my length enthusiastically showed just how far she had come in a few short days. </p><p>Normally, I would have let her attack my shaft at her own pace, but this moment was about proving my overwhelming power to her, and I wanted to start it on the right note. “Brace yourself,” I commented even as I grabbed the back of her head, and forced her to swallow most of my length in one move, no matter how loud she gagged in the process. “Don’t fight it,” I commented even as I pushed once more, pushing my remaining length into her throat, making her gag helplessly. </p><p>Her hands tightened around my thighs, not to free herself, but seeking more strength to keep her place. She was learning. I let her rise for a moment, giving her the chance to breathe, before pushing her down once more, and started fucking her throat mercilessly, ignoring her occasional pained gasps. As she struggled, I cast a simple spell to remove her robe, but not completely. No, when she brought her arms to her back to let the robe slide away, I flicked my finger, and the robe twisted around her arms, suddenly turning into an armbinder, tight enough to hurt. With my cock lodged deep into her throat, she couldn’t even react to it. </p><p>I only let her pull back when the first monsters started to enter the valley, and at that time, my mana reserves had finally recovered. I waited until the first group was close to the defenses before letting Cornelia pull out. The only reason she didn’t collapse as she coughed was my tight grip on her hair, keeping her upright. With her own body’s painful reminders, it took a few seconds for her to notice the monsters. “Caesar-” she gasped, but I cut it with a spell, not on her but against the monsters. </p><p>[-17 Mana]</p><p>It was a simple fireball spell, or more accurately, it was supposed to be. But it burned brighter than a deadly explosion spell that would leave a weaker caster exhausted, expelling waves of her heat thick enough to be felt over our skin despite the distance. It immolated the monsters in an instant, their low-class resistance no match for even a weak spell from me. Using Tantric, I could feel several invisible pieces of energy leaving their bodies and rushing toward me. From my earlier experimentations with Aviada, I had learned that it was the phenomenon that caused the experience gain. </p><p>I also discovered how to redirect it, removing the biggest challenge in power-leveling people, namely, the need to deliver the final hit. </p><p>Cornelia’s eyes widened as she received the experience, but I cut in before she could say anything. “Don’t waste time, continue sucking,” I ordered even as I pushed her down, feeling her lips around my shaft once more. This time, I didn’t push her for a deepthroat, and satisfied with her enthusiastic bobbing, accompanied by the skillful dance of her tongue. Conveniently, it left my hands free to direct my magic, raining fireballs against the first wave of the monsters. </p><p>It was the reason I picked a hard-to-access valley for my defense. As they entered in relatively smaller groups, it gave me an excuse to pick them easily while giving myself enough time to regain the mana I spent, bequeathing Cornelia experience in the process. It wasn’t much, just a few points of experience for each monster considering the gap between Cornelia and the monsters, but considering their numbers, still very impressive. </p><p>“Uh-huh,” Cornelia moaned, her voice distorted by my shaft, her enjoyment clear. Her cheeks bulged, and her spit dripped down as she attacked my length rapidly, but I could sense that her attention was flickering. I didn’t begrudge her for that. Considering we were under attack from a monster horde, her distraction was understandable. </p><p>The next few minutes passed in a weird routine where I received a delicious —if a bit mechanical— service from Cornelia while burning the first wave of attackers into cinders. Like the Swordsmanship before, I was rather satisfied with the performance of the specialized Fire magic, not that I was regretting taking the more generalist route to elements. Still, the qualitative transformation I was experiencing in my area-effect damage was impressive, allowing me to easily fend the attacks without spending more mana than I could regenerate. </p><p>[-965 Mana]</p><p>[Mana: 3720/3840]</p><p>However, soon, things started to get heated. With a loud clatter, the entrance of the valley collapsed, finally allowing the monsters to spill inside, probably done by the earth tortoise. It was definitely strong enough to handle that. </p><p>Cornelia gasped in shock as she pulled away, turning to the walls with clear panic in her eyes. “We need to escape before you deplete your mana-” she started, but I interrupted her by grabbing her waist and forcing her to face away before I pulled her onto my lap. </p><p>“Honey, the show is just starting, watch carefully,” I whispered throatily even as I aligned my shaft with her entrance, pressing against the entrance. Meanwhile, countless monsters filled the valley, and my fireballs nothing more than a matchstick against a tornado, trying to stay alive. She shivered, but didn’t otherwise protest as I let my shaft slowly penetrate her. She was rightfully afraid, but still willing to wait when I assured her that I had a plan. The monsters rushed against the outer wall of runes, but with a wave, I created an invisible wall of air, keeping them away, giving myself the time required to charge the second circle of runes, which was my main assault, and those runes devoured mana like crazy. </p><p>[-2108 Mana]</p><p>Cornelia was far too busy watching the wave of monsters slowly chipping down our outer layer of defenses, while more and more monsters piled behind them. Meanwhile, I put my hands on her waist, directing her movements as my shaft disappeared into her bit by bit. When the outer defenses were finally fallen, Cornelia was jumping up and down in her own accord, even though her face contorted with fear, her arms still bound behind her back. She could have easily burned it away, of course. The fact that she didn’t, still trusting me despite her hesitancy showed just how far we had come. </p><p>“Do you want to see a really impressive piece of magic,” I whispered even as I forced her down, fully impaling her, accompanied by her moan. </p><p>“Yes!” she moaned loudly, making me doubt whether she was answering my question or reacting to the pleasure of my invasion. However, the monsters had finally penetrated the outer wave of defenses, making it inconvenient to tease her. </p><p>“As you wish,” I said as I pushed another wave of mana. First, I triggered both the innermost circle, which created another defensive layer —this time a combination of water and air elements— to protect us, and the runes I had left at the entrance, which suddenly created a hundred feet tall stone wall, cutting their way to escape. “Inferno Eternal!” I cried as I triggered the middle layer of runes, while using the rest of my mana to ignite the mana I had stored. </p><p>The result was spectacular. The valley, which was previously covered in monsters, suddenly set ablaze, turning into a veritable hellscape. Flickering flames rose higher than a hundred feet, its heat enough to penetrate the water nature, just enough to make our location deliciously crisp. Luckily, the elemental nature of the defenses was enough to both supply us with air, and to keep the smell away. </p><p>[-920 Mana]</p><p>“Impossible,” Cornelia gasped as she watched the spell to cover the entirety of the valley. Her shock was understandable, as my spell didn’t look like something that could be done by a single person, especially not without the assistance of an established ward. First of all, the spell cost more than three thousand mana, which was a number unthinkable for almost all mages, even if they were above thirty. The only reason I had such a high capability was because of my ridiculous stats. Moreover, the spell showed the perfect attainment of all of my mental stats. Charisma for sheer power, the intelligence and manipulation to still control, wisdom to maintain its nature, and perception shape its borders perfectly. </p><p>The spell was a true masterpiece, equivalent to a masterpiece painting, only temporary, but even more impressive. </p><p>And as an aspiring fire mage, Cornelia was the perfect person to experience the majesty of such a spell. “Incredible,” she murmured as she picked up speed, followed by a cry as she rode me in reckless abandon. Her eyes were wide open despite the brightness, tears slipping down her cheeks as she was impressed. Another gasp escaped her mouth as the monsters started to die in droves, only for her to receive every almost half of the experience it created —even for me, directing all of it was not possible— pushing her steadily toward a new level. </p><p>However, it wasn’t as important as a very welcome notification that I planned, and another welcome one I hadn’t planned. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 77%]</p><p>[Achievement: Fiery Flirting. Who said that the flames of destruction worthy of hell couldn’t be sexy. +1000 Experience, +3 Charisma]</p><p>Finally the fourth stage, I thought with glee even as I grabbed Cornelia’s hips, and a nice achievement as a bonus for my excellent performance rivaling an artwork. I slammed even harder into her, my thickness fighting against her tightening walls, her arousal off-the-charts. I was tempted to tease her a bit, but I realized the moment turned into a holy moment for her, her fascination mixing with her arousal enough to drown her higher mental functions.  </p><p> I sank my hands to her ass, enjoying its firmness even as I slammed even harder, and Cornelia just moaned in response, her eyes locked on the fiery show that was going on. I said nothing, as there was nothing to do but enjoy the moment. I had designed the spell to last five minutes, and interrupting it would have actually taken more of my strength. Instead, I was sitting in the heart of the inferno comfortably, mercilessly fucking my noble maid while also recovering my mana. </p><p>“You like it, don’t you, my poor servant,” I murmured. “You like being my maid, my toy, and my slave, the knowledge that I’m strong enough to destroy you with a flick of my hand, but using that power to make you mine, both body and soul.” </p><p>“Yes,” Cornelia moaned. “I’m yours, master, both in body and soul!” And when I finally cummed, it triggered her climax, her trembling body mixing with her loud cries. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 81%]</p><p>Her words soon turned into slurring moans as she was overcome with pleasure, trembling badly. As the fires weakened, Cornelia collapsed against my chest, murmuring absentmindedly. “Another level,” she murmured dazedly as she rested against my chest, watching the flickering embers as the spell collapsed, leaving the valley filled with smoke and cinders. Another wave of my hand, and a sudden wind picked up the smoke, while making the cinders burn brightly. </p><p>There was almost no movement in the valley, which, admittedly, wasn’t as impressive as it sounded, considering only a few rare monsters were above class ten. Not that destroying it by one spell wasn’t impressive, of course. However, a subtle movement caught my attention. A large mound, which a careless observer might have mistaken for a geographical feature, suddenly moved. </p><p>It was the earth tortoise. </p><p>“How the hell it’s still alive,” I murmured in shock even as I cast an earth spell, creating a sudden ground wave that brought it closer despite its struggles. It was a creature of earth, but the power difference between us absolute, so I was easily able to dominate it through its own element. Cornelia, lying against my chest, my shaft still inside her, barely reacted. </p><p>I could feel the hint of a peculiar energy from the body of the tortoise, one I would have dismissed as the transformative energy that turned it into a horde leader, but it felt weirdly familiar. Curious, I waved my hand, using an air blade to cut through its defensive shell before dissecting it. I didn’t bother to keep the materials, because it was a mere class twelve creature even with its transformation, making it useless for my purposes. To inspire Oeyne, I needed better material.  </p><p>However, when I cut through the monster in search of a source, I met with a very interesting surprise. I found another earth gem, but this one with a slightly chaotic feel. I tried to focus on the sensation, but before I could even grab it, the chaotic sensation had dispelled, leaving only a burning question behind… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 24    Experience: 296400 / 300000 </p><p>Strength: 28    Charisma: 41</p><p>Precision: 24    Perception: 27</p><p>Agility: 25     Manipulation: 30</p><p>Speed: 23       Intelligence: 32</p><p>Endurance: 22      Wisdom: 33</p><p>HP: 2899 / 2928\tMana: 2154 / 3912        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Expert Arcana [75/75]        </p><p>Expert Subterfuge [75/75]         </p><p>Basic Speech [25/25]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p>",

    "content": "<p>Moments later, I was moving deeper into the wilderness on top of a faux air elemental, still carrying an unconscious Cornelia on my lap, trying to find some prey worthy of hunting. I wanted to test the limits of the temporary skills I had received, with both Fire Magic and Swordsmanship active, curious about the level of improvement. When my mana was halfway drained, we finally arrived at the target location, and I immediately found a small cave to set up another safe house, but only after laying Cornelia on a soft pile of leaves and kissing her on the cheek.</p><p>[-4620 Mana]</p><p>“Wake up, sleepyhead,” I said as I pulled back, only for her to grab my arm. </p><p>“Five more minutes,” she murmured as she shuffled, trying to pull me to her side. And as much as I wanted to lay next to her while resting, I had more important things to focus on, so I gently extracted myself, but let her sleep for a bit more. After all, I still needed to finish reinforcing the cave. Luckily, after setting up all those safe houses, creating one was a trivial task that didn’t deserve my full attention. Instead, I started thinking about the Companion System progress of Cornelia. </p><p>The latest improvement, reaching the third stage of the completion, surprised me. Considering our initial belligerent start, I hadn’t been expecting her to reach such an impressive point that quickly. Her level cap must have been distressing her even worse than I had expected, and power-leveling her on top of that must have gone a long way to ensure her loyalty. After all, progressing from level fifteen to sixteen usually required either weeks of concentrated dangerous solo hunting, or a large team invading a dangerous area for the sole purpose of power-leveling a young noble. </p><p>Essentially, it was a miracle not that much inferior to breaking through her level cap. No wonder she was truly impressed. </p><p>I racked my brain trying to come up with the final step of the relationship. With Helga, I had a feeling that it was about allowing her to finally get the acknowledgment of her skills, which required me to either bring Titania into the inner circle or establish a healthy connection with the faculty before I could do that, which required quite a bit of progress. Of course, that was just an assumption, and the fourth stage might have a completely different requirement. Aviada was also a mystery, as it might be about either dominating her or helping her get even stronger. Her personality was too weird to properly predict as she seemed to like dominating and being dominated in equal measures. </p><p>As I thought about the girls, a sudden inspiration hit my mind. Cornelia was wired to power, so maybe showing overwhelming strength to her, especially on her chosen area of expertise, might do the trick. Even better, it worked my plan to help her level up perfectly. Even if it didn’t work, there would be no loss, and I would still achieve my aim of testing the extent of my new fire magic abilities. As I worked, my mana reserves recovered thanks to my insane regeneration despite the expenditure, signaling me to finally start to move.</p><p>[-926 Mana]</p><p>Cornelia started to wake up as I put the finishing touches on the safe house. She stretched, which gave me a beautiful glimpse of her tight body since she was wearing a robe and nothing else, and the front of her robe was conveniently parted, allowing me to observe her beautiful peaks. “You’re finally awake,” I said with a chuckle as I walked to her, and offered my hand. </p><p>“Where are we?” she asked curiously even as she grabbed my hand, and I pulled her on her feet, but rather than answering, kissed her aggressively, while also using the opportunity to inject a fresh wave of mana into her soul space, reinforcing the borders to make sure she could continue to level up. Since I had already discovered the way to do that, achieving that was a trivial achievement. </p><p>[-737 Mana] </p><p>“We’re about one hundred and fifty miles south of the school,” I explained. “It’s a good night for hunt.” </p><p>“One hundred and fifty,” she gasped. “How long I had been asleep?” </p><p>“Something like twenty, twenty-five minutes, why?” I said with a dismissive shrug, despite being fully aware of the reason for her shock. The ability to move that quickly was a very precious commodity, almost as impressive as my combat capabilities. And it was hard to replicate without some very precious magical items, because not many people had my mana to burn. Not only my mana reserves were bigger than even Titania at this point, but also I had an insane regeneration capacity. Hence the reason I could pull the insane trick with the imitation air elemental. Cornelia’s fascination was understandable. </p><p>And it was just a small part of my plan to impress her. </p><p>“Shall we,” I said even as I presented her my arm, and she put her arm on mine, ready to walk out of the cave-like we were just about to enter a high society event. She reached to close the front of her robe to tighten, but I shook my head to prevent her. After all, we were in the middle of the wilderness, and I was the only one that could see her beautiful body. Why shouldn’t I make our hunting trip more interesting visually? </p><p>“We shall, milord,” she said mockingly, with a chuckle, surprising me a bit. It was impressive just how much she had mellowed after a merciless fucking. </p><p>We walked out, and I waved my hand, conjuring the faux air elemental once more. “Your chariot awaits, milady.” </p><p>“W-what, how,” she gasped as she watched, her panic only subsiding after realizing it was a fake conjuration rather than the real deal. A true elemental, even the weakest one, was a disaster, after all. I took my seat before pulling her on my lap. When she felt my hard-on, rather than flinching, she started wiggling sexily, intensifying my little problem even further. I was lucky that the solution was not too far away. </p><p>I sent two waves of detection, one with a shorter range to detect any type of monster but only if the creature was strong enough, the other a biomancy wave to detect the presence of undead. </p><p>I wasn’t expecting positive responses to both of the spells at the same time, and from the same location. “What’s wrong,” Cornelia asked, positioned perfectly to feel my body stiffen suddenly.</p><p>“Nothing much, I just need to check something,” I said even as I moved toward the target. After everything, the necromancers' presence wasn’t exactly a surprise. And the amount I detected wasn’t even a surprise, but the same couldn’t be applied for the living monsters I had detected. It felt truly overwhelming. </p><p>With the overwhelming speed of the elemental, it barely took a minute for me to get close enough to observe, only to met with another surprise. I saw a bone dragon, carrying three necromancers on top of it as it moved forward, but that wasn’t the surprising part. </p><p>No, the surprise was the monster horde that was chasing after them. “Fuck,” I murmured even as Cornelia trembled in fear. </p><p>I didn’t begrudge her for that. After all, monster hordes were a unique phenomenon that was responsible for the majority of the lost towns and cities. It happened when a monster went through a unique transformation, getting several classes stronger in the process, and losing its sanity in the process, and started roaming the wilds, looking for an opponent. Most of the time, it was harmless, as it eventually died at the hands of the other monsters, or hunted by an experienced team if it was too close to a city. </p><p>However, sometimes, very rarely, the transformed monster gained the ability to dominate the weaker monsters, sharing its craziness with them as well. And suddenly, a crazy but strong monster turned into a growing group of crazy monsters willing to destroy everything on their way. If undetected, it took only a few days for a horde to form, and after a certain size, even the stronger monsters started to avoid them. And after that, if they were left undetected, they grew into a tsunami, dangerous enough to destroy the towns or even the cities that they faced. This way, even a weak rabbit could turn into a threat that could engulf a town. A rabbit wasn’t dangerous, but thousands of them, all in a mindless craze, could overwhelm the defenses of a small town in minutes, before reinforcements could even be organized.</p><p>Destroying a horde also took a lot of effort. Killing the regular monsters was the worst way to do that, as their numbers regularly passed tens of thousands, and sometimes, even hitting millions, with a potential to destroy even the strongest fortresses. </p><p>The most efficient way to destroy a horde was to kill the monster in the core of the horde. Killing the monster usually caused the horde to lose its cohesion, and without the mindless recklessness, they were much easier to push back. Killing the leading monster before they could reach a settlement was even better, as, without an external threat, the monsters would probably start fighting against each other, dispersing harmlessly. Too bad that the team responsible for assassinating the leading monster seldom survived. </p><p>Trying to penetrate into a mindless horde of monsters strong enough to threaten a city was hardly an activity bookies would classify as a sure bet. </p><p>Luckily, the monster horde in front of us was still in its early stages, measured in low thousands, and only a few hundreds of them class five or higher. The core monster was an earth tortoise, which looked big enough to be mature, meaning it was likely class twelve or higher. That part would have been bad news for a city, because while earth tortoises were relatively weak creatures, they had a defense that was impenetrable for anything at their own level, which would have made assassinating it a difficult task for a town. </p><p>Luckily, it didn’t apply to me. I was more worried about the presence of the necromancers. Their movement speed was not even close to the maximum a bone dragon could move. Moreover, one of the trio was carrying a bright gem in hand, and that gem was radiating a thick flavor of earth-natured mana, strong enough to be felt even from a distance. Such a strong magical material was not cheap, not even close. </p><p>Mana gems true magical miracles. They were different from regular crystals or monster materials, as they could recover their own mana, making them really excellent tools for forging top-tier magical weapons, or establishing strong wards that don’t require constant supervision. There wasn’t a noble family that wouldn’t mobilize their strongest team just to explore the rumors of their existence. </p><p>However, getting one was always a difficult and bloody affair, and not because of the rivalry between the teams. Humans weren’t the only ones that battled for their ownership. Monsters fought for them even harder than humans did, because their constant radiance could strengthen them significantly through exposure, even triggering bloodline evolutions if they were lucky enough, especially if the gem and the monster shared the same nature. </p><p>No wonder the tortoise was following them recklessly. A gem of the same nature was a hard find. </p><p>The necromancers clearly using it as bait to lead the horde toward a town, but it didn’t make much sense. How the fuck the necromancers had a gem in the same nature lying in their reserve free, ready to be used immediately as they discovered a horde. There was a reason using gems to pull the monster hordes away wasn’t a more widely applied strategy. It only worked if the leading monster’s type matched with the gem, and moreover, it was only effective when the horde was below a certain size. They had to react minutes after the monster was transformed, as communicating the news, bringing the gem, and enchanting the monster all needed to happen in a short window. </p><p>“Fuck,” I murmured with a frown, unhappy with yet another mysterious ability the necromancers had revealed. The more I came across them, the more I’m starting to believe that they wanted something even more impressive than just destroying Silver Spires. I chuckled. Like destroying Silver Spires wasn’t ambitious enough. </p><p>“We should go back and alert the Commander,” Cornelia gasped in shock. “It’s a crisis.” </p><p>“What,” I murmured at Cornelia’s reaction. </p><p>“The horde. We need reinforcements,” she spoke rapidly as she shook my shoulder, trying to goad me into action. </p><p>It took a moment for me to understand her reaction, then I chuckled. She clearly assumed my shock was about the threat the horde and the necromancers were posing immediately, and not the implications. “Honey, no need to panic, these guys are nothing more than a warm-up,” I explained. </p><p>“Nonsense, it’s a horde!” she exclaimed, forcing me to cast a silencing spell hurriedly prevent alerting necromancers. “You can’t sacrifice yourself,” she added, hugging me tightly, her naked body pressing against mine. </p><p>“Sweetie, as much as I like your hugs, this is not even a threat, trust me,” I said. “Now, just step down for a moment and watch me.” </p><p>Despite everything she had seen me doing until now, I doubted she would have believed me if I hadn’t been blasting her with the full might of my charisma. Even then, she had a doubtful expression on her face as she stepped down the elemental. </p><p>First, I needed to deal with the necromancers to prevent any nasty surprise. Luckily, without a horde of undead around them, they were even less of a threat, so I decided to test my extended melee capabilities. I charged toward them recklessly, using the full speed of the elemental, not bothering to hide. </p><p>One of the necromancers let out an alarm, followed by a rain of death rays. I could have attacked them from range, or use life energy to shield myself, but that wouldn’t test my new abilities. Instead, I pulled Aviada’s sword, slashing every single bolt of necrotic energy, dispelling them effortlessly. They reacted fast enough, every spell creating a pile of arrows rather than a singular bolt, but even that was nothing for me. I didn’t even bother changing my route, the sword moving fast enough to create a defensive orbit around me, the necrotic energy never coming nearer than several inches. </p><p>One of the necromancers pulled a talisman, no doubt to trigger some kind of an alarm or communication device, but they were too late. I was already in melee range, and a slash later, the talisman flew away, along with its bony hand. Three slashes, charged with biomancy energy, resulted in the destruction of the necromancers, and a fourth slash destroyed the bone dragon’s head alongside the unholy magics that kept it together. </p><p>The whole combat lasted less than five seconds from the first spell to the destruction of the bone dragon. “Damn,” I murmured even as I caught the earth gem in the air, impressed with the enhanced capabilities given by the specialized skill. It was definitely a notch above my usual capabilities. </p><p>With the necromancer dead —deader— the earth gem’s aura started to dim, so I injected a few points of mana to keep it active. Just two points of mana were enough to make it radiate even brighter than the necromancer did, but it was likely about my elemental capabilities, making it much easier for me to manipulate it. </p><p>Then, I reversed my direction, sweeping up Cornelia into my arms before changing direction. “How,” she gasped in shock, trying to process the fact that I had just destroyed three necromancers and a bone dragon in less time than it would take to prepare a plate of fruit into a delicious and nutritious salad. </p><p>“Honey, you haven’t seen anything yet,” I said as I moved deeper into the wilderness, a monster horde on our heels… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 24    Experience: 295400 / 300000 </p><p>Strength: 28    Charisma: 38</p><p>Precision: 24    Perception: 27</p><p>Agility: 25     Manipulation: 30</p><p>Speed: 23       Intelligence: 32</p><p>Endurance: 22      Wisdom: 33</p><p>HP: 2899 / 2928\tMana: 2154 / 3840        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Expert Arcana [75/75]        </p><p>Expert Subterfuge [75/75]         </p><p>Basic Speech [25/25]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p>",

    "content": "<p>After the debacle with her picture, Anna was silent, her attention firmly on the drawings, avoiding my attempts to initiate a discussion. I didn’t bother much, as it was clear that she had firmly defined her identity based on her strong academic credentials, and her lack of physical allure, and with one move, I had broken through the latter pillar of her outward personality. No wonder she was confused. </p><p>Of course, I was familiar with female psychology enough to know that the effectiveness of such a move relied quite a bit on her existing attraction. If I was a skinny nerdy boy, she would have dismissed it as an attempt of trying to seduce another nerdy girl. It was weird just how several pounds of muscle and a symmetrical face could make a man more trustworthy. </p><p>Since she was more interested in processing her shock rather than speaking with me, I asked her to go back to RV, to start driving. The current camping area was nice, but not enough to spend two nights in a row. While I drove, she sat on the couch, making a show of keeping her attention on her e-book reader, though I didn’t miss that she had put my drawings to the table, close enough that she could glance on them whenever she wanted, followed by a long look at her reflection on the mirror, as she desperately tried to compare the two. </p><p>I wondered whether she was trying to convince herself that my drawing was true, or false… </p><p>The drive until noon passed in silence, until I saw a large mall in the middle of nowhere, completely empty. It was one of the huge malls that were built in the middle of nowhere at the intersection of several cities, to allow bargain hunters to shop for a full day. Those places were always packed at the weekends, and saw a decent crowd in the evenings, but at midweek noon, they were more like a ghost town. </p><p>Perfect time to buy a couple of things for my wayward passenger if I could convince them. </p><p>“Are you up to eat something that wasn’t frozen or from a can?” I asked, but took the exit without waiting for an answer. </p><p>“That would be nice,” she answered, which didn’t surprise me the slightest. She stayed subdued even as we parked the RV, found a nice but inexpensive restaurant with a lot of selection, and joined my idle talk only when it was necessary as we ate, clearly trying to gather the courage to breach the subject, but failing repeatedly. </p><p>Only when we were waiting for the check, she managed to ask it. “Do you really think I’m actually beautiful,” she whispered hesitantly. </p><p>I could have just laughed it off, or gave her a quick answer, but that wouldn’t work well for my intention. Instead of answering instantly, I met with her eyes, and she stayed hypnotized by the sudden sharpness of my gaze. “Do you want me to prove it?” </p><p>The way her breathing quickened was beautiful, especially when it pushed her chest up, enough to give a hint of the treasure underneath even with the sack she was wearing that was disguising itself as a t-shirt. Even with my experience, I could have never guessed the true beauty of the treasure that lay underneath her ugly clothing if she hadn’t been ‘kind’ enough to give me an extended show the last night. Even then, it was hard to believe the last night wasn’t just a dream. </p><p>For a moment, I was afraid that I had pushed too much, that she was about to reject my nebulous offer, but after a minute of tense silence, she whispered. “How?” </p><p>“Let’s start with your posture,” I whispered as I slid my chair closer and put my hand on her shoulder, enjoying the way she trembled as my touch slid down along her spine. “Push your chest a bit more, and straighten your shoulders. The first step of being beautiful is to own it. If you lack the confidence in yourself, no one would truly think you’re pretty, no matter how cute you are.” Then, with a widening smirk, I added. “And believe me, you are cute.” </p><p>“R-really,” she stammered, unable to handle the full strength of my crooked smirk. </p><p>“Of course, why would I lie,” I said even as I continued to caress her back despite it being unnecessary. Normally, I would have been slower when flirting, but considering she had chosen to molest me while sleeping, she didn’t deserve such considerations. No, she was about to receive a full blast of my flirting. We fall silent, but I kept my hand on her back, trailing down to the small of her back, making her shiver. </p><p>I only pulled my hand away when the check arrived. I paid the check and we left the restaurant, though only to put my hand back on the small of her back when she tried to turn toward the parking area. “Where are you going?” I asked her. </p><p>“To the RV?” she questioned. </p><p>“Not yet. Did you forget that I need to prove something to you?” She looked at me questioningly, and I smirked. “We’re going shopping.” </p><p>“No!” she gasped, panicked. “I hate shopping! Please.” </p><p>“Sweetie, you don’t hate shopping. You’re bad at shopping,” I said, then paused. “Or, your mother is bad at shopping.” Her blush suggested that it was the second option. She still looked resistant, but I kept my hand on the small of her back as I led her toward a large department store, acting unaware of her blush as we passed a high-end lingerie store. As much as I would have liked to get her there and try some lingerie, I didn’t want her brain to melt in shock. </p><p>\"Don’t forget to stand straight even as you walk,\" I reminded her, giving a few detailed requests. She immediately did as she was told, lifting her head up, straightening her back, and without realizing it, pushing out her plump tits out enough to get the attention of the passersby, both male and female, though she was luckily unaware of the last part, too distracted by my touch. “Now, let’s move onto the next part, try to move your hips a bit more.” </p><p>“But-” she tried to say, but I wasn’t above cutting her off by pressing my fingers to her lips, which silenced her perfectly in exchange for another thick blush. </p><p>“No, you definitely have the hips for it despite the best effort of those abominable sweatpants. Shake your hips more,” I ordered, followed by several practical commands to best achieve the effect. One good advantage of being a painter who moonlighted as a bouncer was to have a very good relationship with several models, who spent most of their time in the club so relied on our protection, but also fascinated by the idea of a classical painter —mostly from the narcissistic angle of immortalizing their beauty in a different form. I had been commissioned a great number of naked portraits, and I was rarely get paid with money. But since most of them weren’t the sharpest tool in the shed in terms of interesting conversations, I had often defaulted to asking about their modeling experiences and techniques, the only thing their expertise that could be helpful for my own painting career.</p><p>Luckily, the outlet mall was huge, so we had quite a bit of distance to practice. Five minutes later, at the entrance of the huge department store, Anna’s walk had transformed from the boring lumbering of a nerdy girl to the beginnings of a sexy strut. She obviously had a lot to improve, of course, but luckily, we also had quite a bit of time.   </p><p>I couldn’t help but chuckle as she stood in the middle of the department store, no different than a quarterback who was asked to solve a complicated physics problem on the whiteboard. I chuckled as I led her toward the female side. There were only a few customers, and since most of them were over sixty and killing time in their retirement, I had no problem focusing on Anna. “Let’s start with something simple,” I said as I quickly picked several t-shirts, all of them tight enough to reveal her beautiful figure without being too sexy. They weren’t my ultimate aim, of course. I just wanted her to get used to wearing something a bit more form-fitting while I searched for something more impressive. </p><p>She blushed, but didn’t resist when I grabbed her hand and dragged her toward the dressing rooms. After she disappeared behind a thick curtain, I went back to the store, quickly picking several more items, including some really tight jeans, skirts to put her deliciously-thick thighs on display, as well as tank tops and spaghetti-straps to finally pay her top the respect it deserved. </p><p>When I arrived, she was still behind the curtain. “How are you doing?” I asked, faking concern. “Everything alright?” </p><p>“Y-yeah, perfect,” she stammered even as the curtain moved with a sudden wind, suggesting that she had jumped in shock at my words. “I have just put on the t-shirt.” </p><p>“Excellent,” I said as I pulled the curtain without a warning, making her gasp in shock. “What,” I shrugged carelessly. “You told me that you’re ready.” </p><p>Even when she had already told that she was dressed, pulling the curtain open without her permission was still an overreach, but Anna was far too shy to defend her in such a nuanced topic, and let it slide. Instead, she stood in front of me, fidgeting, her arms crossed around her chest. “How do I look?” she whispered. I shook my head disapprovingly. She blanched, with the beginnings of tears appearing on the edges of her eyes. “You think it’s ugly.”</p><p>“No, I’m disappointed because you already forget your lesson. Keep your shoulders up, your back straight, and maintain eye contact. You are beautiful, own it!” </p><p>“R-right,” she stammered panickedly, but her sadness evaporated, which was a win. She followed my command, the motion straining her t-shirt even more, proving that it was tight around the chest. “It’s a bit difficult,” she admitted, her social anxiety rearing its head. </p><p>“Don’t worry, you look beautiful, but that t-shirt is not you, try the others,” I stated, and after a nod, she pulled the curtain close. I didn’t pass the other items I had picked for her, not wanting to scare her before she got used to modeling for me. Luckily, they had a couple of seats in the changing area, allowing me rest while she tried about six different t-shirts, none of them particularly impressive. More importantly, however, by the second one, she started remembering to stand without slouching like she tried to hide her body, and by the fifth one, her arms stopped flinching while she suppressed the desire to cover her chest behind her crossed arms. She was beautiful. Too bad that her bra was ruining the impact of her clothing. </p><p>“That’s the last of them,” she said, her blush continuing to spread. “Shall we go?” </p><p>I couldn’t help but chuckle as I pointed at the small pile next to me. “What are you talking about, we’re just starting,” I said even as I grabbed three jeans I had picked for her, and passed them on, despite my desire to see her in a miniskirt and low-cut spaghetti strap combo, especially if I could convince her to get rid of that ugly monstrosity that ruined the reputation of bras all around the world.</p><p>Maybe I should start working on that particular detail immediately, I decided as I walked to the underwear section, and started browsing, looking for a sexy set that was also cheap. Luckily, we were in an outlet, which meant I had a wide range of selections, especially since Anna’s sizes were not exactly flying off the shelf. She was somewhere between DD and E, and considering her relatively thin body meant that she was competing with a very small subsection of the population for clothes. </p><p>After some browsing, I found a cute baby-blue lacy set, strong enough to contain her assets without sacrificing much from sexiness. They were not the best options, of course, as that honor went to a transparent red set that wouldn’t look remiss on a stripper as she strutted to a private dance. Too bad that Anna would probably faint if I asked her to wear them. </p><p>However, I still put them in my shopping bag, as just because she didn’t wear them today didn’t mean that I couldn’t convince her to wear them later on. </p><p>A wide smile adorned my face as I walked back to the dressing section, the baby blue set lacy set in my hand, anticipating an amusing reaction. She didn’t surprise me when I arrived at the screened section that held the dressing rooms. Anna was waiting for my arrival, while also twirling in front of a mirror, examining the reflection of her hips under the tight wrap of her jeans. It looked exemplar. “How do I-” she started asking, only to freeze when she noticed what I had in hand. “That’s too much,” she gasped. </p><p>“That’s another lesson, wearing sexy underwear adds to your confidence,” I explained, and when she looked panicked enough to abort, I quickly continued to recover the situation. “Only you’ll know what you’re wearing underneath, but still, it will help a lot,” I added before moving to the final blow, sounding just vulnerable and disappointed enough. “Don’t you trust me?” </p><p>“Of course, I do!” she answered immediately before she could even think, inadvertently locking herself into the situation, and I had no intention of allowing her to extract herself. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said as I pulled off its price tag. Unlike the other items, shoppers were not allowed to try out underwear without actually buying, but I trusted my sense of measurement enough, especially after receiving such an extended show the night before. Her naked figure was still firm in my mind. </p><p>“But-” she tried to interject, only to be cut once again. </p><p>“Don’t worry, they are in deep discount, just a couple of dollars,” I explained. “I can gift them to you if you want,” I added without prompting, and making her blush enough to retreat behind the curtain. </p><p>I was about to pass the underwear to her by pushing the curtain, when I was struck with a fancy and added one of the tank tops to the package. It was a black one, and the most conservative among the items I had picked with almost no cleavage, but still, it was miles better than the t-shirts earlier, thanks to their elastic nature if nothing else. “Thanks,” came a muffled sound from the other side of the curtain, followed by a subdued shuffling, suggesting that she was trying out my gifts. </p><p>I couldn’t wait to see her new style… </p>",

    "content": "<p>I was still trying to decide how to progress as I pulled Aria on my lap. Aria froze, while I turned my attention to Emma, waiting for her to speak. “Why are you still here?” Emma asked, still in a daze as she looked at us. “Why didn’t you escape?” </p><p>She had finally processed her shock enough to ask a good question, I realized. From the way she stiffened on my lap, I could feel that Aria had the same question. “What do you think?” I asked even as I let my hands caress Aria’s naked belly, enjoying the smoothness of her stomach. She tried to stand up, only to decide against it when my arms tightened around her body. I really loved Aria’s lack of decisiveness. It was so convenient. </p><p>“I don’t know,” Emma answered, confused. “You could have just escaped the city before we realized your absence and sounded the alarm.” </p><p>“Well, you’re not wrong,” I answered. “And considering where this little secret tunnel is connecting, I could have easily assassinated several key people on my way to sow chaos, leaving the Capital in tethers,” I added, enjoying the way their faces contorted in shock, like they just remembered how I rose to the helm of the forces of darkness. “Any idea why I didn’t do that, but waited for this pretty girl’s arrival,” I added even as I let my hands rose, and cupped Aria’s tits. </p><p>“R-revenge,” Emma offered, while Aria froze under my touch, not unlike a cute rabbit that realized the inviting cavern she found was housing a dragon. I used the chance to test the perkiness of her breasts, sinking into her flesh deeper and deeper. </p><p>“Come on, my little redhead. You need to be more agile if you ever want to survive the palace politics,” I murmured in amusement. “Do you want to try again, or do you want me to enlighten you?” </p><p>“Please,” Emma murmured, her eyes still wide as she watched me grope Aria. And if I was reading the way her tongue darted involuntarily, she was starting to get aroused again. The memories she had watched the last night was really showing its effect, I surmised, another reason that her ill-conceived mental intrusion was deemed too dangerous. One could never know how much they brought back. “Tell me, please.” </p><p>“Remove your dress first,” I said. </p><p>Emma wasn’t the only one that stiffened at the order, but it was easy to silence Aria. Just a twist of her nipple, and I killed her argument with a gasp. Emma spoke. “What are you talking-” she said, only to be cut halfway with a wave of my hand, and a ball gag appeared in her mouth. I dispelled it a second later, but it gave the message. I had my magic, and I was strong enough to destroy both of them without even bothering. “I - I can’t,” she stammered. </p><p>“Really, you were rather enthusiastic when I woke up the last night,” I said, once again using the opportunity to reinforce the misdirection about her mental intrusion. I wanted her to believe that her mental invasion had been successful, which would mean that she still had the hopes of acquiring the Eternal Core. An empty hope, the best way to manipulate someone as idealistic as her. </p><p>“That’s - different,” she whispered, but even as she said so, her shoulders went down. </p><p>“Of course, it was different. The last night, you were trying to satisfy your inner whore. Now, you’re trying to save your precious Empire from a very dangerous crisis,” I explained lazily. “Look, either we play by my rules, or we don’t play,” I said lazily, using a magic trick to exude self-confidence. From her perspective, I had no concerns and no fears at the moment. To be fair, molesting the half-naked princess of the Empire was the perfect item to deliver that particular impression, especially when her face and tits were still covered with my cum. </p><p>Watching the dance of emotions on her face, starting from anger and outrage, only to suffer under the iron fist of the circumstances to land a furious acceptance. “Now, the dress,” I ordered her, the same tone I would have used when I was still the ruler of my domain and facing the entertainer of the night. Emma flinched, but that didn’t prevent her from reaching to the back of her dress, unzipping it. “Slowly,” I commented, even as I waved my hand lazily to conjure nice music. “Dance for me.” </p><p>“That’s too much,” she gasped. </p><p>I shrugged. “That’s your call, but if you impress me, there might be some benefits for you,” I suggested, dangling a nice piece of metaphorical carrot in front of her, making her eyes widen. Even without trying to read her mind, I could easily predict her thoughts. She was thinking about the memories she had watched, where the Valkyrie, the hero of the border, was debasing herself in my bedroom —and many other interesting locations— in order to get important intelligence about the movements of some dark factions, which solidified her place in the hierarchy. And since Emma saw that in my memories, it was much more convincing than anything I could say. </p><p>My happiness brought rewards. </p><p>I wasn’t surprised when Emma started to dance to the rhythm of my music —both literally and metaphorically— but the same couldn’t be said for the poor princess who was currently sitting on my lap, trying —and failing— to understand the sudden change of the situation. </p><p>“It shouldn’t be that surprising,” I whispered, but loud enough to be heard by Emma. “She’s making the same choice that you did, helping to mollify my mood so that I would be open to cooperation. Are you surprised to see that you’re not the only one that is willing to work hard to help your precious Empire?” </p><p>Aria failed to say anything even when her beautiful lips were parted, and when I stole a lingering kiss from her neck, it turned into a moan that was the perfect mixture of pleasure and shock, proving her lack of experience once more, as not only her body was very sensitive, but also she kept being surprised by the reactions of her own body. Meanwhile, Emma was delivering a beautiful dance as her dress slid lower, first revealing her flawless shoulders, tempting me to leave a bite mark to stain them, just like the countless marks I had left on Aria’s previously pristine breasts. </p><p>I kept one hand on Aria’s perky breasts, enjoying the sensation, while the other started to move down, soon reaching to the hem of her skirt. Only then my hand reversed direction, but with a major difference, it slid underneath her skirt, once again enjoying the texture of her naked skin, this time her soft yet supple thighs. The moan she let out was a masterpiece, but still, I liked Emma’s sudden flash of jealousy more. </p><p>A pearl of laughter tried to escape my mouth, but I suppressed it, not wanting to dispel the unique atmosphere. I couldn’t believe that Emma was still feeling jealousy under these circumstances, but maybe I shouldn’t be. After all, she was a part of Lancelot’s party from the beginning, with enough achievements to rival Lancelot himself, only to be pushed to the second seat after things calmed down, her spotlight stolen by the flawless and innocent Princess Aria, both in terms of status, and in terms of her love life. </p><p>And now, here she was, debasing herself in front of me, the feared Dark Lord, and even now, the princess had the spotlight. </p><p>I kept my attention mostly on Aria, caressing her inner thigh as I climbed up further and further, paying attention to the jealous redhead occasionally. It worked just like I had hoped, and her movements soon shed their mechanic reluctance, flashing with a renewed enthusiasm as she tried to prove herself. The dress slid lower and lower as she delivered a dance that would rival the concubines of an Emperor in terms of quality, making my shaft even harder. Aria flinched as she felt my shaft hardening under her ass, pressing against her distinctively. </p><p>Meanwhile, Emma’s dress slid even lower, revealing her corset fully. She had chosen to wear a black and red corset, perfectly combining with her crimson hair. Even more impressively, she was walking around the room, the way her hips shook apparent despite her bunched dress. Her dance was still amateurish, but it only made it sexier. Her body continued to sway as her dress slid down, until they finally ended up on the floor, revealing her beautiful legs, toned to perfection during the endless missions she took for the sake of the Light. She turned out to be wearing a pair of panties barely more than a thong, their lacy fabric giving a hint of the soft skin underneath. </p><p>“I removed my dress, now it’s your turn,” she said as she stood straight, in a belligerent pose. Or more accurately, it would have been a belligerent pose if she was still wearing a dress. In her underwear, when her hands crossed underneath her breasts, when combined with the effect of her corset, it created an amazing view of her cleavage. Her legs positioned aggressively, gave me a beautiful frontal view of her panties, including a hint of dampness that suggested I wasn’t the only one that enjoyed her dance. </p><p>“Oh, right,” I said even as I dragged my gaze over her body slowly, devouring every single detail until she started shuffling uncomfortably. Of course, during that, I didn’t neglect Aria. My fingers finally reached to her treasure, which was hidden by much thicker panties than Emma’s sexy piece, and started caressing, much to her shock. She stiffened of course, but the situation was far too overwhelming for her to react in a useful manner, especially as her body betrayed her. I felt significant wetness as I caressed her womanhood over her panties. </p><p>“Speak,” Emma ordered even as she tightened her arms, trying to look like she wasn’t affected by her half-naked state. I admired the attempt, which was decent for an amateur. Too bad that she was playing against a master of the craft.</p><p>“Mind your tone,” I said in a chilly tone, which contrasted greatly with the sensual music that was still playing in the background, and she took a step back. </p><p>“Sorry,” she murmured. </p><p>“Better,” I said as I leaned back, but intensified Aria’s special massage, both squeezing her breasts and caressing her entrance harder, finally overcoming her ability to contain herself. She started moaning loudly even as she closed her eyes in shame. “Now, I was about to offer you beautiful girls an interesting deal.” </p><p>“An alliance?” Emma asked, shocked. “With you? Impossible.” </p><p>“Alliance is a strong word,” I said. “Limited cooperation is a better classification. Since I’m going to stay in here foreseeable future, I’m sure that we can create a deal that makes both of us happy.” </p><p>“Why would you stay here?” Emma asked. “Why don’t you run away and take back your throne.” </p><p>I sighed. “A good question, but not one I will answer for free,” I commented, and before she could ask, I added. “Continue dancing.” Of course, she could have pointed out that removing her dress was already the payment for that explanation, but I was willing to bet that she had forgotten that small detail. </p><p>“You’re … You’re…” Emma murmured in shock, but I chose that moment to tease Aria’s clit, forcing an earth-shattering cry off her, interrupting Emma’s explanation. </p><p>“You need to be silent, sweetie, we’re talking,” I said to Aria even as I ripped her panties with one merciless pull, then stuffed them into her mouth. Aria tried to say something, but she was properly silenced. My fingers returned to her nether lips, finally touching her most sensitive spot naked. Aria moaned, once again muffled by her makeshift gag. </p><p>Only then I turned my gaze to Emma, who was watching the proceedings with wide eyes, no doubt shocked by the liberties I was taking with the princess of the Empire. To be frank, I was also a bit surprised by the ease I was taming Aria. I knew she was submissive, but not to this degree. “Dance,” I told Emma, and she did so. Her hips, finally free of the oppressive concealment of her dress, swayed to the steady beat of the music. </p><p>“Impress me,” I commented, and her hands ran up her hips, caressing her stomach and core. Her legs parted open, giving me a glimpse of her wet core as her underwear strained, then she bent down to enhance her cleavage even further. “Much better,” I said. </p><p>“You are supposed to explain why you’re still here despite your freedom,” she reminded testily, which did nothing to my good mood. To be fair, it was hard to hurt my good mood while I was enjoying a sexy dance show from one of the most important heroes of the Empire while simultaneously molesting the Princess of the said Empire like she was a bar wench. “How much do you know about the political structure between the different Dark Factions,” I said. </p><p>“Quite a bit,” she answered even as she turned her back and bent over, giving me an excellent view of her perky ass. “I spent most of my adult life fighting against them, after all.” </p><p>“True,” I said with a chuckle. “And you know that most of the factions are ruled by the ancient families, most prominently the Five,” I said, referring to the five major families that had the most resources between them. “Do you know which one I belong to?” </p><p>“None of them,” Emma answered immediately. “But the Five was once the Nine in the ancient times,” she added, including the four families had been destroyed in the hands of the Empire, or destroyed due to infighting several centuries ago. “Everyone knows that you’re from one of the lost four families, but we weren’t able to identify which one despite all of our efforts. You have revealed many ancient techniques from all those families.” </p><p>I chuckled. “I don’t belong to any of them, honey. I’m a commoner.” </p><p>“What- IMPOSSIBLE,” Emma exclaimed as she froze, but Aria was too far gone to even notice that, wiggling in my lap as I fingered her softly, blanketing her mind with pleasure. “But if that’s true, why didn’t your opponents used it, it would have helped them to weaken you?” </p><p>“Dancing, sweetie,” I said, reminding her that she was supposed to be giving me a delicious show. Upon reminder, she started shaking her body once more, making my mouth water greedily. Yes, I had a delicious blonde princess overcome with pleasure on my lap, but that didn’t prevent me from wanting to taste a feisty redhead, especially when she walked closer and pushed her hips forward, tempting me to lick a taste. </p><p>“About my commoner status, they didn’t reveal it, because they are long-term thinkers. They knew that even if they couldn’t take me down, I would eventually die, and it’ll go back to the beginning. Even if I can establish a dynasty, the Five would have become the Six, and that’s it. Much better than revealing everyone that a particularly strong and smart commoner can actually take and hold power, isn’t it?” I said, while Emma listened in shock, dancing automatically. </p><p>There was a benefit to her unconscious dancing, because her arousal and emotions took control, making her moves even more erotic. I played a bit with her by casting a spell to loosen her corset, and she didn’t even try to tie them, just using an arm to keep it in place. Still, it loosened enough to give me a delicious view of her areolas whenever she bent down, even showing her erect nipples occasionally. </p><p>“How does it tie back to you not escaping?” she added. </p><p>“Honey, the only reason I managed to hold power, because I managed to take the throne before the families could realize my true nature. But now that they’re aware, do you think they’ll sit back as I took back the power,” I explained. Which, admittedly, was not entirely correct. I could still plan several ways to take power, but funnily enough, most of them I could try from my cell even easier than outside. Not only it was actually safer here, but also my rivals were feeling safe without my presence, which would change if I actually escaped. </p><p>I didn’t tell Emma that, of course. It was for the best for her to think it was impossible for me to get back my title. </p><p>“So, you want to cooperate with us to get back your throne,” she said, her tone negative as she stopped dancing once more. </p><p>“Nothing so crass, sweetheart. I know you won’t do that, and I don’t want that either. But don’t stop dancing.” </p><p>“Okay,” she said as she started swaying once more. “Then, what do you want-” she started to ask, only to interrupted by Aria’s helpless moans —loud despite her makeshift gag— as she finally climaxed, which was even stronger than the previous ones, making her collapse against my body like a rag doll. </p><p>“We can discuss that,” I said, even as I tried to decide the payment for that particular talk… </p>",

    "content": "<p>After Lillian’s impressive reward, the rest of the journey had been rather unremarkable. Our escorts tried to make some noise about the unnecessary delay, but a garbage magical explanation was enough to resolve the subject, making them unable to answer due to a lack of knowledge. They weren’t happy about it, but they lacked the ability to respond, so the traveling together turned awkward. Not that I cared much about their opinion, of course. When the one that attacked me earlier woke up, he tried to create a crisis, but it didn’t last long. </p><p>The comfortable silence lasted until we reached the outskirts of a mountain that was radiating an impressive amount of magic. “This is Mount Pyrenaean,” Astrid explained when she noticed my interested gaze. “It’s the most spiritually-active mountains in the Eastern Gallic. It’s forbidden grounds for anyone other than the priestesses.” </p><p>“They seem to change their mind about its holiness,” I answered with a soft snort, although I didn’t blame them much. Religion might be important, but it tended to take second place to survival. Unless one was a fanatic, of course, but from Astrid’s descriptions, Matron Helena didn’t sound like a fanatic. I extended my magical senses to feel the precise nature of the mountains, only to be surprised. It might be the most magical place I had felt in my life, with a blanket of mana even thicker than the Halls of Saturn in Britanium where I received my magical education. </p><p>However, there was a reason that the Republic left such a magical place untouched, and that wasn’t just to respect the local religious beliefs —the Republic respected the local beliefs, but out of convenience rather than a true principle, and that respect never overwhelmed the needs of the Republic. The mountain was overwhelmingly magical, but it wasn’t the calm blanket of mana I had experienced back in the school, nor was it gentle turbulence of a magical fort. </p><p>No, the magic in the mountain churned like a storm, threatening to drown anyone foolish enough to step inside its confines. One mistake, and it would unleash its fury to an unsuspecting visitor. Before I could delve deeper into the sensation, the leader of the group stopped and pulled three blindfolds from his bag. “From now on, you’ll be wearing those,” he said in a matter-of-fact tone as he walked toward me. </p><p>It was an interesting request, especially since I could see him slowly getting excited at the prospect. It was a very interesting request considering the animosity between us. I doubted it was something without a reason. Curious, I extended my magical senses, and penetrated into the magical chaos of the mountains, something that would have been impossible before my Ascension. Even as a Sorcerer, it required me to expend a considerable effort. The mountain was truly formidable. </p><p>And the moment I penetrated the concealing effect, I felt a few dozen men waiting at the outskirts, and even their bloodlust was thick enough to be noticed even by my initial touch, through the interference of the mountains. Damn, I thought. Our supposed allies were even less reliable than I had initially assumed. </p><p>“No,” I said evenly as I looked at him, shocked at his request. </p><p>“What do you mean, no?” said the leader, shocked. </p><p>“No should be a simple enough answer,” I said in a deadpan tone. “We will not be wearing those, certainly not after one of your group had tried to assault us,” I added, pointing at the wounded man that was standing at the back of the formation, glaring at me angrily. “Do you really think that I would be stupid enough to let my security to your hands after that,” I said. </p><p>His expression of frustration would have been funny if the situation was any less lethal. “Out of the question. The safe route is about our security, and we can’t let a foreigner-” he tried, but I cut him off. </p><p>“Okay,” I said simply. </p><p>“Okay, what?” </p><p>“Okay, don’t bring us here. We will camp in the outskirts. Just send a message to our esteemed ‘allies’ to come down, so that we can have a talk.” </p><p>“You’re pushing your luck,” said the leader in a cold tone, gripping the hilt of his weapon tight, getting truly angry for the first time. “We’re already treating a useless whore who fashions herself as a holy woman and two Roman bastards better than you deserve. Who do you think to ask our leader to come down for a meeting.” </p><p>His sudden burst of anger, combined with the mystery assailants hiding behind the mountain’s magic, suggested that the reception that was waiting for me was even worse than I had first assumed. Damn it, I thought. It wasn’t enough that I had the pirates, legionaries, and a plethora of other riffraff following me, but also my supposed allies were much weaker than I had thought. </p><p>I considered turning back and running away, but one thing kept me in here. The mountain itself. It was clearly dangerous and hard to navigate, and while it was dangerous, at least I was strong enough to actually use my senses to penetrate through its chaotic mana field. Dangerous, but a much better option than actually trying to get away from my mysterious enemy by moving deeper into Republic territory. </p><p>“Take it or leave it,” I said dismissively, not even bothering to reach a weapon, instead of conjuring a crackling ball of purple energy, enough to radiate death. </p><p>His anger was apparent, but he stayed his hand. Instead, he turned and walked back to his group, and talked to one of them, sending him as a messenger. “Let’s rest for a moment,” I said to the girls, gesturing Astrid to stay silent. After we sit, I created a ward around us to prevent eavesdroppers. </p><p>“Something is wrong,” Astrid said immediately. “Matron Helena wouldn’t have sent them without a comprehensive set of orders. They weren’t supposed to need it.” </p><p>“They don’t,” I said even as I used my magic to follow the messenger, who just stopped after reaching the hidden group of assailants, a couple of hundred yards deep into the chaotic magical field. I also noticed that the messenger had a small crystal in hand, and stopping occasionally to check its reaction. “They have another team hidden behind the mountain’s concealment, and they are waiting for us to make a move.” </p><p>“An ambush?” Astrid asked in shock. “Something is really wrong with the Matron! Maybe she’s captured.” </p><p>“Maybe,” I said, not sharing Astrid’s confidence about Helena’s loyalty, especially when two random Romans were concerned. We hadn’t even officially met yet. She would have no complications using me as a disposable chip for her own schemes. </p><p>“Should we run away,” Lillian asked gloomily, her voice shivering. Her sudden drop in morale was understandable. She was a strong mage, but she wasn’t used to adversity, especially the kind we found ourselves in. The sudden turn of events when we were hoping for an ally doubtlessly affected her. </p><p>“No,” I said decisively. “If we run away, we’ll have another bunch of enemies behind us, and this time, they would be in breathing range. I don’t want to try ditching them when they have much superior command of the territory.” </p><p>“Then what are we going to do, follow them into the mountain?” Astrid asked incredulously, her tone suggesting just how much she was against the idea. </p><p>“Half-right,” I said. “We’re going to climb the mountain, just not follow them. I’m going to teach them the folly of trying to ambush a Sorcerer in a chaotic space of magic.” </p><p>“You can sense through the chaotic magic field,” Astrid commented in shock. “That was supposed to be impossible. No one had done that for centuries.” </p><p>“Sweetie,” I said with a chuckle even as I patted her head patronizingly, earning a slap to my shoulder. I chuckled. “At this point, you should be used to my miracles.” </p><p>Both girls chuckled, but before they could comment, the leader of the group walked toward us. I dispelled the ward. “I have received a message. The chief is allowing you to enter the holy mountain without blindfolds. But beware. If you ever tell anyone about the route, our tribe will make sure you’re sacrificed to the gods for that sacrilege.” </p><p>I had to admit, I was impressed. The concern for the future, backed by the threats, was a nice touch. If I hadn’t felt the team positioned for the ambush, I might have actually fallen for his deflection, trying to distract me from the present by focusing on the future. “That’s acceptable, let’s move,” I said, then turned to the girls, and whispered. “Hold hands, and don’t separate no matter what happens,” I said before turning my attention to the chaotic magic field. I had reasonable confidence in taking down the full ambush team, but that would have solidified them as an enemy, something I was reluctant to do. Moreover, even if we were destined to be enemies, that didn’t mean that they would suddenly be friends with the legionaries. The more warriors in the tribe, the longer the distraction they could create against a band of professional soldiers, maybe even inflicting some considerable damage in the process. </p><p>Not every surprise was a nasty one, as the moment I stepped onto the mountain, the chaotic magic enveloped my body comfortably, no different than a warm blanket as I tried to sleep. “Be careful, the steps are treacherous,” the leader warned me, even as the path he took was not the safe one. Instead, he was leading us to a dead-end, which was also surrounded by a few dozens of archers waiting for our appearance. An unexpected volley of arrows was one of the best ways to deal with a mage, just a bit behind the knife into the eye while the target was sleeping. </p><p>“Are you sure it’s the steps that are treacherous?” I said, unable to keep myself from quipping, even as I let my magic mingle with the mountain’s aura, deepening my connection. </p><p>“What?” he said, too distracted by the anticipation to catch my quip, even though it wasn’t something that could be categorized as subtle. And then, it was too late, because I triggered a small magical storm around me, the eye just large enough to contain three of us if we pressed our bodies together. </p><p>“You don’t need an excuse,” Lillian whispered as her arm wrapped around my waist and pushed her body tight in an effort to avoid the effect of the storm. Meanwhile, the group around us raised an alarm, a couple of them falling victim to the storm and suffering a horrible but rather quick death as the magically-charged winds destroyed their bodies, but in the grand scheme of things, their losses were negligible. The leader survived, but I was happy to note that the annoying guy who tried to attack us during the first meeting hadn’t. </p><p>“What’s going on,” they shouted while we slowly diverted our destination away from the safe path they had created for themselves, stepping into the wild flux of magic. Luckily, with the connection I felt with the magic of the mountain, creating a bubble of safety was trivial. </p><p>“What happened,” called someone from the ambush team as he dashed toward the leader of the diplomatic team —not that they did the word diplomatic any justice— his face contorted in alarm. I stayed near, curious about their reaction. </p><p>“A magical tornado hit us. A big one,” the leader said. “I was quick enough to escape, but even some of our guys had fallen. Those idiots never had a chance.” </p><p>“Fuck,” said the other one in shock. “The chief is going to kill us. That redheaded bitch was an important part of his plans. Now, he has to find another excuse to make a move,” he said. </p><p>“Why can’t we just kill the bitch and be done with it,” the leader of the group said. “I’m getting fed up with her sanctimonious attitude, like she had any right to rule.” </p><p>“We can’t, at least not while she still has some key followers among the priestesses. Or are you willing to create a path for us?” </p><p>The leader growled in annoyance, but they started walking away. “The leader is going to kill me,” he moaned to himself as he did so. </p><p>“Don’t worry,” the other one comforted. “You’re lucky that I was just in time to witness the situation. It was a freak occurrence, nothing you can do would have prevented it.”  </p><p>“I guess,” he answered and they disappeared into the confusing flux of the magical cloud around the mountain. Only after making sure they were away, I turned to the girls. </p><p>“I knew that the Matron was not a traitor,” Astrid gasped, the sudden relaxing in her tone suggesting that her conviction wasn’t as untouchable as she tried to portray, but I let it slide. </p><p>“Probably, but we need to find a temporary residence before we discuss politics,” I chided her, before I led them toward the peak of the mountain, with a wide berth between our ambushers and us. I didn’t have many hopes. Finding a cave would have been the best, but I didn’t want to fight against whatever native creature that made the place its home, not when a flare might alert them about my presence. </p><p>“That was unexpected,” I murmured half an hour later, when I suddenly found myself facing the ruins of a mid-sized town made of magical marble. It was clearly a rich place, considering the magically-charged marble had managed to survive after who knows how many centuries. </p><p>“I didn’t know there was an ancient town in Mount Pyrenaean,” Astrid murmured in shock. “How did we fail to notice its presence after centuries.” </p><p>“Simple,” I answered. “Exploring such a dangerous place requires both skill and power, and in the tribes, anyone that shows both of those attributes was too important to throw away.” </p><p>Then, I ignored the way the girls sighed and turned my attention to the ruins. Our new home for a foreseeable future. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I still had a raging boner as I pulled into the driveway to drop Penny. We had pulled inside the city borders before she could finish the job she started, forcing herself to rise the suspicious glances of the observers. I had to admit that it was a pointless gesture, especially since wearing a tight tank top without a bra while sitting on the passenger seat of a convertible already enabled a bunch of assumptions on any observer. Having her head buried on my lap wouldn’t have changed a lot, with the added benefit of hiding her face. Still, when she stopped giving me a blowjob once she started hearing the other cars, I didn’t push her for it. </p><p>It was a pity that I was too busy to leverage the empty house that was waiting for us, but I needed to process the photos I took to make sure they were up to the task. </p><p>“We’re here,” I said, but even as I said so, I noticed a movement on the second floor of the house. It was a familiar redheaded figure, peeking through a parted curtain. Madison, I realized with a smirk. Someone was skipping school. </p><p>Our eyes met as Penny tried to step out of the car, prepared to dash inside before the neighbors saw her. Pointless considering the driveway was reasonably concealed with the high fences and the trees, but the way she was dressed was not something she could handle. </p><p>Not without my intervention, of course. </p><p>“What’s the hurry,” I said even as I grabbed her waist, preventing her hasty retreat. I might have to be too busy to follow her into the house —knowing that leaving the place with all the temptations would have been too hard— but that didn’t mean I didn’t want to play with her for a bit before her departure, especially with Madison watching. </p><p>“Going to the house,” she answered, but her voice lacked the conviction, turning it into a question. </p><p>“Aren’t you forgetting something?” I asked her, with a suggestive smile on my face. </p><p>“Am I?” she answered with a trembling tone, even as a blush climbed up her neck. She might not be the brightest bulb, but that didn’t mean that she missed the playful undertone in my voice, especially after all the stuff we had done outside. </p><p>I let the silence linger for a moment, just to drive the impression deeper, before speaking. “You’re a bit absentminded today. You need to give back the clothes you borrowed, of course.”</p><p>“Right,” she said with a relaxed giggle. “Just wait a minute, I’ll be back immediately.” </p><p>She tried to leave the car, only to be stopped by my grip once more. “I’m afraid not. I’m in a hurry, so we don’t have time for you to go back into the house.” </p><p>“But-” she started, only to be interrupted by my finger pressing against her pouty lips, lips that were wrapped around my girth just moments ago. </p><p>“We don’t have time,” I repeated even as I pressed my other hand to her stomach before pushing upward with torturous slowness, contrasting my words greatly. Her eyes widened as she realized what I had been really asking for. She tried to speak, only to be interrupted by my finger again. “Hurry up, sweetheart, or I punish you.” </p><p>“I - I understand,” she stammered, unable to meet my gaze. I chuckled as she reached for the button of her tiny jean shorts, a good call considering it would have been harder for a passerby to see. Of course, that didn’t apply to Madison, who was watching us, wide-eyed. Understandable, as dressing slutty was one thing, getting completely naked in a driveway was something else. </p><p>“Can’t I keep the shirt,” Penny murmured as her shorts slid down her beautiful legs. “I’m afraid.” </p><p>“Hmm… I might agree to that, but only if you agree to pose for a private session of mine, no questions asked.” </p><p>“Okay,” she said immediately even as she hugged me in relief. Not one to miss such an opportunity, I wrapped one of my arms around her waist to keep her in place, while reached to her bottom with the free one, slipping two fingers into her entrance. “Ah-” she started, only for her words to fall wayside when I started fingering her rapidly, replaced by a moan. Penny buried her head to the nape of my neck, trying to suppress her moans, while I turned my attention above, responding to Madison’s shocked expression with a smirk. </p><p>A gasp escaped Penny’s mouth as I pushed back to her seat, using the better angle to pick up speed, and adding my thumb to the deal. “That’s too much,” she gasped even as I pushed her toward another climax. “Please, stop,” she moaned. </p><p>“Not unless you finish what you started,” I reminded her even as I freed my cock once more, already erect. “It’s a punishment for not finishing your task,” I reminded her.</p><p>“Here,” she asked, but when I nodded, she obediently leaned forward, angling her body so that I didn’t need to remove my fingers from her entrance. I pushed the other hand through her beautiful blonde hair, and forced her to deepthroat my shaft, closing my eyes to fully enjoy the sensation, her gags like a lullaby to my ears. </p><p>Even as I tested the elasticity of Penny’s throat, I didn’t neglect to pay attention to Madison. When she raised her phone, I shook my head warningly. Luckily, she followed my request, proving that my hold on her was a dash stronger than I presumed. Feeling playful, I gestured to her shirt, only for her to have a mischievous smile on her face. Still, didn’t waste much time before unbuttoning it, revealing the sexy bra underneath. </p><p>I pushed myself deeper into Penny’s throat while Madison’s hands disappeared below the window, hiding her actions from my sight, though with the way her body shook subtly, what she had been doing was obvious. Not that it surprised me. She was far too horny to miss such a prime material to enjoy herself. </p><p>Madison had a vindictive smile on her face even as she enjoyed the scene. Entertaining, but not surprising. It had been a while since I spent any time with Madison, but she seemed like a gal who would enjoy watching me playing with Penny, especially if I read their relationship correctly. The vindictive glee Penny had displayed when she busted us when we were playing an entertaining game of spin-the-bottle didn’t suggest an amicable interaction.</p><p>I had a feeling that a tied-down Penny and Madison with a paddle in her hand would be a scene to remember. </p><p>Watching the redhead that peeked up from the second floor to play with herself was fun, but unfortunately for her, not as fun as enjoying an aggressive deepthroat from a busty blonde who had already experienced a few too many orgasms in the last couple of hours to think straight. Despite the promise I had made, I grabbed the back of her shirt and tugged hard. The fragile fabric failed to resist my pull, ripping with an impressive sound, leaving her completely naked. </p><p>Penny tried to rise, only to fail spectacularly due to my tight grip. “Continue,” I ordered even as I pulled my hand from her entrance for a brief detour on her naked breasts, squeezing her nipples while pushing her head down, steadily climbing toward a climax. Madison finally pulled down her bra —after making sure the road was empty— to flash me with her perky tits, it managed to dwindle the remaining distance into nothing, and I exploded into Penny’s beautiful mouth once again. </p><p>“You promised,” she gasped as she wrapped one of her arms around her chest, which barely covered anything with her impressive size, using the other to balance herself as she coughed. </p><p>“Well, you were supposed to do it on your own, but I had to help,” I commented. Which was ridiculous as far as counter-arguments were concerned, but Penny was not in a position to make a point of it. “Don’t worry, I’m going to give you something from the trunk,” I said, but made no move to stand up. </p><p>“Hurry up,” she begged. </p><p>“Not before you finish, sweetie,” I answered. “Give me a show.” Her eyes widened in shock, which wasn’t helped when I raised my camera once more to take her pictures. </p><p>“Please,” she begged, but her plea might have been more effective if I hadn’t noticed the thick layer of arousal coloring her tone. She might be inexperienced before today, but under my tutelage, she was discovering the secrets of her body, which was making the situation rather delicious. Even more importantly, even as she begged, her fingers slipped inside her pussy, ramming inside with a speed that could only come from arousal. </p><p>“Much better,” I commented even as I took a photo, enjoying the sight of her leaning back as much as possible, which enhanced the view. “However, don’t neglect your beautiful tits,” I reminded her, and her fingers sink into the firm vastness of her bosom. I felt a bit disappointed that I didn’t have any toys with me, as I would have loved the sight of her trying to devour a full-sized mimicry while posing for me. </p><p>“I just want this to end quickly,” she commented in a surprising fervor that didn’t exactly fit her personality, but I let it slide, especially since her enjoyment was clear. After the number of times I pushed her out of her comfort zone today, it was only to be expected. I was tempted to order her to stop, just to extend her sweet torture a bit more, but I had already pushed her enough today, and I was afraid of overwhelming her. </p><p>“Then, be faster,” I recommended her even as leaned forward, taking a few close-up shots of her beautiful face, jumping between arousal and frustration. She growled in frustration, but that didn’t prevent her from following the advice, and quickening the dance of her fingers. “Glad to see you’re enjoying yourself,” I commented, earning another growly, one that turned into a desperate gasp as she climaxed a moment later, shivering desperately on my leather seat, tempting me for more. </p><p>Pity that I had to work. </p><p>With a sigh, I stepped out of the car and moved to the trunk to give her the clothes I promised. Meanwhile, Madison was still at the window, furiously fingering herself, clearly edging an explosion herself. I gestured her to be careful, as Penny was moving around, and she might notice Madison’s presence. Madison followed my suggestion, but only after raising her glistening finger to her lips and made a show of sucking them. </p><p>I pulled a small bag and put several sets of underwear and a couple of sexy clothes on it, before pulling a beautiful red bikini top. It was a skimpy thing that would look sexy even on someone with more normal proportions, and on Penny, I expected it to look downright obscene. “Here,” I said as I passed it to Penny, who had just finished putting her jean shorts back on. </p><p>She said nothing as she raised the bikini top against her chest, only to see it barely covered anything. Still, barely was leagues better than nothing, so she didn’t complain but quickly put it on. </p><p>I also passed the bag to her. “These are the clothes the company didn’t want back,” I explained. “It’s a nice perk of modeling.” </p><p>“Thanks,” she murmured, only to blush furiously as she opened the bag and checked its contents. </p><p>“I want you to send me selfies with every single one of them,” I commented. “To make you comfortable trying clothes,” I explained. She looked at me suspiciously, but still nodded. Then she stepped out of the car, an expression of realization blooming on her face, like she had just woken up from a dream. The reality of the situation hit her hard, leaving her a blushing mess. I could have pushed for more, but unfortunately, I actually had work to do. Instead, I watched as she mumbled a hurried farewell before dashing inside, her tits jumping impressively with each large step, the support of her bikini top negligible. </p><p>As I drove away, I was already planning for the next session, considering the relative merits of having a joint-session with Nicole… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Cornelia wasn’t in her room when I checked, so finding her took a bit of a search. On the way, I stopped by Aviada for a quickie, getting another instance for my mana regeneration and borrowing her sword again before I continued to search for Cornelia. Though Carla’s absence left me disappointed. Messing with her was fun.  </p><p>It didn’t take long to find Cornelia, I just needed to follow the flashes of light in the training grounds, contrasting greatly against the darkness of the evening sky. I didn’t make a sound as I sneaked in, not that it was difficult. After dark, not many students hung around the practice forest, and the ones that brave enough to do so had avoided Cornelia, who was throwing fire around copiously. And it was good that they avoided her, as it meant no one saw Cornelia laughing deliriously as she killed rabbits in droves.</p><p>For a moment, I stood hidden, enjoying the beautiful vision. Despite her slightly unhinged laughter, she was beautiful with her blushed face, a previously-unseen excitement dancing behind her beautiful green eyes. Her crimson hair fluttered wildly with the winds created by her flame magic, their shine lighting creating sharp shadows that highlighted the beautiful lines of her face. Her well-tailored crimson robe completed the vision, elevating her beauty to an ethereal level. </p><p>My maid was truly beautiful! </p><p>“You should leave some rabbits for the others,” I said, not bothering to restrain my laughter. Cornelia immediately turned to face me, and dashed forward the moment she recognized me. If it had been in the past, that scene would have scared me to death, but now, I was calm enough to notice the uncharacteristically huge, almost delirious, smile on her face. I would have doubted her for being drugged if I hadn’t known the reason. </p><p>“Caesar,” she gasped gleefully as she hugged me, burying her face to my neck, trembling in excitement. “I can gain experience again. Thank you, thank you, thank you…” she murmured repeatedly, and I felt the wetness of her tears even as she laughed uncontrollably. I had thought that I understood the stress she had been under, but it seemed that I had miscalculated if her candid reaction was any indicator. I would have suspected that a shapeshifter took her place if I didn’t have the ability to check her soul space. </p><p>“It’s nothing more than I had promised, my sweet maid,” I said with a chuckle, wanting to tease her a bit, but even the reminder of her obligation was unable to chip her cheer. She said nothing else, just kept hugging me, so I decided to enjoy the opportunity. A second was all I needed to sweep our surroundings to ensure there were no uninvited guests around, and another second to set up a three-layered ward to ensure our privacy. </p><p>The flare of magic was enough to make Cornelia raise her head. She closed her eyes, her mana reaching and touching the ward to examine, only to blush immediately. “Privacy wards?” she murmured shyly, and when I nodded, she managed to surprise me once more. She caught my lips in a searing kiss, the aggressive dance of her tongue conveying her enthusiasm. </p><p>“Someone is feeling eager,” I said with a smirk when she pulled back for a breather.</p><p>“S-shut up!” she stuttered with uncharacteristic shyness, avoiding my gaze as she blushed. Then, just to cover up her frustration, she slapped my arm hard. “I’m just paying you back for your services.” </p><p>“Of course,” I said, nodding sagely, feeling kind enough not to mention the way her fingers trembled with genuine excitement as she tried to unbutton my shirt, even accidentally ripping a couple of buttons in the process. I decided to follow her lead when she pushed me toward a small opening, covered with thick grass that was more comfortable than my old bed. I knew how comfortable it was, because Cornelia pushed me down until I was lying on my back, removing my shirt in the process, only to lay on top of me. </p><p>And just like that, we started a heated make-out session, her hands exploring the muscles on my chest continuously, like it was the first time we’re being together. In a sense, it was. The other times we were together, because Cornelia was driven crazy by my touch and my skills, but it was strictly physical. This time, she genuinely enjoyed my presence, awed and worshipful. Apparently, decisively solving a problem that was darkening her future was enough to break through her prickly exterior.</p><p>Initially, I was planning for a quick rump to test whether she could gain any experience through my unique method before bringing her along for a hunting trip, but her enthusiasm changed my mind for a bit. If she gained any experience at this moment, her focus would go to the possibilities of the moment, which would be a pity. I wanted to see what she would do while she had the lead. </p><p>The answer turned out to be quite a bit. At first, our bodies stayed locked together, deepening her kiss further even as her body writhed over mine desperately. She even managed to remove her robe hurriedly without stopping the kiss, once again causing the loss of a few buttons.  because when she pulled out of the kiss, she close to trace my chest muscles with her hands as she moved down with a purpose, her expression ravenous. </p><p>A desperate need was oozing off her when she reached to my belt, trying to remove it, only for her hands to tremble so bad that she fumbled again and again. “Enough,” she growled in beautiful anger, and burned the belt buckle, which also showed her precision. Fire magic was the most destructive of the elemental magics, and the hardest to control. The fact that she was able to burn off the buckle of my belt without burning my skin was definitely a credit to her skills, proving that my efforts to recruit her into my inner circle was not a waste… </p><p>However, when she pulled down my pants, happily running her hands over my naked thighs as she leaned down, I turned my focus to the present. Her lips closed around my shaft and her head bobbed aggressively. It was a beautiful, deliberate assault, made better by the fact that her beautiful emerald eyes stayed connected with mine, reflecting her arousal. Her loose shirt giving me an amazing view of cleavage whenever she reached the top, and her eyes watered whenever she took most of my shaft into her mouth. </p><p>I wanted to see her naked, but also, I wanted to show off. So, I decided to replicate the same trick with the belt, but on a wider scale. I took a deep breath as I collected my magic, and cast two spells simultaneously, fire magic to burn off her clothes, and an Arcana Shield magic to protect her skin, so that she wouldn’t even feel a flash of heat, followed by a wind spell to scatter the ashes before Cornelia could even register.  </p><p>[-52 Mana]</p><p>[Achievement: Dangerous Divesting. Safely undress a sexy vixen through a dangerous method. +3 Precision, +1000 Experience]</p><p>“W-what, how!” she stuttered in shock as she rose, displaying her beautiful perky tits fully in the process, only to meet with my smug smile. “Do you know how dangerous that-,” she started, only to stop halfway. “Fuck, I don’t care. I’m so turned on,” she corrected herself as she climbed to my lap, and skewered herself with my length, her cry echoing in the opening, only to be absorbed by the privacy spells, keeping our little play a secret. </p><p>I lay on my back, doing nothing other than enjoying the frantic ride. And frantic she was, her hips rocked hard as she moved up and down, her hair fluttering with her movement, her fingers digging into my chest. At that moment, she was a quintessential fire mage, her desire burning as bright as her spells. Just to make a beautiful moment even more perfect, a notification appeared in my sight. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 52%]</p><p>For a moment, I wondered why the latest display of strength had done something the others hadn’t done yet, but it occurred a moment later. The trick I had used to undress her was definitely nothing simple, showing great strength and precision with fire magic at the same time. I had pulled some tricks that convinced her about my strength before, but it was either pure power, or I was using other elements. It was the first time I had shown such an overwhelming ability in her chosen category. No wonder it triggered the next stage. </p><p>After a minute of frantic riding, she let out a frustrated growl as she grabbed my wrists before bringing them to her tits, inviting me to touch her body. Never one to reject such a kind offer, I sank my fingers to her perky tits, enjoying their firmness. She might not have the size to rival Helga or Marianne, but she was a step above them in firmness. The harder I squeezed, the louder she cried even as she rocked back and forth. </p><p>She trembled in excitement as I suddenly pulled my hands only to caress her tits softly, followed by a soft flick to her rock-hard nipple, the sudden change in pacing pushing her even deeper into the land of arousal. She collapsed forward and hugged my body, even though her hips continued their frantic motion. “Cum in me, my lord. Mark me hard with your seed, make me mine,” she whispered repeatedly, her eyes clouded with pleasure. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 57%]</p><p>“As you wish, my loyal maid,” I whispered back as I exploded inside her without a warning. And as a gift for her loyalty, I filled my seed with as much as mana as I could manage, practically emptying my reserves. </p><p>[-4320 Mana]</p><p>[Mana regeneration perk activated. Count 3. Duration, 8 hours]</p><p>She was already on the edge of a climax, and my own explosion was enough to trigger an orgasm. The rush of mana that filled her soul space, turning into experience under my control, completely overwhelmed her. She cried frantically as she closed her eyes, trying to stay conscious under the rush of pleasure, but failing greatly. Every tremor, every jolt of pleasure pushed her closer to the land of unconsciousness, making her slur like a drunk. </p><p>“That’s impossible,” she managed to whisper as she registered that she had indeed received enough experience to push her one-third to the next level, a task that would require at least a week of concentrated effort even for a noble family, along with great risk. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 61%]</p><p>“Nothing is impossible for me, my maid,” I whispered into her ear even as I caressed her head softly, letting her lay collapsed against my chest, her breathing slowly calming from its earlier frantic pace. I let her to sleep until my mana was full again, occasionally infusing some more mana to her soul space to observe changes, just to make sure there was no adverse reaction. Luckily, everything was in order. I wasn’t relishing the possibility of damaging her accidentally. </p><p>Also, I was happy to see her gain experience from my treatment, as she was currently Level fifteen, the highest one between my list of paramours, it allowed me to test the limits of my rapid-leveling assistance. I was curious where was the limit. Luckily, I was in the perfect position to explore that. I woke her after twenty minutes of rest, when my mana capacity was refreshed completely. </p><p>I kissed her gently even as I used a simple healing spell to wake her up. “Wake up, sleepy,” I murmured as her eyes fluttered open. </p><p>“I had a weird dream-” she murmured as her eyes stayed closed, only for them to jolt open a moment later. “No, I really gained more than four thousand points of experience. How!?” she gasped as she grabbed my face, shouting frantically. </p><p>“It’s just another trick from my bag of surprises, sweetie,” I said lazily, amused that even as she rose frantically, my shaft was still in her, moving deeper as she moved. </p><p>“That’s impossible,” she uttered in shock, though the seriousness of her expression flickered as a moan escaped her. </p><p>“Really?” I said even as I grabbed her waist before flipping suddenly, trapping her under me in a missionary position, my shaft still inside her. “Let’s see whether it’s impossible or not.” With that, I started impaling her furiously, each push clapping loudly to fill the opening, loud enough to cause a scandal if it wasn’t for the privacy wards, each pump accompanied by a mana dump. </p><p>[-650 Mana] </p><p>“That’s impossible,” she murmured again, this time her voice colored with worship rather than disbelief. “How?” </p><p>I had no intention to admit to her that I had no fucking idea, so I played it mysterious. “There’s still some time until you can learn my important secrets,” I whispered, suggesting that not only I knew why I could do what I was doing, but also it was more earth-shattering than my unique rapid-leveling assistance or raising the level cap. The expression of devotion, mixed with pleasure, showed that it was the correct approach. </p><p>Her legs wrapped around my waist, using her full strength to pull me deeper. As a mage, even her full Strength was not impressive, but I was a gentleman, so I followed her kind wishes, ramming inside her mercilessly, each push creating a mixture of pain and pleasure, accompanied by another injection of mana. She moaned deliriously, her fingers digging into my shoulders hard enough to draw blood. </p><p>[-6 HP]</p><p>[-2416 Mana]</p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 66%]</p><p>\"Yes! Oh, yes!\" Cornelia cried as she shuddered uncontrollably, drowning in pleasure. Her back arched, thrusting out her chest, so I brought my lips to catch her nipples, adding yet another layer to her pleasure. Then, just to make things more fun, I stood up, easily lifting her along me, and walked toward the nearest tree. I cast a biomancy spell to make her body sturdier before trapping her between my body and the tree, impaling her hard enough to violently shake the tree with each push. </p><p>The harder I fucked her, the louder her cries of pleasure become, enjoying my displays of power whether it was physical or magical. She was really turned on by power. Luckily, power was something I had in spades, so it wasn’t exactly a drawback. Her mouth found my shoulder, biting furiously as she shuddered with another explosive orgasm, the only reason she stayed conscious was my healing spell. </p><p>[-11 HP]</p><p>[-1328 Mana]</p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 71%]</p><p>I decided to change the pace and pulled out of her while simultaneously used the spells to prepare her puckered hole, only to slam mercilessly, forcing her to cry in pain, earning another merciless bite in response. However, that didn’t prevent her from crying with pleasure, and when I met with her eyes, I could read her total surrender in its depths. She smiled in ecstasy, the way she shuddered only making her sexier. And I liked it as well. Fucking the Flame Queen of Silver Spires on a featureless grassy patch mercilessly was a delicious experience, especially she showed the ability to take as hard as I could give —with a bit of magical assistance, of course.</p><p>“Harder, faster!” she cried. “Take me, use me, ruin me!” </p><p>And I did so, fucking her so hard that the only thing that prevented her death was the copious amount of healing magic I was casting continuously. Foreplay was a forgotten word, and gentleness was a lost concept. A furious lust and a desire to bend her to my will guided my actions, as I rammed, impaled, spanked, and bit, every single one meeting with an obedient gasp. She didn’t even argue when I tied her hands with conjured ropes made from Arcana energy, forcing her arms back, leaving her helpless against my assault. When I filled her backdoor, she just moaned obediently. </p><p>[-1721 Mana]</p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 75% - Third Stage Completed +15000 Exp]</p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Relationship not sufficient for the third stage]</p><p>[Skill Share perk activated.

It turned out not to be the case. A slight disappointment, but it faded against the pride and pleasure I was feeling. A small snag like that was nothing… </p><p>The next hour was filled with a merciless pounding that tested her limits both physically and mentally, but she managed to acquit herself perfectly. Even with her every hole was leaking, and her mind was turned into mush with pleasure, she moaned in joy, taking my shaft obediently… It took a bit longer than necessary to make her level up, because I was simultaneously reinforcing her soul space to increase her cap as well. After the first time, it was much more convenient. </p><p>“I leveled up,” she murmured dazedly before losing her consciousness once more, finally overcome with pleasure. Before she lost consciousness, I noticed that she had picked Master Arcana for her skill, rather than progressing to Legendary Fire Elemental, which was a decision I approved —though I wasn’t sure whether she received the option in the first place. Still, despite all the good news, I frowned because of the notification I received. </p><p>[Target Level too High! Unable to Grant Experience]</p><p>Her level was sixteen while mine was twenty-four, which meant a fifty percent difference, the same amount that prevented me from gaining a level before the level gap had grown too high and five levels of difference also started preventing me from gaining any experience. Pity, I thought, as I was hoping for a more lax limit.</p><p>Luckily, I was already planning to go hunting. A simple water spell cleaned her body, removing dirt and cum from her body while I picked up her robe, the rest of her clothes already burned to cinders. I could have stopped by to pick new clothes, but the idea of her accompanying me, wearing nothing but a robe, was too tempting to pass on, so I dressed her in her robe before leaving the school with an unconscious sexy redhead in a bridal hold. Even then, leaving the premises was as easy as breathing…</p><p>The school really needed to update its wards!</p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 24    Experience: 295400 / 300000 </p><p>Strength: 28    Charisma: 38</p><p>Precision: 24    Perception: 27</p><p>Agility: 25     Manipulation: 30</p><p>Speed: 23       Intelligence: 32</p><p>Endurance: 22      Wisdom: 33</p><p>HP: 2899 / 2928\tMana: 926 / 3840        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Expert Arcana [75/75]        </p><p>Expert Subterfuge [75/75]         </p><p>Basic Speech [25/25]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p>",

    "content": "<p>After leaving Oeyne, I swung by the library to check for Titania, but her absence continued. Helga was still busy with the documents I had pilfered from the necromancer base, and the rest of the girls were supposed to be in classes. And while it was tempting to pull them from their classes, I could visit them later on. I had a bigger issue. After the payment for my dagger, I was poor once again. </p><p>I needed to gather enough materials before Oeyne finished the dagger, which might even be tomorrow. Luckily, I already had two instances of mana regeneration active with still a decent duration left. After sneaking out of the school, I once again used the faux-elemental trick, and five minutes later, I was three hundred miles away from Silver Spires, facing the outskirts of a misty mountain. </p><p>I was at Mount Dread. </p><p>I had picked my destination carefully, because this place was famous for the constant mist that caused many travelers to get lost until their death. Therefore, not a lot of people chose to hunt here despite the potential richness both in terms of valuable monsters to hunt and the variety of magically-rich herbs and minerals. Like I had done before, I picked a cave and spend half an hour covering the place with a thick layer of wards, both with passive and active defenses, making sure I had a place to hide if things had gone too badly. Only then I started my hunt. </p><p>At first, I relied on my melee skill, curious just how much it would improve thanks to my new specialized skill. The answer turned out to be a lot. I was a good swordsman before, but the difference between the two states was incredible. The difference was more than the one between Expert and Master Melee, though it wasn’t as much as the difference between Advanced and Master Melee. Apparently, I had been underestimating the impact of the specialized skills, as well as just how much my stats helped to overcome the others. </p><p>Still, I was glad for my more generalized approach, as it fit my strategy perfectly. </p><p>After making sure my sword skills were up to par, I started using spells to quicken my work, which worked wonders. Creatures below Class fifteen didn’t even take a second to take down, while the ones reaching Class twenty took at most thirty seconds, and only because I wasn’t willing to reveal my trump cards against them. After three hours of intense hunting, I had managed to collect enough to craft my sword and pay Oeyne for her efforts, which was above my expectations. </p><p>Mount Dread was a good hunting destination, it seemed, unable to keep a proud smile from forming. It felt good, being strong enough to treat a place the others were afraid to step in as a personal hunting ground. </p><p>However, as I was returning to my cave, that smile suddenly turned into a frown. My sixth sense started tingling, suggesting that I was being watched. It wasn’t an intense feeling, and I wasn’t able to see anyone around, but that didn’t mean that I was going to neglect the sensation. However, I changed my mind about going back to my safe house for a rest and continued hunting while underplaying my abilities, acting unaware of the foreign presence, hoping to bait them into an attack. </p><p>[+1 Subterfuge]</p><p>I barely kept back my flinch at the notification, which effectively confirmed that I had been being watched. However, as time passed, I started to discern more about my observer, including the fact that their gaze lacked the hostile intent. While that deduction was by no means foolproof, it was enough to make me relax a bit. I stayed in the mountain for another hour, relying mostly on my sword skills to hunt, supported by simpler spells with limited mana consumption. I didn’t want to alert my observer about my insane mana regeneration, which was still my most important trump card.</p><p>[+7 Subterfuge] </p><p>Seeing my subterfuge skill slowly increasing was convenient, both for the sake of progress, and informing me that I was still being watched. Still, I have left Mount Dread after the mana regeneration from Helga expired. I still had around half an hour for Aviada’s, which was enough insurance, but I wanted to be halfway back when that expired. Even with a full mana pool, I didn’t want to stick around against my mystery observer. </p><p>The sensation of being watched had disappeared when I left the outskirts of the mountain, but I maintained a slower pace for another fifteen minutes before I finally summoned the fake air elemental and returned to the school.</p><p>“Finally,” I said, feeling happy. Not just because I was carrying enough valuables to make a minor noble house jealous, but also I somehow managed to get away without finding myself embroidered in a fresh mess. </p><p>I stopped in my room to drop the loot, only to see Helga sleeping, exhausted. Pity, I thought as I checked the library, only to see that Titania is yet to be back. “Where did she disappear?” I murmured, unable to help but worry. She was strong, yes, but that hardly meant that she was invincible. She should be alert enough to avoid another ambush, but it wasn’t impossible. Regardless, if her absence continued, I would be forced to talk to the headmistress directly, which was something I wanted to avoid. </p><p>However, if avoiding that wasn’t an option, I wanted my subterfuge skill to be progressed to its new limit before doing so, just as an added precaution. Luckily, I had a good target for that. </p><p>I once again dressed as a servant and went to the Hall of Crafting, doing my best to penetrate the private locations of the various Guilds. I spent four hours in the attempts, and surprisingly, made very little progress. Apparently, the Guilds defended themselves much more meticulously than the school itself. I failed to penetrate their inner sanctums, but I managed to slip into servant areas for the Blacksmiths, Alchemists, and Enchanters, enough to swipe several apprentice-level books, while maximizing my Subterfuge in the process. </p><p>[+13 Subterfuge]</p><p>However, as I did so, I was able to listen to the gossip, even managing to convince some apprentices to have some idle chat. As a result, I learned quite a bit about Oeyne’s situation. </p><p>It turned out that she was originally from a famous Blacksmith family which held an important role in Blacksmiths Guild, but she belonged to one of the less important branches, so the family didn’t allow her to access their unique techniques, making her leave the family and join an adventurer group, which turned out to be highly successful, which wasn’t surprising as she had managed to reach level twenty-four. </p><p>The problem came when she rejected her family’s request to join back and take a role. Angry, the family had used the Guild to pressure her, only for her to resign from the Guild, which happened five years ago. Normally, it would have ruined her career, but she apparently managed to get herself a spot in Silver Spires, bypassing the school completely. </p><p>That was supposed to be the end of it, but for some reason, about a year ago, Enchanters Guild decided to join Blacksmiths Guild to suppress her, which was shocking enough considering the cold relationship between them. Even more surprisingly, about six months ago, the Alchemists Guild and Herbalists Guild joined them to exert pressure, which was something even her mysterious backers were unable to handle, which resulted in her losing her workshop. She apparently bypassed that by moving to the storage unit, but it was clearly a temporary measure. </p><p>Interesting, I murmured, curious why the hell four Guilds suddenly decided to suppress one independent Blacksmith, especially when they should be more than happy about the struggle of Blacksmiths Guild. In the end, I shrugged and left the Hall of Crafting, happy with my findings. Not only I had learned quite a bit about my latest target, but also I managed to maximize my Subterfuge. </p><p>I wanted to go hunting once more, but not before I activated my mana regeneration perk. I could have made a quick stop at Aviada, but after a brief consideration, I decided to drop by Marianne, curious about her progress. Then, I could swing by Cornelia, and pick her for the hunting trip, impressing her while helping her to level up again. Showing some of my capabilities in a nighttime hunt would impress her further about my capabilities, removing the last probability of a dissent. </p><p>After all the times I had been there, sneaking into Marianne’s room was not even a challenge. I found her sitting on her desk, several books open in front of her, a concentrated expression on her face. However, my attention was grabbed by the flickering dot of energy hovering above her hand. It was the anti-undead pure life energy. Impressive, I thought. The spell might be still far away from the combat applications, but she had succeeded in using it, and she did so in less than a day. No wonder she was a renowned healer despite her age. </p><p>That achievement deserved a celebration, I decided even as sneaked to her, and without a warning, pushed her on her desk. Conveniently, she was wearing a nightie, so I easily pushed it up as she cried in shock. Only then she realized the identity of her assailant. “Caesar,” she gasped in shock while I was busy pulling her panties down. “You scared me!” </p><p>“Sorry sweetie,” I answered even as I cast a spell to clean and lubricate her back door, pressing my shaft against her puckered hole. </p><p>“Caesar! What are you doing!” she exclaimed again when she felt my shaft, unable to process the sudden change of the situation. Not surprising, since she was really bad at processing change. </p><p>“Rewarding you for your progress,” I answered even as I pushed deeper, parting her puckered hole parting to accommodate the crown of my shaft. She gasped in pain as her body tried to adapt, but she made no move to avoid the pressure, obediently laying on her desk. It had been a while since our fateful encounter in the storage room, where she had surrendered her anal virginity while suffering from delirious arousal after my massage. And she had come a long way. </p><p>That time, she had accepted my presence resentfully —not only toward me, but also toward the betrayal of her own body. This time, after the initial shock wore off, she responded to my presence with an explosive moan of acceptance, even lifting her bountiful ass to give me a better angle. Her previous shyness didn’t seem to be preventing her from moaning. </p><p>“So, you managed to make great progress with the spell,” I commented absentmindedly even as I pushed my presence deeper bit by bit, using the assistance of my magic to loosen her, but not to the point of completely removing the sting of pain. Marianne clearly enjoyed a subtle jolt of pain, she wouldn’t have reacted to my anal intrusion with that much enthusiasm otherwise. </p><p>“The spell?” she stammered in shock, surprised by the topic of conversation I picked while I was fucking her anally. </p><p>“Yes, the spell,” I said even as I used the opportunity to slip some mana inside her, and her eyes widened with the rush of experience, which also triggered pleasure along with it. “Unless you want to stop and talk about it,” I added, giving her a nice ultimatum. I had no intention of leaving the discussion after sex. </p><p>[-614 Mana]</p><p>“But-” she started, only to receive a warning slap to her ass. I might have thought about actually pulling out and denying her the pleasure if the target was Cornelia, but Marianne was just too cute to torture like that. “Okay,” she moaned. “I managed to isolate the pure effect you have taught me,” she started explaining as I pushed deeper, enjoying the unique tightness of her forbidden hole. </p><p>“How long you can keep a fragment stable,” I asked even as I put my hand on her body, and pulled her nightie off her body, the fabric falling into pieces under my physical strength, leaving her plump body naked. </p><p>“Almost a minute,” she gasped while my hands scaled the familiar curves of her body once more, enjoying the curves. </p><p>“Very good. Show me,” I said even as I dumped another generous dash of mana inside her, but this time, I didn’t let all of it to convert to experience. Some, I maintained in her soul space to observe, while I let some in reserve, to mix with her mana as she cast the spell. I wanted to test whether I could guide her in casting directly. </p><p>[-873 Mana]</p><p>“Right now?” she asked, only to receive another spank on her bottom, which raised another cry of pleasure. She said nothing else as she raised her hand, and a small, flickering light appeared on her palm, which was less stable than the one I saw while she was on her desk. It barely survived a second. </p><p>“Again,” I said even as I slammed deeper into her, her body shivering under my touch as my fingers found her breasts. I was happy to note that rather than trying to make excuses, she just cast another spell, which managed to survive for three whole seconds. “Again,” I repeated, but this time, I let my mana to infect her spell after she cast, keeping the structure stable even as her attention wavered. “Watch carefully,” I warned as I took partial control of the spell, letting it grow while stabilizing it simultaneously, until it was as large as an orange. </p><p>“Amazing,” she murmured, which followed by a moan as I slammed even deeper. By taking the control of the spell, I had allowed her to observe my casting directly, which naturally provided her with a lot of insight. I let the spell to disperse and she raised her hand immediately, casting yet another spell. It was brighter than her previous spells, and even then it managed to stay stable for fifteen seconds before it risked dispersing. I repeated the same trick, stabilizing it as I made it grow, allowing her to observe it directly with her mana. </p><p>We repeated the process several times, and we continued to have fun in the process. Of course, in our interesting tutoring session, my hands continued to explore her body while I continued to impale her puckered hole, her moans getting louder and louder. However, despite her fraying control, her spells continued to shine brighter and survive longer, though her spell fell in pieces when I finally climaxed, bringing her along in the journey. </p><p>[Mana regeneration perk activated. Duration, 8 hours]</p><p>“Not bad, but you need to be able to maintain control in your spells,” I warned her as I pulled out. </p><p>“I’ll make a note, sir,” she murmured playfully even as she tried to break through the haze of orgasm. I held her hand and helped her to stand up, helping her to walk. She hooked her arm around mine, and we might have been mistaken for a proper noble couple if it wasn’t for her naked state, and my seed slowly dripping out of her puckered hole. </p><p>We said nothing until we arrived at the bed, and she lay down, her legs parted invitingly. Not one to miss such a kind host, I took my place between her legs. “Now, it’s time for your final test,” I murmured into her ear as I slipped into her womanhood. “Keep the spell active until I climax, and I’ll give you a reward.” </p><p>She said nothing, but her blue eyes shone with a hint of a challenge as she raised her finger, her eyes reflecting the light of the spell. I leaned down, my lips gently pressing against her slender neck, building a road from my kisses, leaving toward her impressive bosom. Seeing that the light of her spell was stable, I decided to increase the challenge. I continued to slide inside her gently, but my lips started to act aggressively, leaving hickeys and bite marks on her neck before they arrived at their final destination. </p><p>She moaned louder as I nibbled her skin, but she started to dance more enthusiastically, tempting me to pump her furiously. Instead, I took her with soft, gentle beats, increasing her moans as I explored her depths. As I did so, I filled her more of my mana, pushing her closer to Level thirteen, but didn’t let her complete yet. It was the reward for her success, after all. Since we were in her room, she abandoned her sense of control, moans echoing off the walls. Still, she somehow managed to maintain control of the spell, showing the effectiveness of my new teaching method. </p><p>I licked, nibbled, and caressed her body while I maintained a steady pace of pumping. Fifteen minutes later, she turned into a delirious husk of moans and cries, barely holding the spell under control. I decided to take mercy, and when I felt I was about to explode again, I didn’t bother to resist the call, exploding inside her. And since she was able to keep the spell stable, I infused my seed with a generous amount of mana, making her trigger. As I did so, a notification surprised me.  </p><p>[-2164 Mana]</p><p>[Achievement: Talented Tutor. Bring a pupil to new heights through unconventional methods of teaching. +2 Intelligence, +500 Experience]</p><p>“I got a level,” Marianne murmured, which was barely above a whisper. I let her lack of reaction slide, as while she was clearly excited, trying to keep the spell active for the duration of our beautiful embrace, all under a continuous rush of pleasure, took a lot from her, and she was tethering on the edge of unconsciousness. Luckily, she was already in her bed. </p><p>“I know, honey. Now, sleep,” I whispered even as I placed a gentle kiss on her lips. She was already asleep before I could finish pulling the covers on her. I chuckled as I fixed my clothing, leaving her to her rest. </p><p>The next stop, Cornelia. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 24    Experience: 279400 / 300000 </p><p>Strength: 28    Charisma: 38</p><p>Precision: 21    Perception: 27</p><p>Agility: 25     Manipulation: 30</p><p>Speed: 23       Intelligence: 32</p><p>Endurance: 22      Wisdom: 33</p><p>HP: 2856 / 2856\tMana: 1721 / 3840        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Expert Arcana [75/75]        </p><p>Expert Subterfuge [75/75]         </p><p>Basic Speech [25/25]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p>",

    "content": "<p>It had been a while since Aria’s arrival, and the prudent thing to do was to stop. </p><p>That strategy had one problem. The sight of Aria’s half-naked body —covered in my cum, collapsed on the floor as she tried to process the second orgasm of her life, one that came minutes after the first— was far too tempting to resist, especially when she was confused enough to listen to my orders. How could I call myself a Dark Lord if I turned my back to the opportunity to corrupt an innocent princess even further? So, I established an alert ward —one that was weak enough not to be noticed unless someone was actively searching for it. On the negative side, it barely caused a mental tingling sensation when triggered, but that would be enough for me to act quick enough to prevent us from being caught. </p><p>Luckily, Aria was far too focused on the aftershocks of her orgasm to notice the spell. “That was excellent, Aria,” I spoke gently, only to continue with a sharper tone. “Now, we’re going to move to the next part of our lesson to make sure you have the ability to reawaken a cock after a climax. Lean down and capture the head between your lips.” </p><p>Even in her confused obedience, my words were enough to make her stumble. “That’s - that’s too much!” she exclaimed in shock, trying to stand up, but her trembling body betraying her, keeping her on her knees. </p><p>“Really, that’s the part you are balking after everything,” I commented lazily, not bothering to hide my derision as I gazed at her tits pointedly, which was covered with my bite marks, my seed dripping down her chin, only to end on the beautiful expanse of her bosom. She flinched in shock, and I shrugged dismissively. “If you want to fail at your education despite already sacrificing this much, that’s your call,” I added for good measure, doing my best to sound like a supremely disappointed teacher facing a previously-favorite pupil, similar to the tone Queen Sapphire used against her whenever she tried to convince Aria quickly. </p><p>Her eyes widened in shock, confirming my guesses. She had a fragile personality, and while the Queen used to break her resistance. I also had no doubt that Aria was always under the protection of the Queen, who was far too shrewd to let others manipulate her heir —mostly because it would reflect badly at her authority— so Aria must be unused to hear the same tone in others. So, when used that particular tone, I was echoing the authority of the Queen, one that Aria obeyed for her whole life whether it was for political or personal matters. It wasn’t an invincible strategy, as there was a reason I hadn’t tested this trick before. Only in her already flickering and confusing state, such a tactic had any hope to work. </p><p>“No, I’m sorry!” she stammered immediately as she leaned forward, putting her hands on my thighs, which made her stained tits dangle forward, tempting me to unlock my chains and enjoy her fully, but I kept that part back. There was no reason to change the game when was this close to a victory. </p><p>“Your words mean nothing,” I said, my tone still disappointed. “Show me your remorse by respecting my teachings.” She nodded reflexively, as that was a reasonable statement. The next one, not so much. “Now, lean down, capture my cock between your lips, and start sucking,” I ordered. </p><p>Her eyes widened, and for a moment, I was sure that I had pushed too far, and she was going to run away. She even tried to rise on her trembling legs, but she collapsed when she met with my disappointed eyes. Her hands found my thighs once more, but this time, she used them for support as she leaned forward. She did so with a shocked expression on her face, one that reminded me of a drunk person despite knowing she was stone-cold sober. She closed her eyes as she leaned further, hiding the panic and shock dancing in their blue depths. </p><p>Then, I felt her lips around my shaft. </p><p>I watched as her mouth easily swallowed my currently-soft shaft, but as I felt her tongue touching my skin, that situation was quick to change. My manhood returned to life at a surprising speed, making it harder and harder for her to keep swallowing. She moaned in shock when it got too big for her to contain, gasping as she watched its growth. “So quick,” she murmured in shock. </p><p>“Only because of your immense skill,” I quickly said, once again playing the proud teacher. “It’s an excellent start,” I said. </p><p>“Start-” she commented, alarmed, only to be silenced with a gaze and immediately lowered her head once more, her lips once again closing around my girth. This time, however, it wasn’t as easy as before, the girth of my shaft large enough to cause her problems. </p><p>Even as I watched her struggle with my size —and occasionally giving her suggestions on how to achieve her aims— I considered my success. Looking at her, I truly understood Sapphire’s decision to marry her off to Lancelot, as the ease she was being manipulated had bordered ridiculous. Yes, I was a Dark Lord with significant experience in convincing people to forsake their morals for immediate benefits, but I achieved that through a wide array of rewards, bribes, implied threats, blackmails, all reinforced further by the overwhelming presence of my Dark Throne and my deadly retainers. </p><p>For Aria, all it took was a few underhanded comments about the threat represented by the other girls, and a few words to convey my disappointment was all it took to make her suck me obediently. She was so easy to manipulate, something I had all the intention of using to the limit. “Now, pull out, and give it a lick across its length.” Her eyes popped open on my command, but her shock didn’t prevent her from following my order. “Bring your left hand to my balls, and massage gently, and wrap your right hand around the base of my shaft.” </p><p>“Like that,” she whispered after she completed her lick, but before returning to sucking my shaft. </p><p>“Exactly,” I said to her, approving her move. “Now, go back to sucking,” I said. Her warm lips sunk over the head of my cock once again while her hands continued the tasks I had assigned, and a lightning bolt of pure pleasure passed through my body. She might be inexperienced and weak, but she was very quick to learn. Even better, after the initial hurdle was passed, she was quick to follow orders, no matter how much they made her blush. She was like a dam, flowing freely once her moral barrier was breached. </p><p>And I wanted to enjoy the uncontrolled flow as much as possible. “Try to add some tongue,” I ordered. She pulled out again, about to give a lick. “Not like that, keep your lips around my girth, but as you move your head back and forth, use your tongue to massage the crown.” She did so without saying anything, delivering a performance above my expectations considering it was the first time she did remotely similar. </p><p>After a few small corrections, I stopped speaking, watching as her head bobbed around my length. I was rock hard, which wasn’t surprising as I had gone through a long dry spell, and the delicious experiences of the last two days were far from enough to quench my thirst. She didn’t even notice that I stopped speaking, as her shyness had soon turned into utter concentration, her pouty lips continuing to caress my sensitive skin. </p><p>Her cheeks stretched lewdly whenever she lowered herself to halfway mark, temping me to release my hands and push her down to test whether the tight grip of her throat was pleasurable enough to touch her lips. To make things even better, her tits pressed against my thighs every time she lowered herself, and giving me a glimpse into their beautiful expanse whenever she rose, making the scene visually appealing as well as arousing. She was slowly losing her reticence, and picking up speed. </p><p>“The next stage,” I murmured, unable to reject the temptation to push it further. “Keep your eyes open, and look at me.” She tried to pull out. “I didn’t say stop,” I reminded her, and she froze, her lips still around my girth. Her eyes fluttered open, and met my gaze, their blue expanse trembling in shock. However, I maintained a firm expression, not willing to compromise. I didn’t want her fantasizing about someone else, but focus on the fact that her lips were around my shaft. “Now, start moving,” I ordered, and her head bobbed once again, but this time, our eyes stayed connected, allowing me to watch her chaotic emotions, mainly cycling between shock, excitement, shyness, and arousal. </p><p>It was a beautiful moment, especially since she was steadily climbing toward an orgasm alongside me. </p><p>Then, the door opened without a warning, freezing everyone, well everyone except me, but my response was automatic as I flared my magic and freed myself from the chains, giving me complete access to my powers, ready to blast our surprise visitor. Aria froze around my shaft as well, too shocked to even pull out. </p><p>It took me a second to register the identity of the intruder, as I was busy cursing myself about missing the ward being triggered, cursing my lack of attention. Yes, Aria was innocently sexy and surprisingly good at blowjob, but that shouldn’t have distracted me enough to miss that. Only when I realized the intruder had a familiar crimson hair, I relaxed a bit, my mind already churning a plan to twist the situation based on the findings of my evening incursion. </p><p>I made eye contact with Aria for a fleeting second, which was enough to send a mental message to her. “Just follow my lead and I’ll handle the situation. Trust me,” said the mental message, but I didn’t wait for Aria to respond —not knowing whether she had the skill to respond in the same manner. Every second was precious. </p><p>With my free hands, I could have cast a spell to slam Emma against the wall, or even kill her, then take Aria as a hostage. Though, I had a sinking feeling that Queen Sapphire would have loved the opportunity to show her dedication to the country by letting me kill her, ensuring the loyalty of the citizens through tragedy. No, I had a better way to handle the situation. </p><p>So, instead of casting deadly spells, I grabbed Aria’s head with both hands and pushed down, forcing her to swallow my whole length, and while Aria gagged and wheezed at the sudden intrusion, I turned my attention to Emma. “Oh, hello, Emma,” I said lazily, like I wasn’t throat-fucking the heir to the throne in front of a loyal —or at least, supposedly loyal, as the last night had put a question mark in that particular detail— mage of the throne. </p><p>Emma watched us with wide eyes, too shocked even to cast a spell. “What the - hell!” she stammered, starting with a whisper and ending with a shout. Luckily, she had already stepped inside, so it was trivial to cast a telekinesis spell to close the door behind her, preventing her voice from echoing in the secret tunnels. </p><p>“Why don’t you take a seat,” I said even as I waved my hand lazily, and the only chair in the room slowly flew toward her, while Emma watched in shock. She raised her hands, ready to cast a spell, but I shook my head slightly even as my expression hardened to the same expression I wore while I delivered a horrible assault against their party the day they had fought against me. That stalled her for a second, and used that time to reach to her mind and awaken a sense of hopelessness, the same kind she felt that day. Inside, I wanted to gloat, as it was the way the mind magics were supposed to be used, not the clumsy way she tried to subject me the last night. </p><p>“W-what’s going on?” she stammered again, this time in a whisper, the emotional trigger awakening her memories of the fight, a fight that they had to attack me with the full strength of their party as well as the assistance of several traitors to take me down. Alone, she had no chance. </p><p>“Sit down,” I repeated, my tone cold, even as I pushed Aria even deeper, enjoying the way her throat wrapped around my shaft. Speaking with such a menacing expression was hard, as Aria’s presence was steadily pushing me toward an orgasm. Luckily, Emma was not in a mood to carefully measure my expression. </p><p>This time, Emma sat down woodenly, unable to suppress her shock. “What’s going on?” she repeated again, this time in a whisper as she tried to understand what was going on, her gaze darting between Aria —who was doing her best to breathe with my cock lodged— and me, who was sitting on the floor, without the chains to keep me imprisoned. </p><p>“Simple,” I drawled lazily. “You have fucked up big time, and this poor Princess here has volunteered to sacrifice her dignity just to remedy a part of it.” </p><p>“I fucked up?” she whispered, confused. </p><p>“Yes, you fucked up,” I said lazily. “Or was it another stupid redheaded whore that woke me up by giving me a blowjob while insulting me at the same time, too distracted by her own burning pussy to properly lock my chains?” I explained smugly. Of course, I misdirected her by suggesting that I was still unconscious during her mental intrusion, not willing to reveal all of my cards at the same time. I could always use that detail in the future. </p><p>I let my gaze down to check Aria’s reaction, but luckily, she was far too gone to actually process our words, her own shock and the forced deepthroat in tandem enough to temporarily destroy her ability to eavesdrop. I kept one had on her head, forcing her deep enough to bury her nose into my pubes, while the other found her breast, finally sinking into their vast expanse, enjoying their firmness, finally filling a desire. </p><p>“But - no!” she gasped, shock and horror filling her face as the enormity of her failure hit her. She stood frozen, trying to process, while I continued to pump into Aria’s throat. </p><p>“Oh, yes,” I said smugly. “I had no idea you were horny enough to molest a sleeping man, though, so it was a surprise. Why did you unlock my chains, though? Did you used my fingers for some nefarious purpose as well?” I commented, amusing by the way her horror transformed from an existential threat to personal shame, helped by the fact that I was yet to attack her. </p><p>I was about to mock her a bit more when I felt my cock throbbing. I didn’t try to keep myself back, but let Aria rise for a moment, allowing her to take a deep breath before I exploded in her mouth, filling her with my seed. “Try to swallow, honey,” I said to her. “Maybe you can have a better chance than Emma here. The last night, she failed rather spectacularly when she tried to swallow,” I commented even as I kept Aria in place, who, surprisingly, actually followed that order and collected my seed in her mouth, and swallowed. Some of it slipped off her mouth, but it was an incredible achievement for the first attempt, especially under the circumstances. </p><p>“Bastard,” Emma murmured in shock, her face red enough to match her face as my comment reminded her of the way her face was covered by a load of my seed. </p><p>I just shrugged, smirking amusedly as Aria rose, trembling and coughing, stained in cum, trying to catch her breath… </p><p>“Now,” I murmured lazily, but the girls tensed regardless. Understandable, as one didn’t stop fearing a tiger just because the tiger was loaming lazily… </p><p>The most dangerous phase was complete, and despite the ridiculousness of the situation, I managed to dissuade them from attacking or attempting to retreat, all without sacrificing anything in my negotiating position. However, I needed to decide how to handle this, and I needed to decide it quickly! </p>",

    "content": "<p>When my alarm rang, waking me up from a pleasant dream, I was covered with sweat. Anna’s naughty adventure had been enjoyable, but also it sent my imagination overdrive. With a sigh, I woke up, and pulled open the curtains that were responsible for separating my bed from the rest of the RV, only to realize I wasn’t the only person that was awakened by the alarm. </p><p>Anna lay silent, her eyes wide as she looked at my naked body, panic, and arousal mixed together. I kept my eyes half-closed as I stumbled to the bathroom, acting like I hadn’t noticed her gaze. </p><p>In the bathroom, I once again left the door cracked open, but this time, she stayed away, probably because afraid of the risks. Explaining her presence next to the bathroom door while I showered was even more difficult when she was faking sleep, after all. </p><p>When I finished my shower, she was facing the other way, so stiff that almost trembling. I let out a silent snort as I left the bathroom with a small towel around my waist, then quickly dressed. Since this time my curious pervert was too afraid to peek this time, I dressed quickly —which wasn’t surprising considering I just pulled a pair of shorts and slippers and nothing else apart from my boxers. </p><p>I picked my notebook, a charcoal pencil, and stepped outside. </p><p>Once outside, I took a deep breath enjoying the crisp morning air. It was a bit chilly in the morning, but that was what I needed to awake completely and focus on the task at hand rather than imagining ways to mess with my shy blonde visitor. This trip had a point, after all. </p><p>I walked deeper into the woods, enjoying the way the small rocks shifted under my feet, helping me to focus on the environment. Then, I took a seat on a conveniently-broken trunk of a cedar tree, turning my attention on the shifting shadows of the trees, trying to ignore the small voice in the back of my head that was telling that I was nothing more than a struggling wannabe, a voice that was suspiciously familiar to my father’s. After all, after growing up hearing nothing more than how I was a lost cause that wasn’t going to amount to anything. </p><p>A self-inflicted slap to my cheek later, I turned my attention to the slowly-emerging creatures in the morning, my charcoal pen dancing on the paper, catching sketch after sketch, haphazardly shadowed. I wanted to focus on the job, because the dawn was such a special moment, forcing me to work even as the shadows changed every minute, the lines getting stronger as the sun brightened. </p><p>It forced me to capture the details, not allowing my attention to waver. I felt the familiar sense of concentration filling my consciousness. At that moment, nothing mattered. My lack of a sustainable income, my broken relationship with my only living parent, my fears about not making it up as a painter, not even the sexy but clumsy nerdy almost-coed that was resting back in the RV. Nothing mattered other than the beautiful dance of the shadows and the textures under the beautiful music of the sunrise. My pencil danced on yet another paper as I ripped the previous one aggressively, throwing it on the rapidly growing pile of crumpled papers…</p><p>The minutes rolled into hours as the pile grew bigger and bigger, the heat slowly getting unbearable with the unceasing climb of the sun. When I stopped, my mouth was dry and my skin was covered with sweat. Still, I stopped not because of the exhaustion, but the sun was high enough that the shadows turned thick and stale, depriving me of that amazing evolution of the light. </p><p>A sigh escaped my mouth as I turned, only to come face to face with Anna, who was standing several feet away, semi-hidden behind a tree trunk, watching me. “G-good morning!” she stammered in shock, her voice unnecessarily loud. </p><p>Someone was feeling awkward after the last night’s adventure, I deduced with a smirk. “Good morning,” I answered as I bent down, gathering the pile of crumpled paper I created during my session, trying to ignore my thirst. “Did you sleep well?” </p><p>The suddenness of her blush surprised me, followed by a guilty shuffling of her feet. It was clear that she had never done something remotely close in the scale of naughtiness. Her guilt was almost a physical thing. I wished that I could ask her to maintain that pose and expression while I painted her. Pity that it was impossible, as if I asked that, it would have ruined the naturalness of the pose, which was the point in the first place. </p><p>It took almost a minute for her to suppress her panic, while I continued gathering the papers from the ground. “It was okay,” she replied after almost a minute of shuffling. She seemed to realize I had no comment about her naughtiness last night, naturally assuming that I had failed to notice the evidence she had left behind. “Do you need something?” she added. </p><p>“Well, I wouldn’t say no to a cold bottle of water,” I answered. </p><p>“On it,” she answered as she dashed back, using it as an excuse to calm herself. Meanwhile, I finished gathering the papers, and once again sat on the broken trunk, examining the results of my practice session. I grabbed my red pen and started taking notes and making corrections from the memory, just to make sure that I didn’t lose anything. </p><p>However, when I noticed Anna walking toward me hurriedly, my focus slipped a bit. How could it not, when her generous torso danced with her every step despite her strong bra and a loose t-shirt. Her sweatpants were even worse than her t-shirt, managing to hide her surprisingly tight ass completely. </p><p>No wonder she didn’t receive much attention from the boys. </p><p>“Here,” she said as she enthusiastically pushed the bottle toward me, giving me a smile. </p><p>“Thanks, sweetie,” I said, which made her avoid my gaze shyly in an instant. I looked at her, expecting her to leave, which was surprising when she stayed still. “Tell me,” I said with a soft, encouraging smile. </p><p>“Um…” she murmured, followed by a mumbled, speedy sentence. “Do you mind if I stay here while you’re working? It’s very interesting.”</p><p>“Sure,” I said immediately, gesturing her to sit on the trunk as well. She did so, but made sure to put quite a bit of distance between us. I stayed focused on my work, as well as separating the ones that seemed worthwhile to keep as a reference for future work. </p><p>For almost ten minutes, I worked in silence while she watched me, though I noticed her gaze lingering on my naked torso whenever she was sure I wouldn’t notice. Still, that didn’t mean that she was using my painting as an excuse, as I could see her examining my sketches with great intensity, only that my muscular, tanned torso provided too much distraction for little virgin eyes. </p><p>“You really like painting,” she finally stated. </p><p>“I do,” I answered, aware that asking that question was the limit of her courage. So, I continued. “I always liked working with paint, but even as a child, it was not just a game,” I told her. “There’s something special in capturing a moment with paint and brush, like a little butterfly encased in amber, fragile yet immortal.” </p><p>“It must be nice, feeling passionate toward something,” she wistfully said, like she wasn’t aware of the sincerity of her own words. </p><p>“I couldn’t complain,” I said, then curiously added. “Don’t you have a hobby, or a passion?” </p><p>“I like … reading,” she murmured, but from the way her voice trembled, she knew that it wasn’t an answer. Her awkwardness was almost physical. </p><p>“So is every college graduate trying to get their first job if their CV to be believed,” I said playfully, which managed to earn a small smile from her. “Don’t worry about it,” I continued. “Life is always evolving. You never know where you will find meaning,” I said. “You just need to try different things and see what you enjoy. This trip is an excellent start for it.” </p><p>“Still, it must be nice to create something,” she said.</p><p>“I wouldn’t spend the most productive years of my life trying to advance my craft if I didn’t believe it,” I answered, trying to think of a way to dispel the awkwardness. Anna was clearly feeling inferior and empty, which wasn’t something I was seeing for the first time. In college, I had seen a lot of overachieving students with good grades, which filled their free time with debate, chess, cello, and many other activities; not because they enjoyed it, but because it would increase their chances of admission. I always thought it to be a waste. “You just need to find yours.” </p><p>“Sometimes, I feel like I don’t have anything like that-” she tried to continue, only to yelp when I flicked a few drops of cold water to her face. “What was that!” she exclaimed in shock. </p><p>“I just wanted to disperse your pity-party,” I said. “I understand where you’re coming from, but lamenting your lost time wouldn’t help you. You just need to try until you find it.” Normally, that would have been the end of my motivational speech, but since she had been naughty enough to peek at me in the shower and molest while I was supposed to be sleeping, I decided to mess with her a bit. “We can start experimenting right now.” </p><p>“What do you mean?” </p><p>“Well, what do you think of modeling for a charcoal drawing,” I said. </p><p>“Right now?”</p><p>“Yeah,” I answered with a shrug. “It’s not like we need to be somewhere.” </p><p>“I don’t know. I’m not exactly…” she said, lingering for a moment, no doubt about to say something about not being beautiful, but failed to utter them. Her confidence needed to work. “Isn’t modeling a bit … passive,” she said instead. </p><p>“Hey, don’t diss modeling. It's a job that’s unfairly underestimated.” </p><p>“Sorry,” she said immediately, avoiding my gaze, preparing to leave rather than facing my confrontation, however weak. She really needed some confidence in non-academic topics.  </p><p>“Don’t worry, you’re beautiful enough,” I said without prompting. </p><p>“It’s not-” she said, only for her complaint to fade immediately against a raised eyebrow. “I’m not-” she tried to continue, but failed once more. “I’m not exactly popular,” she decided to say in the end, like that explained everything. </p><p>“And what does have to with it your beauty?” </p><p>“What?” she said, shocked by my question. “Isn’t it clear? Beautiful girls receive more attention.” </p><p>“Is there anything I can say that would convince you otherwise?” I asked with a soft smile. </p><p>“It didn’t work when my mother tried,” she answered, surprising cheeky considering her shyness, probably encouraged by my calm demeanor. </p><p>“Okay, then I want you to sit silently for half an hour, as still as possible. Can you do that for me?” </p><p>She nodded, confusion mixed with hesitancy. However, she lacked the confidence to reject a direct request. I had to actively suppress the dirty part of my brain in terms of the possibilities afforded by such obedience. </p><p>I intended to draw two portraits. For the first one, I barely spent ten minutes, focusing on to be as realistic as possible, though I added a few hard-to-notice details such as slouched posture, unfocused eyes, and thinned lips to make it even less appealing than her already unassuming daily demeanor. When I finished it, I put it on the top of the paper pile without allowing her to see it. </p><p>Then, I started on the second one. It was still her portrait, but this time, I gave her a makeover, the kind that could easily be applied by a dedicated hairdresser in a few hours. I still drew her hair in a ponytail, but it was smoother, more elegant. There was some makeup around her eyes, but more importantly, the shadow of a smile was reflected in them. Her lips, rather than pressed thin stressfully, was curled in a cute but seductive smile, their thickness enhanced by the imaginary application of dark lipstick. </p><p>My pencil danced over the paper with a mission to unearth her true potential with great success. The imaginary makeup helped, but the real benefit came from the change in her expression. The portrait reflected quiet yet playful confidence, the kind only a woman that was sure of her sexuality could reflect, underlining her beauty without extreme sexualization. </p><p>The same expression she wore while she played with my body while she was in the depths of her arousal, unaware that I was watching her. </p><p>The charcoal pencil slid across the whiteness of the paper, staining it with magical precision, unearthing the picture it contained. The haphazard streaks and twirls slowly turned into a profile of a young woman, sexy and confident. </p><p>Then, I noticed her expression of awe as she watched me work, and suddenly, I felt the grip of the muse. I lost control of my pencil, watching helplessly as it rebelled, adding line despite exhausting the promised half an hour. </p><p>The picture grew with the addition of her collarbones and shoulders, both currently hidden underneath her shirt. Luckily, those lines were still sharp in my memory after watching her naked naughtiness the last night, so I was able to stay true to reality as I let the portrait grow. At the bottom of the page, there was even a glimpse of her cleavage, but I resented the smallness of the paper. I wished that there was still space, so I could draw the rest of her beautiful body… </p><p>“Done,” I said, able to keep the small bitterness away from my tone. I had a month together. It shouldn’t be impossible to convince her to some risque modeling. I passed the first portrait to her, the plain one. </p><p>The moment her eyes met with the portrait, her awe and excitement was replaced with a bitter expression. “I see,” she murmured. </p><p>I flicked her nose. “Hey, don’t be like that before seeing the second one,” I said. “This is the bad one.” </p><p>“How much of a difference there is,” she said coldly. </p><p>“Why don’t you tell me,” I said even as I flipped my notebook, giving her a glimpse of the enhanced portrait. </p><p>“No!” she gasped, but this time, her tone was tinged with disbelief and shock. “That’s not me! You cheated.” </p><p>I smirked, not even bothering to reign in my smugness after creating a portrait I was proud of. “Really, then why don’t you put two of them side to side, and tell me where exactly I cheated, and changed something that’s not possible without a dedicated professional and a more confident expression.” </p><p>“The lips-” she started, but I cut in. </p><p>“Nope, just a touch of imaginary lipstick and a sexy smile,” I explained. </p><p>“Eyebrows-” she tried to continue, only for me to invalidate that in a second. The next five minutes passed with her giving several examples, and I carefully explaining that there was no difference anatomically between the two portraits, just a better attitude, and some subtle makeup tricks. Though, I was amused to note that she said nothing about the presence of her naked shoulders or the hint of cleavage despite her finger dragging over those parts gently several times. </p><p>“Impossible,” she murmured again, but this time, it was not a statement of angry disbelief, but one of awe and wonder, just like a forgotten stepchild that received the offer of transformation from her fairy godmother. </p><p>An interesting discussion awaited me… </p>",

    "content": "<p>I finally let my gaze wander around the room as I waited for Oeyne to get ready. </p><p>Just a glance was enough to detect that the place was a modified warehouse, but had gone through a severe renovation. Apart from her living quarters, her workshop was an open-plan space. A huge forge, clearly expensive, stood in the middle of the room, bubbling with magic even in its inactive state. It was old enough to show the signs of age, managing to survive past the standard expiration date for an ordinary magical item through maintenance. It paid to be owned by a blacksmith expert. Interestingly, the forge was clearly transported here recently, and the rest of the renovations weren’t that old. Her move couldn’t be any earlier than a year, and I was willing to bet for six months.  </p><p>The rest of the workshop paled compared to the forge, but that didn’t mean that they were of low quality. She had some alchemy tools on a corner, which was useful in processing magical reagents collected from the monsters. It was possible to process them without any equipment like I had been doing, of course, but not only it was much costlier in terms of mana consumption, but also it was quite wasteful. Other than that, a number of tools were spread around the room, giving it a messy feeling. Too messy for an expert, unless she was used to working together with assistants and apprentices to handle those things. </p><p>It made a certain kind of sense with Aviada’s offhand comments about the argument between Oeyne and the craftsmen guilds. She was clearly an accomplished blacksmith, the half-completed weapons resting on the table were exquisite enough to prove that fact. I didn’t know whether she was always living at Silver Spires, or moved here after her fight with the Guilds, but whichever was the case, I doubted that it was something simple if the Guilds were exerting enough pressure to actually prevent her from finding an apprentice to help her.</p><p>It also gave me an opportunity to gain her favor.</p><p>I could see a bookcase filled with books, and a soft probe made sure that there was no magical protection. Since half of the objects were warded in the workshop, I guessed that they weren’t very valuable from her perspective. I walked to the shelf, and pulled a book, only to see it was the notes of a previous apprentice, focusing on basic techniques and procedures. As I read, I couldn’t help but quirk my eyebrow. Whomever the apprentice was, they had excellent notetaking capabilities, not only recording their lessons but also comparing them with more common techniques, followed by a detailed breakdown of the advantages and disadvantages. I read it, because while the library had quite a number of books about blacksmithing, they were much more focused on theory. The guide in front of me was giving me a lot of interesting insights. </p><p>Of course, since they were personal notes, the writer neglected to explain the simpler points, sometimes just abbreviating things into single letters. Most people would have been helpless against it, but it was different for me. With my Wisdom allowing me to fill the blanks and my Intelligence helping to connect the dots, I had gained a lot of insights about being a blacksmith just by reading. I wouldn’t be forging my own sword anytime soon, but it was definitely a benefit. </p><p>When I heard her bathroom door open, I put the book back and moved to my seat. Instead, I pulled a valuable piece of material from my bag, and started processing it by applying my Arcana abilities, fashioning it into a keystone for a medium-powered defensive ward. It wasn’t the full range of my abilities, but it was still a task that would challenge usual people that managed to attain Arcana Master skill. Not everyone had almost forty points of Charisma to power their spells. </p><p>A minute later, the bedroom door opened, and revealed Oeyne, wearing a pair of long pants and a long-sleeved shirt. Her hair was collected to a simple ponytail, and a pair of combat boots competed for the ensemble. However, despite the simple and boring description, her clothing was anything but. Her pants were made of leather, and certainly too tight to be comfortable working in a workshop unless it was enchanted. It wrapped tight around her body, displaying her beautiful legs in full display. </p><p>Her shirt was made of thick linen, and was much looser, though it still strategically tightened enough to display her hourglass figure. More interestingly, a huge gap in the middle traveled down, creating an aggressive cleavage, deep enough to reveal the continuing absence of a bra. I made no attempt to hide my gaze as I examined her figure, pausing on her cleavage for a couple of seconds before finding her face. </p><p>Even if I had failed to understand her aim earlier, her smile, supported by her enchanting gait, told the whole story. She was teasing me, and if I was reading correctly, with no intention of actually carrying me to her bed. So, she either wanted to take revenge for the massage session in kind, or she wanted to unbalance me before our negotiation. Maybe, both of them were her aim together. </p><p>Whichever was the case, I was more than happy to contend against her in her chosen battleground. </p><p>Supporting my earlier detection, she plopped herself next to me without saying anything, close enough for our arms to rub together, which was certainly not proper. She smiled at me seductively, and while it was tempting to play the simpering fool, she seemed like a gal who would enjoy pushing my buttons. It might have been an option under different circumstances, but with the pressure from the necromancers and their mysterious allies, I didn’t have the time to play the lovesick teenager for a couple of weeks.</p><p>I met with her seductive smile with a confident one of my own, making her smile freeze for a moment before it widened a bit. “Sorry to keep you waiting,” she said, with just a little bit of gasp that sent a tingling across my body. For a supposed blacksmith with a wild look, she was surprisingly adept at the game of seduction. Her willingness to show skin enhanced her game to the next level. </p><p>“Please. I’m the one that came early and disrupted your rest. I should be the one apologizing,” I said, not keeping myself from catching another glimpse of her impressive cleavage since she was kind enough to lean forward. I raised my hand, and showed the mostly-processed reagent in my hand. “It’s not like I was wasting my time,” I said. </p><p>“Hmm,” she murmured as she turned her attention to it, her eyes widening slightly as she took a note of my expertise. I wasn’t a dedicated alchemist, but that didn’t mean my work was something to be dismissed. It was certainly far above what she could manage with her skills. “Impressive work,” she admitted. “It’s not easy to process the tooth of a golden lion without a complete set of equipment, even for a dedicated apprentice.” </p><p>“I do my best,” I said with a soft smirk. “I’m glad that it’s good enough not to be an eyesore to a true master of the craft like yourself,” I added, and she smiled, though she wasn’t impressed by it. As an expert blacksmith, she must be used to compliments and people playing nicely while trying to commission a sword. </p><p>“So, what are you going to use it for, as an offensive node for a larger ward, or something more interesting?” </p><p>“Certainly something more interesting,” I answered. “The tooth is useless in defense, but it has strong attack quality. By using seven of them, I can establish an attack ward. It will be a one-time effect, but it will certainly be impressive.” </p><p>“It should be, if it’s going to consume seven golden lion teeth,” she suggested. “It’s a bit on the costly side, of course,” she added. </p><p>She delivered the latter part of it without any fluctuation in her tone, perfectly flatly, which would have convinced a lot of people that it was just an offhand comment. Not me. I easily recognized it as a good attempt to assess my net worth. She was more sly than my first impression suggested, though it made me even more excited about the prospect. “It’s just golden lion teeth,” I said dismissively. “They are at most uncommon.” </p><p>She nodded at my answer, but her smile widened at my dismissive attitude. If she was as terrible in gambling as Aviada suggested, it wasn’t surprising for her to get excited about my potential wealth, especially with the guilds blacklisting her. </p><p>“I’m not familiar with the carving method,” she said. “Is this a way to connect with the nearest node?” </p><p>“Actually, no,” I answered. “Through that carving, I’m planning to connect it to the other six teeth directly, establishing a tighter formation. That way, it can explode spectacularly.” </p><p>“As long as you can keep it until the last moment,” she countered, her eyes tightening. She wasn’t a magical expert, but as I expected, she had good instincts about ward establishment. In the higher levels, it probably shared many fundamental concepts with blacksmithing. So, I didn’t dumb down my explanation too much as I explained to her how I was planning to stabilize the attack formation by relying on neutralizing the pressure by using the other teeth. It took ten minutes, and she listened in rapt attention, though she continuously touched my arm and shoulder, playing it as a distraction. </p><p>“I wasn’t expecting a warrior student to have such a deep attainment in the magical theory,” Oeyne commented after I had finished my explanation. </p><p>“I saw myself more of a mage than a warrior,” I answered. “It’s a bit shameful, but I have to admit I first picked the sword as a part of a childish rebellion against my family, but after realizing the potential of versatility, I continued to develop it,” I said. “A stronger selection of activities is certainly useful.”  </p><p>“A commendable approach,” she said passionately. It personally resonated with her, but it was too early to easily ascertain whether it was a candid emotion, or she was just using the opportunity to subtly make fun of the guilds without being committed to the idea herself. It was a mystery for another day. “And I’m guessing you’re here to get something better than the garbage you have on your waist.” </p><p>“Exactly,” I answered. “Since I’m going to do something unusual, I better do it with a true masterpiece in my hands.” </p><p>“A good approach,” she said. “It’s a pity you’re going to be disappointed though,” she added, making a show of looking sad. </p><p>She clearly had something in mind, and while I could guess where she was driving at, I decided to play oblivious. “That’s a pity,” I said with a sigh. “I was hoping to wield a sword shaped by your masterful hands.” </p><p>She sighed loudly. “It’s not that I don’t want to help, but I’m currently in the midst of a small dispute with the guilds, and I don’t have a helper to assist me. I can still make something strong by myself, but it won’t be something that deserved to be called a masterpiece.” I waited a bit, making a show of looking disappointed, wordlessly inviting her to breach the subject. </p><p>[+2 Subterfuge] </p><p>A smile appeared on her face, like she had just an idea. “Actually, you are not bad when it comes to preparing reagents. You waste quite a bit, but the final quality is more than satisfactory. As long as you’re willing to help me, we should be able to create something I would be proud of.” </p><p>“That’s a tempting offer,” I said. “I accept.” It was quicker than I would have normally liked. Despite her attempts to conceal it, she was clearly enthusiastic about having me as temporary help. I had no doubt that helping her while she was being blacklisted by the guilds had some dangerous consequences. I could have used those potential consequences to extract several concessions from her, but at the cost of revealing my true nature, which would have made her cautious. Also, I didn’t want to join a craftsmen guild, and even if I changed my mind, I could easily apply to a position through brand new identity. </p><p>It was for the best if she thought I could be manipulated by a flash of tits and promises of a better weapon. They were currencies I was more than happy to deal with as well, though the cost itself was going to be much higher. “Do you have any preferences?” she said. </p><p>“Actually, I do,” I said as I raised my steel sword, letting my Arcana energy to flow freely, giving the otherwise mundane sword a dangerous feeling. </p><p>[-57 Mana]</p><p>“Interesting,” she murmured as she watched the magic flow. “But ultimately, very wasteful.”</p><p>“That’s because steel is a terrible medium to conduct magic, and it corrodes too easily,” I answered. “If we use something more malleable like alchemical silver with several reagents added to keep the magic from radiating uselessly, it should be much more effective.” </p><p>She frowned. “Still, isn’t it strictly inferior to a traditional magical sword? While it would be cheaper, it would still be impressively expensive. On the added side, you won’t waste any mana while using it.” </p><p>I said nothing as I raised my sword, repeating the trick once again, but this time, adding some fire nature to my Arcana trick. It wasn’t a full elemental spell —which wasn’t an ability I wanted to reveal her— but it was still impressive. Best of all, it was possible to do through Arcana. She watched the trick with interest, and just to drive my point, I quickly cycled through multiple elements, using lightning, water, and wind in quick succession. It barely lasted more than five seconds, but the rapid change turned the steel sword into useless molten slag. </p><p>“That was rather interesting, and certainly hard to replicate in a magical sword,” she commented. “I can see why you want that. Follow me.” </p><p>With that, she stood up and walked toward the forge, and I followed her a step behind. Her earlier measured gait was replaced by a determined walk, too focused on what I had shown to remember her seduction game. I was a bit bummed at the temporary loss of my entertainment. Thankfully, even without her intentional seduction attempts, her ass looked great in her tight leather pants. When she reached the forge, she grabbed a leather work apron from a drawer and put it on, which unfortunately concealed her beautiful cleavage. </p><p>“About the payment,” she suddenly added, realizing that in her excitement to work on a new theory, she had forgotten to talk about such an important topic. I nodded, waiting for her to continue, leveraging her impatience. “I want to receive two times the material that has been used consumed in the process of forging your items,” she said. </p><p>It was certainly a steep price, one that she used as an aggressive negotiation opener, so, my answer surprised her quite a bit. “Sure,” I said casually. “It’s not a big deal.” </p><p>Her eyes widened, her thoughts reflected on her face. She was clearly cursing herself for being impatient. It was easy to read her emotions. If she was as open when gambling, her losing streak wasn’t simply bad luck. “Okay,” she murmured, unable to hide the sense of defeat. After all, she couldn’t raise the price above what she had offered after I accepted, not without destroying the goodwill between us, at least. “You already managed to surprise me once when it came to using magical reagents. Do you want to try again?” </p><p>“Why not,” I said as I dug into my bag, and started pulling some select items. They weren’t the most expensive materials I owned, but they certainly weren’t the cheapest as well. Still, since I was planning for another hunting trip tonight —this time hopefully without stumbling on another wild conspiracy— I wasn’t conservative dipping in my savings. Most were already gone, either to my own wards, or the escape tunnel I had set up for the necromancer base. </p><p>“Interesting,” she murmured as she looked at the materials that spread out over the table—and two piles with the same materials placed in front of Oeyne. Her pouty lips parted in excitement as she reached for the piles that were was going to be her payment, followed by a sigh. However, her happiness was a bit exaggerated considering her position and potential wealth. I couldn’t help but feel like it had something to do with her gambling problem, maybe she owed the others some money. Then, she spoke, forcing me to focus on the present. “It’s an impressive ward, but I think I’m unable to connect some of the details. Why don’t you explain it to me.” </p><p>I did so, and after some time, she interrupted. “It looks like a good idea, but it wouldn’t work on a forged item,” she offered. I nodded in understanding. It was my first time working on metal, and there bound to be surprised. </p><p>“How about now?” I asked, and she countered once more, which started a rather interesting discussion. My visit was turning even more interesting than I first assumed. </p><p>We have talked for half an hour, discussing various theories until we finally agreed on a set of features. The implementation of the ideas was solely her responsibility, of course. Embedding magical abilities during the forging process was much different than enchanting them afterward, or using wards to replicate the effects. My contribution was already well-above what was expected. </p><p>“I’ll alert the girl once the dagger is ready, but it might take a few days,” she said after the discussion, not even offering me to watch the process. Understandable considering her secret techniques, but still a pity. She didn’t even ask for my help to process the reagents, as we tried to keep the requirements for the dagger considerably low, since it was still an experimental product, with no great material requirements. </p><p>“Any chance for a rush order,” I said, only to receive a deadpan look from her. I chuckled. Her response was understandable, as even the simplest magical item normally took weeks to forge, and she was going to forge an experimental one in a few days. It was enough of a miracle as it was. </p><p>“See you in three days, then,” I sighed as I left the room, but not before feeling a playful slap on my bottom. </p><p>I couldn’t wait to respond to that in kind. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 24    Experience: 279400 / 300000 </p><p>Strength: 28    Charisma: 38</p><p>Precision: 21    Perception: 27</p><p>Agility: 25     Manipulation: 30</p><p>Speed: 23       Intelligence: 30</p><p>Endurance: 22      Wisdom: 33</p><p>HP: 2856 / 2856 Mana: 3792 / 3792        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Expert Arcana [75/75]        </p><p>Expert Subterfuge [54/75]         </p><p>Basic Speech [25/25]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p>",

    "content": "<p>We spent another half an hour on the balcony after Carla’s shocked departure, which reinvigorated me completely. We could have continued, but I was excited about finally getting a weapon of my own. Inevitably, it was going to be inferior to Aviada’s, but still, it was a good trade-off for continuous access. </p><p>I followed Aviada from a distance as she moved toward a stocky building near the center of the campus, once again dressed as yet another warrior student, which worked wonders to avoid attention.  </p><p>[+1 Subterfuge]</p><p>A smile popped on my face as I read the notification, feeling nostalgic. It was barely more than a month ago when I first received my Subterfuge skill, which allowed me to carve a place for myself without trying to fend off scalpels of curious experimenters. Even now, it allowed me to play a game that was above my potential. I had to admit that it was a true shock. When I was below level ten, I was sure that level twenty was an unreachable goal, one that would ensure my safety once reached. That turned out not to be the case. I was level twenty-four, with an unbelievable stat distribution to boot, and still needed to stay concealed. The stronger I got, the more threats  I faced. </p><p>Apparently, there was a reason the world was teetering on the edge of a collapse despite countless heroes. Under the impressive sheen of legends and magic, lay a dangerous rot. </p><p>I focused on the present as we entered the building dedicated to the craftsmen. The first thing that got my attention was the noise. It was unbearable. The shouts of the servants, the clanking of the metal, the low hum of the wards, and even the occasional explosions. A crowd of servants was bustling around, carrying trays and cases filled with half-processed materials. The crowd occasionally parted, letting one of the core craftsmen pass through, with great variety. Enchanters, blacksmiths, wardmasters, each giving off a subtle aura of expertise. </p><p>However, I noticed something interesting. There was a great variety of experts in the building, but in no area other than the main corridor, the building was clearly separated into areas, and I could see no expert from a different discipline. Each expert clearly preferred their own group, and the others even avoided the side corridors that connected. Even more, whenever an expert came across another, the tension between them was clear. Alchemists avoided blacksmiths, engravers glared at tailors, the leather workers disdained enchanters… </p><p>Weird, I thought, doing my best to listen as Aviada guided me deeper into the building. Their distaste for each other was clear, but understanding the reason for it was a bit more difficult. Meanwhile, we walked until we reached the stairs, and used them to go down four floors, each floor showing less and less movement, as the space underground was mostly used for storage. Even so, as we moved down, I could sense the wards around the storage rooms weakening, which implied that they were using those rooms for less precious knick-knacks rather than anything precious. </p><p>We left the stairs after arriving at the fourth underground floor, the place was empty other than a few servants trying to pull some items from storage. Since there was no one around us, I started walking next to Aviada once more. “What’s the deal with the craftsmen avoiding each other?” I asked. </p><p>“Something about guild budgets and the number of candidates they are allowed to host here,” Aviada explained dismissively, once again showing her direct personality. I sighed. She had an excellent mentality for combat, wasn’t afraid of risks, and her loyalty was certain, but still, I couldn’t trust her with anything important in other areas due to her dismissive attitude. If it wasn’t something she could cut down with her sword, she wasn’t interested, which made her a poor assistant for anything complicated.   </p><p>“Guilds?” I asked, feeling curious. I had been planning to do some research about the production facilities before I visited, which unfortunately went awry due to my repeated lack of luck. Trying to figure out my new Tantric skill, or investigating the necromancer activities took priority. If it was even two weeks ago, I would have rescheduled and done my research no matter how much I needed a weapon, but with my power, there were only a few people I still feared in the school, such as Titania, and the mysterious Headmistress. </p><p>“Yeah, the craftsmen are not a part of the student body, so they need to get permission from the school to operate here,” Aviada explained carelessly. </p><p>That explanation didn’t clear up my confusion. “But why are they so against each other’s presence?” I asked.</p><p>“Something about limited spots and competition between the guilds,” Aviada murmured with a shrug. “Oeyne explained it before, but I don’t remember. You can talk to her about it.” </p><p>I sighed, not bothering to hide my disappointment. True to her personality, Aviada didn’t care. It was doubtful whether she even noticed. We covered the rest of the distance in silence, moving deeper into the floor, so much that even the occasional servant carrying stuff disappeared. When Aviada mentioned that Oeyne didn’t like to work with the other craftsmen, I was expecting a slight distaste, not a total social shunning. Not that I had any problem with that. As long as she was skilled, her lack of connections worked to my benefit. </p><p>“We’re here,” Aviada said as she stood in front of a door that stood out from the other doors on the floor, which were gray and featureless. The door was made from pure iron, and engraved with silver. It radiated magic, so it was not just a door but a magical artifact. She might be ostracized and have a gambling problem, but that didn’t mean she was poor. After all, for a skilled blacksmith, it wasn’t hard to get extra funds as long as they were willing to work hard. </p><p>Interestingly, however, other than the door, which was a standalone artifact, the rest of the wards weren’t particularly strong. So, she either used the door as an advertisement of her skills and wasn’t afraid of danger, or she didn’t have any capable helper for the wards. I was quite curious about which, because the latter part gave me an in to prove myself. “Have you talked with her about me?” I asked. </p><p>“I mentioned that you’re a friend who needs a weapon and willing to be very generous in terms of payment,” Aviada answered. </p><p>“Good,” I said. “Then, as far as she’s concerned, I’m a mage that chose to branch out as a warrior just to annoy my family,” I said. She looked at me questioningly. “I might need to show off some of my magical abilities, and if I also show myself as a full-fledged warrior, my magical abilities and their implications would make her suspicious,” I explained. Magical abilities were different, especially if I stick to Arcana and avoid Biomancy. </p><p>“If you say so,” Aviada answered with a shrug, not really interested in my tricks. Earlier in our relationship, it would have earned a more explosive reaction, but she had been farming quite a bit of reward from my sneaky approach, which went a long way to mollify her distaste for subterfuge. </p><p>She knocked on the door, only to be met with silence. She waited a minute before knocking again, this time stronger. Again, silence. “Maybe she’s not in her workshop yet?” I said. “Should we try her room instead?” </p><p>“This is her room,” Aviada answered with a scoff, and knocked on the door once more. However, this time, she used the pommel of her sword rather than her hand, making a truly unbearable sound, even leaving a mark on the metal door. </p><p>That earned a response. “Who the fuck is it at this forsaken hour,” came a groggy voice from the other side of the door. </p><p>“It’s already afternoon, Oeyne,” Aviada shouted back. </p><p>“It’s still early. Why are you here?” her shout came back. </p><p>“We already talked about this. I have a friend with me to commission a weapon. Do you want him to go to the Blacksmith Guild to commission one?” Aviada shouted back, but she was smiling. </p><p>“If he wants me to do anything this early, he can go fuck himself for all I care,” she answered back. </p><p>“Charming lady,” I commented, unable to keep my smirk contained. </p><p>Aviada laughed. “Even if he can cure your hangover?” </p><p>The shout that replied was different, replacing annoyance with enthusiasm. “Why didn’t you tell me that first, you silly girl,” she shouted immediately. As we waited, we heard a couple of doors being slammed, followed by more profanity. </p><p>“Do you want me to stay, or can you handle it?” Aviada asked. </p><p>“I’m sure I can handle it,” I answered. If her enthusiasm about the hangover cure was any indicator, I didn’t need Aviada to break the ice between us, and considering I was going to rely on my mage persona to further my relationship with her, she couldn’t exactly help me. </p><p>Then, the door opened, giving me the first glimpse of the mystery blacksmith, making my eyes widen slightly, along with a notification. </p><p>[+75 Experience] 25% Penalty! </p><p>The experience is nothing much at my current level, but the fact that I received any experience meant that she was level twenty-four just like me, making her a true powerhouse craftsman. I didn’t know a lot about the Blacksmith Guild and other organizations, but I was willing to bet that they weren’t filled with powerhouses like that, making her ostracization a true mystery.</p><p>But the political ramifications took the backseat as I turned my full focus to examine her, unable to keep my smirk as I did so. I received to experience the moment I saw her, because she was wearing only a dressing gown, its front loose enough to show her lack of a bra, instead of giving me a glimpse of her spectacular, caramel-colored bosom, looking delicious enough to eat. </p><p>To make things even more interesting, before I could raise my eyes to look at her face, she grabbed my wrist and pulled me inside, hard enough to break the arm of a weaker man. She was very strong. Even from a casual pull, from the ease she achieved it, I was confident that her Strength was above twenty, but I wasn’t sure about the exact number. “Are you coming, girl,” she said without bothering to look at Aviada, who was watching us with a mischievous smile, clever enough to realize the ultimate ending for her friend. </p><p>I was so lucky that I had fucked jealousy out of Aviada.  </p><p>“I have a mission, so no,” Aviada answered, and closed the door, leaving us alone. </p><p>Oeyne grunted in response as she pulled me toward a seat in the corner, and sat down, looking exhausted. “Cure, now, or I break you, boy,” she grunted even as she pressed her hands to her temple. </p><p>I was curious just how much she drank last night. She was clearly strong, and as a blacksmith, I doubted that her Endurance was below fifteen. To make her feel such an explosive hangover, she must have imbibed a tub. However, rather than trying to estimate it, I pulled out a bottle that was filled with a purple fluid which I created through biomancy. It was basically a concentrated solution of minerals that would help replace the loss of energy. All she needed was to drink it, and her hangover would be gone in fifteen minutes. </p><p>However, that was the plan before I saw her. Even with her brown hair disheveled horribly, her face contorted in discomfort, and giving out a thick smell of alcohol, she was beautiful. She certainly wasn’t young, probably in her forties, but like the wine she was clearly fond of, the years just made her tastier. She was almost six feet, making her just a few inches shorter than me, and her body was toned to perfection. Thanks to the supernatural nature of her strength, she wasn’t overly muscular, making her tight body delicious, especially combined with her caramel skin tone. I couldn’t wait until I could get a taste. </p><p>“Here it is,” I said as I raised the bottle. She grabbed the bottle immediately and was about to drink it. Suddenly, I understood why Aviada liked her. They were both recklessly forward, making me wonder how the hell they managed to survive in such a dangerous world. Maybe there was a hidden luck stat, and theirs were off-the-charts? </p><p>I decided to leverage her direct personality. “If you drink it, it’ll take effect in fifteen minutes, or I can apply it through your neck and use magic to activate it, and it’ll work in a minute.” </p><p>She said nothing, not that she needed to. She gave me the bottle before turning around, and pulled her dressing gown enough to give me a glimpse of her shoulders, making my erection grow even after the hour I had spent with Aviada. “Hurry up,” she said. </p><p>[+150 Experience] 25% Penalty! </p><p>I quickly poured the potion on her shoulders before starting my massage, my fingers already dancing on her shoulders. Since Aviada mentioned Oeyne had some magical abilities, I couldn’t be as direct as I wanted to be. Using my healing abilities directly wasn’t an option, as it would raise a question about the need for the potion, not to mention I was trying to sell myself as an Arcana expert. </p><p>Thankfully, my magical abilities were more than enough to trick such an amateur. I used a large amount of Arcana-natured mana to blanket her senses, making the magical signature of the potion too chaotic to sense. Only after, I used my healing abilities to ease her hangover, while simultaneously making her body absorb the potion. However, even that part was a distraction, as if noticed, it wasn’t exactly hard to explain. I wanted to reach into her soul space, getting a glimpse of her skills and abilities. </p><p>Since she wasn’t relaxed enough for that, I decided to help her with that aspect first. Repeated sessions with Marianne had made me an expert on the subject, so after I let my hands free on her neck and shoulders, it didn’t take long for her pained moans to be replaced by satisfied grunts. In a minute, her back was arching sexily as my fingers destroyed knot after knot in her back. She desperately needed a massage, it seemed. Not surprising considering the physical strain of being a blacksmith, combined with her drinking habits. But her sexy moans made it hard for me to keep my hands in safe places. </p><p>[+300 Experience] 25% Penalty! </p><p>[+2 Subterfuge]</p><p>Rather than trying to sleep with her, I used the opportunity to slip a small stream of mana into her body, finding her soul space. She was too strong to process without a better understanding, especially since, unlike Titania, she wasn’t exhausted due to mana overuse. </p><p>The sensation of her soul space surprised me. It was significantly more defined than the girls, reminding me of Titania. Unlike her, however, Oeyne’s soul space was stiff, which meant that she had reached her level cap. A glimpse of her stats showed that she was primarily physical —no surprises there— with a particular focus on Strength and Endurance. However, her mental stats surprised me, because she had three stats over ten: Intelligence, Perception, and Wisdom. Intelligence and Perception were barely above ten, but still, it was impressive for a primarily-physical fighter, nothing I had seen before in someone else —though I couldn’t say I had a large pool of examples. Combined with her Level, it made her truly formidable. </p><p>So, formidable that, rather than trying to turn the massage into something more heated, I pulled my hands back after getting a glimpse of her skills, which were mostly crafting related, a specialized melee skill, and one advanced Arcana to give her some utility. I pulled back, not wanting to risk getting caught. She was strong, beautiful, and most importantly, clearly lacking in allies, making her an excellent prospect. I didn’t want to ruin it accidentally. </p><p>Also, it was always a good strategy to make a lady be left wanting… </p><p>“That’s it,” I said as I pulled back, cutting her moan off halfway. She looked back, her eyes widening slightly, only then realizing the inappropriateness of the situation. She fixed her dressing gown, though even as she did so, she managed to surprise me once more. Rather than pulling it on hurriedly as Marianne would, or doing her best to look impassive like Titania, Oeyne fixed her dressing gown slowly, bordering inappropriate, a curious smile on her lips. </p><p>“That was rather impressive,” she said, her tone soft and silky now that she wasn’t shouting angrily. “I’m going to ask you to wait while I put on something more appropriate, wait here, and don’t touch anything,” she said, her tone sharpening at the last part. Still, any possible sting from her words disappeared when she turned around. She did so quickly, making her dressing gown rise, giving me a glimpse of her beautiful thighs, riding high enough to reveal that her bra wasn’t the only missing piece of underwear…</p><p>[+75 Experience] 25% Penalty! </p><p>I smiled as I watched her disappear into her bedroom. I liked Helga and the rest, but Oeyne’s mature, confident gait was a breath of fresh air. Working with her was going to be an interesting experience… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 24    Experience: 279400 / 300000 </p><p>Strength: 28    Charisma: 38</p><p>Precision: 21    Perception: 27</p><p>Agility: 25     Manipulation: 30</p><p>Speed: 23       Intelligence: 30</p><p>Endurance: 22      Wisdom: 33</p><p>HP: 2856 / 2856\tMana: 3792 / 3792        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Expert Arcana [75/75]        </p><p>Expert Subterfuge [52/75]         </p><p>Basic Speech [25/25]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p>",

    "content": "<p>“No, what?” I asked even as I watched her hands dance over her shirt, each button revealing more of her deliciously pale skin, still pristine despite the days we had spent under the sun. </p><p>“No, as in that wasn’t the reward,” she answered with a smug smirk, like the ones I had always sent her way, however, behind that, I can see a soft trembling. She wasn’t as confident as she wanted to portray. “It was just a warm-up.” </p><p>“Really,” I said with a matching smirk, not pointing at her sudden display of fragility. If she wanted to act braver, it wasn’t my place to discuss, especially when she was providing me with such a beautiful distraction, especially when she started to sway to imaginary music as she removed her shirt. It got even better when her hands reached to her pants, pushing them down with one smooth movement that fit perfectly to her dance. </p><p>I could feel my heartbeat picking up speed as she danced, unable to believe the seductive atmosphere she was able to create with just a sway of her hips. Her noble training naturally included dancing, but I had no idea that it could be converted to something like that. “Damn, it’s nice,” I moaned. “Where did you learn that?” </p><p>“One of my maids growing up was an ex-pleasure slave, and she thought it to me, suggesting that it might help me keep my man under control,” she said smugly even as her hands slowly traveled to her bra, gently caressing her belly enticingly on the way. She leaned down, her smile wider. At that moment, I wasn’t sure which was more attractive, her amazing cleavage, or her smile.  “Is it working?” </p><p>“Oh, honey. It’s definitely working,” I answered. “You have captured me, and I’m at your mercy.” </p><p>“Good,” she said as her hands suddenly found my shoulders and she pushed me until I was pressing against the tree. I said nothing, as I was supremely enjoying the sudden change of dynamic, where she was taking the initiative to seduce me. She sat on my lap, and her hips started to grind. Since my cock was still out, it was only her panties that prevented a naughty accident. </p><p>Despite that, she started rocking on my lap, even though her body continued to sway to the same imaginary melody. When I tried to put my hands on her body, I was dissuaded by a slap, signaling that she wanted to deliver her show without my intervention. It was not a big problem, as I leaned back, enjoying the treatment. Still, when her fingers found the buttons of my shirt, I couldn’t help but remind her. “We don’t have much time.” </p><p>“Make some,” her answer came back, and I could detect a hint of panting in her tone, one that was absent moments ago. Rubbing repeatedly against my hard shaft while enjoying my attention seemed to turn her on. “Tell them that we’re going to delay for another half an hour.” </p><p>It wasn’t the best idea to do so with the mysterious enemy behind us, but unfortunately, it was hard to make rational decisions when I had a barely-dressed sexy blonde on my lap, grinding repeatedly while giving me an excellent dance at the same time. So, I cast a simple spell, and send Astrid a message, telling her that we’re going to delay due to a magical reason, and she should inform the team. </p><p>I kept my eyes closed as I cast the spell. Before I opened them, I felt something wrap around my neck. I opened them, only to see that it was her bra. Using it to support herself, she leaned back, her back arching to put her naked breasts to perfect display, so perfect that I could never get bored of them no matter how many times I had seen them. Using her bra, she pulled herself close, her lips an inch away from my lips, only to stand up suddenly. </p><p>I bit my lips, doing my best not to order her back on my lap. I was already feeling horny due to her dance, and her reckless lapdance pushed it to the next level, but she chose to pull back just as things were getting good. Luckily, it was just the beginning of the show —assuming that’s the reason she asked me to extend our break by another half an hour— so I could temper my desire down temporarily while waiting for the show to pick up speed. </p><p>She didn’t keep me waiting for long. She turned her back, only to slowly lean forward, her legs straight, giving me an excellent show of her tight ass. Even better, she parted her legs slightly after a moment, giving me a glimpse of her nether lips pushing against the fabric of her panties, which was getting slightly see-through thanks to her arousal. When she stood up once more and turned to face me, her arm was around her breasts, hiding them from the view, which somehow added to the sexiness of the moment as she used her free hand to slowly get rid of her last piece of clothing, her lower body twisted strategically to hide it from the view, making my mouth water. </p><p>Then, without fully turning toward me, she moved her hands across her stomach once more, slowly climbing up to cup her breasts as she swayed, twisting her nipples invitingly. When she smiled and seductively raised both her arms over her head, exposing her breasts fully again, I wanted to stand up and take her there.</p><p>She was faster than me. She moved forward, and before I could move, was sitting on my lap once again, this time, her wetness rubbing against my shaft. “That’s a dangerous position,” I reminded her, letting my voice darken a bit, which was a better option than moaning in pleasure as her wetness rubbed against my length. </p><p>“I … know,” she whispered, soft and deliberate, making my shaft harden even more, the fact that her hips were moving faster and faster playing a big role as well. Her next words almost made me explode. “But I don’t care.” </p><p>There was something special at seeing Lillian acting like an exotic dancer that would fit perfectly in the harem of an Eastern Sultan, elegant, cultured, yet willing to do everything to make a man happy. Who knew there was such a gem lying underneath her cold noble identity. And just to make things more interesting, she was getting faster and faster. She captured my lips in a searing kiss while enjoying the treatment I was delivering. </p><p>But then, she surprised me once more. As she continued grinding on my lap as she kissed, but her movements changed. Her confidence slowly evaporated, leaving its place to hesitancy, even though she continued to kiss me. The reason showed itself a moment later, when she pulled higher, and when she lowered, my shaft was aligned against her entrance. “Are you sure?” I asked as I pulled back, her expression flickering. “With your responsibilities…” </p><p>It took almost a minute for her to answer. Emotions flickered in her face, her sense of propriety and responsibility fighting against her desires, all pushed further by the danger we were facing. “I don’t care,” she finally murmured, her words soft but heavier than a mountain. “We can die tomorrow, or worse, get captured. I want to be in control, even for a few minutes.” </p><p>“That’s a bleak estimation of my ability to stay hard,” I said playfully. </p><p>“Jerk, I’m trying to be serious,” she said and slapped my shoulder, but she was laughing as she did so, which dispelled the grim aura of her statement. She said nothing else, and there was nothing to say. She started to lower herself, excitement and fear dancing in her beautiful blue eyes as my shaft was finally enveloped by her tender warmth, only to come to a stop as it hit a barrier, one that she destroyed with one sharp push at the cost of a sharp hiss. </p><p>I kissed her, her tongue jumping out to greet me halfway, delivering a kiss that was more passionate than anything I had experienced. She surrendered herself to me and pleasure at the same time as her hips started to move, forcing her body to adapt to my size. Her movements were still hesitant, but the desire was burning in her eyes, destroying her fears and doubts. </p><p>However, my attention was grabbed by something more important. My magic was reacting. As I finally claimed her virginity, a wave of magic rose instinctively and invaded her body, mingling with her magic. I tried to stop it, but that only lasted for a moment before my instincts overrode me. It was like trying not to breathe, easy at first, but slowly turning impossible as my body overrode my decision. However, instead of happening in minutes, it happened in seconds, my magic mixing with hers. </p><p>Lillian was too distracted by her adventure to notice it, her eyes locked to mine, focusing on slowly riding me as her body got used to my presence. I tried to pull back to say something, but it proved to be impossible when she started another kiss, showing a rare initiative. Under the beautiful assault of her lips, I found myself unable to resist the temptation, not to mention. </p><p>I tried to examine the changes in her magic. which was a rather difficult thing to do with the exquisite distraction I had been struggling with. She kept her lips locked against mine even as she grabbed my wrists and guided my hands to her ass, her hips picking up speed despite the occasionally strained gasps. After a minute, I was able to decipher that whatever happening was not exactly harmful, which was all well, because Lillian that moment to quicken her speed even more, the resulting wave of pleasure thick enough to trigger my instincts. </p><p>A desire exploded in my heart, one that was both foreign and familiar at the same time, telling me to take possession of her for eternity, a call that was hard to resist under the calmest of circumstances, something my situation didn’t qualify. I found myself pushing my hips up to complete her motion. And soon, the pleasure climbed more and more, forcing me to focus on her supple body. </p><p>I pushed deep, and she pulled out of the kiss, her back arching beautifully as she moaned, her voice tickling my insides. A moment later, her lips met with mine again, her tongue dancing in my mouth in a delirious frenzy, picking up speed as I slammed inside her again and again. </p><p>I wasn’t the only one that was having trouble controlling myself. </p><p>I started slamming harder and harder inside her as the signs of her discomfort disappeared, allowing me to enjoy her beauty fully for the first time. She was truly delicious. I pulled out for a moment, and she gasped in protest, only to disappear when I pushed her down on the grass, hovering above her just a moment to enjoy her mussed-up hair and glowing face before slipping inside her, launching a merciless assault that would have alerted half of the forest if it wasn’t for the silencing wards. </p><p>“Harder, faster!” she murmured deliriously even as I slammed. Since I was a thoughtful gentleman, I decided to follow her desires to the letter, and slammed in her even harder, rough enough to make it very hard for her to walk without a healing charm afterward. Her only response was to tighten even more around my girth, elevating both of our pleasure at the same time. </p><p>I could feel my magic following the pattern as I slammed hard, injecting another fresh dose with every slam, coiling around her magic as it slowly infused with hers. However, wrapped in the tightest sensation I had ever felt, pulling out was an impossibility. Not exploding early enough to make her earlier mocking statement true was the most I could do. Her first time deserved better. </p><p>“How about this?” I asked as I continued slamming while bringing one of my hands to her hips, and spanking hard. </p><p>“Oh, yeah!” Lillian moaned loudly, proving that I wasn’t the only one that was lost in the moment. Just as I wanted to invade her and make her mine, she wanted to be annexed. “I want more!”</p><p>I could feel her magic. She wanted to be mine, utterly and completely. </p><p>“As you wish,” I said as I forced myself to slam even harder, every beat hiding my full length inside her, accompanied by an even-greater surge of magic. When I put my free hand on her breast to dig into her supple flesh and occasionally twist her nipples, I only met with a moan of desire. She opened her mouth once or twice to say something, only to melt in another cry of pleasure.  </p><p>Seconds rolled into minutes as we danced in an animalistic haze, only for her to moan. “Make me yours, fill me,” she said. </p><p>It was an order that was impossible to resist. I exploded, filling her not only with my seed, but also with a raging wave of magic that enveloped her whole body. She moaned deliriously, her eyelids fluttering, but she found enough strength to grab my shoulders and pull me to another kiss, her legs wrapping around to keep me in. I collapsed above her, gently pushing back and forth as I waited for her trembling to subside. </p><p>As we lay, I managed to get a semblance of control over my magic, and started examining the changes in her body, only to see no changes at the first glance, one that would make me think that I hallucinated if it wasn’t for the subtle sense of connection I was feeling, like I could find her even if she was at the other end of the world. </p><p>“Well, that happened,” she murmured after five minutes, still barely able to speak more than a whisper. I could have asked her whether she was comfortable with the decision, but chose to steal a gentle kiss off her cheek. “I’m happy,” she murmured. </p><p>“Good,” I said even as I moved down, stealing a kiss off her neck while making her shiver. “Because we’re going to do that a lot of times.” </p><p>“How about we start it now?” she suddenly said, giving out a crystal laugh as she suddenly forced me to flip, and we ended up in a beautiful cowgirl position, my cock once again hard inside her.</p><p>“We’re going to be late,” I reminded her, but a wide smirk. </p><p>“They can wait,” she answered as her hips started moving, and my magic started to rise once more…  </p>",

    "content": "<p>It took quite a bit of willpower not to explode an amused cackle as I watched Aria trying to heal me with intense concentration, required to infuse my body through the chains. Her blush was ever-present, not that it was surprising after what we had gone through. </p><p>While she was distracted with healing me, I was trying to come to a decision on just how far I should be pushing her. The safest thing to do was to let it be the end of the day, but seeing her amazing body, clad only in a corset —one that was stained with my cum, even— made it very difficult to resist that siren’s call. </p><p>I was going to test her limits, I decided. </p><p>Luckily, the healing spell was both going to take a lot of time, and distract her appropriately, giving me enough time to arouse her, to the point that she needed to solve it. The most obvious thing to focus on was her amazing bosom, the sight that I was dying to experience. Another simple telekinesis spell loosened her top, this time even more than the previous time, making her corset slid down, finally passing the line created by her erect nipples as it slid down. </p><p>I paid momentary attention to her face to make sure she was still fully committed to the spell before I turned my attention to her curves, which was perfection itself. Her breasts were a miracle, managing to maintain a perfect shape that signaled their perkiness despite their amazing size, filling me with a desire to taste it completely. Pity that I couldn’t count on her distracted state enough to free my hands from the chains. </p><p>Still, that didn’t mean that I was without options. Telekinesis spell once again came to my aid, and I started caressing her breasts with my magic. My touch was soft, just enough to register through her senses, but faint enough to slip her distracted attention. Her body started to react under my touch. Nothing extreme at first, just a bit of blush, a subtle shuffle as she looked for a more comfortable position, a sigh that lasted a touch longer than normal… </p><p>She was spectacular. </p><p>However, she wasn’t the only one that was feeling restless, I realized with a sudden shock. My body was absorbing the healing energies she was producing, but unlike the previous times, I had no injuries for that healing energy to cure, therefore exhaust herself. My body did the next best thing, and started restoring my stamina and temporarily strengthen my body in all aspects. </p><p>Including my sex drive. </p><p>That was a miscalculation, I realized as my boner turned rock hard, throbbing painfully, begging for a release. It wasn’t to a point that I couldn’t ignore, but the sight of Aria’s amazing tits wasn’t making it any easier. Not to mention her weak personality, which made pushing for more possible, if a bit risky. A risk I decided to take. I decided to use shock as a tool to imbalance her. “You have amazing tits,” I told her even as I stopped magically caressing her tits. </p><p>“Thanks-” she said absentmindedly before she came to a sudden stop, stopping her magic even as her head dipped down. “What! How!” she cried in shock even as she pulled her corset up, both of her arms around her chest as additional protection while she stumbled back. </p><p>“Its lacing was probably strained when you leaned forward, making it loose,” I explained calmly, not bothering to hide my smirk as I watched her blush bloomed once more. </p><p>“Why didn’t you warn me,” she whispered accusingly, though her words once again lacked any weight behind them. </p><p>“Should I have?” I answered, deciding to double-down. “After all, not only you have seen me naked, but also molested me while I was chained to a wall. I don’t think the small glimpse I had in return was unfair, was it?” </p><p>A more composed person would have easily pointed out that I was the one that volunteered to be her test dummy, therefore she was under no obligation to even consider paying back, but Aria lacked the confidence to point out that issue, probably even failing to think that. “But-” she started, making a half-hearted attempt to defend her position, only to wilt under a determined glare. “I …  I guess not…” she added in a murmur. </p><p>“Exactly. Now, why don’t you sit down and continue healing me,” I said. When she tried to reach back to fix the lacing, all it took was a shake of my head to dissuade her from that particular activity. She once again sat down in front of me, her hand still on her corset as she tried to keep it in place. “Just so you know, you have nothing to feel ashamed of. Your body is simply spectacular. Lancelot is going to love it when he finally sees you naked.” </p><p>“You think so,” she murmured guiltily at the reminder that she had a fiancee, making her push her corset even tighter to her body, just as I wanted. Mentioning her fiancee and crush at this point might have sounded like a bad idea, but it was a part of my plan. She was already feeling aroused and ashamed and shocked at the same time, adding guilt to the mix made her even more confused, which made her even more vulnerable to my suggestions. </p><p>“Of course, look at my cock, it’s already rock hard again after getting a glimpse of your beautiful bosom,” I explained while she pointedly avoided my gaze as well as my body. I chuckled. “You can look. It’s not like you haven’t seen it before,” I explained. </p><p>After my permission, her reluctance lasted only a moment before her eyes fell down, locked to my shaft, which was still glistening with the after-effects of her latest treatment, which had ended just minutes ago. “It’s ready again? This quickly?” she asked, curious. </p><p>“Honey, your beauty is enough to resurrect the dead,” I answered, earning a shy smile as a reward. I was ready to pounce on her weakness. “Why don’t you let that corset drop so that I can enjoy your beauty a bit more,” I reminded her. “You wouldn’t be cruel enough to deny a poor prisoner such a small wish, would you?” </p><p>If I were a weaker man, I would have exploded the moment a weak whimper escaped her mouth that signaled her acceptance. Her surrender was beautiful, especially when she didn’t lower a flag but her own corset to signal her surrender, giving me an excellent glimpse of her bosom, which was heaving as she breathed deep. “Are you happy?” she countered, a small bite in her tone, once again signaling a token resistance. </p><p>“Words can’t describe my happiness,” I said smugly. “But that doesn’t mean my lips can’t. Lean in!” I said, the last two words delivered with an aura of leadership —enhanced by a touch of magic— one that I perfected during my reign as a Dark Lord, signaling my expectations for absolute obedience, promising darkness for anyone that dared to reject the order. </p><p>Even under the best of conditions, Aria would have struggled to resist such a pure demand for obedience. Confused, half-naked, shivering, aroused, and stained with my cum, she was far from her best condition. It would take a miracle for Aria to actually reject that call to action. </p><p>And that miracle rejected to descend. </p><p>She leaned forward, her lips trembling, shock dancing in her beautiful blue eyes. I was happy to note that fear wasn’t the only thing I could see in her eyes. Along with fear, there was arousal, begging to be roared further, something I was more than happy to do. Our lips met once more, but this time, it wasn’t a tender kiss. No, this time my tongue darted out, invading her mouth mercilessly, while her own gently wrapped around mine, surrendering to my aggression immediately. </p><p>Her submissiveness made me even more aroused. I cursed the fact that my hands were still chained, preventing me from running my fingers through her hair before grabbing them painfully. Instead, I delivered a gentle bite to her lower lip to compensate, making her moan beautifully, delivering an exquisite mixture of arousal and pain. “Grab my cock, and start pumping,” I ordered, something she followed immediately even though her touch was still hesitant. </p><p>The next few minutes passed in that kiss, but whenever we pulled back for a breather, her reticence was smaller, and her arousal was thicker. It was the time to take yet another step. When she leaned forward for another kiss, I stopped her. “Bring your tits to my face,” I ordered her. She looked hesitant, but followed my order nonetheless, and I found myself facing one of the most spectacular bosoms —maybe even the most spectacular one— I had seen in my life. They were perky, pale, and pristine, like a pair of holy mountains covered with pristine snow, beautiful enough to worship. </p><p>However, I was a Dark Lord, and my instincts worked differently. I didn’t want to worship them. I wanted to make them mine. And what better way to do that than leave my mark, I decided even as I gently bit those peaks, despoiling her soft skin for the first time in her life. The bite wasn’t strong, just enough to leave a faint mark, but she responded with a loud moan, one that surprised both of us. </p><p>Her sensitivity surprised me, but it was a pleasant surprise. Immediately, I attacked her breasts with a mixture of kisses, licks, and occasional bites, filling her tits with bite marks and hickeys, evidencing my invasion. Oh, how I wished my hands were free. Pity that she wasn’t far along enough to handle my freedom. </p><p>As seconds merged and created minutes, she started responding to my assault in a more visceral way. Her moans rose at first, filling the cell with the most beautiful sound it ever witnessed, while her hands around my shaft quickened, dancing up and down in a perfect rhythm that proved her proficiency as a student. </p><p>Just as I was getting into the mood while she started to show signs of an impending climax. I didn’t stop, and she lacked the presence of mind to actually pull back, though maybe it was a conscious decision on her part. After all, her loud moans weren’t exactly conveying pain and desperation. </p><p>When she collapsed to her back, shuddering helplessly, I had a smug smile on my face. After all, bringing a woman into completion while chained to a wall was not a simple achievement. However, I was surprised when she opened her eyes, only to look at me, shocked. “You - you can use magic!” she said in shock. </p><p>A hint of panic appeared in my heart, but I suppressed it. I hadn’t used any magic during the last several minutes, so she either misunderstood something, or something finally clicked about my previous activities. If it was the latter, it would have been rather inconvenient, but it didn’t seem likely. I decided to probe her first before committing to a position. “What do you mean, sweetie?” I asked lazily. </p><p>“You … magic…” she gasped as she tried to control her breathing. “I’m feeling different. It must be magic.” </p><p>I chuckled when I realized what she was talking about. “Thanks for the compliment, sweetie,” I said with a large smile, only for her to look even more confused. “Have you never had an orgasm before?” I asked. </p><p>“I…” she murmured. “No…” she said, letting her words linger, while my smile widened even more. </p><p>“You’re welcome,” I said smugly, even though I couldn’t help but feel astonished about just how sheltered she was. I know she had no experience with a boy —or a night of mutual assistance with a girl— but the fact that she hadn’t masturbated before was a surprise. I took a note to bring that up later. Watching her fumble as she tried to pleasure herself would no doubt be a spectacular show. “What you experienced is the reason why people are obsessed with sex.”</p><p>“So, that’s how people feel every time they…” she said, unable to say sex, which was rather funny considering her tits were out, covered with hickeys.  </p><p>“Well, not every time,” I answered. “At the risk of blowing my own horn, not every male is capable of helping a woman experiencing this peak. Certainly not every time.” She was unable to reply to that, still trying to process what had happened. “Honey, why don’t you continue working while you rest. I certainly don’t want to be interrupted halfway again. I don’t think I can handle waiting for a whole night this time.” Especially since there was no guarantee that Emma would pay another visit to my poor abode. </p><p>“Okay,” she said as she leaned forward, her tits dangling forward beautifully while she reached for my shaft. “Not like that,” I warned her, and she looked confused. “I want you to use your tits,” I said. There was no chance that I would miss a titjob opportunity from her spectacular breasts. </p><p>It was proof of the progress we made —and possibly the still-present haze from the orgasm that she barely said anything when she leaned forward obediently and wrapped my shaft in the soft embrace of her breasts, immediately starting to move up and down. I said nothing as I leaned against the cold wall, enjoying the delicious massage of her tits, simultaneously amused by her firmly-shut eyes while her hands pressed against her breasts from both sides, tightening her grip. </p><p>“We need some lubrication,” I reminded her, which was enough for her to open her mouth. She loosened her grip, but I interjected. “Keep your hands still,” I ordered, not bothering to modulate my orders. She looked at me questioningly. “Spit on it directly,” I reminded her. “It’s not far away from your lips, after all,” I added, reminding her that the crown of my shaft was just inches away from her beautiful lips. I was tempted to ask for a small kiss, but I managed to hold myself back. It might be too much for her even now. </p><p>She stilled as she tried to process my request, once again amusing me with her selective shyness. Apparently, spitting on my cock was something more scandalous than giving me a titjob. She looked at me pitifully, but it found no purchase, only seeing a demand for obedience. She closed her eyes even as she dipped her head, trying to hide her lips with the angle before spitting on my shaft a couple of times, lubricating it generously. “Is this okay?” she asked even as she moved once more. </p><p>“Good enough,” I said with a chuckle. “If you don’t want to do that, don’t forget to bring some massage oil the next time,” I reminded her. She nodded, taking the mention of a next time with stride, something I was very happy with. </p><p>Since she was being such a good sport, I decided to give her another small gift. Once again I started massaging her breasts with my magic, this time the effect even more pronounced. I was willing to bet that between the sensation she was getting from my shaft and her own squeezing, she wouldn’t be able to distinguish the external influence, especially with her jumble of emotions taking a big toll on her. </p><p>Regardless, I started slow, letting my magical touch caress her breasts softly, focusing on her rock-hard nipples. She bit her lips desperately, but she was helpless against the reflection of the moans on her eyes even if she managed to control her mouth. Even the latter didn’t survive for long, breaching her hurried attempts to barricade, echoing against the walls once more, focusing more and more on the moment. Her own growing arousal ruined her attention even more, which got even worse once another orgasm hit her, leaving her shuddering. </p><p>Trying to ride the euphoria of her own climax was a good reason why she once again missed the signs of my explosion, this time directly against her face, corrupting her beauty with my spunk, which somehow made her even sexier. She was too shocked to move, frozen, unable to process the rush of emotions mixing with the aftermath of an orgasm while I continued to cover her face with my seed. </p><p>As I looked at her, there was only one question in my mind. What should I do next? </p>",

    "content": "<p>Despite the exhilarating experience of tricking about a couple of centuries worth of experienced legionaries —as far as I could tell— I was not in the best of moods. Yes, the adventure had been much less exhausting than I had predicted, likely because stepping into the realm of a Sorcerer improved both my magical and physical abilities significantly —enough that I wasn’t tired after a twenty-four-hour chase where I had to continue casting repeatedly— but that didn’t mean I enjoyed wading through thick mud while suffering the rain, not using any magical solution to avoid detection. The rain only stopped a couple of hours ago, and the ground was still covered in mud, making it a very uncomfortable trek. </p><p>So, I was understandably miffed when I saw eight tribal warriors trying to strong-arm Aviada to leave Lillian to their tender mercy. </p><p>Still, despite the annoyance, I didn’t rush in immediately. I wanted to observe the situation first, because it was a good opportunity to understand the structure of my supposed ally. The fact that the escort they had sent had been harassing Astrid with clearly bad intentions about Lillian had put their reliability into question, but with the legionaries behind us, I didn’t exactly have a wide range of options. I observed to understand the reason for their actions. </p><p>There were multiple possibilities. The first possibility was it was an intentional order from Matron Helena, maybe to measure the loyalty of Astrid or understand my temper better. I would have been glad if that was the case, but unfortunately, the lecherous smiles on the faces of tribal warriors were hard to fake. They really had bad intentions. </p><p>So, it was a choice between an order from another leader, and the rogue action of their soldiers. Neither possibility inspired trust. I was either going to walk into a situation where an unknown number of warriors would be following orders from anyone other than my nominal ally and do their best to work against me, or I would face a camp full of barely-controlled horny warriors while escorting two sexy women. </p><p>I was tempted to kill them and write off Matron Helena as an ally. I would have probably done so if I knew that sending a cohort after me strained the capabilities of my enemy, which unfortunately wasn’t the case. I still didn’t have the slightest information about them. I needed allies, no matter how fractured or unreliable they were. </p><p>“Hey, don’t come near,” Astrid cried when two men separated from the group and walked toward them intimidatingly. Astrid stood near Lillian, raising her hand, which glowed threateningly. When the men didn’t stop, she let the spell fly, and a blue orb hit one of the attackers’ stomach, leaving him curled on the floor. </p><p>I was surprised, not only because Astrid didn’t even flinch before threatening her own supposed allies to defend Lillian, but also the spell she chose to do so. She had used a simple magic orb, one that every first-year student could cast because it was a simple but effective self-defense spell with little chance of accidentally killing the target. However, it was taught in Halls of Saturn, and definitely wasn’t something Astrid would know. </p><p>Nice, I thought. Apparently, rather than wasting their trip, Lillian was teaching Astrid magic, yet another sign of their growing relationship. However, I didn’t have the time to tease them about it, because the other attacker had raised his spear and shouted and charged. “You bitch! I’ll make your beg for death!”</p><p>The girls could have easily handled that, but the six men behind him —all lifting their own spears— was a different subject. They looked reluctant, clearly unhappy that things had devolved into this point, but at this point, things had devolved enough to push them into the fight. While Lillian was strong enough to take them, she lacked the practical experience to fight against multiple opponents. Moreover, I doubted she could do so without killing them, and I needed them alive. Killing even one would destroy my already fragile alliance with Matron Helena, no matter the reason. </p><p>“Can I help you, gentleman,” I said even as I waved my hand, and an earth barrier rose in front of Lillian and Astrid. Impressive, but nothing a mage —albeit a strong one— couldn’t do. The tribal warriors would have easily circled around the barrier since it was a half-circle, but they were smart enough to stand their ground and wait. </p><p>Well, almost all of them were smart enough to do so. The hothead that had been leading the attack turned his attention to me, his face drowning in anger. “Who are you, Roman fucker, and how dare you to interrupt me teaching a lesson to those bitches.”</p><p>I chuckled at his words as I walked closer, but Lillian tensed. She was familiar enough with me to realize there was no humor in my chuckle. “I’m guessing that you already know who I am, even sent here to escort me,” I said lazily as I closed in. “The question is, why are you acting like a rabid dog and ignoring orders despite the risk of failing the mission,” I smirked. “Your leader must be rather pathetic if he can’t reign a rabid dog like you.” </p><p>“You dare to insult Great Virato,” he shouted as he cocked his arm back, ready to throw his spear. “I’ll fucking skewer you.” </p><p>Two of his friends dashed toward him, clearly trying to prevent him from attacking, though I noticed one of them had a dismayed expression on his face when his angry friend shouted the name of his leader, which reinforced my assumptions about the fractured state of my allies. It was better than a camp full of uncontrollable warriors, but not by a huge margin. The angry one still threw his spear before his friends could prevent him, but I dodged it easily. She wasn’t exactly an excellent sharpshooter. “Ientius, stop!” called one of his friends, but realizing he was about to be manhandled, Ientius rushed forward, pulling his sword on the way. </p><p>I sighed and continued to walk, not bothering to cast a spell. Instead, I leaned back when he swung his sword, easily dodging his clumsy attack, before I stomped his shin. The cracking of the bone exploded in the opening. “Fucker, I’ll kill-” he shouted, but I silenced him with a punch that sent him asleep. </p><p>“Sorry about that,” I said as I continued to walk forward. Killing him not an option, as it would have been ruined the potential alliance, but there was no way I would let him get away after what he tried with my girls. The rest of the group watched me with wary eyes, and one of them gestured the rest to stay back. He was probably the leader. </p><p>“I hope you don’t take Ientius’ actions to the heart,” he spoke with forced calmness. He clearly wanted to make an issue of it, but my display of skill had been too overwhelming, showing that I was strong enough to cast a spell to immobilize all of them, not to mention my ability to take an armed and angry man without a weapon. They could still ruin this alliance by attacking, of course, but luckily, the leader looked smart enough to </p><p>“Pests will be pests,” I answered with a shrug, indicating my intent of not attacking as humiliatingly as possible. Since they went their own way to provoke me, I had no intention to accept their lazy excuse immediately. I said nothing until I arrived next to the girls, who were looking at me with relief. </p><p>“You’re back,” Astrid whispered in relief. Lillian said nothing, just grabbed my hand and squeezed hard, showing that she was affected by the threat of kidnapping. </p><p>I squeezed her hand while I turned my attention to Astrid and whispered. “Should we continue with the alliance, or the situation is different.” </p><p>“I don’t know,” Astrid murmured, hesitant. “We have only communicated through the letters, and the risk of interception was too big to share anything sensitive.”  </p><p>“Still, you know her better than I do. Give me your opinion,” I said. </p><p>“I think we should go,” Astrid answered. “The guys that attacked us are from the Audatus tribe. We have occasionally traded with them, but the relationship between our tribes was sporadic considering the great distance. Also, we don’t share the same culture. They are a Gallic tribe rather than a Germanic one.” </p><p>“So, we’re looking for a camp much bigger than the loyal warriors of your tribe,” I answered. When I considered the alliance with Astrid’s teacher, I wasn’t expecting to find myself in the middle of a tribal political quagmire. Still, it was better than blindly running away. Some spears between us and the legionaries were definitely welcome. </p><p>“Probably,” Astrid answered passionately. “I know the situation doesn’t look good, but she wouldn’t have asked me to come if things were truly grave. She must have a plan to guarantee our safety.” </p><p>“We don’t have a lot of options,” I whispered to her, before I turned to our escorts, who were busy crafting makeshift stretchers for their wounded comrades. “So, boys. Should we get moving?” </p><p>“Give us a minute,” answered their leader, clearly dissatisfied, but not willing to escalate. He didn’t ask our help to use magic to ease their suffering, and we certainly didn’t offer. </p><p>We started moving after five minutes. They walked in front of us, and we followed them, but made sure that we left a distance, something they were happy with. Neither group wanted a sudden break of violence. </p><p>An hour later, we stopped for a break. They had offered us food, and we kindly turned it down. I didn’t think they were stupid enough to try to poison us —and I had the skills to detect it— but it was more about underlining the lack of good feelings between the groups. Since they were at fault, I didn’t want to seem weak by forgiving them easily. Moral high ground was a good card to have even among the tribes. </p><p>“I have bad news,” I whispered to Lillian when we sat down and I cast a silencing ward. Since things had evolved into such a point, I decided to be more open to Lillian, because we couldn’t afford a mistake like trying to contact her family in a sudden desire. </p><p>“More bad news?” Lillian answered, her face contorted. </p><p>“Unfortunately,” I answered. “I still don’t know who your kidnapper is, but I’m sure that the Captain is not the ringleader, or a hired hand. Whoever requested it is strong. Strong enough to arrange the presence of two centuries following us.” </p><p>“That doesn’t sound too bad,” Lillian answered with a frown. “My family could certainly have a similar clout do so.” </p><p>“You’re missing the point,” I answered with a sigh. “Yes, your family can do it, even my uncle could do it, but only back in Britanium, at the seat of their power. And I doubt that even they can mobilize half-a-cohort for a personal errand. Certainly not in a week.” As I spoke, Lillian’s face lost her color. “I’m almost certain that we’re not in the center of our mysterious enemy’s power, because if so, he would have sent his personal forces.” </p><p>“Meaning we’re dealing with someone strong enough to influence legions in another territory,” Lillian completed. “Maybe someone in Rome?” </p><p>“Either that, or we’re dealing with a Governor of a territory.” </p><p>“My family doesn’t have a feud with anyone that strong. Why would they suddenly fight against us? And even if they did, they are clearly strong. Why would they need a hostage?” Lillian asked. </p><p>“They probably don’t,” I answered, making her eyes widen. “I’m starting to suspect that your kidnapping is less about your family, and more about something special to you. Maybe a unique trait, maybe some bloodline you receive from your family.” </p><p>“My mother,” Lillian gasped in shock. I quirked my eyebrow, and she explained. “My mother is the last member of a small family that was living on the coast, but her family collapsed. But since their hereditary traits were similar to some of our powers, my grandfather allowed her marriage despite her limited dowry. Maybe it’s about that?” Lillian offered. </p><p>“Might be,” I said, unable to let out a frustrated growl. I hated the feeling of being sieged, and after years of subtly building a defense against insurmountable odds —and succeed— I found myself in an even worse situation. My anger must have been apparent on my face, because Lillian flinched and pulled back, looking like she was about to cry. “I’m not angry at you,” I said even as I pulled her tight against my body, and kissed her gently. </p><p>She responded with a searing, desperate kiss of her own, her tongue conveying her relief. Understandable, because we have just talked about how she had a deadly enemy specifically gunning for her, so she probably feared that I would leave her. Luckily for her, despite everything, I was a stubborn bastard, and wouldn’t abandon her like that. “You’re my hero,” she whispered as she pulled back for a breather. </p><p>“Then why don’t you reward your little hero,” I said, blasting her with a crooked smile. </p><p>Her smile was no less naughty. “It’s a pity that we could be seen easily-” she started, only for a mist to surround us, cutting her words. </p><p>“How about now?” I answered even as I cast a couple more spells, one to clean our bodies simultaneously, getting rid of all the mud and grime, one to clean and solidify the ground we were sitting on. “We have twenty minutes before we started to move again,” I reminded her. </p><p>“Hmm,” she murmured naughtily, immediately making my shaft rock hard. It wasn’t surprising. If there was one drawback about my special Sorcerer ascension, it was feeling horny all damn time, getting higher more magic I used. I had no idea whether it was dangerous, but it was certainly uncomfortable. </p><p>However, Lillian was sexy enough to make me hard with a whisper even without that, so it was a moot point. She somehow managed to look sexy even wearing very practical and baggy travel clothes, without any makeup, and her hair gathered in a simple ponytail. “Anything special for your reward, milord?” she asked throatily. </p><p>“No, my dear damsel,” I answered. “You’re the one in control, feel free to act as you desire.” </p><p>“Interesting,” Lillian gasped in a way I liked very much, and leaned forward, her hands grasping the edges of my pants before freeing it. “Someone is very enthusiastic,” she said. I was about to answer, when she pressed her fingers to my lips. “Silence, we don’t have much time,” she said in a surprising show of initiative, amusing enough for me to let her get away with it. “Let me show you my appreciation better than words can portray.” </p><p>I wasn’t surprised when her mouth closed around my girth with great enthusiasm, though the dance of her tongue was enough to force a moan off me.</p><p>However, her next action was definitely surprising. She took a deep breath before suddenly pushing herself down, easily able to swallow half of my shaft with one move. And even better, she kept her beautiful blue eyes open as she did so, maintaining eye contact. “Excellent start,” I commented, and her hands tightened on my thighs, using her grip to swallow my length even deeper, the crown slipping to her throat bit by bit, her gagging making me glad that I had included a silencing charm to the deal.  </p><p>I enjoyed the feeling of her tongue when she pulled back for a breather. “Such a beautiful reward.” </p><p>“You haven’t seen anything yet,” she said, pulling out momentarily before pushing herself even deeper, forcing herself to my shaft. And when she failed to swallow all, she surprised me further by casting a spell to push herself deeper, until her nose was touching my skin.</p><p>“Such dedication,” I said gleefully. “Honey, you’re definitely a damsel that deserves to be saved.” She didn’t pull back to answer, but the shine in her eyes reflected her happiness to my compliment. As I looked at her, I struggled to imagine just weeks ago, she was yet another bitchy noble who thought she was above everyone else. And now, she was here, enthusiastically gobbling my cock to reward me, which, I had to admit, was an excellent way to remove any lingering resentment. I was definitely happy to forgive the rest of our graduating class if they were to be half-as-enthusiastic, though the male half needed to ask their sisters or cousins to help them —or mothers, if they were still particularly hot. </p><p>I reached to Lillian’s body, ready to touch her body, only for her to slap it away. Apparently, she wanted me to stay passive during her treatment, not that I had any problems with that. I continued to stay passively while she forced herself to swallow my full length repeatedly, pushing me closer and closer to the explosion, the tightness of her throat massaging the tip of my shaft aggressively.</p><p>I was getting close, and while I could keep myself back, I decided to reward her enthusiasm. “I’m about to explode, sweetie,” I said. “Blink once if you want me to warn you before, and twice if you don’t.” </p><p>I smirked when she blinked twice, then leaned back and silently enjoyed the treatment she was delivering, occasionally pausing for breath. Since she had asked for it, I didn’t give any warning other than a sudden throbbing in her mouth before I exploded, filling her mouth. Shockingly, she managed to get all of it easily, then gave me a dirty smile before gulping down like she was not a noble scion but a back-alley tramp. Not that I had any problems with that, of course. </p><p>“Amazing reward, honey,” I said as I caressed her cheek while she pulled a gourd of water to clean her face and mouth. </p><p>“No,” she said with a sudden smirk as she closed in the distance once again, already unbuttoning her shirt. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I let my hand slip down to Tiffany’s ass as we entered the bar, which, considering her short dress, was rather obscene. I didn’t care about being seen because of the special design of the place, which was geared for absolute privacy, even at the entrance. The hotel didn’t explicitly say it, but it was clear that the place was designed for people having extramarital affairs, allowing them to enjoy a semi-public space without fearing to be seen. Each group had their own booth, with absolutely no visibility between them. </p><p>Perfect place to seduce a shy half-Asian beauty. </p><p>A beautiful waitress greeted us, not even blinking at our closeness. We followed her, while I slipped my hand under Tiffany’s summer dress, enjoying her curves. “I missed you,” she whispered. “It has been a while.” </p><p>“Occasionally, even I have to work,” I answered with a chuckle. “Luckily, we have several hours to ourselves.” </p><p>Tiffany chuckled as the waitress finally brought us to our booth and took our drink orders. “Don’t make promises you’re not intending to keep. I can see that you’re besotted with Umi. You’re going to neglect me again, aren’t you?” she said playfully. </p><p>“Not necessarily,” I answered even as I placed a small kiss on her neck. “Who says we can’t work on her together?” I suggested. </p><p>“Why do you think I would be interested in such a thing,” Tiffany countered, trying to provoke me, but with limited success. </p><p>“It’s a wild guess,” I murmured even as I let my hand trail down from her waist to her thigh before I took a sudden turn, climbing up her leg, underneath her skirt, until my fingers touched her panties, feeling her wetness. “And it seems that your body agrees.” </p><p>“You’re an evil old man,” she said as she giggled, while I continued to caress her thigh. She sighed. “But yes, I’m not against the idea of sharing that tasty geisha between us,” she said. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said, interrupting myself as I leaned down and stole a kiss from her elegant neck. “Actually, why don’t you text her and make sure she wears something more appropriate for the occasion. I’m sure her fiancee would be happy for your help.” </p><p>“Why not?” she said as she pulled off her phone, and sent a quick message to her. Meanwhile, I continued caressing her inner thigh to push her arousal further, but not pushing for more. I wanted her to panting and ready to go when Umi arrived, as it would make the situation even more interesting, with one trying to slow things down while the other trying to push things even more. </p><p>Even as I teased her, I watched her screen as she started a rapid digital conversation with Umi, starting soft at first to increase the sense of familiarity with the idea. Umi’s reluctance was obvious. Clearly, she was only doing that because her fiancee agreed, and her fiancee only agreed because he was too spineless to actually reject a ‘sensible’ recommendation from his direct boss Mike. </p><p>After five minutes of chatting, Umi finally mentioned that her fiancee left the room for a night of drinking along with Mike. Tiffany chose that moment to open the more important part of the discussion, namely, what she should wear for our little dinner. At Tiffany’s insistence, she started sharing pictures of her evening wear, unfortunately by laying the clothes on her bed rather than trying them on. A true pity. </p><p>“Damn, is she a nun?” Tiffany murmured after she shared three conservative dresses with ankle-length skirts consecutively, finally writing a reply that asked her to dress more revealing. </p><p>“Don’t be so shocked. She was clearly raised in a conservative household,” I said. “But I’m sure you can convince her to be a bit more adventurous.” </p><p>“Is there a reward for doing so?” she asked, her ruby lips curling suggestively. </p><p>“What do you have in mind?” I asked. </p><p>“I remember seeing a magnificent pair of shoes recently, and they have a franchise here. Unfortunately, they’re a bit expensive for my dear husband’s budget, even with the recent bonuses.” </p><p>“How much?” I asked. My eyebrows quirked when she whispered the price into my ear. “Not bad, at least not expensive as a car,” I said with a chuckle. I asked, because I had learned my lesson after offhandedly making the same promise to Elena about a dress after she helped me to convince the wife of a business partner, only to set me back mid-five-figures. “I agree, but I have a condition of my own,” I added. </p><p>“What do you have in mind?” she gasped even as she wrote another quick reply to Umi, trying to convince her to wear a white sleeveless blouse. It was not exactly revealing, but I could see what she had in mind. The buttons on the front meant that we could bargain her about her cleavage the whole night. Important, since I wanted to taste those spectacular breasts. </p><p>“I want to come with you to the store, so you can model for me in them, and maybe only them,” I answered, catching her lips in a searing kiss as she parted them. </p><p>“Naughty,” she answered. “I might do so if the store is empty. And worst case, we will have the dressing cabin.” </p><p>“Excellent idea,” I murmured as I focused on her neck once more, creating a trail of kisses while she tried to convince Umi to wear a short skirt, but failed in that effort. Still, she managed to convince her to wear a pair of skinny jeans, a nice consolation price under the circumstances. I pulled back when Umi sent a message telling that she would arrive in a few minutes, giving Tiffany enough time to fix her attire, not wanting to scare our guest immediately. </p><p>We were sipping our drinks when Umi walked in, accompanied by a waitress. Since I was a part of the decision-making process — through Umi was unaware of that particular fact — I wasn’t surprised by what she was wearing, but I was surprised by the way she filled the chosen clothes. Her white blouse was tight enough to strain the buttons in front of it, looking like it was about to collapse in one wrong movement. However, the generous size of her breasts was not a surprise, since even with the conservative dress earlier, they were apparent. </p><p>Her smooth legs, easily slipping into her tight jeans was a nice surprise, especially since her ass was still wide enough to rival her breasts. I couldn’t help to dig my fingers into their wide expanse. </p><p>“Good evening, sir,” Umi murmured. I was about to correct her, but then the idea of a shy half-Asian woman constantly calling me sir was too tempting to pass. </p><p>“Good evening, sweetie,” I answered. “Any preference for a drink? Maybe a cute cosmopolitan?” </p><p>“White wine, please,” she murmured as she moved to sit next to Tiffany, only for Tiffany to gesture her to sit on my left. I acted unaware of that little exchange, looking occupied with the menu, and ordered a few starters as well to fill our stomach. I was hungry after spending all that energy with Jenny, and needed some refreshment if I were to satisfy my other redheaded acquaintance as well as my surprise brunette friend. </p><p>“So, Umi. Tell me, how do you like the be part of our corporate family,” I asked directly, before she could ever have time to get over the fact that she needed to sit next to me while she flirted with me. </p><p>“It’s - wonderful,” she managed to say after a small pause. “The hours are good, and the pay is satisfactory. My husband loves his job a lot.” </p><p>“Excellent,” I answered even as I brought my gaze to her face, making sure our eyes connected before letting it trail down her neck, getting the glimpse of her modest cleavage before climbing up. “I’m happy to see the happiness of my team. Some people would complain about their partners constantly traveling. I’m happy to see that you’re not one of those.” </p><p>“Thank you, sir,” she murmured, unable to prevent her blush against my explicit attempt of enjoying her sight. </p><p>“So, how do you fill your long nights when your fiancee is away. Any hobbies?” I asked, once again pushing forward rather explicitly. Since Mike had sold me as an old-fashioned powerful boss, I had no problems playing that particular role, curious how she would react against my authority. She was giving major submissive vibes, and I was curious about the extent of it. </p><p>She murmured a response, so low that I was unable to hear. “Speak louder, sweetie,” I said, my sharp tone compensating for the softness of my words. “The class needs to hear from you.” </p><p>“Sorry, sir,” she murmured, her eyes pointing at the ground, not unlike a student who just received an admonishment from her favorite teacher. Maybe it would be even easier than I first thought. Her answer was cut short when the waitress came with her drink and the food. While the waitress placed the orders, Tiffany typed a quick message to Umi, while tipping the screen low enough that I could read it from the corner of my eye. She told her to use the opportunity to flirt a bit to get a better bonus for her fiancee, that it was the whole point of their presence. </p><p>Umi’s reaction to the message was frustration. Rather than saying anything, she reached for the glass and drank most of her wine in one long sip, seeking courage in the bottom of the glass. “Hmm…” she murmured, giving her some time to put together a response. “Nothing much,” she answered in the end. “I don’t have a lot of friends, so I usually stay inside, mostly relaxing in a bath,” she answered, her blush intensifying with each word. The fact that she was referring to her naked state, even indirectly, seemed to hit her limit.  </p><p>“That’s a nice image to remember when I’m back in my room,” I said with a chuckle. </p><p>Tiffany joined in the discussion while Umi dipped her head down even lower, trying to process the implication that I would be imagining her naked. “Come on, Nathan,” she said as she gripped my bicep. “Aren’t you going to ask me the same question? I’m beginning to feel neglected.” </p><p>“My bad, sweetheart. Tell me, what do you do when you’re alone.” </p><p>“Umm…” she suddenly murmured, something that was very much against her personality, making me wonder what she had in mind. “Do you mind if I run my answer through Umi first? I’m not sure if it’s appropriate,” she added, and I smiled knowingly. Even as she left the booth, I noticed her subtly pulling her dress higher, displaying more of her beautiful legs, her hips dancing erotically with each exaggerated step, something Umi also noticed if her shocked gaze was any indicator. </p><p>When Tiffany sat next to Umi and started whispering, I was afraid that Umi was about to faint in shock. She was definitely showing the signs of it, her blush thickening as Tiffany continued to whisper, and when she finally pulled back, Umi glowed as bright as a lamp. “What do you think?” Tiffany asked. “Can I share that?” </p><p>“I … don’t think so,” Umi murmured shyly. </p><p>“Really,” Tiffany said with a crystal laugh, making a point of putting her hand on Umi’s thigh as she chuckled, but didn’t pull her hand away when she stopped laughing, squeezing tight instead. “Sorry Nathan, my story had been vetoed.” </p><p>“It’s a pity,” I answered with an exaggerated sigh while I turned my gaze back to Umi, enjoying the way she squirmed under my gaze. “So, do you mind summarizing the story in a PG manner?” </p><p>“I rather not, sir,” she murmured, but her determination folded quickly under my sharp gaze. She turned to Tiffany, only to receive another encouraging squeeze while Tiffany’s hand climbed higher on her thigh. “She mentioned that… She spent a lot of time taking baths as well, but also with a massage wand.” </p><p>“Interesting, but I don’t see why it’s an appropriate story,” I said, acting dense. </p><p>Umi looked frustrated, unable to answer, while Tiffany laughed and cut it. “That’s because you have never seen me getting a massage. I can be … expressive when receiving a massage.” </p><p>“How interesting,” I said. “I’m not a bad masseuse myself, why don’t you come here and show me just how expressive you can be while getting a massage,” I said. Meanwhile, the waitress came with another round of drinks, and once again Umi grabbed her white wine, using it to drown her shyness. A very bad strategy under the circumstances, I noted. </p><p>“Why not,” Tiffany said and stood up, once again walking with a slow, deliberate eroticism. I was interested to note Amy’s eyes getting stuck on Tiffany’s beautiful legs, enjoying the sight. When she arrived back at my side, she sat inappropriately close, our legs brushing together, something that managed to shock Umi in the process. But her surprise was nothing compared to when Tiffany leaned down and removed her heeled shoe rather than turning her back. After removing her shoe, she slid back and put her foot on my lap, not particularly bothered by the way her dress climbed higher while she did so. </p><p>I put my fingers on the bottom of her feet, gently rubbing. It wasn’t the first foot massage I had given to her, so it was easy to identify her moan as exaggerated, though it was convincing enough to make Umi blush even more. I looked down, enjoying the sight of her beautiful leg while Tiffany continued to moan, the guttural sound enough to make my heart tingle. As a curvy redhead, she was the epitome of sexiness even discounting her impressive skills of acting. </p><p>I slowly worked my way up to her calves, then her thighs, each moan making Umi more uncomfortable, and she continued to rely on her wine to process that feeling, slowly getting tipsy. She didn’t seem to have a lot of resistance to alcohol, so when the waitress moved to refill our drinks, I gestured her to stop. Tipsy was nice, but drunk was not, especially for the first time. </p><p>“How was it,” I said as I pulled my hands away rather than continuing to her thighs. Not because I didn’t want to, or felt shy doing it, but because I was afraid of Umi running away. The last few moans had already pushed her to the limit. As Tiffany leaned to put on her shoe once more, I managed to whisper, asking her to have a private talk with Umi. </p><p>“That was nice,” Tiffany said relaxedly. “But I definitely need to refresh my makeup after this. Umi, would you like to accompany me to the bathroom?” </p><p>“S-sure,” Umi stammered as she jumped up to her feet, more than happy to take the opportunity to get away from the situation, and from her inquiring gaze, she intended to talk Tiffany about the limits of their ploy. </p><p>I leaned back, curious about the outcome… </p>",

    "content": "<p>I missed the promised meeting time with Aviada, so she wasn’t in her room —once again sneaking in through the convenience of illusion spells. The ease I was having sneaking around was a bit of a bummer, highlighting yet another problem with the security. Normally, I would have been happy with it, but the looming necromancer threat made me change my opinion. After centuries of safety, the school had become arrogant. </p><p>I just hoped that wake up call wouldn’t be deadly.  </p><p>While Aviada was not in her room, luckily she left a note about her location, saving me from making the effort to find her. After leaving the room, I dispelled the illusion and walked around as yet another warrior student —highlighting the lack of security and ease of spying even further— toward the small arena the students used to test themselves. As I arrived, the cries and jeers got louder, with no small amount of insults mixed in. </p><p>When I arrived, I wasn’t too surprised to see Aviada in the middle of the arena, holding a two-handed practice sword, trying to defend herself against three male students at the same time, each equipped with a sword and a shield, trying to flank Aviada, but failing to close in as she danced around while raining merciless attacks on their shields. I didn’t even consider stepping in because Aviada had a large smile on her face as she kept three people away, avoiding them with a grace she had lacked when we first met. </p><p>The boost she received to her Agility and Speed during the second-stage Companion process was showing its worth. </p><p>I watched as Aviada played with them for a bit until one of them made the stupid mistake of calling her a whore. A bad mistake, as not only did Aviada have an explosive temper, but she also wasn’t using her Strength stat to the limit intentionally. A war cry escaped her mouth as she lunged forward, swinging her sword with her full might. The first one tried to defend himself with his shield, only to find himself flying back, while his friend suffered the same fate a moment later. </p><p>“I didn’t mean-” the remaining one —who was also the one stupid enough to call her a whore— stuttered, only to be silenced when Aviada’s sword connected with his shin, the distinctive sound of a bone-breaking filling the opening. </p><p>“Anyone else want a challenge?” she called out angrily, only for the crowd to fall silent. Aviada threw her sword down and walked out of the arena. Aviada was by no means one of the top warriors in the school without her magical sword —at least not yet— but the stronger ones tended to avoid her challenges, afraid of their reputations even if they managed to beat her. Unlike the magic side, people of martial pursuits were usually sexist, which was part of the reason why Aviada was rather desperate to prove herself. Not to mention she didn’t have a lot of friends, hence her midnight hunting trips before we met. </p><p>I followed her as she walked towards one of the empty balconies that overlooked the arena, happy to note that it was a bit concealed. I followed her, only to realize I had a follower of my own.  A familiar curvy redhead was following her. It was her friend Carla, the one that I had been acquaintanced with rather memorably. She was trying to stay concealed as she watched me, no doubt still feeling rankled after the way I had picked to prove the lack of her observational skills. She was trying to avoid my attention, and her tricks were not half-bad. It was a pity that my perception was off-the-charts. </p><p>I acted like I hadn’t noticed her, and walked to the balcony Aviada was in. “You’re late,” Aviada said as I closed in. I would have been impressed by her perception if I hadn’t known about her ability to feel the presence of her sword. It was possibly the reason she picked a concealed balcony, allowing us to talk without getting too much attention. </p><p>“Sorry about that,” I answered. “But I wasn’t as lucky as I had hoped.” </p><p>“No prey?” she asked, surprised. Her surprise was justified considering I had been hunting alone in the night, which was a very active time period for hunting. </p><p>“The opposite actually,” I answered, which earned a curious glare from her. “Undead again,” I whispered, low enough to make sure Carla wouldn’t hear it. She opened her mouth, but I was faster. “Later,” I said, adding a warning glare to convey my seriousness. I definitely didn’t want to discuss such a sensitive topic where everyone could hear us. “Thanks for the sword, it helped immensely,” I said even as I passed it back to her. She visibly relaxed when her fingers wrapped around it, though I didn’t take it personally. The fact that she trusted me enough to lend her sword when I went for a midnight hunting session, making it very easy to steal it, conveyed her trust completely. Still, the sword was a big part of her fighting prowess, making its absence rather uncomfortable. </p><p>“Finally,” she murmured, not bothering to hide her relief. </p><p>“Do you have some free time?” I asked. “Maybe we could visit the crafter you mentioned before.”</p><p>“We’re a bit early for that,” Aviada said with a chuckle. </p><p>“Does she have a class in the morning or something?” I asked, only for Aviada to chuckle. </p><p>“She doesn’t wake up before noon, and she needs at least one hour for her hangover to pass. We should wait at least until dinner.” </p><p>“Did she have a party last night?” I asked. </p><p>Aviada laughed again. “I know that they had their weekly card game last night,” she said, laughing. </p><p>“And was it a particularly fun one, or was she celebrating,” I said. </p><p>“Drowning her sorrows for losing, no doubt,” Aviada answered. “She’s a rather poor gambler. Worse, she’s an enthusiastic gambler as well, making it easy for her to lose a lot of money. She usually uses fortified wine to drown her sorrows.” </p><p>“A gambler and a drunk,” I said, unable to hide the quirk of my eyebrow. “She sounds better and better. Are you sure she’s the best one?” </p><p>“Despite her faults, she’s good at her job. And she’s always in debt, so she’ll be open to your commission without asking too many questions as long as the payment is good enough,” she explained, sending me a dissatisfied smile, not enjoying my doubt. </p><p>“Okay, okay,” I said with a chuckle, raising my hands in mock surrender. “We’ll do what you say. But we should go early so I can cure her hangover. No harm starting our partnership on a positive note.” </p><p>“Smart,” she answered, then smirked at me. “We still have an hour. Why don’t we go back to my room, and discuss the rent you owe me for borrowing my sword.” </p><p>“No need, I like it here,” I said, and she frowned, reading my response as a rejection, which faded instantly when I stepped behind her, pressing my body against hers. “Don’t you think so?” I whispered. </p><p>“Do you think you can keep me here,” she replied, pushing her hips against my crotch even as she said so. I leaned forward, grabbing her wrists even as I pressed my lips to her neck. She tried to move her hands, using her full strength, only to fail spectacularly. But rather than feeling dejected, her arousal got even stronger, enjoying her own helplessness and my display of power. </p><p>I said nothing as she struggled, which included a lot of unnecessary repeats of her hips rubbing against my crotch. I said nothing, enjoying the treatment even as I cast a mirror spell to allow me to discreetly observe my back. Carla was standing in the shadows, her shock obvious despite her stealth, no doubt unable to process our daring. After all, all it would take was a curious glance from the crowd below to create a scandal. Neither her nor Aviada knew that I had already cast an illusion spell on the balcony to hide us from the view of the students below. I wanted Aviada to feel excited, but not at the expense of displaying her delicious body to a bunch of assholes. </p><p>It was the best of both worlds. </p><p>For a while, I kept Aviada’s wrists pinned against the railings while she continued to rub herself against me, waiting for her to get into the mood, which didn’t take long thanks to a combination of a rain of kisses to her neck, contrasting greatly with my rough grip around her wrists. “I’ll kill you,” she murmured when I forced both of her hands behind her back, but there was no hiding the desire in her tone. </p><p>“I wonder what I should do to prevent that,” I stated amusedly even as I weakened my grip. “Maybe I should let you go.” The angry growl she let out in response was simply beautiful. “Or maybe, I should teach you your proper place again,” I whispered. “You have a tendency to forget it.” She growled once again, this time impatient rather than angry. </p><p>I ignored the soft gasp that came from behind, realizing Carla was responsible for it. Her shock was understandable, as I was using my free hand to unbutton Aviada’s pants, feeling pity that she wasn’t wearing a skirt, which would have given me much more convenient access. Another gasp from Carla reached my ear when Aviada’s panties followed the destination of her pants, giving me an excuse to caress her legs. I pulled down my own pants with a simple spell, ignoring the discomfort. </p><p>[-1 Mana] </p><p>Then, I pushed inside her hard, still keeping her hands behind her back. My shaft slid in easily, my earlier rough treatment working wonders as foreplay, turning her sopping wet. Despite her best efforts, she moaned, struggling to stay on her feet as I ravaged her insides. I could have kissed her, as a method of silencing, but watching her struggle to keep silent would be much more fun. “Try to stay silent if you don’t want any observers sweetie,” I said as I leaned down to her ear. “Other than Carla, who is already watching us,” I added, this time using a spell to make sure Carla wouldn’t hear it. </p><p>[-2 Mana]</p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 73%] </p><p>“I’ll kill you,” Aviada answered, but there was no mistaking the arousal in her tone, not to mention the enthusiastic way she pushed her hips back whenever I slammed in, or the way her legs widened a bit to allow better access. She still struggled to get free, of course, but it only made her wetter. </p><p>Despite her best efforts, another moan escaped her mouth when my free hand slipped under her blouse, caressing her stomach slowly to contrast my furious slamming, making her moan repeatedly. “I can use a spell to silence you if you can’t handle it,” I helpfully offered, not bothering to hide the mocking edge in my tone, only to receive a threatening growl back. She pointedly stayed silent, amusing me with the ease I could tease her. She might have lost some of her prejudice toward magic, but that didn’t mean that she wanted to use magic to solve a challenge, however trivial. </p><p>I used another mirror spell to take a glance at Carla, curious about what she was doing, only to meet with a pleasant surprise. It wasn’t her shock, or the fact that her blush was deep enough to rival her beautiful red hair. However, when I noticed her legs were pressed together tightly, rubbing each other furiously, I smiled. Apparently, the concern Carla was feeling toward her friend’s ambiguous relationship didn’t prevent her from enjoying the show. </p><p>To her defense, it was an impressive show. </p><p>But since we once again had our familiar voyeur, there was no harm putting on a bit of a show. I let my hand climb upward under her shirt, revealing more and more of Aviada’s beautiful body, enough to reveal the functional bra she had been wearing underneath. I even changed our position slightly so that Carla would be watching us from the side, getting a much better view than what she had been seeing from our back. </p><p>Then, I conjured a rope, and tied Aviada’s hands behind her back. Thankfully, her dislike of magic didn’t extend to indirect effects. Then, I pushed her to her knees, forcing her down, grabbing her hair to keep her from collapsing. A flick freed her beautiful breasts from the oppression of her top. I started pushing inside her long and hard, though unfortunately, not hard enough to make the sound of our flesh hitting together explode. I could have used a sound-dampening ward, but it would have ruined Aviada’s challenge. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 74%] </p><p>“You like it, don’t you, slut,” I whispered into her ear, loud enough for Carla to hear. “You like it when I use you like a toy, putting you in your proper place under me.” </p><p>“You’re courting death,” Aviada answered between her squeezed teeth, which would have been scary if it wasn’t for the thick arousal coloring her every word. Staying silent was taking her full concentration. </p><p>“And what are you going to do about it other than obediently taking what I’m dishing out until you cum like a helpless slut,” I asked. “You even have your friend here to watch your humiliation,” I reminded her. Meanwhile, the friend I had mentioned was watching us with rapt attention, her fingers caressing her inner thighs over her pants. She clearly wanted to do more, but lacked the courage to do so. </p><p>“I’ll kill you-” Aviada tried to say, only for her body to betray her, climaxing explosively. Since she was such an obedient little girl, I let her get her reward, filling her up, just as a wall of notifications filled my sight. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 75% - Third Stage Completed +15000 Exp]</p><p>[Mana regeneration perk activated. Count 2. Duration, 8 hours]</p><p>[New Perk: Skill Share]</p><p>[Skill Share perk activated. Target Skill: Legendary Sword Mastery.

There had been a lot going on with the notifications I had received. The first thing I focused on was my own progress, of course, as it needed an immediate response. After a brief consideration, I chose Subterfuge, considering the rapid challenges I had been facing, faking a new personality wouldn’t exactly be a hindrance. Enhancing my melee abilities was tempting of course, but not at the cost of locking myself for the next five levels. My flexibility was the only reason I was alive, and I had no reason to change that. Specializing further by picking the Swordsman skill was definitely out, especially since I had already received such a welcome workaround. </p><p>The skill share perk was not a surprise after already experiencing it with Helga, but its application was still a bit surprising. After all, rather than getting a basic skill, I had received a master skill. I could already feel that skill connecting to my already existing Melee Mastery, suggesting that I could receive specialized skills in this manner. </p><p>Very convenient, I thought even as I considered the possibilities it presented with Elemental and Cornelia, as well as Biomancy and Marianne. It was potentially a huge power boost with seemingly no drawback. A bit inflexible as it needed planning, but considering its potential implications, very much worth it. More importantly, it had some very interesting possibilities for training. Even without swinging a sword, I could feel a flood of information filling my mind about how to be a better swordsman, some I was hoping to remember even after I lost the skill, though it needed further practice. </p><p>“I got a new-” Aviada started with a fascinated expression on her face, only to receive a warning glare from me. She was justifiably excited as she just received a new achievement. I checked her soul space, only to see it was very similar to what Helga had received during her third-stage completion, a two-point increase across all of her physical stats, to a total of ten points. Considering a lot of people would gleefully sell their mother, sister, and grandmother for ten stat points, I couldn’t fault her, but she should know better to discuss that when she was aware of the little voyeur. </p><p>There was a reason I was yet to reveal my leveling trick to her. </p><p>She visibly wilted under my warning glare despite her euphoria, which showed that despite all of her shows of resistance, she firmly accepted her position under me. I kissed her once more to bring her mood back up. I continued to kiss her, only to receive yet another notification. </p><p>[Achievement: Vivacious Voyeur. Intentionally let a little voyeur enjoy the show you’re putting on. +2 Perception. +500 Experience]</p><p>Amused, I raised my head, only to meet Carla’s gaze, whose hand had finally disappeared in her pants, and looking like she had just experienced an orgasm of her own. She froze, realizing she had been caught. “Do you want to join us for the second round, or do you want to keep watching?” I asked amusedly. Carla stood frozen for a moment, then dashed away without saying anything. </p><p> “She’s a bit shy for a peeper,” I said, and Aviada laughed. Then, I leaned in for a kiss even as I started pumping into her once more… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 24    Experience: 278800 / 300000 </p><p>Strength: 28    Charisma: 38</p><p>Precision: 21    Perception: 27</p><p>Agility: 25     Manipulation: 30</p><p>Speed: 23       Intelligence: 30</p><p>Endurance: 22      Wisdom: 33</p><p>HP: 2856 / 2856\tMana: 3792 / 3792        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Expert Arcana [75/75]        </p><p>Expert Subterfuge [50/75]         </p><p>Basic Speech [25/25]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p>",

    "content": "<p>I was expecting to be grumpy when Helga woke me up. After all, not only had I been up the whole night, but I had also gone through a rather harrowing and challenging evening filled with adrenaline. The total amount of mana I spent through the night had left its mark as well. If it wasn’t for my incredible constitution, I would have likely received a permanent injury from having strained myself. Even with that, my body was hurting, suggesting me to take it easy for the next day or two. </p><p>However, despite all, I woke up in a good mood, solely thanks to the method Helga chose to wake me up with. She didn’t poke me until I woke up, nor did she try to wake me up with a kiss. Well, technically, she was kissing me, just not my cheek or lips. No, I woke up feeling an incredible heat covering my crotch, giving me the most pleasurable alarm I had ever felt. I cracked my eyes open, only to see Helga’s blonde hair pooling on my lap while her head bobbed. </p><p>“That’s a beautiful alarm,” I murmured, still feeling the haze of sleep, one that I was in no hurry to dispel. After last night, I had earned the right to be lazy for a while before I had to meet with Aviada and gave back her sword. Helga said nothing, her mouth occupied with a task much more important than providing me with a pointless statement, but her hand tightened on my thigh to signal she had heard my statement. </p><p>She stayed there for another minute without saying anything, before she suddenly pulled out. Before I could say anything, however, I felt her tongue on my stomach, trailing my abdominal muscles as she climbed up, leaving a delicious trail behind until her lips reached my chest muscles, only to stay there for a while. I couldn’t help but snort softly. For all her explicit distaste toward warriors and their direct ways, she had no problems enjoying the benefits of the same track. </p><p>That snort earned a slap on the shoulder as she was smart enough to understand the root of that snort, but her annoyance was definitely not high enough to separate her lips from my body. Instead, she started moving back down once again toward my crotch while her hands caressed my biceps. Her tongue slathered lower and lower until it reached my shaft, which was starting to feel neglected. </p><p>Her grip around my biceps tightened suddenly, fingernails digging into my skin, but I barely felt a stinging sensation —inevitable considering the gap between my Constitution and her Strength. Still, combined with the warm sensation of her mouth engulfing my cock, it made me moan. I could actually feel the self-satisfied smirk that tried to appear on her face on my shaft. She was enjoying being the one in control. I pushed some mana through my shaft, rewarding her much better than a pat on the head. It was a good change of pace to lay back lazily while someone else did all the work once in a while, especially when I was still feeling the exhaustion from last night. </p><p>[-120 Mana]</p><p>Still, the sense of discomfort as I channeled mana was an unwelcome reminder of my exhaustion, like a muscle feeling pain after a long exercise. I decided to keep it down a bit. I had done nothing but lay with my eyes closed while the smell of arousal slowly filled the room, her movements getting faster and faster. It was good to have confirmation that I wasn’t the only one that was enjoying it. </p><p>She was clearly not in a hurry, because rather than pushing deep, her lips stayed around the head of my shaft, massaging me determinedly with the assistance of her tongue. I couldn’t help but feel that she had been practicing on some lucky vegetable while I was away. She was too obsessed with perfection not to do that, and her increase in skill was too pronounced. </p><p>“Holy shit,” I murmured, unable to keep my mouth closed after a particularly inventive swirl of her tongue. Her only response was to moan naughtily as she continued to tease the crown of my shaft. As much as I wanted her to quicken, I let her set the pace, not even guiding her by touch. After working hard, she deserved to deliver her show without interruption. </p><p>“You’re amazing,” I murmured as she moved deeper. She deserved every compliment I could give her. My cock was throbbing hard under the soft treatment of her pouty lips, beautiful enough to inspire a thousand artists. Her cheeks stretched out lewdly each time she descended on me, taking more and more of my shaft. The way her breasts softly rubbing against my thighs as she moved made it even more delicious. </p><p>She moved farther, but with torturous slowness, while my exhaustion slowly dispersed. Even the strain on my body lessened. While it didn’t disappear completely, it was still an amazing development. I would have said that it didn’t make any sense, but considering the rest of my leveling experience, I wasn’t exactly in a position to claim that. It was certainly more reasonable than helping the girls level up through a rough fucking. </p><p>I couldn’t help but feel disappointed when she pulled off of me, but her head stayed close to my crotch even as she smiled at me smugly, happy with the impact of her treatment. I smiled naughtily even as I let my impatience show, wanting to encourage her inventiveness. When she brought her lips close again, she didn’t wrap them around my girth. Instead, she started licking my length slowly, tasting and savoring the texture of every ridge and vein. Her lips occasionally wrap around the side of my shaft, delivering an interesting treatment from the side. At that moment, I couldn’t help but imagine Marianne on the other side, delivering the same treatment, their lips touching each other, occasionally even sharing a kiss. </p><p>I immediately added that to my mental bucket list to be done at the earliest convenience. Having two blonde beauties, delivering a combined massage was definitely something to be arranged later. “It’s becoming unbearable, honey,\" I moaned, signaling that I was nearing the end of my patience. Still, I let her continue at her pace rather than grabbing her head to initiate a rough deep-throating session. I liked the other girls, but Helga was my actual first, and she had a special place in my heart. Not to mention, the personality of the others didn’t allow for something like this. Marianne was far too skittish to actually take the lead, while both Cornelia and Aviada were too obsessed with power and control. Allowing them to control the pacing would have lowered their opinion about me at this early stage. </p><p>“Too bad,” she answered as she raised her head, giving me a naughty smile before lowering to continue the same treatment, doing her best to drive me crazy. </p><p>“You’re pushing your luck, you naughty bunny,” I said, but my tone stayed teasing rather than domineering. </p><p> She pointedly sucked me harder for a moment before pulling back, signaling that she had no intention of giving back control. Even when she pulled out and wrapped her fat tits around my shaft, moving up and down, her movements were pointed and deliberate, slowly moving up and down while her beautiful eyes stayed firmly fixed to mine, making the situation even more erotic. Her confidence was simply enchanting, especially when she still maintained her slow pace despite her own obvious growing arousal, signaled by her panting. </p><p>Then, without a warning, her grip tightened around my thigh before she lowered herself hard, so much that I felt her nose pressing against my skin while she devoured my full length with surprising ease, signaling that the vegetables she had used to practice with had seen some intensive usage. Not that I was dissatisfied with her assault, not when I could feel the tightness of her throat around my shaft, rapidly pushing me towards an explosion. I thought that to be the end of it, only for her to pull out at the last second. </p><p>“That’s a bit rude,” I said with a chuckle as she pulled out, leaving me throbbing and wanting. </p><p>“Don’t be impatient,” she answered as she stood up, giving me a glimpse of her body, wearing nothing but a pair of panties, her fingers already hooked around the edges. She started removing them slowly, bit by bit revealing her delicious entrance to my gaze, already sopping wet. “We still have the second round. </p><p>She took a long time removing her panties, and even longer as she turned her back, giving me a full view of her bountiful yet still tight ass. Soon, her entrance was pressing against my crown, perfectly positioning her for some fun time in reverse cowgirl position, about to entertain me with the excellent curves of her ass while she rode me. However, once again, she was very slow as she slowly lowered herself, her pussy as tight as ever. A moan rippled off her lips as the crown slipped in, forcing her tunnel to widen to accommodate my girth. </p><p>My cock was already throbbing as she impaled herself slowly, turning it into a truly delicious torture. On the positive side, it worked excellently to remove more of the strain I had been feeling after the last part. Another moan escaped her mouth, a rather artificial, practiced one that was designed for seduction. It worked nonetheless, but I continued to lay still, liking the anticipation of being served. As she lowered herself deeper and deeper, I let my eyes feast on her naked body and its beautiful curves, from the elegant curve of her back to the delicious view of her dangling boobs, most of it hidden by her own body, only a part of it peeking out deliciously. Her smooth, long legs were parted to the side, trembling slightly under the strain of maintaining the perfect angle, all crowned by the perfect lines of her heart-shaped ass. </p><p>“You’re a goddess,” I worshiped as she moved in a circular motion, riding me slowly but determinedly, adding more to my pleasure every passing second. I crossed my hands behind my head, raising my head just a bit to enjoy the show perfectly. </p><p>“And you’re a stallion,” she answered, unable to keep her gasps contained. “And I’m going to ride you slowly until you’re tamed and begging,” she added. I just smirked at the challenge, confident in my abilities —though I doubted I would share the same confidence if I hadn’t shared the bed of four different ladies in the last twenty-four hours, which went a long way in curbing even my voracious appetite. I doubted I could resist even half of it if I had been on a mission for a few days. </p><p>I was getting rather used to my new way of entertainment, after all. </p><p>Still, I didn’t bother to resist the desire to explode as it built up. Instead, it was Helga that stopped whenever my shaft started to throb noticeably, signaling another explosion. She had long become adept at recognizing the signs, pulling out just before my explosion was about to happen. She turned back to meet my gaze, a smug smile on her face, only to meet with my comfortable position. “You need to work harder to break this stallion,” I answered lazily, which roused her competitive spirit further. </p><p>“I’m going to show you,” she uttered in steely determination, waiting for a minute for my strain to dispel before lowering herself once more, this time slipping in much easier. Her circular motions got even slower as she brought me toward the climax. I was a bit late to my meeting with Aviada, but I wasn’t in a mood to care for being challenged explicitly. </p><p>Several minutes later, she stopped once more, but this time, I was yet to reach the edge. “Is there something wrong, sweetie?” I asked smugly. </p><p>“Shut up,” she murmured without bothering to turn, stopping for a moment, but it didn’t prevent her walls from tightening further. She wasn’t the only one that could read the other party, and considering my overwhelming stats and experience, I was able to do it much more efficiently. She was already tethering on the edge, and the small break she took was hardly a solution. When she started, she tightened even more. </p><p>When she pulled out once again, I recognized the sudden change in her mannerism, a sudden ride in aggression, mixed with some delicious anticipation. “Are you ready to-” I tried to ask, intending to ask whether she was about to surrender, only for her to silence me the fun way, by smothering me with her bosom. </p><p>“Shut up!” she repeated, even louder as she impaled herself with my erection once more and started to rock her hips, the sound of flesh hitting flesh exploding as she ramped up the aggression. Since it was impossible for me to say anything while smothered, I decided to put my mouth to better use, and started licking and sucking on her breast while traveling toward her nipple. Once I reached my destination, my teeth joined the game, gently biting her rock-hard nipple. </p><p>It proved to be the last step to push her over the edge, and she tightened around my shaft. Impressively, rather than slowing down, she picked up even more speed, her out-of-control cries making me glad for the judicious amount of silencing wards I had added to the protections of my room. “Someone is determined to break her stallion,” I commented in amusement when her back arched with pleasure, leaving my mouth free. </p><p>“Silence,” she ordered as she stuffed my mouth with her breasts —not that I was complaining— and continued riding me without giving an inch. My shaft was enveloped completely by her wetness, every push making me knock on her cervix like a particularly impatient visitor at the door. She was loud without the fear of being overheard. Really loud, enough to make my ears hurt, though I liked the feeling. It was good to see that I was able to break her even without moving a muscle. </p><p>“Finally,” she murmured in victory as I finally exploded, filling her insides, though her victory was tainted by the fact that she climaxed at the same time, allowing me to clinch victory as strong as she clenched around me. </p><p>[Achievement: Patient Participant.

Copied: Duration, 24 hours]</p><p>[Temporary Skill: Basic Mana Manipulation (25/25)]</p><p>The achievement put a smile on my face. The text was amusing, and while experience reward was completely negligible, extra stat points were always welcome. The temporary skill was also interesting. I could feel my mana getting even more flexible, which was always a benefit. However, the previous temporary skill I had received from her was lost, which, while expected, was a bit of a bummer. </p><p> She collapsed against my chest, her head snuggling into my neck. I laid under her —negligible— weight, enjoying the casual comfort of her touch as much as I enjoyed the high of a recent orgasm, proving that our relationship was evolving in an unexpected direction, not that I was unhappy about it.</p><p>“That was nice,” I murmured lazily while I gently extracted myself from under her. “Maybe next time, you can even give me a challenge.” </p><p>“Asshole,” she uttered as she slapped my naked chest, but it was impossible to erase her huge smile through fake annoyance, especially after a gentle kiss to her cheek. “What’s the plan for today,” she asked as she stretched in the bed while I used a water spell to clean myself, watching me with clear enjoyment in her eyes. </p><p>“I’m going to commission a new weapon,” I answered as I finished my quick shower and started dressing. I pointed at the sword. “Borrowing from Aviada is a temporary measure at best, not to mention it’s hardly hidden. I need something that fits better with my style.” </p><p>“Isn’t it a bit risky, you need to reveal yourself to yet another high-level person,” Helga asked as she tried to get her breath back. </p><p>“Not as risky as continuing to walk around without a weapon. Hopefully, I will be able to sell a bullshit explanation, or failing that, bribe the crafter for their silence,” I added. I lacked money, but that didn’t mean I was poor. Even after using most of them to set up the wards, I still had a decent amount of magical ingredients from last night’s encounter, especially if I added them to my existing stash. “You just stay here and focus on the wards, especially the weak areas they identified. If we know these locations, we can reinforce them in an emergency.” </p><p>After one last kiss, I left the room, dressed as a nondescript warrior, Aviada’s sword in its scabbard, an illusion on the pommel to make it look like a boring two-handed sword rather than the masterpiece it was.</p><p>I really needed a new weapon. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 23    Experience: 263300 / 276000 </p><p>Strength: 28    Charisma: 38</p><p>Precision: 21    Perception: 25</p><p>Agility: 25     Manipulation: 30</p><p>Speed: 23       Intelligence: 30</p><p>Endurance: 22      Wisdom: 33</p><p>HP: 2737 / 2737 Mana: 3588 / 3588        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Expert Arcana [75/75]        </p><p>Advanced Subterfuge [50/50]         </p><p>Basic Speech [25/25]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p>",

    "content": "<p>After my ‘discussion’ with Vradan’s spy, I decided to return to my room. Under the circumstances, I had already pushed my luck too much tonight, going as far as to leave the palace itself and going to the inner city. Any more, and the risk would become too much. </p><p>With that in mind, I sneaked back into the palace. Luckily, since it was already late, the lights in the corridors were dimmed, giving me the perfect opportunity to use my shadow magic to make myself effectively invisible. I was a bit afraid when it was the time to sneak into Emma’s room —not knowing about the other entrances yet— but my luck held strong, and when I picked the lock and entered, a soft singing was coming from her bathroom. </p><p>I tried to catch a glimpse from the keyhole, hoping that she was showering, only to see her buried in a sea of bubbles, hiding her body effectively. Pity, I thought as I opened the entrance of the secret passage. She owed me some sexy material after molesting me, thinking I was unconscious.</p><p>Still, I couldn’t help but feel a pang of annoyance as I returned to my cell. It was a bit ungrateful considering my previous condition, but I couldn’t help but resent the need to return back to my cell. Even with the ability to finally escape, I didn’t appreciate the need. I especially didn’t appreciate the oppressive feeling of the magic-blocking chains, even when they were damaged. I could remove them whenever I want, of course, but my magic still got somehow restricted as I wore them, giving me a claustrophobic sensation. Still, I managed to sleep… </p><p>Only to wake up to a pleasant view when I heard the creaking of the cell door as it opened. It was Princess Aria, wearing a simple dress which nonetheless failed to restrict her beauty. Even better, she was carrying a tray of food in her hands. As I examined it, the smell of it reached my nose as well. </p><p>“Good morning,” she said, barely above a whisper, as she looked at me. I smiled as I looked at the tray. “I brought you some breakfast,” she added. </p><p>“Thanks, you’re as kind as you’re beautiful,” I replied, which made her blush rather thickly. Meanwhile, my mouth watered, because, since my capture, I had been being fed by alchemical nutrition pills, which tastes as good as a piece of rotten wood, and during the last night, everything was too chaotic to stop for some food. “So, am I going to be fed by a beautiful princess’ hand,” I said, amused. </p><p>“Well,” she murmured as she threw a blanket from her bag and threw it next to me. “It’s not like I can let you eat yourself,” she added with a soft smile, though that little quip seemed to hit the limits of her courage, as she avoided my gaze afterward. </p><p>“Even if I promise to be a very good boy, listening to your every command?” I asked. </p><p>“Every command?” she repeated, her voice climbing high to join her blush. I just snickered at her reaction, not wanting to scare her off before she had the opportunity to warm up. I had my morning wood to do that for me, something she had noticed the moment she entered, but pointedly avoided gazing except a few quick ones when she thought I wasn’t looking. </p><p>She cut a small piece of buttered toast using a knife, and used a fork to bring it to my mouth with a motion more graceful than other people could achieve when dancing. I bit it, smiling slightly as I did so. “It’s delicious. Thanks,” I said, which was true. It was a simple breakfast, but I missed the opportunity to eat solid foods, not to mention that being fed by an actual princess made it even better. “But aren’t you going to be in trouble if others see it?” I asked, my tone of concern not entirely faked. </p><p>“No, no one else is going to visit today, they have more important things to deal with.”</p><p>“Good to hear that we don’t need to hurry to avoid another interruption, that would have been inconvenient,” I said, but even as I delivered it calmly, it didn’t prevent her frustration and shame. Understandable, considering she was in the midst of delivering a hand job when Emma had interrupted the last time. </p><p>“How are your injuries?” she asked after the lengthy silence I let linger, giving her an opportunity to remember what had been happening in vivid details. Or at least, that was what I assumed she was doing when she started to examine the walls with great detail, avoiding me pointedly. </p><p>“Not bad,” I answered. “The pain is almost gone, but deep breaths still cause a stinging sensation.” Of course, I had cured myself last night after I got rid of the chains. A mundane injury was a simple thing to cure without the chains, and I certainly wasn’t stupid around to run around all night with a dangerous injury. Luckily, with the chains on, Aria was unable to use her diagnostic magic, and had to rely on simpler ways to diagnose, something I knew well enough to fake. </p><p>“It’s good news, it means that we can finish the healing session today,” she said. </p><p>“We can,” I said with a shrug. “Or we can stretch it to two days and fill the time between with something more interesting,” I answered. </p><p>“W-what! No!” she stammered. “Not that!” </p><p>“Well, as you wish,” I said with a shrug. “I’m just trying to help, but if you’re going to be ungrateful about it…” I said dispassionately, letting anger linger in my tone just for a moment. </p><p>“Sorry!” she said immediately, too afraid of confrontation to resist even such a small, passive-aggressive rebuke from her prisoner. Lancelot really screwed up by letting his innocent fiancee hang around alone in my lair. She was like a poor little lamb trying to cook a vegetarian dinner for a wolf, an amusing but ultimately vain activity. Though, like the wolf in that story, I was very much happy about it. </p><p>I let her stew a few seconds before looking at her kindly. “It’s okay, but I don’t appreciate your tone when I’m the one helping you,” I said, once again twisting the situation to make her even guiltier. “It’s your call.” </p><p>“Please, I’m sorry,” she said even as she put her hand to my thigh and squeezed, a surprisingly forward physical action considering her demeanor. Even better, that action caused gaze to fell down to my shaft, reminding her of my raging arousal. She continued with a guilty whisper. “Did it stay like that the whole night?” she said. </p><p>“Don’t worry about it,” I answered, but put a slight strain in my tone, just enough to give the impression that I was bravely resisting discomfort just to spare her feelings. </p><p>“I see,” she murmured, looking at me confusedly before her expression took a steely expression. “No, it’s not fair for you too fell discomfort for my needs,” she said even as she grabbed my pants, and pulled them, revealing my shaft. </p><p>It took quite a bit of willpower from my end to prevent mocking laughter. Her words were nice, but her response had come too quickly, especially for her, meaning that I wasn’t the only one that was lamenting about Emma’s interruption —though Emma managed to earn my forgiveness by her idiotic lack of caution.</p><p> Her tongue darted out, slowly licking her lips in an effort to moisten them to combat her excitement, but her hand was quick to meet around my shaft, and even quicker as it started moving up and down. “You’re a good student,” I said even as I turned my gaze at her beautiful blue eyes. “You remember what I had told you about the pressure perfectly. Most girls struggle with that.” </p><p>“Most girls…” she whispered, her hand coming to a sudden spot. “Have you…” she tried to ask in an even softer tone, only to fade away. </p><p>“Well, you can say that a few would be an unfair classification,” I said. “But a gentleman doesn’t kiss and tell.” </p><p>“I … see,” she uttered, trying to process it, but I was more interested in the way her hand started to move once more. She was still gentle, but this time, there was an edge of sharpness in her movements. Somehow, she was feeling jealous. </p><p>It was ridiculous, but amusing, so, I said nothing about that, letting her continue. I still made some small corrections about her technique, of course.</p><p>“So, how does it compare to others?” she said almost five minutes later with a surprising amount of scorn in her tone. Or maybe not, I suddenly thought. The parallelism in the situation was obvious. She was trying to improve herself just to defeat other women to get Lancelot’s attention, so hearing that she was competing against a lot of women in my past couldn’t be easy.  </p><p>“If I’m going to be honest…” I said, letting my tone linger a bit before continuing, “A bit dry. You’re following my directions, but it best works with a lubricant.” She looked at me questioningly. “You can just spit on it.” </p><p>“S-spit on it!” she stammered, her outrage clear —and understandable considering she was a sheltered princess. </p><p>“Yes, spit. Sweetie, marital relations include a lot of bodily fluids. You need to get used to it quick.” </p><p>The resulting blush was so spectacular that I was afraid that she was going to faint. She closed her eyes, taking a deep breath, but interestingly, her hand continued to move up and down on my shaft. Her expression cycled for a moment, then she brought her free hand to her mouth. </p><p>I couldn’t help but gasp in pleasure as her other hand wrapped around my shaft as well, delivering the much-needed lubricant. “Keep it in there, it’s better with both hands,” I reminded her, and she did so, delivering a double-fisted hand job, but once again avoiding my gaze. “Excellent,” I said, and once again continued to give her various tips and tricks. </p><p>“Is it supposed to take this long?” she asked. “According to what I have overheard from the maids, it was not supposed to take this long. I feel like I’m doing something wrong.” </p><p>It lasted long, not only because I was more experienced than the pathetic lays a maid could find, but also Emma was kind enough to take the edge off my suffering last night. “Well…” I said, but let it slide without continuing. </p><p>“I’m doing something wrong, aren’t I?” she said immediately, once again her deficient self-confidence showing itself as she immediately blamed herself. </p><p>“Not exactly,” I answered, which was effectively an evasive confirmation, something that earned her attention. “Well, some visual stimulation would help things to go faster,” I reminded her. </p><p>“Like what?” she asked, this time somehow without any obvious stammering. </p><p>“I still remember the cleavage I had woken up to,” I told her, wiggling my eyebrows playfully. </p><p>“Shut up,” she murmured, but considering her hands were still moving along my length, I didn’t take that statement seriously. “This dress doesn’t have an open front,” she added. </p><p>“Are you wearing a corset underneath?” I asked. </p><p>“Yes,” she answered, her tone once again hesitant. </p><p>“Well, a corset is a pretty conservative piece of underwear, Even if you let the top of your dress to fall, I won’t be able to see a lot.” </p><p>That managed to shock her enough to pull her hands away, wrapping them around her chest. “That’s too much!” she exclaimed. </p><p>“Is it?” I countered. “Sweetie, it’s not really much considering what we’re doing,” I said. “And I already seen your cleavage in that dress, I doubt that your corset reveals any more.” </p><p>“No, but that’s different…” she murmured, but she made the mistake of meeting my gaze, her already shaky determination melting immediately. I said nothing, just let my gaze slowly trail down to my shaft, which was still glistening with her indirectly-delivered spit. “Or not…” she added with a sigh, and reached for her zipper. </p><p>I watched with rapt attention as she pulled her dress down to her waist, revealing a blue and white corset underneath that complemented her body perfectly. More importantly, it ended just above her nipples, enough to give me a glimpse of her areolas. The sight of her amazing breasts, trying to pop out of the constraints of her corset was even more amazing. “You look beautiful,” I said, the awe in my tone was not faked. She was truly one of the most beautiful women I had ever seen, and her innocence made her even tastier. </p><p>“I hope that’s enough,” she said, trying to sound exasperated, but unable to hide her own excitement. It seemed that caressing my most intimate body parts gave her a bit more courage about the way she dressed. </p><p>“Definitely,” I answered, enjoying the way she tried to turn her torso a bit like she wanted to avoid my gaze, only to give me a better view. She said nothing else as she turned her attention back to my shaft, both hands dancing along my length. “Don’t forget to lubricate,” I reminded her. This time, she didn’t waste any time before she raised her hand and spit on her hand. </p><p>Her cleavage was amazing, but I couldn’t help but want to see even more of her beautiful breasts. Luckily, with the cracks in the chains widened further, casting simple spells was trivial. Spells like a simple telekinetic touch to loosen the lacing on her back. </p><p>Unhappy with their imprisonment, her breasts were more than happy to make an attempt to freedom the moment I loosened the lacing, giving me a better view of her areolas, along with a hint of her nipples. The view it created was simply spectacular, pushing me closer to climax. Pity I couldn’t loosen them completely without making her suspicious. She was gullible, but even she must have her limits. </p><p>I turned to examine her face, wondering whether she noticed the trick, but I realized I wasn’t the only one feeling arousal. Her face was contorted with an innocent eroticism as she struggled under a sensation of arousal that she had never felt before.</p><p>“Lean forward,” I ordered, curious of her limits in her distracted state. Surprisingly, she followed that order without the slightest hesitation, not even bothering to look at her own chest. The angle was perfect, giving me a complete view of her amazing tits, her corset essentially turning useless under the circumstances. I couldn’t help but push my luck even more. “Lean more,” I said, and she did so, her lips just inches away from mine, temptingly innocent. “Now, give me a kiss.” </p><p>“What-” she started, shocked, but not shocked enough to lean back or stop playing with my shaft. </p><p>“I said, give me a kiss. As your teacher, I need to test how much you remember from your lessons,” I explained in a matter-of-fact tone, a tone that indicated that my words were not only rational, but also completely normal, no different than a teacher asking for his pupil to solve a simple problem. </p><p>A miracle happened, and she completed the motion, and I felt her lips over mine, panicky and hesitant, moving with a shaky slowness. Still, they delivered a delicious kiss. I really loved seducing innocent girls. The initial challenge was high, but thanks to their lack of experience, once their initial hesitation was broken, they didn’t know how to put new barriers, easily swept up at the moment. </p><p>The kiss turned even more beautiful when I probed her lips with my tongue, and they widened reflexively. I didn’t push my tongue in her mouth aggressively not to scare her, but gently coaxed out hers instead, until our tongues started dancing like gentle lovers. All the while, her hands continued to pump up and down, pushing me steadily toward a climax. </p><p>The kiss lingered for a long while, until my own body decided to interrupt, suddenly exploding, covering her corset with my seed. Even then, she was so distracted by the dance of our tongues, she failed to notice until the third burst, when it managed to hit her amazing cleavage. As she pulled out of the kiss, I used my magic to tighten the lacing of her corset, not wanting to alarm her even more. </p><p>“Excellent work, you’re really an amazing student,” I stated just as she pulled back, watching her first male orgasm with a great shock, failing to prevent her corset from getting drenched in my cum. </p><p>“Thanks,” she stammered, her blush getting so thick that I was worried about the possibility of her fainting. “Should we start healing,” she murmured even as she reached for her dress. </p><p>“Sure, but you should keep the dress down until it dries,” I reminded her. “You don’t want it to be stained.” </p><p>“You’re right,” she whispered as she put her hands on my torso, immediately infusing my body with healing energy, using it as an excuse not to talk about what happened. Not that I was unhappy about it, not when it gave me an excuse to enjoy her beauty. </p><p>The only question was, whether I should push for more, or should I let it be for today?</p>",

    "content": "<p>I couldn’t help but feel alarmed as I looked at the dragon. Yes, it acted as a nominal ally, and showed a surprising capability toward communication, enough to convince me about its intelligence,  but that didn’t remove the risk of a sudden betrayal. It didn’t give a sign of doing so, but considering I was betting on reading the body language of a creature I first saw today, my stress was rather understandable. </p><p>However, when I stopped for a second to examine it, those concerns flew away. Even just a glance was enough to show that the dragon was near death. Most of its emerald scales had lost their luster, giving a rotten feeling instead, which was probably the effect of its extended exposure to death energy. Its claws were trembling badly enough to remove their threat. Its every breath was labored, showing its exhaustion. </p><p>Examining it carefully, my earlier fear was replaced with a new one. Just how much distraction the dragon could be in its current state. I sighed as I came to a decision, one that required me to bet on the goodwill of a mysterious creature with a sketchy reputation. In the end, I decided to trust my instincts. </p><p>“Hold still for a moment, I’m going to heal you,” I said even as I put my hand on its body. It trembled under my touch, but made no move of pulling back. I gathered most of my mana together to cast a strong healing spell.  </p><p>[-2329 Mana]</p><p>The dragon let out another breath, this time somehow smoother. Some of its scales regained their shine, and its trembling stopped. It was still far from the optimal condition, but that was the best I could do under the lack of time. </p><p>Pity I couldn’t cast another spell even if my mana recovered. The only reason I was able to cast such a strong healing spell was the ritual that went out of control, and its effects were enough to prevent detection. However, I had to cast a protection spell to fend off the death energy when the ritual pulsed dangerously. Using the opportunity, I cast a healing spell on myself, even though it drained my mana further. With three instances of regeneration active, all I needed was to resist for twenty minutes for my mana to refill completely, making it a reasonable risk. </p><p>[-416 Mana]</p><p>[+623 HP]</p><p>“Let’s move,” I said to the dragon as I cut directly toward the nearest exit, and the dragon followed me immediately, smart enough to realize I was its only hope. I took a route opposite of the headquarters, wanting the necromancers to abandon that section as much as possible. </p><p>The first minute, we managed to avoid coming across anyone. I used a biomancy trick to hide our presence from their detection skill, which was a bit risky, but I was hoping that it would be attributed to the dragon. I was lucky that the dragon was relatively small, at least enough to silently move through the tunnels with its wings folded. It was still rather large, taller than a human even when it was all fours, but the tunnels were large enough to allow it to move. </p><p>Then, our luck turned, as I heard the shouts of necromancers, mixed with the unmistakable sounds of a bone dragon’s stomping. They weren’t too far away. “You try to get their attention, and I’ll hit them from behind,” I said as I pulled my sword and doubled back, looking for a connecting tunnel. </p><p>Dashing full speed, it took me less than half a minute to hit the ambush from behind, Aviada’s sword gleaming under the flashing lights of the spell battle. However, much to the misfortune of the four necromancers that was leading the skeleton brigade —and two bone dragons— a raging dragon was a distracting sight. Distracting enough to miss a warrior charging with a gleaming two-handed sword until it was too late. </p><p>I was so glad that I stopped by Aviada to pick up her sword, because with its assistance, one cleaving attack was enough to kill all four necromancers, though I slashed a couple of extra times to make sure before casting a flame spell and burning their remains. I didn’t want to leave blade wounds in their corpses.  </p><p>[-23 Mana]</p><p>Meanwhile, the dragon was under the assault of two bone dragons, barely able to resist their assault, while the skeletons leveraged the opportunity, trying to stab its legs. I jumped up, climbing on the back of one of the bone dragons, breaking its spine as I climbed upward. It raged, trying to throw me from its back, but my twenty-five points of agility were not for show, so I easily climbed up to its head, destroying it with one mighty smash that would make a barbarian king proud. </p><p>Without the support of its mindless brethren, the other bone dragon failed to resist the raging assault of the emerald dragon. Meanwhile, I cleaved through the rest of the skeletons, which took me less than ten seconds. “Do you mind burning the remains?” I asked kindly. </p><p>The dragon sent me a gaze, and I had to suppress a laugh. I was amused because its suspicion was almost a physical thing, and receiving such a look from a monster was amusing. Still, it followed my small request, burning the remains with its breath before we started running once more. </p><p>We have dealt with three more blockades until we arrived at the entrance of the tunnel which led outside, every encounter making me more glad that I actually brought the sword with me, allowing me to save my mana. I even transferred some more mana to my unlikely ally, who was more than happy to receive the extra boost. As a result, when we managed to break through another hasty barricade and came near a tunnel that led outside, I was rather confident that it would be able to escape with its life. </p><p>“The exit is here. The rest is up to you,” I explained to the dragon, not even bothering the possibility that it wouldn’t understand me. Its actions until now had proved its communication capabilities. </p><p>I wasn’t surprised when it raised its claw, and wrote in the air with flaming letters. ‘I owe you one.’ After fighting together several times, it was clear to me that the dragon was much smarter than a regular human, but reluctant to show it for some reason. The fact that it knew how to write was not a surprise. </p><p>The only interesting part was the alphabet it had used, which belonged to one of the ancient languages, and even among the mages, only a minority used it. Unfortunately, I didn’t have time to go into the details of it with an actual army of undead trying to find us. The dragon turned and left after one last nod, and I waved after it, before turning back and moved toward my own target. </p><p>The presence of the dragon was godsend in my infiltration attempt, even though they were alarmed. Whenever I came across a large group, I let them pass first or circled around them, and whenever I found a small group, I killed them using the sword before burning their remains with a low-grade flame spell, weak enough to avoid their attention. </p><p>As the raging cries of the dragon mixed with shouts and explosions, my journey got easier and easier. I was curious about whether the dragon would be able to survive, though it didn’t slow down my steps. I had more important things to do than their survival. </p><p>When I arrived at their operational headquarters once more, there were only two necromancers there, neither of them a lich, both standing guard. Sneaking to them under the constant interference of explosions was almost trivial, especially when they were standing on the other end of the corridor, not even paying attention to the entrance. I could have killed them easily, but I let them live. I didn’t want to arouse suspicion by killing them.  </p><p>Without any guard, walking into the room was a trivial activity, since the wards weren’t designed to keep someone away. And once inside, all the anti-espionage wards actually worked for my benefit, preventing my spells from being noticed. I rapidly cast duplication spells to copy every document I was seeing, which detailed a number of plans. Some were clearly in cipher, but solving them was the later issue. However, for one of the documents, I stole the original while leaving back the copy. </p><p>It was the detailed breakdown of the ward scheme of Silver Spires. </p><p>I couldn’t help but frown as I saw that. The presence of it put a frown on my face, because the number of people that had complete access to the defense plans should be limited. It might be that the headmistress was the only one that had access to them, or not. Regardless, I decided to talk with Titania first and discuss the documents before deciding on what to do. </p><p>There was a determined expression on my face as I escaped the headquarters, though not because of the escape itself, which, despite my earlier expectations, turned out to be rather easy. To be fair, it was easy to sneak around when there was a raging dragon loose inside. I used my escape tunnel to climb up, sighing relaxedly only after I took a deep breath of fresh air. </p><p>Still, even as the landscape blurred under my feet, I couldn’t help but feel that this wasn’t going to be my last encounter with that dragon… </p><p>For the first half an hour, I just run without casting a spell, doing my best to avoid attention. I healed myself and purged the remaining necrotic energy in my body once my mana was full, then summoned another pseudo-elemental as a mount. It cost a lot of mana, but the speed it provided was much more important, especially since I was a couple of hundred miles away from the school. </p><p>The journey took a while, especially since I had to take a break midway. I couldn’t help but sigh relaxedly as I finally saw the walls of the school in the distance. I dispelled the pseudo-elemental I was using as a mount even as I examined rays of the morning sun coloring the impressive —but not impenetrable, especially with the help of the plans in my hand— walls of the school. </p><p>I slipped inside easily. Compared to sneaking around in a necromancer base, it was nothing. </p><p>It took me less than a minute to sneak through one of the weak spots on the walls, which once again proved the complacency of the Silver Spires. No doubt the Necromancers were feeling confident enough to gather around. However, I had more important issues than the general overconfidence that infected one of the most important bastions of humanity. I needed to talk with Titania. </p><p>I met with a nasty surprise when arrived at the dead-drop location we agreed on non-urgent communication. There was a note from Titania, mentioning that there was an emergency, and she would be away for a day, maybe more. I bit my lips in disappointment, trying not to let out a cry of frustration. It wasn’t just her absence, but the fact that she didn’t bother mentioning anything about the mission, or how long it might last in the worst case. </p><p>The only happiness that I doubted the necromancers would be able to put another ambush together after my little surprise. I was able to browse through their plans on the way, and while many details were still encrypted, I was able to decipher enough to understand that the dragon I had saved to create a distraction was a crux in their plans, to be used as a ram against the weakest part of the magical defenses —which was discovered through detailed blueprints— by leveraging its magic resistance. </p><p>Running full-speed or trying to hold onto pseudo-air-elemental wasn’t exactly the best environment to analyze a bunch of papers, after all. But even if I had the opportunity, it would doubtlessly take a lot of time. </p><p>Luckily, I had someone clever enough to help. </p><p>When I arrived at my room, Helga was still sleeping, so I put all the documents on the table, hung Aviada’s sword on the wall, and had a quick shower in the corner of the room. Water spells were sure handy, especially when I could use some earth magic to create a drain and other amenities. </p><p>After showering, I didn’t bother wrapping a towel around myself as I went and kissed Helga. “Good morning, sleepyhead,” I said. </p><p>“Good morning,” Helga answered with a huge smile, not bothering about the cover that slipped away, revealing her naked body underneath. After sharing an extended kiss, however, she pulled back and frowned. “You look tired. Were you out the whole night?”</p><p>“Yeah,” I said, and chuckled at the flash of jealousy that passed her face, which was understandable. Just because she agreed that she wasn’t going to be the only woman in my life didn’t mean that she wouldn’t feel any jealousy. Even if I had an actual good reason for it. </p><p>I was tempted to tease her a bit about her jealousy, but unfortunately, we had bigger problems, and not enough time. “I found the base of the necromancers last night,” I said with a grave tone. </p><p>She grabbed my hand, tight enough that her fingers turned bone-white. “Explain,” she said, so I gave her a five-minute summary of my adventure, not particularly bothering to disguise the risks I faced. It made her panic, but I needed her to have an accurate background before she started working on the documents, just to give her a better idea. “You’re a madman, or have a martyr complex,” she gasped as I explained how I freed a dragon as a distraction just so that I could raid their headquarter. </p><p>I shrugged. “Hey, I’m not exactly loving the risks as well, but it’s not like we can just escape,” I explained. </p><p>“Can’t we?” she asked. </p><p>“Not if we still want to leverage all the benefits of the Silver Spires,” I said. “And even if we’re willing to give up all the benefits, do you really want to see what else they would do after the school has fallen. The Empire is already nothing more than a loose collection of cities, and the Silver Spires is one of the few places that is connecting them together. The royal family is strong, but they are barely able to stall the destruction, not reverse. I really don’t want to see what would happen if we lost our most important training facility,” I explained, then added with a smirk, “Even if that facility was elitist and pointlessly traditionalist one.” </p><p>“You’re right,” she said with a sigh, but when my smirk got wider, I earned a slap on my shoulder. “But you don’t have to be an ass about it.” </p><p>“I know, but it’s fun,” I said, which earned a playful giggle that made me wish I wasn’t about to collapse from exhaustion. Even worse, I only had a couple of hours to rest. </p><p>“So, you want me to decipher them, any particular priority?” she asked. </p><p>“Anything that pertains their contingency plans, I doubt that they would act immediately with their biggest weapon lost.” </p><p>“Are you sure the dragon has managed to escape?” </p><p>“Not completely, but even if it failed to escape, the ritual is definitely ruined. Even if they managed to capture it, the best they could have is a huge delay, and more likely, they had to kill it and raise it as another bone-dragon. It might be a bit stronger with its skin still intact, but it will not be anything close to their initial design.” </p><p>“Makes sense,” she said and just as she was about to turn, I grabbed her for an extended kiss, one that I used to drain my whole mana. Since I was about to regenerate it while sleeping, why not use it more efficiently. It wasn’t enough to make her Level Up again, but almost four thousand mana pushed her quite a bit in the distance. Also, I used the opportunity to examine her soul space, making sure that there was nothing wrong other than some harmless instability. </p><p>Still, a level a day should be a limit for a while, I decided, at least I could be certain about the side effects. I had managed to Level Up several times in a day, but my condition was rather unique. </p><p>“Have a nice sleep,” Helga gasped as I closed my eyes, her arousal clear. Pity that I was really exhausted, and didn’t want to abuse biomancy tricks to force myself awake. </p><p>“Wake me up in two hours,” I told her and closed my eyes. I was falling asleep when I felt a gentle kiss on my cheek. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 23    Experience: 263100 / 276000 </p><p>Strength: 28    Charisma: 38</p><p>Precision: 21    Perception: 25</p><p>Agility: 25     Manipulation: 30</p><p>Speed: 23       Intelligence: 30</p><p>Endurance: 22      Wisdom: 32</p><p>HP: 2737 / 2737\tMana: 373 / 3565        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Expert Arcana [75/75]        </p><p>Advanced Subterfuge [50/50]         </p><p>Basic Speech [25/25]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p>",

    "content": "<p>For once, I was glad of the necromancer’s predilection toward using mindless undead as guards rather than living troops. It was the only reason I even risked going into the base once more. Undead were stupid. As long as I pulled a cloak to my head, and hid my life signature with a simple biomancy trick —simple in terms of mana costs, as it was complicated enough to strain my newly-expanded capabilities to the limit. Though the existence of the escape tunnel helped me to relax as well. As long as I stepped out of the base, I was confident of escaping. After all, it wouldn’t be the first time I avoided the search of an undead horde. </p><p>Still, even with those advantages, my heart was beating like crazy as I walked deeper into the base, feeling the oppressive death energy getting thick enough to instantly kill a low-leveled person. Even with my resistance, I could feel my lifeforce getting damaged. Worse, I was afraid of using a healing spell, as such a pure flare might pull the exact attention I was trying to avoid. </p><p>[-13 HP]</p><p>Since I didn’t have a map, I decided to follow the unusually-thick death energy toward its source, which, despite the inherent risk, was better than walking around without a direction in the huge expanse of the base. There must be something interesting at the source, maybe evidence strong enough to convince the Headmistress about the seriousness of the subject. </p><p>The sooner I find something convincing, the sooner I could leave this oppressive place. </p><p>With that in mind, I walked forward, doing my best to stay in the shadows. It was a pity that I didn’t have a skill to enhance my sneaking abilities, but luckily, my extreme agility was enough to compensate for its lack, at least when they were not actively looking for me. Still, all the while, I continued to get damaged by the aura of the place. </p><p>[-39 HP]</p><p>I hid in the shadow of an open door, helped by the fact that the lighting conditions of the base were rather horrendous, to a point that I suspected it was an ecstatic choice, to make the place seem even more dramatic. Regardless, it helped me to avoid the attention of two necromancers that walked just a foot away from me, their attention on each other as they argued about the best way to reanimate a goblin. </p><p>I let them disappear around the corner before I started following the sound of their footsteps. They came from the same direction as the first necromancer, which meant that they were out patrolling, and likely was about to report. </p><p>My carefulness turned out to be a good idea, because soon, another set of footsteps joined them, and they came to a stop in a large room. I stayed away as I could see they weren’t the only occupants of the room, but even from the distance, I could see that the room was special. </p><p>First, the rest of the rooms and tunnels were barely more than natural caves. They had been clearly created in a hurry, with no care about the quality or details. That room was different. It was chiseled much more carefully, walls covered with dark gray marble, with several obsidian pillars to add some gravitas. </p><p>It was interesting to see that even in their half-dead state, necromancers were not free from the grasp of the vanity. </p><p>Unfortunately, vanity wasn’t the only reason for the obsidian pillars. Even from a distance, I could feel the thick magical presence of several wards dancing around the room. At first glance, I could see that none of the wards were related to combat, instead of focusing on secrecy. </p><p>I would have preferred offensive wards. The current anti-spy setup prevented me from using magic to hear them. To make it funnier, I doubted I was the target. Considering the lack of security in the rest of the compound, they clearly didn’t expect a hostile force to slip in, meaning the security measures were targeted to each other. I was a victim of circumstances. </p><p>If the room was less crowded, I might have tried to avoid the wards, as most of the spells were geared in for preventing remote spying attempts. However, while my acting abilities were fine, they were certainly not enough to bluff a group of necromancers in a dangerous secret mission that I was a surprise addition to their mission, sent by higher-ups, or something equally ridiculous. I doubted I would try that anything less than Grandmaster Speech, and even then, it would have probably been crazy dangerous, rather than plain impossible. </p><p>In the end, skills were not infallible. </p><p>With a sigh, I decided to continue toward the source of death energy that covered the corridors. Finding their operational headquarters was nice, but ultimately pointless without any physical evidence. If me being an eyewitness was enough to earn the trust of the Headmistress, I wouldn’t have taken the risk of infiltrating the base this deep. </p><p>I moved toward the source of the death energy, the closer I got, the more painful the passive assault of the death energy became. </p><p>[-61 HP]</p><p>Even then, I smiled viciously when I arrived at the source. My destination turned out to be another huge cave, not as big as the one that kept the undead army, but still rather huge. There were exactly a hundred obsidian pillars around the room, each radiating death energy, but they weren’t as interesting as the seven cages in the middle of the room, holding seven dragons —six corpses, and one alive. </p><p>I couldn’t help but feel my eyes widen as I saw an actual living dragon, its emerald scales gleaming under the flickering lights of the cave. The bone dragons I had faced during my battles were nothing, mostly because they were raised from the corpses of the dragons that had died ages ago, and their powers were limited. As a faction, necromancers were a threat because they had managed to discover several historic dragon graveyards, using these millennia-old corpses to create the backbone of their armies. </p><p>An actual live dragon was something completely different. </p><p>One reason for the difference was their strength. Unlike most of the creatures, it was hard to guess a dragon’s strength from the surface. They did not have the telltale signs of power, so battling against one was always a gamble. And just to make things worse, even the weakest one could probably contend against my current strength and could get away alive, if not victorious. </p><p>The strongest ones, according to the legends, were able to destroy whole armies and ruin cities. </p><p>Another reason was their mysteriousness. It was a relatively well-known fact that dragons provided no experience when killed —bone dragons did, but since they were necromantic constructs, it wasn’t surprising. Of course, that didn’t mean that a relatively weak dragon wasn’t a good target for hunting. They might not provide any experience, but their bodies were arguably the best magical material in existence, easily worth a fortune. </p><p>With their intelligence, however, it was really hard to catch them. That part, there was no real agreement. Some claimed that they were even more intelligent than humans but held back by their aggressive nature, the others claimed that they were just very intelligent animals, with a particular leaning for low-cunning, but regardless, it didn’t change the fact that the dragons were hard to find, and even harder to capture alive. </p><p>The fact that necromancers had managed to capture one alive was rather scary. </p><p>It was obvious the whole cave was designed to force its conversion to undead, but it didn’t look like a regular reanimation —which only created bone dragons, which, while dangerous, nothing really groundbreaking. Since they were going through that much effort, wasting enough mana to create a deadly miasma just as a side-effect, there was no doubt that they had other ideas.</p><p>[-163 HP] </p><p>The dragon was the only thing that was alive in the room, but not the only one that had a consciousness. There were eleven liches in the room, seven of them were wearing white robes and carrying bone staffs, their empty eye sockets glowing with an eerie blue. Each was sitting on top of a cage, and channeling the energies of the ritual they were conducting, the death energies invading the body of the dragon more and more. </p><p> The remaining four were wearing black robes, and carrying huge, ceremonial staffs from mahogany, watching the perimeter carefully. There was no doubt that they were strong, but I didn’t how much. I was willing to test, however.  </p><p>After all, I just found the distraction I needed.</p><p>I stood still for a moment, carefully examining the obsidian pillars, trying to understand their connection to the ritual. Deciding to take a risk, I gathered the smallest amount of mana I could push out while still maintaining connection, and slipped it toward the nearest pillar. </p><p>[-2 Mana]</p><p>I was caught the moment my mana touched the pillar, but not by a target I expected. The dragon’s eye met with mine in a subtle movement, and suddenly, I was sure of something. Dragons were definitely intelligent creatures. At least, this one was, because I could see its expression shifting slightly, one that conveyed its request for help despite its monstrous face. And it did so without alerting the liches. </p><p>That level of subtle communication was not something an animal could achieve. </p><p>I nodded, then gestured it to wait. It was partially a test to see whether my understanding was just an illusion, but when it nodded subtly, I decided to accept my plan was correct. I made a few gestures, and it responded with subtle shaking of its head or the movement of its eyes, until we had a very rudimentary sign language, enough to convey the basic ideas. </p><p>Then, I turned my attention to the obsidian pillar, and slowly pushed more and more of my mana inside it, once again, tantric skill providing its worth. Drawing my own runes on the pillars was the better method of breaking a ritual, but I didn’t trust myself to that while four liches with mahogany staff watched the perimeter. It was a small miracle I wasn’t already noticed. </p><p>[-70 Mana]</p><p>Of course, while my direct invasion was much harder and wasteful, it also had a certain advantage. It left no direct evidence of my intervention. Of course, a determined examination might reveal that the source of mana was different than the others, but it was much less noticeable than the presence of a glowing rune. </p><p>I stood still for twenty minutes, slowly spreading my magic while trying to ignore the effects of the death magic on my body, but in the end, I managed to infect fourteen obsidian pillars through my connection with the first one, while sweating horribly. My body was hurting all over from the stress of controlling all those different sources of magic, and the erosion effect of the death miasma that already drained more than half of my health was not helping.</p><p>[-4423 Mana]</p><p>[-1277 HP] </p><p>Still, I made sure to keep my mana pool near-full, because I was going to need that during the next part. I was confident in breaking the ritual, but the rest was total chaos. I didn’t know how strong the necromancers were, and I didn’t know how much energy the dragon had remaining. I hoped that it was enough to make it move. </p><p>I took one last breath, making sure my mana was distributed across the nearest pillars, still unnoticed by the necromancers. </p><p>Then, I gave the dragon the signal to act. </p><p>The dragon was a prisoner for a long time, cramped, exhausted, and tortured by the death energy that was constantly channeled by a cabal of liches. Even then, when when it raged, I understood the reason for the legends about them. It might be exhausted, but when it smashed against the bars of the cage, the shock traveled across the room, forcing the four liches to turn inward to help their fellows suppressing it. Even then, for a moment, despite all of its disadvantages, it looked like the dragon was about to get its freedom, the cage cracking under its assault. </p><p>That impression didn’t last for long, however. When the four black-robed necromancers raised their staffs and cast their spells, a complicated web of black energy fell over the dragon, wrapping its wings as it extracted a furious roar. Their staffs glowing brightly as they prepared to subdue the creature. The white-robed ones that were channeling the ritual were suitably distracted by the sudden rage of the dragon as well. </p><p>It was an excellent opportunity for me to act, one that I hadn’t squandered. I flared my mana, an effect that spread through twelve of the fourteen pillars I had managed to infect with my mana. </p><p>They exploded simultaneously. </p><p>The chaotic shouts of the liches put a smile on my face, especially when their gazes danced on the remaining eighty-eight pillars. Eighty-six of them were starting to flicker, so naturally, they grabbed their attention first, not the two that maintained their stability. </p><p>A big mistake from their end, because these two still contained the majority of the mana I used to infect the ritual. A ritual that was conveniently going out of control with some pillars already destroyed and others flickering out of control. A ritual that connected me to the dragon. </p><p>I used the connection to send the mana to the dragon. </p><p>It was the trick I first used on Titania then perfected on Helga, with great benefits. So, while using the trick, helping the dragon get stronger wasn’t my only objective. I also wanted to use the opportunity to probe its abilities, and maybe unravel a couple of mysteries about it. Maybe even get a peek into its soul space if I could manage.</p><p>However, the moment my mana touched its skin, I lost control of it, turning the second part of my plan impossible. Still, that was only a side benefit. The more important part was the sudden shine in the dragon’s eyes as my mana touched its skin before letting out another roar, this time even louder. </p><p>The roar wasn’t just sound, however. No matter how strong a roar was, it wouldn’t just unravel the defensive wards around it like they were made of summer clouds. The necromancers tried to cast their spells, but they were too distracted by the sudden reversal of the ritual. They were a second too late to prevent the dragon from bursting out of the cage. </p><p>The dragon’s first action in freedom was to open her mouth and spew out a flame so hot that it was bright white. Its flames spread around in a circle, hitting all six cages around it simultaneously, immolating the dragon corpses that were being used as a focus for the ritual. </p><p>Some of the liches that were sitting on top of the cages were quick enough to defend themselves, but not all of them. Two of them evaporated immediately under the raging flames. The rest managed to protect themselves from the flames, but not all of them did that flawlessly. Unfortunately, the one that was standing on top of the dragon’s cage, who was clearly the leader, had survived. I had a feeling that it was the strongest one, evidenced by its survival despite the dragon directly targeting him in its follow-up attack. </p><p>However, that retaliation cost the dragon quite a bit. The black-robed ones used the opportunity to retaliate, each letting out dangerous bolts of necrotic energy, all from close quarters. Despite the closeness, the dragon dodged two of them, showing surprising agility considering its size, but the other two connected with its bright green scales. </p><p>The attack pushed the dragon back as well, but luckily, it moved toward my side. So rather than trying to resist, actually moved with the blow, leaving the necromancers behind. </p><p>“Stop it,” called the leader, but he was unable to do so, because I had decided to leave one last gift, and used the two pillars under my control to further wreak havoc into the ritual, much easier considering I didn’t have to care about not killing the dragon accidentally. </p><p>The dragon managed to enter the tunnel as the ritual started to collapse, and all liches turned their attention to stabilize it, preventing it from exploding. As much as I wished to go and kill them, revealing my presence would be counter-productive if I couldn’t take all of them before reinforcements arrived. Even with the ritual collapsing, it was a long shot. </p><p>Then, I turned my attention to my unlikely ally. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 23    Experience: 263100 / 276000 </p><p>Strength: 28    Charisma: 38</p><p>Precision: 21    Perception: 25</p><p>Agility: 25     Manipulation: 30</p><p>Speed: 23       Intelligence: 30</p><p>Endurance: 22      Wisdom: 32</p><p>HP: 1126 / 2737\tMana: 3152 / 3565        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Expert Arcana [75/75]        </p><p>Advanced Subterfuge [50/50]         </p><p>Basic Speech [25/25]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p>",

    "content": "<p>Several hours —and one extended shower that turned into another tumble— later, we were sitting on the balcony, sipping champagne in silence, the rings shining under the reddish light of the evening sun. </p><p>For a man that was about to be hunted by three dangerous crime families simultaneously, I was feeling rather relaxed. Doubtlessly, a part of it was the security provided by the resort. Even for a dangerous organization like Blue Guard, breaking the neutrality of the place was not a reasonable action. Maybe especially for them, as bigger the organization, the more precious their reputation. </p><p>It left my mission as the only real source of danger. Of course, being on the crosshairs of the Blue Guard and Dominion Cartel would make it harder for me to act unnoticed. On the plus side, it would be easier to get access to private areas and meeting people. In general, I could even say that my mission got easier, though the extraction itself would get harder. </p><p>However, I didn’t pay much attention to those developments. I was more interested in the view. Not the view of the sea, even though it looked gorgeous as the blue waters of the sea bathed under the orange light of the sunset, the white sands of the beach shining with fire. </p><p>No, my eyes were locked on the beautiful figure of Sabrina, wearing only a loose bathrobe, leaving a delicious naked strip that left her breasts and midriff bare, though her crossed legs hid her beautiful core behind their delicious caramel color. I took another sip from the champagne as I enjoyed the beautiful curve of her breasts, climbing to her nipple, which was tempting my lips even after several exhausting hours we had just spent. Despite being a virgin until hours ago, she was truly insatiable. </p><p>Finally, it was Sabrina that broke the silence. “Well, that went a bit further than I had planned,” Sabrina murmured, but I could hear the fulfilled exhaustion in her tone, something that made me rather proud. </p><p>“I can’t say that I complain,” I answered, not bothering to hide my smirk, and received a playful slap in response. </p><p>“Shut up, you bastard. It’s all your fault,” she said, but her chuckle indicated her good humor. “I’m hurting everywhere…” </p><p>“Hey, what I can say, I was motivated. I remember several death threats I received, forcing me to continue,” I added, receiving yet another playful slap in response. I decided to caress her thigh in response, making her shiver. I was tempted to pull her on my lap, but the last session had left her rather exhausted. I doubted that she would be able to walk properly tomorrow. </p><p>After another five minutes of silence, she spoke once more, this time much more serious. “I’m sorry,” she said, her beautiful brown eyes centering mine. “I didn’t tell you but my family is not entirely … legal… I’m afraid that I might have pulled you in a situation too dangerous.” </p><p>“That’s a bit of surprise,” I said calmly. “I’m guessing that, these two assholes that were trying to get your attention aren’t entirely on the legal side as well,” I said, not looking particularly torn up. </p><p>“How did you know?” she said, her eyebrows raised. </p><p>I shrugged. “Well, in the lobby, Brad had found me and spouted some stuff about how Dominion Cartel was going make me pay for playing him for a fool and such things. From there, it didn’t take much to guess that the others on the table had some illegal roots as well.” </p><p>“Why all of my brother’s friends are idiots?” Sabrina murmured, clearly no more impressed with the intimidation attempt. Then she continued, once again serious. “Why are you not panicking, or angry at me? I have put you in danger.” </p><p>“I’m not angry at you because I had already managed to get their attention by recklessly joining that poker game,” I explained, which was completely true. Yes, her identity as the heiress of the Blue Guard complicated things further, but at that point, it was better to have multiple enemies. At least, by that way, when I finally disappeared, each party would assume the other was responsible for it. “And it’s not like they could touch me while I’m still in here,” I smirked. “And thanks to your clever assistance, I have enough money to live here for a long while.” </p><p>“You’re an interesting man,” she said even as she leaned forward, stealing a fleeting kiss. “Too bad that I can’t keep you.” </p><p>I shrugged even as I pulled her to my lap, but choosing to wrap my arms around her torso. “It’s better to cherish beautiful moments rather than lamenting about the future,” I answered. </p><p>She twisted her neck until our gazes met. “You’re really interesting… Too interesting, even. What’s your secret?” she asked. </p><p>I bobbed her nose playfully. “A man needs to have a little mystery around himself to ensure attractiveness,” I said with a smirk, catching her lips in another kiss. “So, are you ready to share that photo?” </p><p>“Of course not!” she answered. “We still need to dress, maybe even call the makeup team?” </p><p>“Do we?” I answered. “Wouldn’t it be even more believable if we share the photo from here, you sitting on my lap, wearing just our bathrobes? Doesn’t it make selling our lightning engagement much easier…” </p><p>“It does,” she agreed, but biting her lips worriedly. “But that makes it even more dangerous. My brothers are very protective and still believe that I’m a little girl,” she answered, the disdain in her tone revealing that their protectiveness was more about the male pride and less about love toward their sister. </p><p>“I doubt that at this point, it’ll make a major difference in my situation. You can choose whichever that fits your objectives the best,” I said, being more generous than necessary, but at this point, it was better to double-down. At least in this way, if I survived, I would have an amazing asset in the form of a high-level member of Blue Guard, making my future career markedly easier. </p><p>“You’re a very brave man, Michael,” she murmured. “A reckless, maybe even a stupid one, but brave nonetheless.” She said nothing else as she fixed her bathrobe, enough to make sure the photo was not obscenely revealing, but not enough to erase all hints of what we had been doing for the last several hours. </p><p>I pressed my lips on her neck and sucked hard enough to leave a mark, earning a warning glare. “Just to make it more convincing,” I said. </p><p>“Good point,” she answered before clamping on my lips, kissing hard enough to leave them bloated and bruised, not to mention stained with her lipstick. “Smile,” she said as she raised the camera, and inevitably, I did so. A genuine one, even, as she shared. “You should probably leave. Believe me, you don’t want to be a part of the chaos that’s about to erupt.” </p><p>“Whatever you wish, sweetie,” I said as I kissed her once more, but this time, I didn’t pull back easily, my hands sliding inside her bathrobe to trail the familiar shape of her breasts, enjoying the way she trembled as I teased her nipples. Unfortunately, I needed to return to my task, so I reluctantly stopped and stood up. </p><p>While I dressed, she quickly added some text to our photo, and sent the message that would launch inevitable chaos. “Done,” she said. “And as much as I would like for you to hang around, you better get away before I start talking with them,” she said. </p><p>“Call me whenever you want to meet up,” I said, and left the room after stealing one last kiss. Her phone was already ringing as I left the room… </p><p>*****     *****     *****     *****     *****     *****</p><p>I was in my room, just finished putting on a tux, about to leave my room for dinner, when I heard a knock on the door. I moved to open it, but on the way, grabbed a knife and started to peel an apple, just in case I had a hostile visitor. It wasn’t likely. However, likely and impossible were two different things. </p><p>When I opened the door, however, I met with a well-dressed older gentleman, with a mahogany tray in hand, his impeccable demeanor wouldn’t be amiss in a palace. He was probably one of the classical butlers, the kind that got paid in the millions but with the near-mystical ability to guess the mind of their masters. “How can I help you?” I asked, curious about his presence. </p><p>“I hope you’re having a nice evening, sir,” he spoke with an excellent British accent. “I’m here on behalf of our establishment, to present you with a little gift of appreciation for your continued patronage.” </p><p>“I appreciate the thoughtfulness of the management staff. Please communicate my best wishes,” I answered, not bothering to hide my excitement. It was a VIP card, their shiny black surface was hard to miss. I could feel my heartbeat going crazy. I acquired the key to my mission, and somehow, I did it much quicker than even my best estimation. Of course, I might have gained the dangerous attention of three international illegal organizations in the process, but that was just details… </p><p>“Of course, sir. However, if you’re available, I would like to communicate an invitation for a small dinner to share your joy,” he added. </p><p>I didn’t answer as I reached toward the card, trying to think of a viable way of rejecting the invitation. Now that I finally had the bronze VIP access, I would have preferred to scope the area and try to identify possible candidates rather than suffering through an event that would no doubt be pretentious and useless. </p><p>Then, I flipped the card, only to unable find the bronze strip I had been looking for, replaced by a silver one. I turned toward the butler with a quirked eyebrow, only to receive a soft smile, still impeccably kind and subservient. I took a breath, trying to gather my thoughts. Even for bronze, my only hope of qualification was to gamble rabidly for the next several days until I got the attention of the management. </p><p>Even considering my surprise ‘engagement’ with the heiress of the Blue Guard, it didn’t make sense. </p><p>“So, you mentioned a dinner,” I said, which was probably where the answer for my little question lay. </p><p>“Yes, sir, if you’re available, you have an invitation for the ninety-ninth floor.” </p><p>That was another surprise. Ninety-ninth floor, the restaurant at the top floor of the resort, one that was impossible to enter without an invitation even for the gold VIPs, dedicated only for the management board of the Resort. A management board didn’t sound scary, until one factored in that those nine mysterious figures effectively ruled the island that was at the center of the World’s illegal trades, from weapons and drugs to espionage. “Of course, when should I arrive?” I asked. </p><p>“Whenever is convenient for you sir, including right now. Mr. Hastings is going to be at the restaurant for the next several hours.”</p><p>Once again, I hated the mission. I had no idea who Mr. Hastings was, because I was here with almost no intelligence, trying to improvise a plan amongst some of the most dangerous people in the world. “Right now is fine,” I answered. The sooner I learned about this Mr. Hastings, who was probably the reason for my silver VIP status, the better. </p><p>“How about your room, sir,” the butler asked. I sent him a questioning look. “We have a nice complimentary room on the floor sixty-three, I could ask the waitstaff to carry your items there if you wish so.” </p><p>“I would appreciate that,” I answered fearlessly, mostly because I didn’t have anything incriminating in my room. One good thing about going to a mission unprepared, there was nothing to hide. Also, considering the number of people I managed to anger, I appreciate the increased protection as a result of increased status. </p><p>After making the arrangements for my new room, I walked toward the gold VIP elevator, and even that only went up to floor ninety. I let the scanner read my card as per the butler’s recommendations, and the elevator started climbing. The distance between gave me enough time to consider the possibilities, enough to make me worry. I was afraid that my real identity was discovered. </p><p>Even the invitation itself didn’t invalidate the possibility. I was sure that they would have loved the possibility of catching and executing one of the members of the Agency, the premier international organization for protecting the World. </p><p>The Agency might have turned into a shadow of its previous self during the last two decade —as evidenced by my horrible lack of support— but still, its reputation was miles ahead of secret services worked for governments, regardless if it was CIA, MI6, or even the past KGB. The Agency was the legendary pillar of the world, untouchable. </p><p>Or supposed to be untouchable, as Agent Brown’s disappearance had reduced the number of active agents even further. Even worse, I didn’t know how many of them active, or how many of the active ones were half-baked ones like I was, pushed to the field without their training completed. But the slow loss of power didn’t affect the reputation value of catching of the Agents for the criminal elements. The management of the Agency believed that it was the ending Agent Brown had received. Agent Brown, who was one of the few remaining legends of the Agency. </p><p>When the elevator door opened, I focused on the present, desperately hoping that the itching on the back of my head was not a premonition about the path a bullet would take minutes later. It was not the first time I faced the possibility of death, after all… </p><p>One of the greeters immediately walked toward me, and after a small bow, started walking away. I naturally followed, passing through the opulent restaurant, doing my best to ignore the eyes on me. The restaurant was furnished opulently, each table probably worth more than millions, but still, it was much less important than the people that were occupying the room. </p><p>Weapon dealers, drug lords, government officials including three prime ministers and two presidents from first world countries, even several global stars —some of them sitting on the laps of oil tycoons, giggling obediently. It was a room filled with wealth, status, and vice… I silently walked amongst them, ignoring their curious gazes. </p><p>The waiter left after one last bow, leaving me at the entrance of a private room, making me even more curious about the identity of my mystery benefactor. But when I stepped into the private room and found myself alone with an old man, my concerns rushed back to me. </p><p>Because I recognized that face. </p><p>The Butcher of Boston, one of the most famous hatchet men of the Irish Mafia in his youth, with a number of legendary feats, including single-handedly slaughtering a cell of Chinese Triad of fifty members trying to get established in Boston, killing them all in less than a week. But that was just the beginning of his legend. After his bosses tried to double-cross him, he had left New York and started trotting the globe, news about him getting more sparse, and also more outrageous, until the Butcher became a part of the legend. The last anyone had ever heard about him was one and half decades ago, where the photo of him was taken. </p><p>The itching on the back of my head got stronger…</p>",

    "content": "<p>“Continue running,” I ordered as we left the gates of the trading post behind. </p><p>“What was that?” Lillian asked, shocked. “Why are there so many people trying to catch us?” </p><p>“It’s not the time to talk,” I ordered. “Save your breath.” Then, I turned to Astrid. “We need to meet with your matron, but only after we make sure that we ditched our followers. You know the area the best, so you take the lead. I’m going to deal with our trail and our followers.” As I walked, I grabbed two stones, and hastily drew runes on them before passing them to the girls. “I’m going to stay behind, but I can follow their signature. It’ll also cloak you from other magical detection techniques for a few hours. If you face any danger, crush the stones, and I’ll rush to your side. Otherwise, try to find the meeting spot matron Helena proposed.” </p><p>“Isn’t it safer to move together?” asked Lillian. </p><p>“Not when we have a few hundred legionaries behind us,” I explained, not bothering to soften the blow. “I can deal with them if I faced them alone, but I can’t fight with them and protect you at the same time.” </p><p>She nodded in understanding, but rather than dashing away, she lunged toward me, and captured my lips in a heated kiss. One that was heated enough to tempt me for a lot more, especially since her clothes were drenched with rain, sticking to her body erotically. Pity that I didn’t even have a minute to waste. “Be safe,” she murmured before pulled away. Astrid, not wanting to be outdone, jumped to my lips the moment Lillian pulled back, but she said nothing before she turned and left. </p><p>It was funny just how much Lillian’s attitude had changed in a few days. When we started, she couldn’t even stand the sight of my face, only tolerating me because she had to, and now, the probability of separation enough to send her emotions into chaos. </p><p>Sometimes, being a hero paid off. </p><p>I watched the girls as they disappeared behind the thick curtain of the rain, for once, happy about the horrible weather conditions. The torrential rain made traveling grueling and inconvenient, but it affected our followers, even more, considering that they had to move as a group. The rain worked wonders to erase any tracks we might leave behind in minutes. Most importantly, it reduced the visual range to a point it had to be measured in feet, making it much easier to avoid detection. </p><p>Or in my case, laying traps. </p><p>I hated the situation I was facing. I was being chased by a group of soldiers of unknown size and composition, possibilities ranging from a hundred to several hundred, and I still had no idea why. It was not something political, that was certain. Mobilization of that many legionaries wouldn’t be necessary to deal with Lillian’s whole family, let alone catching a poor helpless heir. </p><p>I was sure that there was another reason, probably magical, but that left a scary number of possibilities. My initial guess was that Lillian was going to be a sacrifice for an illegal and dangerous ritual, but the more I understood about the power of my opponent, the more I started to doubt my initial conclusion. It needed to be something bigger. Even if it was a ritual, Lillian couldn’t be the only part of it. </p><p>Even worse, I had no idea where to get more information about it. The soldiers behind me was an obviously poor choice, and whoever was responsible for their presence, it was too much to expect them to be stupid enough to brief mere soldiers on important topics. I doubted that even the sorcerer-centurion that led the cohort — if there was indeed a full cohort in my tail, which was still a theory at this point — had that particular information. I knew that I certainly wouldn’t give them the full briefing when I could feed them a soup of nonsense about a kidnapped noble. </p><p>I had a feeling that the best source of information was the captain of the pirate ship where everything had started, but that came with another problem. I had no idea about his power, or his whereabouts, two factors that made ambushing him very difficult. </p><p>I sighed as I shifted my focus on my immediate task. My objective was to distract the army that was tracking me, and if possible, I wanted to do that without revealing my full range of abilities. Since they were already aware of my prodigious ability in runes, the choice was obvious. I stopped, and started drawing area-effect runes on the ground, using both my fingers and my magic at the same time to greatly reduce the time required to graft the runes. </p><p>Still, despite their intricacy, the runes were not strong, for two reasons. First, I wanted to hide my strength. Second, stronger runes were easier to detect by a competent mage. Not to mention that inconveniencing them as they followed me was a better idea than killing a few of them and angering the rest, along with marking myself as a traitor of the Republic. </p><p>So, I put several runes, from the ones that would make the mud even more slippery, to small flares of light enough to temporarily blind their scouts. They were little more than schoolyard pranks, but nonetheless, they were effective. </p><p>I picked a route perpendicular to one Astrid was taking —tracking it by the stones I passed to them— and filled the route with a number of the runes. After five minutes, an angry cry reached my ear, just a second after a noticeable flare of light, signaling that my followers had found my tracks. The neighing of the horse followed the cry, signaling that my followers were mounted. </p><p>“Fuck,” I murmured as I sped up my escape, spending less time with the rune traps. The speed of the mounted auxiliaries was inconvenient, but not as much as the fact that my attackers in the trading post were infantry, meaning the other soldiers found my track. </p><p>I was lucky that the forest was not too distant. </p><p>However, I wasn’t able to relax when I finally saw the trees ahead of me —only several feet considering the poor visibility from the rain. Because at that exact moment a small squad of riders appeared behind me, alerting me to their presence with a fireball attack, one that was raging threateningly despite the rain. </p><p>“Stop, you traitor,” called the leader as I dodged the spell. The fireball hit a tree, and the tree exploded violently. Excellent, I thought, happy for an excuse. I cared a shield in front of me simultaneously as I cast a telekinetic spell, funneling the shrapnel created by the explosion toward the horses, pained cries a song in my ears. Most of them were injured and about half of them had already fallen off their horses. </p><p>Only the three in the middle of the formation managed to avoid injury, their personal magical shields shining brightly. It looked like the result of a treasure rather than their personal magic, but two of them carried telltale signs of being a mage —staffs on their backs and material pouches on their belts. They were likely nobles, not a lot of peasants could afford personal magical items, and even if they did, they would prioritize weapons and shields. However, the explosion managed to catch them in surprise, making them unable to cast a shield.</p><p>“Damn, that was a bad spell. Why don’t you go back to the school,” I said cheerfully, stopping a second to mock my attacker. The mage that cast the fireball looked young, probably a recent graduate who joined the army to prove himself. Perfect target to anger, forcing him to make even more mistakes. </p><p>“You dare,” he shouted as he cast another fireball.</p><p>“Stop-” cried the other mage, who looked to be in his early thirties, easily recognizing my trap, but he reacted too late. The young mage had already finished casting the spell, one that I easily dodged and leveraged to explode another tree, accompanied by yet another rain of shrapnel to accompany the raging storm.</p><p>This time, the older mage was ready, and a transparent shield appeared between them, easily preventing any damage. But it gave me the precious seconds I needed to disappear between the trees. </p><p>“Catch him,” called the younger mage, only for his order to be countermanded by the older mage. </p><p>Pity, I thought, as I was curious how much it would take to break the legs of their horses. A forest was not the best environment for horse-riding even under the best of circumstances, and a horrible storm that reduced the visibility near zero was hardly the best. </p><p>I disappeared into the forest, listening to their angry cries. </p><p>The rest of the day passed in an entertaining blur. It was like a hide and seek game, only deadlier. I moved deeper and deeper into the forest, pettering my path with exploding runes, sticky or slippery spells, even magical caltrops. I didn’t neglect to anger the magical animals on my path as well, giving the legionaries following me something to kill.  </p><p>Toward the night, I started reducing the number of the runes I was leaving. I was yet to tire thanks to the expanded magical reserves of a sorcerer, but they didn’t need to know that. When the next morning was closing in, I was finally convinced that my tracks were impossible to follow, and changed my destination toward the stones my companions were carrying. </p><p>Reaching their location took me another two hours, but before I could find them, I heard angry shouts, easily recognizing Astrid’s voice. When I walked into the opening, I saw Astrid standing in front of Lillian, surrounded by eight men. Astrid looked angry, but from her demeanor, she clearly knew them as well. </p><p>It seemed to be an interesting situation…  </p>",

    "content": "<p>A sense of relief filled my heart the moment my chains clicked open. My sudden freedom tasted delicious, even though it was highly limited. I wanted to walk around, maybe even go for a midnight swim… </p><p>Pity that once more, I had more urgent things to do than sheer enjoyment. I was in the heart of the Empire, and whether I liked it or not, my fate was still linked to the political winds. Even the fact that the Queen wanted the Eternal Core wouldn’t change this fact, especially if there were other parties that were trying to undermine her. </p><p>Luckily, I already had my clue in the form of Emma’s mysterious mind arts teacher, some person that was either so incompetent that they were sent by the Queen’s rivals, or they were intentionally teaching Emma garbage in the hopes that she would accidentally turn me into a broken husk, therefore destroying the only clue about the location of the Eternal Core, probably killing Emma in the process as well. </p><p>They might be fancier, but when it came to shove Light Faction was no less merciless than us in politics. Maybe even more, since they didn’t have the option of outright murder. </p><p>I gave Emma a minute to get away from the door before I cast a spell that would cover my figure with shadows, effectively making me invisible as long as I was close to dark corners. Only after that I unlocked the door, and stepped into the corridor, just as Emma had disappeared in the spiral stairs, climbing down. </p><p>Having access to my magic once more was an amazing feeling, I decided as I followed Emma from a distance, not making a sound as I walked. My days as a freelance assassin taught me how to move unnoticed through a group of alert guards, following a single girl who was too distracted by her own arousal was a child’s play. </p><p>At the main door of the tower, I watched carefully as Emma cast a complicated spell, effectively creating a temporary key for the door, unaware that I was memorizing the spell itself. Just as she was about to complete the spell, I walked behind her, carefully staying in her blind spot, like I was a second shadow. When the door opened, she walked out, blissfully unaware of my presence. </p><p>Just like that, we were in a tight secret passage, illuminated by the flickering lights of a few sparse crystals, spread along evenly. I was lucky that the forbidden tower I was in was relying on obscurity rather than detailed defenses. The lack of guards made the task of escaping much easier. </p><p>I let Emma move forward a bit before following her, carefully memorizing the steps I took and turns I made. The secret passage had several different corridors, so I didn’t want to make a wrong turn on the way back. </p><p>However, things were more difficult once Emma cast another unlocking spell, and stepped into a normal-looking room. Panickedly, I followed her into the room, once again staying in her blind spot as she closed the entrance. I leveraged the flare of her own spell to attach a small tracking charm to her clothes, then hid behind her closet. </p><p>Hiding from just Emma was simple, but the same thing wasn’t applicable for a crowded corridor. Emma left the room immediately, leaving me alone. I glanced around, focusing on the paintings on the walls. One of them belonged to Emma, the other belonged to another redheaded woman, probably an ancestor, likely her mother or grandmother. </p><p>Interestingly, other than the pictures, there wasn’t much that caught my attention in the room. It was relatively small, and while it had quality furnishing, it was still not as impressive considering Emma’s situation. Just another evidence that she was being sidelined. </p><p>Still, I had more important things to do than focusing on Emma’s relative positioning in palace politics. For example, a better disguise than my horrible prison clothing. With a sigh, I opened Emma’s wardrobe, afraid of the selection I would find. </p><p>Therefore, I was pleasantly surprised when I found a box of male clothing on the bottom of the wardrobe, each piece carefully washed and folded. “I wonder if they belong to Lancelot,” I murmured in amusement. Stealing his clothes as a part of their dysfunctional courtship was just the thing Emma might do, instead of just talking and conveying her attraction. </p><p>We didn’t have the same size, but luckily, I was handy with household magic, so altering them took a couple of minutes. Then, I walked to her bathroom, using some of the cosmetics and generous amounts of magic to create some temporary hair dye. I used some of her makeup to enhance my disguise —most people relied exclusively on magic for disguises, which was always a risky proposition— and voila. I looked like a lazy minor noble in his sixties. </p><p>I disguised myself as an older man, because dismissed the older people more easily, and dementia was always a good excuse if I got caught in an area I wasn’t supposed to be in. Disguising as a servant would have been better if I knew the layout of the palace and recognized the key members of the staff. </p><p>After making sure my disguise was complete, I cracked the door, and only stepped out after making sure the corridor was empty. No need to create gossip of an older gentleman having an illicit relationship with one of the most prominent heroines of the Empire. </p><p>The palace corridors just as I expected. Tastefully designed but still opulent, generous application of marble sprinkled with the occasional touch of silver and gold. Other than white, the predominant colors were light blue and light green, creating a very relaxed feel that still reinforced the impression of Light. Understandable, considering the Empire positioned itself as the center of the Light Faction for several centuries. They wanted the image to support it. </p><p>As I walked down the corridors with the idle gait of a nobleman who had nothing to do but laze around all day, I didn’t get a lot of attention. I did receive some mocking glares because what I was wearing wasn’t the height of the latest fashion, but it wasn’t as attention-grabbing as a young nobleman out of fashion, another reason I chose to disguise myself as an old man. </p><p>I would have loved to have the opportunity to visit the library, or sit around and listen to the gossip of the servants, which would have provided me with the information I required. It was a pity that I had an important mission. I closed my eyes for a second, trying to focus on the tracer I had left on Emma, before I started following it. </p><p>“Nice,” I murmured when I found myself outside, in the palace gardens. It had been a while since I had enjoyed nature. The fresh smell of grass mixed with the sweetness of the flowers was a good chance after the stale air of my cell. Normally, I preferred natural greenery over the extremely-meticulous style of gardening in front of me, but it was still leagues better than the empty walls of my cell. </p><p>With that, I stepped into the hedge maze that my skill was pointing without any concern. I was relaxed, because the maze was poorly illuminated, which filled the place with shadows. A perfect environment for my shadow trick, and its constant twists and turns made it even easier. </p><p>Emma and her mystery associate weren’t the only people inside, I realized. The maze occasionally had wider openings with benches, though I could notice subtle carvings of runes that maintained the privacy of the occupants. So, when I finally found Emma and her so-called teacher, I wasn’t surprised when I couldn’t hear anything they were saying. </p><p>As I closed in, I examined Emma’s accomplice, while trying to suppress my desire to whistle in appreciation. It was a brunette woman with flawless alabaster skin, probably in her early thirties, but could be very easily mistaken for early-twenties instead with her beautiful face. She could be considered tall for a woman, had a slim, willowy body, and neither her hips nor her bust was particularly large. She wasn’t flat by any means, but her assets were not as generous as the other women I had the pleasure of spending time together recently. </p><p>However, that didn’t mean that she lacked sexual appeal. On the contrary, she had a deliciously-sharp aura that shouted femme fatale to my educated gaze, something that was reinforced by her shoulder-length curled hair, blood-red lipstick, and a black dress with an impressive slit that revealed her smooth leg to maximum effect, deep enough to reveal that she wasn’t wearing any underwear. </p><p>I had to admit, I was impressed. Not just her looks, but the aggressive persona she was displaying in the center of the Empire, which was famously conservative. I couldn’t help but wonder about who she was. </p><p>Breaking the privacy wards was a risk I wasn’t willing to take before I had the opportunity to examine them more in detail, so I stayed in the shadows. I tried to read their lips, only to realize that it was somehow still gibberish, proving my conservative decision correct. The ward was too complex to take down in a couple of minutes, especially when it was occupied. </p><p>So, I spent my time examining their expression. Emma was excited as she spoke, her hands dancing happily with each sentence, no doubt explaining her great success. </p><p>The brunette was listening to her with a smile that seemed to be satisfied, but I didn’t miss the frustration and anger that was flaring up whenever Emma looked away. Just as I guessed, she was not happy with Emma’s success. Their discussion lasted for almost twenty more minutes, and after Emma stopped, the brunette started explaining something calmly, occasionally touching Emma’s forehead. </p><p>She was teaching Emma mental arts, allowing me to confirm that she was not just an intermediary but the trainer that was sabotaging her —intentionally as well, considering her barely-hidden displeasure as she listened to Emma’s so-called success. </p><p>I had a new target to follow. </p><p>Emma left soon after they completed their training session, leaving the brunette alone in the alcove. The brunette left a minute later, but not before sending a magical signal. A well-dressed maid stepped into the alcove in just a few seconds. She was dressed no different than some of the other staff I had seen, except she had a coat of arms on her left shoulder, marking her as a private servant of House Fernhand.</p><p>The identity of the maid revealed the identity of the mysterious brunette, but I couldn’t help but feel surprised. House Fernhand was a well-known house of the Empire, but it wasn’t one of the inner echelons. They shouldn’t be strong enough to plot against the Queen. </p><p>“The mystery deepens,” I murmured in amusement as the maid left, and I followed her immediately. I wanted to see the destination of the letter, which was a safer option than trying to follow someone back into their protected estate. And since I had an idea about the identity of the brunette, I could find her another day. </p><p>However, following the maid was definitely not a boring activity. The first reason was the uniform of the maid. Initially, her uniform was tastefully conservative, but after she entered into the servant quarters, she sped up, and her skirt started to flutter, revealing her toned, muscular legs —though not in an ugly way. She reminded me of my special bodyguards, educated in combat but still maintaining her beauty. </p><p>And what a beauty she had. She had an exotic look with her pale skin, slanted eyes, and tight figure. Her bosom seemed modest, but looked delicious nonetheless. </p><p>When she stepped into a small storage room, I stayed outside, but watched from the keyhole, despite the risk of being caught. I didn’t want to miss her using another secret passage, but since she was more alert than Emma, I didn’t dare to walk behind her like I was her shadow. </p><p>She immediately cast an unlocking spell, confirming my guess about her destination. However, I couldn’t help but smirk when she pulled a small bag from the secret passage, and pulled a pair of pants and a shirt from it, both dark gray. I leaned further into the keyhole, not willing to miss the show. </p><p>She was methodical as she removed her clothes, giving me a glimpse of her body. Her body was just as tight as I guessed, though there was one rather interesting surprise. Chest bindings were wrapped around her torso tightly, suggesting that she might not be as flat as I first saw, making me curious about her true sizes. Another interesting fact was her scars, suggesting that her life wasn’t entirely peaceful. They were old and faded, and interestingly enough, they just added to her sex appeal. </p><p>I liked to tame dangerous ladies. </p><p>After changing, she took the secret tunnel, closing the entrance after she passed. I slipped into the storage room, and opened the entrance by copying her spell. However, rather than following her immediately, I grabbed the servant clothes she left behind, and carefully cast a few spells on them, allowing me to track them further. </p><p>Only then I started following her, easily since the tunnel had no intersection. After ten minutes of careful jogging, she stepped outside, to the inner city. </p><p>I smirked in shock. Just like that, I had discovered a way out of the palace, which was supposed to be a near-impossible task for me. Technically, I could escape the capital city of the Empire, which I assumed to be impossible. </p><p>However, just because I had the option didn’t mean that I should do so. At this point, I was skilled enough to get away, but I didn’t have a plan even if I succeeded in that. I needed more information, and discovering the mysterious ally of Queen Sapphire’s enemies was a good start. </p><p>I followed the maid for almost an hour. She was good. She doubled-back several times, left false tracks, and even changed her disguises. Too bad that I was better. Then, finally, she dropped the letter in a concealed box in an abandoned street. </p><p>She went away, but I stayed there, waiting for the next person to pick it up. That person came twenty minutes later, dressed in opulent clothes, looking like a wealthy merchant. The best strategy was to tail him back to his base of operations, then use several agents to map his all interactions, identifying several more contact people in the process. </p><p>Too bad that I lacked the time and the resources to actually do it. So, I followed him two streets before appearing behind him, and grabbed his throat. “Hello, my friend,” I said with a whisper. I was slightly surprised when he turned, his hand crackling with darkish purple energy. </p><p>I was startled, not because of the attack itself, but by the familiarity of it. Even before his attack connected, I grabbed his wrist and cast the counter-spell, and he collapsed in pain. “Hello, little one,” I said mockingly before whispered a keyword. “Isougrim.”  </p><p>“I’m sorry, Dark One,” the guy exclaimed as he collapsed on the ground, his face pressing against the ground despite its dirtiness, his hands open. He was shocked, because I had just used a keyword that signaled my position as a member of the Dark Council, one that had access to his master key. Of course, I had used a lower-level keyword. There were hundreds of members of the Dark Council, though having one in the middle of the Empire was still a rarity. </p><p>More importantly, I was able to use the correct keyword. I was able to do that easily, because I recognized the spell. It was invented by Vradan the Adept, who was one of the seven members of the executive committee of the dark council —the strongest after the Dark Lord. Vradan was also one of my betrayers.   </p><p>“I have a few questions for you, little one,” I said with a mocking smirk.</p><p>“Dark One, my orders disallow me from speaking anyone but my handler-” he started, only to fell silent when I put my foot above his head. </p><p>“Little one, be smart,” I said. “I’m here despite knowing which group you belong in the council. Do you really think that I’m going to stop just because I’m afraid of angering your handler? You’re going to speak either way, the only difference is whether you’ll be able to see the sun again.” </p><p>“I-I understand,” he stammered, with fear. </p><p>“Don’t be like that,” I said with a chuckle as I gestured him to stand up. “Suddenly finding yourself in the middle of a plot is not a good experience, but that doesn’t have to be bad. Play your cards right, and keep your handler from getting suspicious, and who knows, maybe you can get a Council Seat.” I sighed. “There’s going to be a lot of empty seats in near future, after all.” </p><p>The sudden change of expression on his face was understandable. After all, what I outlined was a good opportunity despite the risks. Being a double agent was risky, but also had great benefits for him if he could play it right. I had a feeling that I could count on his greet. “I understand, Dark One,” he said obediently. “What do you want to know.” </p><p>“Hmm… Let’s start with your handler,” I said with a smirk, enjoying the way he started to sweat. Understandable, as by starting on his handler, I was basically forcing him to betray his faction, and worse, he couldn’t even lie, because he didn’t know how much I knew. A bluffing attempt might be his end. </p><p>With a sigh that signaled his surrender, he first explained the structure of his cell without telling a single lie. Smart, I thought, before changing the topic and grilled him about a lot of topics, most of it targeting events that I already knew before my capture to make sure he wasn’t going to try to slip a lie, before I started grilling about his role in communication with House Fernhand. </p><p>Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to learn much from him, and none of the things I learned was good. It was clear that Vradan and his group were communicating with House Fernhand greatly, and it seemed that the potions and Emma’s faulty training was a way to assassinate me. I didn’t know whether it originated from House Fernhand or Vradan, but either way, it was rather bad news. </p><p>I had even more enemies than I had expected. Which meant, escaping was not an option, not if I was willing to live as a peasant or a bandit for the rest of my life. Even for me, trying to build a new power base was impossible while being hunted by several Dark and Light faction simultaneously. </p><p>“Good work,” I said, and let my new intelligence asset go, but not before learning everything about his house and his safehouses across the city. It was likely that he concealed some personal safe houses, but that was understandable. He wouldn’t use them unless he was willing to take the risk of being hunted by my mysterious faction —impossible to find, even, considering it didn’t exist— as well as surrendering a future where he could actually become a member of the Dark Council. </p><p>Still, despite some bad news, I was satisfied with the benefits I had earned today. However, as I walked back to the secret passage, I had one question in mind. Should I return to my cell, or should I push my luck a bit more?</p>",

    "content": "<p>The moment I detected a group of undead, a smile appeared on my face, cold enough chill a necromancer if one had been unlucky enough to observe it. Discounting the encounter with the shade, I had faced against necromancers twice, and both times, they had the initiative, forcing me to face dangerous odds. </p><p>This time, I had all the control, and I was more than willing to teach them just how big of a difference it would make. </p><p>One little drawback about my increased biomancy skills was the increased detection range. I had to travel a couple of miles before I saw the group that triggered my senses. It was a small group, one necromancer, and around a hundred assorted skeletons and other low-level raised creatures. Destroying them would barely take a minute, but one detail prevented me from doing so. </p><p>They were dragging several creature corpses toward them. It wasn’t the corpses itself that dissuaded me of course, but the fact that they were traveling toward a certain direction. I decided to follow them, hoping to discover their base of operation. After all, it was unlikely that I was the only one who was able to set up a hard-to-detect defensive bastion. </p><p>Following them was not a fun affair, not because of danger —as not only it was impossible for the undead to detect me, but also most creatures didn’t come too close to the undead, a combination of their negative energy and their smell enough to dissuade the lower-level creatures. This meant that I had a pretty boring trek following them. </p><p>Not one to waste time, I started practicing a new trick with Biomancy. Since Biomancy allowed me to use life energy in a variety of ways, maybe it could also allow me to fake the death energy the undead was spreading around. I closed my eyes for a moment, extending my sense to examine the effect in detail, trying to understand the death energy. </p><p>Just from a glance, it was obvious that death energy was a corrupted variant of life energy, one that wasn’t that hard to create. After examining it for five minutes, I realized that I could easily master its usage after a couple of repeats. It wasn’t even that difficult. </p><p>The problem was avoiding the effects. I could see the effects of corruption and degradation on the necromancers pretty easily, but that didn’t give me an idea about just how easily such effects had started. I wasn’t really willing to test it, however. For some reason, a part of my mind was repulsed by the idea. I decided to follow my instincts. </p><p>However, that still left me with the challenge of avoiding their detection. Maybe I could reverse the effect, I suddenly decided, enjoying the sudden insight generated by the magical theory —that new perk was definitely proving its worth. I used my biomancy skill not to radiate life energy, but slowly drain it from my surroundings. It was a soft effect, not harming even a bug since it lacked the death energy’s persistence, but from a distance, it looked like an undead’s death energy. </p><p>It would never trick a careful examiner, or even a casual glance from a proficient one, but it gave me enough confidence to try to slip into the skeleton horde after casting an illusion to hide as a zombie. I cast the required spells, and then moved forward. </p><p>My hand was tight around my sword, but I wasn’t feeling afraid. Why would I, when I could incinerate the whole horde with just a spell? The worst thing that would happen was losing the chance of infiltration. A pity, but definitely not something to be afraid of. </p><p>I moved another twenty minutes as a part of the skeleton horde, until it came to a sudden stop. The necromancers moved forward until it stopped in front of a stone, then activated a spell, making a detection wave spread, filled with death energy, enough to break through my poor concealment. </p><p>“Damn,” I murmured even as I noticed the necromancer dashing forward, with a necrotic bolt already in hand, shining purple and black. I needed a distraction. Then, my eyes fell on the nearest creature corpse, and I cast a healing spell on it. The creature was dead, so it wouldn’t resurrect, but it still repaired the body a bit, just enough that when I cast a weak lightning spell, it flinched wildly. </p><p>Necromancer’s mad dash slowed when he noticed the wildly flailing creature. “Fucking mindless undead,” he murmured, threw the death bolt to the creature to make it stop, and turned his back. When he arrived at the stone, luckily, he didn’t activate the detection ward once more. Instead, he cast a couple of spells, and the ground suddenly parted, showing a tunnel, much wider than I had created. </p><p>If it wasn’t for my elemental abilities, I would never dare to step into an underground facility filled with undead, but I decided to take the risk with it. No matter how crowded it was, and how strong the defensive abilities, defensive structures were not impenetrable, especially from inside. That didn’t mean it was completely risk-free of course, but the temptation of finally getting some intelligence on the activities of the necromancers was simply too tempting. </p><p>With that in mind, I stayed mixed with the horde as we stepped inside a dark tunnel layered with runes after runes, the magical energy getting thicker the further we moved. It was a work of years, maybe even decades. I couldn’t help but feel alarmed at such an impressive construction project going unnoticed that close to the school. </p><p>The alternative was even scarier, that it was noticed, but their allies inside were able to suppress it. It shouldn’t be possible, but considering that they were feeling confident enough to ambush one of the strongest faculty members —and gather the necessary intelligence to do so successfully— maybe they were entrenched enough to actually succeed with that.</p><p>Maybe some of the dissident voices were right about the fate of the Empire, and the need for action. If the Empire’s most important education organization, responsible for churning its key officials, generals, and mages was lax enough to be infiltrated by the necromancers, what hope was there for the rest. Luckily, it was a problem well-above my paygrade, so I abandoned that track of thought, instead carefully examining my surroundings. No matter how deep we moved, the tunnel hadn’t lost its downward slope, so when we finally stopped at a huge cave filled with a veritable army of undead, we were at least half a mile deep underground. </p><p>And it was an army. Countless zombies, skeletons, and other low-level monsters were abound, but it wasn’t as scary as some huge creatures that interrupted their monotony, goliaths, giants, and dragons. I felt a chill as I looked at the endless piles. One mistake, and I had no chance of escape. </p><p>The members of the group I was hiding split. The ones that were pulling the dead creatures continued deeper into the cave, while the others joined the army. The necromancer, after giving the orders, took a side corridor. </p><p>I stayed with the mass army for the moment, examining the cave. The scariest part of the army was not just the size itself, but the fact that I could see undead creatures moving back and forth through several tunnels, suggesting that this might not be the only cavern. </p><p>It was an army that I had no hope denting. Even worse, I didn’t even know the school could resist a full-powered assault from them. Ideally, it should be able to, as there was a reason the Silver Spires stood tall for centuries, despite every type of danger. However, their allies inside were a cause of concern. </p><p>What if they were high up in the chain to be able to sabotage the defenses? </p><p>I wish that I could solve the problem directly, but even with everything I had, I couldn’t make a dent in the army in front of me. But I had to be at least ten levels higher to make a meaningful impact before I heroically died. Winning against such a huge army was an impossible wish. </p><p>Luckily, however, a direct intervention was not the only option. Currently, I was in the middle of their base, and they were unaware of my presence. I might not destroy their huge army, and while killing the necromancers leading them was tempting, I couldn’t kill enough of them to make a difference. </p><p>That still left an excellent way of damaging their effort. Intelligence. </p><p>The more information I could bring to Titania, the better response she could organize. Even better if I could get some strong evidence to convince the Headmistress about the danger we were facing, allowing me to make a credible first contact. </p><p>Of course, none of them was as important as me getting away from here alive… </p><p>As I moved forward, I couldn’t help but feel glad to have Aviada’s sword with me. If things devolved worse, it might give me the edge I needed to stay alive until I cut myself an escape. I moved into the same tunnel the necromancer had gone, and found a long, deep corridor, conveniently empty. </p><p>And more importantly, conveniently bereft of magical protection. </p><p>I decided to create a pocket of action. I quickly draw a temporary rune in the air to hide my magical presence before I put my hand on the wall and carved a small room, only to immediately erase the wall behind me. Then I tunneled deeper, hoping that their construction was sufficiently shady. </p><p>[-420 Mana]</p><p>[+2 Elemental]</p><p>After moving almost three hundred meters deep into the earth, and drawing several more permanent magic-concealing runes and wards —expanding even more of my dwindling stack of reagents— I found out my guess was only half-correct. They did have defenses underneath the base, but it was sloppy enough that I was easily able to penetrate it without raising an alarm. </p><p>[-1637 Mana]</p><p>Okay, I had to admit, spending twenty minutes and wasting enough mana to destroy a squad of bone dragons didn’t exactly count as easy, but I was annoyed, and wanted to mock them a bit. After competing for that, I started moving to the north in a direct line, digging a tunnel of three miles —layering with anti-detection runes and other protective measures— to ensure I avoided tangling with anything important. Only then I created a tunnel upward, careful to avoid entanglement with their wider tunnels. When I finally created an exit to the fresh air, I couldn’t help but smirk in satisfaction. They might have worked for years to create an impenetrable base, but it took me only a night to break it. </p><p>[-2320 Mana]</p><p>[+6 Elemental]</p><p>Now that I had an escape route, I felt more confident. I reinforced the exit point with another trap before taking the tunnel down once again, returning to the base. </p><p>About fifty feet before the base entrance, I created a larger room, piling it with traps filled with life energy, ready to explode the moment an undead stepped through the gate. I stayed there for almost half an hour, filling the room with traps twice, enough to eviscerate anyone who dared to step through. If I got caught, I needed to scare them, and an apocalyptic explosion of life energy would doubtlessly do the trick.  </p><p>[-6750 Mana]</p><p>I moved only after my mana was full once again —though I was a bit sad that the first instance of my mana regeneration, the one I received from Helga, had expired— just to make sure I was prepared in case something went wrong. I once again started pulling life energy to fake their necrotic energy, and soon, I arrived at the entrance and took a deep breath, steeling my nerves. </p><p>Even with all the preparation I had made, a mistake, and I was a lifeless undead… Still, I continued forward… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 23    Experience: 263100 / 276000 </p><p>Strength: 28    Charisma: 38</p><p>Precision: 21    Perception: 25</p><p>Agility: 25     Manipulation: 30</p><p>Speed: 23       Intelligence: 30</p><p>Endurance: 22      Wisdom: 32</p><p>HP: 2737 / 2737\tMana: 3265 / 3565        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Expert Arcana [75/75]        </p><p>Advanced Subterfuge [50/50]         </p><p>Basic Speech [25/25]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p>",

    "content": "<p>It was barely after midnight when I left Marianne’s room, and was exploding with energy. Helga was exhausted, and Aviada was not much better after our morning adventure. Titania was unfortunately inaccessible, and the less it was said about Marianne and Cornelia, the better. </p><p>I was hit by the surprising realization that I needed to expand my circle of … let’s call it ‘close friends’, the best I could do without being extremely crass. </p><p>However, that realization didn’t help me in the middle of the night. I could have gone to sleep, of course, but I didn’t want to waste the three instances of mana regeneration. Maybe I should go for another hunting trip, this time without Aviada, to properly test my new limits. </p><p>Even with that decision, however, I started walking toward the wing that housed the female warriors. I wanted to go out alone, and I trusted my magical abilities, especially with three instances of regeneration active, but a little extra insurance in the form of a masterpiece magical sword wouldn’t be amiss. </p><p>Sneaking through the empty corridors was trivial, but when I arrived at Aviada’s door, I hit a little snag. I could hear Aviada’s tone, speaking with someone. A small arcana spell allowed me to peek through the keyhole, and revealed that Aviada sitting on her bed across a redheaded figure whom I could only see her back. </p><p>My eyes were sharp enough to recognize her impressive curves. It was Aviada’s redheaded friend that I met in the showers —if I could classify that as a meeting. Regardless, considering the compromising conditions of our first encounter, barging in was not exactly a problem. </p><p>I managed to sneak inside without alerting them, amusing considering they were supposed to be sharp-eyed warriors. Feeling mischievous, I cast a silencing ward to make sure we didn’t alert the whole ward, then spoke. “Hi girls, having a nice evening?” I asked. </p><p>The redheaded friend, Carla if I was remembering correctly, jumped to her feet, her hands reaching to her back to get a weapon that was absent while her hand dipped to the side. Just from that move, I could see that she was an archer, trying to get her bow and arrow at the same time. It was an impressive move, too bad that she was only equipped by a long conservative nightie. </p><p>Correction, wearing a nightie that would have been conservative if it was being worn by someone less endowed, because both her hips and her breasts were stretching the thick fabric to the limit temptingly. </p><p>Before I could enjoy the sight to my heart’s content, Aviada spoke. “Honey,” she murmured with an exaggerated tone even as she pushed her chest out, her nightie struggling to contain her assets as well, just not at Carla’s level. But Aviada was a smart warrior, and discreetly popped a couple of buttons to equalize the situation. “What a nice surprise!”</p><p>Her out of character response was amusing. Not the enthusiasm itself, as Aviada could act with a burning need whenever she desired something, but actually using her words to express her emotions. When Carla turned to give her an incredulous look, and Aviada responded with a smugly satisfied one, I understood the reason. Aviada was using me to brag to her friend, who no doubt had been grilling Aviada about our morning encounter. </p><p>“So, he just comes and goes whenever he wants,” Carla said exasperatedly. “Who is he, exactly?” </p><p>Before Aviada could speak, I sneaked behind her, and whispered. “He could speak for himself,” I said, and she jumped in shock, unable to catch my movement. </p><p>“How?” she stammered, her eyes wide. “I’m a ranger! No one can sneak up to me, especially not when I’m aware of their presence.” </p><p>“If you say so,” I answered with a soft smile, fully aware it was a more devastating brag than actually bragging openly. Carla blushed, but her eyes flickered with anger, but she didn’t say anything before I sat down. </p><p>“So, what brings you here, sweetie,” Aviada said as she put her hand on my shoulder, caressing softly. Well, if she wanted to play, I was going to play. I grabbed her waist and pulled her on my lap, nibbling her neck. “Stop,” she giggled, another surprising reaction. “Don’t do in front of Carla, she gets jealous.” </p><p>I smirked at her words. Combined with Carla’s flush of frustration, it was easy to understand the reason for Aviada’s shift. They were clearly good friends, likely with a long-standing argument about boys and boyfriends. “Sorry,” I said to Carla, not bothering to hide my smirk as I wrapped my arms around Aviada, pulling her tight. </p><p>“Okay,” Carla stammered, trying to look unaffected but failing badly. “I should go, you’re clearly going to be busy.”</p><p>“Actually, you can stay. I’m just here to borrow something and then I’m going to leave,” I said. Aviada turned to look at me questioningly, and I nodded. It was only one thing that could borrow from her that would make a significant impact on my prowess. </p><p>“Sure,” she said as she stood up and reached for her sword, but when she returned, she gave me a flirty wink. I understood exactly what she was asking, when she carefully pulled the backside of her ass, giving me a glimpse of her naked bottom. Just as she was about to sit, I cast a spell to pull down my zipper and free my shaft, only to push it directly into her slit. </p><p>If she wanted a sneaky quickie in front of her friend in exchange, who was I to argue. </p><p>“I can’t believe you’re giving him your sword,” Carla said, shocked. </p><p>Aviada shrugged, which was a good excuse to hide her movement as she tried to fit the entirety of my shaft into her unprepared entrance. To her credit, she managed to struggle without an outward signal. “I trust him,” she simply said. </p><p>“I can’t believe you! You trust him! What do you even know about him? I have never seen him in any of our incursions or classes,” Carla said angrily. </p><p>“It’s expected,” Aviada answered. </p><p>“Why?” </p><p>“Because he’s a mage,” Aviada simply said. I couldn’t help but feel amused at her words more than Carla’s shocked reaction. A few days ago, Aviada would have never willingly admitted that I was a mage, thinking it as a shameful detail that needed to be hidden. Instead, she was using that as a humorous detail to mess with her friend to the point that she was underselling my warrior capabilities. </p><p>It was an amusing change. </p><p>“He’s a mage?” Carla countered as her gaze danced on my body, namely my thick arms and my broad shoulders that suggested a lot of explosive power. “Bullshit,” she countered. “Mages does not like this, and a mage could never sneak upon to me,” she said heatedly, in her anger, missing the fact that Aviada started moving up and down on my lap, struggling to keep her face straight. “And if he’s a mage, why does he need your sword?” </p><p>“Well, he dabbles with it a bit, and I see no problem letting him borrow my sword,” Aviada said, still hiding the fact that it was my ‘sword’ that she was currently borrowing. </p><p>“I don’t believe it,” Carla said resolutely, the stubborn expression on her face giving me insights about why these two were friends. </p><p>“Well, if you need proof,” I said. I raised my hand, and cast a small, glowing ball of fire, dancing freely before it turned into water, then pulled the dust particles around to turn into a small but tight piece of glistening rock, only to disappear into the air. It was a simple, but impressive display of elemental abilities. </p><p>“Impossible,” she murmured as she closed her eyes. “How did you sneak in, then?” she said. “A mage could never beat a ranger when it comes to concealment and observation.” </p><p>“Never? Are you sure?” I said. “Do you want to bet?” </p><p>“Yes, whatever you want!” she answered. </p><p>“If you’re sure,” I said even as I grabbed Aviada’s shoulders and pressed her down while I let myself explode into Aviada, making her moan loudly. It was a bit premature, but I wanted to make a point. Then, I raised Aviada’s skirt, and showing my presence lodged inside her, making Carla’s chin drop in shock, immediately followed by a blush that left her rooted in place.</p><p>[Mana regeneration perk activated. Count 4. Duration, 8 hours]</p><p>I was expecting Aviada to be a bit dissatisfied, but the sudden shift from sneaky sex to voyeurism had managed to trigger her as well, leaving her gasping and trembling. </p><p>“Thanks for the sword, sweetie,” I said as I kissed her lips, then pulled out of her and left her trembling on the bed, but with satisfaction on the bed. Normally, she would be asking for the second round, but she was still sated by our morning activities. I fixed my pants, grabbed the sword, and started walking toward the door, only to stop next to Carla. </p><p>“So, when do you want to handle the results of our bet?” I asked her, leaning forward just a bit like I was about to kiss her, but stopped before making contact. </p><p>“N-no, it doesn’t count,” she tried to stammer. </p><p>“Oh, honey, believe me, it does,” I answered even as I put my hand on her thigh, and slowly let it climb up, and she stayed frozen. But just as it was about to touch her wet lips, I pulled back. “I’ll send you a message I feel like taking the forfeit,” I said and started walking once again, aware that both pairs of eyes were fixed on me, a pair shining with pride, the other with shock. </p><p>Then, just as I was about to leave the room, I gave her one last look. “Or maybe, I’ll drop by one evening,” I said, enjoying her gasp just as I left the room. I dispelled the silencing ward, only for Aviada’s laughter to reach into my ears. </p><p>Amused by the unexpectedly productive visit, I left the school as quickly as possible. I wanted to be back before the sunrise, and more importantly, I want to use my four active mana regeneration perks to the limit, lowering my complete regeneration time to fifteen minutes. </p><p>Sneaking out of school was getting easier and easier as I got stronger. After getting away from the walls, I started running with a mad dash, using my enhanced speed and endurance to a great effect, running faster than a magically-enhanced horse. </p><p>That was not without cost, of course, as it drained my stamina quite quickly. Luckily, I had the solution for it as well.</p><p>[-120 Mana] </p><p>[+1 Biomancy]</p><p>Recovering stamina was supposed to be a simple spell, but with a simple caveat. The stronger the target, the higher the stamina, harder to recover. And considering my stats were averaging around thirty, my recovery required a lot of mana, not that I cared about the expense, when that amount recovered in less than thirty seconds. </p><p>As I moved, detection spells came quite useful. Without Aviada to protect, I was free to sneak around. Especially with the assistance from some arcana spells to erase my smell and suppress my sound, I managed to ambush several dangerous creatures with very valuable ingredients on the way, my pack getting bigger and bigger even if I just took the lightest and most precious pieces.</p><p>However, it was a delight to sneak to a Shadow Wolf, and cut their head with a blast of wind blade, turning the table on the sneaky hunters. For the next hour, I never came across a creature stronger than Class twelve, which was a bit unfortunate. Still, the hunt was plenty, and after the first hour, the items I had picked managed to overwhelm my carrying capacity —if I still wanted to be able to sneak, of course. </p><p>[-7530 Mana]</p><p>[+11 Elemental]</p><p>[+7 Biomancy]</p><p>So, I found a cave, killed the thunder bear that staked its claim, preparing to set up several defenses. At first, I was going to create a temporary spot just to hold for the evening, allowing me to store my items, but then I remembered my last encounter against the necromancers, how I had struggled to hide while I waited for my mana to regenerate. </p><p>I needed better hideouts, I suddenly decided. There’s no guarantee that I wouldn’t have another encounter with the necromancers or another group. Also, having such a spot near the school would be useful I needed to run away. At this point, it wasn’t very likely, but still, I would be more relaxed if I addressed it. </p><p>So, I changed my plan just a bit. Rather than reinforcing the cave itself, I used my earth elemental to dig a tunnel, and once I reached the target depth, I dug myself a large room, enough to host several people for a couple of days without a problem while also storing the desired items. </p><p>After setting up the defenses of my room, the ones in the cave was almost trivial, because unlike the school, I didn’t need to hide it from hundreds of mage that was in close proximity, nor I was afraid of someone accidentally triggering something, allowing me to set up stronger and more aggressive defenses with less effort. I engraved flame traps, quicksands, water bolts, explosions of life energies —in case they try to use undead to trigger— and even tracking arcana missiles… </p><p>[-5420 Mana]</p><p>[+2 Elemental]</p><p>After adding several wards to hide the magical signature of the defenses and any possible occupants, the hideout was ready. I added another hidden exit just in case —a tunnel that traveled even deeper into the earth, rigged with explosives— my new hideout was ready. It was supremely uncomfortable of course, lacking any furniture, but it was safe. I was happy with the result even if it had used almost all the reagents I had collected. </p><p>Safety was important. </p><p>When I moved above ground, my mind was already made up about setting up several more outposts in all directions, but not tonight. Tonight I wanted to hunt… So, I decided to get away from the school even more, as even during the night, the surrounding area wasn’t exactly dangerous. Running was nice, but I wanted to use a new trick. </p><p>So, I spent a great deal of power to create an imitation of a wind elemental —a real one was simply too dangerous, nor I had the time or ability to summon one— and mounted that. It flew close to the earth, easily moving several times my speed, but with a corresponding mana expenditure. In ten minutes, I traveled more than a hundred miles, but also it drained my mana pool almost completely despite the regeneration. </p><p>[-6211 Mana]</p><p>[Mana: 1211 / 3565]</p><p>[+4 Elemental]</p><p>I stopped in a concealed spot and dispelled the pseudo-elemental, taking deep breaths. I needed a more convenient method of fast travel, I decided. Pity that I lacked the ability to construct it. Maybe I should meet with the Enchanter Aviada recommended sooner than later. </p><p>After I rested for five minutes, I started casting wide-area detection spells. I was looking for a big target to test my abilities, maybe something like a Lunar Ursa or even a Goliath that would push me to my limits, when one of my detection spells gave me a result. </p><p>A biomancy-based detection spell… Suddenly, I had more interesting prey to hunt… </p><p>————</p><p>[Level: 23    Experience: 263100 / 276000 </p><p>Strength: 28    Charisma: 38</p><p>Precision: 21    Perception: 25</p><p>Agility: 25     Manipulation: 30</p><p>Speed: 23       Intelligence: 30</p><p>Endurance: 22      Wisdom: 32</p><p>HP: 2737 / 2737\tMana: 3265 / 3565        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [92/100]</p><p>Expert Arcana [75/75]        </p><p>Advanced Subterfuge [50/50]         </p><p>Basic Speech [25/25]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p>",

    "content": "<p>Teasing her further that might not be the smartest choice considering our living conditions for the next month, but after getting a glimpse of her breasts through her sweaty t-shirt, the temptation was too thick to deny. So, instead of pushing the shower door hard to make sure it closed properly, I let it stay cracked, already turning my back when it reached. </p><p>I immediately turned my back, afraid that she would realize I had left the door open intentionally, and get scared. While I removed my sweaty shorts and underwear, my eyes were dancing in the room, hoping to find a reflective surface I could watch the door without being caught, if she gathers the courage to actually peek inside. </p><p>I had already turned on the water, waiting for it to get hot when she did her first pass, but disappearing as quickly as she appeared. I sighed in disappointment as I stepped under the shower, enjoying the blast of water. Maybe I had overestimated the temptation of seeing my body naked, which, I had to admit, was kind of a bummer. I was proud of my body. I had spent a lot of time sculpting it to perfection, but apparently, even for a nerdy little girl, it wasn’t enough to risk the shame of being caught. </p><p>However, that funk didn’t last long, not when I noticed her passing in front of the door twice in very quick succession, each time, her steps getting slower. There was no reason for her to walk around that much, I realized with a smirk, and decided to give her an even better show, though I also wanted to watch her reaction. Pity the metal surface I was using for reflection wasn’t as good. I needed a better excuse to watch her, and also make her watch without fear. </p><p>After a moment of consideration, I came with the perfect excuse. The shampoo. It was my best bet to convince her that I can’t see anything, especially if I turn off the water as well. I quickly shampooed my hair, thick enough to make opening my eyes really ill-advised. Luckily, I did manage to crack it without the pain. I closed the water, left the bubbles on my face, and reached for the bottle of shower gel instead, slowly soaping the rest of my body. The moment was excited enough to make me stand in full-mast, though. </p><p>I was subtly watching the entrance to see whether she would gather sufficient courage to take the step, but that turned out to be unnecessary in terms of observation. The moment she appeared in the doorway, she alerted me to her presence with a soft gasp, a reaction that did wonders to soothe my wounded ego. She panicked at her own reaction, and I acted like I hadn’t noticed her reaction, focusing on the immediate pressure of the moment instead. </p><p>Still, seeing my apparent obliviousness, she decided to stay. Her expression of hesitant arousal was enough to make my shaft even harder, even when she hovered around the corner, ready to dash away any moment; something she appreciated if her focused gaze to my midsection was any indicator. </p><p>Keeping myself from laughing was a challenge, but not as hard as actually keeping myself from starting to playing with myself. The former, I resisted easily, but the latter, I only managed to resist for a minute before I put my hand on my shaft and started playing with myself. It was a way to pay her back, I decided. After all, I spent twenty minutes watching her playing with herself —though I didn’t have the best vantage due to the presence of that inconvenient curtain. </p><p>However, I soon learned that the trick with the curtain wasn’t the only surprise Anna had for me. As she watched me jacking off slowly, she first pressed her legs together, rubbing furiously. Soon, however, she didn’t stay limited to that, and one of her hands slipped under her t-shirt, riding up and pushing the t-shirt up along, revealing her panties —which were as boring as I imagined them to be— and her beautiful stomach that was fitter to a cheerleader than the class nerd. </p><p>Her hand continued to rise up, until her fingers started playing with her breasts under her t-shirt, occasionally pushing it enough to give a glimpse of the underside of her boobs. I was so tempted to invite her to shower, unfortunately, I knew that it would have sent her running away immediately. </p><p>Just as I was sure that it couldn’t be better than getting a partial glimpse of her breasts, her hand in her panties, forcing them to bulge as they tried to accommodate for her presence, dancing furiously. It was a good view, but I decided to throw a curveball to my little voyeur’s plan. I turned my back and turned on the water once more, blasting the shampoo and the soap away. </p><p>As I enjoyed the warmth of the shower once more, I could hear her sliding away with a panicked gasp, something I once again ignored. Instead, I finished my shower, wrapped a thin towel around my waist, and left the shower. Anna was once again on the couch she was using as a bed, covered with her blanket, her e-book reader in hand. </p><p>“Shower is free,” I said, walking toward my bed, still glistening after the shower. </p><p>“Noted,” she answered, giving her best attempt to look engrossed in her book, which impressed me since it was a half-decent effort. </p><p>I said nothing else until I arrived at the separator that was supposed to be my room. I grabbed it, pulled it halfway, then suddenly, I decided to add one last amusing detail to mess with her further, mostly to see how she would react. “I’m going to take an early night, because I want to be awake for the first rays of the morning to do some painting,” I explained, and she used that as an opportunity to raise her gaze, once again ogling my muscles. “I want to apologize for the alarm preemptively, because I’m a really heavy sleeper,” I said, acting like I hadn’t noticed her eyes slipping toward my abs, particularly the exact area where my towel ended… </p><p>“N-noted,” she repeated, this time unable to keep herself stammering. I gave her one last smile and pulled the screen close, once again failing to close it completely. This time, I left a small opening that would allow me to see the room if I watched from the small mirror on my bedside, wondering whether she would be brave —or perverted— enough to act on my supposed heavy sleeping… </p><p>She had walked into the shower, fully dressed, and carrying some extra clothes, as I lay to my bed, closing my eyes. What I said to her, except my supposed inability to wake up easily, was true, after all. I needed to wake up early to catch the morning light. </p><p>Teasing her was amusing, but I was here to make myself a better painter. </p><p>So, I closed my eyes, trying to sleep despite the sound of the water blasting in the shower, and things got even more challenging when she moaned softly, no doubt assuming that the sound of the shower was enough to conceal it —a rather inaccurate assumption that I had no intention of correcting. </p><p>When she finally finished with her shower, I was yet to fell asleep, so I opened my eyes to watch her through the mirror. So, through my cracked eyes, I watched her as she pushed her head out, checking something. “Michael, can I ask you something?” she said in a soft tone, almost a whisper, and I let it go unanswered. “Michael,” she repeated a couple of times, each time a bit louder, but spaces in between. </p><p>I smiled in amusement as I realized what she was doing. She was checking whether my sleep was as deep as I had implied. For a nerd, she was really a little dirty girl. </p><p>She took a deep breath after her repeated attempts provided no result —or provided the exact result she had been expecting— and her head disappeared back in the shower. I kept my eyes open, still watching her from the reflection, glad that my partition was too dark for her to notice my gaze even if she had noticed the conveniently-placed mirror. </p><p>Then, she stepped out of the shower. </p><p>It took a great deal of effort from my end not to react, because she was wearing nothing more than a small towel as well, a towel that was wrapped around her waist, leaving her breasts naked, still glistening after the shower. I could myself growing harder even as she took a step forward, her tits jiggling perfectly as she finally stepped out of my field of vision. </p><p>How the hell she failed to get herself a boyfriend with that body was a mystery. </p><p>I cursed myself for peeking, not because I felt guilty, but because after getting that glimpse, listening to the way the fabric rustled against her voluptuous body was pure torture. Then, she passed through my field of view once again, this time wearing her underwear. Like her normal clothes, her underwear was the most boring it could be, white panties wide enough to cover her amazing ass and an equally large beige bra that managed to cover her breasts. Still, despite that, she was an arousing sight. </p><p>I closed my eyes, trying to catch some sleep, which was a struggle after the rush of seeing her half-naked. Still, after half an hour, it seemed like I was about to succeed. The darkness slowly crept in, and I was about to fall asleep, when I heard the distinctive sound of a curtain moving. The curtain was responsible for separating my bed from the rest of the RV. </p><p>I kept my eyes closed determinedly, curious what my naughty little guest had in mind. I had to admit, when I felt my covers slowly sliding to the side, I was rather surprised with her reaction, my shaft reacting to the idea immediately. </p><p>Curiosity was a dangerous emotion, and I was feeling very curious about what she had in mind, in particular, her limits. I kept my eyes closed as the covers slid lower, revealing my stomach. Only after they passed the critical point, revealing my shaft to her —and earning a rather loud gasp— I cracked my eyes open slightly to watch her.</p><p>Whatever I had in mind, she managed to surprise me greatly with her body illuminated by the dim light coming from behind, giving an ethereal quality to her body. She was still wearing her underwear, and only her underwear. Even then, it couldn’t be classified as wearing. It was more accurate to say that her underwear was on her body. Her panties were around one of her thighs, bunched up, giving me a fleeting glimpse of her entrance before she covered it with her hand, cutting my view —not that I was dissatisfied by it when it started dancing at her entrance. </p><p>Her bra was in a similar state of uselessness. It was already hooked, dangling uselessly from one arm, leaving her tits naked for my viewing pleasure. Pity that I couldn’t get more than a glimpse without alerting her. Despite playing with herself, she was quite tense, aware of the risk she was taking —but unaware that she had been caught long ago. </p><p>I continue to lay silently, not making a peep, giving her confidence that my claim about being a heavy sleeper was correct. </p><p>However, I realized that I might have been too convincing, I decided when I felt something being wrapped around my shaft. Once again, I decided to take the risk and peep a bit, catching the beautiful figure of Anna even closer, but luckily, turned sideways, removing the risk of getting caught as I examined her beautiful ass and her smooth back. </p><p>Rejecting the temptation to slap her ass to test its potential to jiggle was difficult, especially when her hand started moving up and down around my shaft, making me enjoy her clumsy attempts of handjob —but made even more erotic by that reason. The fact that it was clearly her first time touching a cock, and she was horny enough to do that in the middle of the night, completely naked and playing with herself, made the situation even more exciting. </p><p>I was tempted to inform her that her forays hadn’t been as secretive as she had assumed, curious about her reaction. But watching her fumble while she thought herself to be sneaky was too amusing to actually miss. I continued watching the way her ass jiggled whenever her jolts of pleasure got too much, her movements making me closer to the climax. </p><p>Almost ten minutes passed like that, enough time for even her unskilled attempts at handjob to push me closer to the edge. But then, she decided to surprise me even more. When she pulled her hand away from my shaft and cupped her own breasts —the other still carefully teasing her own clit-- I felt disappointed. </p><p>Then, she leaned forward, her lips already parted open, and captured the crown of my shaft. She started moving up and down, the fumbling of her fingers replaced by the fumbling of her tongue, equally unskilled, but even more erotic. I was already close to the edge, and her lips allowed me to cover the distance. </p><p>The panicked yelp she let out when I started spraying into her mouth was delicious. She pulled back in panic, but it only resulted with her receiving another blast on her face, while a third spread around the room. She looked around panicked, then noticed her bra, but rather than trying to pull it away, she chose to lean with that, receiving another load to her breasts before she could wrap her bra around my shaft, absorbing the rest.</p><p>Holding my laughter at her panicked expression while she examined my ruined covers was a challenge, but luckily, I managed to hold. She stood frozen, looking at the stained sheet and my body. She looked like a hungover girl who had woken up in a cell, her memories returning slowly. </p><p>“Damn, damn, damn…” she murmured to herself panickedly as the implications of her actions slowly pushed themselves in her mind. She looked around, until she saw the wet wipes that were sitting on the kitchen table. She dashed to them, pulling a bunch generously before running back. </p><p>I was very satisfied with that particular action, because she was still naked, each step making her deliciously tight body jiggle beautifully. How I wished to dig my fingers into her breasts, testing their firmness firsthand, but unfortunately, that wasn’t a viable option, not if I didn’t want to scare her off. </p><p>I wanted to see just how far she would go when she thought to be unobserved. </p><p>She reached down, too focused on the stains on the covers to notice the amazing show she was providing, her concentration impenetrable. Her determination faded somewhat when it came to clean my body, however, clearly considering the relative risks of me waking up with the clear signs of an ‘accident’ the night before versus the depth of my sleep and the possibility of it sustaining the touch of a wet napkin. </p><p>The way she rocked back and forth as she tried to decide, biting her lips, would have been cute if it wasn’t for her nakedness. Instead, it was intensely erotic, enough to make my cock twitch in enthusiasm, slowly rising for a second round. She watched that development with rapt attention. For a moment, I hoped that she was going for a second round, but when her fingers touched my shaft once more, our skin was separated by a wet napkin. </p><p>Pity, I thought as I watched her leave after finishing cleaning the mess she created, and pulled my curtains close. Not that I was feeling sad. It was just the first night of a month-long journey. </p><p>I couldn’t wait for her next surprise… </p>",

    "content": "<p>I cast a simple silencing spell as I moved forward and nothing else. I was confident in my abilities that the barmaid would be unable to leave the pantry for the next several minutes after our delicious encounter. Even walking would be challenging. </p><p>However, when I closed into my prospective assassin, I met with a very unwelcome sight. He was trembling badly, foaming from his mouth. Even worse, he turned to me, a grim, vindictive smile on his face. “Fuck,” I murmured as I dashed forward, hoping to save him, only to fail. When I arrived next to him, he was already dead.</p><p>“Fuck, fuck, fuck…” I murmured even as I cast a contained flame spell to burn his body, but knowing that I was already too late. I had miscalculated badly. When he used the Nectar of Pluto to poison me, I had assumed that his employer used his connection to get access to the poison. </p><p>The fanatic determination he showed, committing suicide the moment he was caught, was a completely unexpected development. It meant that he was an Adept of Pluto, meaning he had actually received training in the Temple of the God of the Underworld, enough to embrace their fanaticism. </p><p>It was why I burned his body without bothering to do a search. If he was willing to commit suicide, he wouldn’t be stupid enough to carry critical documents on his body. </p><p>The moment his body turned to ashes, I cast an earth spell, forcing his ashes to create one small clump, and cast an air spell to disperse the smell. I noticed an interesting reaction as I cast elemental spells, like I was swimming against the tide, making my casting slightly difficult. It wasn’t immediately important considering the marked increase in my casting abilities, but still, it was something I needed to ponder when I had some time. </p><p>Unfortunately, time was something I was going to lack for the foreseeable future. I had been just targeted by an Adept of Pluto. I wasn’t scared of him, or any other Adept of Pluto, as at best, they were peripheral members of the Temple of the Underworld with relatively limited capabilities. The real problem lay with the mystery person that could send an Adept of Pluto to find me in a few days. </p><p>I was afraid of who else was going to end up targeting me if I continued to stay. </p><p>The moment I erased the evidence of the recent suicide, I cast a spell to make myself harder to notice, and dashed upstairs, where my wards had stopped sending me signals of being under attack. Since they were far too sturdy to be taken down in a minute, it meant that the Adept had managed to send his accomplices a signal, and they pulled back. </p><p>Pity that I didn’t have time to hunt them, especially since I didn’t even know just how many there were. </p><p>In the upstairs, I burst in, waking up the girls. “Quick, get ready, we have been found,” I said inside. </p><p>“By who,” Astrid murmured while Lillian looked at me in shock, afraid of my reaction. </p><p>“No time to explain, quickly get ready, we’re leaving in two minutes,” I said sharply even as I grabbed the nearest bag and started stuffing it with whatever that looked convenient, including cutlery and a blanket. Not because I had a burning need for a dinner knife, but the raw material was sure to be useful. </p><p>My tone and my hurried actions seemed to be convincing enough, because both jumped up to their feet —and giving me an excellent glimpse of their naked bodies in the process, still carrying the marks of my rough treatment during our earlier encounter. Unfortunately, they dressed quickly, denying me the beautiful sight. While they dressed, I pulled the bedcovers, tying them together to improvise a rope. </p><p>Two minutes later, they were fully dressed and holding half-filled bags, trying to fill them completely. “It’s time, let’s move,” I said. </p><p>“Our bags-” Lillian started, but I gestured her to stop. The time was more important than some extra knick-knack, especially since we needed to travel light. </p><p>“That’s enough, we need to move,” I said, and to their surprise, didn’t walk toward the door. Instead, I walked to the window, and dangled the rope from the window, a rune on one end stabilizing it against the floor of our room. They looked surprised at my decision, but luckily, they didn’t have any other questions. </p><p>The moment I pushed my head out of the window, I was already drenched by the merciless pouring of the rain. But it wasn’t the time to care about the discomfort. I started climbing down using the rope, only to hear the distinctive sound of an arrow, cutting through the air. With the concealment of the pouring rain, I barely noticed the arrow in time. A wave of my hand created a gust of wind that forced the arrow to go wide. “He’s out in the back,” shouted an archer even as he nicked another arrow to his bow, hidden behind a cover, and a magical shield gleamed around him. The torrent helped him to stay concealed as well. </p><p>I was tempted to blast him even though it was a bad idea. The shield around him looked strong enough that I had to launch a concentrated assault before my ascension to break through before my Ascension. As a Sorcerer, breaking it wouldn’t even make me sweat, but it would reveal my power. </p><p>Considering the mystery of our opponent, hiding was the better option. </p><p>So, no matter how much it displeased me, I couldn’t eviscerate him. That didn’t mean I was without an option, however. I pointed my finger at him, and shouted, “Fulgur.” I tried to cast a simple lightning spell, one weak enough to barely jolt an unshielded person. I chose that, because it looked flashy, enough to scare the archer. </p><p>However, the effect wasn’t exactly what I wanted. Remembering the earlier resistance I suffered while casting fire and earth-based elemental spells, I put some extra power behind the lightning spell, not wanting it to fizzle halfway due to the rain. While lightning wasn’t a part of the traditional core elements, I had no reason to believe that it wouldn’t be affected the same. </p><p>So, I was shocked when the crackling bolt of lightning landed on the archer’s shield, threatening to make it collapse. </p><p>“What the hell,” I murmured even as I continued to climb down, while the archer rolled behind a building. I moved fast, wanting to use the archer’s distraction to my benefit. Still, even as my feet connected to the ground, I was trying to understand the change. Unlike the reluctance of the other elements, the lightning that departed my finger was almost enthusiastic, several times stronger than necessary. </p><p>And it was new, at least for me. While I had seen some people in the school with a preference toward a certain element, it usually came from habits and laziness. The flexibility of their spells differed, but not the strength, especially when it came to lightning, which was always more volatile compared to four traditional elements. I couldn’t help but remember the shower of lightning I had gone through during my Ascension, saving my life in the process. </p><p>It was hard to argue against the link between two phenomena. </p><p>However, I wasn’t able to think much about that, because almost a dozen armed men walked into the backyard, some carrying bows, the other carrying javelins, their weapons drawn and ready to be let loose. Their weapons were well-crafted, and some of them were glowing with magical runes. They had an impressive arsenal. </p><p>Their silent cooperation was scarier. They moved without caring about their flanks, confident that their brothers-in-arm had their back. It sounded simple, but it was anything but. It was something that could be only forged through countless life-and-death encounters. </p><p>Or military training, I realized when I noticed the matching tattoos on the arms of four of them, the only four that were wearing short-sleeved shirts. The rest wore coats or long-sleeved shirts that hid their right shoulder. I was going to take a wild guess and say that they were ex-legionnaires, which didn’t surprise me much after facing against an Adept of Pluto. For anyone with that kind of clout, hiring retired legionnaires was a simple affair. </p><p>“Come down quickly, I’m going to defend,” I shouted with a desperation that was rather unnecessary considering my strength. Yes, the legionnaires were scary opponents that deserved their reputation several times over, but their overwhelming dominance only mattered when fighting against other soldiers. </p><p>Under normal conditions, a squad —or if I was going to refer them with their proper name, contubernium— contained eight fighting men, and in a fair skirmish, a contubernium could be treated as the same strength as a proficient mage. I wouldn’t bet on Lillian against a contubernium of course, as while she had the necessary strength, she lacked the real battle experience to fight against eight seasoned legionaries. </p><p>Still, thanks to my grandfather’s psychotic training, even before I joined the Hall of Saturn, I could take down one-and-half contubernium with ease. My shout of panic had the same aim as my panicked lightning spell. I wanted to convince them I was prey that they could take down if they could corner me. </p><p>A small shower of ranged attacks joined the merciless torrent of rain, targeting me rather than the girls. Luckily, most of the attacks veered of the target thanks to horrible visibility, and the rest, I sent away with another gust of wind. </p><p>Seeing that their ranged assault was ineffective, eight of them pulled their gladiuses, raised their shields, and charged forward, the other four waiting with their bows drawn. </p><p>I cast another lightning spell, this time with an area effect, but I put much less power behind it this time. Even then, when it collided with the magic-resistant shields of the legionaries, it pushed them back, giving the girls enough time to stand on their ground as well. “Go toward the gate, I’ll protect the flank,” I shouted at the girls as I pointed at the small wooden gate as I made a show of slouching down after my earlier spell.  </p><p>We moved together toward the gate while I cast several wind spells to disperse their ranged attacks, my apparent exhaustion getting more and more pronounced, especially when they started raining their arrows in a staggered manner, forcing me to cast more spells. </p><p>It was a smart strategy. Too bad that they were working on a faulty assumption. </p><p>We arrived at the gate after a minute of walking through thick mud on the ground, but our pursuers stayed closed, guard post already empty. It was smart on the guards' end, avoiding being stuck in our battle. </p><p>“Surrender, and we’ll have mercy on you,” called one of them even as they moved forward as a group, their shields raised. </p><p>“Mercy of the blade?” I asked with a scoff as I sent another weak lightning spell, pushing them back once more. </p><p>“It’s better than ending in a torturers’ table, or in a slave pit,” answered the man, which was technically correct. Being captured by the Romans in battle was never a good fate. With the skills I had displayed, I was destined to end up in Colosseum, fighting endless battles against captured monsters and fellow slaves. </p><p>In such an environment, all it took was one mistake to end up dead. </p><p>“Thanks for your kind offer, but I’m going to take my chances,” I shouted before turning to Lillian and whispering. “Hold them back for thirty seconds. Use wide-range defensive spells and don’t worry about exhausting yourself,” I said. The last thing I needed was Lillian to try copying my staggered wind defense, only to end up in an arrow in the neck for mistiming. </p><p>Then, I turned my attention to the gate and started drawing a number of runes on it. The gate was magically-reinforced, of course, but since it was designed to hold the attackers from outside, it was much weaker from our side. Still, rather than simply blasting it down, I started drawing runes to crack it down. I had already shown a rather impressive ability in runic magic, from our first escape from the pirate ship to trapping the Adept. With any luck, they would assume that I had somehow trapped the dragon serpent in a runic scheme and killed it as well. </p><p>“Attack!” called the leader with a great urgency after watching me for a couple of seconds, smart enough to realize the urgency of the attack. </p><p>Breaking the defensive scheme of the gate took me thirty seconds. “Brace,” I called as forced the door to explode. The resulting explosion shook the ground enough to make everyone stumble —not helped by the thick, slippery mud on the ground— but no other harm occurred because I had designed the runes to deflect the explosion outward. </p><p>I grabbed the girls and forced them onto their feet before we started running, finally stepping outside of the wooden palisade of the trading post. Astrid was able to run in her own strength, but Lillian was already stumbling. The defense clearly took a lot from her. </p><p>“Delay them, the rest of the century will be here in a few minutes,” called their leader. “We can’t let the others have the honor. It rightfully belongs to us.” </p><p>“Try harder,” I said even as I triggered the runes I had left on the door, just as they were about to pass through the gate, though the trap strong enough to kill them. I wanted to show-off with my runic aptitude, but breaching a magical gate in thirty seconds was impressive enough, but setting up a trap strong enough to kill twelve legionaries without any external power source would have pushed the bounds of credulity. </p><p>Still, it was a pity that I wasn’t able to kill them, because I really didn’t like it when their leader mentioned their century, for several reasons. First, being hunted by eighty well-equipped and disciplined legionaries wasn’t exactly comforting. Second, it implied that they were still active soldiers rather than retired ones, which had very dangerous implications about the identity and strength of my mysterious enemy. </p><p>Third, he mentioned competition for a reward, which meant that their century wasn’t the only one that was hunting us. I could go and hope that he was thinking the tribe we had fought earlier or the raiders when he said so, but my instincts told me that those words fueled with pride of competition, something a legionnaire would rarely feel against bandits and tribals. </p><p>It meant that we had more than one century in our tail. </p><p>We might be even dealing with a full cohort, which had six centuries. Almost five hundred fighting men, probably with some auxiliaries, which might include cavalry, engineers, and even several war mages. </p><p>Worst, a cohort was always led by an experienced Sorcerer. </p><p>For the first time since my Ascension, I felt the pressure of a deadly threat. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Not exploding into an amused chuckle was one of the hardest things I had ever managed to accomplish in my life, especially when I could feel Emma exuding shame and arousal in my mind in equal amounts, both several times thicker than the sense of accomplishment she felt in my mind. </p><p>I waited with great interest as she stayed in my mind, battling with her own emotions, trying to decide whether she wanted to continue or pull back. Then, she took a deep breath, and her determination intensified, signaling her answer. </p><p>Curious, I thought, even as I started playing with the memory that kept the second key in. I could have tortured her with some of the more intense memories from my battles, but compared to the other possibilities, it was plain boring. Instead, I picked a memory where I went swimming with my bodyguards —a pair of sexy blonde twins that were as skillful in the bed as they were skilled in combat magic— a session that started with skinny-dipping and ended in all three of us collapsing, exhausted after a couple of hours of aggressive lovemaking… </p><p>As Emma’s mental probe moved through my sea of memories —and occasionally touching other sexy memories that I had intentionally put on her way. At first, she just jerked away from those memories, the touch-only lasting for a moment. However, after the first few, her mental agility suffered suspiciously, and the contacts started to last for a couple of seconds before separation, each making her face blush more. </p><p>The real surprise, however, was the second memory. The moment she touched it, she was sucked inside, and found herself unable to extract herself, forced the watch the memory from beginning to end, uninterrupted… </p><p>Even though the memory flow was several times higher than real life, it still meant that I had around ten minutes where I could act without her attention. I cut my finger, and started writing several more blood runes, carefully guiding my magic into the cracks of the chains. I was careful not to flare my magic, not wanting to alert Emma to what was going on, not to mention I didn’t want to damage the surface of the chains. </p><p>Instead, I used the previous cracks to reach the core of the chains, drilling them carefully but steadily, until I was confident that the crack was large enough that I could finish the job alone. And just like that, completing the first step of my freedom journey. </p><p>Such an occasion deserved a celebration. </p><p>Luckily, Emma had volunteered for my celebration. As she was stuck in the memory, forced to watch the full event while experiencing the echoes of emotions, her face was red, her breathing out of control. She was even letting out occasional moans, no louder than a whisper, but still enough to make my shaft throb. </p><p>She was surprisingly naughty, I noted, especially I realized one of her hands reached to her blouse, and cupped her breast over her blouse, leveraging her lack of a bra to maximum effectiveness. Her soft moans got louder in an instant, but her eyes were still closed as she gave her full focus on the memory itself, while her struggles to make the memory stop fading away… </p><p>In her defense, her reaction was very much justified. The show I had put together that day had been rather spectacular, fucking my sexy twin bodyguards into a pleasure-filled land of unconsciousness through an impressive number of positions, and she was getting an accelerated show of it. </p><p>Soon, things got even more heated as her other hand joined the first, and started mauling her breasts recklessly. I decided to help her a bit, and cast a spell —slowly and carefully not to alert her with the mana flare— preventing her from climaxing through her own efforts. It was a rather invasive spell that would have been noticed if her mental focus wasn’t currently in my sea of consciousness, enjoying the show I was putting on. </p><p>This vulnerability was the exact reason she tried to ensure I would stay unconscious through several potions. </p><p>With that done, I lay back, enjoying the show as she played with herself, unaware of my observation. When the memory ended, her eyes opened immediately rather than trying to move back toward the treasure chest in my mind. Her irises wide, and she was gasping repeatedly, but her hands were still on her breasts, desperately squeezing. </p><p>I subtly observed her from my cracked eyelids, feeling a bit frustrated as well. How could I not feel like that, when Emma had interrupted the delicious handjob I had been receiving, only to provide me an amazing show of her playing with herself. The frustrated but erotic growl that escaped her mouth made my cock twitch, but luckily, she had other priorities. </p><p>“Fucking bastard,” she murmured a few seconds later, but she wasn’t looking at my face. No, instead, her gaze fell down between my legs, where my shaft was creating an intimidating sight. “It’s such a degenerate thing to do, hiding the keys of your thoughts in such impure scenes. Unfortunately for you, my teacher is right. I have a natural talent for mental spells, and I’m going to strip down all of your secrets. No matter how disgusting the process is!” she said loudly. </p><p>Of course, her angry monologue that was mired with insults would have been more believable if she stopped playing with her tits as she delivered her words. Instead, she made it obvious that her anger was just a clutch for her to deny reality. </p><p>However, I was more interested in the identity of her so-called teacher who had told her that she had natural talent toward mind magic, because it simply wasn’t true. If she had entered into my mind while I was actually unconscious, even with the help from the potions, she would have been hurt as bad as me, maybe even worse. So, either her teacher was completely incompetent, or malicious. I didn’t know which was true, nor I wanted to waste my time considering it, because my attention was grabbed by the sudden movement of her hand. </p><p>Her hand disappeared under her skirt, while riding it up in the process enough to give me a beautiful glimpse of the fair skin of her inner thighs, begging to be bitten to leave a red mark of ownership. While the skirt prevented me from seeing under her skirt, I could still listen to the wet slipping of her hands while she searched for a release that continued to avoid her desire. </p><p>Unfortunately for her, I had long ensured that her search would be fruitless, building her arousal more with each passing second. “Fuck,” she moaned after ten minutes of effort while continuing to play with herself. Her gaze fell on my face, but this time, reflecting a mixture of anger and desire. “It’s all your fault, I can’t keep those memories away from my mind.” </p><p>She took a deep breath as she crouched next to me, one hand still between her legs but the one that was on her chest slid away, giving me an amazing view of her cleavage once more, this time crowned with her erect nipples. “It’s all your fault,” she repeated, like she was trying to encourage herself. “And I’m sure that your memories about your body are inaccurate, just a delusion of yours. A monster like you could never have such a body…” she murmured, anger on her tone not matching with the desperate movements of her fingers as she unbuttoned my shirt before starting to caress my muscles, which started from my chest, and moved downward in determination. </p><p>After hanging around my abs for a long while, caressing the edges like she tried to convince herself that there were real, she suddenly removed my pants, revealing my shaft immediately, making her the second member of Lancelot’s party of Good to wrap her fingers around my naked shaft. Lancelot was really neglecting his lady friends…</p><p>As a guest, I owed him to pick the slack. </p><p>I watched as Emma slowly caressed my shaft, no more skilled than Aria when it came to proper technique, but learning even faster, probably because she had watched several of my memories, giving her a lot of experience. </p><p>Unfortunately, rather than continuing the task at hand, she murmured something about lacking time before delving into my mind, looking for the next fragment of memory with a key. On the positive side, she kept her hand on my shaft, although motionless. </p><p>For the third memory, I had a really good surprise for her. This time, the main actress of my memory was a sexy brunette. One that Emma knew intimately. The moment she touched at the memory, she jerked back in shock, her eyes wide. She collapsed on the floor, unaware —or uncaring— of her skirt sprawling revealingly, giving me a glimpse of her panties —red, lacy, and very revealing. The Queen was right sending her away, as Emma seemed really prepared to go forward with the seduction game tonight. </p><p>“It cannot be! It was … Valkyrie…” she murmured in shock, while I focused on the beautiful view. Her shock was understandable, as the identity of my co-star on that particular memory justified her overreaction. </p><p>Valkyrie was the nickname of one of the most famous holy knights that operated around the borderlands. She had a reputation for righteousness and a single-minded focus on the light. She was also famous for singlehandedly destroying several critical locations for Dark Faction, which made her effectively untouchable for her area of operation politically. </p><p>Most didn’t know that I had a very profitable agreement with her that was going on for the last ten years. I made sure to inform her about some of the more attention-grabbing members of the Dark Army, the kind that thought that killing people was their mission, and Valkyrie was more than happy to ambush and kill them. She got the reputation and saved the people at the same time, while I made sure that my army lacked rebellious members. What she did couldn’t even be considered treason, because without her convenient presence, I might have chosen to send these guys on a dangerous mission, and their death would have been bought by many more deaths from the good faction. That deal was pure convenience. </p><p>Of course, the particular way we chose to seal that deal was less pure. Valkyrie had a particularly devout army that saw her unable to make a mistake, and having sex with any of them would have ruined her reputation. Which, funnily enough, made me the safest choice for a tryst. </p><p>For me, defiling a holy knight was its own reward. </p><p>Seeing Emma’s shocked face was no less entertaining, though, especially since even as she muttered in shock. “It can’t be, I must have seen it wrong,” she murmured in shock even as she put one of her hands to my temple once more, this time, the other resting on her own thigh, still riding her skirt up, tempting me to be naughty. </p><p>This time, I decided to fulfill those instincts. When her mental presence arrived at the location pf the memory once more, I made sure that she would stay in place until the memory finished, then I brazenly reached to her blouse and pushed the right sleeve down until her shoulder was naked, also finally revealing her perky breast to my sight completely, some. </p><p>She looked beautiful, so beautiful that I actually wanted to push for more. I reached and sank my fingers into her breast, and she moaned reflexively while her own hand moved automatically and disappeared under her skirt, once again the wet sounds of her treatment reaching to my ears. My heart was thumping hard, afraid that I would be noticed, which would have forced me to take certain actions that I prefer not to take, but luckily, Emma was far too interested in my memory to actually count the number of the hands dancing over her body. </p><p>“Oh, yes,” she moaned, her pleasure getting more and more prevalent, especially since my own touch wasn’t being limited by the spell, instead of helping her toward her orgasm. Still, that service was not without a cost. I reached the other shoulder of her blouse and pushed it to the side, making her top slide low enough to leave her tits completely naked, jumping up and down enthusiastically whenever her finger slipped inside her. </p><p>Since she didn’t react to that as well, I grabbed the side of her skirt, and folded a couple of times before stuffing it to her waist, giving me a direct sight of her beautiful slit —naked other than a beautiful strip of red, like a delicious arrow leading me for the target. </p><p>Pity that it was still a bit early for that. </p><p>Of course, just because I couldn’t complete the game didn’t mean that I couldn’t turn on the heat further. I grabbed her wrist and gently pulled her hand to my shaft, making her move up and down, while I took the role of her fingers with my own, dipping them into her wetness. </p><p>She moaned loudly when I circled her clit, her wetness increasing further, almost to the point of gushing freely, turning her sexy panties completely damp. I pulled my fingers for a moment, putting them against her lips, aroused by the way she was sucking them unconsciously. When I started fingering her once more, I delivered that with a rapid, merciless assault, enough to finally trigger her climax the moment she finished viewing the memory of me and Valkyrie. </p><p>The moment her loud cry exploded in the room, I immediately pulled my fingers away, and continued feigning sleep. Luckily, for the first few seconds, her eyes stayed closed, giving me the time to shift into the mood. </p><p>“Fuck,” she gasped as she leaned forward, grabbing the chair next to her just to make sure she hadn’t collapsed while she trembled uncontrollably, the delayed orgasm hitting her with the full strength of a raging tornado. “That’s a big one.” </p><p>I watched as she took several breaths before turning her angry glare at me. “It’s all your fault,” she murmured, but I didn’t panic. Because her reaction would have been much more explosive if she suspected me of actually doing something like that. </p><p>She sighed as she fixed her skirt, likely assuming that she had done that between memories, then, before fixing her blouse, she used the chains on me once more. “I can’t believe that the Valkyrie, the foremost holy knight of the borderlands would do something like that,” she murmured dazedly. </p><p>“At least she didn’t betray the light,” she added a bit later, when her gaze fell on my shaft. “All she did was to use your degenerate ways to help the Empire.” She took another deep breath. “If considered from that aspect, she is a saintess, suffering humiliation and degradation just to save our soldiers.” </p><p>Suppressing my laughter took a lot from me, as in that memory, our dear Valkyrie’s expression didn’t exactly shout heroic suffering, though of course, I could be misreading the meaning of multiple orgasms. Emma was trying to rewrite the narration of the memory, and the reason was clear. She wanted to assuage her own guilt by doing so. </p><p>After all, masturbating the naughty memories of a Dark Lord, defiling a heroic warrior of the light was not exactly proper. </p><p>She buttoned my shirt, but before pulling on my pants, she murmured to herself. “It would be suspicious if I leave you like this, especially after I forced you to relive all those memories,” she murmured, once again not exactly a rational statement, but she didn’t look like she cared about rationality when she leaned down, and grabbed my shaft between her lips, her hand immediately between her legs. </p><p>I wouldn’t say that she delivered the best blowjob I had ever received, but considering how backed I was after the extended game with Princess Aria, followed by another charged hour with Emma where I had spent several minutes enjoying the sight of her naked breasts while leveraged my fingers to fulfill her needs, it wasn’t shocking that I exploded into her mouth a minute after her lips first touched my shaft. </p><p>“What the-” she gasped as she pulled back, shocked, but the only result was my shaft coming free, and a new burst exploded on her beautiful face. She put her hand to reign the flow, but succeeded only after receiving a fresh blast to her still-naked chest. “Bastard,” she murmured angrily —which, considering she was coated with my seed, made her even sexier— “Even unconscious, you’re nothing but trouble,” she added, like it wasn’t her that was molesting a prisoner, one that she assumed to be unconscious, even. </p><p>“Fucking asshole,” she murmured as she pulled a napkin and carefully cleaned her face and breasts before fixing her clothes, then cleaned my shaft to get rid of the evidence. </p><p>“I need to finish exploring the memory tomorrow,” she murmured as she left my cell, leaving me alone. </p><p>The moment she locked the door, I focused on my chains. Thanks to the changes I managed to implement, after several hours of careful treatment, the chains clicked open. I was finally free. </p><p>The question, should I go for a midnight patrol. It was risky, but learning a bit more about the political situation would help… </p>",

    "content": "<p> I couldn’t help but smile as I followed Elva into the pantry, which required me to take the stairs down. Even the subtle movement of my assassin didn’t change my mind, not when a voluptuous blonde awaited me at the other side of the door. </p><p>Still, I stood in front of the door for a moment, drawing several runes in rapid succession, and they glowed for a moment before fading away. I looked at them like a painter who just created his masterpiece, fascinated because before my ascension, powering these runes would have taken at least ten minutes, and would have left me panting in exhaustion. </p><p>Satisfied with the trap, I added one last rune to hide its magical signature before opening the door and slipping inside the pantry. “Hello, beautiful,” I said with a smirk. </p><p>“Can I help you?” Elva asked, but considering a couple of extra buttons were removed during her walk, it didn’t exactly imply being hard to get. I couldn’t help but lick my lips at this young local beauty, sexy enough to make my mouth water. </p><p>“Yes,” I answered, increasing the pressure of my magic with every step, entertained by the way her arousal rose to match every raise. I pointed at my bulge, and her eyes flicked down, widening enough to show her appreciation. “Do you want to start here?” </p><p>She flushed, barely able to keep still under the combined assault of my magical presence and my erection. She licked her lips. “You think that just because…” she started, but the heat of her first word was quick to fade away, and we reached the fifth word, she fell silent. </p><p>“Yes, I think that,” I answered confidently even as I closed in the distance. Her arousal was already obvious, and I only had a few minutes before my assassin dropped by and triggered the trap. I didn’t have any time to waste. “Now, come and handle it,” I said and sat on a crate just a foot away from her. “Of course, you can refuse, and I can turn and leave. I don’t have much time. I’m going to leave in an hour, so this is your only chance.” </p><p>“I don’t-” she started, but I immediately started standing up. She dashed forward, her hands on my shoulders. “Wait a minute,” she added enthusiastically, before murmuring. “I guess … we can do it.” She took a deep breath. “It’s my responsibility that you have a good time, especially after that horrible attack.” </p><p>We were both aware that the attack was nothing more than a momentary entertainment, but if she wanted to use it as an excuse to get herself going, who was I to argue… “Excellent, then take my cock out of my pants,” I ordered with a sharp tone. Since my transformation, I was feeling the urge to act more domineering, and while I had to take care of Astrid and Lillian, ensuring that their mood was accurate, the same wasn’t the case for this tasty side piece. </p><p>She looked shocked, looking whether she heard it right? \"Pardon me?\" she gasped, beginnings of an outrage coloring her tone.</p><p>\"You heard me, I said take my cock out of my pants--now!\" I repeated. I was even quieter than the last time, but the aura of command was unmistakable. </p><p>“You can’t be serious,” she stammered in shock, but her buckling knees was a better answer. </p><p>I decided to reinforce my message. “You have five seconds. Either obey or leave.” I was threatening to kick her out of her own pantry, but from the trembling —and aroused— the expression on her face, I was willing to bet that she had forgotten that particular nugget of information. </p><p>The emotions danced on her face, outrage and self-respect suffering under the merciless assault of her arousal and her primal desire to fulfill the needs of the stronger presence. She was transparent as she considered her alternatives, but in the end, there was only one option. She crouched down, her fingers trembling as they found the button of my pants, and slowly revealed my shaft. I expected the rustling of the fabric to be the only emotion in the room, but her gasp caught me surprised. </p><p>“Underwear as well,” I reminded her, but she stalled for a second, caught surprised by the continuing growth of my bulge. </p><p>“It’s still growing,” she murmured in fascination. </p><p>“Of course it does,” I answered with a smug smile. “Why don’t you act quick and catch it before it gets bored and goes back to sleep.” </p><p>She tried to send an angry gaze, but once again, it barely lasted a second. She reached for my underwear and pulled it slowly. Her breath quickened as my shaft was finally revealed with all its glory. She was hesitant as she wrapped her hand around it, her fingers not meeting around my girth. </p><p>“Suck it!” I ordered, and despite my dismissive tone, she immediately followed my command, leaning forward and capturing the first few inches necessary, covering the head of my shaft with her beautiful lips. She struggled with the size, or at least, that was what I assumed the sudden mumbling was about, but that didn’t prevent her blue eyes from shining in enthusiasm. </p><p>“Not a bad start, but swallow more,” I ordered, and she tried to follow my order, even when the crown hit the entrance of her throat. Her mouth opened wide, enough to cause her some discomfort. “Excellent work, slut,” I ordered. “Now, go even deeper. I want your throat around my shaft, like you’re nothing but a common whore. </p><p>This managed to rouse her anger, to the point that she tried to pull back, but I was ready. I grabbed the back of her head, and pushed her down, invading her throat, leaving her nothing but gag and slobber helplessly, trying not to choke.” </p><p>\"Excellent,\" I said. \"Suck it, suck my monster cock with those pretty ruby lips. You like when I use you as a slave, don't you, whore? I've seen you look at it. Admit it, you wanted to suck my cock the moment I walked in the bar.” </p><p>She moaned, which barely sounded like disagreement, though if she was unhappy with my insults, neither the way she was sucking my cock nor her pleasure-filled eyes gave an indication of it. She seemed to like my insults. </p><p>“Let’s see your assets, whore,” I said, more than happy to continue the trend. I reached down and placed my hands on her large breasts, even the rough texture of her poor-quality top unable to distract from her softness. She moaned, her mouth tightening around my shaft, for a moment, making me afraid of her teeth, but luckily, she managed to control herself. I grabbed her nipples, twisting them freely, each turn making her moan harder, even when I squeezed hard enough to hurt. </p><p>She was definitely a rare find. </p><p>I was tempted to rip her blouse clean off her body, but considering she had to walk through a crowded room full of horny men, I decided to take mercy, and instead quickly unbuttoned her shirt, leaving her naked breasts underneath without any kind of support. I let her open shirt on her body, sinking my fingers on her beautiful breasts instead, earning a desperate moan from her. I squeezed hard enough to leave my mark, uncaring whether she had a husband or boyfriend she had to hide them from. Her clothes were the full extent of my mercy. </p><p>However, from the moans that rose as I mauled her large, milky breasts mercilessly, twisting her naked nipples, it didn’t seem like she had a problem with it. The mixture of pleasure and pain working excellently on her, to the point that she looked closer to a climax than I was. </p><p>That would not do, I suddenly decided as I let her go. She pulled away, trying to breathe, and I used the opportunity to slide her shirt off her body, but not completely. When it forced her arms behind her back, I twisted her shirt, turning it into a primitive chain, immobilizing her hands behind her back. </p><p>“That’s too much-” she tried to say, but her complaint died early —replaced by another moan— when I grabbed her hair and painfully forced her to stand up, and pushed her against on top of a crate. </p><p>“Are you sure?” I asked even as I pushed her skirt up, revealing her great ass and wide panties. Unlike the rest of her clothes, she didn’t need her panties to walk across the room, so I ripped them off mercilessly, stuffing them into her mouth instead, despite her indignant huff. Somehow, I once again managed to trigger her. Pity that it was too late. </p><p>Still, as she bent over the crate, she was obedient, and gushing uncontrollably. Her emotions were clearly out of control, unable to understand how some light flirting was about to turn into merciless fucking. “You need better underwear,” I mentioned absentmindedly even as I watched her shiver against the cold surface of the crate —the pantry was rather cold. </p><p>When I slapped her ass hard, she just moaned, proving that she had already accepted the new balance of our temporary relationship. “Excellent,” I murmured as I pushed inside her wet snatch, enjoying her tightness, even as I spanked her quivering ass once more. It was just too deliciously curvy to ignore.  </p><p>Despite her improvised gag, her cries were loud enough to make me glad for the thick walls of the pantry, though the echoes of my spanks on her bare ass were no less loud. And from the way she tightened with each slap, I was sure that she was enjoying the treatment immensely.</p><p>I picked up the pace, slamming harder and harder inside her, while I took pity on her, and started massaging her tender ass between spanks. </p><p>When I reached and pulled her panties out of her mouth, she was too far gone to do anything other than moaning incessantly. “What a tight pussy,” I murmured in fascination even as I slammed inside her again and again. “Your husband is not using it properly?” </p><p>“He went for a hunting trip,” she somehow managed to answer between her moans. “And we just married.” </p><p>“Does he know what a big slut his wife is?” I asked even as I slapped her ass once more, but this time with a small twist. I cast the spell to clean and lubricate her backdoor, then slipped three fingers immediately, forcing her to cry loudly with unexpected pain. </p><p>“Not here!” she managed to exclaim, but these were the only words she managed to utter as my fingers mercilessly invaded her tight hole, loosening it for the next move. </p><p>“Not a chance sweetie, not if you don’t want me to stop, of course.” I chuckled when I pulled out and pressed against her puckered hole, only to meet with a pointed silence. “Just as I guessed,” I said even as I slammed inside her, enjoying her cries. She widened her legs to make it easier to take it, which was a rather hopeless task as I pushed mercilessly. She should be glad that I was decent in healing magic, because otherwise, I doubted that she could walk. </p><p>“Damn, slut. This is your first time there, right. Your ass is far too tight to be anything else. God, it feels like you're going to take the skin right off my cock,\" I moaned as I pumped mercilessly. </p><p>She didn’t cry, because she was far too gone to actually cry. She just breathed heavily, trying to contain the pleasure she was feeling without passing out. A whimper escaped when I grabbed her hair and pulled hard, just enough to lift her tits from the surface and started mauling them once more. </p><p>Despite the pleasure, I frowned, because I felt the trap on the door getting triggered. “Horrible timing,” I murmured unhappily, taking a note to be extra rough in the interrogation. Luckily the trap was strong enough to keep him in place for a minute at least. </p><p>I slammed into Elva with reckless abandon, her voluptuous body juggling beautifully with each beat. Already on the edge, that was enough for her to climax, and her sudden tightening triggered mine, and I filled her bowels with my seed. When I pulled out, she was moaning deliriously. “Good work, sweetie,” I said even as I cast a healing spell, pushing her even deeper into delirium, and pulled a gold coin from my pocket and put it next to her. She somehow managed to send an angry glare at me, annoyed at me treating her like an actual whore. </p><p>“Take it as compensation for your ruined clothes,” I said as I slapped her ass one last time. “And you better fix yourself before someone comes down and sees the depths of your sluttiness.” </p><p>With that, I turned and left toward the door, where I had just caught myself a proper target for interrogation.  </p>",

    "content": "<p>I wasn’t expecting much when I walked downstairs to the main hall of the trading outpost we were currently in, but what I had found managed to disappoint even those meager expectations. Rough furniture was haphazardly thrown around, each damaged enough to suggest that bar fights were a common pastime. The thick layer of smoke that filled the room not exactly helped to enhance the mood of the room. </p><p>I let my gaze drag lazily around the room, noticing some curious eyes that were far too interested in my looks. One of them, a large man with several tribal tattoos covering his arms and half of his face, had a great dose of anger in his face. I didn’t even bother to keep eye contact with her, instead of meeting with the eyes of the waitress that was standing behind the bar. </p><p>“May I have a tankard of ale and some food, sweetheart,” I said, letting my gaze dip down, devouring the sight of her body. She was wearing a tight bodice with a generous cleavage, and while her skirt was long enough to cover her knees, it was also tight enough to hint at the beauty of her toned legs. Combined with her honey-blonde hair, her shining blue eyes, and deliciously plump body, she was a tasty sample. </p><p>Of course, I didn’t take it as an example of my charm when she giggled playfully before started filling my tankard. Her beauty was clearly a part of the service here, and considering she was still happy and cheerful, the trading post had enough muscle to dissuade anyone that felt like being too enthusiastic with their attention. </p><p>I noticed her expression suddenly stiffening before I heard the stomping footsteps closing in. I shifted in my chair to look the other way, but I didn’t stand up, not even when the tattooed big guy stood in front of me, doing his best to look menacing as he grabbed his dagger, three other men just a step behind him. I looked at him lazily, my smirk just wide enough to stroke his anger further. </p><p>“So, you’re finally awake,” he said with a gruff voice. </p><p>“I know you, how?” I answered, followed by an amused chuckle. I wasn’t afraid of them, simply because they were standing too close together. All I needed was to push the big guy back, and all four would be tangled together at least for a moment, which would be a deadly mistake in any kind of battle. </p><p>“You owe me a nice beating because of the bitches that was carrying you like a pathetic carcass,” he said gruffly as he leaned forward, our faces separated by inches. “I didn’t hurt them because they were women, and they have better uses, but for you, I have more interesting plans.” </p><p>People at the bar were watching us in lazy amusement until the tattooed man pulled his dagger. Silence ruled the room for a moment, suggesting that while barfights were common here, real combat was much rarer. </p><p>Still, I couldn’t help but frown as I blocked his arm before his swing could pick up speed. My assailant had reached his dagger too quickly. Something wasn’t right. </p><p>So, I made sure to keep an eye on my surroundings even as I pushed him back, forcing him to tangle with his friends. “Feeling a bit cowardly, big guy?” I stated rather than following up, even as I spread a thin layer of magic from my body, as little as I could manage, to establish a connection with the runic protection scheme I left back in my room. It was clearly a distraction, and there was only one reason to distract me. </p><p>My instincts turned out to be right, because it wasn’t only my own magic that I could feel from the protective wards. Foreign magic was trying to penetrate the outer layer, quite skillfully I might add. Unfortunately for my mystery assailant, even before my Ascension, my runic wards were unrivaled. Now that they were backed up with the boundless powers of a Sorcerer, it was impossible for them to penetrate it in just a moment. </p><p>Secure in the knowledge that my room was protected, I punched one of the goons before dodging the punch of another one, intentionally stretching the encounter. It was becoming clear that whoever wanted to enter my room had either bribed or manipulated the four idiots that were attacking me. And considering they hadn’t tried anything when I was in the room, they had to know I was the dangerous one, something a casual observer wouldn’t know since I was unconscious when we first arrived at the trading post. </p><p>My mysterious opponent struck again, I reasoned. I didn’t push to finish the combat immediately, because I wanted to present them with a better target, forcing them to spend their cards. The more I revealed about my opponents, the better. “Come on, big guy, you can do better,” I called even as I grabbed the wrist of one of the goons, and with a practiced twist, forced his arm off its shoulder-socket. </p><p>The goon let out a cry loud enough to make my ears ring, while the other three dashed toward me, trying to drown me in numbers. However, as I ducked and weaved through the punches, I noticed a small man, wearing furs and carrying a bow, moved closer to the fight with a practiced intent. I expected him to put that bow to use, or join the battle with a dagger, trying to ambush me. </p><p>Which was why I was rather surprised when he used the distraction of the barmaid to reach over my drink and flick his ring. A few drops of clear liquid easily slipped into my drink without anyone else —except me— realizing it. </p><p>I felt myself chill. Not because of the possibility of being poisoned, but by the rather impressive skill my prospective assassin had displayed. And not just the skills itself, but the effort it would have taken to communicate with an Assassin and direct him to a trading post in the middle of nowhere. We had been in this trading post just for a few days, and the fact that they were able to arrange such a thing proved their information-gathering capabilities as well as their reach. </p><p>Despite the realization, however, I continued to fight in a flashy manner, not alerting my professional observers that I had long noticed their ploy. “How does it feel to be the punching bag,” I shouted loudly as I punched my tattooed assailant once more, and he collapsed. </p><p>Before he could stand up, the guards arrived and grabbed him, as well as his three friends. One of the guards turned toward me, probably to subject me to the same treatment, but he stopped when the barmaid waved her hand. </p><p>“It’s nice to exercise before eating,” I said after I took my seat at the bar, smiling at the blonde barmaid. </p><p>She giggled. “It was a good show, but it’s good to see you moving around. When your friends brought you here, you were no different than dead.” </p><p>I shrugged. “I’m a good fighter, but sometimes, I miscalculate,” I explained as I touched my temple, implying that my unconsciousness was about a physical injury, likely a concussion. From the corner of my eye, I could see the hunter that poisoned my drink watching me carefully. After the fight, he wasn’t the only one that was watching me, but he was the only one that was watching me with an icy gaze. </p><p>I brought the tankard to my lips, taking a fake-sip while I dragged my finger on the bottom of the tankard. I put it down the moment the rune was completed, helping me to channel my magic into the tankard without being obvious. The subtle glow was a bit annoying, but I put the tankard back on the bar before it started glowing, hiding it from the view. </p><p>“Even the best have their off-days, I suppose,” she said flirtatiously, complete with a wink. “Luckily, today is not one of them.” </p><p>“I suppose not,” I answered even as I slowly filled the tankard with my magic, using it to separate the poison from the drink, and collecting it on the bottom. Only after the poison was secured and the drink was safe, I took a long sip, tricking my would-be-assassin that his ploy was successful. </p><p>Even as I savored the bitter taste of the ale, I continued analyzing the poison. Except for the rare conditions, it was hard to identify poisons easily. Even if one was familiar with the exact poison that had been used, several different spells were required to make sure the identification was correct. </p><p>Hence, I was surprised when I was able to recognize it easily. </p><p>It was the Nectar of Pluto! </p><p>It took everything I had to suppress my panic, not because of the potential effects of the poison —though they were rather scary— but the implications it carried. </p><p>Nectar of Pluto was a special poison designed to deal with particularly troublesome mages without mobilizing a large team. It was effective, because once ingested, it directly attached itself to the target’s magic, completely spreading into it in a few minutes, before it started to erode it. I doubted that it would be effective against me after my Ascension —a Sorcerer’s magic wasn’t easy to manipulate— but before that, I wouldn’t survive. I know that, because my grandfather had poisoned me with it before I left for school in another crazy lesson of his. </p><p>However, the real problem was the source of it. Nectar of Neptune was a substance that was strictly controlled by the Temple of Pluto, and it was only used after a high-level approval. Someone on the at least governor or senator level needed to approve it personally to requisition it for their needs. Even for them, a couple of dosages every year was the limit. </p><p>Excellent, I thought panickedly, though I kept my gaze straight. My enemies were willing to waste some very precious resources to deal with me —or worse, they had an abundance of a restricted substance like Nectar of Pluto, which was even worse than the alternative. </p><p>I needed to act, I decided. Luckily, my excuse to act was standing in front of me, watching me with shining blue eyes. “So,” I whispered playfully even as I turned my best smile toward the barmaid. “Is there compensation for proper display of heroics?” I asked. </p><p>“You’re very forward,” she whispered back, but smiling nonetheless. “Aren’t your lady friends enough to fulfill your beastly desires?” </p><p>“Evidenced by the fact that they are sleeping in my room, exhausted, while I’m trying to find a nice way to spend my time, evidently not,” I answered back.</p><p>“Bullshit,” she whispered back, but she still giggled. “There’s no way you can put these two down and still look for more. Are you sure it was you that exhausted them, and they didn’t fell asleep from boredom?” </p><p>“It sounds like a challenge,” I said even as I let the presence of my magic blanket her tight, the slight pressure enhancing her arousal further —not that I needed to work too hard, she was fighting with her own arousal since she had watched me methodically beat down four men with nothing more than my fists. The trick with my magical aura was just overkill. </p><p>She pulled back like nothing had been said, but made a point of winking at me. It was a subtle thing, one that avoided the attention of most of the crowd, but not the assassin that was watching us with a sharp gaze. Luckily, I didn’t care about it. </p><p>Instead, I watched the sexy barmaid run around, making a show of business, while I made a show of finishing two-thirds of the tankard, convincing my assassin that I had been properly poisoned, and all he needed was to wait for a few minutes for his success. </p><p>Upstairs, someone else was still trying to break through my wards methodically, but with very little success. </p><p>“Harold, we’re out of spices, I’m going to the basement to get a new batch,” the barmaid explained to the sleepy guard that was standing next to the bar. The guard nodded after looking at the empty urn, but he missed earlier when the barmaid had dipped the same urn into the garbage, getting rid of the extra. </p><p>“Do you need any help reaching it, Elva?” said the guard, but his bored tone suggested that it was the last thing he wanted. His loss, my gain. </p><p>“No, after the fight, we have a mess. It’s for the best if you stay here,” the barmaid —whose name was Elva, as I just learned— while walked out and took the stairs toward the lower level. I waited a minute, just enough to make it less suspicious for the rest of the patrons while also convincing my assassin that I was looking for a quick lay, I continued, still carrying my tankard with me. </p><p>It might be a ploy, but I was excited about what awaited me downstairs. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Three hours after my talk with Natalie, I left the room, leaving a satisfied but exhausted Jenny behind, sleeping softly. I hadn’t sent the recording to Natalie, of course. Instead, I saved it to a secure server and deleted it from my phone. We could always watch it together, but I had no intention of giving Natalie something she could leverage against me, and an explicit recording of me having sex was definitely something in that vein. </p><p>I wasn’t afraid of Natalie anymore, but that didn’t mean I would ignore the basic logic. Yes, she didn’t lack the opportunities to get a hidden recording of her own, but it was very different than one recorded by myself and shared with me. That actually turned it into admissible evidence in all kinds of internal company procedures. </p><p>I could have stayed in my room and asked for room service, but watching TV while Jenny slept until the morning didn’t sound like an attractive option —and she would after our exhausting lovemaking session. We had spent enough time together for me to learn her habits. </p><p>With that in mind, I decided to try one of the restaurants in the resort, famous for its excellent steaks and extensive selection of bourbon. I was passing through the lobby when I heard a familiar, yet unwelcome voice. “Hey, boss, good evening,” called Mike, his smarmy voice grating my nerves. </p><p>Even then, when I turned, a large smile was on my lips, mostly aimed for the partner that I expected to see next to him. “Hi, Mike, ready for an amazing retreat?” I said even as my eyes met with his wife Tiffany’s, her lips curled in a knowing smile. </p><p>The smile on her face was beautiful, though not beautiful as her body, peeking through the loose summer dress that was short enough to reveal most of her curvy legs. The dress was more conservative on the topside, but it was only assuming a normal-sized chest. Tiffany’s beautiful curves had ruined the plans of the fashion designer, giving me an excellent glimpse of her amazing breasts. </p><p>“Of course, I have excellent plans for our latest product,” Mike said enthusiastically, and I couldn’t help but respond with a smile. Personally, I didn’t like Mike, not because of his lack of ethics and his willingness to use underhanded means, as I wasn’t too far from that path. I didn’t build my own company from nothing by being nice. However, his fake cheer and his unashamed brown-nosing managed to kill any respect his willingness to succeed might generate. A man needed gravitas. </p><p>Of course, it didn’t mean that I was unhappy promoting him. When I expanded his responsibilities —after his wife’s very convincing arguments while he was drunk and sleeping across us in his own dining room, followed by another long session in their wedding bed— I had made sure to put several dead territories to his expanded area, but somehow, he managed to revitalize them. </p><p>That hadn’t been a simple job, of course. It was only possible through endless overtimes and extended business trips —not to mention some unexplained spending on the discretionary budget which I subtly ignored but recorded just in case. Gifts and other bribery were a way of doing business, but also it created a true disaster if caught, so I made sure both I and Natalie were isolated from its impact if caught. </p><p>“And how is your beautiful wife,” I asked after two minutes of listening to him droning about a new incentive system. </p><p>“She is a bit unhappy about overtimes, but doing well enough,” he answered, feeling no problem answering for her even as he subtly pushed her forward. I grabbed her hand and kissed her knuckles gently while Mike smiled in a smug manner. </p><p>The smile I shared with Tiffany was more concealed, but even more amused. Mike was convinced that I had a crush on his wife —which wasn’t entirely incorrect— and secretly encouraged his wife about feeding that crush so that he could use that attraction to get more benefit from me. I knew that discussion, because Tiffany shared it with me during one of our idle chats while laying in their bed, trying to catch our breath for another session. </p><p>Mike might have some ideas about Tiffany flirting with me, something his wife agreed without reservation. Of course, he didn’t know that like a dutiful boss, I was helping to minimize the impact of the lonely nights Tiffany was suffering as Mike went to his frequent business trips, usually while she models another fancy lingerie she purchased from her husband’s newly expanded salary. </p><p>“How are you this evening, milady?” I asked, and she giggled exaggeratedly, dipping just enough to enhance the view of her cleavage. I made sure to stretch my gaze. Mike noticed it, rolling his eyes in a manner he thought to be secret. </p><p>“Charlie, come and meet the boss,” Mike said after I let go of Tiffany’s hand, but stayed close enough to get a few glimpses into her cleavage —not that I was desperate, but I wanted to ma. A young man in his early twenties who had been watching us came closer, and a vaguely-Asian looking beautiful woman followed him. “This is our new star in the southern district, and a true genius of material sciences that could answer any question our clients can come up with,” Mike explained.</p><p>Since Mike was obviously proud of him, I carefully examined Charlie even as we talked for a minute. He was wearing a well-fitting suit that hid a thin frame underneath, but it was unable to hide his slouched posture. Combined with his fearful expression as he struggled to meet my eyes, it wasn’t hard to guess he was one of those technical experts with little self-confidence. A perfect choice to support Mike’s expansion strategy, smart enough to support him, but too weak on the aspect of selling to be a real threat. His manner of speaking just confirmed it. </p><p>“So, enough about work,” I said. “Who is the beauty next to you?”</p><p>“U-Umi,” he stammered, shocked by my sudden shift. I could see a tendril of anger appearing in his eyes, but it disappeared just as quickly as it appeared. He disliked my attention, but lacked the courage to stand against the boss. “She’s my fiance.” </p><p>“Nice to meet you, Umi,” I said even as I grabbed the hand she presented, but once again, rather than shaking it, I elected to leave a lingering kiss on her knuckles. Moreover, I used the opportunity to carefully examine her looks. Her half-Asian roots were rather obvious with her black hair, dainty face, and the shape of her dark eyes, and her name just confirmed her Japanese roots. </p><p>“A p-pleasure,” she answered, but stammered badly as she said so, signaling that she was even shyer than her husband. She lacked an accent, suggesting she grew up in America rather than Japan. </p><p>“It’s definitely a pleasure,” I said even as I let my gaze down, examining her rather impressive chest. Apparently, no one had told her breasts about being Asian, because they were amazingly large, threatening to spill through her conservative blouse, making her look sexy despite her boring top, and even more boring knee-high skirt. </p><p>I let my gaze linger on her breasts, more as a test to the newly established couple —though it would be a lie if I said I didn’t enjoy the sight. They failed the test rather badly, because Charlie only managed to stammer weakly. “Sir, we need to go visit the reception,” he murmured in the end as he grabbed his fiancee’s hand, dragging her along. </p><p>“Nice kid,” I said to Mike, who was smirking at Charlie’s reaction, though his mocking gaze slipped at me, no doubt feeling superior about how a pair of tits was enough to confuse his poor old boss. I doubted his smile would be as patronizing if he had any idea about the extent to which my flirting with his wife had progressed. “A bit serious, though.” </p><p>“Don’t worry, he’s learning,” he said before turning to his wife. “Honey, I will go get our rooms, but you don’t need to tire yourself. Why don’t you accompany Nathan for a drink,” he said, sharing an amused wink with his wife, one that Tiffany shared with a smile, amused by the unknowing approval she had received from her husband. </p><p>“Sure, honey,” she said, then took a step back to avoid his attempt to kiss, while managing to look it completely accidental. From Mike’s lack of anger, I guessed that it was rehearsed. Tiffany put her hand on my arm, and we started walking. </p><p>Tiffany said nothing until Mike went to rejoin Charlie and his fiancee. “So, drinks in the bar, or in private where we could continue working on my little pregnancy problem,” Tiffany whispered as we started walking. </p><p>“Who said we can’t work on your little issue while we are still at the bar,” I whispered, making her eyes widen in shock and appreciation. However, before she could answer, I made a stop and leaned against the wall, close enough to the reception to hear what Mike and Charlie were speaking while still staying away from their gaze. </p><p>“Should I be jealous,” Tiffany whispered even as she pressed her body against mine suggestively, but her tone lacked the heat, instead sounded curious. </p><p>“Well, I was thinking about spicing our little dinner with some Asian delicacies, but if you want to stay kosher…” I murmured. </p><p>“You can’t be serious,” she whispered back, careful not to be heard. “Little miss I won’t even let my fiancee see me naked before marriage. Impossible. She won’t even sit together with you.” </p><p>“Oh, you should have more trust in your husband,” I said. </p><p>She looked at me questioningly. “Did you already talked with him about it before we arrived here?” she asked, curious. </p><p>“Oh, no. But you’re underestimating your husband’s lack of spine and brownnosing instincts if you think I actually need to say something to convince her to act. Listen.” </p><p>She took my clue, and we started to listen. For a couple of minutes, we listened to a boring conversation about lead assignments and conversion rates, before Charlie finally breached the topic. “So…” he murmured, trailing for a while. “The big boss was… interesting… Is your wife a friend of him?” </p><p>“He’s one of the old guard that actually believes that he’s suave and charming, but he’s completely harmless,” Mike answered, and I actually had to kiss Tiffany to suppress her laughter. Mike really had an overinflated sense of his own superiority, if he wasn’t even suspecting after all those months. </p><p>“Is he?” Charlie answered, his tone doubtful. “He seemed…” he continued, suggesting that his common sense was considerably better than Mike’s. </p><p>“Don’t worry about it, it’s all for show. He’s old enough to have trouble getting up without drugs. He’s just posturing to save his ego.” I shook my head in amusement. Insults about age and impotence lost its effectiveness when one was railing at the attacker’s wife at least once a week… </p><p>“Still-” Umi said, trying to interject into the conversation. </p><p>“Look,” Mike cut in. “It’s your call, but he’s the one that’s going to sign on the final commission and territory assignments. If my wife sharing a drink and giggling suggestively once every three months doubles my income, I’m not going to say no. You should start thinking about it as well?” </p><p>“What are you saying!” Charlie asked, his tone even louder. </p><p>“I’m saying that I still remember you talking half an hour about your dream house, and how you two can’t afford the down-payment. I’m also saying that if your fiancee happened to visit the bar wearing a beautiful dress while we are out having a boy’s night, your year-end bonus might be thick enough for you to actually afford that.” </p><p>Charlie’s wife interjected. “But that’s horrible!” </p><p>“It’s your call, Umi,” Mike said with a little laugh. “If you find the idea of sharing a drink in a bar that reprehensible, you guys could live in an apartment rather than a beautiful house.” </p><p>I looked at Tiffany, who was struggling to keep her laughter, her red hair shaking with her every trembling breath. Mike was a good salesperson, I had to admit. A bit unobservant when it came to his own home, but nobody was perfect. </p><p>“I don’t know…” Charlie murmured. “Can you ask your wife to take care of Umi if she goes there?” </p><p>Umi gasped. “You can’t be serious!” </p><p>“Well…” Charlie murmured. I couldn’t see him, but I could see him shaking with indecision and fear, but unable to reject Mike’s sensible words. “It’s not exactly bad, if you think about it. Tiffany would be there to help you navigate the situation, and run screening if he ever tries to be pushy.” </p><p>“Don’t worry, that’s not a problem,” Mike cut in. “Tiffany guarantees that he’s a gentleman.” </p><p>Of course, I was. I always made sure that Tiffany had multiple orgasms during our meetings, even the ones we were rather stuck in time. I chuckled silently and gestured Tiffany to move before they sent Umi ahead to prepare. “You were right,” Tiffany murmured, fascinated. “I was really underestimating my dear husband’s brown-nosing abilities.” </p><p>“Right,” I said with a chuckle. “Let’s go and find ourselves a booth. It seems that we have a guest to entertain.” </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Somebody is impatient,” I said even as I looked up to catch her beautiful blue eyes, enjoying the impatience and arousal dancing behind them. Marianne was normally so passive, but apparently, watching —relatively— passively as Cornelia got fucked into exhaustion managed to break her endless patience. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 19%]</p><p>“You made me wait too much,” she answered with a moan even as she started jumping up and down on my lap, her tits dangling sexily. “That was rude, you come here and make me excited, only to spend all your time with Cornelia.” </p><p>“Sorry,” I said, but my smirk showing my insincerity, which earned a playful slap even as she continued to ride me without missing a beat. “But we had been working hard with her to solve her leveling problem, and now that I have solved it, she deserved a bit of celebration, doesn’t she?” </p><p>This time, Marianne’s determined ride stopped, her expression twisted in shock. “You solved her leveling problem?” she gasped. “Impossible!” </p><p>“Is it, though?” I answered even as I used the opportunity to switch positions, with her lying under me, but instead of taking a mild missionary position, I put her legs to my shoulder, locking her in a sexy prison. As I impaled her as deep as I could manage, she gasped loudly. Delicious, I decided. </p><p>“It was supposed to-” she started, only to be interrupted by her own moan as my shaft filled her completely. “It was supposed to be impossible,” she completed. “That’s what everyone says. It’ll make you a hero!” she said excitedly. </p><p>“No!” I warned in a dark tone. “That’s going to stay a secret, unless you want all of us to suddenly get locked in a cell and get experimented again and again.” To be fair, with my power and my ability to elevate others, I wasn’t entirely sure that would be my fate. They might decide not to risk it and decide to cooperate with me instead, but even that best case was not a good option for me. I was doing pretty well without any oversight, and I had no intention of changing it. </p><p>“I understand,” Marianne gasped fearfully, and I could see the realization in her eyes. She stiffened with fear, and I realized I might have overdone with the intimidation. </p><p>“Good girl,” I answered even as I leaned down to capture her lips in a searing kiss, one that I stretched until her stiffness disappeared, once again moaning as I slammed repeatedly inside her. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 21%]</p><p>For a moment, silence ruled the room —discounting the clap of our bodies slamming together, my grunts, and her moans— while I appreciated the rapid increase of the companion process. With that, I remembered that I was yet to examine her soul space, and sent a tendril inside. </p><p>The results of my findings didn’t surprise me. Like my other magically-inclined partners, her physical stats were simply abysmal while mental ones were at least workable. Only her wisdom was a step above the rest, and even that was below twenty. Like the others, she had one primary skill, one I easily recognized as a more specialized version of my biomancy —likely healing— so I started examining it more carefully. It was at Grandmaster level, I recognized, but unlike the others, it was yet to fully mature, probably requiring one or two levels before it completed its evolution and she was free to select another skill. </p><p>However, I received another surprise as I examined her skill in detail. </p><p>[+13 Biomancy]</p><p>The sudden jump was completely unexpected, and it occurred when our skills touched for a moment. Even more surprisingly, I could feel her skill evolving as well, though not to the same extent. “Why did I just gain three points of healing?” she asked, shocked. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 24%]</p><p>“A little gift for you,” I answered even as I impaled her even deeper. “Did you assume that Cornelia was going to be the only one that gets some benefits?” I asked. She didn’t answer, but the astonished expression on her face was answer enough. I shrugged. Since she had already received an important clue, there was no harm pushing it even more. </p><p>“What would you do if I tell you I have another gift in mind?” I asked, and her expression turned into shock and elation. It was understandable, as not everyone shared my ridiculous growth potential. Just gaining a few extra points to a high-level skill was not something she expected to happen in one day, and here I was, offering her even more. </p><p>“Whatever you want!” she exclaimed without even thinking, something I had all the intention of taking seriously. Luckily for her, my objectives didn’t run contrary to hers. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said as I leaned for a kiss while I continued to slam, until the companion process clicked again. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 25% - First Stage Completed +5000 Exp]</p><p>Level UP!</p><p>[Select one of the following skills: Grandmaster Biomancy (Requires 5 Points), Master Arcana, Master Elemental] </p><p>“An achievement!” Marianne stammered in shock, unable to believe what had just happened. While she enjoyed her fascination, I turned my attention to my skill selection, and after brief consideration, chose Elemental, despite the temptation of selecting Biomancy. An even stronger life-based ability would have been useful against the necromancers, but I wasn’t willing to make the commitment for the next five levels. </p><p>Ultimately, my versatility was the reason for my great success, and I had no reason to change that after the incredible boosts I had received to my skills, allowing me to progress more on my path without making big sacrifices. </p><p>Marianne sat on the edge of the bed, and I sat next to her, close enough for our shoulders to touch. She put her head on my shoulder, and murmured. “How?” </p><p>“It’s a secret ability of mine,” I told her, though I didn’t give more detail. After she had already received her first achievement, that part wasn’t exactly a secret, after all. However, I didn’t explain more, as I still needed to make sure I could trust her. “It’s just the tip of the iceberg,” I explained. “You’ll receive more benefits as we continue,” she explained. </p><p>“Why me? Why Cornelia?” she asked. “Is it because of our families?” she added, this time her voice trembling just a bit, like she was afraid she was just a tool to be discarded. </p><p>“No, on the contrary, your noble identities make things unnecessarily complicated for me,” I answered, which had the benefit of being completely true. Of course, the real answer was because of luck, then my stubbornness, but I doubt she would have liked to hear that particular answer.</p><p>“Then, why?” she asked. </p><p>“Because you are beautiful, kind, and very very sexy,” I answered as I gently grabbed her chin and stole a tender, lingering kiss, one that eroded her fears immediately. Charisma was such a useful trait. “Not to mention you’re very skilled in your area, meaning with my assistance, you have the potential to become an overwhelming powerhouse.” </p><p>“Really? That’s it?” she asked, her smile blossoming. Apparently, the fact that I chose her for her beauty and skills rather than her family name was a great relief to her. Then, she frowned a bit. “But I’m just a healer, nothing impressive like Cornelia. She’s majestic, and with the potential to gain levels once more, she’ll just become even more magnificent. What if you get bored with me.” </p><p>I couldn’t help but chuckle. Even before I had gained a deeper understanding of their relationship, it was clear that Marianne had a star-struck attitude toward Cornelia, so her fears of being left behind where another woman might feel jealous were very much understandable. </p><p>“First of all, a healer is definitely not worthless, no matter the situation,” I stated, which was completely correct. A healer was always a strategic asset that increased the combat effectiveness of any group by several orders of magnitude. I could heal, of course, but due to my generalist skill, not as effectively —my stats and my huge mana pool compensated for that, but I had many roles in a combat situation, so a proper healer was always welcome. </p><p>Then, I briefly considered the biggest challenge I was facing, and decided to test her. “Secondly, you don’t have to be only a healer,” I said even as I raised my hand, gathering a glowing ball of life energy, the same one I was using to fight against the undead with incredible efficiency. </p><p>[-2 Mana]</p><p>“What’s this,” Marianne murmured, fascinated as she poked her finger, enjoying the sensation. </p><p>“It’s a variant of healing spell that I had been using against the undead with incredible efficiency,” I explained. “If you can learn that, you’ll be several times more efficient against the undead. </p><p>“Really?” she asked, her enthusiasm shining. “But I can’t take a new skill for the next two levels, and even then, who knows when I’ll have the opportunity to select the correct one,” she added, her enthusiasm wilting instantly. </p><p>“Doesn’t matter, I don’t want you to learn a new skill, I want you to figure out how to replicate this by leveraging your healing abilities, it’s not that different.” </p><p>“But that’s impossible…” she started, only to drift out. “It’s not impossible, is it?” she said. I smiled positively, and she beamed before raising her hand, and her mana rose, trying to replicate it. </p><p>It wasn’t a simple thing to even with an example in front of her. But she didn’t feel discouraged as she spent the next half an hour trying to work that out, only to get the slightest success even with all my recommendations. I was glad that I still had the temporary skill I gained from Helga active, allowing me to make theoretical leaps that would have been otherwise impossible even with my abilities. </p><p>In the end, when her mana pool was emptied, we only have a fleeting success, something that wouldn’t hurt even the weakest skeleton. “Sorry,” she murmured. “I failed.” </p><p>Unlike her, I was smiling widely. I kissed her to cheer her. “Don’t worry about it, it’s not something you can succeed in a session, and from what I saw, I can confidently state success is possible. You just need to work more,” I said. </p><p>“I won’t disappoint you,” she said resolutely, and I rewarded her with another kiss, hugging her comfortingly. </p><p>“I know you won’t. Just continue working on it tomorrow,” I answered. I could have injected more mana into her and make her continue practicing, but we have stopped enough. I grabbed her corset, and ripping it off with one simple pull, earning a shocked yet excited cry for her. “We can return to our fun, then,” I said. </p><p>“Y-” she tried to start, only for her to get silenced by another kiss, this time with a lot of tongue. I let my hands dance over her body while she managed to take a seat on my lap, once again engulfing my shaft with her warmth. To make things more exciting, I stood up and started walking around the room, cutting her feet off the ground, impaling her deep with every step. </p><p>She moaned loudly with each step, enjoying her joyride as I patrolled the bedroom repeatedly.  </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 29%]</p><p>“Fill me up,” she moaned. I want to feel your warmth inside me, spoiling me, covering me…” she repeated dazedly. Who was I to disappoint the wishes of such a beautiful lady? </p><p>I moved to the closest wall and pressed until her back was straight against its cold surface, allowing me to cut loose mercilessly as I slammed inside her repeatedly. Her fat breasts pressed against my chest, wobbling with each beat like they were waves threatening to drown me. It was nothing, however, compared to her hungry kiss, trying to devour my lips, once again confirming the fact that it was the quiet ones you needed to watch out for. </p><p>However, realizing that there was still a bit until I cum, I decided to pull another trick on her, one that as a healer, she would easily understand the difficulty. I pulled out even as I flared my mana, and when I put my hand on my shaft, it grew three more inches and thickened considerably. </p><p>[-246 Mana]</p><p>[+4 Biomancy]</p><p>It was a costly spell that took a lot of expertise, but for me, it was as easy as breathing —partially thanks to my magical theory skill still active, allowing me to draw correct lessons and insights from the earlier practice attempts. </p><p>The results were worth it. Her eyes grew in shock. “How,” she murmured fascinatingly, but it was immediately replaced with fear as I pressed it against her entrance, threatening to tear her apart. “I can’t take it!” she gasped, but that didn’t prevent her from moaning as I slowly but steadily pushed her inside her, enjoying a whole new level of tightness. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 36%]</p><p>The sudden jump in the companion process, however, showed her rather impressive appreciation. I pushed even deeper, and she moaned, helpless but in ecstasy, her earlier fears discarded under the new sensation. She started trembling, signaling an instant climax. </p><p>I knew that she was very appreciative of my already-impressive size, but the fact that she turned out to be a true size queen was a surprise. A pleasant surprise that I was willing to use to the limit, though I made sure to maintain an active observation with my healing just in case. </p><p>I pushed, and she moaned deliciously, moving steadily toward another orgasm before the aftershocks of the first one had subsumed. And since I was actively maintaining a Biomancy observation, I decided to apply another trick, and prepared her back entrance for an intrusion. </p><p>The way her eyes widened in shock and arousal as I pressed my engorged shaft against her puckered hole was beautiful. “Im-impossible,” she muttered, but the crown was already in her puckered hole when she uttered the last syllable, too busy crying in pain and pleasure. I slammed deep, pumped a couple of times, then pulled out and repeated the action on her proper entrance. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 42%]</p><p>She was like a precious toy under my control, helpless to resist my perverse merciless assault. Of course, her face, contorted with a thick pleasure, provided an alternative narrative to that dark tale. </p><p>She was mine, I decided. Just like Helga, Marianne was mine, and I had no intention of letting her go. </p><p>“Tell me who you are,” I asked. </p><p>“I’m your slut,” she slurred, pleasure threatening to drown her completely. “You own me as long as you fuck me like this,” she added, once again managing to surprise me with her transformation. </p><p>“Good girl,” I said even as exploded inside her, filling her to the brim. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 46%]</p><p>She looked like she was about to fall unconscious, which was not acceptable, not when we were about to complete the second stage of the companion process. A simple healing spell prevented me from going soft, while another spell provided her with a jolt of energy, enough to keep her from falling unconscious. </p><p>“Ready for another round,” I said even as I wrapped my arms around her waist and started walking once more, this time directly to the bed, and I laid her on top of Cornelia. Marianne twisted until she was on all fours, her knees and hands on both sides of Cornelia while her tits dangled just inches above Cornelia’s. </p><p>Another delicious view, I thought for a second even as I plunged into Marianne’s tight hole, enjoying the way her moans echoed, but Cornelia was too exhausted to actually wake up, even when my seed and Marianne’s juices spilled over her body, covering her legs and stomach. </p><p>Enjoying the enhanced tightness of her body, this time, it didn’t take long for me to near another climax. Before I exploded, however, Marianne’s progress finally reached the critical point, and triggered a welcome notification. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 50% - Second Stage Completed +10000 Exp]</p><p>[Mana regeneration perk activated. Count 3. Duration, 8 hours]</p><p>Another load was a good reward for her diligence, I decided, even as she slurred with joy, trying to celebrate her second achievement, but too far gone to mutter a coherent word. I impaled my shaft into her tight hole and exploded, filling a second hole with my seed. </p><p>This time, when she fell on top of Cornelia, exhausted, I let her be after pulling the cover on her, leaving them wrapped in a dirty hug. They both had enough excitement for the night and deserved their rest. </p><p>I also gained some incredible benefits. Levels were always welcome, and I managed to bring possible mana regeneration perks to four, and from the current speed of regeneration, I assumed that my mana pool would be regenerated fully every fifteen minutes when all instances were active. </p><p>Meaning, I could the girls allow over fifteen thousand experience points every hour. Once I decided it was safe enough to reveal that secret, the leveling process of the girls would get a lot faster… </p><p>And a lot more fun, together… </p><p>————</p><p>[Level: 23    Experience: 263100 / 276000 </p><p>Strength: 28    Charisma: 38</p><p>Precision: 21    Perception: 25</p><p>Agility: 25     Manipulation: 30</p><p>Speed: 23       Intelligence: 30</p><p>Endurance: 22      Wisdom: 32</p><p>HP: 2737 / 2737\tMana: 3265 / 3565        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [92/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [75/100]</p><p>Expert Arcana [75/75]        </p><p>Advanced Subterfuge [50/50]         </p><p>Basic Speech [25/25]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p>",

    "content": "<p>Marianne was silent as she slid into the right side of the bed, her gaze bouncing between me and Cornelia, no doubt trying to understand the sudden change. Her surprise was understandable, as during our last encounter, things were rather heated, to a point that she actually cast spells indoors, triggering a battle, only to stop when I tricked her to believe that I was overwhelmingly strong. </p><p>At that point, I was several levels lower than her, so I had tricked her through excessive preparation and several tricks. Luckily, since then, my power grew so much that she was not intimidating toward me anymore. It was the reason I was not afraid of poking fun of her. “Cornelia, before we start, you have an apology to make to Marianne, for scaring her that badly.” </p><p>Marianne looked panicked, no doubt afraid of her reaction, but rather than pulling back, she slid next to me, her tight hug showing her trust. Cornelia, on the other hand, looked like she had swallowed a lemon, but she didn’t dally much before opening her mouth, no doubt aware that it was the much better option compared to the treatment of the previous night. </p><p>“I’m sorry, Mary,” she murmured. “I was shocked by Caesar’s surprise presence, and lashed out. I hope you can forgive me,” she said, as sincere as she could manage. Anger was still present in her tone, but I let it slide. I wanted to teach her obedience, but I didn’t want to extinguish the fire that was making her unique. I liked her passion, it just needed to be under my control… </p><p>“I understand,” Marianne said with a soft smile, though still a bit hesitant. She was skittish enough to be badly affected by Cornelia’s surprise lashing out. “It was a rather difficult situation.” </p><p>“Good,” I said, cutting in to dispel the sudden seriousness. I didn’t want to waste time when they have a lot of interesting things they could do to have fun. “Now, kiss and seal the apology,” I ordered. </p><p>Marianne blushed, while Cornelia smirked, though when their lips met directly in front of me as they leaned in from either side, neither was unenthusiastic. After all, my presence might have put a damper in their relationships, but they were lovers for a long time, and with that background came closeness. </p><p>[More than 5 levels of difference! No Experience]</p><p>The notification of no experience appeared once more, like the System was telling me that I was wasting time. It wasn’t right, of course. Watching them kiss slowly and sensuously might not help me gain experience or progress my companion system, but watching them was a reward of its own. </p><p>As I watched, my blanket rose, lifted by my rock hard erection. I sighed in contentment as I felt a hand wrapping around the base, gently moving up and down. Surprisingly, it was Marianne that took the initiative. Cornelia noticed it when my breath hitched for a moment. She pulled back from the kiss for a second. “Someone is enthusiastic,” she murmured before kissing her once again, this time sharp and passionate. Her hand joined the little game that was going under the blanket, taking the responsibility of the topside. </p><p>I put my hands on their bodies, softly caressing their sensitive spots. I avoided the obviously-sensitive areas, but after all the times we had spent together, I knew how to play their bodies like a flute. Even the most casual touches carried the ability to make them pant and moan helplessly. </p><p>I started slow, wanting to warm them up properly. I had big objectives for the evening. Cornelia had access to one of my biggest secrets, and at this point with their relationship repaired, it was inevitable that Marianne would learn it sooner and later. She had neither the personality nor the ambition to betray my secret, but giving her an even better reason to keep my secrets was a good idea. </p><p>Especially since there were no drawbacks for doing so. </p><p>With that in mind, I decided to start the proceedings with my shy blonde. I leaned down and pressed my lips against her neck, making her moan gently. Her back arched, and she would have broken off the kiss she was sharing with Cornelia if it wasn’t for Cornelia’s initiative to grab her hair to force maintain her kiss. I couldn’t help but smirk in amusement as I watched Cornelia’s rougher habits immediately showed itself. I didn’t say anything though, as Marianne was obviously enjoying it. </p><p>Marianne’s moans intensified as I moved down. First, I nibbled her collarbone to make her gasp loudly. Meanwhile, Cornelia moved until she was on top of me. At first, I had assumed that she was looking for easier access to Marianne, so, she surprised me greatly when she pushed her panties to the side sank herself onto my shaft, making me moan, all without interrupting her kiss with Marianne. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 27%]</p><p>It would be a lie if I said I wasn’t surprised. Combined with her unconscious acceptance of my mark, it suggested that I had misread Cornelia’s personality. I had thought that she was either a sadist or a naturally domineering person, who I had to force and break before remaking her as a better person. But the ease she adapted to my presence and my position over her suggested that maybe the situation was different. Maybe she was looking to connect with people, but her need to protect herself due to her family’s complicated situation had been forcing her to always hold the upper hand. </p><p>Now that she found herself linked to me —she was smart enough to realize that my revealing such a big secret, I was staking a claim, and there was no retreat for her— she was slowly shedding herself of her earlier behaviors. Of course, the pleasure I provided had a rather big impact on the process as well. </p><p>In simpler terms, I managed to fuck the bitch out of her. </p><p>However, as Cornelia started rocking on my lap, my thoughts shifted back to the present. It was unfair for me not to pay attention to the beautiful girls that were doing their best to make me enjoy life. I grabbed Cornelia’s lacy lingerie, and ripped it off just enough to reveal her breasts, but leaving the ripped fabric to hand on her body, partially covering her. Dressed like that, her red hair waving freely with her every move, she was even sexier than her naked state. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 31%]</p><p>As I enjoyed Cornelia’s tightness, however, I used my Tantric abilities to carefully observe her soul space, checking to see if there was any side effect from her forced achievement. The view of her soul space was much clearer than the last time, understandable considering my Tantric skills had almost doubled since yesterday. Increasing the progress of the companion feature helped as well. </p><p>Seeing that the achievement integrated itself without an issue, I shifted my attention to the borders of her soul space, the reason for her inability to level up. Observing Aviada while she leveled naturally taught me a lot, and Helga’s assisted leveling taught me even more about it. Ultimately, it was a lack of potential, reflected itself as the absence of elasticity. The solution was simple. I just needed to strengthen her soul space to ensure the barrier could expand.  </p><p>Of course, simple didn’t mean easy. I dumped a great amount of mana inside her, carefully directing it so that it was absorbed by the borders of her soul space rather than anything else. </p><p>[-723 Mana] </p><p>Despite the mana expenditure that would leave a weaker mage unconscious, her soul space barely reacted. Of course, I wasn’t exactly hurting for mana with my regeneration perk active —especially when I was about to receive a new one from Cornelia soon— so a barely noticeable improvement was more than okay for me. </p><p>I was about to continue my enjoyable treatment, when Marianne decided to pull away from Cornelia’s kiss. “You already started?” Marianne gasped in shock as she looked at where Cornelia was trying to melt into my body. “It’s not fair! You were with him yesterday as well! It’s my turn!” </p><p>I couldn’t help but laugh at the point she had suddenly decided to push through her shyness and defend what she saw as her right. I wanted to shift, but two things prevented me. First, I was making progress with Cornelia’s soul space, and didn’t want to risk it. </p><p>Second, I didn’t want to pull out of Cornelia’s warm grasp until I could paint her insides, especially when she decided to show initiative.</p><p>“Well, you should have acted faster,” I said to Marianne even as I slapped her ass. Her tight, beautiful ass jiggled beautifully under my touch while Marianne moaned helplessly. </p><p>“Not fair,” she moaned playfully. </p><p>“I’m sure I can come up with some kind of compensation,” I countered before I dived down to her bosom, leveraging the revealing corset she was wearing by clamping on her nipple, biting softly. Marianne moaned loudly. “How’s this as an alternative?”</p><p>“Well,” she murmured, “I might indeed deign to wait for a few minutes if you were to continue to pamper me like that,” she answered, but before she could say anything else, Cornelia stole her lips again.</p><p>Cornelia was in deep arousal. Her hips were grinding mercilessly back and forth like she was trying to break my bones, her moans rising despite Marianne’s lips. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 31%]</p><p>“I have a better idea,” I suddenly said even as I wrapped my arms around Cornelia’s waist and pulled her off, and threw her on the bed, her back hitting the soft mattress hard enough to make a sound. Both girls froze at the sudden change, but before they could react, I was already between Cornelia’s legs, once again sliding inside her warmth. “Sit on her face,” I ordered Marianne as I started impaling Cornelia repeatedly in a merciless rhythm, our flesh clapping mixing with her cries of joy. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 35%]</p><p>Marianne followed my orders immediately, pulling down her panties to reveal her delicious entrance, shining with arousal. She reached for her corset as well, but I gestured her to keep it on. Since the corset was low enough to reveal her beautiful breasts, I wanted to keep it. Also, its contrast with Cornelia’s black lingerie —though mostly scraps at this point— added a touch of color to our embrace as well. </p><p>Cornelia responded immediately as Marianne sat on her face, her tongue darting out in a furious dance. I grabbed Marianne’s hair and pulled her close into a searing kiss, tasting Cornelia from her lips. Under a concentrated assault, Marianne started gasping and moaning, some suppressed by my lips, some overcoming the barrier they presented. And when I put one of my hands on her breast and sank my fingers into her inviting flesh, her cries got even louder.  </p><p>With Marianne properly distracted, I turned my attention back to Cornelia, and not just the way she was tightening around my shaft. I pushed another dose of mana inside her, once again strengthening her soul space. At the same time, I put my other hand on her chest, squeezing her smaller, but also firmer, breasts. </p><p>[-357 Mana]</p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 39%]</p><p>This time, despite spending less mana, the impact was clearer. Ultimately, it might be the pleasure she was feeling. Trying to deal with all different aspects, her control over her power was weaker, helping me to manipulate her soul space easier. </p><p>That, or it was simply because of the progress of the companion acquisition —which was also progressing quite a bit faster than the previous times, but I had a feeling that it had a link with my increased level or heightened charisma. </p><p>Whatever it was, it was working perfectly, so I continued ramming inside her, each push making her moan louder. However, I had a simple and fun way of testing that. A brief moment of concentration allowed me to solidify air into an accurate replica of my shaft. I pulled away from kissing Marianne for a moment, only to jam that in her mouth. She gagged and wheezed, but when I pulled back, the magical dildo was shining with her spit. </p><p>“Couldn’t you use a spell to lubricate it?” Marianne asked exasperatedly. </p><p>“I could have, but that’s more fun,” I answered. I cast another spell, this time to prepare Cornelia’s backdoor to surprise intrusion. Biomancy was not just useful for destroying the undead. I slowly pushed the dildo in her backdoor without breaking a stride. Cornelia tried to cry, but Marianne was in place to silence her perfectly. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 42%]</p><p>[-235 Mana]</p><p>Despite the overwhelming increase in pleasure, I only detected a small improvement at the ease I was able to strengthen Cornelia’s soul space, which could be accounted for increased companion interaction. Not exactly a drawback, but good to know, though I was a bit sad to lose the excuse to have a spectacular orgy. </p><p>On second thought, nothing was preventing me to have one. </p><p>As I continued to impale Cornelia from multiple angles, Marianne started to have a jealous look on her face whenever she pulled away from the kiss we shared, especially as Cornelia started to lose control of her tongue as she experienced yet another climax, trembling and gasping, but still taking it like a champion. However, despite the pleasure, it was starting to make Marianne a bit neglected. </p><p>A change in position was in order, I decided. Another spell ensured that the toy in Cornelia’s backdoor continued to pump while I pulled out. Marianne pulled back, reading the situation correctly. I lay on my back, and Cornelia immediately climbed up on my lap, her hands on my chest to balance herself as she tried to ride me while she was trembling with the after-effects of the orgasms she had experienced. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 46%]</p><p>[-467 Mana]</p><p>“Are you going to wait there, or are you going to give me a taste as well,” I asked Marianne, and she sat on my face, though she was watching Cornelia jumping up and down with a not-inconsiderable amount of jealousy. </p><p>My tongue darted out, circling around her clit and brushed against her sensitive spots. “Yesss!” Marianne cried loudly, suddenly much happier about getting an oral treatment. Luckily, Cornelia was far too gone to notice the reason, or even if she did, feel jealous. She was too busy enjoying the moment. </p><p>Of course, it wasn’t just my —rather phenomenal— lovemaking that was making her climax common and effective at the same time. No, she was being extra sensitive, because the treatment she was receiving in her soul space was affecting her mood and amplifying her pleasure. </p><p>With Marianne sitting on my face, I couldn’t see anything, but the sound of their kissing was rather clear. I let it continue, but as Cornelia tightened once more, I felt climax knocking on my door as well. I could have hold myself back, but the idea of filling Cornelia to the brim was simply too tempting. Finally, I exploded, and sent a wide mana rush along with it. </p><p>[-1210 Mana]</p><p>[Achievement: Border Breaker.

I barely had enough time to select my new skill —Biomancy, as the necromancers were still the biggest threat, and I needed to be ready for them— before Cornelia tightened, signaling her own climax. </p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 50% - Second Stage Completed +10000 Exp]</p><p>[Mana regeneration perk activated.

I was happy as well, because unlike Cornelia, I could feel that the achievement sinking into her soul space without my intervention. It wasn’t a surprise though, as the earlier achievement had already confirmed it. </p><p>Her level limit was finally raised. </p><p>It was yet another impossible thing I had achieved. But before I could consider its implications, Cornelia collapsed against my chest, the strain from a combination of her transformation, a new achievement, and several orgasms finally overcoming her willpower. </p><p>It wouldn’t have prevented me from having some deep thoughts, of course, but Marianne pushed Cornelia to the side in an instant. “My turn!” she growled as she took Cornelia’s place. She impaled herself to my shaft, which was already erect thanks to my ridiculously high endurance.  </p><p>It seemed that I had a jealous blonde to placate… </p><p>————</p><p>[Level: 22    Experience: 248100 / 253000 </p><p>Strength: 28    Charisma: 38</p><p>Precision: 21    Perception: 25</p><p>Agility: 25     Manipulation: 30</p><p>Speed: 23       Intelligence: 30</p><p>Endurance: 22      Wisdom: 32</p><p>HP: 2618 / 2618\tMana: 1820 / 3410        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [75/100]</p><p>Expert Arcana [75/75]   </p><p>Expert  Elemental [75/75]     </p><p>Advanced Subterfuge [50/50]         </p><p>Basic Speech [25/25]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p>",
