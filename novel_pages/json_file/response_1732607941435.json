I am pretty sure that I was….</p><p>Where was I again?</p><p>I couldn’t remember everything clearly.</p><p>I went to sleep and then….and then now I am here.</p><p>What is this place?</p><p>I lay aside my thoughts in favour of pushing off the weight on top of me.</p><p>Not being able to breathe properly was not facilitating my thinking capabilities.</p><p>It was weird.</p><p>What even was this?</p><p>I touched the weight and suddenly a terrifying pit formed in my stomach.</p><p>I felt an arm.</p><p>I was limp.</p><p>There was no feeling of….life in it.</p><p>A severe chill ran down my spine as I scrambled and pushed aside the….whoever was on top of me.</p><p>The body, while heavy, rolled down and fell aside with a thump and I quickly crawled away, almost stumbling from the now visible dead man.</p><p>His blood was almost dry on the floor and on me.</p><p>But he was not alone.</p><p>No.</p><p>There was another person beside him who was covering me.</p><p>A woman.</p><p>I looked at my hands and they were dyed crimson.</p><p>I felt my heart beating faster as I struggled to breathe.</p><p>I quickly tried to wipe it off of my hands but it had dried already. I rubbed my hands on my clothes only to realize that my clothes were the same.</p><p>I was soaked in their dried blood.</p><p>I tried to call out but found out that I couldn’t speak. Hysteria attack was making me unable to form any thoughts.</p><p>I tried desperately to control my breathing but at that moment I realized something, my <a href=\"https://body….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">body….it</a> was much smaller.</p><p>I looked at my hands again and they looked like that of a child.</p><p>I touched myself all over and it was as if I had shrunk into the form of a child.</p><p>No.</p><p>I couldn’t feel the scar on the side of my forehead, nor were there any stitches on my arm from the time I had an accident. This….</p><p>I looked around the house and saw that it had almost collapsed on one side.</p><p>The house was relatively unharmed on the other side though.</p><p>The house’ interior was dark but I could still see everything inside the house very clearly.</p><p>There was a mirror on the other side of the room and I headed towards the mirror dreading the scene that awaited me there.</p><p>The face I saw on the other side of the mirror was that of a purple haired, purple eyed boy.</p><p>I looked around the unharmed part and saw a picture of the man and woman with a child and felt my heart clench tightly.</p><p>They were….</p><p>Looking at the picture, I saw the resemblance of the people with my new face. The man had black hair but bluish purple eyes and the woman had lovely purple hair.</p><p>I tried looking around desperately trying to find out where I was.</p><p>I went to the window and tried to stare out of the house.</p><p>The sky was….purple.</p><p>There was a huge moon in the sky but it seemed so unnatural.</p><p>I looked around and saw smoke rising out from the few houses sparsely dotting the area.</p><p>Suddenly a sense of powerlessness overwhelmed me and I slumped onto the ground with a thump.</p><p>Is this?</p><p>Am I really?</p><p>No.</p><p>This must be a big nightmare.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>I will wake up in a while. Probably someone at home will notice me seizing up and wake me.</p><p>Nightmares like these can happen sometimes. Isn’t this what we call a Lucid Dream?</p><p>Something that feels so real that we cannot even differentiate it from what is true and what is a dream.</p><p>Yes. I will close my eyes and this will disappear.</p><p>I will just close my eyes.</p><p>“Just close my eyes and get my mind to the right <em>status</em>.”</p><p>A blue screen appeared in front of me and I scrambled back almost in shock looking at the screen that looked almost as if out of a sci-fi.</p><p><strong>Host: Elias Rimmon</strong></p><p><strong>Body: 2</strong></p><p><strong>Mind: 4</strong></p><p><strong>Spirit: 3</strong></p><p><strong>Magic: 2</strong></p><p>I tried to touch the screen but my hand passed through it.</p><p>I tried again but to the same result.</p><p>Getting frustrated I punched the screen but my hands passed through the screen and hit the side of the wall, scratching my hand accidentally.</p><p>“AHH….”</p><p>I grabbed my hand back, caressing it softly with my other hand.</p><p>It was then I realized something.</p><p>I felt pain.</p><p>There were even some scratches on my hand.</p><p>This….this was not a dream.</p><p>Apparently that was more than enough to overwhelm my mind.</p><p>I fainted.</p><p><strong>- Scene Change –</strong></p><p>I slowly opened my eyes due to the light from the window.</p><p>I woke up to a white ceiling this time.</p><p>I remembered the situation I was in before fainting and raised my hands to look at them, hoping it to have been just a dream.</p><p>….</p><p>It wasn’t.</p><p>“The boy’s awake. Call for the doctor.” I heard a voice shout but I was too busy trying to collect myself to know what was happening.</p><p>Everything was so surreal.</p><p>Is this? Am I in someone else’s body?</p><p>What was that purple sky?</p><p>Am I even in the same world?</p><p>I felt a lump in my throat as I realized that I couldn’t return back home.</p><p>A sob escaped me as I realized the situation I was in.</p><p>Tears ran down my eyes as I laid on the bed thinking about my current situation.</p><p>I sensed a hand on my forehead and stopped.</p><p>“It’s fine, child. You are safe. I am sorry about your parents. We didn’t get the information until it was too late. No one in the area survived. Those accursed Fallen!”</p><p>!!!!</p><p>The who?</p><p>I slowly turned towards the man.</p><p>He was a relatively young looking man, in his twenties or at most thirties.</p><p>“It was a Fallen Angel raid on the village.  There were no survivors except you. I think they didn’t notice you because you were covered by your parents. <em>Sigh</em>.”</p><p>I was thinking about something else entirely.</p><p>Fallen Angels? What the hell?</p><p>“By the way, do you remember anything? Their faces, how many of them there were? It would help the Lady and her peerage take care of the situation and avenge the dead.” He asked, looking at me but my mind was racing at a high speed.</p><p>Fallen Angels? Peerage?</p><p>“Do you remember anything child?” he asked looking at my blank face.</p><p>I just shook my head.</p><p>I didn’t even know the name of this body’s parents.</p><p>What was my name again?</p><p>I think the blue screen had a name on the top.</p><p>How did it come again?</p><p>Ah….status.</p><p>“Child?”</p><p>I jumped back slightly at the call and the blue screen suddenly appearing on my face.</p><p><strong>Host: Elias Rimmon</strong></p><p><strong>Body: 2</strong></p><p><strong>Mind: 4</strong></p><p><strong>Spirit: 3</strong></p><p><strong>Magic: 2</strong></p><p>He put a hand on my head and I felt a light appear in his hand. A magic circle of sorts appeared in front of me as he did something.</p><p>I stiffened up but didn’t move.</p><p>“Extreme shock and mental trauma as expected of a survivor of such an incident. There is also physical and magical exhaustion. Do you remember anything, child? You don’t have to force yourself. Just nod. If not then it’s fine.”</p><p>I whispered the name on the screen, partly to check if it was really mine and partly to hear my own voice clearly.</p><p>“Elias Rimmon.”</p><p>The doctor paused for a bit and picked up a file. He turned the pages and then nodded to me. “That seems to be your name. Elias Rimmon. Anything else?”</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>I didn’t know anything?</p><p>“Well. Anything for example your parents name or the name of the place you stayed in was?”</p><p>I shook my head again.</p><p>He sighed lightly and then patted my head. “I am sorry for forcing this on you. It’s just that we could have used the information in case that group was planning any more attacks. I am sorry for your loss. My name is Aaron Brandt, a Mid Class Devil. You can also call me Doctor Brandt. Take some rest and inform the nurse if you have any problems.”</p><p>I barely managed to nod my head.</p><p>He kept the file beside me and left.</p><p>I sat there organizing the information that I had managed to collect.</p><p>Fallen Angels, Peerage, Mid Class Devil.</p><p>Purple sky.</p><p>This was all so similar to that one Light Novel I had read.</p><p>It was that damned show with overpowered nutjobs with the common sense of a tapeworm.</p><p>Nah, it couldn’t be. That was just a story.</p><p>….</p><p>Just to check my theory, I quietly looked side to side and saw no one and whispered in a barely audible voice to myself.</p><p>“God.”</p><p>Oww dammmmmmn!</p><p>I held my head and felt faint just by uttering God.</p><p>It was as if I was hit by a sledgehammer.</p><p>A burning hot sledgehammer.</p><p>It almost caused me to faint again but the pain kept me awake.</p><p>Dammit. It didn’t hurt that bad from what I remembered.</p><p>Wasn’t it supposed to just hurt a bit?</p><p>I laid down quietly thinking about my current situation while the pain subsided.</p><p>It was….I was in hell, wasn’t I?</p><p>I had somehow transmigrated into the body of a child.</p><p>Into what was probably the world of a Light Novel I had read in my past life?</p><p>The pain subsided after a few minutes and I looked around.</p><p>The hospital room was a small one and almost bare. Just a simple table with fruits or whatever it was, my file and a case with medicines and water.</p><p>I picked up the file.</p><p>The language however was not something I knew. I hadn’t inherited any memories from this body.</p><p>Apparently things were not going to be so convenient.</p><p>I sighed and kept the file back.</p><p>What am I even to do in this world?</p><p>Why was I sent here?</p><p>I didn’t know that either.</p><p>Was there a way back?</p><p>….</p><p>Yeah, fat chance.</p><p>I lied down and contemplated what to do from this point on.</p><p>After a while I took a fruit from the table and ate to recover some energy.</p><p>I had no idea what would become of me or if I would even be able to get food from here on out.</p><p>Soon after, the exhaustion caught up with me again and I fell asleep.</p><p> </p><p>I tried to get up and felt slight pain in my body. I had no idea how long I was asleep for.</p><p>There was no light outside the window. It was probably night time. Although, it was hard to tell with the purple sky and my new night vision.</p><p>I got up on my feet again and went to the window.</p><p>It seemed like a much better residential area compared to where I was before. The area looked like a city whereas my previous home looked like a small village-side settlement.</p><p>The purple sky looked weird even when looking at it a second time.</p><p>I sighed and got back sitting on my bed and closed my eyes.</p><p>Meditation helped my mind. It was a habit that my family had hammered into me since childhood.</p><p>Empty the mind and deep breaths.</p><p>Thirty minutes later, I had a clear enough mind to think about the current situation.</p><p>I had a basic plan in mind.</p><p>I do not know what will happen to me when I am released from this hospital or how to even pay for this treatment. Hell I didn’t even know how I came here in the first place.</p><p>If I am released, I don’t know who to rely on to support me.</p><p>Where to live, what to do to eat?</p><p>The only things I had with me are probably my memories which could be an object of danger to me if discovered. I am not even sure if the memories I have are relevant to this place or what time period this is or if it was even really the world I know of though. The only clue I had was the huge moon in the sky and the word peerage which meant that the Evil Pieces had already been invented at this point in time.</p><p>The second part that I have going in my favour is whatever this blue screen is.</p><p>Is it like a Gamer System?</p><p>Weren’t those things supposed to be really strong or something?</p><p>Status.</p><p>I called inside my mind and this time with a slight preparation, I was able to avoid the shock and not stumble.</p><p><strong>Host: Elias Rimmon</strong></p><p><strong>Body: 2</strong></p><p><strong>Mind: 4</strong></p><p><strong>Spirit: 4</strong></p><p><strong>Magic: 2</strong></p><p>Hmm?</p><p>There was an increase in the Spirit Stat.</p><p>I tried to think about it and suddenly the Spirit Stat was highlighted and a + sign appeared beside every other Stat except Spirit.</p><p>I thought of touching the Body Stat and the Body Stat increased to 3 while the Spirit stat was back to three.</p><p>I felt an immediate growth in my body. The outside looks were the same but I felt my power increase a lot.</p><p>Considering that it went from 2 to three, it was supposed to be a 50% increase but not quite. Still it was a lot.</p><p>The pain in my body also subsided a lot.</p><p>Now how did I gain that extra Spirit?</p><p>Was it through meditation?</p><p>There is no help button.</p><p>System?</p><p>….</p><p>Nope, no reply.</p><p>I decreased another one from Mind and put it to body and felt an increase in my strength again although I felt slightly sluggish. It was like my mind was slowed so I returned it back to the Mind Stat.</p><p>The last thing I need right now is a dulled mind.</p><p>The Spirit stat increased. Was it because I had recovered from the injury or that my soul had assimilated into this body?</p><p>Body was easy to understand.</p><p>Mind was also evident clearly.</p><p>Magic was more or less clear as well.</p><p>Spirit stat was the mysterious one.</p><p>Also if Spirit increased, does it mean I can train other stats to increase as well?</p><p>And what about magic?</p><p>Thinking about it more clearly, I decided not to bother with magic now. Experimenting with unknown esoteric energies without knowing anything about it doesn’t help.</p><p>Body can be increased with exercise. My body had just recovered and I don’t think I should exert my body more at this time.</p><p>Mind, I don’t know. Puzzles or something. Not really available.</p><p>Spirit is the only one left to train.</p><p>“What do I even do for that God dammit….ahhhhhh.”</p><p>I fell down clutching my head.</p><p>The pain.</p><p>This is the fucking underworld?</p><p>Why was his name effective here of all places?</p><p>Can’t he let the Devils live in peace?</p><p>I mean I was not even a devil dammit.</p><p>I clutched my head for a while and tried to breathe deeply.</p><p>I think I should keep my words to a minimum lest I use his name again.</p><p>Getting smacked in the head myself is fine but if others get the same pain, they might not take it well.</p><p>Moreover, a devil using his name was….a bad sign maybe.</p><p>The pain went away in a few minutes and I sat down and began to meditate again.</p><p>I took a look at the clock on the wall. It showed one hour.</p><p>Status</p><p><strong>Host: Elias Rimmon</strong></p><p><strong>Body: 3</strong></p><p><strong>Mind: 4</strong></p><p><strong>Spirit: 4</strong></p><p><strong>Magic: 2</strong></p><p>It was raised again.</p><p>So meditation helped to increase the Spirit stat.</p><p>That was all I needed to know.</p><p>Even with my years of practice, meditating for more than two hours at a stretch was a bit too much. So I could only do it for another hour before I checked and I had another point in Spirit, increasing it to five.</p><p>I took this chance to eat the rest of the fruits, filling my stomach and preparing for anything that might come.</p><p>It was almost dawn by then when I heard a sound on the door. The door opened and the doctor returned.</p><p>“I see that you are up. How have you been feeling?</p><p>I nodded my head slowly.</p><p>“Good. Let’s see how you are then.” He created a magic circle and a wave of light flashed over my body. “The body has recovered quite nicely. You can get discharged in a day. You will have to give a statement about the attack though. Do you remember anything?”</p><p>I shook my head again.</p><p>“Did you remember anything at all?” he asked again, a little worried this time.</p><p>I shook my head again.</p><p>“So a case of amnesia. Maybe due to shock or mental trauma. There were no physical injuries. No signs of magical attacks either.” He murmured to himself and then turned back to me. “I will inform the investigator. Be respectful. She is a Peerage Member of the Lady who rules over this entire area. She was also the one who brought you here and paid for your hospital charges. Be sure to thank her.”</p><p>I nodded to him quietly.</p><p>“Good. I will get you some health supplements. Eat these after the next meal.”</p><p>I nodded and after a few more checkups, he left.</p><p>I went back to my grinding while thinking about the new information I had learned.</p><p>This ‘She’ was someone who brought me here and she was the peerage member of the Lady of this entire surrounding lands.</p><p>She paid for the expenses.</p><p>So either she wants something from me or she is one of those rare kind ones.</p><p>I tried to throw in another Mediation session but two and a half hours of meditating made my body very sluggish.</p><p>The doctor said that my body had recovered so I could do some light exercises.</p><p>I decided to do just that.</p><p>After some light stretching, I did some sit ups and crunches. Push Ups were still a bit hard for my young body to do.</p><p>After being exhausted, I sat back for some meditation again.</p><p>Thirty minutes later, the door was opened and I broke out of my trance.</p><p>The nurse had come with a plate of food and some medicine.</p><p>She instructed me to eat those and be ready for the investigator to arrive and then started to clean the room.</p><p>I took the opportunity to eat the bread and whatever soup it was. It did have some meat in it.</p><p>After the meal, I took the opportunity to go to the toilet and get refreshed. The nurse had given me a set of clothes to wear to prepare for the investigator’s arrival.</p><p>I then sat and waited for the investigator.</p><p><strong>- Scene Change –</strong></p><p>I heard the door open and looked up to see a purple haired woman or rather girl, enter the room followed closely by the doctor.</p><p>Her hair was of a much lighter shade than mine and she had orange eyes.</p><p>I stared at her but then looked at the doctor giving me a slight glare and I remembered his warning, bowing quickly.</p><p>I looked up and saw the doctor was satisfied and nodded to me from behind her.</p><p>The girl gave me a slight nod too as she looked at the nurse who quickly left the room after bowing to her.</p><p>She looked back at me and said, “I’m sorry for reminding you of painful things but can you please tell me about anything you remember? It will help us catch the bad people who attacked your village.” She said in a very soft voice. She had a very beautiful voice, I thought.</p><p>I looked up at her and then at the doctor and then back at her and shook my head.</p><p>The doctor took the opportunity to explain. “My Lady, he….the child seems to have locked away his memories. He doesn’t seem to remember anything except his name. Not even his family, or his parent’s name. Such cases are normal in case of serious trauma. I have already checked and there are no signs of mental manipulation. Moreover, it is highly unlikely that they would resort to that. I could have tried to hypnotize him to try and bring back his memories but it is inadvisable in such cases. It may cause more harm than good to the child if that is done since his magic will react violently to protect his mind and prevent those stressful memories from being released.”</p><p>The Lady listened to everything the doctor said while I merely tried to keep my gaze on the ground. She gave me a look of pity.</p><p>“Were any relatives found?” she asked the doctor.</p><p>“No my Lady. The child was alone. He lived with his parents and from what we have in our reports; his grandparents had died in the civil war. The couple were trying to have a child for over four centuries and finally succeeded eight years ago with little Elias being the one. They owned a piece of land near their house and also had farmland. His father, Julius Rimmon had recently been promoted to Mid Class Devil around a decade ago while his mother Stella Rimmon was still preparing for the Promotion exams. The family mainly dealt with vegetables and some demonic beasts reared to cultivate the land. No past criminal records. A completely normal small family.”</p><p>It did give me a lot of information about the situation.</p><p>“The leftovers?” she asked again.</p><p>“We had sent people to collect whatever was left in the town and also in the child’s house. His family owned an account in the bank and a reasonable savings to last him a few years. The same was the case with other families which have been exterminated. The land was fine but the crops were all burned down and the beasts were killed. We have salvaged everything from the town we could. We just cannot send the child there alone. He wouldn’t survive.” The doctor added.</p><p>She took the file and studied it for a while.</p><p>I was quite tense as this would be the moment that decides my future.</p><p>The Lady thought for a while and then looked at the doctor. “The money from the village and everything except the land, liquidate all of it and send the funds to his account. I and my people made a mistake which caused the Fallen to slip through. Normally this money would go to the state and me as the ruler of this territory being assigned by my King so I can make this decision.” She then looked towards me and bowed slightly. “I am sorry, Elias.”</p><p>I shook my head quickly.</p><p>“I-it’s okay. T-thank you for saving me.”</p><p>She however shook her head. “No, it was your parents who saved you. They took on the Fallen Angel’s light spear directly through their bodies and covered for you. Never forget their sacrifice Elias.”</p><p>I nodded my head slowly.</p><p>The doctor was quiet while looking at the scene.</p><p>“As for him living, send him to my mansion’s servant quarters. He can stay there as it is unused till he is old enough to care for himself. I will inform the head servant.”</p><p>I bowed to her upon hearing this. “Thank you My Lady.”</p><p>She patted my head and got up slowly and after giving me one last look, she left.</p><p>The doctor followed her soon.</p><p>I slumped down to my seat at the turn of events.</p><p>I really owed it to the Lady whose name….I didn’t even know yet.</p><p>I didn’t have to wait much as the doctor soon returned. This time with another woman who looked to be in her forties and wore a French maid uniform.</p><p>“This is the child.” The doctor pointed towards me.</p><p>She looked towards me and nodded to the doctor.</p><p>“My Lady has explained to me about your arrangements. You will be released from the hospital tomorrow and I will send a maid to receive you. I will explain the rest when you reach the mansion.” She spoke in a stoic and no-nonsense tone.</p><p>I nodded and bowed slightly.</p><p>She turned and instructed the doctor about something that I didn’t hear and left.</p><p>He then entered the room and ruffled my hair. “You don’t even realize how lucky you are son. To be allowed to stay in that place? No men are allowed in that mansion. It is expressly reserved for the Lady and her fellow peerage members. There aren’t even male servants. You would probably be the only guy even allowed to go into the place even if it is only a servant’s quarters.” He smiled at me.</p><p>I didn’t understand what the big deal was but there was something more important that I wanted to ask him before anything.</p><p>“Sir.”</p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p>“I-I don’t know the Lady’s name or….anything else. Umm….could you please tell me the name of my savior?” I asked the man who had a bit of a shock on his face and then he slapped his head.</p><p>“Oh yes. I forgot about that. Okay here child, hmm, Elias. Sit. Let me tell you a bit about things. It’s my break time anyways.”</p><p>He sat beside me and explained. “The Lady who came with you was Lady Ingvild Leviathan. She is the granddaughter of the Original Satan Leviathan and one of the strongest Devils in the Underworld. There are rumors that she is even stronger than Lady Serafall who is the current Leviathan but Lady Ingvild is not the type who likes fighting so there have never been any challenges between the two.”</p><p>He then went on to explain more about how she was in-charge of the territory while my mind was whirling into something else entirely.</p><p>Ingvild Leviathan. I knew that name. She was the Granddaughter of the Original Leviathan who had a Sacred Gear rivaling a Longinus. She had been a victim of the Sleeping Disease for about a century before she had woken up somehow. She however had appeared after Trihexa was sealed and Serafall and other two Satans along with her.</p><p>But according to what he says, Serafall has been outside and Ingvild, it seems, has never fallen victim to the sleeping sickness in the first place.</p><p>“Umm, Sir. Who is the King that she mentioned?”</p><p>“Ah….yes. The King is Lady Grayfia Lucifuge. She is the owner of the entire borderlands and Lady Ingvild is her Bishop. We are only safe in these parts because Lady Lucifuge guards the borders and deals with any invasions or even slight attacks with extreme viciousness. She also is very kind to the people living in the Borderlands and our taxes are the lowest among all the territories of the Underworld. She is one of the Heroes of the Civil War and had even fought against Serafall Leviathan for the position of Leviathan back when the new Satans were elected. She had lost unfortunately but that doesn’t make her contribution any lower.”</p><p>My mind was however chaotic.</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>Grayfia Lucifuge?</p><p>What the fuck?</p><p>Wasn’t she like….you know, married to Sirzechs or something?</p><p>Why was she here guarding the Borderlands?</p><p>“Sir.”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>“Who is Lord Lucifuge then? Is Lady Grayfia married?”</p><p>He quieted down and then and then muttered in a whisper “If not for those rumors….” He suddenly quieted down realizing what he had spoken and shook his head. The jovial man’s face looked like it had just eaten a fly. “Listen Elias. Lady Lucifuge is our ruler. She has done too much for the Borderlands and treats us as her own family. She might seem aloof but she is a very caring person. So….if you hear any rumors, especially now that you are going to live in that mansion, don’t ever believe them.” He spoke in a serious voice and I nodded hurriedly. “As for your question. Lady Lucifuge is not married. She….has had a bad history with someone and has since then avoided any and all men. There have been several hundreds of men who have proposed to her for marriage but she just rejected them all. There is no Lord Lucifuge and only Lady Grayfia is the sole survivor of the Lucifuge House. You are going to that mansion so remember this fact well. Never speak of other men, especially Sirzechs Lucifer there.”</p><p>….</p><p>I had understood one thing by then and that was that I had no idea about this world.</p><p>Sirzechs and Grayfia are not married but somehow Sirzechs is a forbidden subject in the place as well.</p><p>“You don’t need to worry about those things now. Lady Ingvild is probably one of the kindest people you could have encountered. I don’t think anyone else would have given you this opportunity. I also serve as the doctor of the servants of the mansion and thus know Mrs. Berta Colls, the Head Maid of the mansion. She is my second cousin to be exact. In any case, if you need any help, you can contact me. I will give your bank and money details to Berta. I don’t think you were admitted to any schools, were you?”</p><p>“I….I don’t think so Sir. I couldn’t read the letters in the book.” I pointed towards the file.</p><p>“Hmm, I see. In that case, it would be better if you get admitted. Your village’s savings are enough for you to be admitted to a school and continue until you complete your studies to get a job. Learning the basics at the very least is necessary so that you don’t get tricked by anyone.”</p><p>I nodded and we chatted for an hour or so.</p><p>He seemed like a good man.</p><p>I got to learn many things from him.</p><p>He was a thousand years old.</p><p>He had seen the end of the Great War and the entirety of the Civil War. His child and wife had both passed away in the Civil War. They died due to not receiving treatment at the right time.</p><p>He has studied medicine since then so that he could save the lives of other people.</p><p>To avoid others suffering the same way his child and wife did.</p><p>I found myself respecting the old man a bit.</p><p>I also got to learn about the devil society a bit and what I needed to focus on.</p><p>A plan formed in my mind as I finally had something to work with and a definite target in my mind now.</p><p>I spend the rest of the day, alternating between light exercises and meditation.</p><p><strong>- Scene Change –</strong></p><p>“This will be your living quarters. Now pay attention. You were allowed by Lady Ingvild to live here but that does not mean you are allowed into the mansion. The Servant Quarter you live in also has a door outside the compound and that is the one you will be using. If you need anything, you can inform me through the gate or other maids. Since you are staying here, you will be expected to take care of your own matters like cleaning and clothing. I will provide you with a certain amount of allowance from your accounts every month. In case of any purchase that goes beyond your allowance, you are required to inform me and I will accompany you to buy it. Am I clear on this?” She spoke very sternly. It was like one of my kindergarten teachers. Stern but quite caring. “Aaron has informed me that you haven’t been admitted to any schools before this. It will be done in a week and you can attend your classes from then on.”</p><p>I nodded again.</p><p>“The food will be delivered to you three times a day by a maid. It will be kept in your living room in case you are absent. You are not to allow anyone access to the house without permission. Am I clear on that?”</p><p>I nodded once more.</p><p>“Very well, in that case, you can go inside now. I will take my leave.” She did pause once more and added. “You will be staying in the mansion, even if not a staff member, you are expected to keep to a certain standard so as to not shame the name of the owners of the house. Keep this in mind. I will teach you proper manners to act in presence of those at a higher standing than you and you will do well to keep that in mind. Is that understood?”</p><p>I nodded but this time she didn’t have it.</p><p>“Answer with your words. It is impolite to not use words when questioned.”</p><p>“Y-yes Ma'am.”</p><p>“Good. You may take your leave now. There are some books in your room which have been prepared in advance. Use this week to make yourself familiar with them.”</p><p>This said she left for her work as I looked around the room.</p><p>It was a two bedroom quarters with a kitchen, bathroom and toilet and a small garden of sorts along the walls of the Mansion. The Mansion itself was ginormous. The gardens alone were around five hundred meters wide around each side of the mansion. It looked like a palace of sorts of olden times.</p><p>I shook my head and went inside the room. There were a few books on the book shelf as Berta had stated.</p><p>The system in the Underworld is very complicated, especially the promotions into higher classes.</p><p>The father of this body’s previous owner had worked for about five hundred years before he was promoted. The promotion was generally done through three means. First, you can make contracts.</p><p>This however was easier said than done.</p><p>Low Class Devils like me, yes, I am a Low Class Devil, the scrub of the scrub, cannot go into the human world and as such cannot make contracts except for very specific circumstances where they are taken as servants of High Class Devils who take responsibility for bringing them into the human world and look over them.</p><p>This was like winning a lottery.</p><p>Even then, a normal Low Class Devil would take a decade of dedicated deals to make it to the said mark of being recommended for a Middle Class Devil. Then after a recommendation from a High Class Devil, they are allowed to give an exam and upon succeeding, they are promoted to a Middle Class Devil.</p><p>The second method was well, catch the attention of a High Class and get recruited into a Peerage and fight Rating Games. If your team does well, you could become a Mid Class Devil in around half a decade at best.</p><p>There was also the case with merits for the Underworld which is what happened to the cast of the Light Novel that I had read. Participating in battles for the sake of the Underworld and you could get extra merits worth years of making deals and the decade long time can be shortened quite significantly.</p><p>The last one was for the natural born Low Class Devil like me and Stella and Julius Rimmon, this body’s parents. They have to sit for what is equivalent to a world-wide exam among the Low Class Devils all over the underworld. This exam is significantly harder than the normal Middle Class Devil Promotion Exams because there is no perquisite of making deals. It however is extremely strict and there are only about two thousand Middle Class Devils promoted every decade. That’s like two hundred per year more or less on average.</p><p>It is also costly.</p><p>Low Class Devils have a much lower earning power due to the shit tier educational facilities provided to the Underworld. They only teach the Low Class Devils how to do basic mathematics and how to read words so that they are not useless in day to day work. There are obviously schools for higher education but those are costly as fuck. It was one of the reasons Julius needed five centuries to pass the exams. The examination fees are expensive but the main cost comes from the schools. It was because he couldn’t afford to receive an education in these schools.</p><p>Those old bastards know that if the Low Class Devils are taught, they will rise much faster than their lazy asses could ever do so while they do not close all avenues due to the fear of revolt(they do need cannon fodder in case of the reincarnated devil protests), they make the promotion requirements near impossible for the common Low Class Devils.</p><p>It also happened to be 5 years till these examinations happened, well four and half to be exact and I intend to take part in the examinations.</p><p>As for the Middle Class Devils, they are allowed to participate in making deals in the Human World independently but they have to submit a part, thirty percent of their earnings to the government. They also have to apply for a license to do so and that part is expensive as well.</p><p>I shook my head at the fact that it normally takes five decades to around two centuries worth of Deal making, and that is by staying there for that period of time to make up for the requirements, to fulfill the requirements for being allowed to take the examination and that too only with the recommendation of another three High Class Devils or an Ultimate Class Devil.</p><p>Now, we come to the general education beyond basic Mathematics and words.</p><p>After the basic education, the people can take up apprenticeships, which let me mention are rare, under any working person and learn their crafts. They basically treat the recruit as a slave for a lack of better word more often than not. I was warned by Aaron to not sign any such contracts or they might bind me by law for centuries. Apparently there had been many such cases before and now such contracts cannot be binding for more than three hundred years by law unless under exceptional cases. The new government wanted to avoid such messes and minor revolts that were caused when High Class Devils forced the Low Class Devils like this.</p><p>Now they do it without any contracts.</p><p>There is also the alternative to take professional courses, which are again….expensive.</p><p>Really, the education line is always lucrative.</p><p>There is also the fact that except the children of the Pillar Devils and Ultimate Class Devils, every child born will be one rank lower than their parents or to be more specific, the parent having a lower rank.</p><p>So two Mid Class Devils marry, their child will be a Low Class Devil.</p><p>A High Class, non-pillar Devil marries a Mid Class Devil; their child will again be a Low Class Devil.</p><p>Two High Class non-pillar Devils marry each other and their child can be a Mid Class Devil.</p><p>So with the buttloads of new Reincarnated Devils coming up every year, there will probably never be any shortage of Low Class Devils.</p><p>The Low Class Devils cannot access high level magic normally. Sure they can be taught by others but legally they cannot purchase such magic or even apply for Advanced Magic Classes in the Underworld. The same goes for the purchases of many different things that can be termed as dangerous.</p><p>For now, I have a few short term goals.</p><p>First, figure out all the powers of my Status Screen and System.</p><p>Second, learn the words of the Devil Language.</p><p>Third, prepare for the examinations and become a Mid Class Devil.</p><p>Fourth, grind.</p><p>Yesterday’s grinding had increased my points to a reasonable level. That said from what the Doctor said, I am at the level of a Human Child at the moment.</p><p>Low Class Devils are supposed to be ten times stronger than that.</p><p>On an average, if I take a Human Adult’s Stats to be ten, then a Low Class Devil’s Stats would be one hundred.</p><p>I had no idea how high that range went but I wasn’t even a Low Class Devil yet and that quite literally sucked.</p><p>Then again I was an eight year old and I had time to become stronger.</p><p>I looked at my Stats once more.</p><p><strong>Host: Elias Rimmon</strong></p><p><strong>Body: 4</strong></p><p><strong>Mind: 4</strong></p><p><strong>Spirit: 7</strong></p><p><strong>Magic: 2</strong></p><p>I still have a long way to go to become someone significant in this world.</p><p>With that in mind I started with the books explaining the Devil alphabet that taught kids how to read.</p><p><strong>- Two months later –</strong></p><p>I mustered all my strength to push myself up for the last pushup before finally falling on the floor. I heaved on the floor, sweating profusely.</p><p>These two months have been very educating, especially after I somehow dealt with the shock of coming or rather being thrown into this world so suddenly.</p><p>The school was like a primary school in the human world, just worse. They were actually meant for children at least above sixteen. The teachers taught the alphabet and it was relatively easy.</p><p>It was ancient Hebrew apparently.</p><p>There were twenty two letters total in the alphabet.</p><p>The words were easier to pick up once I got the hang of it. Thankfully the number system was the same and once I learned the numbers, I was pretty much done. I had a degree in engineering in my previous life. I would jump off a cliff myself if I had any problems with this level of Math.</p><p>The style of teaching however was not suited at all for students. It was also evident why. There were only adults and I might have been the youngest one there. General Low Class Devils save their money by teaching their children how to read and write themselves.</p><p>I however had no such privilege.</p><p>While Berta did teach me manners and etiquette a few times a week when she came to inspect how I was taking care of the quarters, she didn’t teach me anything beyond it.</p><p>That said I didn’t fault the woman for it. She was already doing more than she was required to. She could have thrown me in a room for all I know and that would have been fine.</p><p>I had no idea what Ingvild did or said to her but the woman has been utterly professional and I could respect that.</p><p>On the other hand, her non-interference had helped me a lot.</p><p>It gave me time to indulge in whatever I wanted, which was grinding.</p><p>I discovered some things about my System which honestly make it a perfect training cheat.</p><p>The more we train, the more we advance but the harder it gets to advance too.</p><p>I however can bypass that scenario completely.</p><p>I can advance in a stat and reassign it to a Stat I am not training and train it back again. There is no increase in training time for me by doing so.</p><p>For example, I could exercise for an hour and gain a point in the Body Stat. The next point will take one hour and let’s say twenty minutes and the next one, another one hour and forty minutes or so.</p><p>This however is completely avoided if I reassign my earned point from Body to let’s say Mind or Spirit. The body’s level remains the same and there is no increase in the training time.</p><p>The High Class Devils of the Pillar Houses and the Satan Clans were truly privileged. They were born with stronger innate potential so that even if they don’t train, they can become a High Class Devil by adulthood. Their blood increases their body’s strength while their souls increase their magical potential.</p><p>I finally figured out the real use of the Spirit Stat. It increases the strength of my soul and the Magical Potential of the user.</p><p>This basically means that as long as I have a high enough Spirit Stat, my Magic Stat will passively grow to that level.</p><p>There were however many functions that I had no idea about or at least the relationship between the different Stats.</p><p>That said I was finally at the level of a Low Class Devil.</p><p><strong>Host: Elias Rimmon</strong></p><p><strong>Body: 12</strong></p><p><strong>Mind: 187</strong></p><p><strong>Spirit: 180</strong></p><p><strong>Magic: 50</strong></p><p>My stats if reassigned could have the stats for a decent Low Class Devil.</p><p>The reason why I haven’t put my stats in Body and Magic and instead Mind and Spirit were because Spirit increased the passive growth of Magic so I needed it at an all-time high because it helped me learn and remember things, concentrate, control my emotions and all other mental facilities.</p><p>High Level Magicians could launch insane amounts of magical attacks simultaneously. This does take magic obviously but it also takes mental power.</p><p>A high Mind Stat is always appreciated.</p><p>The second reason was more obvious.</p><p>The improvement in Body and Magic, especially Magic would be noticeable.</p><p>I don’t want to be noticed right now.</p><p>I did discover a strange thing though.</p><p>It was probably the fastest way of training three of my Stats at the same time. Any sane devil would have called me crazy but I could see the real-time effects of the method and thus I knew of its effectiveness.</p><p>It was to use ‘His’ name.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Higher Spirit stat helped reduce the pain but the best effect was when my Spirit Stat was lower. The pain was hard to bear but I had tested and at 12 Spirit, after saying his name around a dozen times and bearing the pain in a short interval, after the pain subsided, I gained a Spirit Stat.</p><p>It was an incredible discovery.</p><p>It was accidental too.</p><p>I made a theory about it too.</p><p>Saying ‘His’ name helped was like a spiritual attack against all Devils.</p><p>The stronger the Devil, the stronger their souls and thus weaker the damage caused by said attack.</p><p>At around 100 in Spirit, the attack seemed like someone knocked my head with their knuckles. It was painful but not unbearable.</p><p>It did take around fifty to seventy such chants of ‘His’ name to increase my Spirit at that level.</p><p>My Demonic Power also helped to mitigate the damage and the pain and thus the increase in the Magic Stat.</p><p>The mental strain probably increased the Mind Stat.</p><p>This method is by far the fastest method to train any Stat I had.</p><p>It took ten minutes to net me a Spirit Stat but the only drawback was that my head hurt like hell. The pain subsided soon after when I transferred the stats back to the Spirit though so it was still something I frequently did.</p><p>I wonder what Michael would think if he found out about this method.</p><p>The System, God set to punish devils being used as a whetstone to make a Devil stronger.</p><p>Yeah, they would probably hunt me down just to clear out the shame.</p><p>I slumped on the chair and steadied my breath.</p><p>It was already 2 am. School and normal studies along with Berta’s lessons don’t quite leave much time for me to train. That said, knowing about the world is of the utmost importance. I cannot skive on that.</p><p>The Borderlands is the area which is basically its namesake, the area which separates the parts of the Underworld owned by the Devils and the Fallen Angels.</p><p>This means that there are often attacks and skirmishes, although never in the main cities like the one where I am staying, Bartol. It was a city under Ingvild Leviathan and unless the strongest Fallen Angels attacked this place, it would be a one-sided massacre of the Fallen to even think of such a thing.</p><p>Although Ingvild didn’t stay in this city, her strength and fame was more than enough to ensure its safety.</p><p>And I was staying in the mansion of such a person.</p><p>Obviously such a thing will attract attention.</p><p>And it did.</p><p>I was approached by people and even now am approached by people who ask about what it is like inside the mansion.</p><p>There were even shocking rumors that I might be a Leviathan Descendant, what with the hair colour I share with Ingvild although hers is of a much lighter shade.</p><p>It was not well known but Leviathan Descendants could only be girls so that was out immediately. But as I said, this information was not well known.</p><p>I found out about this from Dr. Aaron who visited me every once in a while. He has been working for the House for over a century now and was privy to such facts.</p><p>And there went all my hopes of having a cheat family power or lineage to rely on maybe.</p><p>Aaron has been very helpful to me because I listened to his stories. The man was a treasure trove of information and I have verified it many times. It is never wrong.</p><p>I had obviously denied everything and even explained my situation so as to not cause any problems and not attract unwanted attention towards me.</p><p>It worked for most of the people but still, there were some people who were still quite suspicious.</p><p>On the other hand, Aaron had helped me with other advice including a healthy diet, because I had no idea which ingredients are what in this place. This was when I told him about increasing my physical workout soon and wanted advice on what food to eat to help me. Apparently, demonic beast’s meat is good for the growth of Demonic Power. My family’s business did involve rearing some demonic beasts too.</p><p>These things are however difficult to get and thus very expensive.</p><p>I am however lucky as the food served in the mansion is also sent to me and I do get everything which they get, which is the best quality of food.</p><p>Apparently Berta did favour me in this way.</p><p>Aaron explained that she also lost her family in the Civil War. But unlike Aaron, she cut herself off from the rest of the world. Whereas Aaron dedicates himself to the people to prevent anyone from facing the same end as his family, Berta avoids getting close to anyone lest she lose them again.</p><p>With the incredibly long lives of Devils, such pain can be hard to deal with.</p><p>Another thing that Aaron helped me with was….Magic.</p><p>Yes, Magic.</p><p>As we know, Devil’s Magic is based on imagination. Just imagine and use power and you can have anything.</p><p>Well, that was utter BULLSHIT.</p><p>Sure, but that’s the same as saying the Sun is hot.</p><p>You don’t get an idea of exactly how hot it is until you study more.</p><p>Magic is still the force that drives the entire Devil Race in general. Even Low Class Devils are capable of magic and they know basic magic for their daily works.</p><p>The Profession Schools teach the people how to use magic suitable for their works too.</p><p>The main problem however is how to channel your magic.</p><p>Just like the wands of the Harry Potter world, Devils use Magic Circles as a focus. This enables them to easily call upon their Demonic Power as well as store some template spells.</p><p>Now, the Pillar Houses have Magic Circles refined for over a period of ten thousand years at the very minimum. Same is the case for the Satan Clans and Extra Demons.</p><p>The common folks like me however do not have this privilege.</p><p>We need to buy magic circles from the shops.</p><p>These circles are priced in terms of their efficiency which is normally 25% for a common one and 30-35% for a good Magic Circle which could take almost all the money that I currently have in my accounts and even then fail to make 10% of the price.</p><p>They are priced in literally hundreds of millions of Lilium, which is the currency of the Underworld’s Devil Race mainly.</p><p>Higher Ranked Magic circles are sold in auctions and they can have upto 40% efficiency.</p><p>The Pillar Devils are rumored to have Magic Circles which can achieve an efficiency of about 75% or above while Satan Houses are all above 85%.</p><p>Sure there are other ways to get better Magic Circles which is by becoming a servant to a High Class Pillar Devil and receive their version of the Servant’s Magic Circle which has about 50% efficiency or even better their Peerage Members and receive the same Magic Circle as the House members.</p><p>The last choice would be to make our own Magic Circles which requires the knowledge of Runes, Magical Theory, and many other things that are not available to anyone but High Class Devils for an insane price obviously. Hell, even Human Magicians are better off because they get offered a Magical Circle by their organization to make complex calculations and help them use their magic more proficiently. They even store some common spells inside them and those can be used as a quick slot.</p><p>The entire fucking system is rigged to keep the Low Class Devils suppressed and those in power to keep their positions.</p><p>It was one of the reasons I gave up learning magic as a priority right now because I didn’t have the resources for it so no point bothering my head. I did however make it a point to exhaust my Demonic Power every day to train my reserves. I may not have the knowledge for the spells but that doesn’t stop me from increasing my Magic Stat. I was taught some basic things by Aaron like basic Wind Magic.</p><p>Yes, Fire Magic is dangerous. Water Magic can make a mess. Earth Magic can be taxing. Wind Magic was the most proficient one to be taught to beginners as it doesn’t take too much power.</p><p>Now these basic spells were easy and they did work on the Imagination principle.</p><p>Just think about wind blowing and Will your Demonic Power to let that happen.</p><p>It was hard imagining everything to perfection, every fucking time because I didn’t have any Magic Circle to record the most efficient use.</p><p>The Mind Stat helped but not to the extent I wanted.</p><p>Reinforcement Magic was not recommended either because that needed knowledge of Devil Physiology. I didn’t have that.</p><p>So the most I could do was exhaust my Demonic Power by trying to make strong gusts of wind.</p><p>I did decrease my Magic Stat to around 12 for the process to be over soon. It did gain me a single point for every time I recovered.</p><p>There was also a slight passive increase in my Magic Stat from natural growth and another one due to my increased Spirit Stat and the training using ‘his’ name.</p><p>I plan to get a Magic Circle for myself when I complete my primary education and start on a Professional Class.</p><p>For now I could only grind in silence.</p><p><strong>- Interlude –</strong></p><p><strong>- Grayfia Lucifuge –</strong></p><p>“Was there any news about the Fallen attackers, Ingvild?” she asked, watching her bishop tending to the garden. Ingvild had always been the kind and peaceful one.</p><p>It sometimes pained her to even involve such a child in the politics of the Underworld but she didn’t have a choice. It was for both their safety.</p><p>The old bastards from the Great King Faction would eat her up and then have her have an accident or fall into sleeping sickness after they get a child out of her.</p><p>It was not as if she didn’t stop such a plan from happening once already.</p><p>“No. They had returned back to the Fallen Territory. We couldn’t give chase there.” She shook her head. “They killed everyone there, everyone except an eight year old. This child survived because his parents had covered him with their own bodies and he fainted during the attack. The Fallen might have assumed him to have died because of the blood and no movement and thus left the child alone.”</p><p>Grayfia slightly grimaced on hearing the news. She however quickly pushed her thoughts aside and asked her next question. “The child. Did he identify anyone? We could use the testimony to put pressure on Azazel to hand over the criminals.”</p><p>She observed Ingvild wince slightly. “He….he had lost his memories.”</p><p>Grayfia frowned. “Memory manipulation? Not likely. They would have killed the child if they had the opportunity, why wipe the memory? Injuries?”</p><p>“He….woke up bathed in the blood of his own parents. The child was in a traumatic state and according to the doctor, his brain just locked away the memories to protect him. The doctor said that any attempts to force it open will lead to his Demonic Power acting violently in self-defense and might possibly render the child brain-dead. He was….” she stared off into the distance and Grayfia didn’t ask her anything about it but gave her time to collect herself. “He had no one left. Not even neighbours. He didn’t recall anything except his name. Not even his parent’s name. Nothing. I….”</p><p>Grayfia sat beside her and caressed her hair, pulling her into her side.</p><p>“I apologized to him but….instead he thanked….thanked me for saving his life. I felt so disgusted at myself at that moment. A child was reassuring me.” She breathed in deeply and continued. “He….reminded me of myself when you saved me back then. He has purple hair and the same coloured eyes.”</p><p>Grayfia tightened her grip on her. She did remember how she had found her years ago. Her mother had passed away, hunted by her own family when she had refused to participate in the war and had married a human. Her father had covered for her but was still killed by the Fallen Angels who had discovered her whereabouts.</p><p>She had come upon a traumatized child by chance when her other bishop had investigated the Fallen attack there.</p><p>She continued, “I couldn’t do it, Grayfia. I couldn’t face him. If he had shouted at me for failing him, it might have been better. But the child didn’t have that ability. He….” She gulped down a lump in her throat and continued, “He had nowhere to go, so I gave him a place in the servant’s quarters in the mansion till he is old enough and instructed Berta to look after him. It was the least I could do after all.”</p><p>“You did the right thing.”</p><p>Grayfia might have lost faith in men, but that was a child and she understood why Ingvild would help him.</p><p>“Don’t worry. I will send the others to hunt for the Fallen who did this. I will not let them escape.”</p><p>With that said, she caressed the girl who she had come to see like a little sister till she soon fell asleep in her arms slowly.</p><p>She then proceeded to take her to the bed and let her rest in peace.</p><p>She had noticed that Ingvild didn’t seem to be herself when she had returned. This was why she had taken to asking what had happened this time or cases like these that happened once in a decade normally. It wouldn’t have been the first time.</p><p>“I hope you heard about that?” She questioned when she returned to her living room.</p><p>“Yes, My Lady.”</p><p>“Investigate. I want those Fallen beheaded and their heads impaled on pikes around that Village as retribution.” She ordered coldly.</p><p>“As you command. My Lady….”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>“What of the boy?” the blue haired woman asked, coming out of the shadows.</p><p>Grayfia thought about it for a moment. The last time the Great King Faction had tried an attempt to drug Ingvild, it had been through a maid she had hired. A young girl of fourteen. She wouldn’t put it past those bastards to push an even younger child. It might be very suspicious of her but then again when dealing with such people, one can never be more careful. She finally decided on the course of action. “Observe the boy. Order Berta to not allow him inside the mansion. If he is not safe, make sure he disappears in an accident. Ingvild was greatly hurt when the maid was found guilty. That scenario is better off being avoided.”</p><p>“Yes, My Lady. But what if he is safe?” she asked with a bit of mirth in her tone.</p><p>“Then let him be. Ingvild promised him protection. He will be protected.” With that said, Lady Lucifuge went towards her room leaving her other bishop alone.</p><p>The one who was the center of the topic was sleeping peacefully at this moment.</p><p>_________________________________x__________________________________________________________________x_________________________________</p><p><strong>Beta Reader: LuluViBritania(FF.N, SB and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><strong>This was a sudden inspiration I had to write about how the Low Class Devils live and their struggles in the Underworld when I was deciding on the Magic System of the Devil Race for ‘Deal with the Devil’.</strong></p><p><strong>A Low Class Devil growing up and becoming something would be a new take.</strong></p><p><strong>Also I was asked why I don’t use Grayfia in my stories and instead make her doubles every time so I decided to just mess up the whole DxD world and make a new one.

I’m fine. As you saw already, they didn’t let me fight. I only used my Innate Technique once.” I replied.</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is quite wonderful. Her soul was not hurt in the least. Your technique is even more mysterious than I had expected.”</p><p><br></p><p>Kisuke-san spoke while he was using spells on her to check but quickly jumped back as an Ice Statue appeared in front of him.</p><p><br></p><p>I sensed danger so I quickly used the power of The Restaurant to dispel it.</p><p><br></p><p>“Was it her poke….notPokemon….ughh, whatever it was?” Rimuru asked as he peeked from behind us.</p><p><br></p><p>“It would seem so. That thing is tied to her soul….quite similar to a Zanpakuto and yet completely different. It must have sensed the spells and come out to protect its owner.” He finished his check and got up. “Yes. She will be fine after some rest. The possession just took some toll on her and she is exhausted.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What about the woman who possessed her?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, she was thrown back to her own body when you did….what did you do again?” Rimuru asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Jujutsu. I am learning Jujutsu. So what happened to her? Was she really?” I asked, getting back to the topic.</p><p><br></p><p>“She and her associates will not be disturbing you any longer.” Zeref-san answered.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh….” Was all I could say.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the blonde girl laying on one of the couches in worry.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry. It was just a small possession.” Ainz patted my shoulder.</p><p><br></p><p>“Which you all could have stopped. Why were you even watching her do what she wanted? It could have been dangerous, you know.” I reprimanded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Silas.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am an Overlord, the highest possible class one can gain which deals with Possessions, Souls and Necromancy. Possessions of such level….I could fix with a snap of my finger. What we wanted to see is the means and abilities of magicians of your world to get more information. Only by knowing your enemy, can you prepare for them. We didn’t interfere because there was no danger to begin with.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That....makes sense.” I agreed. Thinking of something, I looked at Sakura. “Sakura.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.” The girl who had been silent.</p><p><br></p><p>“Can you please take care of this girl? I will go and see what the others are doing.”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>With that said, we walked near the entrance of the Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>“Anyways, what about them?” Ainz asked, looking back at Tobio and his group who were with the children. “From what I found out, they work for the Fallen Angels, who are enemies of devils. They could be dangerous.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Tobio is a friend. He wouldn’t do such a thing.” I replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“But others might.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I can just beat them up if they come to cause any trouble.” Tohru said, patting her chest.</p><p><br></p><p>I was thinking about what to do when Zeref-san suggested something.</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t know how memory manipulation might work on people of different worlds and if others have a way to undo those so why don’t we just make them take an oath, a contract of sorts that they will not reveal anything about you or this Restaurant?”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s….you can do that?” I asked. In jujutsu there was something called the Binding Vow but I had no idea how to use those yet.</p><p><br></p><p>“It should be quite easy but first we need to do something about the surroundings. We need to fix the area first and then hide this Restaurant and then we can think what to do with the children.” Zeref-san said.</p><p><br></p><p>With the plans made, everyone got to work.</p><p><br></p><p>The most amazing among them was Rimuru. He created a whirlpool in his hand and swallowed everything inside and with his other hand, started throwing out fixed things. He quickly fixed the area of damage removing all the signs of a fight having taken place. It was absolutely incredible to see him work like that.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy was literally laying out roads by just sliding on them and fixing broken buildings the same way.</p><p><br></p><p>Meanwhile, the rest transferred the healed kids to the nearby park.</p><p><br></p><p>“We should just end them to avoid potential trouble.” Irene, the woman with Zeref-san said and I saw the blonde girl who had come to fetch Tobio pale in fright.</p><p><br></p><p>“She is not wrong, boss.” Tohru said, cracking her knuckles as her tail and horns appeared for the two to see.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, stop scaring them. Just let them sign the contracts. They won’t tell anyone. I believe them.”</p><p><br></p><p>The girl nodded profusely at my statement.</p><p><br></p><p>I noticed a ghost of a smirk on Irene’s face as she signed the papers. I guess she is not that bad of a person after all.</p><p><br></p><p>The neighbours were not a problem as Kisuke-san had apparently put them all to sleep using some kind of magic at the start.</p><p><br></p><p>Ainz still used some kind of item to do something I don’t know about. He just reassured me that no people were harmed in the act.</p><p><br></p><p>I took this opportunity to thank the people who helped out. “Thank you, Cid-kun.”</p><p><br></p><p>The guy just stared at me and repeated. “As I have already told you, I am Shadow, he who lives in the shadows to hunt the shadows.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“....oh. Shadow-kun then. Thank you for helping me out today. Please visit us again. I would treat you to the best meal I can make.” I bowed slightly.</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded and left quickly without any more words.</p><p><br></p><p>At this point, both of us knew and were just playing along.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean, which kid hasn’t thought of being a superhero at this age. I looked at Ainz and Rimuru….and maybe adults too.</p><p><br></p><p>Let him enjoy.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, with everything done, we got down to some questioning. And boy can Ainz play the bad cop.</p><p><br></p><p>The kids were apparently new with this too, well apart from the Lavinia girl who was sleeping. We were still able to get some information from them.</p><p><br></p><p>There are a bunch of supernatural factions in this world. They mostly hide from normal humans. When any such incident is found out, they erase the information and wipe the minds of those involved.</p><p><br></p><p>It was fucking MIB out there.</p><p><br></p><p>I guess that explains why I had no idea about them for so long.</p><p><br></p><p>The area I was staying in was a neutral ground of sorts .</p><p><br></p><p>Kyoto was ruled by the Youkai, the Eastern Youkai faction to be exact.</p><p><br></p><p>The other side was ruled by the Five Principal Clans, who were basically the top Onmyoji of the country.</p><p><br></p><p>This town was ownerless simply because it was used as a buffer zone between the two factions.</p><p><br></p><p>The main factions in Japan were the Shinto Gods, Youkai and the Onmyoji Clans, mainly the Five Principal Clans. The Youkai also had several other factions within them.</p><p><br></p><p>There were also the occasional members of the Abrahamic factions which were Angels, Devils and the Fallen Angels. I’m a Devil, a member of the race created by fucking Lucifer when he rebelled from heaven.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. Apparently, in this world Lucifer created a fucking race and other angels who were kicked out of Heaven became Fallen Angels instead of Devils.</p><p><br></p><p>Why I was here was not revealed from the information. But I couldn’t think of any good reasons for it.</p><p><br></p><p>Eh, who cares. I got a good life. I have no complaints about the family I got here. My parents, who were most-likely not my birth parents, treated me so well that I didn’t even know I was adopted. Why would I have a problem with them?</p><p><br></p><p>As for conspiracy theories about them using me or what not, since there was no way of finding that out anymore, I’d rather not sully the memories of my parents with such thoughts.</p><p><br></p><p>A glass can be half empty or half full depending on a user’s perspective. Not appreciating the fact that you have half a glass of something when many others don’t even have that privilege is childish. This is the principle I have lived with. If something cannot be changed, there is no use bitching about it and making your life a pity party.</p><p><br></p><p>Anyways, not straying from the topic at hand.</p><p><br></p><p>They decided to leave the shop while Lavinia rested on the upper floor. She will be allowed to leave when she decides to sign the contract or her memories will be wiped. Sakura was taking care of her at the moment.</p><p><br></p><p>Tobio thanked us before going. He was quite a polite guy.</p><p><br></p><p>Touma also left quickly as he was getting late.</p><p><br></p><p>We knew that the Supernatural police would be out here in a while so we decided on a plan.</p><p><br></p><p>As we didn’t know if they would recognise other magicians or supernatural beings I closed the restaurant and we had Saitama man the shop while the more <em>noticeable</em> members decided to leave for their worlds. I was welcomed by some of them to visit while the heat faded away.</p><p><br></p><p>“I would have invited you but I still don’t know anything about the world I have been teleported to so….” Ainz said.</p><p><br></p><p>“You can come with me. The goblins and dwarves in my village are quite friendly.” Rimuru offered.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are always invited to my place too.” Kisuke-san said and I politely rejected.</p><p><br></p><p>“I think you should come to have a look at our world. You have a demon seed now so you might even learn magic suitable for you. It will help you in such situations. We can check your aptitude for different kinds of magic too. From what you have told me, you already know Curse Magic. Even in my world, Demons have great affinity for Curse Magic. Maybe you can find something for your use there.”</p><p><br></p><p>Even Tohru wanted to offer but she was afraid that other dragons would attack me at first sight.</p><p><br></p><p>They looked at me and I thought for a while.</p><p><br></p><p>I finally decided to take Rimuru’s offer as I had just reunited after a long time.</p><p><br></p><p>“I can do something about magic too, you know. I have some magicians and from what I have heard, there are demons and demon lords in my world too and apparently people get summoned in my world often and get magic and skills when they do so. I have also heard that sometimes, otherworlders just walk into the world and even then they get skills suitable for them. We can try to see if you get something.” Rimuru offered a suggestion.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! And is this power gain almost instant?” Ainz asked, suddenly interested.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, there are things like naming someone which can give them power. The goblins working under me all evolved into Hobgoblins when I named them and gained a lot of power. Since Silas is not a human, we can try and see if that works.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s interesting.” Ainz scratched his jaw.</p><p><br></p><p>“What kind of skills are we talking about?” Kisuke-san asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“It depends on the personality and affinity of the user. It could be anything, from being good at Gardening to being able to cut space and harm True Dragons.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>That’s scary.</p><p><br></p><p>Also True Dragons?</p><p><br></p><p>Where did that come from?</p><p><br></p><p>Somehow I had a feeling that he was very specific about the example.</p><p><br></p><p>“Merging the Demon Seed by learning magic from our world would be wiser.” Irene said before adding. “Although, having a stronger base to work with never hurts.”</p><p><br></p><p>With that decided, I went to Rimuru’s world.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is this a….” I looked around the hut.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah….we are still in the process of construction. The Dwarves are very good but there are only five of them.”</p><p><br></p><p>We walked out as he explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s….beautiful.” I whispered as I looked at the scenery outside.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru’s world was….was untainted.</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah, that’s the word I was looking for.</p><p><br></p><p>No pollution, no hustle and bustle of the city. The air was so fresh.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked around and saw many, were those the goblins Rimuru was talking about.</p><p><br></p><p>He must have noticed my gaze so he explained. “These are Hobgoblins and Goblins. Those at the back are the Star Wolves. Kajin-san and the others are working on the buildings over there.” He pointed towards an incomplete house in the distance.</p><p><br></p><p>While I was looking at them, even they were looking at me curiously.</p><p><br></p><p>“Everyone! This is one of my best friends, Silas. He will often be coming here so you guys should not be surprised.”</p><p><br></p><p>The hobgoblins and goblinas all knelt immediately. Even the Star Wolves behind them knelt.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Rimuru in surprise. “This is….”</p><p><br></p><p>The guy let out a sigh. “They are very traditional.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Hah.”</p><p><br></p><p>The monsters of the city were quite friendly and interesting. Especially the goblin called Gobuta.</p><p><br></p><p>He was funny.</p><p><br></p><p>They brought food for us. It was mostly roasted meat and fruits.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the lot and thought of something. “Know what? Let me cook for you all today.”</p><p><br></p><p>“N-no, Silas-sama. How can we make you work?” Rigurd denied immediately.</p><p><br></p><p>“I think it’s an amazing idea. Silas is a great cook.” Rimuru quickly spoke up and after some convincing they prepared more materials while Rimuru prepared the grill.</p><p><br></p><p>While cooking, I taught the Goblinas how to prepare the recipes and gave them some tips.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, after a hearty meal, both Rimuru and I laid on the roof of one of the houses and looked at the stars.</p><p><br></p><p>“You can’t see such a starry sky in Kyoto.” He said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeah. Neither in Tokyo.” I agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright!” He jumped up. “Let’s get to this. Since you didn’t get any skills by just walking inside, let’s try something else.” He looked at me. “I name you, Silas.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh….” Was all I could say when my eyes widened.</p><p><br></p><p>Power surged from inside me, rapidly increasing with every moment and before I could say anything, the world went dark around me.</p><p><br></p><p>In that world of darkness, I could not see or hear anything.</p><p><br></p><p>At this moment, a thought struck me. Wish.</p><p><br></p><p>Hmm.</p><p><br></p><p>My wish?</p><p><br></p><p>What do I wish for?</p><p><br></p><p>Hmm, maybe to be able to run my restaurant better. I guess, be a better chef.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Unique Skill Gained: Chef.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p>I might be a Devil but I don’t want to become a heartless monster. Zeref explained that for normal humans, the Demon Seed could change someone’s personality….but I don’t want to be controlled by it. I don’t want to become someone else. I want to be me.</p><p><br></p><p>I want someone to keep me sane, from losing my sanity, someone wise….</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Extra Skill Gained: Sage.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p>And with this, I lost my consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Intrinsic Skill: Magic Manipulation Gained</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Intrinsic Skill: Universal Speak Gained</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Intrinsic Skill: Water Manipulation Gained</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Intrinsic Skill: Ice Manipulation Gained</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Intrinsic Skill: Material Creation Gained</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Intrinsic Skill: Magic Resistance Gained</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Intrinsic Skill: Possession Gained</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Intrinsic Skill: Charm Gained</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Intrinsic Skill: Shapeshifting Gained</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Extra Skill: Demonic Core Gained.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Rimuru -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He watched as Silas lost consciousness. It was only the reassurance of Great Sage which kept him calm now.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a miracle that he was able to connect to his friends. He would never be able to look himself in a mirror if he actually fucked up the life of a friend now.</p><p><br></p><p><em>‘The Individual Silas has gained a Unique Skill called Chef.’</em></p><p><br></p><p>Chef? Yeah, it was the Skill Silas would get. Silas cooked the best darned food he had ever tasted in his life.</p><p><br></p><p>If someone else got the Chef Skill other than Silas, Rimuru would have an objection.</p><p><br></p><p>What does the Skill do?</p><p><br></p><p>Unique Skill Chef has several sub Skills.</p><p><br></p><p><em>‘First is Analysis. It allows the user to analyse anything he sees or touches, be it Material, Magic or any Skill of any kind.’</em></p><p><br></p><p>So, a bit similar to Great Sage.</p><p><br></p><p>Then again he guessed, a Chef needed to know the ingredients to cook better food.</p><p><br></p><p><em>‘Second is Outcome Alteration. It allows the user to overwrite the nature and fate of an object, being or even laws and alter them to his wishes. Even if one tries to oppose the user, the user will just overwrite it with a stronger wish. This skill is given absolute priority and must achieve the desired effects of the user. Only those who possess a similar skill can oppose the user. The possible drawback is the extreme consumption of magicules for using this skill. The consumption of magicules for the skill depends on the extent of the change the user intends to make. He would also need physical contact to use this part of the ability.’</em></p><p><br></p><p>So Silas would need a lot more magicules than he currently has to comfortably use this skill.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is there a way I can make him stronger?” He asked Great Sage.</p><p><br></p><p><em>‘Great Sage suggests intense magical training and being named by another being of great power.’</em></p><p><br></p><p>“Named? We can name people more than once?”</p><p><br></p><p><em>‘Each successive use takes more Magicules.’</em></p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Can I name him again?”</p><p><br></p><p><em>‘Currently you are not strong enough to name him.’</em></p><p><br></p><p>“Ughh. I guess we need to get him trained in the next few days, enough to be able to defend himself in case he ever encounters people like those.”</p><p><br></p><p><em>‘The Analysis of the Magic, Spriggan Law has been completed.’</em></p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>What?</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Unnamed Onmyoji -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He looked at his subordinates hanging from the ceiling by water snakes.</p><p><br></p><p>Most of them had lost their consciousness while some were barely holding on and would pass out soon, his own younger brother and son being among them. He then turned to look at the cause of it all who was not even sweating as he stood in front of him.</p><p><br></p><p>“You will not get away with this. The Utsusemi Agency will find you. They will take revenge. We will….”</p><p><br></p><p>The devil snapped a finger and one of his subordinates exploded, putting a stop to his triad all of a sudden.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked in shock.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mitsuru….Mitsuru!” He roared and a second later the water snake covered his head completely, drowning his voice in the gurgling noise.</p><p><br></p><p>The water snake moved away after almost a minute as he gasped for breath, repeatedly coughing to expel the water he had swallowed.</p><p><br></p><p>At this time, the devil spoke, his voice containing barely suppressed rage and madness. “I have said this to others and I will say this for the first and last time….I am at the end of my patience. Do <em>not</em> test me. For every time you lie, one person in this group will die. For every minute of my time you waste, I will randomly kill one person from this group.”</p><p><br></p><p>His eyes widened in horror at the devil’s words.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why! Why are you doing this! We never did anything to you!” He roared.</p><p><br></p><p>BOOM!</p><p><br></p><p>Another body hanging from the air exploded.</p><p><br></p><p>“What did I say about testing my patience? Let’s add another rule. Every time you speak any unnecessary drivel, another person dies.” </p><p><br></p><p>The water snake circled over the head of his son and his eyes widened in fear.</p><p><br></p><p>“No….No, please not him. Not my son.” He begged.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Son?” The devil asked softly before taking another look behind him. “I see. Yes….this is fitting. This is fitting indeed.” He murmured to himself before looking towards him. “Very well. You know the rules already so I will begin asking. First questions first, are you Yuiichi Domon?”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>There were no changes in the expression of the devil as he just stared at him coldly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Where is Hanezu Himejima?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Out….he is out on a mission to….to capture some kids with Sacred Gears and test the….the Utsusemi we produced in collaboration with the Wizards of Oz.” He quickly answered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Will he come back to this place?”</p><p><br></p><p>“N-no. He stays in the main base and only comes here on wednesdays.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Where is the main base?”</p><p><br></p><p>He quickly gave the location of the base up, fearing the consequences.</p><p><br></p><p>“Three months and two weeks ago, did you kill the Evans family, the Restaurant owners from Tokyo for their house?” It asked suddenly.</p><p><br></p><p>“The Evans Family….” He asked, stunned.</p><p><br></p><p>The water snake on top of his son’s head moved slightly.</p><p><br></p><p>“No, don’t. Yes. Yes I did that.” He quickly answered. “They have nothing to do with it. Please….please let them go.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Who ordered you to kill them?”</p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://“Hanezu….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">“Hanezu….it</a> was Hanezu Himejima. They wanted the location for the Leylines under it to conduct rituals. I….”</p><p><br></p><p>The devil however had no change in his expressions.</p><p><br></p><p>“Who killed Rufus Beige, the magician who was with the Evans family.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We….we organised an ambush for the family when they were going out for some party. A team of people from both the Utsusemi Agency and Wizards of Oz ambushed them in between. They were killed without much resistance under the attacks of Augusta of the Purple Flame, the witch of the east of the Wizards of Oz.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Who were in the car at that moment?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The Evans couple and the magician.”</p><p><br></p><p>The devil paused for a bit all of a sudden.</p><p><br></p><p>“Was there no one else in the car?”</p><p><br></p><p>He desperately shook his head. “No. No there was no one else?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Very well. Then answer me one last question….the son of the Evans family….where is Silas Evans?”</p><p><br></p><p>He opened his mouth and was about to say when suddenly a wall of black light passed over him and he was drowned in neverending darkness.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Azazel -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“And you are saying that when you woke up, you found yourselves with the children, in the middle of the park?”</p><p><br></p><p>The two kids didn’t meet his eyes but nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>They were lying.</p><p><br></p><p>“And where is Lavinia?”</p><p><br></p><p>“She said she had something to do and will be arriving later.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see.” He stared at them again, observing them closely.</p><p><br></p><p>The sweat, tremor in their voices, their eyes….everything said only one thing- They were afraid.</p><p><br></p><p>They were even traumatised.</p><p><br></p><p>And Azazel could understand their situation.</p><p><br></p><p>That attack….Black Light….the Demonic Brilliance of Evil Light….that power belonged to only one being, his late brother Lucifer….</p><p><br></p><p>How did this involve a Lucifer? And more importantly, who was this Lucifer?</p><p><br></p><p>The attack had shaken everyone in the entire Japan.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe the only redeeming fact was that the attack was too fast and no one exactly saw it or it would have been nigh impossible to clear the mess.</p><p><br></p><p>Even now, his people as well as the Principal Clan members were running around doing damage control.</p><p><br></p><p>He was pretty sure he would be getting a call from Serafall and Michael any moment.</p><p><br></p><p>“Anything else to explain?” He asked the two kids.</p><p><br></p><p>Natsume seemed as if she was trying to say something but no words came out.</p><p><br></p><p>He resisted narrowing his eyes and cast a spell, confirming that they were under some kind of spell which prevented them from saying anything.</p><p><br></p><p>In such cases, it was better to not force them lest it triggers the spell.</p><p><br></p><p>Still….a Lucifer. Something like this was not what he was expecting from a Lucifer. Any member of that family would have killed the kids without any hesitation.</p><p><br></p><p>Not to mention, them keeping quiet for such a long time and only being found out when those fools stepped directly in front of him with the Incinerate Anthem of all things.</p><p><br></p><p>And Augusta paid a price for it….</p><p><br></p><p>Sigh….</p><p><br></p><p>“Very well. You all can go and take some rest. We will begin your training tomorrow.”</p><p><br></p><p>They nodded and quietly left.</p><p><br></p><p>He closed his eyes and massaged his head.</p><p><br></p><p>At this moment, there was a knock on the door and Shemhazai entered with a shocked face. He directly handed him a tablet without any words.</p><p><br></p><p>He raised an eyebrow and looked at the tablet, noticing some cracks at the corner of the screen.</p><p><br></p><p>Slowly he read the report and a cracking sound appeared. He had unconsciously broken the tablet. But he didn’t have the time to worry about it.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at Shemhazai in equal shock. “Is this a joke?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do I look like I am joking?” Shemhazai replied back.</p><p><br></p><p>“But that’s impossible.”</p><p><br></p><p>“These are just the preliminary reports. We need to investigate more to find out the detailed information.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then find it. Send more people if you have to.” He ordered. </p><p><br></p><p>“Azazel, do you think it was a result of that attack?”</p><p><br></p><p>“.... I don't know. I really don't know.”</p><p><br></p><p>They kept quiet for a while. </p><p><br></p><p>Shemhazai broke the silence again.</p><p><br></p><p>“What about the kids? Did they know anything?”</p><p><br></p><p>“They do….but they are under some kind of spell which prevents them from speaking.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A spell? Why would someone from<em> that</em> family use spells?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I have no idea but….don’t push them. Do keep an eye on them though. I guess it explains why they were terrified. Anyways, until all reports are verified,make sure our people don't go into that area.”</p><p><br></p><p>Shemhazai nodded.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Silas -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I opened my eyes to see an unfamiliar roof above my head.</p><p><br></p><p>A moment later things came rushing into my mind as I looked around.</p><p><br></p><p>Ah. Mikam….Rimuru’s house.</p><p><br></p><p>What happened to me?</p><p><br></p><p>I got up and heard a sound beside me. Looking at the source of the sound, I saw a Goblina staring at me.</p><p><br></p><p>She bowed and ran out of the room, leaving me confused.</p><p><br></p><p>I got down from the bed and looked at myself.</p><p><br></p><p>My body looked the same, only much more toned and stronger than before.</p><p><br></p><p>It reminded me of the scene from Captain America where Steve Rogers transforms into the superhero form. I mean, I was fucking ripped.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at myself in the mirror. My looks were practically the same, only more defined. I had a slightly baby face, black hair and purple eyes. None of that changed, except now, I looked much sharper. I basically went from the cute type to the cool type.</p><p><br></p><p>My power was surging like never before. My cursed energy was several times higher. It was on a level where I could easily surpass Naruto, although not even close to Sakura.</p><p><br></p><p>I raised my hand in front of me and water gathered from around and formed a water ball and then with just a thought, it froze, forming a ball of ice. With a slight twist of my finger, the ball of ice was moulded into a bunch of ice needles.</p><p><br></p><p>“Already playing with the magic, I see.” I heard Rimuru’s voice and looked at him standing on the door.</p><p><br></p><p>“What happened? Why did I lose consciousness? And how long was I out for?” I asked, still looking at the ice needles which were floating above my hand.</p><p><br></p><p>“You were getting the skills from the voice of the world, basically the power which regulates this world or something. As for how long you were out for, around eight hours. Anyways, how are you feeling? Any discomfort? Did you check the skills?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I….am getting the hang of it. Still haven’t checked the others.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Take your time. Your power has risen a lot compared to what it was although you will need to practise them more often to get used to them. I will get Ainz and we can go out on hunts to get you used to your power later on.” Rimuru offered. He then went on to explain my skills to me in brief.</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded. “I need to get back to the Restaurant. Saitama must be waiting.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yup. Although I think he must be taking a nap more than anything else.”</p><p><br></p><p>“....yeah. That does sound like him.”</p><p><br></p><p>We chuckled and got ready to go back to the Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>“Rimuru.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha don’t mind it. Don’t mind it. We are friends, aren’t we? This is what friends do.”</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled. “Yes. Yes we are.”</p><p><br></p><p>The door to the Restaurant was in the same house in a different room which everyone was forbidden from entering.</p><p><br></p><p>I opened the door to the Restaurant and Saitama was playing games in his usual seat.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh Silas, Rimuru, you’re back.” He looked up and asked before delving back to the game.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru also joined him.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will go and check on Sakura and then make something for everyone.”</p><p><br>“Thanks.” They both shouted, already busy with the game.</p><p><br></p><p>I shook my head and went upstairs.</p><p><br></p><p>Sakura seemed to have heard our voices and came out of the room.</p><p><br></p><p>“Silas-san. You are back.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded. “Was everything alright here? No one troubled you all, did they?”</p><p><br></p><p>She shook her head. “No. I was up here for most of the time and Saitama-san was in the shop but I didn’t hear anything from here.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Good then. It’s already morning. Did the girl, Lavinia was it, did she wake up?”</p><p><br></p><p>She shook her head. “No. She is still asleep.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Kisuke-san said she needed some rest so let her. Poor girl went through a lot yesterday. I will go and cook something for everyone.”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded. “Will you be opening the Restaurant today?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Gojo-sensei said he was going to bring some people today.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay. I will prepare then.” She nodded and was about to walk when I stopped her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sakura.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>She smiled and nodded her head.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I laid the last plate on the table as we sat down to eat.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did someone come last night after we left?” I asked Saitama.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. Oh yeah. There was one guy. What was his name again? Doorman Savana....Shirt and Pajama....ah....Milk and Banana!”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?” All three of us looked at Saitama.</p><p><br></p><p>There was no way someone was called that.</p><p><br></p><p>Were they pulling some kind of prank on Saitama?</p><p><br></p><p>….he does look like the kind of guy who would fall for something like that.</p><p><br></p><p>“He looked like a weirdo though. He asked me about the owner. I told him I was the owner as you had asked me to. He destroyed my shirt and tried to attack me so I punched him out.”</p><p><br></p><p>“He attacked you?” I asked, narrowing my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“A weirdo?” Rimuru asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you fine? Did you get hurt?” I asked quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nah, I’m fine. He was weak. Don’t worry. I think he was here to rob the shop or something. Seriously, they should just go and work hard.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A robber….seriously….yesterday was wild. Then again, a simple mugger was almost cute after facing the pokemon kids and those crazy magicians.” Rimuru nodded and we continued eating food.</p><p><br></p><p>True.</p><p><br></p><p>“So what did you guys do in Rimuru’s world?” Saitama asked and we told him about his world. After eating, I went to prepare for the day and Rimuru went out to oversee the work of his people.</p><p><br></p><p>He did tell me to contact him immediately if there was any danger.</p><p><br></p><p>Saitama had stayed at the shop quite late today so he also went back early and things became quiet once more.</p><p><br></p><p>Half an hour later, Tohru was the first one to arrive.</p><p><br></p><p>“Boss! Did anyone come to disturb you again?” She asked, as soon as she entered.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. I was fine. Rimuru’s place was good.”</p><p><br></p><p>She came near me and smelled me. “Boss. Did you get stronger?” She asked, eying me curiously.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah yeah. Rimuru’s method worked out.” I raised my hand and showed her my new magic. “I even learned some magic.” I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! Water Magic. So cool. Now you can put out any accidental fires I make without any fire extinguishers.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t make fires in the first place.” I deadpanned.</p><p><br></p><p>I told her about Rimuru’s place.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh, goblins? I remember them. They are quite weak. The dwarves are tricky though. Most of them are weak but they can make dangerous weapons and armour.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I think Rimuru had Hobgoblins though. They evolved after he named them.”</p><p><br></p><p>As we were discussing this, the door opened and Miu and Naruto came with Hayato-san and the rest of the masters of Ryozanpaku.</p><p><br></p><p>They were told that Gojo-san will be bringing some of the students and they wanted to meet them too.</p><p><br></p><p>Minutes later both Touma and Cid-kun came as well.</p><p><br></p><p>I had prepared their bento for them already.</p><p><br></p><p>They checked on us and then left for school.</p><p><br></p><p>It was another half an hour later that the door opened once more.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yo Silas-kun, Sakura-chan, Naruto-kun. Did you miss me?” Gojo-san came in. Behind him, Nanami-sensei and Shoko-san came in followed by several others dressed in school uniforms. I only recognised the brown haired girl among them. I think her name was Nobara or something.</p><p><br></p><p>Other students were different.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a huge guy with the side of his face burned and there was a girl too who had a large part of her face and body with burn scars. Then again, they did tell me that being a Jujutsu Sorcerer was a dangerous job. It was the last guy who made me do a takeback.</p><p><br></p><p>Is that a panda suit?</p><p><br></p><p>“Sensei, is this the place?” A pink haired guy at the head of the group asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“A Restaurant.” The guy in the panda suit spoke.</p><p><br></p><p>“The Panda talked!” Naruto jumped out of his seat and pointed a finger at him. “Miu Nee-chan, it talked.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sit down Naruto. He’s just wearing a panda suit.” Miu pulled him back while apologising. “I am sorry. Naruro can be a little overexcited.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah don’t mind it. By the way, I am not wearing a Panda suit. This is what I look like.” He….wait seriously?</p><p><br></p><p>Even Miu was taken aback by the information.</p><p><br></p><p>Well….I guess after seeing talking dragons, slimes and skeletons, this is not that weird.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is he the new student, Sensei?” Nobara asked. “Isn’t he a bit too young?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well yeah. Naruto-kun might be young but he has extremely high potential. If trained well then by the time he reaches your age, he might even be able to take me on hahahaha.” Gojo-san laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone was shocked by this and looked at the kid.</p><p><br></p><p>“On the other note, the girl over here is Sakura-chan and our chef Silas-kun is the last student.</p><p><br></p><p>They looked at us and I took this opportunity to welcome them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Welcome. Please have a seat. Will you all be ordering something?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes! I will have mochi and red bean cakes.” Gojo-san raised his hand excitedly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Udon for me.” Shoko-san ordered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ramen sounds good.” Nanami-sensei said.</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing them, others took seats and ordered as well and took a look at the menu.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are those horns and tails real?” The girl with the burns asked, pointing at Tohru who was currently serving Naruto his fifth bowl of ramen.</p><p><br></p><p>Naruto answered, although with his mouth full it barely made any sense so Sakura explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Tohru-san is a Dragon.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A dragon? Seriously?” The pink haired one asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmph, do you have any doubt?” Tohru glared, her claws and fangs enlarging.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tohru.” I called out and she was back to normal as she turned back.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yesss boss!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Take their order.” I ordered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Okayy!”</p><p><br></p><p>I prepared their orders and finally went and sat with them. They were already having a lot of fun.</p><p><br></p><p>Naruto especially seemed to get along with the other students.</p><p><br></p><p>Gojo-san, who had finished his meal, got up and clapped his hands. “Hai hai, everyone listen up. Today is the first gathering of the new Tokyo Jujutsu High’s students. First of all, I would like to welcome Naruto-kun, Silas-kun and Sakura-chan to our school as first year students. Everyone clap.”</p><p><br></p><p>Cheers and claps rang through the room.</p><p><br></p><p>“Great. Now let me introduce your senpai to you all.” He went on to introduce every student.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh and the last one is a student from Kyoto Jujutsu High but I guess he passed out so he is a Jujutsu Sorcerer now. Meet Aoi Todo-kun.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Since it is the first meeting of the students, you all can talk among yourselves and get to know each other. Oh, I know what. We can have some sparring matches too.”</p><p><br></p><p>Both Nanami-sensei and Shoko-san looked at him but didn’t say anything.</p><p><br></p><p>I suddenly remembered something.</p><p><br></p><p>“Actually, can I ask for your help, Shoko-san?”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked up. “Yes?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm you see….” I explained to her the incident from yesterday. “And that’s how she was injured. She is still sleeping upstairs. Kisuke-san said she was fine soulwise but could I trouble you for a second opinion?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure. I will take a look at her.” She nodded and Sakura-chan led her upstairs.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wow, that’s quite some adventure you had. Tell me about the students. They were chasing you with pokemons?”</p><p><br></p><p>“NotPokemons….or that’s what we decided to call them since we don’t know what they were. The attackers were not keen on talking.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Were they like curses?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, I don’t know. They didn’t seem like Curses. From what Tobio told me, they were planning to make Sacred Gears of some sort and experimented on the kids. The things they made….those were actually failures.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sacred Gears?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, apparently, the God of the Bible in this world made several artifacts and distributed them through a lottery at birth. Every human has a chance to get one at birth although the chance is exceptionally low and it can be anything, from X Ray goggles to God Killing weapons with the power to destroy entire countries. The reason they were after Tobio was because his Sacred Gear was one of the strongest ones in the world.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Wait….Gods? As in real Gods?” Nanami-sensei asked, stunned.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, apparently my world has all kinds of supernatural creatures, even real Gods. Amaterasu, Zeus, Shiva, everyone is real here.”</p><p><br></p><p>I saw their mouths wide open.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are joking right?” He asked, still incredulous.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. Not really. Even the Kyoto youkai are ruled by a Nine Tailed Fox named Yasaka, who is the leader of almost half the Youkai of Japan. Then there are the Five Principal Clans of onmyoji and all.”</p><p><br></p><p>They were curious but I didn’t know much about the world so I couldn’t tell them.</p><p><br></p><p>By that time Shoko-san and Sakura had come down too.</p><p><br></p><p>“The girl is fine. She will wake up in a while.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright alright, enough of these things. Let’s go out and start our first joint training session.” Gojo-san clapped.</p><p><br></p><p>The shop didn’t have much of a crowd by then so we went out.</p><p><br></p><p>Familiar walls appeared in front of us.</p><p><br></p><p>The barriers around the place seemed a lot stronger than before.</p><p><br></p><p>Gojo-san seemed to have noticed my look and confirmed. “The barriers were strengthened by the old fossil. It can take a lot more beating than before.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Fossil?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sigh….stop teaching them nonsense.” Nanami-sensei scolded and then looked at me and explained. “The barriers were created by the Tengen-sama. He is the head of the entire Japan’s Jujutsu world. He found out about the situation and offered to provide a place where you all could be trained without any worries.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I….see. Please send our thanks to him then.”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Anyways, Silas-kun, you wanted to train your new Innate Technique. The best way to do that will be during a fight. So….let’s pick an opponent for everyone. Naruto-kun will be fighting Panda-kun. Sakura-chan will be fighting Yuta-kun and finally Silas-kun will be fighting Todo-kun. Don’t worry about injuries. We can heal everyone up in a jiffy with Shoko here, so go wild.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Satoru Gojo -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He looked as the pairs took position.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sending Yuta-senpai and Aoi-san against them is a bit too much, don't you think sensei?” Yuji asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, yes. It might be a bit too much to send Yuta. As for Silas, I don’t know. He is still learning to use his powers and Aoi can push him towards it. In fact, he is one of the people who has the best chance against Silas. As for Panda and Naruto. I think they are suitable.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, I don’t think Yuta-senpai would go hard against Sakura-chan.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha keep on looking.”</p><p><br></p><p>The first match was between Panda and Naruto so he appeared in between the field.</p><p><br></p><p>“The rules are simple. The first one to give up, lose consciousness or get out of the boundary of the field loses.”</p><p><br></p><p>The two sides took on their positions.</p><p><br></p><p>He observed both of them.</p><p><br></p><p>Panda was the perfect match for Naruto in this case as he is not truly violent and would be able to take hits.</p><p><br></p><p>Naruto might look like a kid but he had a similar fighting style to Yuji and Todo. He would improve during a fight.</p><p><br></p><p>“Get ready…..Start.”</p><p><br></p><p>As soon as his words fell, a massive amount of Cursed Energy burst out of Naruto.</p><p><br></p><p>“Holy shit!” Yuji exclaimed.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s….impossible. Just how much power does this kid have?”</p><p><br></p><p>Naruto, completely unbothered by them, shouted. “Here I come, Panda-senpai.” he kicked the ground and dashed towards Panda who defended but was pushed back several steps simply due to the enormous amount of cursed energy behind the attack.</p><p><br></p><p>Panda regained his footing and returned the favour as he punched only for Naruto to dodge using his smaller physique as an advantage.</p><p><br></p><p>The fight continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, the kid is talented in martial arts. In just these few moves, I think I have noticed hints of Karate, Judo, Muay Thai and Wing Chun. Is he some kind of prodigy?” Maki asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Naruto’s adopted family has a martial arts dojo. All of them are world class Martial Arts Masters, the very top of their fields.” Nanami replied.</p><p><br></p><p>Naruto slid below Panda and at that moment, Golden Chains popped out of his back, binding Panda, making him unable to move anymore.</p><p><br></p><p>Panda tried his best to break the chains but as expected, they didn’t break.</p><p><br></p><p>He clapped his hands. “Alright. That’s match. The winner is Naruto.”</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone was silent at the result but this silence was soon broken by the winner.</p><p><br></p><p>“I won yatta! Did you see that Miu nee-chan, Gramps, I won dattebayo.” The kid cheered while releasing Panda from the golden chains.</p><p><br></p><p>Panda looked at himself in shock. “What was the chain? I….couldn’t use any Cursed Energy at all.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Those chains have the ability to seal Cursed Energy and even bypass Cursed Techniques. They are almost unbreakable, so once you are caught in them….it’s game over.” He explained while patting Naruto’s head. “Well done Naruto-kun. You waited for the perfect opportunity to trap Panda-kun and gain a victory in one fell swoop.”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy grinned at the compliment and walked towards his guardians.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright let’s get ready for the next match. Aoi-kun, get in. You will be fighting Silas.”</p><p><br></p><p>They went onto the field.</p><p><br></p><p>Aoi had a wide smile on his face as he threw aside his shirt and took his position.</p><p><br></p><p>“So….what kind of girl do you like?”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Interlude (Sukuna’s Isekai Adventures- Part 2) -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The ritual to empower this body was successful. In fact, it was too successful.</p><p><br></p><p>He had underestimated the potency of whatever that black mud was.</p><p><br></p><p>Initially, he was planning to use those to create his own body but found out that the mud was starting to corrupt even him.</p><p><br></p><p>Fortunately, the owner of this body and his annoying trait came in helpful.</p><p><br></p><p>He was absorbing the black mud’s power and in turn increasing his cursed energy while any damage and mental corruption was suffered by the boy’s soul.</p><p><br></p><p>Observing the body closer, he found that the body was slowly transforming into something which was neither a human nor a Cursed Spirit, kind of a Pseudo Cursed Spirit. He had to make sure to maintain the balance so that the boy doesn’t get devoured by the power which was a delicate task and consumed such a large amount of his time.</p><p><br></p><p>But it was all worth it.</p><p><br></p><p>With this much power, even if he was not at his peak power, he was still at least as strong as he could be with a dozen fingers. Now he needed the body to adjust for a few days to this power level before he could empower it again.</p><p><br></p><p>It had been difficult hiding from those pesky exorcists and mages in his weakened state but it was worth it.</p><p><br></p><p>This whole fiasco had given him a chance like none before. It would be a pity if things were easy.</p><p><br></p><p>He thought of a plan.</p><p><br></p><p>Satoru Gojo would not stay in the same place all the time so there was a chance that he could find his target alone.</p><p><br></p><p>First he would take over that Restaurant owner and then he would have free reign to explore any number of worlds in all of existence.</p><p><br></p><p>A grin appeared on his face at the thought.</p><p><br></p><p>He dodged the areas under the surveillance of those magus. He would make sure to kill them when he attained his goals to erase this humiliation.</p><p><br></p><p>Almost half an hour later, he reached the door to the Restaurant and knocked.</p><p><br></p><p>The door was opened by a bald man wearing an atrocious combination of clothes. The annoyance made him attack him instinctively, just for sullying his eyes with such a horrid scene.</p><p><br></p><p>But something unexpected happened.</p><p><br></p><p>Instead of the scene he was expecting, the man didn’t fall, chopped into two pieces. All his attack did was slash his shirt in two.</p><p><br></p><p>The man looked down at his shirt in surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh? Did a button come off? No. There is a large cut? Did a loose string get caught somewhere? Man that sucks. I had just gotten it fixed last week.”</p><p><br></p><p>Limitless?</p><p><br></p><p>Was it another member of that annoying man’s clan?</p><p><br></p><p>No….there was no hint of Cursed Energy. Then what was it?</p><p><br></p><p>“As expected, they would never leave such a place unguarded. Tell me, where is the owner of the place?” He asked with a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>“Owner? Silas is ou….I mean I am the owner.” He replied, his lie obvious.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hoh! The audacity to lie in front of me, Ryomen Sukuna? Do you think I cannot touch you?” He smiled and launched a Cleave.</p><p><br></p><p>The next second however, he fell to his knees due to losing almost all his Cursed Energy in that attack. It hit the man head-on and sent a shockwave flying everywhere but to his stunned surprise, just another cut appeared on his shirt.</p><p><br></p><p>“How….did you….” He breathed out.</p><p><br></p><p>The bald man narrowed his eyes. “Did you do this?”</p><p><br></p><p>He quickly jumped back, his body moving far slower for his liking due to the exhaustion of most of his Cursed Energy.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Even kids are becoming robbers nowadays. This place is really dangerous.” With that said, the bald man punched and he suddenly felt as if he was drowned in a pit of endless ice. The hair on the back of his neck stood up as he felt the world collapse around him at that very instant.</p><p><br></p><p>During his entire life, this was the first time he had truly felt the feeling of death.</p><p><br></p><p>Rage welled up in his mind but before he could do anything the attack hit and he was blown kilometers away, his body shattered, all bones in his body broken.</p><p><br></p><p>He was barely able to use Reversed Curse Technique to fix his internal organs to a state that he doesn’t die instantly, barely hanging on to his life.</p><p><br></p><p>As he lay there in pain and humiliation of his defeat, the only thought that went through his head was….just who was that man?</p><p><br></p><p>“Ha hahahaha hahahahaha I will remember it. I will remember it….and one day I will kill you.”</p><p><br></p><p>But even he knew that his current strength was not enough to do so. Maybe not even his full strength was good enough to catch up with that kind of power?</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully, he didn’t need to be restricted to his full strength in this world any longer.</p><p><br></p><p>He remembered something from the blabberings of the owner of this body.</p><p><br></p><p>“Shinji Matou….tell me more about this Holy Grail War.”</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am back with another chapter of ‘Isekai Restaurant’.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>So, a lot of things happened in this chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The attack was finally taken care of and Lavinia is sleeping.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Silas found out that the people around him are OP….and weird.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Also, Silas finally got named.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>As you might have noticed, I changed the skill slightly from the snippet version.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>He will increase the power and sub-abilities of his Skills later on when he evolves more.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The world is just finding out about the attack and when they discover the true extent and effect of the attack, more people are going to piss their pants.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Anyways, the Jujutsu High Students are here to play and Naruto already won a round for the new students.

The area looked nothing like before.</p><p><br></p><p>The entire place was surrounded by high walls. Talismans covered every inch of the wall and not a single empty place could be seen. It was as if it was some sort of a bunker. </p><p><br></p><p>Although the part which bothered me the most is that I couldn’t tell who exactly it was protecting, us….or the world.</p><p><br></p><p>I had heard that the number of curses had increased drastically in the area and that everyone was doing what they were to protect this area but I was not expecting something like this.</p><p><br></p><p>The most surprising thing was the large gym-like facility and the rooms surrounding the place.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, let’s go. Show me what you got.” Gojo-san asked me.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is all this?” I asked, looking around the place</p><p><br></p><p>“Just some quick fix for the damage done to the place last time. Now this place could take your practice without giving out.” He shrugged. “Alright, see follow me. Let’s see what you can do. See those dummies there, attack them with your new Cursed Technique.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked towards the place he was pointing and those were indeed dummies.</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s gooooo! Nii-san. Blow that dummy up.” Naruto cheered from behind me.</p><p><br></p><p>He was always excited about this.</p><p><br></p><p>Sakura was also watching quietly.</p><p><br></p><p>I drew the knife, the same I had used to fight.</p><p><br></p><p>This thing had changed back last night and Tohru hadn’t come today so I couldn’t ask her what exactly it was.</p><p><br></p><p>I took a deep breath and held it in front of me and concentrated on the dummies.</p><p><br></p><p>The shape didn’t change but I knew that I didn’t need it to change its shape. My technique could be used anyways.</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Chop</em>.” I swung my knife in a chopping motion and sure enough the dummy in front of me was cut in two.</p><p><br></p><p>I aimed towards the second dummy and made my next move “<em>Julienne</em>.”</p><p><br></p><p>The dummy fell to the ground, chopped into thinly sliced sticks.</p><p><br></p><p>With every swing of my knife, a dummy fell.</p><p><br></p><p>By the time I looked back everyone had different kinds of reactions.</p><p><br></p><p>Sakura was smiling.</p><p><br></p><p>Naruto had a starry look in his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Gojo-san had a wide smile on his face.</p><p><br></p><p>And Nanami-sensei….he was looking at me and the dummies alternatively with a shocked look.</p><p><br></p><p>“So all those are the names of your techniques? How many did you awaken?” Gojo-san asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh? Not really. I think I only have one technique. I basically consider the battlefield as a kitchen and the knife movements are the same ones that I use in my kitchen. Those are just the names of the cuts.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh. So your technique sends invisible cuts to anything in its path then?” He asked, walking up to the dummy and checking them. “Rare but not unseen. In fact, I know of someone who can do something like this too.” He touched the dummies and said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, I don’t really send any slashes….or at least I think so. Also I don’t cut anything per say.” I interrupted. I knew what my technique did. It was something which became evident to me when I was fighting last night.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe the only thing that was obscuring it all this time was the seal.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! Then what do you think it does?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It….I think it cuts only what I want to cut.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Excuse me?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It just cuts what I want to cut. For example, <em>Slice</em>.” I lifted my knife and waved it towards another dummy with an armour of some kind and the entire armour was cut in two and fell to both sides of the dummy.</p><p><br></p><p>There were no cuts, not even a scratch on the dummy itself.</p><p><br></p><p>I knew this because when I cut those monsters last night, I made sure not to harm the boys who were attached to the monsters.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why I was able to assure Tobio that I hadn’t hurt any one of them.</p><p><br></p><p>Gojo-san disappeared from his place and appeared near the armour dummy….which was currently without any armour.</p><p><br></p><p>“No marks. The dummy is completely unharmed. Alright, now for another test.” he stood up and faced me. “Attack me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well you heard me. Attack. Don’t worry, I’ll be fine.” He laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure?” I asked, hesitating a bit.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha it’s fine. After all, I am the strongest.”</p><p><br></p><p>The corner of my lips twitched a bit at the man’s shameless bragging.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright then, here you go. Slice.” I aimed, only wishing to cut off his skin. Not his body completely.</p><p><br></p><p>His face changed as he raised his head and pulled up his sleeves to show us a line of cut on his skin. He then looked at me. “Were you aiming for just my skin?”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded and he looked back at his wound again as it healed almost instantly. “Well, I take back what I said, Silas-kun. Your Cursed Technique is not rare….it’s absolutely one of a kind. Care to help me with a few more experiments?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh, okay.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, try it again. Try cutting me again.” he asked, opening his blindfold.</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm okay.” If the guy himself wanted to get cut, who was I to deny?</p><p><br></p><p>Nanami-sensei did tell me that he was a master of the Reverse Cursed Technique.</p><p><br></p><p>I waved my knife again and this time he disappeared from his place and appeared in another place.</p><p><br></p><p>He lifted his sleeve and this time there were no cuts.</p><p><br></p><p>“So your attack can be dodged. It’s not like a Domain. It does have a time lag. Does it travel through obstacles? Alright, keep it up till I tell you to stop.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded and began to swing my knife at a faster speed.</p><p><br></p><p>I was training in martial arts with the Ryozanpaku Masters and eating my special food everyday and….I was even a devil so my physical abilities were more than a normal person. Not to mention my knife skills which were a reward from my Restaurant System. I could make over fifty cuts every second with extreme precision.</p><p><br></p><p>And this guy was dodging my attacks, disappearing from one place to another.</p><p><br></p><p>Not to say that he was completely uncut, I could see a few cuts on him….or at least I think I did because they disappeared as soon as they appeared. </p><p><br></p><p>We stopped after five minutes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, that’s enough. So, I figured out your technique.” He lifted his hand and waved at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“It does travel in some way as the more distance I had from you, the more time it took for you to hit. The difference was not much, around a fiftieth of a second for a fifteen metres distance. Pretty fast I think but I think you could go faster when you use more Cursed Energy and your movements increased. We need to work on your attack speed and martial arts more so that you can use your ability to your fullest. I still want to check a few things if you are up for it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay.” I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>After one and a half hours of testing my new Innate Technique, we went back to my Restaurant and I learned some more things about my technique.</p><p><br></p><p>“Still, this is a very good technique. Perfect for any Sorcerer.” Gojo-san commented as he ate a spoonful of pudding and brightened up.</p><p><br></p><p>“I think this is a perfect technique for me. I can make so many dishes with this.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Make dishes….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm obviously. I am a chef after all.” I smiled, earning me a loud laugh from the man.</p><p><br></p><p>“True words. Anyways, I came here to inform you three about a few things. As you know the current situation is quite bad, with the increase in the number of curses and all that. There has been a change in the school administration. The previous governing body….retired. So there will be a bit of time before you all can visit the school.”</p><p><br></p><p>Naruto jumped in excitement.</p><p><br></p><p>I guess not going to school was always good news for him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Buuuuuut no need to worry. We will be bringing some of the students here to meet you all. Be respectful to your Senpais. As for me, I need to be out for a while. There are a few curses which need to be exorcised.” His face changed a bit when he said the last part. I will keep dropping by when I can but you won’t be able to bask in my awesomeness as much as you want. Alright alright, I know you are sad. Anyone would be. I am awesome after all.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Anyways….I need to go to the Dojo now. Good bye.” I excused myself as the white haired man pouted.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Natsume Minagawa -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Where the hell are the reinforcements? Why haven’t they arrived yet?” She cursed as Gryphon blocked another monster from jumping at her and threw it away with a gust of wind.</p><p><br></p><p>Originally more people had arrived but others had returned with the three people who were chasing Tobio and were defeated by some onmyoji according to Tobio.</p><p><br></p><p>She knew he was lying and it was probably the devil but since Tobio didn’t say anything, she didn’t either.</p><p><br></p><p>The Devils and the Fallen Angels were enemy factions and she didn’t want to point them towards someone who had just saved one of her classmate’s life.</p><p><br></p><p>The rest of the members took the boys back to investigate further as these were the first ones they had captured alive.</p><p><br></p><p>Tobio was laying behind them, the injury on his leg aggravated. His Sacred Gear was fighting off things which were trying to harm him but they were barely keeping up with the help of their newest addition, Magician Lavinia.</p><p><br></p><p>“There are too many of them, we won’t be able to fight them all. We should leave and find a place to hide.”</p><p><br></p><p>“They know of our base. We cannot go back there.” Lavinia replied while raising a huge wall of ice between them.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly, Tobio spoke from behind them. “We….we could go to Silas-san’s place.”</p><p><br></p><p>Her neck snapped in his direction. “You’re not serious. That guy is a devil. Sure he saved your life but who knows what he would do. Haven’t you heard the stories on how bad devils are?” She shouted.</p><p><br></p><p>“Not all devils are bad.” The one who answered was surprisingly their newest companion. “I work for the Grauzaberer Magician Organisation which is run by Mephisto Pheles. He is one of the oldest devils alive and has been nothing but good to me.”</p><p><br></p><p>Tobio, as if finding some courage, also replied. “Yes. Silas-san….is a friend. If he wanted to harm us, he could have done so earlier. He didn’t and instead helped me. See….I have known him for a while now. Even Sae-chan knew him. He will not hurt us. And as for the stories, Fallen Angels were not exactly the good guys in those either and yet here they are helping us.”</p><p><br></p><p>She opened her mouth to argue but couldn’t find any valid reason to deny.</p><p><br></p><p>The wall of ice surrounding them was cracking and some monsters were trying to climb above it but were pushed off by Gryphon to the other side.</p><p><br></p><p>If the wall breaks, they will soon be overwhelmed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tch….let’s go there. We are already at a dead end. Gryphon!” She commanded as it used a massive gust of wind to push the monsters away from the wall and as if just waiting for this, the wall crashed, directly falling on the monsters below, crushing several of them under it.</p><p><br></p><p>All three of them made a run for it.</p><p><br></p><p>She hoped for once that Tobio wouldn’t be wrong about the Devil.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Silas -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I reopened my shop the next day.</p><p><br></p><p>Last night the training with the Masters of Ryozanpaku had been extremely exhausting.</p><p><br></p><p>Those people wanted to see how far they could push my body and they were not the kind of people who ever held back.</p><p><br></p><p>I lost my consciousness thrice and was brought back by Akisame-sensei.</p><p><br></p><p>And perhaps the strangest thing in all this was that I was feeling fine after a good night’s sleep.</p><p><br></p><p>Is this because of my Demon Heritage?</p><p><br></p><p>Who knows?</p><p><br></p><p>The first was as usual Saitama.</p><p><br></p><p>I noticed that he looked particularly glum today.</p><p><br></p><p>“What’s up Saitama?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah Silas….” he sat down in his usual seat and sighed. “I…<em>sigh.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>“Did something happen?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I….I lost the last strand of hair on my head.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>I could have laughed….but I didn’t. No.</p><p><br></p><p>Saitama was my friend….so I forced my laugh in an awkward snort.</p><p><br></p><p>I patted his shoulder. “Don’t mind. There are several people who spend so much time keeping their heads waxed. You are getting all that for free.” I reassured him.</p><p><br></p><p>“But I don’t want to!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha don’t mind the details. You know what? I will bring you your favourite, all on the house.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Really!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Promise.”</p><p><br></p><p>At this time the door to the Restaurant opened and a blue haired girl entered, staring at us and as soon as the door closed, it opened again, revealing a large man in a black suit of plate armour.</p><p><br></p><p>“Silas, Saitama.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Silas, Saitama.”</p><p><br></p><p>Both of them said at the same time.</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>Both of us were surprised at the same time too.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s me, Mikami.” The girl said.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am Suzuki.” The man spoke at the same time.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the two were stunned and looked at each other in surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>After a full hour of explanation, I found myself staring at my familiarly unfamiliar friends.</p><p><br></p><p>“So you got into a game and were transported into a whole other <a href=\"https://world….in\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">world….in</a> your game character? Damn that’s wild.” Mikami or rather Rimuru said.</p><p><br></p><p>“And you were stabbed and transported to another world, how is that any different?” Suzuki or rather as he is called now, Ainz complained.</p><p><br></p><p>“I mean I kinda died and was reincarnated….well you get the difference.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No no, I don’t get the difference.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Still, three of us four suddenly became something else. Only Saitama is a normal human now.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It doesn’t matter. We are friends.” Mikami cheered everyone by bouncing on the chair in his slime form.</p><p><br></p><p>All of us smiled at this.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>We are friends.</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way Suzuki….I mean Ainz. I have a question.” Saitama raised his hand.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Now that you are a skeleton, what do you eat? Also, if you eat Bone Soup, will it be cannibalism? And do you poop?” Saitama asked, curious, making Ainz facepalm while both Rimuru and I burst out laughing.</p><p><br></p><p>“I do not need to eat anything. And what do you mean by cannibalism?”</p><p><br></p><p>“And poop?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously I don’t need to poop either! What would I even poop, bone powder?” He bristled before a green light flashed around him and he calmed down.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright alright calm down.” Rimuru placated Ainz and looked at me. “By the way how did your world suddenly turn into a Supernatural one?” Rimuru asked me, diverting the topic quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>I shrugged. “The hell do I know. As far as it looks, the supernatural world always existed, they just kept it hidden from normal humans….or maybe it was just me due to my….well you know.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But still, it’s crazy. You were chased by pokemon and pokemon trainers.” Rimuru spoke seriously.</p><p><br></p><p>“They were not pokemon. He didn’t keep them in pokeballs.” I interrupted.</p><p><br></p><p>“That doesn’t prove anything. Ash doesn’t keep his Pikachu in the Pokeball. Still a pokemon. And you said it was a dog which came from an egg. Only Pokemon do that.” Rimuru countered and I was completely speechless.</p><p><br></p><p>He did make a fair point.</p><p><br></p><p>“He might not have a pokeball.” Ainz pointed out.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ohh. I mean what’s the possibility of him not knowing how to use a Pokeball?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Nah….Nobody can be such a noob.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Agreed.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Agreed.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Agreed.”</p><p><br></p><p>Well yeah.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well not Pokemon then. Thankfully you had learned magic. Still, it was quite dangerous. You should be more careful. Who knows what else is there in the outside world.” He put a hand on top of a jug of water and blue liquid poured and filled the whole thing. “This is a Full Restore Potion. It can heal any injuries, even regenerate limbs and damaged souls. You should keep this with you in vials. We never know when we might need something like this.”</p><p><br></p><p>I stared at the liquid in front of me with my mouth wide open.</p><p><br></p><p>“Rimuru is not wrong, Silas.” Raising a hand, Ainz spoke as several armour and weapons appeared on the table, creating a large stack. “You shouldn’t go around unprepared. Before this, your heritage was under a seal and you were not recognised by anyone but you said that that girl recognised you as a devil in a single glance and was cautious, even a bit aggressive. Thankfully you were inside the Restaurant and not outside so you should take measures when you go out next time. These are some weapons and armour for you. Later I will send some Pleiades as guards here.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm….thank you?” I said looking at the armour. How would I act lowkey when I walk around in these?</p><p><br></p><p>“What are these Pleiades you talk about?” Rimuru asked the question which I was meaning to ask.</p><p><br></p><p>“They are the battle maids who protect Nazarick.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Maids! Ainz, you have maids?” Rimuru asked, surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>“Umu. I am the King of Nazarick now. Obviously I will have maids.” He nodded proudly.</p><p><br></p><p>“So… are you rich now?”</p><p><br></p><p>I believe I saw a smirk on his bony face if that was even possible. “I have more gold than everyone in the room and the room itself… together.</p><p><br></p><p>“Holy fuck! And here I was living in huts made by dwarves. Ainz is paying for everyone today.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, hmm. Ainz pay.” Saitama nodded as well.</p><p><br></p><p>“Very well. Today’s bill shall be paid by me… Ainz Ooal Gown.”</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled. “Well, today’s food was on the house as we were celebrating Saitama going completely bald today.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hey! That’s not something to celebrate.” The man in question bristled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm….then we can celebrate you saving all that shampoo cost from now on.” Rimuru suggested.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well….that does sound <a href=\"https://goo….no\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">goo….no</a> hold up a bit!”</p><p><br></p><p>We all burst out in laughter at his reaction.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a strange scene. A bald hero, a talking skeleton, a slime and a devil walked into a restaurant… I can make a fucking joke out of it.</p><p><br></p><p>And yet, even in this strange scene, I felt strangely <em>normal</em> again.</p><p><br></p><p>I got up to prepare everyone’s orders and looked at the three of them, especially the annoyed looking Saitama and the two who were teasing him. “Well look on the bright side, Saitama. Now all three of you are bald.” I laughed and ran away, leaving all three annoyed and shouting.</p><p><br></p><p>Ainz showed everyone the pictures of the maids. He had even programmed those maids for us. It was only to shoot a promotional video but talk about a coincidence.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru was fanboying over the maids while Saitama seemed almost interested but was keeping them company nonetheless.</p><p><br></p><p>Sakura was out to do some shopping as it was still early so I carried over the food to them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ahhh, I missed this taste.” Mikami or rather as we know him as Rimuru cheered. It was hard to know where his eyes were but his voice conveyed his emotions quite clearly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oi, Suzuki… ah, I mean Ainz, can I take your share?” Saitama said, eying his plate.</p><p><br></p><p>Ainz in reply picked up the plate and we saw in wonder as he cut the meat and took a bite and the food just disappeared in his mouth. It didn’t just fall down on the chair.</p><p><br></p><p>“You liar! You said you couldn’t eat.” Saitama shouted pointing fingers at him.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t know why but that bony face seemed a little smug at the moment. “Correction. I said I don’t need to eat. I never said that I couldn’t. How do you think I use potions?”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru and I burst out in laughter looking at Saitama’s dumbfounded face.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a strange scene. </p><p><br></p><p>We sat there and ate together as the door to the Restaurant opened again.</p><p><br></p><p>It was Miu and Naruto. They were going to school and I had offered to cook them a bento each as Naruto was hesitating to go to school.</p><p><br></p><p>Safe to say both of them agreed. In fact, I was going to prepare some for Touma and Cid too as they made it a habit of taking bentos from my Restaurant everyday.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a good prospect so I agreed too.</p><p><br></p><p>Generally Tobio would be included in this group as well but I don’t think he would come today.</p><p><br></p><p>But there was something which all of us ignored.</p><p><br></p><p>“Aghhh! Ghost. Miu Nee-chan, Nii-san, there is a ghost in the Restaurant.” Naruto jumped and hid behind Miu.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl herself looked scared.</p><p><br></p><p>I facepalmed while Ainz looked a bit abashed while Rimuru was rolling and laughing in his place.</p><p><br></p><p>Saitama had a look of schadenfreude.</p><p><br></p><p>“He is not a ghost, Naruto. Don’t be afraid. Also, you are learning to be a Jujutsu Sorcerer, how can you be afraid of these things?” I tried to calm him down.</p><p><br></p><p>It took several minutes of explanations to make them believe who he was.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh! Suzuki-san and Mikami-san?” Miu quickly bowed and apologised and made Naruto do the same.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, assured that Ainz was not a ghost, Naruto pranced around looking at him from all angles.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hey hey Ainz-ojisan, are you really a skeleton now?” He asked, curiously.</p><p><br></p><p>….I had a weird sense of deja vu.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then do you eat? And can you poop?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Naruto!” Miu scolded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Pfft ahahahaha I can’t take this anymore.” Rimuru burst out once more.</p><p><br></p><p>I cracked up too.</p><p><br></p><p>If a skeleton had lips and they could twitch then it would have looked exactly like Ainz’s look right now.</p><p><br></p><p>A green light washed over him and he relaxed and patted Naruto’s head with his skeletal fingers.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, I can eat and no I don’t need to poop. Everything is taken care of by magic.”</p><p><br></p><p>….huh.</p><p><br></p><p>Well well, would you look at that?</p><p><br></p><p>Ainz can be a softie too.</p><p><br></p><p>While I went in to prepare their bento’s Naruto played around with Rimuru who was using different forms to play with him. Saitama and Ainz just watched everything on the side.</p><p><br></p><p>As I was cooking, several other people came in.</p><p><br></p><p>Touma was the first followed by Cid and then Kisuke-san.</p><p><br></p><p>Zeref was next and he was followed by a red haired woman in a witch’s costume.</p><p><br></p><p>The man came directly to me and bowed, apologising for the events of that day.</p><p><br></p><p>I let out a sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>He was actually trying to help me and he did so by implanting whatever it was that he did in my body so that my body could produce Demonic Power and survive.</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t need to apologise. If anything I should be the one apologising. You saved my life that day and I….was extremely rude to you. I am sorry for that. Please have a seat. Let me treat you both today.”</p><p><br></p><p>They sat down and I quickly made something for the two of them and severed them.</p><p><br></p><p>It was probably the first time that I had seen someone cry after eating a meal….literally.</p><p><br></p><p>The red haired woman with Zeref was actually shedding tears as she ate the food in front of her.</p><p><br></p><p>I brought some more food for her since she looked like she hadn’t eaten in years.</p><p><br></p><p>Meanwhile, Touma was meeting with Rimuru and Ainz.</p><p><br></p><p>He had known the two so he recognised them after they introduced themselves.</p><p>Cid was with him, listening to their talks.</p><p><br></p><p>Next to come in was Tohru.</p><p><br></p><p>She hadn’t come yesterday, maybe scared or embarrassed about that day’s incident.</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm b-boss. About that day. It’s….I didn’t know that you didn’t know….I….”</p><p><br></p><p>I let out a sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s fine. I was just taken by surprise at the information and overreacted. You don’t need to feel sorry. Just that from the next time if you see or find something odd, make sure you inform me in private about it.” I rubbed her hair and her tail swung, her face brightening at my words. Seriously, this girl was adorable.</p><p><br></p><p>“Anyways, get ready and get to work. There are customers waiting for their orders to be taken. I will go and prepare the orders.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Boss!”</p><p><br></p><p>She saluted before looking over my shoulder and staring.</p><p><br></p><p>I followed her gaze and found that she was looking at the red haired woman who also seemed to have stopped eating and stared at us.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is there something wrong?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh? No. I just didn’t think there were any more dragons in the Restaurant.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Dragons?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Her. The red haired woman is a dragon.” She pointed towards Zeref’s companion.</p><p><br></p><p>“....oh. And?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh, nothing. You just told me to tell you anything I found in private.”</p><p><br></p><p> “....alright. Anything else?”</p><p><br></p><p>She came near my ear and whispered. “By the way boss, that blue haired girl is a slime or at least smells like one and that undead sitting with him. They look suspicious. Do you want me to take care of them?” She conjured a flame on her hand.</p><p><br></p><p>“No no no no. They are my friends. Don’t mind them. In fact, those two were humans before and became like this later on. They are regulars of our Restaurant.” I quickly explained to the trigger happy Dragon girl before she went throwing firebreaths everywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh. It’s fine then. I just thought they looked suspicious.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the two….they did look suspicious.</p><p><br></p><p>At this time Sakura also returned from her shopping and paused at Ainz’s form.</p><p><br></p><p>I was about to explain to her before she was surprised but she didn’t even react to him and walked towards me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are there new guests, Silas-san?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah….” I looked at her open-mouthed.</p><p><br></p><p>Really….just that? Nothing else?</p><p><br></p><p>Not even a yelp?</p><p><br></p><p>There is a literally walking talking skeleton lord eating cake on the table for fuck’s sake.</p><p><br></p><p>Even I was more surprised than that when I first saw his skeleton face and that was after he explained everything in advance.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well….technically they are old customers. They are Mikami and Suzuki. It’s a long story. I will tell you later. Anyways I think you have already seen them.”</p><p><br></p><p>Meanwhile Rimuru and Ainz watched me talking to her but didn’t say anything.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! I….am sorry, I  didn’t recognise them.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No no, don’t mind it. None of us did.” I waved it off. “I even had to ask some security questions to verify.” And I call myself a good friend of theirs.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at the  two of them and bowed politely and the two awkwardly waved back. She then turned towards me. “I will go and change quickly.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright.”</p><p><br></p><p>She walked back upstairs and as soon as she was gone, I fell a tug on my side and was pulled to Rimuru’s table.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is this a thread?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Steel thread.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And you spit it out? I thought you turned into a slime not, I don’t know….spiderman!” I pointed, looking at the thread.</p><p><br></p><p>Steel threads.</p><p><br></p><p>Damn.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t try to divert the topic Silas. Now out with it, what going on? Are you….living with a girl? Also, who is that waitress with the horns and tail? Saitama told us she was a dragon. Are you living with two cute girls while we two were stuck with different worlds? Hell I even got a Great Sage Skill because I was single for almost forty years. I thought we had a pact dammit.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What pact? Why don’t I know of this pact?” I asked, confused. “Also, Tohru is the same dragon you guys were there when we removed that sword from her back. She wanted to pay Naruto and me back for that day and is working as a waitress here.” I explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“That….that dragon became this cute girl?”</p><p><br></p><p>“You are a slime and you can become….this….are you a girl or a boy?” I asked, realising I didn’t know that.</p><p><br></p><p>“Not the point!” He quickly waved off the topic. “What about Sakura-chan?”</p><p><br></p><p>“She….things happened.” My face darkened as I remembered the incident. “Her adopted family was….let’s say unlikable and leave it at that.”</p><p><br></p><p>The two noticed my look and became quiet.</p><p><br></p><p>“Were they hurting her?” Rimuru asked and I noticed the red in Ainz’s eye becoming brighter.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hurting is not a good enough word for what they were doing.” I explained the situation to them briefly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is that Zouken guy alive?” Ainz asked, casually but I had known Suzuki enough to know that he was pissed.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the usually emotionless Saitama was sombre.</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t know about any of this as he wasn’t here when Sakura was treated.</p><p><br></p><p>“No.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Tch. Lucky bastard. I would have given him to one of the floor guardians to play with and then made him a Death Knight to protect Sakura-chan for the rest of his life.” He clicked his….tongue? And said.</p><p><br></p><p>And although the rest of us didn’t understand any of his words, we understood his sentiment.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>A few moments of silence prevailed over the table and Rimuru was now feeling a bit awkward and broke the silence.</p><p><br></p><p>“Still, Silas is now living with two extremely cute girls. Ainz, say something.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well….” The skeleton suddenly fidgeted and all three of us zoned in on him. “I….also have female members, especially the guardian overseer Albedo….and well….”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Son of a bitch.</p><p><br></p><p>We suddenly realised that this guy was living with cute maids and hot girls all around.</p><p><br></p><p>Saitama was uninterested as usual but Rimuru looked at both of us with hung jaws, as if questioning reality.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why! Silas I can understand but Ainz….you don’t even have a….” </p><p><br></p><p>“Hey!”</p><p><br></p><p>The guy banged his head on the table in depression as both Ainz and I looked at each other. It was quite hard to make out the expressions on Ainz’s face but he was looking partway between smug and offended.</p><p><br></p><p>In a sense, it was understandable.</p><p><br></p><p>While he was understanding all wrong, I was still living with Sakura and Ainz had….well whatever he said but Rimuru on the other hand had just lost someone close in his world.</p><p><br></p><p>I couldn’t see his look so I decided to drop in a bit of good news. “If it’s any consolation, Shizuka-san comes over sometimes and she even asked about you….thrice.”</p><p>Suddenly all his depression flew out of the window and he looked up at me, inches away from my face. “Really!”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Weren’t you depressed just now?</p><p><br></p><p>But I realised that he had successfully diverted everyone’s mind from our grim moods just now.</p><p><br></p><p>I talked to them for a while before I had to leave to cook.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, you guys talk. I will go and prepare the orders.” I got up, leaving the three to have fun.</p><p><br></p><p>Just as I was about to walk inside, the door to the Restaurant opened again.</p><p><br></p><p>This time however the guests were unexpected.</p><p><br></p><p>Tobio and two blonde girls came rushing inside their….NotPokemon behind them.</p><p><br></p><p>All of them paused looking at Ainz and Rimuru, especially Ainz and then the girl in the lead shouted.</p><p><br></p><p>The bird with her got in front of her protectively but didn’t attack or even try, probably too intimidated.</p><p><br></p><p>Ainz did look like a character straight out of a B Grade Horror movie so it was understandable and so I barely stopped myself from facepalming.</p><p><br></p><p>Was this going to be a regular thing?</p><p><br></p><p>“Ohh, is this the Pokemon guy?” Rimuru jumped from his seat, looking at the dog and the bird carefully.</p><p><br></p><p>Tobio limped to the front first, “Please let us stay here. Those monsters… they are…” he huffed but I saw that the sprain on his leg was worse now.</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t get to stay much as we heard a loud thud on the wall of the Restaurant. There was no damage to the restaurant but the sound of the nearby houses being attacked was easy for us to understand.</p><p><br></p><p>Do these bastards not care about the life and death of the neighbours at all?</p><p><br></p><p>I looked outside the window to see over a dozen of those monsters trying to break in. The other customers looked outside too.</p><p><br></p><p>“What exactly are those?” Touma asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Those are Pokemon alright.” Rimuru commented.</p><p><br></p><p>“They are… our classmates. Some people kidnapped them and bound monsters in them and now they are like this. Those people are after us because of our Sacred Gears.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Your what?” Rimuru asked while a question mark formed on his head.</p><p><br></p><p>Literally. I mean his body literally changed to form a question mark on his head.</p><p><br></p><p>“Our Sacred Gears. This is mine, called Gryphon.” The blonde girl informed us while the other girl strangely took a seat and started to look through the menu without a care in the world.</p><p><br></p><p>“They are not Pokemon?!”</p><p><br></p><p>“What?! No!”</p><p><br></p><p>“See, I told you so.” I shrugged my shoulders.</p><p><br></p><p>“You didn’t tell us about what they were.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I didn’t know what exactly they were but hey, I did tell you they were not pokemon.”</p><p><br></p><p>Our argument was interrupted by someone’s voice.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, are these the things who attacked you that day?” Kisuke-san looked outside and asked. I nodded before turning towards Tobio and his friends who looked exhausted.</p><p><br></p><p>“You all stay here. I will check and check it out.” I told them and headed towards the door, one hand, reaching for my knife.</p><p><br></p><p>A hand fell on my shoulder and stopped me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Silas. There are too many of them. Let me.” Ainz stood up, his bony frame towering over us as his voice took on a royal tone. He was in full on roleplaying mode right now.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru changed into his own blue haired human form. “I’ll help too.”</p><p><br></p><p>Zeref stood up and walked ahead too. “Let me also help out a bit to make up for the inconvenience I caused earlier.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I’ll help out too. I’m a Hero after all.” Saitama stood up. \"I just need to get my hero costume first.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Cid was looking afraid. “Silas-san….I….I’ll will leave and maybe see if someone can help.” He said before running out.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tch what a sissy.” Tohru clicked her tongue looking at Cid’s back. “Well don’t worry boss. These types of things are my specialty. I will be done in a jiffy.” </p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t be so hard on him….he is just starting Magic School so it was understandable if he was perturbed by the monsters. He even offered to find help so you shouldn’t be angry. Just make sure you don’t hurt the kids.” I ordered, remembering what Tobio had told me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Please. Our friends. They don’t want this. They are just being controlled. It’s the people after them.” Tobio pleaded to the ones walking out too and I noticed that there were some older people behind the entire group.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did these people….kidnap Sae-chan?” I asked and he nodded, making me narrow my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>These bastards were kidnapping people from this area. What if they kidnapped someone from my Restaurant or someone close to me?</p><p><br></p><p>I needed to take care of them.</p><p><br></p><p>Sakura came down at this time, looking around confused. “Sakura-chan, can you see that they get some rest? I will take care of the things outside.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You take care and get healed, kid. We will solve this mess.” Rimuru laughed before applying some of the blue potion on his leg and I watched in awe as it was healed instantly.</p><p><br></p><p>That potion worked so well.</p><p><br></p><p>Ainz on the other hand had already donned his armour  and taken the lead, standing outside the shop, in quite a grand manner if I might add.</p><p><br></p><p>He started facing the one who seemed to be the leader of the group.</p><p><br></p><p>\"We are Ainz Ooal Gown. This place is under our protection. We do not believe they have caused you any harm. For what reason do you attack this place?\"</p><p><br></p><p>One by one the other people in the Restaurant came out as well.</p><p><br></p><p>Rimuru, Kisuke-san, Tohru and I.</p><p><br></p><p>The reply he got was not favourable in the least.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hehehehe a lowly knight and a lackey of a little devil at that, is questioning us? This is so funny, teacher.” A young girl dressed in purple gothic style clothes pointed at Ainz and laughed. “Hey teacher, can I kill them? Please, please pretty please?”</p><p><br></p><p>Is she mad?</p><p><br></p><p>A man dressed in a suit beside them scowled at me and then looked at Tobio. “Tch, to think that the Five Principal Clans have fallen so low as to allow such filthy creatures. It just shows that they are not worthy of their titles anymore. Do you see this? Do you still think they deserve to rule?”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>What the fuck, dude?</p><p><br></p><p>I haven’t even opened my mouth yet and you are dissing me already.</p><p><br></p><p>The woman with the crazy girl looked at Ainz and replied. “Why do we attack, you ask? We do this because we want to do this. I mean, do you care for every ant walking in your path? No. They just get crushed. It’s not intentional, just your bad luck to encounter us. In this world weaklings like you have no right to speak.” There was no inflection in her voice, not even disdain.</p><p><br></p><p>….these people….they were complete psychopaths.</p><p><br></p><p>Ainz however was completely unmoved by their crazy banter. He took a step forward and spoke.</p><p><br></p><p>\"You are correct.”</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, you tell them Ainz….wait what?</p><p><br></p><p>“The weak have no right to speak. They can only listen. But I am a kind man, so I will give you a choice… Do not cause any trouble here. If you choose to not listen to advice, both you and your entire organisation will burn.\"</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>What the fuck, dude?</p><p><br></p><p>Is he really Suzuki? Did he go off the deep end already?</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hehehehe they are so funny, teacher. A little warrior, a young girl, a pretty boy and a weak devil. They want to take down the Wizards of Oz and the Utsusemi Organisation. Can I kill them please?\" The girl beside the woman laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>At this time another figure appeared from my Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>He was wearing a Gold and purple trim adorn a dark jacket, shirt, pants, and high boots. A long hood casts a shadow to hide the upper half of his face. The only discernible facial features were his mouth and the glow of red eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>We looked at him questioningly and he spoke. “I was asked to help by a black haired boy from the Midgard Knight Academy. Is there any danger here? Am I late?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! Cid sent help.” I….wasn’t expecting anyone but the guy actually went around asking for help.</p><p><br></p><p>It made my impression of the quiet guy improve by a lot.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, nothing has started yet. You are on time, Cid-kun” Rimuru spoke before I could say anything further, making me stop.</p><p><br></p><p>“Say what?”</p><p><br></p><p>Tohru also whispered. “Yes Boss. It’s that Sissy.”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy was also taken aback but collected himself almost instantly and spoke in a deep voice. “Who is this Cid-kun you speak of? My name is Shadow: he who lurks in the shadows to hunt the shadows.\"</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Was Ainz affecting others now or was this guy also a chunni?</p><p><br></p><p>“Hehehehe they keep on increasing, teacher. And this guy is so funny. Can I fight him please?”</p><p><br></p><p>\"No need to waste time on trash. Get the targets and kill the rest. Attack.\" The guy commanded as one of his subordinates raced towards Ainz while he himself raced towards Cid.</p><p><br></p><p>I gripped my knife and was ready to make a move.</p><p><br></p><p>The children and their monsters surrounding us rushed towards us at the same time.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy was the first to make a move as he reached Ainz and bashed him with what looked like a staff with iron rings on it.</p><p><br></p><p>Is this guy an idiot? Would those even go past his plate armour?</p><p><br></p><p>My doubts were erased a moment later when the ground under Ainz’s feet shattered as a wave of ice enveloped his form. “Hahahaha poor knight….do you think we are enemies who can be defeated by waving around that oversized blade of yours?”</p><p><br></p><p>I was about to slash at the guy almost reflexively but Rimuru held my hand back. I looked at the guy questioningly as he lifted his hand and pulled a Spiderman, throwing steel threads towards the attacking children, enveloping them in cocoons.</p><p><br></p><p>“Keep watching.” He said as he stood guard beside me.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked towards the frozen pillar and saw it crash as a hand came out of it and grabbed the head of the attacker.</p><p><br></p><p>The man tried to remove it but no matter what he did, it was useless. He repeatedly bashed his staff on Ainz but there was no reaction at all.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, true. A greatsword is indeed not good to deal with flies. For things like these….using bare hands is more convenient.” And with that said, he clenched his hand, crushing the skull of that guy.</p><p><br></p><p>My grip on my knife shook.</p><p><br></p><p>I was pretty sure I heard someone yelp behind us.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>A sudden moment of silence enveloped the whole place as Ainz looked towards the rest of the attackers and spread his hands. “Come flies. Understand the futility of your efforts.”</p><p><br></p><p>“As expected. Ainz probably had high level ice and physical attack resistance. I didn’t sense him receiving any damage.” A second later, Rimuru spoke softly.</p><p><br></p><p>My neck snapped to look at the human turned slime.</p><p><br></p><p>That was a freaking pillar of ice, you know? He was frozen.</p><p><br></p><p>Can something like that even be called resistance?</p><p><br></p><p>But then again, I had seen Gojo-san do something like that too so I could contain my surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>“Rimuru-san, can you bring some of those kids here? I want to see if I can find a way to fix them.” Kisuke-san asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I think I might be able to help with this too.” Zeref stepped up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure thing.” Rimuru went Spiderman once again, pulling the cocoons from before to our side and in front of Kisuke-san and Zeref for them to take a look.</p><p><br></p><p>I wanted to check out what they were doing but didn't have time to think much as the older of the men, the one who was commanding the force of NotPokemon trainers, shouted in rage. “You filthy bastards! Attack them, kill them all.”</p><p><br></p><p>The remaining kids suddenly changed their direction towards Ainz</p><p><br></p><p>“Please, don’t kill our friends. They are not in control.” Tobio pleaded again.</p><p><br></p><p>But instead of Ainz, this time there was someone else facing them.</p><p><br></p><p>Cid-kun stood in between them and asked. “It’s fine if I attack the monsters, right?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. That shouldn’t be a problem.” Kisuke-san said from behind us. “These monsters are more of a spiritual creation than actual monsters. Even if they die, the host would at best lose consciousness for a while, depending on the degree of attachment. They can always be cured.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Very well then.” Cid-kun nodded as a black coloured sword formed from his cloak into his hand and the very next instant, he disappeared from his place. What I saw were afterimages as he flashed between dozens of attacking monsters and they kept on shattering.</p><p><br></p><p>Fucking hell!</p><p><br></p><p>And he is supposed to be a beginner student at the Academy?</p><p><br></p><p>Cid-kun made his way through the crowd and within seconds was facing the man in the lead.</p><p><br></p><p>The man was stronger than the one who faced Ainz and was raising some kind of earthen Golems to send towards us.</p><p> </p><p>The woman and the crazy girl also joined the fight, summoning what looked like a magic circle and attacking us with a hail of elemental attacks.</p><p><br></p><p>“Bakudo Number 81, Danku.” A voice sounded before the attacks could hit us and blocked the attacks.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked back to see Kisuke-san with a hand raised in our direction while still looking at the subdued students.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. So you people are truly hell bent on dying.” Ainz spoke as his armour changed into a garb or some kind and a golden staff appeared in his hand. “In that case, let me fulfil your wishes.” He lifted the staff and several beings similar to those elementals I had seen in games appeared and faced the golems and the older woman.</p><p><br></p><p>Back with the students, Zeref called the woman beside him. “What do you think of this, Irene?”</p><p><br></p><p>“They have enchanted some kind of energy onto the children to develop the monsters in their souls and done a terrible job at that. The monsters act almost like parasites, overwhelming their minds. If their goal was to give them power, a gradual process would have been much better than just shoving a monster inside them.\" The red haired woman had appeared beside Zeref before I realised and checked the children before speaking.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. It’s like someone awakening their inner spirits, kinda similar to a Zanpakuto but their incomplete knowledge of souls made the whole process go haywire and now, instead of the kids controlling the spirits, they are being controlled by them.” Kisuke-san spoke.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Can you use your Separation Enchantment to remove the monsters from them?\" Zeref asked the woman.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I can but it will take some time.\" She replied but had already started working on one of the children whom Rimuru had captured.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hmm. Let me try something.” He turned towards Touma. \"Can you try to remove this? I believe you deactivating the enchantment will do the work.\"</p><p><br></p><p>The boy in question went hesitantly towards the tied up boy, removed his glove and touched it.</p><p><br></p><p>The target spasmed before fainting while the monster roared and collapsed.</p><p><br></p><p>The woman looked at Touma in awe and shock.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Kisuke-san was looking stunned at Touma.</p><p><br></p><p>\"It's as I had guessed. Your gift is really something Touma-kun. Although, I'd suggest not touching the members of the restaurant because some of them are purely magical beings and might get seriously hurt by it.\"</p><p><br></p><p>“Indeed. I suggest wearing gloves like that inside the Restaurant at all times.” Kisuke-san said.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy in question nodded profusely.</p><p><br></p><p>On the other side, the fights were getting heated up too.</p><p><br></p><p>Ainz was skillfully keeping the woman’s attacks at bay while she was using some kind of purple fire which was giving me severe chills even looking at it.</p><p><br></p><p>On Cid-kun’s end, he was almost done too.</p><p><br></p><p>The man fighting him had one of his hands severed and I might not be a master or anything but even I could tell that at this point, he was just playing with him.</p><p><br></p><p>Similarly, Rimuru had bound the crazy goth girl in a cocoon.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are not a warrior? What are you? Who are you people?” The woman screeched as part of her face was burned from the attacks of Ainz’ elementals.</p><p><br></p><p>“We are Ainz Ooal Gown. With this name at stake, there can be no defeat.”</p><p><br></p><p>I won’t lie but….damn if that wasn’t cool.</p><p><br></p><p>Ainz lifted his hand and all his elementals bombarded the area, completely devastating the woman.</p><p><br></p><p>When the smoke cleared, the woman was still standing but looked like she would fall at any time.</p><p><br></p><p>“How disappointing? I expected more from someone claiming to be strong….after all, even a mosquito bite is supposed to sting.” Ainz looked at her and spoke in a calm tone.</p><p><br></p><p>Meanwhile I was wondering how the fuck he had so many cool dialogues. Did he write them in his spare time?</p><p><br></p><p>There is no way he was just winging everything.</p><p><br></p><p>\"You think you have won? You will all die. My people will not let you live in peace so long as any of us still breathe. You will be hunted down till the end of hell.\" She screeched.</p><p><br></p><p>\"The wailings of a defeated foe.\" Ainz waved it off and was about to kill her but was stopped by a voice..</p><p><br></p><p>“Please let me. I have a score to settle with her.” Surprisingly, one of the girls with Tobio, if I recall correctly, she was called Lavinia, stepped forward to the face of the woman with a wand drawn to her face. “This is for my teacher.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ainz didn’t interfere and watched.</p><p><br></p><p>“Your teacher?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am Glenda Goodwitch’s disciple.” The girl gritted through her teeth. “Today, I will avenge my teacher.”</p><p><br></p><p>The woman looked at her and her face morphed into a smile that can only be described as… creepy.</p><p><br></p><p>“Your teacher… Glenda… she’s alive.” The woman laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl paused. “... you are lying. I saw you kill her with my own eyes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I didn’t kill her. Whose research do you think these monsters are? All from Glenda’s research.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You people extracted information from her forcibly.” She gritted out.</p><p><br></p><p>The battle had almost finished and all of us quietly watched the two, trying to figure out the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>Ainz walked to my side and whispered into my ear. “This looks like a classic anime plot, doesn’t it? I bet five bucks That Glenda woman is still alive and captive.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I think she is just trying to mess with her by lying to make her switch sides for more information. Ten bucks.” Rimuru whispered back.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ohh, can I join in? I personally think this woman is just buying time to do something.” Kisuke-san walked in and whispered. The fuck dude. Where did you come from?</p><p><br></p><p>Even Cid-kun, who had arrived by our side after finishing his fight and Tohru nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hat and Clogs, sounds right. Do I blast her off, boss?” Tohru asked. </p><p><br></p><p>These guys, are they monsters?… oh wait…</p><p><br></p><p>“No Tohru, no blasting people off.” I whispered back but even I was watching the scene.</p><p><br></p><p>In the meanwhile, the woman took out something from her waist and did something to the talisman. “Glenda.”</p><p><br></p><p>Another voice appeared on the other side. “What do you need from me, Augusta?”</p><p><br></p><p>I saw Lavinia pause, her body freezing completely.</p><p><br></p><p>“Your former apprentice is seeking you and wants to kill me. Don’t you have anything to say to her?”</p><p><br></p><p>“... Lavinia? She was an interesting subject because of her Longinus but that’s it. Her Sacred Gear helped my research. I have no use for her now.” The call was cut.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl Lavinia looked as if she was devastated and Augusta laughed before quickly swiping at her but the next second Augusta’s body fell down as a flash of light surrounded them.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Lavinia stood up and a figure which looked like a doll of ice appeared behind her as purple flames appeared around her once more while the original body of the woman lay beside her.</p><p><br></p><p>She laughed but her voice now seemed to be overlapping with Augusta’s. “You wanted to kill me, right. So die. You, your friends, this entire country DIE!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Possession?” Ainz said. </p><p><br></p><p>“That’s troublesome.” Kisuke-san tugged his hat down.</p><p><br></p><p>Well obviously.</p><p><br></p><p>You people were busy playing Vegeta.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry. We just need to cut off their connection and the girl will be safe.” Rimuru said.</p><p><br></p><p>Cut off?</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly a thought struck me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let me try something.” I said, going forward. “Just cover me, alright.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Got it.”</p><p><br></p><p>I took a position with the knife once more as the woman sent those same spine chilling purple flames at me.</p><p><br></p><p>Several magical barriers formed in front of me, blocking the attacks.</p><p><br></p><p>I bit my tongue, forcing myself to push back the fear of those flames and concentrate on the thing I wanted to do.</p><p><br></p><p>The knife in my hand changed shape once more, taking the shape of a cleaver.</p><p><br></p><p>My Cursed Energy flared, before concentrating on the blade as a silver black aura enveloped it.</p><p><br></p><p>Cut off the connection between them.</p><p><br></p><p>Cut off the connection between them.</p><p><br></p><p>Cut that woman’s soul.</p><p><br></p><p>With this single thought in mind, I waved my knife.</p><p><br></p><p>One moment Lavinia was attacking us and the very next moment, her body fell while the woman’s body jolted awake as she let out a piercing shriek, looking at us with bloodshot eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nooooooooo! You bastardssss! The Wizards of Oz and the Utsusemi Agency will never let go of this. You will all be chased till the ends of this world. None of you will be able to take a single breath of peace so long as even one of us lives.” The woman continued to curse.</p><p><br></p><p>I however was not paying any attention to that.</p><p><br></p><p>It worked.</p><p><br></p><p>It actually worked.</p><p><br></p><p>“That was some impressive show of magic, Silas.” Zeref said as he patted my shoulder. “Let me take care of the rest.”</p><p><br></p><p>The woman with Zeref looked towards Zeref with a smile. \"It's not everyday you get to see Emperor Spriggan in action.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Emperor? Is Zeref a King or something?\"</p><p><br></p><p><strong>– Ainz –</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Ainz watched as the harmless looking guy walked forward and the next moment, his eyes widened… or would have if he had eyes. The amount of magic power he was releasing was insane.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Since we will not be able to rest while you live, there is only really just one solution to this. I just have to make sure there are no survivors. But I will still give you a chance… surrender… or perish.”</p><p><br></p><p>The woman however had lost her mind already and a wave of fire rushed towards us.</p><p><br></p><p>Zeref joined his hands in the position of prayer and opened them to show a sphere of magic circles formed between them. \"Very well. You have chosen your own fate. I invoke… Law.\"</p><p><br></p><p>The sphere of black magic expanded almost instantly and Ainz didn’t even have the chance to resist before it passed over him and then went beyond the horizon till nothing could be seen anymore.</p><p><br></p><p>Before he could ask what was happening, the remaining monsters all crumbled apart and the children fainted. The women also fell to the ground, lifeless.</p><p><br></p><p>Lavinia fell to the ground too but I could see that she was breathing slowly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wh-what was that?” The other blonde girl struggled but finally asked.</p><p><br></p><p>The red haired woman who was giving off a feeling of danger from the very start explained. “Spriggan Law. It defeats anyone the user designates as an enemy. No defence works against it. With the Emperor’s strength, he can easily cover a large country with its effect. Once you are hit by it… you lose.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>A green light flashed over him.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see.” Was all he could utter but not because he didn’t have any thoughts.</p><p><br></p><p>His thoughts were on hyperdrive.</p><p><br></p><p>An AoE, targeted OHKO with a defence ignore, covering an entire country.</p><p><br></p><p>What the hell? Someone call the admins! This guy is hacking!</p><p><br></p><p>Really. He didn’t even doubt the woman’s words because she was talking about it as if she had witnessed it more than once already.</p><p><br></p><p>The harmless mage with the sad backstory turned out to be a fucking raid boss in disguise. Even now he looked at the open jaws of everyone else.</p><p><br></p><p>This kind of Skill was gamebreaking and would have been nerfed to the lowest pits of hell in the very next patch and here, this guy looked as if he wasn’t even bothered.</p><p><br></p><p>What if the world where Nazarick had landed had something like this guy too?</p><p><br></p><p>Wouldn’t he go to sleep one day only to continue sleeping forever?</p><p><br></p><p>It was good that he asked Demiurge to search the other areas first.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe he can establish some trade agreements with Zeref and Mikam… Rimuru too.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Slow and steady was the way to survive.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did I miss something? Where are the monsters?” At this time a voice came from behind them and Saitama walked out with a yellow costume and white cape.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Meanwhile Silas was thinking about what would happen to the now destroyed neighbourhood.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong><a href=\"https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>This chapter took around 1.5k more words than usual.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The chapter would have been a day early but damn this fever.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Anyways, we have reached this point.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Things will be a bit slower than in the snippet with more events explored in more detail as Silas trains and gains power gradually.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Look forward to the next chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br><br><br><br><br></p>",

Why the fuck was he cussing me then?</p><p><br></p><p>Was he being sarcastic?</p><p><br></p><p>I mean he did get punched but that was Touma dammit.</p><p><br></p><p>The man looked confused at my question. “You are a demon, right?”</p><p><br></p><p>Treating customers politely is something my Father had hammered into me when taught me about the restaurant and it was because of this that I didn’t snap at the guy who was obviously cussing me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Dear customer, I apologise for the inconvenience that you have faced in my Restaurant but I would like to request you not to use such language.” I asked politely, restraining my annoyance.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked taken aback at my response….like genuinely taken aback.</p><p><br></p><p>If I didn’t know the situation, I would have thought that I was in the wrong here.</p><p><br></p><p>He then looked closer, raising a hand and closing an eye. I saw several lights flash in his hand but I knew that the Restaurant would protect me so I didn’t do anything.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy then opened his eyes. “I see. There is a seal on you. No wonder.”</p><p><br></p><p>Right at this time Tohru came into the Restaurant and greeted me. “Good evening, Boss. I am here.” She suddenly paused, realising the oddity of the scene. “Did something happen?”</p><p><br></p><p>I shook her head and looked at Zeref. “I don’t know what you mean by that Sir but I am not a demon.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh! You’re not a demon? Are you of some other Demonic Race, Boss?” Tohru exclaimed, making everyone look at her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why would you even think that? Did I do anything bad to you?” I asked, annoyance slightly ringing my voice.</p><p><br></p><p>She realised it and quickly waved her hands. “No no. It’s not like that Boss. You are one of the best people I know. I mean I didn’t even know demons could be kind, let alone as kind as you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright hold it.” I raised a hand stopping her. “Why exactly do you think I am a Demon?”</p><p><br></p><p>She tilted her head. “Huh? I mean you are a demon because you are a demon, just like I am a Dragon because I am a Dragon. What else could I mean? Although you keep everything sealed, I can still smell a Demon from miles away.” She puffed her chest pridefully while I froze. Everyone in the Restaurant had gone quiet.</p><p><br></p><p>I mechanically turned towards Zeref. “What….what is this seal that you were talking about?” I asked, quite stiffly.</p><p><br></p><p>Zeref understood that there was something wrong with the situation and hesitated but spoke nonetheless.</p><p><br></p><p>“There is a seal on you which is sealing your true nature. It is quite an elaborate seal, not like anything I have ever seen before, although not difficult to remove.”</p><p><br></p><p>My breathing got faster and I could feel my heart thundering in my chest.</p><p><br></p><p>Zeref….I didn’t know but Tohru, was someone I knew quite well. I knew her personality and she would never….ever insult me like this.</p><p><br></p><p>With a shivering voice I asked him. “This seal….can you remove it?”</p><p><br></p><p>No one spoke a word and the man in question nodded and stepped towards me, placing a finger on my forehead.</p><p><br></p><p>I felt some kind of shackle release on my body and suddenly felt something on my back as gasps sounded in the place.</p><p><br></p><p>Turning back mechanically, I saw two bat-like wings jutting out from my back….that was the last thing I saw before the world around me went back.</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I opened my eyes and saw the ceiling of my Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>Saitama was sitting beside me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Silas, dude, are you alright?” He asked in his usual monotone.</p><p><br></p><p>“Me? Ah yes. I remember I had this weird dream where I was suddenly a demon and even had wings behind my back.” I spoke as I got up. “Seriously, I must be working too hard to get dreams like that.”</p><p><br></p><p>Between my Restaurant, learning Jujutsu and Martial Arts, I was actually overstretching my limits. Did I faint while working?</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, Jujutsu was also not the fun and happy kind of magic I was imagining it to be and it was normal to have such dreams sometimes.</p><p><br></p><p>Me being a devil. I chuckled at the thought.</p><p><br></p><p>A voice awakened me from my thoughts.</p><p><br></p><p>“But that was real though.” I looked at Kensei Maa who was staring at me from the side of the couch.</p><p><br></p><p>Looking around, everyone was looking at me with worry but among them, my eyes caught one person.</p><p><br></p><p>Zeref.</p><p><br></p><p>….and my eyes widened.</p><p><br></p><p>“What happened to me right now?” I asked, almost growled.</p><p><br></p><p>“I removed the seal on you and those wings were released but you apparently didn’t have enough demonic power if any at all and thus fainted when it started running in your body. I checked and found that your demonic power reserves were negligible. In fact, you are a demonic being who doesn’t have any Demonic Power at all….well, almost. I did a quick fix on you by implanting a Demon Seed in your body. It’s producing Demonic Power and nourishing your body as we speak.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am not a Demon. I can’t be a demon” I gritted out, perhaps more to myself than to others. I am a human dammit. I have been since I remembered it.</p><p><br></p><p>What the fuck Demonic Power and what fucking seal?</p><p><br></p><p>“I think you are misunderstanding something. Demonic Beings are not all mindless killers. You shouldn’t hold prejudice against them.” Zeref tried to explain.</p><p><br></p><p>Saitama placed a hand on my shoulder but I was having an existential crisis at the moment.</p><p><br></p><p>“I….I need some time alone. I will excuse myself. I’m sorry for the inconvenience.”</p><p><br></p><p>I got up and walked back to the second floor of the restaurant which also served as my home.</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully, Sakura was not at home. She had gone out to do shopping for her necessities since she stayed here now.</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly got out of the room and left the place through the backdoor, not going back to the Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I walked out on the roads on the outskirts of Kyoto. The sky was cloudy and the nearby lights weren’t working but I could see everything clearly.</p><p><br></p><p>There were only some abandoned buildings around the place.</p><p><br></p><p>Unlike Kyoto, this town was quite rundown and one of the reasons why I could even get a place here.</p><p><br></p><p>I found an empty park and entered, emotionally exhausted. </p><p><br></p><p>Demon.</p><p><br></p><p>I am a demon.</p><p><br></p><p>How could I be a demon?</p><p><br></p><p>Wasn’t this some normal world? Why did demons pop out all of a sudden? I suddenly found the familiar world became completely unknown within just a few minutes.</p><p><br></p><p>The fact that I was meeting with people with supernatural powers all along had reduced the amount of shock I was under but it was still something I was having a hard time wrapping my head around.</p><p><br></p><p>Did mom and dad know of this?</p><p><br></p><p>Were my parents also demons?</p><p><br></p><p>I reincarnated into this world, lived eighteen years and now all of a sudden, I am a Demon.</p><p><br></p><p>Was I already reincarnated as a demon or did I become one later?</p><p><br></p><p>There were so many questions in my mind, so many things I wanted to ask but had no idea whom to ask, so many things I didn’t know and now….I don’t think I would ever know.</p><p><br></p><p>I sat down on the bench in a park, closing my eyes, letting the breeze calm down my thoughts. It was cold and I was still in my chef uniform. Hell I ran away so fast that I didn’t even have the time to remove the knives from my holster.</p><p><br></p><p>I let out a sigh and closed my eyes trying to cool my head.</p><p><br></p><p>But today was just not for me.</p><p><br></p><p>I heard a crashing sound behind me and looked back to see what looked to be a boy of fifteen or sixteen jumping from the first floor of the building and surprisingly a dog jumped behind him.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at me and shouted. “Run, they are coming. Run.”</p><p><br></p><p>That voice?</p><p><br></p><p>“Tobio?” I was taken aback. “Tobio, it’s me Silas. Why are you running? Who is coming?” I asked, going forward to pick him up.</p><p><br></p><p>He had sprained his leg in that jump.</p><p><br></p><p>“Silas-san. Hurry, we need to run.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What happened?” I asked him as I picked him on my back. The dog didn’t do anything to me.</p><p><br></p><p>Tobio pointed towards the building. “There, run quickly!”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the place he was pointing and saw a car sized spider kind of creature carrying a boy and climbing down the building.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy however seemed weird. He pointed towards us and the spider jumped.</p><p><br></p><p>What the fuck?!</p><p><br></p><p>There are Cursed Users here?</p><p><br></p><p>I turned heel and ran quickly with Tobio on my back.</p><p><br></p><p>I noticed that my speed was faster than before. Even without reinforcing myself with Cursed Energy, I was covering several metres with a single step.</p><p><br></p><p>Was it because of my Demon heritage? If so then, for the first time in the last hour, I was feeling thankful for being demon.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps an equally surprising thing was that the dog was able to keep up with my speed.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy chasing us was joined by two more such monsters.</p><p><br></p><p>“Fuck! Just what in the blazes are those?” I shouted.</p><p><br></p><p>“That boy….he was my classmate who had gone missing. I don’t know but he is being controlled somehow.”</p><p><br></p><p>I needed to outrun them. Suddenly I remembered the wings I had.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>I had wings.</p><p><br></p><p>Come out.</p><p><br></p><p>Come out.</p><p><br></p><p>“Come Out!” I shouted loudly.</p><p><br></p><p>I felt the same feeling from my back and with the next jump, I was in the sky. The puppy</p><p><br></p><p>“What….what are you?!” Tobio squeaked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Trust me….I am having a very confusing day as well.” I explained as I tried to fly away, unfortunately it was easier said than done.</p><p><br></p><p>I felt something latch onto my foot.</p><p><br></p><p>I lost my balance and tumbled down.</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully, our drop was cushioned by a fountain below.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked down to see….a spider web from that spider.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tobio, run!” I shouted. I noticed his dog had jumped protectively in front of him, a black coloured blade coming out from its forehead as it growled at the approaching monsters.</p><p><br></p><p>Was it a Shikigami?</p><p><br></p><p>I had heard about them but this one didn’t look like one.</p><p><br></p><p>What is it?</p><p><br></p><p>A pokemon?</p><p><br></p><p>I shook my head and turned towards the other side.</p><p><br></p><p>Those three monsters were running towards us.</p><p><br></p><p>I needed to fight.</p><p><br></p><p>“Silas-san.”</p><p><br></p><p>Dammit.</p><p><br></p><p>I wasn’t good at this.</p><p><br></p><p>I could fight some low level curses but I didn’t know about these.</p><p><br></p><p>Still I drew my kitchen knife and positioned it in front of me, taking a stance and took a deep breath, preparing to fight.</p><p><br></p><p>“Silas-san, please….he is not conscious. He is being controlled.” Tobio begged from behind me.</p><p><br></p><p>I heard him but concentrated on the situation in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>My adrenaline was rushing to my head but instead of panicking, I was feeling calmer instead.</p><p><br></p><p>This cold weather, the water under my foot, the knife in my hand and my….wings out as I faced the enemy, as much as it weirded me <a href=\"https://out….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">out….it</a> felt natural. It was as if a lock had been opened on my being. As if a haze that was constantly on my mind was lifted.</p><p><br></p><p>I remembered Nanami-sensei's words about Innate Techniques.</p><p><br></p><p>They are a part of my own self and they would manifest in things I am the most comfortable in.</p><p><br></p><p>What was I the most comfortable in?</p><p><br></p><p>I raised the knife in front of my chest and felt a pulse from it.</p><p><br></p><p>The knife was the same one which was impaled on Tohru’s back and she had someone use it to make a knife for me. With a pulse, the knife’s shape changed from a Santoku Knife to a Cleaver, but I wasn’t paying attention to it.</p><p><br></p><p>With the haze completely lifted, I finally understood what my Innate Technique is.</p><p><br></p><p>I made the same motion which I used to cut meat.</p><p><br></p><p>My Cursed Energy roared. I don’t know if it was because of the seal or whatever Zeref had done to me but the amount was a lot more than I had before.</p><p><br></p><p>“Slice.”</p><p><br></p><p>The spider on the boy’s back….was sliced clean through the middle and the boy fell down on his face, tumbling several steps but not a hair on his body was cut.</p><p><br></p><p>I think I heard Tobio gasp behind me but my attention was occupied by the other two following him.</p><p><br></p><p>One of them had a rat type monster on him and the last one had a lizard type.</p><p><br></p><p>I turned the knife and made another motion towards them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Dice.”</p><p><br></p><p>Those two monsters which had jumped towards us were diced into a small square block and the boys under control tumbled down, unconscious but <a href=\"https://unharmed….at\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">unharmed….at</a> least by my blade.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are they?” Tobio asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I didn’t cut them but I am not sure about anything the monster did to them. Let’s go away from here. They could have reinforcement and I don’t know how strong they will be.” I quickly kept the knife which had reverted back to the normal shape and told him before I picked him up on my shoulder, taking to the sky.</p><p><br></p><p>The dog jumped and grabbed the end of my trouser and I rushed towards my Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>Only there did I have the confidence of being completely safe.</p><p><br></p><p>We reached the Restaurant and I quickly shut the door after me.</p><p><br></p><p>The place was empty.</p><p><br></p><p>“Silas-san….just what are you?” Tobio asked, hesitantly.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am….well you can call me a sorcerer I guess.” I was not lying.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then those wings?” he asked. “Was it magic?”</p><p><br></p><p>I winced.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s….trust me, I am also as confused as you are. Anyways, just how did you get in this mess and what is that Dog? Is it a Shikigami? Are you an Onmyoji?” I asked, diverting the topic.</p><p><br></p><p>I wasn’t comfortable talking about this topic yet.</p><p><br></p><p>“An Onmyoji? No.” He shook his head. “This….I got an egg from a friend and this Dog hatched from it….” By the time he finished the sentence, his voice had become too low to be heard. I guess he was realising the insanity of his words too.</p><p><br></p><p>Good for him that I had seen crazier things.</p><p><br></p><p>“So it’s like a Pokemon.” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wha….Pokemon? No. It’s….”</p><p><br></p><p>“A digimon?”</p><p><br></p><p>“What’s a digimon?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sigh….anyways, you said your friend gave you the egg. Call them and see if they know anything.”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded and called someone.</p><p><br></p><p>Apparently Sakura had heard the commotion and came down to see what was going on too.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at me and I was thinking about how to tell her what I was….</p><p><br></p><p>I looked back at Tobio. “You can stay here. Call me if you want something. I need to do something.” I told him as I walked towards Sakura.</p><p><br></p><p>She understood my intentions and walked upstairs and I followed her.</p><p><br></p><p>A thousand thoughts were going through my head.</p><p><br></p><p>I had all but dragged her out of her home to provide her a safe place to live and now I tell her that I am a demon….sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sakura.”</p><p><br></p><p>She turned towards me. “Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I….” I hesitated thinking about how to phrase this properly but couldn’t think of anything so I decided to tell her everything in detail about what happened today.</p><p><br></p><p>She, to her credit, listened to everything I had to tell quietly and didn’t even try to run.</p><p><br></p><p>Was she not believing me?</p><p><br></p><p>“I….I am not joking you know.” I closed my eyes and willed my wings to pop out, attracting her attention.</p><p><br></p><p>I saw her staring at my wings and looked at her. “See….I am….a demon.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm and?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah….what?”</p><p><br></p><p>“You are a demon. But you are also the same Silas who saved me from that hell….made by humans.” She replied, making me stunned.</p><p><br></p><p>“Not everyone is like that, Sakura. Several of the people who helped us were also humans.” I argued with her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then why should all demons be bad?”</p><p><br></p><p>“....” I tried to say something but no words came to my mouth.</p><p><br></p><p>She came forward and hugged me.</p><p><br></p><p>I remembered just a few days ago, I had done the same thing.</p><p><br>“Before human or demon, you are Silas-san who couldn’t see a girl he barely knew in pain and did whatever he could do to help her. Even after knowing everything about me, the dangers of the situation, you didn’t back down and gave me a new chance at life. Never forget that.” She said, her voice even without even the slightest hesitation.</p><p><br></p><p>I was rendered completely speechless.</p><p><br></p><p>“Just like there are people like the other patrons of your Restaurant who are good humans and people like….him who are lower than monsters….I don’t see why there can’t be good demons too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Tell me Silas-san. Did your parents love you?” She asked and I might have been wrong but I saw a hint of hurt in her eyes at the name of the words parents.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do your friends here like you?”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“And do you think they did all that just because you were a demon?” She shook her head. “No. They like you because you are you. You are Silas.”</p><p><br></p><p>Throughout the entire conversation, her voice was calm and gentle, not a hint of fear or disgust I was expecting. Hell, even I was suddenly afraid of my own self on the discovery and yet, she was still treating me the same way.</p><p><br></p><p>It made me feel a bit ashamed of myself.</p><p><br></p><p>I was actually able to get a life after dying once in my previous life. I got to meet such loving parents, I got this power and got to meet such wonderful people….and instead of being grateful for this chance….I was complaining….how pathetic was that?</p><p><br></p><p>Sakura was right in this regard.</p><p><br></p><p>I returned her hug and we stood there like that for a while.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you, Sakura.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p><br></p><p>She pulled back a bit. “You ran away without eating anything. Please take a seat. I will cook something quickly. Will your friend be eating too?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“No….let me cook.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Please….let me. Your friend looked like he was very scared. You should go and comfort him.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded, thanking her again.</p><p><br></p><p>Recalling something, I went to my room and brought the first aid box, a bucket of warm water and a clean towel with me and went down stairs.</p><p><br></p><p>There, Tobio was on a couch, rubbing his injured leg.</p><p><br></p><p>“Here, use this.” I passed over the things to him.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy was surprised at my sudden arrival. He was still jumpy from the incident and I didn’t blame him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.” He began cleaning his injury and bandaging himself up.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly recalling something, I couldn’t help but ask. “Were those people also on the cruise with Sae-chan?”</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. The girl who always visited my Restaurant with him had gone missing along with several other people on the cruise and he said that those people who attacked us had gone missing too.</p><p><br></p><p>What was going on here?</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded and then looked up at me. “Silas-san. Do you know what I can do to find Sae? You are….I mean you know magic right? So do you have any ideas?” He almost pleaded.</p><p><br></p><p>“I….am more of a recluse who has just started learning magic because I got lucky. I have no idea about the Supernatural world, let alone about something like this.” I shook my head.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked disappointed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry, Tobio-kun. I am sure that you will find her soon.”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, did you live in the apartment where you jumped out from?” I asked, suddenly recalling how we had just met.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah yes.” His voice grew dim. “They found me there.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Why exactly were they chasing you?”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the puppy following him. “I am also confused, Silas-san. Suddenly the whole world seems so alien.” The frustration in his voice was something I could sympathise with.</p><p><br></p><p>I put a hand on his shoulder. “Don’t worry. You will get used to it. If you want somewhere to stay, you could always stay here. The house beside this was something which belonged to you previously. I still haven’t gotten to reconstruct it. You can use the rooms there..” I offered.</p><p><br></p><p>“This….thank you but I just had a talk with my friend. She said that she would take me to their safe house.” He replied.</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded. “Alright.”</p><p><br></p><p>At this moment, Sakura came out with two plates of food.</p><p><br></p><p>“Come on. Let’s eat something.”</p><p><br></p><p>I then looked at the dog.</p><p><br></p><p>“Does it eat?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I….don’t know.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the guy weirdly and he was actually embarrassed.</p><p><br></p><p>Sakura brought some leftover pork ribs for the dog too. Actually, the puppy was quite friendly with Sakura.</p><p><br></p><p>We ate in silence.</p><p><br></p><p>Each of us had our own thoughts in our heads.</p><p><br></p><p>Around half an hour later, there was a knock on the door. Tobio looked there and I nodded to him before checking.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a young girl with light brown hair. She had a slim and voluptuous figure. She was wearing a school uniform and looked at me surprised and dare I say a bit on guard.</p><p><br></p><p>“I didn’t know there was a devil in this area. From what I know, this area is neutral ground and no members of the Three factions lived here.” She asked cautiously but I picked up several words in her sentence just now. Devil. Three Factions.</p><p><br></p><p>Was that what I was?</p><p><br></p><p>A Devil?</p><p><br></p><p>But I didn’t let her know anything. “As you said, this area is neutral. I don’t see why I would have to take anyone’s permission to stay here.” I replied calmly but firmly.</p><p><br></p><p>A bird flew on her shoulder and glared at me.</p><p><br></p><p>I narrowed my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly Tobio came back from behind me. “It’s fine. Silas-san is someone who helped me and saved my life.”</p><p><br></p><p>Her cautious tone told me that I shouldn’t ask her because then she would know about my situation and can lead me to anything. Better not take risks.</p><p><br></p><p>Need to search for more information.</p><p><br></p><p>“In that case, I’ll thank you for saving my friend’s life. Come on Tobio. Let’s go.”</p><p><br></p><p>He left after thanking me once more and I closed my shop’s door.</p><p><br></p><p>The last few hours were emotionally exhausting.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe a short nap will help me out.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sakura, I am very tired so I will go to bed early today.” I bid her a good night and left for my room.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Silas -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I woke up the next day, feeling much better.</p><p><br></p><p>The sleep was exactly what I needed to get myself together.</p><p><br></p><p>I guess the events of yesterday caught me off guard. Maybe it had something to do with the curses I had seen and fought. I had always thought of them as demons.</p><p><br></p><p>I will have to apologise to the customers of the Restaurant, especially Zeref.</p><p><br></p><p>Now that I remember, he said something about my body collapsing from a lack of Demonic Power and he did something to fix it.</p><p><br></p><p>Sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>I got up and got cleaned and ready for the day.</p><p><br></p><p>Walking into the kitchen, I saw that Sakura had already cleaned the place and was cleaning the tables.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good Morning, Sakura.” I smiled at her.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked back at me and smiled. “Good morning.”</p><p><br></p><p>So, let’s see what to cook today.</p><p><br></p><p>I wanted to make something as an apology for the customers of the Restaurant for yesterday’s behaviour.</p><p><br></p><p>I did have a dish in mind.</p><p><br></p><p>A dish my dad had shown me, something made for French Royalty.</p><p><br></p><p>It was made from rabbit meat and coincidentally I had just the thing in my possession. I pulled out a large piece of Cheese Rabbit meat.</p><p><br></p><p>This thing actually had a very thick and flavourful meat, absolutely perfect for the dish.</p><p><br></p><p>The Lièvre À La Royale.</p><p><br></p><p>It was one of the hardest things I could make and now, with my new Skill Level, I think I could make it too.</p><p><br></p><p>This dish comprised five parts: Lièvre Ensemble, Rabbit Blood &amp; Chocolate Sauce, Royale Custard, Chestnut Confit and a Fig-Apple Purée Sauce.</p><p><br></p><p>This should be enough as an apology.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I opened the Restaurant when I was done with the preparations.</p><p><br></p><p>The first one to come was Saitama.</p><p><br></p><p>“Silas. Man, are you alright?” He sat down beside me. If I didn’t know better, his rather bland tone would have made me feel worse instead but I knew that the guy cared in his own way.</p><p><br></p><p>Especially after Suzuki and Mikami had stopped coming to the Restaurant suddenly, the guy had started feeling lonelier.</p><p><br></p><p>I admit I was not different either.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps it was also because of this that I had started pushing myself too much into learning Jujutsu. </p><p><br></p><p>Those two idiots had really become quite close to us in such a short time and now without those two, only Saitama and I were left so we were quite close.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am alright. I just… it was too much for me to process all of a sudden. I am sorry that I overreacted like that.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t mind. Don’t mind. It’s fine.” He waved casually.</p><p><br></p><p>One by one other guests started coming to the Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>“Silas-san, are you okay?.” Miu asked me, looking worried. She was with Naruto beside her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nii-san. Here, this is for you.” Naruto gave me a good luck charm. I smiled and patted his head.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you not afraid of me?” I asked, hiding my hesitation behind the smile.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh? Why would I be afraid? We had to leave early so we couldn’t see them but  Kensei-sensei told us that your wings looked really cool. Hey! Can I see them?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Naruto! I am sorry for him, Silas-san.” Miu apologised.</p><p><br></p><p>I chuckled.</p><p><br></p><p>“No no it’s fine.” I closed my eyes and willed my wings to pop out, earning a gasp from the duo.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s so cool! Hey hey, can you fly?” Naruto jumped around me checking out my wings from all directions.</p><p><br></p><p>“I can.” I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Really! That’s so awesome. I wish I had such wings too.” He had a shine in his eyes when asking for this. I laughed and brushed his hair.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then I will take you to fly out sometimes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yay! Don’t forget okay. I will hold you onto it.” He jumped.</p><p><br></p><p>Behind them, Hayato-san, Kensei-san and Shigure also came.</p><p><br></p><p>“Kensei….was right. Your wings….look cool.” Shigure gave me a thumbs up.</p><p><br></p><p>“See, I told you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha I heard that you can fly with them too? So many things can be done when you can move in the sky. A whole new world of martial arts. You missed yesterday’s class so we are going to train you till you fall today. There is no way we are going to let you waste all that potential.” He laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>I sweatdropped.</p><p><br></p><p>What do you mean train me till I drop?</p><p><br></p><p>You already did that before.</p><p><br></p><p>Cid also came in but he was not there yesterday.</p><p><br></p><p>“What’s today’s order, Cid-kun?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, I would like some yakisoba please.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. It will be done in a moment.” I looked towards the rest and took their orders.</p><p><br></p><p>Before preparing the orders though, I served the dish I had prepared for everyone.</p><p><br></p><p>“Here is something from my side as an apology for yesterday’s behaviour.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh, you didn’t need to do that.” Kensei-sensei shook his head but took the plate nonetheless.</p><p><br>Naruto, especially, was having a blast.</p><p><br></p><p>While I was in the kitchen several others came as well.</p><p><br></p><p>Nanami-sensei and Gojo-san, the latter coming after a long time.</p><p><br></p><p>Kisuke was next to arrive.</p><p><br></p><p>Sakura served them the rabbit dish and took their orders.</p><p><br></p><p>When I came out, the new arrivals were looking at me with different types of gazes.</p><p><br></p><p>Nanami-sensei’s gaze was….complicated.</p><p><br></p><p>Kisuke was looking at me as if he wanted to dissect me and knowing what little I knew about the man, that might actually be the case.</p><p><br></p><p>Gojo-san looked at me, pushing up his glasses. “Oh, you do look a bit different than before. So I heard you got wings now? How do they work?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I….” I willed my wings to appear and both Kisuke and Gojo-san looked at it in interest.</p><p><br></p><p>“How fascinating. They just appeared. You were not folding them back either. And they seem to phase through the clothes.” Kisuke said.</p><p><br></p><p>“I heard that you were under a seal of some kind. Did you find out anything about it?” Nanami-sensei asked, finally breaking his silence.</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded. “I think I might have a clue. Yesterday, a girl called me a Devil and said something about Three Factions. I intend to find more about it later.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Devils and a girl? Sounds like you had quite an adventure.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I went out and encountered something yesterday. Those things were like curses attached to people and were chasing a friend. I fought them and brought the guy back here. It was one of his friends who said that she didn’t know that there were devils in this area as this was supposedly neural grounds.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Curses?”</p><p><br></p><p>“They looked like curses but were mostly shaped like animals. A Spider, a rat and a lizard monster attached to three people. Tobio said those people were his classmates who had been kidnapped a while ago and now they reappeared like that. Those three looked almost as if they were puppets. I took him and ran but couldn’t run away on time so I chose to fight. I think… I might have awakened my Innate Technique.”</p><p><br></p><p>“How interesting. You said you awakened your Innate Curse Technique. Did you take them down? How strong were they?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I….don’t know.”</p><p><br></p><p>I seriously didn’t know.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh? What do you mean you don’t know? Ah, then how about this, how were they compared to the curses you fought the last time?” Gojo-san asked.</p><p><br></p><p>I shook my head. “I don’t know. All it took was one attack from my new Technique and they were down.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hoh! One attack you say. Now I am really interested. Let’s have a spar after dinner today. I want to see what else you gained from yesterday’s debacle aside from your Cursed Energy increasing several times over.”</p><p><br></p><p>The spoon in Nanami-sensei’s hand fell on the table with a clank as he looked at me as if seeing a ghost. “Several times?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Around three times more really.” Gojo-san waved his hand and took a bite of the dish. “Hmmmm yesss. You overdid yourself with this one, Silas-kun.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you. Glad you liked it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, Silas-kun, if you need any help in investigating your new….heritage, you can always come to me for help. I would love to work with a….devil, you said.” Kisuke offered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm….thanks….” And no thanks.</p><p><br></p><p>I am a devil….not an idiot to accept that proposal.</p><p><br></p><p>The guests of the Restaurant all behaved normally. Some were curious while some were casual.</p><p><br></p><p>Cid for example told me that their world has many races of people like humans, elves, demi-human races like cat people, dog people, etc.</p><p><br></p><p>I guess when considering that my Restaurant was connected to so many weird places, my new identity almost seemed normal in comparison.</p><p><br></p><p>By evening when there was no one in the Restaurant, I went outside to test out my new Innate Curse Technique from a spar with Gojo-san and learn more about it.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Unnamed Yakuza -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“What is the situation there?” He asked over the call.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a period of silence on the other side before a reply came. “Everything was wiped out, boss. There is nothing left here….except the bodies.”</p><p><br></p><p>He gritted his teeth.</p><p><br></p><p>It was their sixth base in the past few months. Just who the hell was it? Who was doing all this?</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you find any clues?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Nothing. All the bodies seem to have died the same way, drowned in water.”</p><p><br></p><p>He slammed the table in front of him, breaking it in two.</p><p><br></p><p>“Dammit!”</p><p><br></p><p>This was surely some magic user but who?</p><p><br></p><p>He knew about the supernatural due to his connection with the Utsusemi Agency. They were the actual background leaders of this gang and he was just a convenient face for the organisation.</p><p><br></p><p>It was obviously not for free as he did gain a lot of benefits from the whole deal.</p><p><br></p><p>They had given him the knowledge of the greater supernatural world and magic and helped him awaken Flame Pulse, a Sacred Gear.</p><p><br></p><p>He raised his hand and a wisp of fire flickered on his palm.</p><p><br></p><p>The Utsusemi Agency were the exiles of the Five Principal Clans, who basically controlled a large part of the whole country’s supernatural world.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the exiles from those clans had enough knowledge of magic to make someone like him from a roadside thug to the leader of one of the top gangs of the entire Tokyo.</p><p><br></p><p>The magic taught by those people and his Sacred Gear helped him solidify his position as one of the strongest yakuza leaders. He basically ruled over this area. The only other gangs he couldn’t take over all had supernatural backing of their own or had Sacred Gear users and the Utsusemi Agency didn’t want to ruffle too many feathers, especially now that they seem to be doing something big. Everyone was being extremely secretive.</p><p><br></p><p>All his targets were selected carefully so that he didn’t set onto the toes of someone strong.</p><p><br></p><p>This was a rule which had helped him not only survive but also flourish till now then how….how did he mess up?</p><p><br></p><p>All people dying from drowning….this couldn’t be done by normal means.</p><p><br></p><p>It had to be the work of the supernaturals.</p><p><br></p><p>Was it some youkai?</p><p><br></p><p>Those pesky things could be vicious but then again, Tokyo was a strictly regulated city and Youkai didn’t gather there.</p><p><br></p><p>Was it other gangs?</p><p><br></p><p>Was it some crazy sacred gear user?</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, take care of the bodies and then return. Don’t wander around the area.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes boss.”</p><p><br></p><p>The call was cut and he put a hand over his face.</p><p><br></p><p>“I thought that I would get a promotion after overtaking that restaurant with two leylines which the boss had been after, instead I get fucked up like this. Shit! If I find out who did this, I will burn them to the ground.” He growled, sending a fireball on the broken remains of the table, completely erasing it.</p><p><br></p><p>Tch.</p><p><br></p><p>Now the carpet was ruined.</p><p><br></p><p>“Someone clean this mess!” he shouted loudly and brought out a cigarette and lit it up, taking a sip.</p><p><br></p><p>A minute passed but there was no reply..</p><p><br></p><p>“Dammit, can no one hear me? Clean this shit up already or someone else will need to clean your ashes, Genzo, Taku, where the hell did everyone go?”</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly a voice came from behind him.</p><p><br></p><p>“To the afterlife.”</p><p><br></p><p>He felt a chill run down his spine at the voice and jumped ahead trying to create a distance between himself and the unknown intruder and threw a fireball right behind him, creating a small explosion. Rolling on the ground, he looked back at the intruder to see a wall of water.</p><p><br></p><p>He hadn’t even sensed him.</p><p><br></p><p>The wall turned into snakes of water and rushed at him, he threw several fireballs at the snakes and tried to dodge.</p><p><br></p><p>With his experience, he understood that this was not a foe he could fight and tried to run but one of the snakes wrapped around his legs and dragged him into the air.</p><p><br></p><p>Other snakes of water bound his whole body and one wrapped around his neck.</p><p><br></p><p>The water wall subsided to reveal a figure in front of him. </p><p><br></p><p>“I have been trying to find you for the last three months and by now I am at the end of my patience so let me make a few things clear first. The more you delay answering any of my questions, the more these bindings will tighten. If you lie, they will bite your limbs off one by one. So it is my earnest advice that you do not waste any of my time anymore. Answer me, who do you work for?” The figure asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I….Hanezu Himejima. I work for Hanezu Himejima, the vice leader of the Utsusemi Agency….mmph.” He shut his mouth, eyes wide at the information he had revealed.</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t want to reveal it because he knew that they would kill him if he did then how….hypnotism. Mind Magic….dammit, how did he get inside his mind?</p><p><br></p><p>He had trained to not let something like this happen?</p><p><br></p><p>This….whoever this figure was….was way beyond anyone he had seen before.</p><p><br></p><p>“On whose orders did you kill the Evans family?” the figure asked, no inflection in his voice.</p><p><br></p><p>The Evans family?</p><p><br></p><p>Those restaurant owners?</p><p><br></p><p>Was this because of them?</p><p><br></p><p>Dammit!</p><p><br></p><p>He had checked them out and found nothing related to the supernatural factions on them except an independent magician.</p><p><br></p><p>His thoughts were interrupted by a sharp pang of burning pain from his leg. On looking down, he saw that his leg had been bitten off by that snake.</p><p><br></p><p>“AGHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!”</p><p><br></p><p>“You can continue shouting or answer my question. If you do the former, you will lose your other leg as well.” The figure said.</p><p><br></p><p>He gritted his tongue to control his pain and answered.</p><p><br></p><p>“The U-utsusemi Agency! They wanted <a href=\"https://the….restaurant….be\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the….restaurant….be</a>-because of the leylines under it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Who killed Rufus Beige?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Wh-who?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The magician Rufus Beigie.”</p><p><br></p><p>Was it that damned magician?</p><p><br></p><p>Wasn’t he retired already?</p><p><br></p><p>“I-it it was the Utsusemi Agency. They….said he was retired and….they took him down.”</p><p><br></p><p>He breathed as the world in front of him was blurring.</p><p><br></p><p>The blood loss was getting to him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Now for the last question….” A heavy pressure fell on him as the building started cracking and he finally realised what the figure in front of him was….a devil. It was a real Devil.</p><p><br></p><p>The voice which hadn’t shown any emotion till now was heavy with killing intent enough to knock him out had he not been bearing the pain from the loss of a limb.</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Where is Silas Evans?</em>”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Suzuki Satoru -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He closed the door to his room and slumped on his bed.</p><p><br></p><p>How did this happen?</p><p><br></p><p>How did he get stuck here?</p><p><br></p><p>All he wanted to do was spend the last hours and give Yggdrasil a well deserved goodbye and then maybe go and live in Mikami’s world which seemed still livable.</p><p><br></p><p>Everything was planned. Mikami even found out where they could get some fake documents and in return, he could sell the technologies to make money for themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>It was the perfect plan.</p><p><br>Even Silas supported them.</p><p><br></p><p>Alas.</p><p><br></p><p>During the last hour of his time he reminisced about everything in the game. He even took some liberties with changing the programming of some of the characters.</p><p><br></p><p>Albedo….</p><p><br></p><p>A green light surrounded him and he calmed down.</p><p><br></p><p>But he was not a selfish guy. He even made some maids for his bros at the restaurant and was going to show them the videos to let them bask in the glory of A VMMO’s maids created by some of the most brilliant minds in the world, his guildmates.</p><p><br></p><p>Mikami liked the cheerful and calm types so he programmed Aureole Omega and Lupusregina Beta for him. Saitama was becoming more robotic and he wanted to tease him with CZ2128 Delta. And for the man who made his exit plan viable in the first place, he changed Yuri Alpha and Narberal Gamma because he remembered him wanting to hire waitresses for his restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>While he couldn’t give him waitresses, a promotion video was good enough, right?</p><p><br></p><p>Otakus would totally swarm the place once such a video went online.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Sigh</em>.</p><p><br></p><p>Now though, even if he could give him the waitresses he wanted, he had no way to get back. Life took away from him when everything started to look better.</p><p><br></p><p>Was he really going to lose everything again?</p><p><br></p><p>Dammit!</p><p><br></p><p>He punched the wall in frustration and one of the cupboards moved revealing a door on the other side.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>This door?</p><p><br></p><p>Wasn’t this?</p><p><br></p><p>Then the thought struck him. Wasn’t Silas’ Restaurant connected to many other worlds? Did it mean that he could go back?</p><p><br></p><p>He quickly went ahead but paused in his step.</p><p><br></p><p>His current form would draw too many eyes. He remembered how scared people were the last time a dragon had peeked inside.</p><p><br></p><p>He needed something more….normal. After thinking of something, he created a full plate armour with Greater Item Creation Skill to cover his entire body and used Perfect Warrior to completely drain his mana away in case it had clues that could give away his new status as undead before he has a chance to explain himself.</p><p><br></p><p>Checking himself in the mirror once more, he seemed alright for now. Maybe, he could pretend to be cosplaying so he can explain everything first?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Sounds like a good plan.</p><p><br></p><p>Just in case, he informed the residents of Nazarick to not enter his room unless permitted.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Mikami Satoru -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He put the stone on the grave and markedit with her name.</p><p><br></p><p>Shizue Izawa.</p><p><br></p><p>The face of her smiling in her last moments appeared in front of his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Too bad monsters can’t cry or at least Slimes couldn’t.</p><p><br></p><p>The last few months of his life had been full of ups and downs.</p><p><br></p><p>One day he was planning to start a Game Company with Suzuki and the next thing he knows, he gets stabbed and becomes a slime.</p><p><br></p><p>He did find some friends in this place but damn if he didn’t miss his life back there. Especially now that he was feeling this pit in his stomach.</p><p><br></p><p>A glass of sake with some fried tempura would be just the thing he needed to drown his sorrows in. Maybe play some games with Saitama and Suzuki….</p><p><br></p><p>He wondered how his friends were doing. Did they miss him?</p><p><br></p><p>Suzuki would be so disappointed.</p><p><br></p><p>They had planned so much to get him out of that world of his.</p><p><br></p><p>But as the saying goes, the best laid plans of men and mice….</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe he can do the same with Silas or Hayato. Their worlds were not that developed as well.</p><p><br>Saitama on the other hand….his friend seemed as if he was losing his emotions bit by bit. Would he be alright?</p><p><br></p><p>There was also Shizuka-chan….the drunk homeroom teacher. She was quite cute too. He had promised to meet her again….</p><p><br></p><p>Did she ever come back to the Restaurant and ask about him?</p><p><br></p><p>And Silas….</p><p><br></p><p>Sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>Why were all the good things in his life being lost one after another?</p><p><br></p><p>He mimicked Shizue-san’s face in a form comfortable for him and returned back to the village.</p><p><br></p><p>“Rimuru-sama, Rimuru-sama. T-t-there’s something in your hut!” Gobta came running as soon as he reached close to the village?</p><p><br></p><p>Something in his hut? Did someone attack when he was not present?</p><p><br></p><p>He picked Gobta and flew as fast as he could towards the hut which was in the middle of the village. If there was something in his hut, it could be a danger to the entire village.</p><p><br></p><p>On reaching outside the hut, he saw several people gathered around it, some had makeshift weapons in their hands.</p><p><br></p><p>They all saw him and quickly kneeled.</p><p><br></p><p>Rigurd at the forefront kneeled and apologised.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Sigh…</em> these goblins or rather Hobgoblins were too serious. They needed to chill a bit.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wait here for me. I will check inside.”</p><p><br></p><p>He walked directly into the hut and what he saw there made him rub his eyes in surprise. To verify that he was not dreaming, he tried pinching himself.</p><p><br></p><p>No pain.</p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://Ah….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ah….it</a> was a dream.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“Notice. You have Pain Immunity.”</em></p><p><br></p><p>Eh….Great Sage-san?</p><p><br></p><p>“So this is not a dream?”</p><p><br></p><p><em>“Notice. This is not a dream.”</em></p><p><br></p><p>Wow, Great Sage-san confirmed then it must be real but seriously….</p><p><br></p><p>Was that?</p><p><br></p><p>No way.</p><p><br></p><p>But then again, Silas’ Restaurant could connect to any world.</p><p><br></p><p>Did it?</p><p><br></p><p>He walked shakily towards the door and touched the familiar handle but stopped.</p><p><br></p><p>He needed to take care of the crowd gathered outside.</p><p><br></p><p>He quickly went and addressed the ones gathered outside.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry. This is something that was planned recently by me. Carry on with your own work. I will be out for a while. Oh and ask the dwarves to build a wall and a stronger house around and do not touch this door.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hai, Rimuru-sama.” The Hobgoblins saluted.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Interlude - Rin Tohsaka -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>One and a half months….</p><p><br></p><p>A month and half had passed since the Matou family had suddenly disappeared.</p><p><br></p><p>The mundane authorities didn't even find the destruction until half a month had passed, probably because of the bounded field put in place, the whole place looked like it had been run over by some kind of natural disaster.</p><p><br></p><p>Kirei and her were the first ones to investigate. Someone had put some kind of bounded field over the area and had been staying there for a while.</p><p><br></p><p>The field only broke after they left and they were aware of the whole incident later.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact it was a combination of many barriers of different kinds, one of them being the usual one which the Matous used and two other unrecognised barriers.</p><p><br></p><p>The place looked like it had first been destroyed and then some kind of ritual was done there.</p><p><br></p><p>There were traces of some unknown curses and the worst part was that….they looked old….years even decades old so it was something which the Matou was doing.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly, the entire investigation took a turn.</p><p><br></p><p>Was the place destroyed by an outsider or just due to some failed experiment?</p><p><br></p><p>The curses tainting the place was so bad that it had started affecting the surroundings. The entire place was tainted with extreme malice as if the air itself was tinged with the essence of curses.</p><p><br></p><p>The most horrifying fact was that the curses were extremely similar to the ones during the Fuyuki Fire which she had to report.</p><p><br></p><p>Both the Clocktower and the Church came down upon the place almost instantly, investigating the whole thing minutely.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, even with so many investigations, no results were achieved.</p><p><br></p><p>They couldn’t figure out who was behind the attack or even how they achieved it. All valuables from the house were missing. Every tome, every magical object….everything.</p><p><br></p><p>If she was truthful, she didn’t care about anything that happens to that creep bastard Shinji or the old skeleton of the Zouken family but she was worried about Sakura.</p><p><br></p><p>There were no bodies found on the site but neither Shinji nor Sakura had returned to the school even after a month.</p><p><br></p><p>Just where had they disappeared?</p><p><br></p><p>She was awakened from her thoughts by the bell ringing and went down to check.</p><p><br></p><p>On opening the door she didn’t find anyone except a package and a letter on top. She went outside and found no one.</p><p><br></p><p>Carefully checking the whole package for any spells, she found none and brought it inside</p><p><br></p><p>She opened the letter first.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, no name.”</p><p><br></p><p><em>‘This is a small gift to prepare you for what’s about to come in a year.

I… don’t like resorting to violence… but… sometimes… some people… are better off not existing.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said as I felt disgust well up inside me at the thought of the people who did those things to Sakura.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t think of this as hurting them….think of it as saving the lives of several others who could have been their victims.” Shoko-san comforted her as well.</p><p><br></p><p>“While the principle of the Ryozanpaku dojo is to never kill and I will follow that till I die, there is a saying you should remember in these situations. ‘The World goes to hell when good people do nothing.’ If we knew about that criminal and did not do anything to prevent them from acting again, it would be the same as supporting them in their crimes. You shouldn’t blame yourself, Jou-chan. You did the right thing.” Hayato-san said.</p><p><br></p><p>With enough support from everyone, her mood improved considerably.</p><p><br></p><p>I wonder how things were going on Gojo-san’s side.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Satoru Gojo -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He walked down the path created by his previous attack.</p><p><br></p><p>It was his first time in a different world and… it felt quite enlightening.</p><p><br></p><p>Despite the similar places, the same country, he couldn’t sense the random curses which inhabited his world.</p><p><br></p><p>The only thing which even came close to being a curse was right at the end of the path he was walking towards.</p><p><br></p><p>It wasn’t boring however.</p><p><br></p><p>The energy he could sense from the other end of the town… it made him excited.</p><p><br></p><p>It however wasn't the time to check that part out yet.</p><p><br></p><p>The feeling which he was getting in front of him….was repulsive.</p><p><br></p><p>Just what kind of curse was it?</p><p><br></p><p>He soon found out when he reached the place.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a pit full of worms.</p><p><br></p><p>And in the middle of that was an emancipated body of what looked like a ghoul.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, those badly made zombies from the old horror movies.</p><p><br></p><p>Because there was no way that thing looked anywhere even close to a human.</p><p><br></p><p>“Jeez, and I thought that old guy back at school was ancient. But I guess you feel quite similar to him so it doesn’t matter although in an evil twin manner. I always wonder how it would feel to blow off Tengen-sama but I guess I will have to make do with you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Who are you, insolent curr…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Pest control. We heard there was a worm infestation in this place and now it seems that it was true. Look at you, you fat disgusting worm.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You….”</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t let the old monster speak as he blasted his head.</p><p><br></p><p>The attack wasn’t resisted in the slightest.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, that was unexpected. I expected more.”</p><p><br></p><p>And right at that moment, several worms flew out from the pits and attacked him.</p><p><br></p><p>They obviously didn’t reach near him and he looked at the place where the man’s headless body was standing.</p><p><br></p><p>It was recovering… no, it was getting replaced by worms.</p><p><br></p><p>“So you <em>are</em> a monster. Great. Now Nanami and Yaya-sensei won’t bother me with their glares. But still, you can heal with the help of these worms, so… I will have to try. Let’s get this done.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Lapse: Blue.”</p><p><br></p><p>He created an orb of negative cursed energy right above the worm pit, attracting everything around the area with worms and crushing it.</p><p><br></p><p>The monster sent several spells to attack him but he just dodged them easily.</p><p><br></p><p>This was after all a new world and he didn’t want to risk getting hit by something which his power couldn’t stop.</p><p><br></p><p>The monster wasn’t expecting it and let out a scream like some evil spirit as he sent the sphere of energy high up in the sky.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, the finishing touches.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Reversal: Red.”</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s a perfect hit.</p><p><br></p><p>The attacks merged midair in a purple hue, erasing everything in the surroundings.</p><p><br></p><p>“Remote Hollow Purple. Wow, that actually worked.”</p><p><br></p><p>He heard a whistling sound behind him and turned back to see Kisuke walking out but suddenly stopped and pointed towards a piece of rubble.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hado Number four, Byakurai.”</p><p><br></p><p>White lightning burst out from his hand, tore through the rubble and he heard a shrill sound.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! It was hiding there? I thought I had taken care of all of those.”</p><p><br></p><p>Kisuke walked there and picked it up, looking closely at it. “This one contained a larger part of the soul, second only to the main one, implanted near Sakura-chan’s heart. A good research material.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So, he’s not dead?” He asked, looking at Kisuke dissecting the worm directly.</p><p><br></p><p>“I wouldn’t call this living but yes, he is <em>technically</em> still alive. Although that could end anytime I want. Just give me a minute to check if there was something different about this one.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah, doctors were crazy.</p><p><br></p><p>Just as he was thinking this, the ground in front of him slowly morphed into the form of that old monster.</p><p><br></p><p>“You didn’t die?” he asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“How fascinating? It seems that the main worm was responsible for commanding this figure.” Kisuke said, looking at the figure in front of him. “A puppet of sorts. How long will it be able to command it? Where is it getting all that energy from? So many things, so little time.” He suddenly turned towards him. “Gojo-kun, would you mind assisting me with a small experiment?”</p><p><br></p><p>He raised an eyebrow looking at the mad scientist in front of him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh don’t be suspicious. I just want to test the limits and methods of this old guy. All you need to do is beat him thoroughly.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well if that’s the case….” He cracked his knuckles. “I did promise Shoko to make this painful. He can feel pain, right?”</p><p><br></p><p>In reply Kisuke turned back. “One of the things I intend to figure out.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha great.”</p><p><br></p><p>By then the old monster had recovered and he walked forward.</p><p><br></p><p>He really wanted to vent for a while now.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Silas -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The customers in the shop had mostly left with only a few people left.</p><p><br></p><p>Saitama was getting more depressed with his increased hair fall problem. The guy had become half bald already at such a young age.</p><p><br></p><p>He could barely show emotions.</p><p><br></p><p>The only times when he seemed actually happy was when he was eating.</p><p><br></p><p>With the absence of Mikami and Suzuki, my food was the happiest part of his life.</p><p>‘</p><p>Seriously, even I was missing those two.</p><p><br></p><p>Just what the hell happened to them?</p><p><br></p><p>“So you are planning to increase your training?” Nanami-sensei asked me, breaking me out from my reverie.</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“May I ask why?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I….feel I am not strong enough.” Even in the case of Sakura, I could barely do anything but stand aside and watch.</p><p><br></p><p>It felt so frustrating to be so helpless.</p><p><br></p><p>And now Gojo-san and Kisuke-san are out fixing the problem, a fight I had picked….while I sat here, doing nothing, just waiting for them.</p><p><br></p><p>I was attached to a place which was basically in between who knows how many worlds. There are bound to be people who wouldn’t be as peaceful as my previous customers, like Sakura’s brother….Although there was the System to protect me inside the Restaurant, I couldn’t allow myself to be weak.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I know I’m not from a Jujutsu background or even from that world and I am starting my training very late. And on top of that I’m not even naturally talented. Even Naruto-kun, a kid, has more power than me, so….I want to work hard so that I can help my friends when they need it.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Nanami-sensei was looking oddly at me, making me embarrassed. </p><p><br></p><p>Damn, I must have sounded like those hot blooded shonen protagonists right now with that cringy speech.</p><p><br></p><p>“Silas….Naruto-kun is a unique case. Not everyone can be like him. You shouldn’t compare yourself with him. That said, you are plenty strong yourself. Very strong even but all that potential can only come out through more hard work. Don’t worry, I will increase your lessons.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you, Sensei.” I bowed.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Nanami Kento -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the boy bowing in front of him.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously….just how in the nine hells did he get the idea that <em>he</em> was weak??</p><p><br></p><p>If he was weak then the entire Jujutsu world was worthless.</p><p><br></p><p>Although he didn’t tell the boy about his exact position in the world to not inflate his ego. He was still young and insane amounts of Cursed Energy wouldn’t matter if he cannot control it. Overconfidence when fighting Curses can be one’s greatest enemy.</p><p><br></p><p>He still reassured the kid.</p><p><br></p><p>Naruto Uzumaki was a unique case.</p><p><br></p><p>Two vengeful spirits and whatever that Nine Tailed fox inside him was….such a case was rarer than Six Eyes and Limitless coming together.</p><p><br></p><p>Comparing such an anomaly to himself and saying that he was weak was seriously the dumbest thing he had heard in a while.</p><p><br></p><p>To give him an example, he thought of an idea.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have heard that Sakura-kun also wants to become a Jujutsu Sorcerer. If that’s the case then let’s awaken her Cursed Energy till Gojo and the rest are back.”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the girl who was sitting at the nearby table with Shoko and she nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>They followed him outside as he opened a door.</p><p><br></p><p>Nanami still felt awe when he looked at the sight of his own world outside.</p><p><br></p><p>A Path to different worlds…. </p><p><br></p><p>Shaking his head and clearing his thoughts, he walked out and brought out a cursed tool, a knife from his bag pack.</p><p><br></p><p>He always kept several cursed tools with himself when coming to teach Silas.</p><p><br></p><p>Offering the knife to the girl, he asked her to concentrate on it.</p><p><br></p><p>Shoko and Silas stood a few steps behind, near the door of the Restaurant while Sakura walked a few steps forward, towards the centre of the area.</p><p><br></p><p>They had sealed off this entire underground subway area after the whole Shinjiku debacle after having some discussions with the Government.</p><p><br></p><p>No one was allowed inside and it was even considered haunted.</p><p><br></p><p>On top of that Gojo, Masamichi-sensei and he, all three had covered the place in barriers from top to bottom to isolate this place from the rest of the world after Naruto’s awakening when his barrier almost broke trying to keep the energy from being felt outside.</p><p><br></p><p>Right now, this place was almost as secure as the holding cells at Tokyo Jujutsu High’s Holding Cells.</p><p><br></p><p>As for the girl, he felt bad for her so much that he didn’t even argue with Gojo’s rule breaking this time.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl had obviously gone through a lot and Shoko was correct in saying that such people almost never got to return back to their normal life.</p><p><br></p><p>Instead, giving her the power to protect her would be a much more useful support.</p><p><br></p><p>And due to the things she had experienced, she would be more predisposed to awakening Cursed Energy than others.</p><p><br></p><p>That said….people like Silas Evans and Naruto Uzumaki were exceptions.</p><p><br></p><p>Not everyone can be like them.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe seeing a more….normal Sorcerer would help bring perspective back to Silas.</p><p><br></p><p>Just as he thought this, all the hair on his body stood up as he felt an extreme sense of danger.</p><p><br></p><p>“Get bac!…..” His words couldn’t be completed as he was blown away by a tornado of Cursed Energy.</p><p><br></p><p>His body crashed on the wall of the building as he felt the barrier around the place shatter almost immediately.</p><p><br></p><p>In front of him, Sakura was surrounded by dense shadows, forming a pillar of cursed energy which was rising into the sky.</p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://This….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">This….it</a> was beyond anything he had felt before.</p><p><br></p><p>Hell, even Naruto’s Nine Tailed Fox didn’t feel like this.</p><p><br></p><p>Such power and the….rawness of this power made him slam on the ground, almost losing consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>From the corner of his eyes, he looked at Silas who was channelling his Cursed Energy to keep himself from kneeling.</p><p><br></p><p>The energy was still rising and then the shadows expanded from the pillar, seeping out of the building.</p><p><br></p><p>Such insane Cursed Energy was like a magnet for low level curses. They were being drawn to the place like a moth to flame.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked in horror as within a minute, hundreds of spirits were surrounding the place but when they tried to come to close, they were completely crushed by the power or simply dragged into the shadows and destroyed as they rose up again as shadows and attacked other curses, tearing and devouring them.</p><p><br></p><p>Just what in the world was she?</p><p><br></p><p>He tried to focus, releasing his vow to get an extra boost in his cursed power to get up and stop her when he heard a voice.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sakura, calm down.” Silas shouted.</p><p><br></p><p>He was about to ask him to stay back but before he could say anything, the cursed energy wrecking the entire place disappeared as if it were a dream.</p><p><br></p><p>The pillar of shadow disappeared slowly as Sakura’s form appeared within.</p><p><br></p><p>He almost couldn’t feel any cursed energy inside her.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at Silas and slowly walked towards him.</p><p><br></p><p>They boy quickly went towards her and hugged her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you alright?” Silas then turned towards him. “Was there something wrong with the Knife, Nanami-sensei? And where did those monsters come from?”</p><p><br></p><p>Nanami felt his vision fade as he fell unconscious.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Silas -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I felt Sakura tremble slightly in my arms. “Did I….”</p><p><br></p><p>“You did nothing wrong. There was probably something wrong with the Knife. The same happened with me where I cracked the sword. Don’t worry about it. In fact I haven’t seen that kind of Cursed Energy in anyone. Even Naruto didn’t have this kind of power.  You are awesome Sakura. I am sure you will be a great Jujutsu Sorcerer. Let’s get back quickly. There are more monsters coming here and Nanami-sensei seems to have fainted. This place is unsafe.”</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly picked up Nanami-sensei in one arm and led them back to the Restaurant to see Shoko-san inside.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at us in surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>“What happened?” She asked, quickly coming and checking up on him.</p><p><br></p><p>“There was something wrong with the knife and an accident happened. Monsters swarmed the area and Nanami-sensei fainted. Sakura destroyed several of them and we returned quickly.”</p><p><br></p><p>As I relayed the information, she used her Reversed Curse Technique on him.</p><p><br></p><p>“There was a mild concussion at the back of his head. I healed him. Let him rest for a while and let’s wait for Gojo and the rest to arrive. It might have been an ambush outside.”</p><p><br></p><p>Oh.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Gojo-san seemed to have said something about there being a fight in that area a while back.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Nanami-sensei and then at Sakura.</p><p><br></p><p>Her power was mind blowing. Far above Naruto.</p><p><br></p><p>I was having trouble even standing in her presence.</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, it was understandable as Naruto was still a kid while she was double his age.</p><p><br></p><p>It was only normal that her power would be higher.</p><p><br></p><p>In comparison, my own power….</p><p><br></p><p>Nanami-sensei was probably trying to console me earlier.</p><p><br></p><p>But then again, both Naruto and Sakura were from supernatural worlds while my own world seemed normal….except me.</p><p><br></p><p>It was only normal that they would have more power.</p><p><br></p><p>And yet there were people stronger than her in her world….</p><p><br></p><p>So I would have to train harder.</p><p><br></p><p>Which reminds me that I have to start martial arts lessons with the Ryozanpaku masters too.</p><p><br></p><p>By then Nanami-sensei had woken up but didn’t say anything about the incident. He reassured Sakura that it was not her fault and just said that Gojo-san might be the best teacher for Sakura.</p><p><br></p><p>Gojo-san and Kisuke-san came a few hours later, looking quite happy.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is it done?” Shoko-san asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yup. That old guy was more of a curse than human anymore. Actually, he was quite a lot like Tengen-sama, old, shrivelled and almost a monster.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Gojo!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Chill out. Anyways, he’s dead now. Kisuke found him and we cleared everything related to him. The guy had a lot of stuff.” He looked at Kisuke-san who continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“Books on new kinds of magic, tools, even personal notes on several things. I will leave all of this for Sakura-chan here although I would like to temporarily borrow a few books to study if she doesn’t mind.”</p><p><br></p><p>She easily agreed. In fact, she didn’t even seem to care. Right now, she seemed more relieved than anything else.</p><p><br></p><p>“Great.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So….what’s up? You all look worried?” Gojo-san asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah….actually while you all were away, we had Sakura awaken her Cursed Energy….and well, there was an accident of sorts.”</p><p><br></p><p>He merely raised an eyebrow and looked at Nanami-sensei who kept quiet for a second and then spoke.</p><p><br></p><p>“She is….exceptionally talented.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! That’s quite a praise from you. So….what are you sulking about Nanami-kun?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The barrier outside shattered when she awakened and a lot of curses were attracted. I think we should go out and clear those first.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“The barrier….shattered.” Gojo-san looked surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.” Nanami-sensei nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahahahaha that’s great.”</p><p><br></p><p>Gojo-san began to laugh loudly and then looked at Sakura, giving her a thumbs up, making the girl look embarrassed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Great job. Also don’t worry about the curses outside. I will take care of them. In fact, Silas, you haven’t experienced any combat yet, right? Come on. This will be a great experience.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm Gojo-san….there were hundreds of those monsters. Sakura’s power took care of most of them but there were still a few left. Maybe we should wait here until they are gone?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry. We will be fine. After all….I am the strongest.”</p><p><br></p><p>….this guy….he was quite cocky.</p><p><br></p><p>Although from what I have heard, he did have the ability to call himself as such.</p><p><br></p><p>The strongest sorcerer, Gojo Satoru.</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“In that case, Shoko, teach Sakura-chan some theory while we take Silas out to clear the area.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you mind if I tag along? I have been quite curious about these curses.” Kisuke-san tagged along.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure.”</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I was standing face to face with a grotesque monster, the size of a small car.</p><p><br></p><p>The monster had tentacles and was green in colour. It crawled towards me, faster than I was expecting.</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly dove towards the side and slashed with the dagger in my hand, cutting off the tentacles.</p><p><br></p><p>It let out a shriek and the rest of his tentacles came towards me and I attacked with my knife in return, using the technique I was most comfortable with.</p><p><br></p><p>My chopping techniques.</p><p><br></p><p>It happened without me even realising, due to my habit.</p><p><br></p><p>Before I realised, all of its tentacles were chopped into pieces.</p><p><br></p><p>It retreated quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>I however didn’t back down as I kicked the ground, directly stabbing the knife into its giant single eye.</p><p><br></p><p>The monster crumbled apart.</p><p><br></p><p>I took a deep breath as I felt my heart pounding in my chest.</p><p><br></p><p>I did it.</p><p><br></p><p>Right now, I was outside my Restaurant, fighting the curses which had gathered due to the breaking of the barrier.</p><p><br></p><p>Nanami-sensei, Kisuke-san and Gojo-san were watching over me from a distance and would intervene if I was in any danger.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t get much time as another curse jumped towards me.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Kisuke -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“These curses….how are they born?”</p><p><br></p><p>“From the negative thoughts and emotions of humans.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh. They remind me a lot of hollows.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hollows?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Evil Spirits, basically souls of the dead who have had regrets and linger over and get corrupted. They eat souls to sustain themselves and are extremely dangerous.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Some curses do that too so they might have similarities. Even powerful sorcerers can become curses under certain circumstances.”</p><p><br></p><p>He questioned them as he looked over the owner fight against what was said to be low level curses.</p><p><br></p><p>He could feel the energy which they called Cursed Energy and from what he felt, the owner was very rough in his control although he seemed to be improving very quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>“So….what exactly happened?” Gojo asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sakura….her <a href=\"https://power….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">power….it</a> was beyond anything I had ever experienced. I couldn’t even stand in her presence.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh.” Gojo merely raised an eyebrow.</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t understand Gojo. It was unreal. Even Naruto with all his power seemed almost like a kid in front of her.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No, I believe you. I can’t sense the barrier over Japan right now. It’s damaged severely and the place it was damaged….is right above us.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What?!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Explain about her power.”</p><p><br></p><p>“They seemed to be shadows of some kind, similar to the Zenin’s Shadow Manipulation. She could also kill and devour Curses using her Shadows and….raise them as familiars, similar to….”</p><p><br></p><p>“....Suguru’s power.”</p><p><br></p><p>They became quiet at the mention of the name and he felt a special history behind that name.</p><p><br></p><p>“Her shadows spread over the entire space….and it seemed as if her power was rising every time a curse was devoured.” Nanami continued to explain.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see, that also explains why I am feeling so few curses around the area. It seems that Sakura-chan gobbled up most of them. Although….with the damaged barrier, things are going to change a bit.”</p><p><br></p><p>“They would have detected us too and soon people will be coming here to investigate.”</p><p><br></p><p>“If her power was as great as you said, I doubt they would come here so quickly. But yes, there will be scouts.”</p><p><br></p><p>They again became quiet.</p><p><br></p><p>“But how can someone have that kind of power? It was almost as if….as if she were some kind of a God. The God of all Curses. I felt as if I should kneel in front of her.”</p><p><br></p><p>“She was experimented on by that creep. Who knows what he did? That guy was apparently several hundred years old. We will have to look more into it to understand the reason.” Gojo said, not taking his eyes off Silas who was now fighting more comfortably with curses.</p><p><br></p><p>Kisuke decided to throw in his two cents.</p><p><br></p><p>“It could have something to do with the worms implanted into her. I will look into it. Maybe his notes had something about it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you, Kisuke.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s fine. I am getting a lot out of it too.”</p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://“Well….in\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">“Well….in</a> that case, let’s wrap things here too. Silas has fought enough for today.”</p><p><br></p><p>With that said, Gojo disappeared from the place, appearing beside Silas who was being attacked by a curse and with a single raised finger, a red light burst out, destroying the monster and all the lands behind it.</p><p><br></p><p>Kisuke paid attention to the man because his strength was nothing to scoff about.</p><p><br></p><p>Even in Seireitei, someone like him would be a captain.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe it will give him an idea about the power levels of this world.</p><p><br></p><p>“Gojo-san!” Silas looked surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well done. Now, step back. I will take care of this.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But….there are hundreds of them.”</p><p><br></p><p>There were….but from what Kisuke had sensed, they were barely at low level hollows strength.</p><p><br></p><p>Against someone like Gojo….yes, he will be fine.</p><p><br></p><p>And sure enough, that was the case.</p><p><br></p><p>In less than a minute, all those curses were torn apart and there was not even a scratch on him.</p><p><br></p><p>There were so many interesting things in other worlds.</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>A week had passed since that incident.</p><p><br></p><p>My life was back to normal again. Well, as normal as the life of the owner of an Interdimensional Restaurant could get.</p><p><br></p><p>Sakura was integrating well in the Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>We haven't gone back to her world since then and neither did anyone come from that world.</p><p><br></p><p>And in a way that was for the best.</p><p><br></p><p>We enjoyed this time of peace and quiet.</p><p><br></p><p>Our training was going well.</p><p><br></p><p>Sakura was apparently some kind of genius when it came to Cursed Techniques and Naruto was learning well too although he did have some problems due to his enormous Cursed Energy reserves.</p><p><br></p><p>I on the other hand was getting good at control.</p><p><br></p><p>According to Nanami-sensei, at this rate, I would soon find out my Innate Cursed techniques if I had any.</p><p><br></p><p>Other than that, I trained with the Ryozanpaku masters sometimes.</p><p><br></p><p>I still remembered the scene of Gojo-san ripping every curse in the area with his bare hands.</p><p><br></p><p><em>‘Between Heaven and Earth, I alone am the Honoured One.’</em></p><p><br></p><p>The sheer arrogance in those worlds and yet when knowing what he could do, it didn’t seem out of place somehow.</p><p><br></p><p>Sakura worked as a waitress for the Restaurant and this had reduced a lot of my workload.</p><p><br></p><p>There were some new customers in the Restaurant, a soft spoken calligrapher and a student called Cid Kagenou.</p><p><br></p><p>He really enjoyed the Japanese cuisine the last time he came to the Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>Apparently he had just joined an academy for Knights.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, he was from another magic based world.</p><p><br></p><p>But unlike others, Cid was more interested in my food than other worlds.</p><p><br></p><p>I have been getting better at cooking and with more customers coming in, there were several new dishes I could experiment with.</p><p><br></p><p>The higher level dishes even had the ability to increase the strength of people who ate them but I would need to level up the Restaurant before being able to cook them.</p><p><br></p><p>I finished the last order.</p><p><br></p><p>The customers had been served, so I went and sat down beside him after finishing cooking.</p><p><br></p><p>“So how is school going for you, Cid?” I asked, starting the conversation.</p><p><br></p><p>“Silas-san. School is the same old. I am not in the higher classes so the workload is a bit less but it’s still hard for me.” he rubbed the back of his head.</p><p><br></p><p>“You just got in. I am sure that as long as you work hard, you can get promoted to higher classes easily.” I reassured her.</p><p><br></p><p>“I hope so too.” he smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“On that note, how is your martial arts training going on Silas-kun?” Bang-san asked me.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am just getting started. The masters at Ryozanpaku are good but I haven’t been able to give much time to it due to my schedule.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes yes, training is hard dattebayo.” Naruto took a moment to pick himself from the bowl of ramen and threw in his two cents.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s not easy to become a Legendary Master, brat.” Hayato-san chided, making the kid nod.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am still going to become a Legendary Master. Believe it!” With that said, he dove back to his food.</p><p><br></p><p>Regardless of his words, Naruto trained very hard and the Ryozanpaku masters were extremely impressed with his persistence.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hayato has been telling me that you have good potential. You could try your hand at being a Hero when you get stronger.” Bang-san laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha no no. I will pass. I like my current job.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Too bad.”</p><p><br></p><p>As we were talking with each other, the door to the Restaurant opened and someone entered.</p><p><br></p><p>She was a beautiful girl with long blonde hair with flaming orange tips and red-orange eyes with dilated pupils, and a buxom figure.</p><p><br></p><p>She was wearing a maid costume like those in Maid Cafes I had seen in Akihabara.</p><p><br></p><p>She walked and stopped right in front of us and looked at Naruto as she bowed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you for saving my life. I will be eternally grateful to you for this.” She then turned towards me, leaving the others even more confused. “And thank you for giving me food. It was the best thing I have ever tasted.” She bowed again and there was even a bit of drool on the corner of her lips.</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm….excuse me, but….who are you?” Naruto asked the question which all of us wanted to know the answer to.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, I see. You cannot recognise me in this form. Changing to my true form might be inconvenient in this closed space so I will introduce myself. My name is Tohru and I am a Chaos Dragon.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>She closed her eyes as two deer-like horns popped out on her head and a large green tail came out of her skirt.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am the dragon you saved a while ago and gave food to.”</p><p><br></p><p>We found our mouths opening and closing at the sight.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wow, so cool. Is that the transformation jutsu?” Naruto jumped from his place and looked at her in interest.</p><p><br></p><p>“It is indeed a Transformation Magic.” She nodded. “Naruto-kun is so smart.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ehehehehe.” The kid laughed as he rubbed the back of his head.</p><p><br></p><p>By then some of us had recovered from our shock.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you actually a dragon?” Miu asked, making the dragon girl look at her with an unkind gaze. “Umm, I am Naruto’s elder sister.”</p><p><br></p><p>The gaze turned immediately into a friendly one. “Yes. I am a Chaos Dragon.”</p><p><br></p><p>….Yeah….the name didn’t sound dangerous at all.</p><p><br></p><p>“Would you like to eat something?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, can I?” Drool appeared at the corner of her mouth but she shook her head. “No no. I came here to repay the favour, how can I ask for more.”</p><p><br></p><p>Her stomach growled.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“You can join us for a meal and talk.” I invited.</p><p><br></p><p>After some persuasion she agreed as I went inside to cook while keeping an ear at the conversation.</p><p><br></p><p>I served her some meat like the last time and we watched as she swallowed the whole thing in one bite.</p><p><br></p><p>….she was really a dragon.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, after she finished eating, Hayato-san asked. “So, what do you want to do, Miss Tohru?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I….would like to serve Naruto-kun to repay my debt.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh?”</p><p><br></p><p>Hayato-san and even Naruto tried to persuade her that there was no need for such a thing but she was stubborn.</p><p><br></p><p>By the end, they accepted her as a helping hand at the Dojo. As for repaying me, she would work here part time as a waitress.</p><p><br></p><p>I take it back, my life just became weirder.</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t get it? How do I figure out my Innate Technique? Do I even have one?” I asked, frustrated.</p><p><br></p><p>It had been a month since the dragon maid joined our Restaurant staff and things have become quite interesting since then.</p><p><br></p><p>Tohru is….unique to say the least.</p><p><br></p><p>She lacked the common sense of humans and did some odd things like….cleaning the plates with her tongue or….cooking her own tail which she detoxified….</p><p><br></p><p>There was also the fact that she doesn’t care about other people as long as their names are not Naruto Uzumaki or Silas Evans. She does maintain a very amiable behaviour around people close to us.</p><p><br></p><p>As for others, she saw them as if they were lesser than dirt.</p><p><br></p><p>I had to take time and teach her about customer service and how to act like a proper waitress.</p><p><br></p><p>Sakura helped and for some reason I get the feeling that Tohru was shit scared of Sakura. She never spoke about it so I didn’t pry either.</p><p><br></p><p>And coming to Sakura….the girl was a genius in Jujutsu.</p><p><br></p><p>She could use almost any kind of Cursed Techniques at a glance.</p><p><br></p><p>Her power was using Shadows but the scariest part of the power was to devour curses. By doing so, she couldn’t just summon them later on as Shikigami but also get an increase in power.</p><p><br></p><p>They tested her and both her power and skills were enough to qualify her as a Special Class from the very start.</p><p><br></p><p>The only thing which she didn’t know was Domain Expansion because that was something she needed to figure out by herself.</p><p><br></p><p>Although she wasn’t interested in fighting and was more interested in the Reversed Curse Techniques of Shoko-san.</p><p><br></p><p>She wanted to heal and help others out of their pain.</p><p><br></p><p>I personally think that goal was beautiful.</p><p><br></p><p>Currently, she was waiting for me to catch up and till then, she studied the books Kisuke-san had….borrowed from her home.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Naruto had awakened the same type of chains as one of the Spirits haunting him. They could seal the Cursed Energy of others and could even bypass cursed techniques.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, both of them were some kind of cheat existences.</p><p><br></p><p>Meanwhile, here I was….trying to figure out if I had any Innate Techniques of my own.</p><p><br></p><p>“Naruto, Sakura and you are from three different worlds. From what Kisuke and Shoko have found, Sakura’s and Naruto’s worlds had bloodline specific magic while we don’t even know if yours had magic of any kind. So they might be more….predisposed to awaken their Innate Techniques. As for you, maybe it will manifest in a while as your body gets used to the Cursed Energy you have. No need to get frustrated. There are still a lot of things you can do without Innate Techniques.” Nanami-sensei explained.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. He was right.</p><p><br></p><p>I let out a sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>“I was just getting frustrated due to not making any progress.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Maybe you need a break. You are making very good progress in your control. I will ask Gojo to take over and teach you how to use a Simple Domain if possible.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A Domain?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I personally think you can do that.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh? I am not much of a combatant though. I wanted to learn Magic for protection. Maybe something like the Reverse Cursed technique would be good for me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Reverse Curse Technique is not something I am proficient in. You will have to ask Gojo or Shoko for it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay.”</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, how is your Martial Arts training going?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s good. The masters are happy with my progress.” They actually were. With the combined effect of my special food and their training, I was getting decently strong.</p><p><br></p><p>“You should train. The situation outside is a bit complicated. The number of curses has started increasing drastically, so much so that Gojo has to work out almost full time to keep them in check. And the worst part is that all of them seem to be attracted to this area. We are keeping a guard outside so you don’t need to worry. We expect the barrier over the country to be repaired soon and the number of curses will be reduced.”</p><p><br></p><p>We talked out a bit and then he left.</p><p><br></p><p>Touma and the Masters came and I went back to prepare their orders.</p><p><br></p><p>Kensei was instructing Touma while he was practising his punches.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly, I heard a smashing sound of someone hitting on the wall and overturning the tables and quickly came out.</p><p><br></p><p>People were surrounding a black haired guy who was slumped against the wall. He was wearing a weird black and golden coloured robe with a white shawl-like cover and looked like a scholar from the middle ages.</p><p><br></p><p>Touma was already on his knees, apologising to the guy while Hayato checked up on him.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy on the other hand probably had a broken jaw or something and was bleeding from his mouth as he looked at the blood on his hand in shock.</p><p><br></p><p>It took me a short moment to know what had happened. Touma, who was practising his punches, was hit by Kensei on his knees to correct his posture. He slipped and punched the guy who had just entered the shop, sending him flying and crashing into the wall.</p><p><br></p><p>“I… I’m not healing?” The guy looked in shock as if he couldn’t believe it. He checked it again and a few more times before I saw some tears in his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Saitama, get the first aid kit. It’s on the second floor. Check the storeroom.” I instructed as I helped the guy stand up and tried to take him to a seat.</p><p><br></p><p>He however got up and went straight to Touma. I saw Kensei tense up slightly but what happened next stunned all of us out of our minds. He bowed down and thanked Touma.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you. You have done me the greatest favour of my life.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Saitama who had returned with the First Aid Kit whispered into my ears. “Is he, you know… one of those masochist weirdos?”</p><p><br></p><p>… The worst part was that I had no idea what to say.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am sorry, I didn’t mean to hit you, Mr?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Zeref. My name is Zeref Dragneel. You don’t have to feel bad.I don’t know how you did it but you have helped me and for that, I will be eternally grateful.”</p><p><br></p><p>At this point all of us were confused. The guy sensed it and explained to us.</p><p><br></p><p>“I was cursed. You just somehow broke my curse. Please don’t feel bad about it.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ohhh.</p><p><br></p><p>Ohhhh. That made sense. Touma’s power negation actually removed his curse.</p><p><br></p><p>And being a budding expert on curses, I enquired about his story.</p><p><br></p><p>The people around were shocked for a moment before they gathered around the new guy Zeref to know his story.</p><p><br></p><p>Zeref Dragneel explained a bit about himself.</p><p><br></p><p>His family was killed in a dragon attack when he was still a kid. Both his parents and a younger brother died.</p><p><br></p><p>I saw Tohru shifting awkwardly in her place at the mention of the incident.</p><p><br></p><p>When he grew up, he learned magic and started researching ways to bring back the dead and invented a type of magic which broke some laws.</p><p><br></p><p>This caused him to get cursed by the God of Death.</p><p><br></p><p>I felt a chill down my spine.</p><p><br></p><p>To be cursed by a God….seriously….</p><p><br></p><p>It seems that his world was far more dangerous than the ones I knew of.</p><p><br></p><p>On the other hand, I felt pity for the man.</p><p><br></p><p>Zeref seemed like a very kind person.</p><p><br></p><p>Losing his entire family might be a shock for anyone and this guy was just trying to get back his family.</p><p><br></p><p>While trying to break taboos is bad, this kind of curse was just too cruel.</p><p><br></p><p>Especially for someone like Zeref, who wanted to live a peaceful life, that kind of a curse….was probably the worst thing which could happen to him.</p><p><br></p><p>And it wasn’t even the worst part yet.</p><p><br></p><p>Due to the deaths the curse had caused, he was regarded a Black Wizard and shunned by the world.</p><p><br></p><p>And then, after over hundreds of years of living a lonely life, he gets a lover and even she was afflicted by the same curse due to using some magic to save a friend of hers.</p><p><br></p><p>I suddenly felt annoyed at the God.</p><p><br></p><p>This explained why he was so grateful to have the curse removed from him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Zeref, I don’t know how it worked but if you want, I can help your lover too. My power is to negate the powers of those I touch. I can try using this and see if it works.” Touma offered. “I still don’t know the exact range of my powers so I can’t say anything for sure.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man’s eyes widened slightly and he nodded. “Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. While not much, I have been studying about purifying curses too. I don’t know if we can do anything against a curse from a God but I assure you that we will do our best.” I reassured the guy too.</p><p><br></p><p>He bowed deeply at us.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you. I cannot thank you all enough for the favour you have done me.”</p><p><br></p><p>The atmosphere soon became calmer as we all settled down. </p><p><br></p><p>I served the guy some food to celebrate him being free of the curse which had hounded him for years….probably centuries.</p><p><br></p><p>“But that really scared me. I thought that the kid messed up.” Kensei laughed and we joined in awkwardly while I gave Touma some water.</p><p><br></p><p>The other customers explained to Zeref about the shop while I took a seat nearby to hear the stories.</p><p><br></p><p>“Still I didn’t expect this kind of place to exist. A restaurant connecting several worlds and that too run by a demon. In my world, Demons are mostly cruel and lean towards destruction and chaos. So to see one who is this <a href=\"https://different….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">different….it</a> is really a surprise.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Say what?”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Yaga Masamichi -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He stood in front of the higher ups from the Jujutsu High however, today, the situation had changed.</p><p><br></p><p>Back then, he was expecting an execution due to the mess at Shibuya and Gojo getting sealed.</p><p><br></p><p>It was not a secret how much these bastards wanted to get their hands on his techniques.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, they had even announced his house arrest and that was the main reason why he had to run away with Gojo.</p><p><br></p><p>But ever since the day Sakura had awakened….</p><p><br></p><p>He still felt chills recalling the incident.</p><p><br></p><p>Who would have thought that the girl they had helped would be <em>that</em> strong? Even from so far away, he could feel the enormous Cursed Energy of that girl.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the fact that her awakening and casually releasing her Cursed Energy had almost shattered the entire countrywide barrier over Japan was a terrifying thought.</p><p><br></p><p>And she could control curses and even become stronger, not to mention her incredible talent which surpassed even Yuta.</p><p><br></p><p>They had all devoted all their efforts to find out the reason behind it, and with some help from Kisuke Urahara, the man from a different world, they found some clues in the notes of the madman whom Gojo had killed.</p><p><br></p><p>The history of the Matou or rather Makiri family and that monster Zouken….</p><p><br></p><p>How Sakura was actually adopted and had the Matou blood forced on her, of all the atrocities she had to go through for the twisted pleasure and goals of that madman, the Grail Wars and finally about the corrupted grail manifesting the spirit of a real God.</p><p><br></p><p>A God.</p><p><br></p><p>Those madmen actually tried to mess with the spirit of an actual God and not just any God but the King of Daemons who bore the six billion curses of the world,  the source of All the World's Evil, Angra Mainyu.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly a twenty finger Sukuna felt tame.</p><p><br></p><p>There was however a ray of hope which was Sakura’s ability to control it.</p><p><br></p><p>They had hypothesised several things and found out that the whole reason for this was based in the Matou trait of Absorption.</p><p><br></p><p>Although they had removed most if not all of the tainted grail from her, the girl’s body had absorbed the power and coming to their world and awakening her Cursed Energy was the final trigger for the insane event.</p><p><br></p><p>In all, it was several, almost impossible facts coming together to work in just the right way to give the girl her powers.</p><p><br></p><p>Gojo had verified that she was not being possessed and the fact that she practically followed every word of the shop owner Silas, they considered her safe.</p><p><br></p><p>It was one of the reasons why they were investing so much effort to train her to control her powers.</p><p><br></p><p>In the past month and half, no one had gone there to check the source of that power.</p><p><br></p><p>They were too busy fending off the curses which had started increasing at an unbelievable rate. For now, they had decided to put aside their scheming and work together to get through this crisis.</p><p><br></p><p>Many were of the belief that some old Curse had ascended but the fact that the power was not felt after made people confused.</p><p><br></p><p>That, coupled with Gojo’s return and specifically guarding the area had deterred these people from taking any action against him and the students.</p><p><br></p><p>And Satoru took this opportunity to lay out some conditions for his continued services since they had already declared him as a Curse User before. So if they wanted his help, they must pay the price.</p><p><br></p><p>“Has that brat gone crazy?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Who does he think he is?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you think that the Jujutsu world will bow to your wishes?”</p><p><br></p><p>“You are colluding with him too?”</p><p><br></p><p>As expected, there was commotion at the demand.</p><p><br></p><p>“Arrest this man!” Someone commanded.</p><p><br></p><p>He let out a sigh inwardly.</p><p><br></p><p>At this time, a voice sounded in the place.</p><p><br></p><p>“See, I told you Sensei. There was no use. I should have directly erased them back then. Even when under such a condition, they still think more of themselves than the rest of the world.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Gojo Satoru! Are you rebelling?” One of them shouted, being at the end of their wits.</p><p><br></p><p>“Rebelling? Hahahahahaha that’s the funniest thing I have heard in such a long time.”</p><p><br></p><p>Satoru faced them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Rebelling against whom? You people?” He walked towards them. “Who exactly are you people? Just a bunch of living fossils too far beyond their expiry date.” He mocked. “Oh yes. I remember.You people are the higher ups of the Jujutsu community. So scary. But then again, I am a Curse User, right? So we are enemies. Why are we even arguing then? Let’s get this over with.” he turned back. “Will you be staying, Sensei?”</p><p><br></p><p>He let out a sigh and walked out and a moment later, blasts occurred inside the room and Satoru walked out.</p><p><br></p><p>“The trash has been cleaned. Please choose some proper ones next time. I recommend you and old man Gakuganji.” With that said, he just disappeared from the scene.</p><p><br></p><p>A few minutes later, several of the students came rushing at the scene.</p><p><br></p><p>He took a deep breath and walked forward to take control of the situation.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Interlude - Sukuna’s Isekai Adventures -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He threw one of the books aside in anger.</p><p><br></p><p>Useless.</p><p><br></p><p>Everything left here was useless.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe the only good thing was in the underground….the black mud which attracted him like nothing else.</p><p><br></p><p>Even just touching the mud made his power increase by a bit but the increase was not stable.</p><p><br></p><p>So he tried to research more about what it was but there wasn’t anything left in this accursed place that could tell him.</p><p><br></p><p>On the other hand, the boy was somehow binding himself onto his soul. Was it his Innate Technique?</p><p><br></p><p>If this goes on, he will have a harder time controlling him in the future. Even now, the resistance by the boy increases.</p><p><br></p><p>He needed to find a safer body to explore this world.</p><p><br></p><p>A whole new world.</p><p><br></p><p>He couldn’t help but smile.</p><p><br></p><p>What a discovery.</p><p><br></p><p>And that Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>The owner of that place….he could travel to all these worlds.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly, he had a plan. The ideal vessel for his soul….the Restaurant owner, Silas.</p><p><br></p><p>Too bad that place was protected by Satoru Gojo right now and the current him was not in a state to fight him or he would have slaughtered everyone of them when he had spied them destroying his fingers.</p><p><br></p><p>But now, with his fingers destroyed, he needed to find other ways to strengthen himself from this world before he could attempt such a thing.</p><p><br></p><p>Until then, he couldn’t go near that place. Not to mention, there were lots of dangers in this world as well.</p><p><br></p><p>He could sense that enormous aura on the other side of the town.</p><p><br></p><p>So, what should he do?</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the black mud in front of him and then with a smile, stabbed his heart, plucking and throwing it out.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy inside his mind started to shout in panic at the scene.</p><p><br></p><p>Appearing in the shared mindscape, he smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Shut up and listen to me if you want a way to live.”</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am back with another chapter of the ‘Isekai Restaurant’.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Zouken was toyed with by both Gojo and Kisuke.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>A fitting death according to me for such a guy.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sakura awakens and the JJK world is in chaos.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Gojo finally decided to take things into his own hands.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>And so did Sukuna.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Silas is still trying to figure out what his Innate Cursed technique is.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>On the other hand, Zeref is here and Silas’ life is going to get turned upside down.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The dragon maid is also in the house.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>And amidst all this, Shadow-sama blends in as usual.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The story is picking up pace finally.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>We will see what is happening in other words next.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Look forward to the next chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br><br></p>",

You shouldn’t be afraid to ask for help. We might be able to lend a hand.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I… it’s…” I let out a sigh and explained to him the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>“Please… you all don’t know him.”</p><p><br></p><p>“True. I might not know him but, we will never know if we can succeed if we don’t even try.”</p><p><br></p><p>“He is not a human… that man… he is a monster… a demon.”</p><p><br></p><p>She stuttered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright alright no need to get so worked up. It just so happens that I’m somewhat of a monster slayer myself.” Gojo-san said, summoning a red orb on the top of his finger. “So why don’t you tell us something so that we might be able to help you?”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at him with some hope in her eyes but her eyes turned to the same dead ones again.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. You don’t have to tell us anything. Just hold on a minute.” The guy went outside the door and before we could even count till tell, he returned with a brown haired brown eyed woman. She had a mole under her right eye and was wearing a white lab coat like a doctor.<br><br></p><p>Well, ‘with’ might not be the correct word to describe it since he was carrying her like a luggage bag. “Alright, introductions first. She is my friend Shoko. She is a doctor. Let her take a look at you first.” He said.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>I was not the only one confused at the scene.</p><p><br></p><p>But the doctor herself was not even fazed. She looked as if she was used to this situation.</p><p><br></p><p>Was it not the first time?</p><p><br></p><p>That was a scary thought.</p><p><br></p><p>Moreover, where was she that he brought her back so fast?</p><p><br></p><p>It wasn’t even half a minute.</p><p><br></p><p>“Shoko, this is Sakura-chan and this is Silas-kun. She needs help. Please see what she needs and help her out.”</p><p><br></p><p>He lay her on the floor and spoke as if it was a normal day to day thing.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl stood up and dusted her clothes easily. “You disappear for so long that many people think you were sealed off and now you bring me here, ask me to check her up without even explaining what’s going on… at least this verifies that you are the real Satoru.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright alright, let’s leave these topics for later.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Just like always.” She rolled her eyes and walked up to Sakura-san and then looked at us. “Do you have any spare rooms?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah yes. Right this way.” I showed them to one of the rooms upstairs and left them.</p><p><br></p><p>“So… what’s the situation?” Gojo-san asked me when I got back.</p><p><br></p><p>I let out a sigh and explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you punch him properly?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I think I broke his nose.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Good. Next time aim to break his jaw. Let’s add some martial arts to your training too. We don’t know what kind of Innate Technique you might have so it’s better if you master what you can at first. The Martial Arts teachers from Ryozanpaku would be glad to help.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay. I’ll ask them for some pointers.” I did not deny the suggestion.</p><p><br></p><p>At that moment, the door to the Restaurant opened again.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a new guy.</p><p><br></p><p>He was a tall, lean man with light skin and grey eyes. He had messy and light-blond hair, with strands framing the sides of the face and hanging between his eyes, and he had chin stubble. He was wearing a dark green samue. Over this, he had a black haori, which sported a white diamond pattern.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps the most eye-catching things about him were the traditional Japanese wooden sandals and a striped dark green and white bucket hat.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Ara, was there always a restaurant in this place?\" He asked, looking around before taking a seat.</p><p><br></p><p>\"What would you like to eat, Sir?\" I asked, showing him the menu.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at me for a moment and ordered a few dishes.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Your order will be done in a moment.\"</p><p><br></p><p>I went inside to cook.</p><p><br></p><p>During this time, a few other people appeared in the Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>It was the Ryozanpaku group with both Naruto and Touma.</p><p><br></p><p>They placed their orders and started talking among themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>A moment later even Nanami-sensei and Principal Yaga entered and I got busy with all their orders.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>– Satoru Gojo –</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He watched Silas cooking while the rest sat on a table around him.</p><p><br></p><p>\"We were able to get some information on some fingers of Sukuna. How about on your side?” Yaga-sensei asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“That volcano head had some. I chased them to finish them off. Especially that curse, Mahito who was fighting Yuji and Todo. He managed to escape but I got a few others including the volcano head. They had quite a stock.”</p><p><br></p><p>“How many?”</p><p><br></p><p>He brought a bag from his side and opened it.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ten!”</p><p><br></p><p>“You got ten fingers!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha awesome right?”</p><p><br></p><p>Just then Touma came to greet him, followed by a young boy and a girl.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are these your friends, Nii-san?” The boy asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“These are Gojo-san, Principal Masamichi and Nanami-san. They are teachers in the Magic Academy in their world.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Magic! Really, can we learn it?” The boy jumped up with a bright look in his eyes. He turned towards them and repeated again. “Can I really learn magic?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Naruto, be polite. I’m sorry for him.” The girl beside him bowed.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s fine. Kids are often excited when they find out about this. Reality is not often as fun. Very few people have an aptitude for Jujutsu.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I can learn it. I‘m a Ninja and I am going to be a Legendary Master one day dattebayo.” The boy explained at the top of his voice.</p><p><br></p><p>He reminded him a lot of one of his students.</p><p><br></p><p>Yuji.</p><p><br></p><p>“So you are the ninja kid Silas-kun was talking about. I wonder what your world looks like.” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s awesome ttebayo. Ninja techniques are awesome. I learned a technique in the Academy too. Although that crappy Bunshin Technique is still not good, I made one of my own.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hoh. Can you show us?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright then. Be careful. I even won against Kensei-sensei with this technique.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha, don’t worry. I think I can handle it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay then. Here I go.”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy made handsigns.</p><p><br></p><p>To his surprise, a cloud of smoke burst out around him.</p><p><br></p><p>And what appeared in front of them was…</p><p><br></p><p>“Naruto! Change back right now.” The blonde girl beside him shouted, embarrassed.</p><p><br></p><p>Touma had his eyes covered.</p><p><br></p><p>Beside him Nanami and Yaga-sensei were still registering the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahahahaha that’s an awesome technique.” he gave the boy a thumbs up.</p><p><br></p><p>He returned back to his normal form with a huge smile on his face. “See. I’m awesome right. I call this my Sexy Jutsu. I can do even more things.”</p><p><br></p><p>He made the same handsigns again and this time he transformed into Gojo himself.</p><p><br></p><p>This made him raise an eyebrow.</p><p><br></p><p>He pulled up the glasses and looked at the boy and his eyes widened when he looked closer.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahahaha you are stunned right! I know I’m awesome. So, will you teach me Magic now?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Naruto, stop causing trouble.” The girl bowed again. “I am really sorry for my little brother’s behaviour.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry. It was really interesting to see a new form of Power. To answer his question, I think Naruto-kun might have some insane potential to learn Jujutsu. Dare I say, equal to or surpassing even my own.” he added, making Nanami drop his spoon in shock as he looked up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Satoru, are you being serious?” Yaga-sensei asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yup. In terms of raw potential, he might be the <em>best</em> I have seen yet.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Even more than…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. But there is a difference, unlike him, Naruto-kun is more like Yuta and Yuji. Not that he is weak himself but with the combined power of both sides… it makes those two look like children.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Is something the matter?” The girl asked. “I’m Miu Furinji by the way.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Nothing Miu-chan. We just think Naruto-kun here is extremely suitable for learning Jujutsu. Can we maybe talk to your Guardian?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh? Ah sure.”</p><p><br></p><p>She led them to the table of the martial arts masters on another table and introduced themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>“So you are the ones Touma told us about? My name is Hayato Furinji. What can I do for you?”</p><p><br></p><p>Yaga-sensei took on the lead and explained to them about the Jujutsu world. Then before deciding anything, they send the children aside.</p><p><br></p><p>“Your grandson… is someone with the most potential we have ever seen with Jujutsu. We think if guided well, he could become the best Jujutsu sorcerer ever.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm… but from what I can understand, it will also throw him into constant violence and killing, dealing with negative things all the time. I am sorry but I cannot in my right consciousness allow that to happen.” The man replied.</p><p><br></p><p>There was no hesitation in his reply and for that he could respect the old man.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sir, we only exorcise the curses who are a danger to the human species. And with Naruto’s potential, he can become one of the best, the strongest Jujutsu sorcerer in the whole world. Don’t you think you should give him a chance to explore this side of his?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then we will wait until he is at an age where he can understand the implications of such a thing before pushing him into such a danger. I adopted him, brought him out of the place where he lived before only so that we could provide him with a good life. Doing this is a complete opposite of our intentions and promises made to him.”</p><p><br></p><p>He took a deep breath.</p><p><br></p><p>“I had heard the story from Silas-kun. The Nine Tailed Fox right?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. There was such a being in his world and it left a  huge impact on his life. From what we could gather, he was born on the same day as the attack of the fox and many people thought he was the incarnation of the fox itself due to his whisker-like birthmarks. He was discriminated against and treated like a monster by those mindless people and no one did anything to stop them. It’s an unfortunate part of the kid’s life. So please try to understand my decision. We just want him to experience a normal childhood.” Hayato explained.</p><p><br></p><p>At this point even Yaga-sensei and Nanami became quiet.</p><p><br></p><p>This is where he decided to intervene.</p><p><br></p><p>“I respect your intentions.” he said and he was completely sincere. Even Yaga-sensei and Nanami looked at him in confusion. “But there is a saying, ‘the path to hell is paved with good intentions.’”</p><p><br></p><p>The man’s eyes narrowed. “What are you trying to say, young man?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Please don’t misunderstand my words. I am not trying to insult your intentions. It’s just that you people don’t seem to understand his situation properly. They didn’t treat him like a monster just because he was born on the same day… it was because that monster is sealed inside him.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“WHAT!”</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone in the room was shaken at the reveal.</p><p><br></p><p>“That Nine Tailed Fox… is actually sealed inside your adoptive grandson and they might have known about it. Maybe the one who supposedly defeated it, couldn’t actually defeat it and just sealed it inside a newborn child. The whisker marks might have been an influence of this. That said the seal is strong but I would still suggest that you start him on learning more about his powers. Oh, and keep Touma from touching his stomach under any circumstances. What happens to you all would be a matter of concern later but the kid would probably explode first.”</p><p><br></p><p>Hayato looked to his side to a master in a white martial arts uniform who got up and left instantly.</p><p><br></p><p>“How sure are you about it? Why should I trust you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I saw it myself. As for trusting me, I can teach him to dive into his consciousness and see the fox for himself. He won’t be harmed.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man became quiet and looked down in thought. “I… need some time to think.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t need to worry about it. He can stay with you and only come with us to learn about Jujutsu. In fact, he can even learn with Silas-kun if you are uncomfortable leaving him with us.” he offered.</p><p><br></p><p>The man closed his eyes. “Will there be any danger to him?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Just as much as learning Martial Arts. We have doctors who can even restore lost limbs so you don’t need to worry about any accidental damages. Oh, speak of the Devil, there she is?” He looked at Shoko who was coming towards them with a serious and enraged look on her face.</p><p><br></p><p>Oh boy, that’s rare.</p><p><br></p><p>Shoko is not someone to get angry so easily.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sensei, I request for permission to take action against a Curse User and I want to do it personally.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sensei merely raised an eyebrow. “That’s rare. But denied. You are not a fighter.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It can be someone else doing the fighting. I just want their lives to end by my hands.” She gritted her teeth hard.</p><p><br></p><p>He suddenly remembered what she was called to do. “Is something wrong with Sakura-chan?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Those bastards….” She took a deep breath and explained what she had found in her body.</p><p><br></p><p>The crest worms and what they could do, the probably soul in the worm near her heart, other things and the signs of years of abuse.</p><p><br></p><p>“She didn’t even flinch when I cut open her body to examine the worm. She was so used to pain. They have been torturing her for years… possibly since she was just a kid, maybe even….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Was it done by her family?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>The faces of everyone in the place darkened. Even more for the Ryozanpaku masters, who were releasing some kind of pressure too.</p><p><br></p><p>There were many things they had seen as a Jujutsu sorcerer.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a field which messed up someone and that’s why he was fine with Hayato-san wanting to protect his grandson.</p><p><br></p><p>But even then, there were things which just crossed the lines.</p><p><br></p><p>This event reminded him of some past events.</p><p><br></p><p>His fight against and his failure to protect someone.</p><p><br></p><p>He took a deep breath.</p><p><br></p><p>“The bastard was probably preparing her as a vessel of some kind to occupy her body. I couldn’t even remove the worms because they were tied to some kind of construction in her body, a nerve of some kind and it even extends to her soul. I am not sure if I would hurt her. Moreover, I think if one of them is removed first, others might try to hurt her too, so we need to remove all of them at the same time just to be safe, especially the one in her heart.”</p><p><br></p><p>Right at this time, Silas-kun came there with the orders.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is something the matter? Is Sakura-chan alright, doctor?”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Silas -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The whole group looked at me suddenly and I felt odd being stared at by so many people all at once.</p><p><br></p><p>“Silas-kun, what can you tell us about Sakura-chan’s circumstances?” the doctor asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm? She comes to the Restaurant often but just sits by herself and watches everyone. It’s just that she always looks… so hollow. Her eyes I mean. Today, she came back and she looked even worse so I offered her some food and that’s when that guy came in. He was talking rudely with her so I went to stop him but it turns out that he was her brother. When he grabbed her, I saw that there were bruises, like someone hitting her on her arm so I stopped her. When the guy attacked me, I punched him and threw him back. I think I broke his nose.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You should have blasted his head off. Scum like those…” She clenched her fist. “I need to smoke. Is there a place where I can?”</p><p><br></p><p>I pointed out towards the door.</p><p><br></p><p>“You can smoke after we fix this problem.” Nanami-sensei said.</p><p><br></p><p>“What problem?” I asked him.</p><p><br></p><p>He sighed and explained the situation and blood drained off of my face.</p><p><br></p><p>“With the supernatural side involved, I can see why she didn’t think the police could help her.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you think anyone could help her?” Principal Masamichi asked.</p><p><br></p><p>She shook her head. “No humans. Souls are not an easy thing to mess with. Maybe that Cursed Spirit who made those cursed humans could as their souls were changed but I don’t know of any other. My suggestion is to seal those creatures and then find people who can remove them later.”</p><p><br></p><p>At that time, a voice came from behind us.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did someone say souls? I might know a thing or two about them?” The man wearing a hat and clogs who was sitting and talking with Naruto all this time spoke and the whole room turned towards him.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are?” Principal Masamichi asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hello, my name is Kisuke Urahara and I am a humble candy shop owner. I just happened to have found out about this Restaurant’s speciality from your talks and these two helpful kids. Pardon me but I just heard that you were concerned about someone’s soul? Coincidentally, I have had some experience working with souls and purging evil spirits myself. Do you mind if I lend a hand?” he asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“A candy shop owner? I am sorry but we need specialists for this job. Not anyone with slight knowledge of spirits can help out with surgeries of this level.” The doctor said, slightly irritated.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy covered his face with his fan and laughed. “Oh my. I am getting the feeling that I am being underestimated somewhat. Then….how about I prove my skill to you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“And how exactly will you do that? What do you want in return?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“That gentleman over there has something with souls in that bag of his. How about I use one of them as examples? If it’s just removing the souls from them or purifying them it’s an easy thing to do. As for what I want? Studying that thing and knowing some things about your Jujutsu world would already be enough of a payment.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the gentleman, Gojo-san who looked back at him and then just brought what looked like a….</p><p><br></p><p>“Is that a finger?”</p><p><br></p><p>“A cursed object.” he threw it to the man. “Let’s see what you can do.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Here?” The man caught the finger and asked while taking a look at the finger.</p><p><br></p><p>“Will this be alright, Silas-kun?” Gojo-san asked me.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at them both. This was literally a matter of Sakura-chan’s life and death.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure. I can take care of any damage here.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Great. In that case let me run a few tests on this thing. Still, what a horrible design. A finger, really?” He spoke as he sat down on one of the tables and placed the finger in front of him and placed hand over it.</p><p><br></p><p>I could see different types of lights shine from under his hands.</p><p><br></p><p>“How interesting. Someone divided a piece of someone’s soul, a twisted and corrupted soul, almost like a hollow in this finger. Was this the body of the original owner?” he asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That would explain why it could be so easily contained inside. Anyways, I assume that it was designed so that the user could somehow take over other people’s bodies, should they by chance eat one of the fingers. How odd, they should have designed it in an edible shape if they wanted someone to eat a piece. I can’t see someone wanting to swallow someone’s finger whole. But coming back to the story. Once ingested, the soul would take over the host’s body and maybe then it could seek out the rest of the pieces of itself and reform back.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, it seems you are not a phony after all.” The doctor said, “So, can you exorcise it by removing the soul?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh yes. That won’t be a problem. Do you want me to do it now?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>The Jujutsu Academy people looked at each other and nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright.” Principal Masamichi nodded and we watched as he raised his hand.</p><p><br></p><p><em>\"Ye lord! Mask of blood and flesh, all creation, flutter of wings, ye who bears the name of Man! Inferno and pandemonium, the sea barrier surges, march on to the south, Shakkahō!\"</em></p><p><br></p><p>A red orb formed on his palm and struck the finger creating a small explosion.</p><p><br></p><p>The finger was obliterated instantly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Amazing!” I heard someone whisper.</p><p><br></p><p>Was it?</p><p><br></p><p>I mean Touma could have touched it and it would have disappeared.</p><p><br></p><p>Was there really a need for all that light show?</p><p><br></p><p>“So, can I see the patient now?” He asked, looking at the doctor. “By the way, the furniture of this place is really something. There isn’t one scratch on it.”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>They both went upstairs to the room where Sakura was staying. This time however Gojo-san followed them as well.</p><p><br></p><p>We waited outside for a while. Even the Ryozanpaku teachers stayed there with me, looking worried.</p><p><br></p><p>They left the room after a while and Gojo-san gave me a thumbs up. “She’s safe.”</p><p><br></p><p>We let out a sigh of relief.</p><p><br></p><p>The doctor was still healing her so the next one to come out was Kisuke-san who was carrying a bag with him with something clearly moving inside. “These are some interesting test subjects. It could probably keep me occupied for a while.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Just what kind of Candy Shop owner are you?</p><p><br></p><p>Still, I bowed deeply in front of him. “Thank you for helping Sakura-chan.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha don’t mind. I’m getting something great out of this too. Who would have known that such a magical place existed? Other worlds... I haven’t been so excited in a while.”</p><p><br></p><p>A few minutes later the doctor came out and looked at us. “She is completely healed right now and just needs some rest. Let her sleep.”</p><p><br></p><p>With that said, we all went down to continue our conversation.</p><p><br></p><p>“That was really something, Kisuke-san. Your technique almost felt like a domain of some kind. Bankai, was it?” Gojo-san asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“The Reverse Cursed Technique which Miss Doctor over here used was far more impressive. Is it something others can learn too?”</p><p><br></p><p>Both of them began to talk with each other like old friends.</p><p><br></p><p>“They are getting along together too well for my comfort.” Nanami-sensei whispered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Because from what I have seen of the guy, he’s the same as Gojo in terms of personality.” Shoko-san said, walking out of the place while bringing out a pack of cigarettes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sigh… there are more like him in the world or other worlds?”</p><p><br></p><p>What came after was Touma destroying the rest of the fingers.</p><p><br></p><p>At this, even Kisuke-san looked at the boy dumbfounded.</p><p><br></p><p>I got a hefty payment for acting as a middleman.</p><p><br></p><p>Another thing happened that day.</p><p><br></p><p>Hayato-san talked to me about including Naruto in our Jujutsu training. It seems that Naruto was joining the place as a new student.</p><p><br></p><p>He even told me about the supposed special case of Naruto and asked me to take care of him. Apparently, watching the Jujutsu Academy teachers trying so hard to help Sakura-chan earned them his trust.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, with everything taken care of, Gojo-san and Nanami-sensei stayed behind to look over our training.</p><p><br></p><p>The doctor Shoko-san also stayed behind to look after Sakura.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have talked with Hayato-san and you will be going there for some basic Martial Arts training from tomorrow. Let’s try to see how much your control of the cursed energy has developed.” Nanami-sensei asked as he handed me some exercises to focus on.</p><p><br></p><p>Gojo-san on the other hand started working on Naruto.</p><p><br></p><p>But first we went outside to awaken his cursed energy.</p><p><br></p><p>We used the same method as in my case.</p><p><br></p><p>Naruto looked at the sword in his hand excitedly. “Are we going to fight some bad guys or save some princesses? Ohh are we going to fight some monsters?”</p><p><br></p><p>The kid jumped around.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nope. We first need to learn how to do that. I mean you want to learn cool techniques first, right?” Gojo-san baited.</p><p><br></p><p>Poor Naurto nodded his head in excitement.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. Then first things first. There is a dangerous curse in the sword. First thing we need to do is identify it. Take it in your hand, sit cross legged and concentrate on it.”</p><p><br></p><p>He was instructed to basically follow the same steps as me and what resulted at the end of it was a massive surge of Cursed Energy from his body.</p><p><br></p><p>The energy was so great that I staggered a few steps back while Nanami-sensei was almost blown away till Gojo-san held his shoulder.</p><p><br></p><p>A spectre of an animal appeared around him and slowly took the form of tails as a reddish energy enveloped him. The tails began to rise from one to two and further, the form over a Nine Tailed Fox enveloped the boy.</p><p><br></p><p>The energy was immense and I had to shield my face to keep looking forward.</p><p><br></p><p>“Gojo, this is too much. I don’t think the barrier will be able to hold much longer if this continues.” Nanami-sensei shouted.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hold on. It’s not yet done.” he then looked towards me. “Cover yourself in your Cursed Energy to resist it.”</p><p><br></p><p>I did so and sure enough the whole pressure disappeared.</p><p><br></p><p>By now the area around us was crumbling down.</p><p><br></p><p>The number of tails had reached eight.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, just as the ninth tail was about to emerge, all of a sudden, golden chains burst out of his back and bound the beast suddenly.</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>It’s those damned chains again. Are you going to keep me chained even after your death… Kushina.</em>” A demonic sounding voice sounded but another burst of golden light sparked from the other side, completely suppressing it.</p><p><br></p><p>What was left were two figures, one with red hair and the other a golden blonde.</p><p><br></p><p>“Those are…” I asked, stunned.</p><p><br></p><p>“Vengeful Cursed Spirits.” Gojo-san replied. “They were inside Naruto. Sensing their energies, and their similarities to Naruto, I would say that those were probably his parents. Remember Silas-kun, the most potent of the curses are always born out of love. Without love, there will be no hate. Those two were protecting him even now, even after their deaths.”</p><p><br></p><p> I looked at the two figures. They looked like monsters.</p><p><br></p><p>But even now, they were protecting him.</p><p><br></p><p>The scene made me feel extremely emotional.</p><p><br></p><p>The entire area calmed down in a while and what was left were only rubbles.</p><p><br></p><p>In the middle, Naruto was still sitting down, tears in his eyes but unharmed. The sword in his hand had crumbled.</p><p><br></p><p>The kid looked at us and I felt the urge to protect him suddenly. He looked so vulnerable.</p><p><br></p><p>I was about to walk forward but Gojo-san held my shoulder and stopped me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t be hasty. The two spirits might not like it if you went ahead so quickly.”</p><p><br></p><p>And as if to demonstrate, he walked forward but to our surprise, the blonde spirit disappeared from his place, appearing in front of him, slicing down with its sword-like claw.</p><p><br></p><p>Gojo-san lifted a finger and stopped it but the shockwave sent the debris flying around.</p><p><br></p><p>“Calm down. I don’t mean to harm him.” Gojo-san said as he moved to the side to avoid another attack.</p><p><br></p><p>The place he was in was struck by a golden chain, making a small crater in the place.</p><p><br></p><p>Gojo-san disappeared from his place and appeared in a different place. To everyone’s surprise though, a chain emerged from under the ground, attacking him.</p><p><br></p><p>He dodged to the side but the chain grazed him, creating a scratch on his leg.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s…” Nanami-sensei exclaimed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hoh, now isn’t that interesting? But let’s not fight right now. My student needs me. We can fight each other later on.” Gojo-san disappeared from his place and appeared in front of Naruto.</p><p><br></p><p>The two Spirits attacked him but paused when they saw Naruto in his arms, hugging him.</p><p><br></p><p>“There there, no need to cry. They are just being protective of you.” He ruffled the kid’s hair gently and then looked at the spirits. “I don’t mean him any harm, so you can relax.” He raised his hand as if in surrender. The spirits didn’t disappear however.</p><p><br></p><p>At this time, Naruto chimed in too. “Gojo-sensei is my teacher. He’s not hurting me.”</p><p><br></p><p>This finally caused the spirits to stop and finally disappear and Naruto fainted.</p><p><br></p><p>“Jeez, talk about overprotective parents.” Gojo-san laughed and he walked towards us.</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly opened the door to the Restaurant and led them in.</p><p><br></p><p>We let Naruto rest on one of the couches as Shoko-san was called to look over him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Seriously, what kind of training were you two doing? It hasn’t even been fifteen minutes yet.” She chided.</p><p><br></p><p>“There were… complications.”</p><p><br></p><p>“With an eight year old?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Gojo-sensei just pointed to his already healed leg. There was still a scratch on his clothes.</p><p><br></p><p>Shoko-san paused completely at the sight.</p><p><br></p><p>“What happened?”</p><p><br></p><p>“An extremely strong Cursed Spirit, even making Sukuna look like a kid in terms of his Cursed Energy and…”</p><p><br></p><p>“And?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Two Vengeful Cursed Spirits protecting him.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Two?” She asked, incredulously.</p><p><br></p><p>“Two.” Nanami-sensei nodded. “Seriously, this is way above my pay grade.” he looked at me. “Let’s teach you some theories about Jujutsu.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded. The incidents of today didn’t leave me wanting to practise anymore.</p><p><br></p><p>Miu had come later on with Hayato-sana and took Naruto away. Gojo-san informed him about the case with Naruto.</p><p><br></p><p>I too cleaned up after my lessons and retired for the day.</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I woke up and prepared for the day.</p><p><br></p><p>Around an hour later, Sakura came downstairs with Shoko-san.</p><p><br></p><p>“She is fully healed now. All those worms were removed from her body. But I still suggest not letting her go back to those monsters. I will send Satoru to have a talk with them first. Till then make sure that she doesn’t leave this Restaurant. Just in case, Nanami can stay here till then.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s fine. As long as we are in this place, I can take care of any kind of trouble.”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at me for a moment then nodded. “I hope you understand the meaning of your words because if she falls into the hands of those monsters again, I don’t think she would survive. I will come back later on to check up on her.” She began to leave and that’s when I realised that she hadn’t eaten anything since yesterday.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wait a minute. Let me cook something for you as a token of thanks.”</p><p><br></p><p>She waved her hands. “It’s fine. You are also a student of the Tokyo Jujutsu Academy and someone who helped us a lot. This is nothing compared to that.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Please. It won’t take much time and I won’t brag but I am a pretty decent cook. Let me treat you once.”</p><p><br></p><p>She shrugged her shoulders. “Alright.”</p><p><br></p><p>I got to work quickly and prepared a feast for her.</p><p><br></p><p>While I was doing so, Sakura walked into the kitchen.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at her and she stared back without saying anything. I noticed that her eyes were not as blank as before. She suddenly bowed deeply in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.” She said, her voice choking a bit. She didn’t say anything but didn’t raise her head either.</p><p><br></p><p>Last night, they had told me exactly how much she had suffered and what she could have gone through.</p><p><br></p><p>It explained the look in her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>So I wanted to help her even if it was just a bit.</p><p><br></p><p>“I told you, didn't I, that we’re friends and friends are supposed to help each other. You don’t need to worry. You can stay here as long as you like. If you want, I can talk to Hayato-san and get you admitted to a school in a different world with new identities. You don’t have to go back to that place ever again.” I placed a hand on her head and caressed her.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at me with teary eyes and tried to speak but choked so she just nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled and gave her a half hug and patted her back.</p><p><br></p><p>“You know, as great it is to see you two flirting, can you work on my breakfast faster? I still have to go back to school for work.” Shoko-san’s words brought us out of the moment and I smiled abashed at her.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will get it done in a moment.” I replied before turning to Sakura. “You should wait with her. I will make something for you too.”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded and followed Shoko-san.</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly prepared the meals and served them.</p><p><br></p><p>“I heard that you were going to admit her in a school with the Martial Arts girl?” Shoko-san asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“If she agrees to.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You are an official adult and have taken responsibility for her. That makes you her guardian so I’m asking you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I think it would be a good change of pace for her to experience a normal school life.” I replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then your thinking is naive.” She scoffed lightly.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at her astonished.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t misunderstand me. I never said it was bad, just naive. Someone who has gone through things Sakura has gone through rarely if ever gets to have a normal life. First things first, you should teach her how to protect herself.” Shoko-san said as she took a bite of the food. “Oh, this is good. You weren’t bragging about being a good cook.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I won’t force her with anything.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then decide it between yourself. I would suggest that she learn Jujutsu. With her situation, I doubt she wouldn’t have some manner of affinity for Jujutsu sorcery.”</p><p><br></p><p>I contemplated for a second and looked at Sakura. “What do you want, Sakura?”</p><p><br></p><p>She bowed her head slightly and then looked at me. “I will do whatever you want me to do.” She said, resolve shining in her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is your life Sakura.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And you have saved it and are still helping me. I trust your judgement.”</p><p><br></p><p>I took a deep breath. “Okay then. Let’s learn Jujutsu together. I’ll talk to Principal Masamichi and ask him for a favour.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry. I’ll take care of it.” Shoko-san said between a bite of her food. “She can start her training when she’s fully stabilised from the shock.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay.”</p><p><br></p><p>The rest of the breakfast was mostly uneventful as Shoko-san left soon after eating, leaving the two of us alone in the Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>I had the whole day left so I started preparing for the day and Sakura followed me. She sometimes lent a hand despite me asking for her to rest.</p><p><br></p><p>At least she was more active than before so I didn’t say anything.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>It was evening and time to open the Restaurant again.</p><p><br></p><p>This time Sakura was assisting me in arranging things.</p><p><br></p><p>Tobio was the first one to come.</p><p><br></p><p>He was here to pick up a bento for himself</p><p><br></p><p>“Did they find any news about Sae-chan?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>He shook his head disappointedly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry. You will find her soon.” I reassured him and patted his shoulder. He left for school soon after.</p><p><br></p><p>A few minutes later, the door opened again and the customers from yesterday came in one by one. </p><p><br></p><p>The Ryozanpaku Masters, the Jujutsu Academy teachers as well as Kisuke-san all returned.</p><p><br></p><p>Hayato-san thanked the teachers from the academy for taking care of Naruto and helping him out.</p><p><br></p><p>After serving their orders, we sat together.</p><p><br></p><p>Principal Masamichi questioned Sakura about the place she lived and the one who was behind all this.</p><p><br></p><p>I placed a hand on her and she explained the basics about her world.</p><p><br></p><p>Their world had people called magus who used something called Magecraft.</p><p><br></p><p>She was adopted into the family by the head of the family called Zouken Matou who used some kind of ritual to give her the bloodline of their family. One of the main reasons behind this was the fact that the original heir of the family wasn’t born with Magical Circuits, the nerves through which magic flowed and was necessary for one to use Magecraft in their world.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy I had punched earlier was the original heir of their family and he held a grudge against her for this.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, that Zouken bastard was actually preparing her for some kind of experiment and from what Kisuke-san and the rest had deduced, he was probably planning to make her a vessel to possess her and take over her body.</p><p><br></p><p>The things he had put her through was so that he could absorb magic from her to stay alive.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy was not even human anymore, as most of his soul was inside the worms. From what Sakura said, there was a pit of worms under the Matou residence, which was the place where he lived.</p><p><br></p><p>“This should be enough to qualify him as a curse user, right Sensei?”Gojo-san asked in a very nonchalant voice.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you going to stop if I say no?” Principal sighed.</p><p><br></p><p>Gojo-san didn’t answer and for once even Nanami-sensei didn’t say anything.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are there any organisations who would take action against this Zouken person if they found out about his actions?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t know.” Sakura shook her head.</p><p><br></p><p>“If they could then they would have done so earlier. The fact they didn’t means that they either didn’t know anything or didn’t do anything. Either of which is a failure. If left alone, that monster could target someone else. Why are we even discussing all this?” The doctor asked, irritated.</p><p><br></p><p>“Because that is a different world. It is outside our jurisdiction.” The Principal argued.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, that solves a lot of things doesn’t it? That means whatever I do there is none of your business then.” Gojo-san got up and dusted his clothes. “I have been really itching to go to other worlds and I owe Shoko one for helping out. Sakura-chan, can you tell me where this Matou residence is in your world?”</p><p><br></p><p>He was however not the only one to stand, Kisuke-san stood up too. “I have been quite curious about the magecraft of this world which could manipulate souls too. Can I accompany you? I might be able to help you somewhere.” He asked to which Gojo-san just shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>Sakura however was quiet.</p><p><br></p><p>At this, Shoko-san spoke up again. “Don’t be quiet Sakura. If you keep quiet today, there is a chance that that monster would do the same thing to some other unfortunate person.” She urged and finally Sakura looked up and told the address to them and opened the door.</p><p><br></p><p>As they were leaving, Shoko-san called out from behind. “Satoru?”</p><p><br></p><p>Gojo-san looked back.</p><p><br></p><p>“Make it painful.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure.”</p><p><br></p><p>With that said the two people left the Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>The only reason that the Masters of Ryozanpaku didn’t do so was because they didn’t know anything about magic and could fall into traps.</p><p><br></p><p>They however decided to help her out whenever they could.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Kisuke Urahara -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He looked around the place.</p><p><br></p><p>A different word.</p><p><br></p><p>He tried to sense the surroundings and sensed many things different from his previous world.</p><p><br></p><p>It really was a different world.</p><p><br></p><p>Even now, he was finding it hard to believe that the Restaurant had the power to do such an outrageous thing.</p><p><br></p><p>Yesterday, when he had suddenly found a dark spot during his routine observation of Karakura town and went to see for himself what was going on there only to discover this wonderful place.</p><p><br></p><p>Different worlds.</p><p><br></p><p>Completely different power systems.</p><p><br></p><p>Curses.</p><p><br></p><p>Ninjutsu.</p><p><br></p><p>Martial Arts which can manipulate internal energy.</p><p><br></p><p>At first he had thought that they were joking but his thoughts were completely shattered when he tried to sense the owner and felt enormous power within him.</p><p><br></p><p>The next one to come in his range was that kid, Naruto.</p><p><br></p><p>The power inside him… it was unreal.</p><p><br></p><p>On listening and observing the people, he found out more about the situation of the Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>This was a place which connected many worlds together. Most of these people were from different worlds.</p><p><br></p><p>His talks with the girl, Miu clarified the situation even more.</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s where he heard something interesting in their conversation.</p><p><br></p><p>Someone experimenting with a girl and the tortures she had suffered, but the thing which caught his attention the most was the manipulation of the soul being mentioned.</p><p><br></p><p>This was something he needed to see.</p><p><br></p><p>His senses had already found the traces of some items containing souls of some kind in the bag in the hands of the white haired guy.</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s why he decided to work.</p><p><br></p><p>If they had some method of affecting the soul, then he needed to know it and prepare for it.</p><p><br></p><p>He still didn’t know what kind of place this Restaurant was so it was better to be prepared.</p><p><br></p><p>What he had encountered was a unique but rough craftsmanship of someone dividing someone’s soul and making relics to take over other people’s bodies.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl whom he assisted in treating was a more interesting case though.</p><p><br></p><p>The worms inside her were… revolting.</p><p><br></p><p>He was not a saint by any means but there were things even he disliked. One of the reasons he and Mayuri were so different despite having similar hobbies.</p><p><br></p><p>But revolted he might be, he did find this technique a more advanced version of the last one.</p><p><br></p><p>The worm in the heart contained the soul while the other worms were used to absorb magical energy and feed it back to the user.</p><p><br></p><p>She was both a battery as well as a future vessel for that person.</p><p><br></p><p>The most interesting thing about the girl however were the nerve-like network inside her body. Magic Circuits she had called those.</p><p><br></p><p>How fascinating.</p><p><br></p><p>They had some kind of energy flow through them different from Spiritual energy and yet these nerves were intertwined and connected to her soul.</p><p><br></p><p>He made sure that he separated the worms without harming them in any way and for that, he used his Bankai.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the technique used by the doctor was quite amazing. She might not have noticed it but that thing was also healing her soul to some extent. A very tiny extent but it was there. Which meant it could be improved. So fascinating.</p><p><br></p><p>But what was the most stunning thing he saw was probably that boy Touma.</p><p><br></p><p>That boy’s power both stunned him as well as sent shivers down his spine.</p><p><br></p><p>The only thing even remotely comparable to it was perhaps the Hogyoku.</p><p><br></p><p>The entire night of research had given him many insights into the workings of Magic Circuits. He still had to work on the information he had received about curses but they seemed a bit like hollows to him so they might share some common features. He will have to find one for himself to experiment on later.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why when he saw a chance to go to another world, he jumped at the opportunity.</p><p><br></p><p>The soul in the worms had been degraded and he wanted to know why such a thing happened. Just what kind of magic could degrade the soul. Also, how was he transferring magic from the worms back to his main body?</p><p><br></p><p>Sakura didn’t know much about Magecraft so he wondered if he could get some books for himself while he was there as well.</p><p><br></p><p>While he was thinking of these, he detected the same soul signature as the one from the worm and pointed towards the direction. “There. Three kilometres away in that direction.”</p><p><br></p><p>Gojo looked at him and then towards the direction and placed a hand on his shoulder.</p><p><br></p><p>The next moment, they were facing the gates of an old Japanese style mansion.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Movement technique?</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>It was too fast to be so, not to mention that he would have sensed it.</p><p><br></p><p>Spatial Technique.</p><p><br></p><p>Spatial Kido and techniques were banned in the Soul Society and were something he hadn’t really delved much into except for opening senkaimon between Soul Society, Hueco Mundo and the Human World.</p><p><br></p><p>But it was not this fast.</p><p><br></p><p>While he was thinking of this, Gojo made some handsigns and a thin barrier spread over the place.</p><p><br></p><p>“Kisuke-san, can I leave it to you to see that no one escapes?” Gojo said while pulling down his glasses and revealing a very unique pair of eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Those eyes had to have some kind of power. Kisuke just knew it as he watched the man look directly towards the ground below the mansion as if seeing through all the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, sure. They are thirty five metres from our current position, ten metres below the ground.” He offered while making some barriers of his own. His Spiritual senses had already locked on to the signature of the rest of Zouken’s soul. “Just make sure you don’t destroy the books and information too much. Such good research data would be hard to come by.” He said as he made a barrier of his own. “There, now the souls won’t be escaping. By the way, we should make it quick. There was an unusually large signal in this town. We might not want to attract too much attention.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright then. Get back a little.” He pointed a finger towards the place where Kisuke sensed the soul from and a red orb, similar to Hado Number 31: Shakkahō and it blasted through the ground, creating a hole for them to walk.</p><p><br></p><p>“You could have just teleported us, you know?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Now now, where’s the fun in that? Moreover, isn’t it a common courtesy to knock the door down when coming in?”</p><p><br></p><p>It’s knocking <em>on</em> the door, not knocking <em>down</em> the door.</p><p><br></p><p>“You can go and collect whatever you want first. Just don’t get too close to the fight. I will go and do some pest control first.” Gojo said. Kisuke didn’t need another word as he disappeared from his place with a Shunpo.</p><p><br></p><p>It was important to save as many books and research papers as he could as fast as he could because Gojo didn’t look like the person to cleanly take care of things.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Shinji Matou -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Shit!</p><p><br></p><p>What the fuck was going on?</p><p><br></p><p>He had been thinking that he had hit his head too hard yesterday when he started hearing voices in his head until he was dragged into the presence of one of the ugliest looking guys.</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s where he found out what exactly he had eaten.</p><p><br></p><p>A finger.</p><p><br></p><p>He had eaten a finger of a dead body.</p><p><br></p><p>That bastard!</p><p><br></p><p>He would make sure that he kicks that bastard in the face when he is brought down and enjoy himself when torturing him.</p><p><br></p><p>He would show that bitch that she belonged only to him and no one else and that she couldn’t ever escape from his grasp. He will make her submit to him.</p><p><br></p><p>But eating a finger wasn’t even the worst part. The worst part was that it was cursed.</p><p><br></p><p>They had cursed him and now he was stuck with a ghost who was always trying and taking over his body the moment he lost any concentration.</p><p><br></p><p>Yesterday, it had tried going back to the Restaurant only to come across a scene where a man in a funny green and white striped hat was destroying his finger.</p><p><br></p><p>The spirit had left the control of his body to him the moment he saw the people inside the room and he didn’t dare enter the Restaurant, just watching from outside.</p><p><br></p><p>That still didn’t stop the ghost from raging inside his head when he saw his finger being destroyed, swearing to kill each and everyone of them present there.</p><p><br></p><p>Shinji had quickly escaped from the area but before he could reach back home and ask his grandfather for help, the ghost had taken over his body and began interrogating him.</p><p><br></p><p>He hadn’t been able to leave till the morning when the ghost suddenly left the control of his body back to him.</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t know why but honestly, he didn’t even want to know. All he knew was that he had to reach home first so he quickly ran back towards his home, only to encounter a barrier outside.</p><p><br></p><p>What followed was a loud sound of explosion and smoke rising from his house.</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t know what was happening but Shinji had a feeling that he wouldn’t be having good days ahead.</p><p><br></p><p>____________________________x_________________________________________________________x_____________________________</p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Alright, this chapter took a day or so more than I expected.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I didn’t want to skip on the scenes by just hand waving them and had to plan them in detail.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>All of this happened in one evening mostly so not much happened in the chapter in the background.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I thought about Naruto’s birth conditions, the amounts of deaths and negative feelings directed towards him, not to mention Kurama, the self proclaimed living embodiment of hatred sealed inside him as well as his own depressing childhood experiences.

Some of them were oddballs while some had become good friends with me. </p><p>For example, right now, when the rush hour had ended and I was sitting with some of my regulars, playing games.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Heal me, heal me.\" Suzuki shouted while Saitama rushed in to attack the other team.</p><p><br></p><p>I cast a low heal on Suzuki's character, Momonga and threw in two buffs to reduce physical and magical damage later.</p><p><br></p><p>Our last team member, Mikami, tanked attacks meant for me.</p><p><br></p><p>Suzuki finished conjuring his spell and landed a massive AoE on the opponent team, clearing them all.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yeahhh!”</p><p><br></p><p>We cheered at our victory.</p><p><br></p><p>The crowd gathered behind us did the same.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole place had become almost like a close-knit family.</p><p><br></p><p>At one corner, Touma, Miu and Naruto were training under the guidance of Hayato who was drinking tea with the rest of the old men.</p><p><br></p><p>The three cheered at our victory and were quickly rewarded with a bash on their heads by the old man, making all of them return back to their forms with a  bump on each of their heads.</p><p><br></p><p>I got up and let the three play the rest, passing by Naruto and brushing his hair lightly, earning a smile from the boy.</p><p><br></p><p>“How are you liking your new home, Naruto?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s awesome. Everyone is very good to me. Apachai is fun to play around with. Pervy-sensei is funny. Shigure Nee-san teaches me how to throw Kunai and said she will even teach me how to use a sword and Miu Nee-san makes really good food. Although Akisame-sensei’s lessons are hard, he is really good.” He shouted excitedly, telling me about everyone in the Dojo.</p><p><br></p><p>It has been two weeks since he was adopted by Hayato-san and the guy has been nothing but happy. It was a drastic change from the kid who couldn’t even believe that I would feed him in my Restaurant. The kid got a proper haircut and a change of clothes and looked like a completely different person with the confidence he had now.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. All the Masters at the Dojo like Naruto-kun a lot. He has even been able to keep up with training many adults cannot. In fact, Grandpa found that he has an insane amount of Ki and can become a very great Martial Artist, even a Legendary Master like Grandpa.” Miu said.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will totally become a legendary Master. dattebayo!” The boy in question shouted with excitement, making me smile.</p><p><br></p><p>“You sure will. But you need to study and train properly for that.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm.”</p><p><br></p><p>As we were talking, the door to the Restaurant opened once again and another familiar face came in.</p><p><br></p><p>“Welcome Sakura-san.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hello, Silas-san.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sakura Matou, another one of our regular customers, always came to the Restaurant. She liked to watch the new people come to the Restaurant and listen about their worlds.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl was very polite and liked by everyone in the Restaurant because of her attitude.</p><p><br></p><p>Being of similar age to Miu, they sometimes talked with each other.</p><p><br></p><p>Still… I don’t know why, but there was something odd about the girl. It was just a feeling but it always looked like she was sad when she was alone.</p><p><br></p><p>Although when talking with everyone here, she smiled and looked quite happy. So, I didn’t mind when she came here and spent time with everyone.</p><p><br></p><p>Today however something strange happened.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a knock on the door.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked out but couldn’t see anyone so I went ahead and opened the door… and froze at the sight in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>\"What happened, Silas?\"</p><p><br></p><p>I heard a voice behind me.</p><p><br></p><p>Mikami, the owner of the voice came beside me and froze similarly at the sight in front of us.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Eh, what's going on?\" Naruto came from the back.</p><p><br></p><p>I shook awake from my shock and tried to stop him but he had already stepped out. </p><p><br></p><p>\"Woah. So cool!\"</p><p><br></p><p>“Look out!” I said but Naruto was already jumping around and looking at the being in front of us.</p><p><br></p><p>A Dragon.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a fucking dragon.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nii-san. There is a sword on its back. It’s hurt.”</p><p><br></p><p>The little guy was much faster than me and was already on top of the dragon and pulled out the sword before I could say anything.</p><p><br></p><p>By now the other patrons of the Restaurant had arrived as well.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my.”</p><p><br></p><p>The Dragon looked in pain and somehow, I could see a ton of emotions in its eyes. It was as if it understood everything.</p><p><br></p><p>I decided to try my luck. “Do you understand us?”</p><p><br></p><p>It didn’t answer but just looked at us.</p><p><br></p><p>“We don’t wish to hurt you.”</p><p><br></p><p>And yet there was no answer.</p><p><br></p><p>So I decided to take a different approach.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t hurt it.” I ordered.</p><p><br></p><p>Saitama and the rest were waiting in alert to respond to any action from the said dragon.</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly went inside the Restaurant and bought a Cheese Rabbit, a hundred and eighty kilogram monstrosity. I couldn’t buy the entire thing but still got a sizable chunk of it.</p><p><br></p><p>Outside, the whole Restaurant had gathered around the Dragon by now.</p><p>It didn’t hurt anyone, thankfully.</p><p><br></p><p>The old guys as well as the Masters of Ryozanpaku were surrounding it. Hayato and Issac were checking its injury.</p><p><br></p><p>Naruto was playing around it.</p><p><br></p><p>The Dragon seemed to be in pain but didn’t make any kind of moves.</p><p><br></p><p>I carried the meat to it and kept it in front of it. “Here. Have something to eat. You must be exhausted with such an injury on your back.” I said and it looked at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm Nii-san makes the best food I have ever eaten. Go on. Eat it.”</p><p><br></p><p>It smelled the food once and then gave it a light lick before taking a bite and just like that, in a matter of moments, the entire thing disappeared.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next few hours, everyone stayed there, around the dragon, till it was time for me to close the Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>I bought another slab of meat for it. “You can eat this if you feel hungry.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Bye Dragon-san. Get healed up soon and play again tomorrow. By the way, my name is Naruto Uzumaki and I am going to be a Legendary Master dattebayo.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t think it understood what a Legendary Master means, Naruto.</p><p><br></p><p>We left the Dragon resting there in peace and closed the door to the Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure you will be alright, Silas?” Mikami asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Saitama waited too.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy had been losing his hair due to training and seemed more… muted nowadays. We have been trying to cheer him up with different things.</p><p><br></p><p>Today’s gaming session was the same.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. I will be alright. I can manage as long as anything is in the Restaurant.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Take care of yourself. If you need any help, feel free to call any of us.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure.” I replied feeling warm at their words.</p><p><br></p><p>Really. Life has never been the same since I got this Restaurant. </p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>It was the next morning and I decided to get to my morning routine.</p><p><br></p><p>Generally, I made snacks and put up a small stall in front of my Restaurant to sell them since none of the people in the neighbourhood could find my Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>Many of them had asked me and I chose this method.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the cheapest of stuff from my System was a delicacy for the people of the world and my cooking was nothing to scoff at either.</p><p><br></p><p>I opened my stall and sure enough one after another, customers started coming one by one.</p><p><br></p><p>Some of the customers were regular faces and some were new.</p><p><br></p><p>It was the early hours and people generally came to get something for their bentos.</p><p><br></p><p>And today too, two such students were running in a hurry.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tobi-kun, wait a minute. Let’s get something to eat from here. Okaa-sama was sick this morning so I couldn’t make bento.” A girl said to the boy beside her as she stopped in front of my store.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl had brown hair and green eyes while the boy had black hair and black eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“I didn’t know there was a store here. Did you open this recently? I don’t think I have seen you here before.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. It’s been two weeks. I just moved in recently. My name is Silas by the way.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Tobio Ikuse. Nice to meet you.” The boy greeted.</p><p><br></p><p>“My name is Sae Toujou. Nice to meet you too Silas-san.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Would you like to try something? There are some pieces for the free trial.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh… thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>They took a bit of the karaage I had made with a little hesitation and their faces lit up.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is amazing, Silas-san.” the girl, Sae exclaimed. The boy didn't say anything but his reaction said it all.</p><p><br></p><p>The two ordered two bentos and left in a hurry for school. </p><p><br></p><p>_____________________________________x__________________________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>\"And you know what, she totally meant that I wouldn't get married. That bitch! *<em>Hick</em>* Did she mean I am old?\"</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled awkwardly as I placed a plate of tempura in front of her.</p><p><br></p><p>The lady in front of me was a new customer.</p><p><br></p><p>Shizuka Hiratsuka is a teacher at a nearby school. She had come in an hour ago and ordered some alcohol for herself.</p><p><br></p><p>Today was Saturday and tomorrow was her day off so she was here to drink today.</p><p><br></p><p>It’s just that… she was a bad drunk.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are still young, right Mikami?” I called for help from Mikami who looked like a deer caught in the headlights.</p><p><br></p><p>Mikami had brought along his junior who was here to… well show off his girlfriend. Mikami had ordered sake to drown his sorrows of being single, and I, being his friend, helped him out by bringing out an expensive bottle of wine since it was his junior who was paying.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thirty year aged Wine bottle. 150,000 yen only. Your junior wouldn’t want his girlfriend to have anything less, right?” I gave him a smile. It took him a moment to understand and when he did, an evil smile came over the normally gentle guy’s face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes yes. They are a couple in love. People like those should…”</p><p><br></p><p>“DIE. The fools like those who show off their love in front of others, loving the fact that others have been busy with their lives and haven’t had the chance to find someone good yet and that they are growing old with each passing day. People like those… they should all die.” Shizuka muttered.</p><p><br></p><p>… I don’t think that should happen.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well not die exactly but going into debt and crying as their girlfriend leaves them is also good.” She continued.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>This woman was quite vindictive.</p><p><br></p><p>“I like the second option more. I can then bring him here again and have him pay for the sake while I listen to his sob story with some tempura and wine which he pays for.” Mikami continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hehehehe.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hehehehe.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>These two… they were getting along quite well.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Would you like to come along for a drink? My junior has come here to brag about his girlfriend and is paying the bills.\" He showed her the bottle and gave her the same grin I gave him.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Oh… is that so? Then let's rui… I mean congratulate him for this.\" She got up from her seat with a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>As I saw them walk to the seat where his junior was waiting, only one thought went through my head.</p><p><br></p><p>Did Mikami just pick up a girl?</p><p><br></p><p>At this time, the door to the Restaurant was opened and in came a face I hadn’t seen in a long time.</p><p><br></p><p>It was the cocky white haired guy. This time he had even come with friends.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a young girl, a bit younger than my own age and another guy who looked like a salaryman. There was also a guy who looked like a suspicious government agent with them.</p><p><br></p><p>“A Restaurant? Why did you bring us to a Restaurant?” The salaryman asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Because this is the best Restaurant there is in the world and probably many other worlds. You should try the sweets here. They are to die for.”</p><p><br></p><p>The white haired guy praised my food and I would say that I was flattered a bit.</p><p><br></p><p>He came up to me directly. “Owner-san, long time no see. How have you been?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Welcome to the Crossroads Restaurant. Yes, almost three weeks. Were you out of the city?”</p><p><br></p><p>“A bit, yes. By the way, I realise I haven’t introduced myself. My name is Satoru Gojo. These are my friends and she is my student.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hello everyone, my name is Silas Evans.” I looked at them before looking at the newly introduced Gojo-san, “Are they also?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, yes. They are also sorcerers like me. In fact, this is the former Principal of my school.”</p><p><br></p><p>This attracted my attention and I couldn’t help but ask. “Is there a school where magic is taught?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Jujutsu. Who is this pretty boy, Sensei?” The girl asked as I handed them the menu.</p><p><br></p><p>“Silas-kun is the owner of this amazing Restaurant. Now go on and choose what you want to eat. Don’t hold back. I will be paying for this.” he waved her off before looking at me. “Jujutsu is different from normal magic so I don’t know if you will like it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What other kind of magic is there?” The Salaryman asked. “I am Nanami Kento and I am just his acquaintance.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah you wound my heart, Nanami-kun.” Gojo joked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hello.” I looked at Gojo-san. “You haven’t told them about it yet?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Nah, I wanted to surprise them.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What are you talking about Satoru? Is this another one of your pranks?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Nope. You can ask Silas-kun about it.”</p><p><br></p><p>They looked to me for an explanation and I explained the basics of my Restaurant to them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you serious?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Bullshit.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You could always see for yourself.” I shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>It took me two minutes to show them a scene from Suzuki’s world and then back to their own and then I left the stunned group aside to bring their orders.</p><p><br></p><p>When I served them, Gojo-san questioned me again. “On a side note, is Touma-kun visiting? I have a new job for him. The same kind as last time.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Touma-kun has gone for his daily training. You will probably find him back in a few hours.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s fine. We have free time today.” He said. </p><p><br></p><p>“If you don’t mind me asking, what other kind of magic have you seen?” The principal asked me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Other kinds of magic? Well, I haven’t exactly seen any in use but there are Espers in Touma-kun’s and Saitama’s world. Recently we had a Ninja come from a mediaeval world’s Ninja village. The kid was adopted by one of the patrons and from what we found out, they use Ninjutsu to do different kinds of things. Apparently, his village was saved from the attack of a giant Nine Tailed Fox by the previous leader of their village. There were also some kind of supernatural powers called Nen in Issac-san’s world too.” I answered as I recalled the things I had seen in the past few days. “Oh and we saw a dragon yesterday.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A Dragon?” The girl asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yup. A real Dragon.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Seriously. A lot of things happened while I was away. A Dragon of all things. By the way, you wanted to know about Jujutsu so let me explain about it in brief.”</p><p><br></p><p>They gave me a brief summary of the thing and seriously, their world was fucking dangerous.</p><p><br></p><p>But damn if I wasn’t interested.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean it was Magic.</p><p><br></p><p>Which kid hasn’t imagined making fireballs or water blades when they were kids?</p><p><br></p><p>Now that there was a chance for me to see and maybe even learn it for myself, why wouldn’t I?</p><p><br></p><p>“So, anyone can learn this kind of magic?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, not anyone per say. They need to have some talent for it. They will need to have a certain amount of Cursed Energy to see spirits and if possible some kind of innate tenchiques in them.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see.”</p><p><br></p><p>“If you are interested then I can test and see if you have the talent for it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Really?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yup.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then I would like to see too. We can check it when your work with Touma is completed.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure. Why not? It’s always nice to see new Jujutsu Sorcerers.” The principal guy said.</p><p><br></p><p>I served them their order and went around to take orders from the rest.</p><p><br></p><p>An hour or so later, the door of the Restaurant opened again and the Ryozanpaku group arrived. Miu and Naruto were missing as they went to school.</p><p><br></p><p>“Welcome. Touma-kun, there are people waiting for you.” I pointed towards Gojo-san who was already waving at him and his group.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy went to the group of Magicians or rather Sorcerers.</p><p><br></p><p>I gave them a private space in one of the rooms of the Restaurant to discuss and went to serve the other guests.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Satoru Gojo -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Is he the one, Gojo?” The Principal, Yaga asked him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. Hello, Touma-kun. It’s been a long time. How have you been? Did you get your payment for the last job?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh yes! It was too much. I didn’t do anything.” Touma tried explaining but he just waved it off.</p><p><br></p><p>“Trust me when I say that you did more than I could ever hope for. If anything, the payment I gave was far less than what you deserved.” He truly did. Considering the fact that Nanami and Kugisaki as well as Yaga might have just died along with several others, a few millions were comparatively nothing.</p><p><br>Still, Touma was quite a good kid. He reminded him of Yuji in a way, always ready to help others.</p><p><br></p><p>“No no. It was already too much. I don’t want more.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Gojo is right. You have done us a great favour. Don’t deny it.” Yaga-san said, making Touma quiet.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have another favour to ask of you Touma-kun.” He asked, bringing out a box with several talismans covering it and then went on to explain about several things.</p><p><br></p><p>Cursed Objects and Cursed Tools.</p><p><br></p><p>Cursed Spirits.</p><p><br></p><p>Jujutsu Sorcerers.</p><p><br>Cursed Humans.</p><p><br></p><p>“What we want to do is see if you can exorcise any cursed objects and cursed tools with your power. We will try with the low powered tools and go higher.” Principal Yaga explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“I can try.”</p><p><br></p><p>“In that case, let’s start with this one.”</p><p><br></p><p>They started with Grade 3 Cursed Objects and under the awed gazes of everyone, the object simply crumbled with a single touch from Touma.</p><p><br></p><p>“Amazing!” Nanami whispered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Right right! I told you it was amazing.” He poked, causing the man to ignore him completely.</p><p><br></p><p>Next up came a Grade 2 Cursed Object and then a Grade One and every one of them met the same end.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you need any rest, Touma-kun? We are going to start with the important ones now.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, I don’t feel anything wrong. We can start anytime you want.”</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, Touma’s power was insane.</p><p><br></p><p>And this was coming from someone like him.</p><p><br></p><p>Next up, Yaga-sensei unsealed a Special Grade Cursed object for the test.</p><p><br></p><p>“Be careful when…” Before Nanami could finish it, Touma had already touched the object and it crumbled into a pile of dust, making the man shut his mouth.</p><p><br></p><p>Satoru just gave the man his best smile.</p><p><br></p><p>“Screw this. We have to work so hard to exorcise even one of these curses and this guy just erases them with a touch. That’s cheating sensei. Totally cheating.” Kugisaki complained.</p><p><br></p><p>“Now now, don’t be jealous. Everyone has their own specialities. Touma-kun’s gift is made specifically for these cases.”</p><p><br></p><p>“This changes a lot of things, Gojo. With this we can erase Sukuna’s fingers, maybe even the curse from someone’s body. We need to bring Yuji here to test it out.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. Tomorrow, I will bring him here. You two should get the other Special Grade Cursed Objects for exorcism. Keeping them sealed is just ignoring the problem.” He said and turned towards Touma. “You know what Touma-kun, if you ever want to become a full time exorcist, do tell me. We would love to have you among us.”</p><p><br></p><p>The guy denied it but he didn’t mind. Kamijou Touma was a living treasure by himself.</p><p><br></p><p>“Will you be free tomorrow for the same job? Today, we just bought some basic ones with us for testing. Safe to say, your power is far greater than what any of us could have imagined. We can begin our work in earnest tomorrow.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, sure. You can find me here at the same time. I go to the Ryozanpaku Dojo for training. You can ask Silas-san for me.” He replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then I thank you in advance. You will receive your payment like the last time… and don’t deny it. This is the least we can do for your help.”</p><p><br></p><p>With everything done, Touma-kun left the room and he was left with the other three.</p><p><br></p><p>“Seriously, what kind of place is this? Other worlds? At first I thought that the owner was crazy… or using some kind of Illusion based Curse technique on us but this… just what kind of place did you wander into this time, Satoru?”</p><p><br></p><p>“This could be an even greater danger than anything we have in our world.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Or it could be a solution, if we don’t even explore our options, how would we ever know?”</p><p><br></p><p>“You are taking a very big risk, Satoru.” Yaga-sensei said before sighing. “But right now, we don’t have many options. What happens tomorrow, happens tomorrow. First we need to save today… and this, despite all the risks involved, is a great opportunity.”</p><p><br></p><p>“If those higher ups ever found out about this place, they would stop at nothing to try and take control of this Restaurant.” Nanami said.</p><p><br></p><p>“If that happens, then I won’t stop to give them a warning. I am a wanted criminal either way. I might as well earn it this time.” He warned.</p><p><br></p><p>Those bastards had done exactly as he had expected.</p><p><br></p><p>The only reason he was not making any moves was because Yuta, Megumi and Yuji were growing at a great pace due to the pressure on them. He didn’t want to interrupt their growth for now. Thus those old coots were living on borrowed time.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Silas -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I served everyone from Ryozanpaku and at the same time Mikami and his group finished.</p><p><br></p><p>Mikami and Shizuka-san left one after another. They had a good chemistry going on.</p><p><br></p><p>If things went on well, then maybe… I smiled at the thought.</p><p><br></p><p>His junior on the other hand, was barely holding back tears at the sight of his wallet but his girlfriend had a huge smile on her face.</p><p><br></p><p>Well, not everything was bad for the poor junior.</p><p><br></p><p>The guys from Ryozanpaku left next.</p><p><br></p><p>Suzuki was going to spend the rest of his day playing his favourite VRMMORPG since it was shutting down today and Saitama was taking a rest.</p><p>And just like that, the Restaurant was almost empty again.</p><p><br></p><p>Half an hour later, Touma came out of the room and a few minutes later, the rest of the group came out.</p><p><br></p><p>This time, it was Yaga-san who transferred the money and I was a bit taken aback once more at the amount.</p><p><br></p><p>Thirty Million yen.</p><p><br></p><p>And I get twenty percent of that.</p><p><br></p><p>It’s a good day.</p><p><br></p><p>With this, I can purchase the house beside mine and expand my Restaurant a bit.</p><p><br></p><p>Things were getting congested with the arrival of the new groups.</p><p><br></p><p>But for now, I had something else I was excited about.</p><p><br></p><p>Magic.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ready for the test, Silas?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then let’s try this. I cannot see any Cursed Energy within you.” My heart sank at his first few words. I was so close to learning magic and now I find that I didn’t even have the energy for it. Gojo however continued. “But then again, I can’t see the Cursed Energy inside anything in this Restaurant. We would need to test it out some other way.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. Gimme a minute, I will close the Restaurant for the day.”</p><p><br></p><p>I did just that and followed them outside.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked around the area and it seemed quite similar.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is this Tokyo?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Shinjuku, yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No wonder it felt familiar.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Is there a Tokyo in your world?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I used to live there when my parents were alive. I moved to a town near Kyoto… due to some reasons and opened a Restaurant there.”</p><p><br></p><p>“How old are you by the way?” Nanami asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am eighteen years old. I just got out of High School.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s quite young.”</p><p><br></p><p>I shrugged. “I had to support myself. I might try to complete college later if I get some time. For now, I have my hands more than full with my Restaurant.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s see. Since you are not from our world, I don’t know how Cursed Energy would work for you but we can check using a Cursed Tool.” He brought out a sword and handed it to me. “Try to concentrate on the blade and feel anything inside.”</p><p><br></p><p>I took a hold of the sword and closed my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Take deep breaths.” Yaga instructed.</p><p><br></p><p>I did and… the blade somehow felt different, as if there was something inside it. A stream of something. It connected to my body and I could feel the entire blade, even with both my eyes closed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good. What do you feel?”</p><p><br></p><p>“There is something, I don’t know how to describe it, inside the sword. It is flowing into my body and I can feel the whole sword now.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Good. The flowing thing is Cursed Energy. Try to feel the energy inside you and push it into the sword.”</p><p><br></p><p>I took a deep breath and willed the now identified Cursed Energy into the blade.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Satoru Gojo -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Amazing. The blade. It’s a Grade 2 Cursed tool. But the power it’s giving out is comparable to Grade 1, maybe even a bit stronger. What do you see, Satoru?”</p><p><br></p><p>He pulled up his blindfold and looked at the guy in front of him, who looked like a tsunami of Cursed Energy.</p><p><br></p><p>It was far above his own and at a level comparable to Yuta when he was using Rika’s power, and it kept on increasing.</p><p><br></p><p>The only reason why Cursed Spirits were not flooding this area was because of the barrier they had put around the area.</p><p><br></p><p>The energy stabilised when he was almost three times more than Yuta and Rika combined, which would make him have almost one and a half times more Cursed Energy than even Ryomen Sukuna…</p><p><br></p><p>And this was just his start.</p><p><br></p><p>Moreover, his Cursed Energy was Cold, almost as if ice and yet it flowed around like a stream full of clear water.</p><p><br></p><p>Was he even a human?</p><p><br></p><p>Ah, yes… he highly doubted that.</p><p><br></p><p>As if a Human could possess a power like the Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Crack</em></p><p><br></p><p>The tsunami stopped with a cracking sound.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked down. The blade had cracked.</p><p><br></p><p>It couldn’t handle the Cursed Energy output anymore.</p><p><br></p><p>“Holy shit!” Kugisaki exclaimed. Normally such words would have earned her a bashing on her head by Yaga-sensei but right now, even the old man was stunned beyond words at the sight in front of him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, I broke the sword. I’m sorry, Nanami-san. How much does this cost? I still have the sword which was struck on the Dragon’s back if you want a replacement.” Silas quickly apologised, looking quite flustered.</p><p><br></p><p>“I-it’s fine. It was just a spare piece. You can keep the sword from the... Dragon’s back for yourself. It would be a great tool for you.” Nanami denied.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, thank you. And again, I am sorry for breaking your sword.” He bowed before looking up. “By the way… did I pass?”</p><p><br></p><p>The innocent and expectant look on his face and the question, combined with the current situation, made Satoru crack and burst out in laughter.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahahahahahaha.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Did something happen?” Silas tilted his head.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nothing. I am just very excited at the prospect of teaching someone like you.” he smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“You will not be teaching him Satoru. Let Nanami do it for now. You are needed outside.” Yaga-sensei interrupted.</p><p><br></p><p>“But…”</p><p><br></p><p>“You can offer him some advice later, but for now, Nanami is more than enough. The first thing he needs to learn is how to control his Cursed Energy and Nanami is a good fit for that.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Tch. Alright. Then from now on, you are officially a member of Tokyo Jujutsu High. We are currently on a vacation and will be operational in a month or two at best. Have fun.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Nanami will come in and instruct you on how to control your Cursed Energy reserves as well as bring some books for you. As Satoru said, your enrollment can be taken care of when the school reopens.”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy bowed lightly. “Thank you for your help.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry. Your Restaurant helped us too.”</p><p><br></p><p>With a few more instructions, both sides parted ways.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well… talk about a surprising day.” He smiled, earning a deadpan from the rest.</p><p><br></p><p>Yup.</p><p><br></p><p>It was fun.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Silas -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>It had been a week since the day I awakened my Cursed Energy and just as promised, Kento Nanami or as I call him now, Nanami-Sensei came regularly to tutor me about Cursed Energy and the basics of being a Jujutsu Sorcerer.</p><p><br></p><p>My lessons basically consisted of learning to control my emotions as Cursed Energy is heavily affected by the emotions of the user and any kind of disturbance can affect the control. It consisted of meditating and other exercises.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, there was another person who gave me very good advice on this topic.</p><p><br></p><p>Issac.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy shared some of his experiences with me and showed me a way to relax my mind very easily.</p><p><br></p><p>And it did help.</p><p><br></p><p>I was asked to continuously channel my Cursed Energy into any object to strengthen it.</p><p><br></p><p>I chose a knife.</p><p><br></p><p>A kitchen knife to be precise.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, I gave them the sword which was pierced in the back of the Dragon and asked to make a few knives out of it.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean, it was something strong enough to pierce a Dragon’s defences, so it’s bound to be strong.</p><p><br></p><p>And so I now have a new pair of knives, enchanted to channel cursed energy.</p><p><br></p><p>These things are stupidly sharp.</p><p><br></p><p>I am pretty sure if my Restaurant wasn’t protected by the System, I would have sliced through the counter several times already.</p><p><br></p><p>I picked up the bowl of Soba Noodles and carried it out to the one who ordered it.</p><p><br></p><p>“Here’s your meal, Saitama.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thanks Silas.”</p><p><br></p><p>Saitama was down for the last few days since both Mikami and Suzuki hadn’t come back in a while. The guy was already a bit depressed with his hairfall and now even his new friends had been missing…</p><p><br></p><p>Even Shizuka-san had returned and asked for Mikami once.</p><p><br></p><p>I was missing them too but I didn’t have a way to contact them in their world.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, even Sakura hadn’t come for a few days.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t know what happened to them but then again, Sakura was a student. Maybe she was busy with her studies while both Mikami and Suzuki were busy with their work.</p><p><br></p><p>I had been busy with the training. It was Saitama who was left alone. Combined with his hair fall, it was a pretty depressing time for the man so I treated him sometimes.</p><p><br></p><p>Money wasn’t an issue for now as Nanami was bringing some Cursed Objects everyday, which Touma exorcised and I got some fees for converting it into Touma’s world’s currency.</p><p><br></p><p>I was currently in the process of buying the building next door. It was old and rundown. I, however, was planning to reconstruct and renovate it soon enough.</p><p><br></p><p>Today was however a special day.</p><p><br></p><p>Today Gojo-san was going to bring a special Cursed Object to be purified.</p><p><br></p><p>As I was talking to Saitama, the door to the Restaurant opened and a familiar face came in.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is this your Restaurant, Silas-san?” Tobio Ikuse asked me.</p><p><br></p><p>He and his friend, Sae, have been buying bentos from me regularly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tobio-kun. Please have a seat. How are you? Alone today? Sae-chan didn’t come with you?”</p><p><br></p><p>A sad look came on his face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did something happen?”</p><p><br></p><p>His fist clenched as he looked up at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sae has gone missing.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What?!”</p><p><br></p><p>He explained the situation then.</p><p><br></p><p>Sae, along with the rest of his class had gone on a school trip but two days ago, the luxury liner they were on… disappeared at sea.</p><p><br></p><p>There still hasn’t been any news of them.</p><p><br></p><p>The reason Tobio was here was because he had fallen sick during the incident and missed the trip.</p><p><br></p><p>I had been so busy the past week that I didn’t even know about such a thing.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy was having difficulty talking about it so I didn’t force him either.</p><p><br></p><p>Tobio had lost his parents at an early age and was taken care of by his grandmother. Even his grandmother passed away later on and he was looked after by Sae’s family the Toujo. </p><p><br></p><p>In fact, the rundown house next door actually belonged to him. He was currently living with Sae’s family.</p><p><br></p><p>They are childhood friends and I could see that the girl had an obvious crush on him. She used to bring him all three meals of the day and now, with her gone….</p><p><br></p><p>I made a bowl of Ramen for him and we talked about a few things.</p><p><br></p><p>I had noticed that Tobio and Sae were the only ones who could find my Restaurant in my neighbourhood. It was one of the reasons I had taken an interest in them.</p><p><br></p><p>It would help me gain some knowledge about how my Restaurant functioned.</p><p><br></p><p>We talked about a few things before he left. The school was closed due to the incident and he needed some time to cope up with it too.</p><p><br></p><p>As Tobio left, the door to the Restaurant opened and in came another person.</p><p><br></p><p>I was a bit taken aback at his getup.</p><p><br></p><p>Green skin tight suit with a bowl cut black hair and… those eyebrows.</p><p><br></p><p>What in the nine hells, was that?</p><p><br></p><p>“A new Restaurant in the area? How youthful!” The guy shouted, doing a fist pump in the air, making me sweatdrop.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is this a weirdo?” Saitama whispered in my ear.</p><p><br></p><p>I… couldn’t answer.</p><p><br></p><p>“Welcome to the Crossroads Restaurant. What would you like to eat?” I greeted.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, my youthful friend. Are you the owner of the Restaurant? Very well, show me the menu!” he shouted.</p><p><br></p><p>Why was he shouting?</p><p><br></p><p>I showed him to a table and gave him the menu.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have never seen such dishes. What are these?”</p><p><br></p><p>“They are the special dishes of the Restaurant.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh. In that case, I will order a stir fry and this Billion Bird egg.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Very well, I will be done in a minute.”<br><br></p><p>“Hahahaha take your time, my youthful friend. Good work can never be rushed!”</p><p><br></p><p>“My name is Silas.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Silas, what an odd name. My name is Might Gai, the Beautiful Blue Beast of Konoha.”</p><p><br></p><p>… Silas, name is odd?</p><p><br></p><p>Dude look in the mirror… and you are named Might Gai….</p><p><br></p><p>“Nice to meet you, Gai-san.” I replied, keeping my thoughts to myself.</p><p><br></p><p>It then struck me that he had called himself the whatever whatever of Konoha.</p><p><br></p><p>Wasn’t that the name of the village that Naruto was from?</p><p><br></p><p>The village of Ninjas?</p><p><br></p><p>Was this guy…</p><p><br></p><p>I prepared his order quickly and served him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Gai-san, are you perhaps a Ninja?” I asked, curiously.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes indeed. You have a very sharp eye, Silas-kun. I am indeed a Ninja!” He showed me a headband which hung from his neck. “I am a proud Jonin of Konoha!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh. Great.” I replied, having no idea what a Jonin was or how strong they could be.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy… Gai… ughh, this is weird, gave me no time to think further.</p><p><br></p><p>“Awesome! This is the best stir fry I have ever eaten and what is this egg? So delicious. You are a very talented chef, Silas-kun!”</p><p><br></p><p>“I… thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The fire of youth burns bright in you! Light the flames of passion and work hard to make even better dishes. I wish you the best of luck. I will come again the next day.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I… thank you for your patronage.”</p><p><br></p><p>The guy left just as he had come.</p><p><br></p><p>I was thinking of asking him about the basic structure of a ninja village but didn’t find time.</p><p><br></p><p>Are all ninjas weirdos like him?</p><p><br></p><p>Saitama was the next one to leave and I was left to myself in the Restaurant, alone.</p><p><br></p><p>With nothing else to do, I decided to practise my Cursed Energy control again.</p><p><br></p><p>I was getting a hang of it.</p><p><br></p><p>Nanami-sensei said that I was a natural at it.</p><p><br></p><p>Around half an hour later, I heard the ringing of the bell and looked over the counter to see a face I hadn’t seen in a week.</p><p><br></p><p>Sakura Matou.</p><p><br></p><p>She was in her school uniform and drenched in rain.</p><p><br></p><p>Was it raining on her side?</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly went out to give her a towel but found myself pausing at the expressions in her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>They looked so lifeless.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sakura-san?”</p><p><br></p><p>“May I come in?” She asked, her voice almost a whisper.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Please do.” I moved aside and let her enter my restaurant as I closed the door behind her.</p><p><br></p><p>I gave her the towel and showed her to the private room to let her dry herself while I hurried to prepare a bowl of ramen so that she can have something hot to eat.</p><p><br></p><p>By the time I was done, she had finished drying herself too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Here, have a bowl of Ramen. It will help you warm up a bit or you will catch a cold.” I put the bowl in front of her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.” She whispered.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s fine. You are a regular at my place. We could even be considered friends. This is the least I can do.”</p><p><br></p><p>She raised her head and looked at me and once more I was stunned at the expression on her face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Friends?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh… yes. I would consider myself as such, although if you don’t want it then.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No! I… am happy.”</p><p><br></p><p>What was up with this reaction?</p><p><br></p><p>Did she not have any friends?</p><p><br></p><p>Or maybe she had a fight with someone?</p><p><br></p><p>A breakup maybe?</p><p><br></p><p>It was honestly painful to look at her like this and before I had realised, I had already said some words.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sakura-san.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“... are you.. Alright?” I asked, hesitating a bit.</p><p><br></p><p>She froze a bit.</p><p><br></p><p>It was very slight but I could see it due to my recent training with Cursed Energy as well as eating the high quality food from my Restaurant, my senses were enhanced by a bit.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I’m alright. Thank you for asking.” She answered with a smile but both her smile and her tone… it almost seemed artificial.</p><p><br></p><p>She was lying.</p><p><br></p><p>“I… okay. Just in case you know, you have called me a friend and friends help each other. So… if you ever need any help, you can ask me.”</p><p><br></p><p>Her eyes widened a bit and she looked down.</p><p><br></p><p>I was about to probe a bit more when the door to the Restaurant opened again.</p><p><br></p><p>The new arrival was a boy with curly blue hair and grey eyes. He was wearing a  white and black jacket, a black shirt and blue jeans.</p><p><br></p><p>“So this is where you were. Wandering off to a rundown place like this. Who do you think will make dinner tonight, Sakura?” he said in an overly patronising voice.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Sakura and observed that her hands shook a bit.</p><p><br></p><p>She was afraid.</p><p><br></p><p>She still got up shakily.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, I will go and cook.” She whispered, not even daring to look up.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy walked towards her and held her hand. “Quickly, hurry up.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Excuse me. Would you please not disturb my customer?” I intervened.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy looked at me with a disparaging gaze and then his face took on a smile. “Hahahaha I think you are misunderstanding something. This is my little sister. I am just taking her home.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Sakura and she nodded, not daring to meet my gaze.</p><p><br></p><p>“See, I told you. Now, if you will excuse me.” he pulled her by her arm.</p><p><br></p><p>At this time, I saw something.</p><p><br></p><p>The sleeve of her shirt had gone up a bit when he held her hand, and there was a black bruise like marking on her hand. It was as if….as if she was hit.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sakura-san.” I called out to her. She looked at me and once more I asked. “Are you alright?”</p><p><br></p><p>There was a slight pause and her face took on that same puppet-like smile, “Yes. I’m alright.”</p><p><br></p><p>The guy turned around, pulling her by her hand but I knew what I had to do.</p><p><br></p><p>I caught her other hand, making both of them stop.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy turned towards me, first surprised and then with a hint of anger in them. “What do you think you’re doing?” He asked, his anger leaking out lightly.</p><p><br></p><p>“She still hasn’t paid for her food.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh.” The guy was surprised at the answer, certainly not expecting it.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Sakura was taken aback at the statement although there was a hint of disappointment in her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>I merely looked at the guy.</p><p><br></p><p>“I’m sorry, but she will have to pay before she can leave.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh, yes. How much is it?” He asked in an arrogant tone.</p><p><br></p><p>“One million yen.”</p><p><br></p><p>“One hun… what!”</p><p><br></p><p>“That will be one million yen, sir.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you joking? Does this Restaurant make jokes instead of food because you need to work at them more?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I’m being very serious here, Sir. The food Sakura-san ate was a premium item and the speciality of our Restaurant. It was made up of extremely expensive items and does cost one million yen and… I cannot allow her to leave until she pays.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you one of those scammers? Do you know who you are messing with? I am Shinji Matou. I can crush this tiny Restaurant of yours in a second, you lowly…” he went on a rant.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t wait for his rant to be completed and held his hand and separated it from her.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are free to do whatever you want or call whoever you want to.” I replied. In fact, I would be happier if he did call the police and they took notice of the abuse on Sakura. It would at least help her in a roundabout way. With this thought in mind, I continued. “But until she pays the bills, I cannot allow her to leave. If she has to stay here and work out her debts… then so be it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Silas-san.” Sakura looked stunned at my reply.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t look at her and concentrated on the guy before me. “So, if you don’t have the money for the bills… get out.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You!” He gritted his teeth, face red with rage as he tried to punch me only for me to catch his fist with my hand. It was quite easy too.</p><p><br></p><p>While not at the level of a martial artist, I did become stronger due to a combination of my special food and daily work. Especially now, with the added Jujutsu training.</p><p><br></p><p>“I do not like fighting so I will warn you to control yourself and not force me to resort to violence.” I warned before releasing his hand as she staggered a few steps back.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked outraged but I stood firm and so he turned his target to Sakura. “I see. So this is your plan. Do you really think you can get out like this? Do you think <em>he</em> would let his <em>heir</em> get away so easily? Do you think this… this lowly cretin can save you? Ah, little Sakura wants a knight in shining armour, riding on a white horse to save her. But you will only be disappointed and this bastard will pay. I will make sure of it.” he shouted.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked from the corner of my eyes and while she looked pained at the first few sentences, she almost lost the colour in her face when he threatened me.</p><p><br></p><p>… this only made my determination to help her out more.</p><p><br></p><p>“Guest. You are creating a scene in the Restaurant. I will have to ask you to leave.” I stared impassively at him.</p><p><br></p><p>“You! I will see you. You don’t know who you have messed with.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Please leave.” I ordered once more and took a step in his direction.</p><p><br></p><p>He cowered back, stumbling on a chair before his eyes lit up and he grabbed the chair, swinging it at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“No!” I heard Sakura scream but my mind was clear.</p><p><br></p><p>It was as if things slowed down in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>I crouched to dodge the swing of the chair and kicked the ground with my feet, propelling myself with cursed energy and focused my Cursed Energy on my fist instead of my knife as I… punched.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy hurriedly pulled the chair in between us but I didn’t stop.</p><p><br></p><p>What I wasn’t expecting was the steel chair, bending with my punch and hitting the guy’s face along with it.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy went flying towards the Restaurant’s door and coincidentally, at the same time, the door of the Restaurant opened.</p><p><br></p><p>Two girls entered the Restaurant at the same time. They yelped and dodged to the side while the guy crashed into their bag, face first.</p><p><br></p><p>I let out a sigh. “I am sorry. I was just throwing out a troublemaker.” I walked towards the guy, picked him up, opened the door and threw him out.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, and fifty million yen more for the property damage and assault on the owner. Now, get out.” With that said, I shut the door on his face.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>There was an awkward silence in the room.</p><p><br></p><p>I took a look at the girls. One had long caramel coloured hair tied in a bun while the other had short black hair with a bob cut with equal fringes on both sides. Both of them wore sailor uniforms.</p><p><br></p><p>The girls were looking at me, frozen in shock.</p><p><br></p><p>“I’m sorry for scaring you two but the Restaurant is closed for today. You can come by some other day, and I will give you a treat, on the house.” I bowed and apologised again.</p><p><br></p><p>They quickly nodded and ran out of the Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>I turned towards Sakura. She was still quiet.</p><p><br></p><p>Taking a deep breath, I began, “Sakura-san. You called me a friend… and friends help each other. I don’t know the situation at your home but it’s hurting you. It’s… fine to ask for help.”</p><p><br></p><p>Her eyes watered and she shook her head.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s fine. I can… we can help.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No no. You don’t know him. He is… you cannot fight against him. Let me go. I will… I will try to stop him. Please.” Her body was shaking as if she was falling into a shock.</p><p><br></p><p>I had never encountered such a situation before and did the only thing I could think of.</p><p><br></p><p>I walked towards her and hugged her.</p><p><br></p><p>She stifled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Trust me. You don’t have to go there if you don’t want to. I will not let you get hurt. I promise.” I slowly caressed her back but she was still shivering. “If you are worried about anyone hurting me, then don’t be. I will be fine.” I pulled back slightly and looked into her eyes. “If you want, we can go to the police and complain or you can stay here as long as you want. We can find a way to help you….so, don’t let yourself get hurt.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, did I come at the wrong time?” I heard a voice from behind me and looked to find Gojo-san standing by the door. He had a smirk on his face but it faded away when he saw Sakura’s state.</p><p><br></p><p>“What happened, Silas-kun?”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Nanako Hasaba -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>They kept running as fast as they could and when that place was no longer in sight, she brought out her mobile and used her Curse to transfer both Mimiko and herself away from the place.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, finding a corner, they collapsed behind a car and breathed heavily.</p><p><br></p><p>“W-what… what was that monster? That much Cursed Energy... I don’t think even Gojo Satoru has that kind of power. What was that place?” She shouted.</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t know. I had just found out that the imposter that took Geto-san’s body was seen there, fighting Gojo Satoru. I thought we could find some clues about where he is… I didn’t expect to find such a…” Mimiko answered.</p><p><br></p><p>“We cannot go back there.”</p><p><br></p><p>“There is no need to. As long as we have Sukuna’s finger, we can make a deal with him to get Geto-san’s body back.” Mimiko replied and she agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>They didn’t need to worry.</p><p><br></p><p>They can get the help of the King of Curses.</p><p><br></p><p>As long as they had this… she put her hand in her purse but didn’t find it.</p><p><br></p><p>“Where is Sukuna’s finger!”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Shinji Matou -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Cough cough. That bastard. How dare he? Cough cough. How dare he hit me? And what was that thing that I swallowed when crashing into those girls?”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>A day later than expected but I am back with another chapter of ‘The Restaurant’.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Life goes on in the Restaurant and without even realising, Silas has caused havoc in two worlds.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>As for the amount of Cursed Energy of Silas.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>It’s due to a combination of several situations, his being a natural born Devil and a reincarnation being two of them.

The place was old and in a remote alleyway in a town near Kyoto.</p><p><br></p><p>To be honest, it was a bad place for a thriving business but… there wasn’t much I could do.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t have the budget to get a better place.</p><p><br></p><p>And for my current situation, this place seemed to be quite good.</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully it was well maintained.</p><p><br></p><p>If I advertised well, there was a chance I could catch the local crowd for my shop.</p><p><br></p><p>Right now my first priority is to hide from the yakuza.</p><p><br></p><p>I clenched my hands as I recalled those bastards.</p><p><br></p><p>They jumped on me the moment my parents passed away in the accident.</p><p><br></p><p>My property was taken away through forgery and bribing the officials.</p><p><br></p><p>But I was able to sell a large part of it away before they could get their hands on all of it.</p><p><br></p><p>The money I got from those along with the money in my parents' accounts was able to get me this place. A house with the ground floor as a restaurant and the upper two floors for living in this place in the whole other corner of the country.</p><p><br></p><p>And thus, I was here right out of High School, away from the home I grew up in, no family and friends to rely on and barely any money left in my pocket.</p><p><br></p><p>Almost eighteen years of my second life and this was the first time I felt alone.</p><p><br></p><p>I forced myself to get up, open the door and enter the building. I kept my bag on a table and looked around the place.</p><p><br></p><p>The Restaurant space was clean and honestly bigger than I was expecting. It had enough space to hold a dozen or so people quite comfortably.</p><p><br></p><p>It would still need some work before I can start work here.</p><p><br></p><p>My Father used to run a very successful Restaurant in the Tokyo area and my home was far better than this but that was what had attracted the Yakuza.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t need to think about those right now. I shook my head and focused on the work in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next two hours, I cleaned the place and rearranged the furniture according to my own choice.</p><p><br></p><p>The day was still young so I took the opportunity to go out and buy some ingredients for my Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>While doing so I inquired more about the nearby area and also spread a word about my restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>I returned back home and decided to test the kitchen while I cooked myself a meal.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a simple meal. Just a bowl of Udon noodles and soup.</p><p><br></p><p>“Happy Birthday to me, I guess.” I sighed.</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s when the change happened.</p><p><br></p><p>A virtual screen appeared in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>I must be too tired.</p><p><br></p><p>Shaking my head, I sat down to eat.</p><p><br></p><p>The funny thing is that I didn't stop seeing the screen in front of me the entire time.</p><p><br></p><p>Am I really going mad?</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the screen and it only contained a few lines.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Restaurant Level: 1</strong></p><p><strong>Cooking Level: 1</strong></p><p><strong>Restaurant Privilege: Level 1</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Store</strong></p><p><strong>Inventory</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Just to test things out, I thought of opening the <strong>Store</strong> Option.</p><p><br></p><p>And just like that another menu appeared in front of me again.</p><p><br></p><p>Within the menu there were hundreds if not thousands of food items.</p><p><br></p><p>Beside each item, there was a price and the currency changed with my thought.</p><p><br></p><p>… this was too detailed to be a dream.</p><p><br></p><p>Only one way to check it.</p><p><br></p><p>I went down the list and saw a chicken, around twelve times more expensive than the one I bought today. I didn’t have anything to lose anyway so I clicked on the purchase button.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Nothing happened.</p><p><br></p><p>I guess stress is getting to me.</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah. Getting a fantasy type cheat in my reincarnated life… What is this, one of those anime worlds?</p><p><br></p><p>I ate the food and went back to the kitchen to clean up. When I finished, I decided to prepare for tomorrow’s shop opening.</p><p><br></p><p>And so I opened the refrigerator and suddenly paused at the sight in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>There lay a large piece of whole chicken in the Refrigerator… which looked exactly like the one I had just purchased.</p><p><br></p><p>With shaking hands I picked up the thing and observed. It was different from the normal chicken.</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>This cannot be real.</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly tried to verify it.</p><p><br></p><p>The screen was still in front of me so I purchased another thing.</p><p><br></p><p>With my heart beating fast, I opened the refrigerator once more and sure enough, there in front of me was another product all of a sudden.</p><p><br></p><p>… fuck.</p><p><br></p><p>I experimented with some other things and sure enough… it worked.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly another thought struck me.</p><p><br></p><p>Money.</p><p><br></p><p>If the products are real, is the money being charged for it also real? To verify it, I quickly ran to my cash counter and opened it quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>Sure enough, there was money missing from the place.</p><p><br></p><p>I did a quick maths and the amount missing was equal to the money I had used for the products.</p><p><br></p><p>Tired, I sat down on a chair.</p><p><br></p><p>Everything was real.</p><p><br></p><p>I really had a new power.</p><p><br></p><p>Or was it the power of this place?</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t know.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the rest of the night, I explored everything I could about the System.</p><p><br></p><p>Doing so, I figured out a few things about this power.</p><p><br></p><p>First, it didn’t tell me almost anything due to low accessibility.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a note saying ‘Figure it out yourself.’</p><p><br></p><p>Second, everything I order comes from a place called Mathias’ Farm.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, I had no idea who this Mathias was or where he lived but damn this guy could produce some fine crops. Each and everything from his farm was way beyond anything found in the nearby markets.</p><p><br></p><p>Starting from common vegetables to food which supposedly increased someone’s health and vitality.</p><p><br></p><p>The only problem was the price it took to buy those things.</p><p><br></p><p>When I checked the list, it extended from simple, daily use ingredients to insane things with just as insane prices.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, my cooking had improved beyond anything I had ever known.</p><p><br></p><p>It was even better than my dad who was a professional chef for all his life.</p><p><br></p><p>With all these, I finally felt a semblance of support in this world once more after all the shit I had been through these last few months.</p><p><br></p><p>Let’s hope that my new life in this place can be a quiet and peaceful one.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>It was odd.</p><p><br></p><p>Three days had passed and yet… Barely anyone came to the Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>I knew that the location was going to be a massive problem but still, no one even accidentally strayed near the place.</p><p><br></p><p>To advertise, I had some flyers printed and even offered a discount but… to no avail.</p><p><br></p><p>My remaining funds wouldn’t last me long so I needed to do something.</p><p><br></p><p>If someone doesn’t come today, I will go to the main streets and offer some free samples to advertise my Restaurant.</p><p><br>With my dishes I am pretty sure I would get a crowd in no time.</p><p><br></p><p>Just at this time, the door to the shop opened and someone entered the Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked over the counter to see a tall man, over two metres tall with blonde hair and the same coloured beard.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha is this a new restaurant in the neighbourhood? The atmosphere looks quite nice.” He laughed loudly while taking a seat.</p><p><br></p><p>I quickly went ahead to serve the first customer of my Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>“What would you like to eat, Sir?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Bring me a large serving of Soba Noodles and a Sukiyaki. When did you open this restaurant? I don’t remember one in this area the last time I visited.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s been a few days, Sir.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, lay off with the formalities. My name is Furinji Hayato. Just call me Hayato, Mr. Neighbour.”</p><p><br></p><p>“My name is Silas Evans. Please take care of me.” I replied while preparing his Soba.</p><p><br></p><p>“Not from around here?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I moved in a few days ago.” I answered while working on my dishes.</p><p><br></p><p>My cooking skills were much better due to the Restaurant System and this included my Knife Skills.</p><p><br></p><p>Every cut was fine and equal with the accuracy of a tenth of a millimetre.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hoh, that’s some nice knife work. You have got a good potential for Martial Arts.” He said as he looked at me from what was a minimum eight metres distance.</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled but waved it off as a compliment and thanked the guy.</p><p><br></p><p>A few minutes later, I served the Soba to him and took a seat at the nearby table.</p><p><br></p><p>Mr. Hayato is someone with great energy.</p><p><br></p><p>He was apparently a Martial Arts instructor who ran a dojo nearby and invited me to train sometimes.</p><p><br></p><p>While this was going on, another guy entered the Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked like a salaryman.</p><p><br></p><p>“I didn’t know there was a Restaurant here.” The guy asked as he sat down, taking a look at the menu. “Please get me some Ramen and some Tempura.”</p><p><br></p><p>The guy’s name was Mikami Satou. He was a salaryman in a nearby company.</p><p><br></p><p>The door of the restaurant opened and I looked up to see what looked like another salaryman. This one was a bit odd as he was looking around in wonder. with a strange mask filter that he proceeds to take off, too exhausted after the day’s work.</p><p><br></p><p>“Welcome. What would you like to eat?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>He picked the menu up and looked at it strangely before pointing out the same dishes as Mikami.</p><p><br></p><p>I cooked the meal soon and saw him chowing down the food with tears in his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>When he finished his plate, he ordered a few more dishes in the same way and then thanked me profusely.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you Boss. This is the best food I have ever eaten.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh… you’re welcome?”</p><p><br></p><p>He thanked us once again, paid the bill and left.</p><p><br></p><p>“That was…” I whispered softly.</p><p><br></p><p>“A bit odd, yes.” Mikami, who was beside me, replied. “I mean not saying your cooking isn’t great. It is the best I have eaten in a long time but his reaction was strange. I guess he must really like food.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Maybe.” I answered as I picked up the bill when a strange fact caught my eye.</p><p><br></p><p>“The year…”</p><p><br></p><p>Mikami and Hayato looked at the bills too. “Did he just use fake money to do a dine-and-dash?”</p><p><br></p><p>Strangely though, my System did accept the money.</p><p><br></p><p>This thing accepts fake money?</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s catch him first. That’s illegal.” Hayato said as he got to the door. I too opened the door only for us to stop at the sight in front of us.</p><p><br></p><p>Tall buildings, foggy atmosphere and people walking around with gas masks…</p><p><br></p><p>“What place is this?”</p><p><br></p><p>The three of us looked strangely at the scene in front of us.</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t think we are anywhere near Osaka.” Hayato said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Osaka? This isn't Tokyo?” Mikami replied while I had several thoughts running in my head.</p><p><br></p><p>To confirm something, I decided to do something. I walked to someone. “Hello, Sir. Do you have a change for this?”</p><p><br></p><p>Hayato and Mikami probably realised what I was doing and didn’t ask anything. I handed him a bill the last guy had left and to my surprise, he brought out a similar bill.</p><p><br></p><p>We looked at the bill strangely but returned back to the Restaurant before we could do anything.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, what is going on?”</p><p><br></p><p>“This… first of all, let me say that this Restaurant is near Kyoto so it’s not Osaka or Tokyo.” I said, catching the attention of both people. “Just to confirm my doubt, can one of you two open the door?”</p><p><br></p><p>Hayato volunteered and the scene behind the same door changed.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Mikami and he too did the same thing and the scene in front of us changed again.</p><p><br></p><p>The next two hours, we discovered something amazing.</p><p><br></p><p>We were apparently from the Japans of completely different worlds.</p><p><br></p><p>They obviously questioned me on it and I told them I didn’t know how but this power just came to me three days ago. The surprising thing was both of them actually accepting it.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Wow, this is quite amazing. Different worlds. It's like straight out of a manga.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I can't say I disagree.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hahahaha but isn't this a great opportunity? To meet and see the people of other worlds and get to know them.” Hayato laughed out loud.</p><p><br></p><p>Both of those guys stayed there for a while and we talked about a few things.</p><p><br></p><p>I was still eighteen and couldn't drink but they could so I served them something from my side.</p><p><br></p><p>In return, they promised to return and bring others with them.</p><p><br></p><p>Mr. Hayato even offered to teach me some Martial Arts to defend myself.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall it was quite an eventful day today.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x_________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>It's been a week since we figured out what my Restaurant could do.</p><p><br></p><p>As promised, Hayato visited everyday. He even brought some of his friends or rather colleagues with him.</p><p><br></p><p>Mikami and the guy from the last day returned too.</p><p><br></p><p>He said his name was Suzuki and was someone from a future version of Japan. The year 2138 to be precise.</p><p><br></p><p>We were kinda depressed to hear the state of his world.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean they had to wear gas masks outside their homes. The only reason he was without the mask last time was because he was on some work for his office and was given some kind of pills which allowed him to walk outside without being harmed.</p><p><br></p><p>The man literally cried when he saw the current world as it was.</p><p><br></p><p>Really, the greatest danger the human race faces is from themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>But enough of the depressing stuff.</p><p><br></p><p>The Restaurant had customers who needed food.</p><p><br></p><p>I stopped chopping the vegetables to look towards my side. A pink clad ninja girl with black hair was looking at my cutting board.</p><p><br></p><p>Shigure Kosaka was one of the teachers at Ryozanpaku Dojo and the Weapon’s Master of the place.</p><p><br></p><p>“What do you want, Miss Shigure?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Your knife skills… are good.” She answered while not removing her eyes from my hands. A small rat came out of her pocket and nodded but was eying the food instead.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.” I answered while getting back to my work.</p><p><br></p><p>Shigure was just like this. Quiet and eccentric but incredibly skilled.</p><p><br></p><p>She had once chopped Kensei Ma’s, one of her colleague’s hats in two halves… with a freaking rolling pin, when he tried to peek down her shirt.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t even think it was possible.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean where even was the cutting edge?</p><p><br></p><p>“Pork Ramen.” She uttered when I was done cutting.</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded. “I will get it done in a minute, and a cheese cracker on the house.” I smiled looking at the rat who gave me a salute.</p><p><br></p><p>I finished the dishes for the customers and served them before getting back to Shigure’s Ramen.</p><p><br></p><p>Several minutes later, I got their orders ready and brought them outside.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you Silas. Your food is really the best hahahaha.” Hayato laughed. Beside him was his granddaughter Miu who was currently enjoying the food with the other Master’s of the dojo.</p><p><br></p><p>“It seems these food items have a special effects of increasing the effects of training. I have felt slight changes in my body and felt my training yielding better results for the last few days.” Akisame said.</p><p><br></p><p>Curious, I checked the description of the food and sure enough, some of the things promoted Cell Activity.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. The Lettuce promotes Cell Activity and the meat is good for healing minute damages to the muscles due to high intensity training. They also provide insane amounts of energy to consumers.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And it tastes damn good too.” Sasaki-san laughed as he picked up some salad from his plate and took a bite.</p><p><br></p><p>Just as we were talking, someone entered through the door.</p><p><br></p><p>Taking a look at him, he was an elderly man and walked with a slight hunch in his back. He had light blue eyes and tan skin, spiked white hair, thick white eyebrows, and a thick white moustache. He wore a long-sleeved black martial arts jumpsuit, light-coloured pants, and Tai Chi slippers.</p><p><br></p><p>Hayato and the rest of the Martial Arts masters however paused and looked in his direction. The man too stopped and looked in their direction.</p><p><br></p><p>There was an unspeakable tension in the air.</p><p><br></p><p>I waited for a few seconds and decided to break the silence.</p><p><br></p><p>“Welcome to the Crossroads Restaurant, Sir. What would you like to eat?” I greeted.</p><p><br></p><p>On a side note, I named the Restaurant too.</p><p><br></p><p>For a place which acts like a crossroads for different worlds, I named my Restaurant, Crossroads.</p><p><br></p><p>My words seemed to have done the trick as he looked in my direction giving me a nod.</p><p><br></p><p>Hayato-san seemed to have calmed down too. “Please join us. The more the merrier.” he welcomed.</p><p><br></p><p>The man walked to the table and joined him and took a look at the menu, ordering a hotpot for himself.</p><p><br></p><p>I went back to cooking while I heard them talking.</p><p><br></p><p>The man introduced himself as Bang.</p><p><br></p><p>“I didn’t know there were Martial Artists like you in the area.” He said, greeting Hayato-san who explained the power of the Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>When I got his order there, he questioned me too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is it really true that the Restaurant can connect to different worlds?” he asked, amazed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Both me and Hayato-san are from different worlds. In fact, so are Mikami and Suzuki.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So, what kind of world do you live in Mr. Bang?” Miu questioned, looking interested.</p><p><br></p><p>The man explained some things about his world.</p><p><br></p><p>A world of Heroes and Monsters.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a dangerous world and I was kinda glad that my world was normal at least. I mean what’s a few Yakuza when compared to real monsters who could destroy an entire city.</p><p><br></p><p>Turns out that Bang-san was a Hero himself and a high ranking one at that.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wow, are you really a hero? Can I have an autograph?” Miu asked excitedly with a spark in her eyes. Even Shigure had a glint in her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha why not.”</p><p><br></p><p>Although the start was a bit tense, he seemed like a very kind old man. He got along  well with Hayato-san. They also shared a similar philosophy when it came to martial Arts and became friends fast.</p><p><br></p><p>A bit later, I got another customer, from Bang-san’s world too.</p><p><br></p><p>Saitama was someone who was training to be a hero.</p><p><br></p><p>He was interested in the talks about games between Mikami and Suzuki.</p><p><br></p><p>All three of them found this place to be very interesting.</p><p><br></p><p>The Restaurant was getting customers.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I started preparing for the day.</p><p><br></p><p>I opened the Restaurant and a while later, the Ryozanpaku members appeared as usual along with Mr. Bang. They had become regulars of my Restaurant since they found the beneficial effects of my dishes to their Martial Arts training.</p><p><br></p><p>The two had become quite close and even sparred with each other sometimes.</p><p><br></p><p>Quickly serving their orders, I sat down to talk with them when the door to the Restaurant opened again.</p><p><br></p><p>This time two people came in at once.</p><p><br></p><p>The first was a boy with black hair and eyes. He was wearing a white shirt and looked like a middle schooler.</p><p><br></p><p>The odd thing was him looking around the place as if expecting something to jump on him.</p><p><br></p><p>The second one was a white haired guy who looked like he was in his 20s.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Welcome to the Crossroads Restaurant. Would you like to order?\"</p><p><br></p><p>I went ahead and greeted them.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Ah yes.\" The younger boy sat down and looked at the menu ordering some chicken wings.</p><p><br></p><p>The older one just wanted to look at the menu for a bit before ordering. He did pause when looking at me though and stared in my direction for a while.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Do you need anything, Sir?\" I asked, hesitantly.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Nah, I will tell you when I’m ready.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Sure thing. Take your time.\"</p><p><br></p><p>I went back to cook while the patrons started a conversation with the boy.</p><p><br></p><p>A little talk with him led to a couple of discoveries.</p><p><br></p><p>His name was Kamijo Touma and he was from a place called Academy City.</p><p><br></p><p>Touma was an Esper. His city was full of Espers. Even the world had other supernatural humans.</p><p><br></p><p>\"That's so cool. Sounds like an anime.\" Mikami said, listening to the story.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy was also astonished at the power of this place.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Really, this place is a connection between different worlds?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hmm. We are all from different worlds. The owner's shop is near Kyoto but we live near Osaka. Mikami-san lives in Tokyo. Suzuki-san on the other hand lives in Japan of the future and all of these are different worlds. Bang-san and Saitama-san live in a completely different world.\" Miu explained.</p><p><br></p><p>\"That's amazing.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Can you tell us more about your world and Espers?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Espers are divided into different levels. The higher the level of the Esper, the stronger they are. Currently the highest Ranked Espers are level 5 and there are only a handful of them.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"What level are you?\"</p><p><br></p><p>The boy's face fell at the question. \"I am a level 0.\" He sighed.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>\"Oh… I am sorry.\" She apologised. \"But hey, look at the bright side. You can always train and become stronger.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Actually…\"</p><p><br></p><p>On him explaining, we found out that his power could negate other supernatural abilities. And it only worked when touched by his right hand.</p><p><br></p><p>\"That is quite an awesome ability. If anything, it's one of the best. As long as you train yourself more, you could become far stronger. In fact, you should learn Martial Arts to help you.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"She is right. You could always train your body, you know. When you have nothing else to rely on, use your fist.” Hayato chimed.</p><p><br></p><p>“If you want to join, I can recommend the Ryozanpaku or my own Flowing Water Rock Smashing Fist Style dojo.” Bang added his two cents.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the three in a bit of confusion and I decided to give them a push.</p><p><br></p><p>“They are very accomplished Martial Artists. I know you cannot do anything about your luck but you can train your body to become strong enough to be able to survive, right?”</p><p><br></p><p>“That… does sound quite reasonable.” He shifted his bowl near the Ryozanpaku group and began talking to them about Martial Arts.</p><p><br></p><p>It looks like Hayato can get a student.</p><p><br></p><p>Touma joined the Ryozanpaku dojo after some thinking.</p><p>___________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>Two weeks had passed and the Restaurant had two new regular customers.</p><p><br></p><p>Both Touma and the other white haired guy came by regularly.</p><p><br></p><p>The former always ordered a meal here before going out to train with the Ryozanpaku masters and returned hours later.</p><p><br></p><p>It was the latter who was odd.</p><p><br></p><p>He always came in before anyone else, ordered sweets and spent the rest of the day in the Restaurant, leaving when I closed the place.</p><p><br></p><p>We did talk about several things about my world but till now, he hadn't given his name.</p><p><br></p><p>I was fine because the Restaurant was under my control.</p><p><br></p><p>Today too, we talked about a few things when Touma returned.</p><p><br></p><p>“Goodbye Silas-san.” Touma waved but as he was about to leave, the white haired guy stood up to leave too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hello. I guess we haven’t really talked with each other much but do you mind if I ask you a few questions.” They shook hands first.</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm sure.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You see, I am a bit of a magician myself.” He said as he created a red orb in his hand in front of us. “I… please just consider this the curiosity of a magician but can you dispel these kinds of powers too?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh… I am not sure because I haven’t tried anything on a magician before but I can give it a try if you want to.” Touma offered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Please.”</p><p><br></p><p>Touma slowly extended his right hand and touched the ball of red light which completely vanished from existence.</p><p><br></p><p>“Woah. That was quite cool.” I said softly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Amazing.” The white haired guy said. “Hayato-san was correct. Your power is really amazing. Do you mind if we do a few more experiments? I can reimburse you if you want. From what I have seen, we can convert currencies of different worlds in this Restaurant. Am I right, Owner?”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at him surprised but nodded. “Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>He turned back to Touma. “Don’t worry. I assure you it won’t be anything dangerous. I just want to see the effects of your power on different objects. You will not be harmed in any way.”</p><p><br></p><p>Touma looked a bit conflicted.</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t have to do anything you don’t want to Touma-kun.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I…”</p><p><br></p><p>“This will help out a lot of people.” The white haired guy said.</p><p><br></p><p>“I… sure. I will do what I can.” Touma agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Great. My place is a minute away. You can look at it right from outside the Restaurant. When you are free the next day, I can pick you up or if you want, we can work in the Restaurant too… if the owner permits us.” He walked with Touma to the door and went outside first before offering his hands for a handshake again.</p><p><br></p><p>Touma took the hand and immediately a cracking sound came from outside.</p><p><br></p><p>“What was that?” I asked as he pushed Touma back inside the Restaurant and jumped back in too.</p><p><br></p><p>“A cave in. Phew, that was close.”</p><p><br></p><p>We opened the door a few minutes later and sure enough there was smoke and dust everywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>“You can wait here if you want till the fire department clears the place up.” I offered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah… I will be fine. I was just taken aback by the suddenness of the incident.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You sure?”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at us with a grin which looked cocky as fuck. Not exactly annoying but cocky.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ahahahaha don’t worry… I’m the strongest.”</p><p><br></p><p>Before he left, he brought out his mobile and sent me a payment.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is for the experiment today and twenty percent is the owner’s cut. Thanks for the help, Touma-kun, Owner.”</p><p><br></p><p>I checked the account to find twenty million in my account. Twenty percent of that is… woah.</p><p><br></p><p>At that point I remembered something.</p><p><br></p><p>He still hadn’t told us his name.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>Two weeks had passed since that sudden windfall.</p><p><br></p><p>I got the much needed money for myself from a completely unexpected source.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy hadn’t returned since then and things went back to normal… or well as normal as things could get in a place between different worlds.</p><p><br></p><p>A few things I had observed were that some people just couldn’t find the Restaurant no matter what.</p><p><br></p><p>I found out about this from my neighbours.</p><p><br></p><p>Recently, I had distributed free samples of my dishes to the neighbours to promote my Restaurant in my own neighbourhood.</p><p><br></p><p>Safe to say that they all loved the dishes a lot and promised to come visit my Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>It’s just that none of them came.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, it could have been them but when I went out the next day, I was called by several neighbours who said they could find my Restaurant and they didn’t seem to be lying.</p><p><br></p><p>Could it be that no one from this world can find my Restaurant?</p><p><br></p><p>That would suck.</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully, my customers were increasing bit by bit in the Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>Bang-san brought his brother, Bomb and a friend, Atomic Samurai.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, this guy… Atomic and Bomb…</p><p><br></p><p>Those names alone proved that they were not Japanese despite the similar culture in their worlds too.</p><p><br></p><p>They sat together with the Ryozanpaku group. In fact they were also joined by another old man, Isaac. He was a hunter of some kind although he seemed more like a priest to me. All of them talked about Martial arts in their free time.</p><p><br></p><p>As I was thinking, Saitama entered the shop and was soon followed by the other two members of his group, Mikami and Suzuki.</p><p><br></p><p>Today all of them had a holiday and Suzuki had brought over several games from his world, so they were gonna spend the rest of the day there.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t have any problems with them. In fact, I kinda enjoyed having their company.</p><p><br></p><p>Since the death of my parents and me having to flee the place, I had been too lonely. This Restaurant was distracting but when everyone went back… those feelings returned again.</p><p><br></p><p>As I was thinking of this, the door to the Restaurant opened and in came a girl. She had purple hair and the same coloured eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Welcome to the Crossroads Restaurant. Would you like to order?\"</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm, I would like to order some takeouts.” She ordered a couple of dishes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Would you like to eat something in the meanwhile?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. That would be all.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure. I will get it ready in a while.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>Before I could leave, the door to the Restaurant opened again.</p><p><br></p><p>Oh.</p><p><br></p><p>Another guest?</p><p><br></p><p>This time it was a young kid around seven or eight years old.</p><p><br></p><p>He had blonde hair and blue eyes and was wearing a white shirt with a red spiral mark on the arm.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps the most prominent part of his features were the three whisker-like marks on his cheeks which made him look extremely cute.</p><p><br></p><p>It’s just that currently the boy looked roughed up as if he was there just out from a fight.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh? There was a store here?” He looked around surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>I greeted the boy. “Welcome to the Crossroads Restaurant. What would you like to eat?”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy looked surprised at the offer and pointed a finger at him. “Me? I can eat here?”</p><p><br></p><p>“This is a Restaurant so I don’t see why not.”</p><p><br></p><p>A smile bloomed on his face at my reply.</p><p><br></p><p>I showed him to a table. “You can see the menu and choose anything you like. Are you with anyone, your parents maybe?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>His face dimmed a bit at the question. “I… don’t have parents.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Somehow his expression reminded me of my own situation. It hadn’t been long since my own parents died in that car accident and I was so depressed that I couldn’t even go out of the house for a month. And to think a little kid like him would…</p><p><br></p><p>“I am sorry for asking something I shouldn’t have. You know what? To apologise, you can choose anything from the menu. Today’s meal is on the house.” I offered him the menu.</p><p><br></p><p>“Really!” His face lit up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Promise.”</p><p><br></p><p>The other Restaurant patrons also listened to the conversation and Shirgure and Miu offered a seat to the boy who opened the menu only to look confused. He tried reading but couldn’t read properly so they helped him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ramen. Can I get Ramen?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure. I will make the Special.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you Nii-chan. By the way, my name is Naruto Uzumaki dattebayo.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you a student, Naruto-kun?” Miu asked. “Did you get into a fight?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh… no. I lost in a taijutsu spar against that teme.” He gritted his teeth.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, you are learning Martial Arts?” Hayato asked, getting interested.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yup. I am training to be a Shinobi and one day I am gonna be The Hokage dattebayo.” He got up and shouted with a fist pump.</p><p><br></p><p>A what?</p><p><br></p><p>“Shinobi?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I am gonna be the strongest Shinobi of the Village Hidden in the leaves.” he said.</p><p><br></p><p>On asking further, we found out more about him.</p><p><br></p><p>Naruto Uzumaki… was an eight year old orphan who was currently studying to be a Shinobi. We got a basic idea about his world.</p><p><br></p><p>Apparently Ninjas were very common in his world and worked more like a mercenary organisation in cooperation with the government.</p><p><br></p><p>Shinobi of their world did a variety of work from cleaning the garden to protecting important people.</p><p><br></p><p>The Hokage was supposedly the leader of their village of ninjas and his idol the fourth Hokage was someone who saved their village from some kind of fox.</p><p><br></p><p>To be honest, seeing a child being so convicted about his aim… was inspiring.</p><p><br></p><p>In the last few months, I had lost sight of my life due to the circumstances. But now, someone who is in a worse situation than me is trying so hard to live a life and chase his dream… what was I doing?</p><p><br></p><p>I vowed to myself that I would stop sulking and work to make something of my new life.</p><p><br></p><p>Being honest to myself, I actually enjoyed my current peaceful life in the Restaurant.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, Naruto-kun, you said you lost in a spar against someone. A Taijutsu fight?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. It was that teme Sasuke.” he grit his teeth. “One day, I will defeat him for sure, believe it!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha that’s the spirit. If you need any help in Martial Arts, you can ask me for help. I am a martial arts teacher too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Really, you will help me?” He jumped quickly, looking at Hayato.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why not? I don’t see how giving you a pointer or two will be a problem. You just need to get permission from your guardian.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Guardian?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. The one who takes care of you.” Hayato asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh? I live by myself. Grandpa Hokage comes by to give me the pension money at the start of each month.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“You live by yourself?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.” He nodded as he continued eating. “I have an apartment in the village.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And you live by yourself?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“For how long?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, let’s see… for two years.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And where did you live before that?”</p><p><br></p><p>“In the orphanage.”</p><p><br></p><p>Did they just kick him out at the age of 6?</p><p><br></p><p>Those fuckers!</p><p><br></p><p>My outrage was matched by the other patrons of the Restaurant as well.</p><p><br></p><p>Especially the oldies.</p><p><br></p><p>Hayato-san was especially angry.</p><p><br></p><p>He got up and put a hand on the kid’s head. “Say kid… would you like to be my grandson?”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>I was not the only one surprised by the words of the old man.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone was the same.</p><p><br></p><p>Miu on the other hand looked positively enthralled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Really, can we adopt him?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Since he is not in an Orphanage and lives by himself without any guardian… I don’t see why not. But only if he agrees to this himself. A child should not be forced to live by themselves. Even if he does have a guardian… they failed their task here.”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy in question was looking at the old man with shocked eyes. “Wha….?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Would you like to join my family?” He asked as he offered his hand. “You can be my grandson and Miu’s little brother if you agree.”</p><p><br></p><p>“B-b-but why? People… they don’t like me. I am…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then they are blind. I don’t care about what people do. I just wish to ask for your opinion. Normally, children can be adopted from the Orphanage but since you are not living in one, then I can directly bring you with me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes yes. See, we even look similar. Blonde hair and blue eyes. We totally look like siblings.” Said Miu happily</p><p><br></p><p>The boy got tears in his eyes and tried to speak but his voice choked when he tried to speak any words.</p><p><br></p><p>I patted his head. “You can take your time. Getting a loving family is something….very few are blessed with. Hayato-san is a very great man. He will always take care of you.”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at me and then back at Hayato-san and nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“I… thank you. I would love to join your family, Jii-san.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ahahahaha Silas-kun. I just got a grandson today. We are having a party.”</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled and gave them a 50% discount on everything.</p><p><br></p><p>The crowd welcomed the newest addition to our little group with great enthusiasm.</p><p><br></p><p>Meanwhile, the purple haired girl looked at everything in wonder.</p><p><br></p><p>I prepared her order first as she was also invited by the other patrons to join the party. She refused politely but kept looking at them in a daze.</p><p><br></p><p>She did ask about the Shinobi thing and found out about the powers of the Restaurant too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is it real? Can people from other worlds really visit this place?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. You might not realise it yet but you probably are from a different world from us as well. This shop is actually in a town bordering Kyoto.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Kyoto? That’s… quite far away.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh. Which place are you from?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I….I am from Fuyuki City.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Fuyuki City? I am sorry but I haven’t heard of such a place.” I replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s near Kobe.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh. You can still get back home whenever you want to.”</p><p><br></p><p>I walked to the door and opened it, showing her a different scene. “This is my world. Similarly, when you open the door, you can get to your world.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Amazing right? I know. We still have a hard time believing it.”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded lightly.</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, your order should be ready. Are you sure you don’t want to try something?”</p><p><br></p><p>She shook lightly as if suddenly awakened. “Umm thank you but I… am getting late.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. Come back again, miss?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sakura.” She answered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Miss Sakura. My name is Silas Evans. Please visit us again.”</p><p><br></p><p>She left the Restaurant but not before looking back at everyone once more.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>– Satoru Gojo –</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He watched the fight between Aoi and Yuji against the curse which had almost taken out Nanami and Nobara from a distance.</p><p><br></p><p>Both of them had lived thanks to him reaching there in time and using the reverse curse technique.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Sensei, shouldn't we help them?\" Nobara asked, looking worried.</p><p><br></p><p>He didn't answer and just looked in the direction. It took him only a fraction of a second to realise just how badly he would have fucked up if he didn't encounter the Restaurant and the guy Kamijo Touma inside when he had.</p><p><br></p><p>He took two weeks to verify that none of it was a trap from the one occupying Suguru's body.</p><p><br></p><p>The owner also made him cautious but when he did, he took the help of the so-called Esper and to his surprise, the boy was able to bypass his Limitless and touch him as well as dispell the Reversal Red Technique.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a scary technique and yet a boon at the same time.</p><p><br></p><p>One touch could exorcise the worst of the curses permanently.</p><p><br></p><p>Those bastards at the top would have done anything to get control of him or even try to make him into a cursed puppet to control his power if possible and in doing so, most likely causing the ruin of the entire Jujutsu world.</p><p><br></p><p>As strong as his power was, Satoru had observed that he couldn’t even cause ripples in the Restaurant or the owner.</p><p><br></p><p>Thinking about it, a smile came to his lips.</p><p><br></p><p>Other worlds.</p><p><br></p><p><em>‘Are you the strongest because you're Satoru Gojo? Or are you Satoru Gojo because you're the strongest?’</em></p><p><br></p><p>It seems we would know the answer.</p><p><br></p><p>The great food was just a cherry on the cake.</p><p><br></p><p>On observation of Kamijo Touma’s power, he found that any technique or supernatural event was simply erased when it came in contact with his right hand and that’s why he asked for a handshake from across the door, while in the Prison Realm. Sure enough, as soon as his hand came in contact with the Prison Realm, the entire thing crashed.</p><p><br></p><p>And thus, here he was… free.</p><p><br></p><p>The imposter had been able to flee in the time it took him to talk to Touma back in the Restaurant but all his lackeys were still out. He was able to arrive right on time and barely save the lives of both Nanami and Kugisaki.</p><p><br></p><p>And this time, Satoru decided to see things through.</p><p><br></p><p>Since there was such an interesting thing in front of him, he didn’t need any distractions.</p><p><br></p><p>The unregistered Special Grade Curses, those bastard higher ups, the imposter and Sukuna… all of them need to step aside.</p><p><br></p><p>He was pretty sure they would try to put the blame of the whole incident on him so… he would let them.</p><p><br></p><p>Since they think Satoru Gojo is sealed or possibly dead… let them.</p><p><br></p><p>And when they get out of their way, ready to dig their graves….</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe in doing so, both little Megumi and Yuji would progress further… just like now.</p><p><br></p><p>“After today, we are increasing the training of the team, especially yours. Megumi and Yuji will have to train on their own for a while.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What exactly are you planning to do now?” Nanami asked, suspiciously.</p><p><br></p><p>“To finish things.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Hiruzen Sarutobi -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“What do you mean you can’t find Naruto? He’s an eight year old. How could he hide from all of you?” He shouted as the Anbu in front of him kneeled.</p><p><br></p><p>“We don’t know, Sir. One moment he was in front of us and the next he was gone. No matter how much we tried to find him, there was no trace of him in the area.”</p><p><br></p><p>He narrowed his eyes at the statement.</p><p><br></p><p>Several options jumped through his mind at the same time.</p><p><br></p><p>Genjutsu.</p><p><br></p><p>Space Time Ninjutsu.</p><p><br></p><p>But who?</p><p><br></p><p>“Tell me everything about the incident.”</p><p><br></p><p>The Anbu explained and he was dumbstruck at the explanation.</p><p><br></p><p>The only explanation was that someone put them under a Genjutsu and disappeared with Naruto.</p><p><br></p><p>In recent years, the village hasn't been in the best state due to the events of the past few years.</p><p><br></p><p>The Third Shinobi war, the Nine Tails war, Orochimaru’s defection, the Uchiha situation and now this.</p><p><br></p><p>He had the Anbu sent to the T&amp;I department to have him checked but he doubted there would be anything in him. These were the people he had personally selected.</p><p><br></p><p>Kakashi could have been used to keep an eye on Naruto but the village couldn’t afford such a talent guarding someone and not going out on missions.</p><p><br></p><p>Shisui was a good option but…</p><p><br></p><p>Itachi needed to be used to keep an eye on the Uchiha situation.</p><p><br></p><p>Jiraya was always out maintaining his spy network while the less said about Tsunade, the better.</p><p><br></p><p>He had thought that with Naruto going to the academy, the guard on him could be relaxed as he would be in the presence of the teachers of the academy for most of the day. There Iruka could probably get close to him, forming a bond between him and the village. But Iruka still hadn’t opened up to him.</p><p><br></p><p>And then… this happens suddenly.</p><p><br></p><p>Who could it be?</p><p><br></p><p>Other villages?</p><p><br></p><p>The Uchiha?</p><p><br></p><p>Or maybe… his old friend was up to his antics once more?</p><p><br></p><p>He shook his head to clear his thoughts as he sent out a summon for the Inuzuka and the Aburame Clans.</p><p><br>All his Anbu were already scouring the village for any signs of Naruto.</p><p><br></p><p>In a short while several members of the village were in his office.</p><p><br></p><p>Shibi Aburame and several of the Inuzuka Jonins were present. Kakashi, Itachi and Tsume as well as her daughter were out for missions so they couldn’t be here.</p><p><br></p><p>His two advisors and Danzo also came in just in time.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hiruzen, how can you be so careless?” Koharu commented but one look from him shut her up.</p><p><br></p><p>He was not in a mood to joke around at this time.</p><p><br></p><p>Naruto was a sensitive topic for him due to several reasons.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is the case, Hokage-sama?” Shibi asked.</p><p><br></p><p>He let out a sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>“This information needs to be kept under wraps so I put it under an A Ranked secret. If you do not wish to participate after hearing this, you can walk away.”</p><p><br></p><p>None of them did so he continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“As of eight hours ago, Naruto Uzumaki has gone missing.” He stated and sure enough there was a cacophony of noise but he stopped them with one signal.</p><p><br></p><p>“We can stay here all day arguing about things but that will come after we find him. Our first priority should be to find out where he is.”</p><p><br></p><p>They quieted down and he ordered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Shibi, you take your clan’s selected people and search the area of the forests around Konoha. The Inuzuka clan will search throughout the village for any clues. Inform me personally if you find anything.”</p><p><br></p><p>They bowed and left the room, leaving only him and his previous roommates behind.</p><p><br></p><p>“It must be those Uchiha. Hiruzen, your kindness has finally left them to show their true face. Do you think the village can resist another Nine Tails attack? Give me permission and I will…” Danzo began.</p><p><br></p><p>“You will do nothing.” He cut him off in the middle of the sentence, his voice firm.</p><p><br></p><p>“But Danzo has a point. Those damned Uchiha have truly crossed the line.” Koharu started speaking but was cut off by his raised hand.</p><p><br></p><p>“First of all, we don’t know if it was the Uchiha. Pushing them at such a point would cut off any chance of peace. Second, if they <em>do</em> have Naruto, it will be even more dangerous to proceed without caution. If the Nine Tails is released, there won’t be a fourth Hokage to stop him this time. You all… would just run aside and hide like the last time.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hiruzen!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Am I wrong? Where were you when the village was attacked the last time? Trying to stop the Uchiha? You went behind everyone’s back, out of your authority to stop the clan. If the Uchiha had really been behind the Nine Tails attack, they wouldn’t have stopped so easily at your command. But they did. They even accepted moving to the outskirts of the village under surveillance for the sake of peace. This… no one can deny. On the other hand you, Danzo, have tried to assassinate me twice.” He replied, shutting him up suddenly.</p><p><br></p><p>“If we consider the crimes and who to punish, I should have executed you years ago.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hiruzen, calm down.” Homura tried to mediate but he shut him up too.</p><p><br></p><p>“The Uchiha might be responsible for this. I am not denying it. But what matters the most is Naruto’s safety. I will not have your doubts endanger any of it. If the Uchiha are responsible for it, then they will be dealt with in the same manner as well.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You are letting your feelings for the Jinchuriki get in the way of your judgement.” Danzo bit back.</p><p><br></p><p>“All of you may leave. Oh and Danzo, the Root is not to move out of their base till this matter is taken care of.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hiruzen, are you…”</p><p><br></p><p>“You haven’t left me much of an option. Do you think I have no idea about Shisui?”</p><p><br></p><p>He observed the expressions of his friend while his reaction would have been the textbook definition of innocent, he knew Danzo more than that. That expression was more than proof that Danzo was responsible for Shisui’s disappearance.</p><p><br></p><p>If so then with Shisui’s Mangekyou Sharingan, he would have more than enough of a tool to brainwash Naruto.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are also to remain in the Hokage guesthouse under the Anbu surveillance until Naruto is found. Everyone will be informed that you are under a temporary leave due to ill health.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hiruzen, you are too much.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I'm Hokage.”</p><p><br></p><p>All of them left the room, leaving him alone in his thoughts.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at his successor’s picture staring back at him and felt a pang in his heart.</p><p><br></p><p>They owed Naruto too much and it pained him greatly that he couldn’t give him a better life. He had only assured himself that it was for the best of the village and for his own protection but even he knew how hollow that reason sounded.</p><p><br></p><p>To be honest, he was tired and after Biwako’s death… he had lost some of his will too.</p><p><br></p><p>But whatever the reason may be, he will be damned if he let that become a reason for endangering the boy.</p><p><br></p><p>If that required the ‘God of Shinobi’ to come back, then so be it.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><strong>It’s back again as a full story this time.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be slight changes in the plot and I will try to expand the plot a bit more to properly focus on the interactions between the people more.

    "content": "<p><strong>Chapter 33</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Disclaimer: I own nothing</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Chapter 33: The Meeting of the Three Faction (Part 3)</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>______________________________________________________________________</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Damien -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The fights were heating up everywhere and it was fulfilling to see the team I had gathered from scratch able to fight at this level.</p><p><br></p><p>These people were no match for any of my core members. After all, they could take on the leaders of the Three Factions and win. Pitting them against these scrubs was plain bullying.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, not everyone was a weakling.</p><p><br></p><p>I moved aside as a shadow passed over the place I was and a loud crunching sound resounded in the place.</p><p><br></p><p>Loki’s pet son/dog was playing a dangerous game of fetch with me.</p><p><br></p><p>Fenrir kept attacking but not reaching anywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>To others it would look as if I was dodging and fighting it but the actual reality is that Fenrir has been under my illusion from the very start.</p><p><br></p><p>The people who had gathered here today were the main problem makers in the path of establishing peace between the Three Factions.</p><p><br></p><p>They needed to get a good beatdown and the leaders needed a good reason to put forward a proposal of peace.</p><p><br></p><p>In the novels it was the attack of Kokabiel on the sisters of the two Satans with stolen Excalibur swords which had almost started a Great War which had finally let them have a reason to put their feet down and establish peace and the threat of Khaos Brigade gave them a common enemy to work together against and find a common ground over time.</p><p><br></p><p>This time I decided to provide them with similar things.</p><p><br></p><p>This attack would be their reason and Rizevim would become their common enemy.</p><p><br></p><p>I wonder how that bastard would feel if he found out that he was being used as a common enemy to actually bring peace between the three factions which he hated so much.</p><p><br></p><p>But then again, knowing that freak, he would probably be happy and even enjoy himself.</p><p><br></p><p>A wall of water suddenly attracted my attention and I turned to see Ingvild fighting off against Crom Cruach.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Ingvild Leviathan -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She dodged to the side as she controlled several water dragons to face the figure in front of her.</p><p><br></p><p>During her time training with everyone, she had heard about Eclipse Dragon Crom Cruach, the strongest evil dragon alive and his reputation was not unfounded.</p><p><br></p><p>The dragon ran straight into the water dragons, its speed only slowing for a few seconds before tearing through the first one and then the rest one by one.</p><p><br></p><p>Overpowering him with Water Magic alone wouldn’t be possible for the current her. His body was too strong for such a thing. Without any hesitation, she used her Sacred Gear, Nereid Kyrie, further strengthening her attacks as well as weakening her opponent, finally succeeding in throwing him against the barrier.</p><p><br></p><p>Her life had changed so much since she woke up.</p><p><br></p><p>She had never even imagined waking up to the literal creator of the Devil race or at least the reincarnation of the Devil and then being informed that her illness, even the attack on her family, were all plots by other people.</p><p><br></p><p>She had been devastated..</p><p><br></p><p>One moment she was with her parents and the other, she was in an almost unknown world, not knowing what to do.</p><p><br></p><p>Initially, she didn’t even know what to do.</p><p><br></p><p>She had never liked violence and didn’t think she was good enough to do anything against the perpetrators. She knew this and wouldn’t deny it either, even now she probably would have just escaped somewhere and hidden if she was by herself.</p><p><br></p><p>But she was picked up, given proper training and a chance to get back at her enemies. The only condition Damien put forward for her was for her to visit Ophelia regularly to get treatment for her mental health.</p><p><br></p><p>She remembered his exact words.</p><p><br></p><p>‘I can understand and allow getting revenge but destroying yourself to do so is not something I will permit.’</p><p><br></p><p>Who would have thought that the Devil was so concerned about the mental health of his subordinates?<br><br></p><p>That didn’t sound like anything she had heard about the devil from her mother.</p><p><br></p><p>But the surprises didn’t end there.</p><p><br></p><p>Everything she saw and heard since then was completely different from what she had known.</p><p><br></p><p>Unlike the devil, he didn’t rule with violence and cruelty but rather treated the people who followed him like members of his own family</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t discriminate against anyone of any race. Humans, Youkai and even Fallen Angels were all taken in by him and treated the same.</p><p><br></p><p>Vienna, Gretel, Lavinia, Kuroka, Shirone and many others adored him to the point of even laying down their lives for him in an instant.</p><p><br></p><p>At first she didn’t understand this but slowly she realised that it was the charisma of the man who drew people to him. Even someone like Merlin, who was said to have a great hatred for Devils, chose to follow him.</p><p><br></p><p>It was almost like Damien and Lucifer were two different beings.</p><p><br></p><p>There, she had met people who had become indispensable parts of her life.</p><p><br></p><p>Asia, Tsubaki, Akeno and other girls were her closest friends while Musashi, Lavinia and Gretel were like big sisters.</p><p><br></p><p>Sean and Merlin were like big brothers on whom she could depend on and Ophelia and the rest were like guardians with whom she could share her problems with and get help.</p><p><br></p><p>She, who didn’t even know what she would do after her revenge was over, now had friends and a place to call her own… and now, she wanted to do whatever she could to protect this home of hers.</p><p><br></p><p>For that, she was willing to go to any extent.</p><p><br></p><p>With this resolve, she let out all her power as her entire form was covered in a purple energy, looking like a shadow.</p><p><br></p><p>The shadow-like form of hers expanded and took the shape of a massive serpentine dragon.</p><p><br></p><p>The Sea Serpent of the End, the true form of a Leviathan.</p><p><br></p><p>All of a sudden, her power over water jumped by an enormous degree.</p><p><br></p><p>Her opponent was not to be left out either as a shadow enveloped the building where Crom Crauch had crashed. The dust around the building made it hard to see it clearly.</p><p><br></p><p>Gretel and others might have noticed this and the space around them wrapped to isolate them in a different place so that they don’t injure any friendlies as collateral.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, being able to exert her full abilities, she went all out.</p><p><br></p><p>She prepared for his counterattack and gathered all the water in the atmosphere as several enormous water dragons descended from the clouds, circling around her, ready for offence or defence at a moment’s notice.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly a loud roar sounded from the debris of the collapsed building and all the dust was blown apart, revealing the figure of a black dragon, staring directly towards the sky at her.</p><p><br></p><p>It crouched in its position and shot towards her, shattering both the ground and the sound barrier at the same time.</p><p><br></p><p>The water dragons around her responded in kind and raced towards the black dragon while her Sacred Gear both empowered her and weakened him.</p><p><br></p><p>Even with all that, the difference between them was not much and she only held a bit of advantage.</p><p><br></p><p>It went to show the extent Crom Cruach had trained himself to get in the same leagues with the Heavenly Dragons.</p><p><br></p><p>He tore through two of the water dragons as he tried to make his way towards her. She shot a jet of water directly at him, far stronger than any of the water dragons.</p><p><br></p><p>Pushing him back.</p><p><br></p><p>The struggles between them continued but she noticed that the more Crom fought, the stronger he got or rather he was getting used to her attack patterns.</p><p><br></p><p>They clashed once more, before separating a distance and staring at each other.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a fierce smile on the face of the dragon….or at least that’s what she thought it was.</p><p><br></p><p>During this she noticed something. Despite his overwhelming battle intent, she didn’t feel any malice from him. Thus taking the chance, she asked. “Why are you doing this? You didn’t even try to go after others when the space was closing around us which tells me that you want nothing with this attack….then why?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Why? Obviously to fight worthy opponents. I was promised that I would get to fight someone strong enough to challenge me in this place….and I am not disappointed either.” He replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“....just for that?” She asked, incredulously. “If you just wanted a fight, you could have just walked here and asked and people would have accompanied you….why go through all of this?”</p><p><br></p><p>Was this dragon insane?</p><p><br></p><p>She wasn’t even lying when she said this.</p><p><br></p><p>There were indeed many people in the faction who would have accompanied him to a fight. She was sure that they would have even welcomed him for such a thing. And he….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Even the dragon seems to be taken aback by her sudden outburst.</p><p><br></p><p>“Doesn’t matter. I have already found a suitable opponent for myself.” He roared before charging towards her once more.</p><p><br></p><p>She had never felt so annoyed in her life. Angry….sure. Irritated, never.</p><p><br></p><p>The demonic power around her flared and almost instinctively, words came out of her mouth. “Balance Breaker.”</p><p><br></p><p>Her Sacred Gear manifested as blue armour-like scales appeared on her body, making a contrast with her darker purple scales and two bell-like objects appeared on her tail.</p><p><br></p><p>She glared at the annoying dragon. “I don’t have time to play games with you when my friends are at the risk of dying. If you want a fight, you come when people are not in danger.” With that said, all her water dragons pushed him back while she used the strongest power of her Sacred Gear against Dragons.</p><p><br></p><p>Taking a deep breath, she began singing while her water dragons were keeping the dragon at bay.</p><p><br></p><p>The effect was instantaneous.</p><p><br></p><p>His movements became sluggish.</p><p><br></p><p>He seemed to have realised it too and tried to break free of the water dragons but to no avail, his movements became more and more sluggish as he finally fell down to the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>Her Sacred Gear was made to fight against Dragons. In fact, the power which granted her Sacred Gear the status of a Longinus was not its ability to control water but rather the ability to control an army of dragons and bring ruin to the world. According to Damien, it had the potential of working even on the Dragon Gods if trained to its full potential.</p><p><br></p><p>Although she didn’t use this ability and only concentrated on her water based abilities, it didn’t mean she was completely helpless with this either.</p><p><br></p><p>With the fight on her side finished, she descended and sealed the dragon with as many seals as she could to keep him down for at least a week.</p><p><br></p><p>Sitting down on the ground, she took a quick breath and called Gretel. “I am done here.”</p><p><br></p><p>The space in front of her opened up.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, how were the others doing?</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Akira -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“These mutts are annoying.” He complained as he dodged to the side and showered the wolf that had attacked him with Fox Fire, making it howl in rage.</p><p><br></p><p>It was unfortunate that they had an extremely sharp sense of smell to even identify illusions with smell alone.</p><p><br></p><p>“Too bad they were not trained properly. They fight like wild animals. No coordination and tactics at all.” Hagoromo Gitsune replied, gracefully jumping over the nose of her opponent and landing on its head and in the next moment, two weapons came out from her tails and attacked the eyes of the wolf.</p><p><br></p><p>Skoll and Hati, the children of the World Devouring Wolf Fenrir, was their current opponent while their third member was facing the grandfather of these two, the Norse God Loki himself.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you think she will be alright?” He asked, looking at Kuroka facing the God all by herself.</p><p><br></p><p>“I think you know the answer to that already. That said it would be prudent to finish this early and assist her. That God is known for his cunning. Although his disdain for those he considers inferior always holds him back from using his abilities to the highest degree.” She replied before jumping towards the corner of the field.</p><p><br></p><p>Hati’s eyes were injured but its nose was still fine and it was upon her in a moment….right into her trap.</p><p><br></p><p>“Domain Expansion.” She joined her hands in a prayer-like position as a cottage appeared behind her.</p><p><br></p><p>Hati sensed the danger but it was too late to move back so it bit towards her only for it to have dozens of spears stuck into its mouth.</p><p><br></p><p>It howled in agony but the rain of weapons didn’t stop till the wolf was knocked out.</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing this, Akira decided to step up his game too.</p><p><br></p><p>Nature Energy gathered around him further powering his Fox Fire as he shot from his place towards the other wolf that was distracted by the attack on its brother.</p><p><br></p><p>It sensed his attack and tried to bite him only for him to slide under it and punch it in its stomach. Almost immediately, Senjutsu powered Fox Fire covered it, making it roll on the ground to try to put out the flames without any kind of success.</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t give up his attacks. The wolf was strong without a doubt. It had only been due to their advanced skill in Observation Haki, Senjutsu and an extremely well trained physique which had allowed them to keep up with its movements.</p><p><br></p><p>“Since she is not holding back, it would look bad if I did. So, take a nap for a while. Domain Expansion.”</p><p><br></p><p>A barrier spread over the two.</p><p><br></p><p>His Domain Expansion was inspired from the story which their master had published in the manga called Naruto.</p><p><br></p><p>The Manga started with a Nine Tailed fox which was hated and hunted by others for no fault of its own. It was chased down and sealed away to harness its power, against its will….due to the greed and fear of others.</p><p><br></p><p>He had felt sympathy for the fox and to some extent resonated with its feelings.</p><p><br></p><p>The mighty Nine Tailed Fox Kurama had had it rough.</p><p><br></p><p>And the main culprit in all of it was those damned Sharingan eyes of those crazy Uchiha.</p><p><br></p><p>But as much as he disliked those damned eyes, he could recognise and appreciate their strengths and the technique he developed was also based on two of those techniques.</p><p><br></p><p>The wolf which had been howling till then suddenly fell still and collapsed on the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>It didn’t even move and the only indication that it was even alive was its beating heart.</p><p><br></p><p>His domain was a combination of two techniques, Tsukiyomi and Izanami.</p><p><br></p><p>Both of them were based on his illusion making abilities.</p><p><br></p><p>But unlike his normal illusions, these ones went a step further.</p><p><br></p><p>This one didn’t cheat the senses but rather trapped the mind of the target like the Tsukiyomi so it was extremely difficult to break through, especially for beings like these, which acted more on their instinct than their intelligence.</p><p><br></p><p>Its Tsukiyomi aspect made a time dilation inside the mind of the target but it was far more than normal Tsukiyomi. Two months inside this dimension was a second passed in the outside world.</p><p><br></p><p>The Izanami aspect on the other hand forced the target to live a situation over and over again till they finally accepted the solution he had set for them and only then will the technique be broken.</p><p><br></p><p>Obviously such a technique had several restrictions.</p><p><br></p><p>He couldn’t use it on those who had too big of a raw power gap over him.</p><p><br></p><p>He couldn’t use it on those who were not actively trying to kill him.</p><p><br></p><p>All these restrictions made his technique almost seem useless but when all these were fulfilled, it turned into a technique which could break the minds of even the toughest of beings through a cycle of infinite deaths with no way out.</p><p><br></p><p>Fortunately, Skoll had fulfilled all the requirements.</p><p><br></p><p>The wolf lay on the ground almost lifeless for around half a minute before opening its eyes. It tried to get up but collapsed back again from the mental breakdown.</p><p><br></p><p>“Rest. You look quite exhausted.” He patted the head of the wolf before communicating with Gretel and sending it out of the dimension.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, for the last one.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Merlin -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He stepped back to the place where the rest of the leaders were maintaining the barrier to prevent any damage from spreading outside after taking care of the Church people and watched the fight.</p><p><br></p><p>“Azazel is not holding back.” He commented looking at the oldest of the Fallen donning a golden armour and beating the crap out of his fellow sibling.</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t think he is in the best state of mind right now.” Shemhazai commented but his eyes were on Celine and the rest taking on the Fallen Angels. “Still….you took out Strada so easily. I can’t say I can do the same. I guess that makes you the strongest human in the world now. I don’t think I even recognised your attack towards the end.” Shemhazai said, diverting the topic.</p><p><br></p><p>He accepted his wish and replied animatedly. “Obviously, I have been training. As for the last attack, it is called Mana Burst. It’s a new branch of Magic I have been working on.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A new branch? You really haven’t changed at all, have you?” He shook his head with a reluctant smile, although his eyes were still on the ongoing battle.</p><p><br></p><p>He noticed this and patted his shoulder and spoke reassuringly. “Don’t worry. Damien has ordered her not to go over the top. If someone surrenders, they will be spared.”</p><p><br></p><p>“....thank you.” He said, hesitantly. “Did you guys already know this would happen?”</p><p><br></p><p>“He had predicted it. I thought his reasons were valid. After all, it was only a matter of time that people would come for his head. So we prepared. Although there are more people here than expected, it’s not something we cannot take care of. I think this is a good exercise for the kids. They have been training all this time and have only fought among themselves. It was not good for their growth.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So this is just that….a way to gain experience for you guys?” Uriel asked,  he sensed that the man was speaking more out of habit rather than having any malice.</p><p><br></p><p>“What else do you want it to be? We didn’t invite anyone to attack us. We didn’t provoke them. They came here by themselves, against the orders of their leaders, rebelling against their own factions….for the head of our leader. You are lucky Damien is taking this as calmly as he is. If it had been Lucifer….you know better than me what would have happened.”</p><p><br></p><p>That shut him up.</p><p><br></p><p>The others like Sirzechs, Serafall and Ajuka were just watching the scene, probably mentally taking note of people fighting. They were more or less left out in today’s discussions.</p><p><br></p><p>The only one who had been quiet since the beginning was Michael.</p><p><br></p><p>“She is holding Loki back by herself.” He heard Serafall comment on the battle going high up in the sky.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka was fighting against Loki.</p><p><br></p><p>Loki was showering the entire place with different types of spells and curses.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka in return was countering it with her Senjutsu and Youjutsu. Her Kasha Wheel was purifying the curses while her Youjutsu attacks were countering the spells.</p><p><br></p><p>“She is not holding back but completely countering any and all his moves. Notice that none of his attacks have touched the ground and the people below. Loki was using such attacks to distract her to try to protect her allies….but she is accurately disabling them one on one rather than shielding others with barriers. And even with all this, she is able to attack Loki. If it had been a different situation, she would have completely overwhelmed the god.” Ajuka replied, not moving his eyes from the battle.</p><p><br></p><p>“Just….how did he gather all these people?” She whispered.</p><p><br></p><p>“With a little bit of luck and a lot of work. It was not exactly a question of who he was gathering, although I won’t deny it was a big part of it. Damien is someone who could have trained a common human with no knowledge of the supernatural to this level if he truly wanted. He is just that good at it. So in a way, it wasn’t his luck to find these people but rather their luck of being found by him.” He explained. He wasn’t lying either.</p><p><br></p><p>These were his genuine feelings.</p><p><br></p><p>He had seen it with his own eyes after all.</p><p><br></p><p>The Archmage….was a frightening power, even by his imagination.</p><p><br></p><p>At this moment, a communication circle appeared in front of Michael. He looked down and opened it to reveal the face of….an injured Raphael.</p><p><br></p><p>“Brother, Heaven has been attacked! It’s….it’s Satanael and….Rizevim.” He complained through gritted teeth.</p><p><br></p><p>“What?!”</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone at the scene froze at the sudden reveal.</p><p><br></p><p>It then struck him.</p><p><br></p><p>“This attack, all these <a href=\"https://reinforcements….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reinforcements….it</a> was a diversion. Satanael and Rizevim….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Brother, we must leave.” Uriel urged Michael and looked at him. “Open the barriers.”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded and quickly contacted Damien. <em>“We have a problem.”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“Yes?”</em></p><p><br></p><p>“Rizevim and Satanael have attacked Heaven.”</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t need to wait for his words to know his answer as the scene in front of them changed completely.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Kuroka -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Aghh, this annoying bastard nyaa!” She exclaimed as she blocked another one of his attacks.</p><p><br></p><p>He was continuously attacking others to make her defend.</p><p><br></p><p>She was keeping the attacks from landing below to avoid collateral damage but this made it hard for her to attack.</p><p><br></p><p>Still the moment that she was waiting for came.</p><p><br></p><p>Hagoromo Gitsune had finished her fight and the sound of her opponent being subdued diverted the attention of the annoying god for a moment and she threw her Kasha directly at him, following close behind to throw a Senjutsu infused punch.</p><p><br></p><p>He noticed the attack at the last moment and conjured a shield at the last moment, blocking her Kasha but her punch broke through and smacked him directly in the face.</p><p><br></p><p>“You impudent….!” he growled and summoned hundreds of Magic Circles, preparing for a massive attack….only for the attacks to be dispelled midway as he was shot down to the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>She smirked.</p><p><br></p><p>Her last attack was just a cover for Hagoromo Gitsune to sneak in and she didn’t disappoint.</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t stay idle either and let loose a barrage of attacks at the place he had crashed, not letting up for even a second.</p><p><br></p><p>“That should teach that bastard nyaa!”</p><p><br></p><p>“It wouldn’t be enough to take him down.” Akira, who had also completed his fight, stepped beside them and said.</p><p><br></p><p>“I know nyaa. It’s not like we can kill him or old man Odin would be pissed. But no one said anything about not giving him a good beating, maybe breaking a limb or two. That much he won’t mind. I’m sure.”</p><p><br></p><p>A massive aura rose from the place he had been thrown and the god was visible once more with cuts and bruises all over his body.</p><p><br></p><p>“You….you filthy animals….I will crush you all.” He growled but before he could do anything,they felt a familiar aura.</p><p><br></p><p>Conqueror’s Haki came crashing down on the entire field and the next instant, a massive jaw snapped at Loki, taking off his arm and leg.</p><p><br></p><p>To everyone’s surprise, they saw Fenrir of all people attacking Loki. Even the god himself was shocked at the sudden turn of events.</p><p><br></p><p>The Wolf didn’t wait long either and jumped to other places, destroying the attacking armies one by one.</p><p><br></p><p>She turned back to look at Damien who had just been fighting Fenrir till now and saw him looking enraged and flying towards the rest of the leaders.</p><p><br></p><p>“What happened?” Akira asked, also sensing his rage.</p><p><br></p><p>They soon found out what had happened.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“Lavy, Musashi, Merlin, Sean. Celine, Magnus, Asia, Kuroka, Hagoromo Gitsune, all of you will follow me. The rest, take out your opponents. No playing around and holding back anymore. If they resist….kill them all.”</em></p><p><br></p><p>They could feel the rage in his voice. It was even more for Senjutsu users like them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Where are we going?” She asked, trying to understand what had happened.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“Heaven.”</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Damien -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>That fucking bastard….that fucking insane bastard….</p><p><br></p><p>He was with Satanael, attacking Heaven….</p><p><br></p><p>There was no information about this. Not even his closest knew about any of this. Not even Euclid or any of those three clowns.</p><p><br></p><p>I controlled Fenrir to take down the more stubborn enemies after which I simply cut off all its senses.</p><p><br></p><p>The world devouring wolf fell to the ground in a comatose condition as I landed beside the leaders.</p><p><br></p><p>“What exactly is the situation Michael?” I asked, as soon as I reached there.</p><p><br></p><p>Shemhazai looked stunned at the turn of events. “What….what did you do?” He asked me, looking at Fenrir.</p><p><br></p><p>“Trapped him in an illusion.” I replied before looking at Michael again.</p><p><br></p><p>“It was Raphael. He says some people have attacked Heaven. They were able to identify Satanael and Rizevim among the attackers. Apart from them….”</p><p><br></p><p>“What else Micahel?”<br><br></p><p>“There were Grim Reapers.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?” I was taken aback at the sudden mention of the withered Skeleton’s minions. </p><p><br></p><p>“Grim Reapers. They had Grim Reapers with them.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hades? Why would he….” Rizevim….was he behind this as well?</p><p><br></p><p>“We need to leave Michael.” Uriel urged and for once he agreed with his usual impatient self.</p><p><br></p><p>My people gathered around me as well. I had made sure to only call for the non Devil members to avoid trouble.</p><p><br></p><p>Gretel had opened a path for us quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>“I can take us there quickly but….”</p><p><br></p><p>“We can lend a hand too.” Sirzechs stepped forward offering help.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at them. “ I think you all should go back to the Underworld and see what that old bag of bones is planning to do. If he has the guts to send people to attack Heaven, there is no saying what he is up to. Oh, and while you are there, please send him a message from me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Tell him that if I find out that he was in any way associated with this attack….I will kill him no questions asked. If I have to burn down the entire Olympus for it, then so be it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Helel.” Michael began but I cut him.</p><p><br></p><p>“No Michael! You cannot be soft against people like him. They are the kind of fools who won’t give up until you remove a limb or two from them. Diplomacy never leads anywhere with his kind.”</p><p><br></p><p>Fucking Greeks.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you think I am happy about this!” Michael shouted back, taking everyone by surprise when his wings flashed a darker colour for a second.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t know why but seeing that I felt my heart stop for a moment and I completely froze. And when I recovered….an intense rage took over me. It was similar to when things had gone all white during Aria’s death.</p><p><br></p><p>It was the same feeling of having something precious taken away from me or almost taken away from me.</p><p><br></p><p>It was odd, as if I knew why I was angry but when I tried to think about it, nothing made sense.</p><p><br></p><p>But my anger was not aimed at Michael.</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>It was aimed towards Rizevim, Satanael and Hades.</p><p><br></p><p>Michael seemed to not have noticed and continued. “Do you think I am happy with everything that’s going on? Father is no more. Mot….passed away as well….I was there….all that time, right outside the Seventh Heaven and yet, I couldn’t do a thing.” He clenched his fist and I could see drops of blood flowing from his hand. “I wasn’t even able to apologise to her one last time. I couldn’t even tell….”</p><p><br></p><p>He then looked at me directly into my eyes. “All of you were busy fighting among yourself, plotting and killing each other. Even I dragged myself into all this mess. Do you think it was easy to grit my teeth and do everything I have done, even after knowing everything? And yet, I always have to be calm….because it is my duty. I cannot complain, I cannot even act on my thoughts because I needed to support everything which was left. I am not afraid of them,no matter how strong they might be. I bear everything because we cannot withstand another war, brother. I cannot see any more of my family members die….just for my selfishness.”</p><p><br></p><p>He tapped a finger at my chest. “You are not the only one going through that pain, do you understand? So you don’t get to throw any tantrums alone.”</p><p><br></p><p>It was the first time anyone had seen Micahel burst out like that.</p><p><br></p><p>“All three factions have their own problems right now. The Underworld has suffered loss due to the rebellion. The Fallen Angels are the same and we….we are no different either.” He said, looking at the people of the church who were subdued by now. “We don’t know if Hades was involved or not. A war, let alone dragging the Greek into this would only make the matters worse. Such decisions need to be thought over properly. Right now, we don’t have the time for it. Our siblings need our help there.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs intervened. “We will take care of the case with Hades.” He assured, pacifying the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>“And what about you yourself stepping back into Heaven? They would try to kill you on sight.” Shemhazai asked.</p><p><br></p><p>I just gave them a look. “I have my ways.”</p><p><br></p><p>Azazel stepped forward. “I am not staying here.” There was no hint of discussing this topic in his tone. Behind him was a battered Kokabiel, unconscious with his magic sealed.</p><p><br></p><p>He threw Kokabiel aside and stepped forward.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Michael and he nodded “Very well.”</p><p><br></p><p>Azazel looked at Shemhazai. “You should accompany them to deliver our stance to Hades.” He nodded too.</p><p><br></p><p>Taking one last look at the battlefield, I turned towards Gretel. “I leave everything here to you.” She nodded and we all got ready to leave.</p><p><br></p><p>Remembering one more thing before I left, I turned towards Sirzechs. “One last thing. Declare Rizevim and anyone who supports him rogue. If anyone complains, tell them it was an order from me.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Sirzechs -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>They left in a grey mist.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked back at the battlefield behind him….if it could even be called that. They had more or less butchered the entire force of the attackers.</p><p><br></p><p>Today’s meeting had been beyond anything he had been expecting.</p><p><br>Sure, he had come in expecting to know the situation about Devil souls but not in his life did he imagine there to be such secrets hidden behind the Three Factions.</p><p><br></p><p>The actual progenitor of Demonic energy, wife of God and the mother of Angels. The secret of Heaven’s System and the reason behind Lucifer’s rebellion.</p><p><br></p><p>It was too much for him to process and then it turned into something like this.</p><p><br></p><p>“Still, it’s surprising that not one Devil came to attack him.” Serafall said, looking at the scene.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Not one of them came here.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why is it that every meeting with him turns into something like this?” He sighed before stepping forward. “Grayfia, please help them seal off the captives. The rest of us will go back and see the situation in the Underworld.”</p><p><br></p><p>They had more or less taken care of the entire situation. Especially in the last rampage by Fenrir.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.” Grayfia bowed and they left in a summoned magic circle with Shemhazai accompanying them.</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>He stood with his peerage members near the entrance to the Greek’s territory in the Underworld.</p><p><br></p><p>Shemhazai and Serafall were standing behind him.</p><p><br></p><p>The grim reapers guarding the gates had been alerted as soon as they had arrived and had fled in to deliver the message.</p><p><br></p><p>A few minutes later, the surroundings dimmed a little as several Grim Reapers swarmed out of the entrance with Pluto, the strongest Grim Reaper at the lead.</p><p><br></p><p>“What are your intentions, Devils?” The Grim Reaper spoke in a hoarse voice.</p><p><br></p><p>“We wish to meet your Lord regarding the attack of the Grim Reapers on Heaven.” he spoke genially.</p><p><br></p><p>Although he doubted that they would act without the express orders from Hades, nothing was still proved about his involvement and they couldn't make any overtly aggressive move.</p><p><br></p><p>“You wish to question my Lord?!” The reaper growled. “After all you filthy crows and bats have done, you have the audacity to come here and question us?”</p><p><br></p><p>He narrowed his eyes at the man’s words.</p><p><br></p><p>“And what exactly have we done?” he asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“You people entered our realm and stole the souls of the dead for your own purposes. Our Lord only sent his Grim Reapers after them to punish them for their crimes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Who exactly stole the souls of the dead?” Serafall asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Rizevim Livan Lucifer and Fallen Angel Satanael.” He hissed venomously.</p><p><br></p><p>“And yet your people were following the two and attacking Heaven?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“They were tasked with retrieving the souls. If anyone stands in their way, there is bound to be fights. After all, guarding the souls <em>is</em> their duty.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Satanael was declared a rogue by our faction. He is no longer a member of Grigori. He has nothing to do with us anymore. If he did attack your realm, you should have confirmed with us, not directly attacked Heaven.” Shemhazai complained. “Even Rizevim was declared a rogue after his attack on Heaven was found out.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And what exactly would be the use to confirm? Give them more time to hide? If we weren’t quick enough, we wouldn’t have realised that they were hiding among those doves. All three of your factions are the same.” The Grim Reaper shouted.</p><p><br></p><p>“You had no proof that they were together. You all attacked Heaven without any provocation.” Shemhazai shouted back.</p><p><br></p><p>Both were releasing high amounts of power by now.</p><p><br></p><p>He put a hand on Shemhazai’s shoulder and stopped him as he stepped forward and faced the Grim Reaper. “I am sorry to hear about the incident in your realm but still, I request that we speak to your Lord, if only to clear out these matters so that it doesn’t escalate.” He spoke calmly.</p><p><br></p><p>“There is nothing to speak of.” The Grim Reaper answered back, releasing even more of his power. His subordinates joined him.</p><p><br></p><p>He narrowed his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>They were sidestepping the subject and avoiding summoning Hades. It looked suspicious.</p><p><br></p><p>Why must matters alway come to this? With an internal sigh, he let out his Demonic Power as well, crushing all the grim reapers in front of us.</p><p><br></p><p>His peerage members followed as the dozens of Grim Reapers took out their death scythes and took a stance to attack.</p><p><br></p><p>The tension increased and was only broken by the appearance of a magic circle between the two groups.</p><p><br></p><p>Out of the Magic Circle stepped a figure in a purple cloak, his identity clear by that bony face of his.</p><p><br></p><p>Hades, the Greek God of the Dead.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is going on here?” He asked in his raspy voice.</p><p><br></p><p>The Grim Reapers all bowed while the god faced them.</p><p><br></p><p>“We are here to talk about your attack on Heaven.”</p><p><br></p><p>“There is nothing to discuss. My people were just retrieving stolen goods from those thieves. You should go and keep a tighter leash on your people so that such a situation doesn’t arrive. Then again, knowing you people I wouldn’t be surprised if this was just another game of yours. Otherwise, why would the son of the devil work with a Fallen Angel and hide in Heaven of all places.”</p><p><br></p><p>“As we have already explained, Satanael was a rogue and Rizevim has been declared the same. Do not associate us with them.” Serafall stepped forward to reply. “On the other hand, the action you took today has crossed certain lines, Lord Hades.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I did what had to be done.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Or so you claim.” Shemhazai retorted.</p><p><br></p><p>Hades’ divine aura burst out, falling on the vice governor general of the Fallen but the man to his credit didn’t back down either and fought back with his full strength. “Are you insinuating that I am <em>lying</em>….crow?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No one is saying whether you are lying or not Lord Hades….that remains to be investigated. What we are talking about is your illegal attack on Heaven, where we have actual proof of your people actually assisting Rizevim and Satanael.” He too stepped forward and replied. “You have totally broken any code of conduct and behaviour among factions. This kind of action is generally taken as a declaration of war.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you threatening me, bat?” Hades questioned back.</p><p><br></p><p>“We are not threatening you, Lord Hades, merely pointing out your actions to you. You acted outside your authority by sending your people to attack Heaven. This is a fact that, something even you have accepted. But since you say they were stealing souls from your domain, we will investigate it too and return those if we find them. On the other hand, the ones who attacked Heaven….they will also be dealt with suitably.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hoh, and what would the suitable punishment for them be?”</p><p><br></p><p>“That will be for Archangel Michael and his fellow angels to decide. After all, they are the people who lost their siblings due to <em>your misunderstanding</em>. I hope there won’t be any such misunderstandings from now on because in that case, we would be forced to take action.” He finished.</p><p><br></p><p>To be honest, by now he was sure there was something wrong with the situation with how much they were twisting the subject.</p><p><br></p><p>With his words said, he turned towards others. “Let’s go.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sirzechs?” Serafall asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s go, Serafall. We are done here for now.” He replied before turning back at the glaring god. “Oh and one more thing Lord Hades. Since you were curious about our arrival to discuss the matters of Heaven, let me be the first to inform you. Our Three Factions have signed a Peace Agreement and are now in an alliance. If a war does happen….anyone against us will be facing the combined might of all three Biblical factions together. But war is a sad thing and I sincerely hope it will not come to that.”</p><p><br></p><p>The God of the Dead let out his full divine aura and in return he faced the God and removed his cloak and handed it to Souji before releasing the seal on himself.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Shemhazai -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The area quaked as red and purple tinged Sirzechs’ skin. First his eyes turned completely purple, pupils, sclera, everything and the Power of Destruction then spread out to the rest of his body, all the while his Demonic Power kept increasing.</p><p><br></p><p>He had heard of it.</p><p><br></p><p>The two current Satans, Sirzechs Lucifer and Ajuka Beelzebub were called Super Devils, similar to Rizevim, and even among these, Sirzechs was known as the strongest Devil alive.</p><p><br></p><p>And yet, seeing this for the first time, seeing his form morph into what looked like a humanoid mass of the power of destruction, he found his mouth hanging open.</p><p><br></p><p>This power….this kind of power was beyond, it was beyond anything he had expected.</p><p><br></p><p>And Damien was waving him off casually. Was he not aware of his full power or was he also this strong?</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs’ aura kept increasing, even slightly overwhelming Hades’ own as they faced each other.</p><p><br></p><p>The Grim Reapers behind him had all been crushed down to the ground under their auras alone while others were feeling suffocated by it.</p><p><br></p><p>Death and destruction competed against each other for dominance.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the God of the Dead looked a bit hesitant to continue the battle. He let out a snort and turned back, leaving the Underworld, back to his own realm but not before leaving a last line. “War would only start if you fail to control your people and that time it won’t end with just words.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs’ form reverted slowly to his normal one and his knight handed him his clothes.</p><p><br></p><p>He clenched his fist looking at the departing form of the God when he suddenly felt a hand on his shoulder. Turning back, he saw Sirzechs shaking his head at him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Starting wars on two fronts is not a good idea. Let’s wait for them to return and then we can discuss what we need to do. There are too many variables.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You do realise that they are working together, don’t you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I do….but we have no proof of anything. Hades and his people made a point to repeatedly rub their story in our faces and the God was too calm for such a situation to have actually happened. We need time to prepare ourselves while they might already be ready for a fight. Starting a war at such a time wouldn’t be a wise decision. We need to wait till they return and we can regroup together.” He replied while fixing his cloak.</p><p><br></p><p>“....I understand. I will get everyone ready. Hades….he will not escape this.” He said through gritted teeth.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, he won’t. I doubt <em>he</em> would let the matter go that easily.”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded as well. Damien might have been shaken out of his anger by Michael’s outburst but he was the last person to take such an attack laying down.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let us go.” Sirzechs said to his subordinates and then turned towards him. “You should also go and check the Fallen Angels side to make sure no one causes any problems there.”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded and left.</p><p><br></p><p>….this was not how he had imagined this day going.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Raphael -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“What is the situation?” He asked as he healed Ariel’s wounds.</p><p><br></p><p>“They have almost broken through the fourth barricade and are going to arrive at the fifth heaven in a short while. We cannot hold them back for long.” He heard the voice of Jophiel report through the communication magic circle.</p><p><br></p><p>“Make a defensive formation at the gates of the Fifth Heaven. Gabriel will be leading everyone there.” On the other communication circle, he commanded. “Assemble the angels in the first and second Heaven and attack their rear.  We only need to delay them for a while. Reinforcements will be arriving soon.”</p><p><br></p><p>“This much should be enough for me.” Ariel moved and got ready to leave.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wait a moment. I will leave with you too.” He said but Ariel shook her head.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. You should stay here. We cannot lose our best healer and strategist. We need you to hold the fort till Micahel and Uriel get back.”</p><p><br></p><p>He clenched his fist but understood her reasoning. Taking a deep breath, he nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>As he watched Ariel leave, his mind went back to how this mess started.</p><p><br></p><p>Michael and Uriel had left to attend the meeting of the three factions and they were informed that they had been attacked by rebels.</p><p><br></p><p>It was disheartening but not surprising to see many of the Church people rebel to go after Helel.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the likes of Vasco Strada and Edward Christaldi had left to join the group, each for their own reason.</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully, many of the promising youngsters were left out. Ariel had been escorted by two Exorcists when she came back from the Vatican to inform them about this.Dulio Gueseldo and Griselda Quarta were the escorts.</p><p><br></p><p>Led by Kokabiel and his followers were the ones leading the attack. And while he was worried about the safety of his siblings, he knew they would be able to overcome that situation. Suddenly he found himself worrying about a whole new problem.</p><p><br></p><p>Out of the gates of the Third Heaven, hundreds of wizards and fallen angels invaded Heaven. He recognised many of them as the ones who fell and were ousted from Heaven when the loopholes in the Heaven’s System were fixed.</p><p><br></p><p>At the lead were surprising faces, Rizevim Livan Lucifer and Satanael.</p><p><br></p><p>They took everyone by surprise, quickly overcoming the focus of the Fourth Heaven by the time they were able to collect themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>Without Michael here and running the system, many of the defences of Heaven were barely working, further helping the invading forces.</p><p><br></p><p>The stronger angels were not able to release their full powers, fearing the destruction of the surroundings. They were incredibly restrained while fighting back.</p><p><br></p><p>But when they thought they had contained the matter, things got even worse as hoards or Grim Reapers came out and started killing anyone they encountered.</p><p><br></p><p>And just like that, the entire situation went down the drain.</p><p><br></p><p>He just hoped that they could bring the situation under control before more of the surroundings were damaged.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Gabriel -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She clashed with Satanael once more who defended with his sword, the demonic aura of the sword flaring upon encountering her light spear as sparks of power flew everywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>They retreated back several metres, their strengths equally matched and looking at the six pairs of wings behind his back, she wasn’t doubting this fact.</p><p><br></p><p>However, unlike her, Satanael’s energy was not stable. The purple draconic energy she was feeling from him was probably the reason.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why are you doing this?” She asked as he shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why else? To prove myself. To prove that my methods were correct too. To prove that even I could rival you all and….him.” He spoke as he shot towards her and she defended, stepping back slightly to cushion his blow. “And see, I was correct.”</p><p><br></p><p>His distraction gave her the opportunity she was looking for as she quickly conjured several magic circles around them which shot out jets of Holy Water to attack him.</p><p><br></p><p>He pushed her back and covered himself with his wings but she threw her light spear at him, blasting him down to the ground. Not giving him any chance to breathe, she showered the area with light spears, creating a massive explosion in the area.</p><p><br></p><p>She knew it wasn’t enough to kill him but she couldn’t go all out inside heaven or their home would be destroyed. She just hoped to stall them long enough for reinforcements to arrive and push them outside of Heaven.</p><p><br></p><p>Satanael got up, slightly faltering as he had injured his knee in the attack.</p><p><br></p><p>“Powers gained through such means are not your own power, brother. If you do not possess the experience to use it, you will never truly reach higher levels.”</p><p><br></p><p>His face morphed into one of hate. “You! You are the last person to lecture me about how I gain power. You all, who were favoured by Father, just like him, were born powerful while many of us were created inferior to you. How would you know what it takes to gain power?” He shouted.</p><p><br></p><p>She winced lightly at his accusations by steeling herself. “But that doesn’t excuse your behaviour brother. Father didn’t take away your potential. He always did something for a reas….” Her words stopped as she felt a sharp pain on her side.</p><p><br></p><p> Looking down, she saw a dagger stabbed on her side and then felt a smash on her face which sent her flying down to the ground. The wound seemed to have been poisoned and she was having trouble displaying her power.</p><p><br></p><p>She clutched her side and looked up to see a figure with twelve devil wings and silver hair, slowly flying down towards her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Uyahahahaha. This Hades Cap is a great thing. Truly worth it to go through all that trouble. Dearest Aunty Gabby didn’t even notice me till I was right behind her. I can truly become the master of Hide and Seek with this, right?”</p><p><br></p><p>He stood right in front of her and smiled. “Did I scare you, hey, did I scare you? I was really excited to see you after such a long time, you know? Anyways, we are on a short schedule so I will cut this short.” He said as he conjured a magic circle in his hand. “I was planning to leave a surprise for Daddy dearest and I thought long and hard of a plan. He seemed to be recalling memories of his past life and I was wondering how to hasten the process and then I remembered something. He seemed to be oddly reminiscing about old times. when his father had died. I wonder if I should give him another chance to do so by sending his sister off too. Do you think he will recall everything if I did so? Do you?” He asked maniacally as she gritted her teeth remembering the last moments of their Father and brother.</p><p><br></p><p>This man….</p><p><br></p><p>He was the reason….</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, only one way to find out.” He waved his hand towards her.</p><p><br></p><p>She tried to create her barrier but her powers were not obeying her commands.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly, a flash of light crashed in front of them and Rizevim was blown back from the shockwave.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked and in front of her, embedded in the ground lay the weapon containing the will of their father….its holy light comforting her with its soothing presence.</p><p><br></p><p>Looking at the place where it had come from, she saw a figure descending from the lights above as if bringing light in their desperate situation. </p><p><br></p><p>Twelve silver wings shining behind his back and a halo adorning his head as he looked down on the devil sharing similar facial features as him with a look of utter fury.</p><p><br></p><p>The lightbringer had returned to Heaven.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://u5859741.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=8A0qGV6gF6IGDUKSD114nO1Ncu9raWgs4PWRh7nDoZAnX3O-2FhXwP3286H3wyw5UVAkYb_4xUP3YSUyiCjbPXCKeH57s3CV8bjbgWGGHY-2FlPrjSi6-2Fg9vNlejr2YnfO6UGfGgaA0gSJ9NoplEL8DFkoesUvoI6n6M3fEXyTSWr9S-2BKhXmjjO2Kct6t09qruU38VtBfP3zv4TpqsK5nEkaB8s3CgiM7Wq6W4pKYoWMeTBYWSsaNRH5aP7ftqEVxwDx9C7UJgTghzjNWgtpih0fDt1aOoQ-3D-3D\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Wow, this chapter was a pain to write.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Finally, Damien is revealed completely for the world to see….and yes, I planned this cliff.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I was planning this fucking cliff for months, even years.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I was planning this cliff from the time I had the idea about his angelic form.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>So it was finally a relief to get to write it.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Things are turning chaotic as usual. </strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>After all, what would one expect when Rizevim was involved?</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>What exactly are his plans?

What of i…” he suddenly paused, looking at me, mouth opened wide but try as he might, no words came out of them.</p><p><br></p><p>Shemhazai was the same while Uriel just looked confused.</p><p><br></p><p>For a minute, no words were spoken and the tension in the room kept on increasing.</p><p><br></p><p>And when it finally broke, it was Azazel who did so. “You are joking.”</p><p><br></p><p>I just looked at him impassively.</p><p><br></p><p>Getting no reply from me, he turned towards the only other person in the room who knew.</p><p><br></p><p>“He is not being serious, is he? Is this one of his elaborate plans and you both are trying to pull our legs as a get together prank?” he asked, but by now, there was a sense of urgency, dare I say, pleading in his voice towards the end.</p><p><br></p><p>Michael didn’t reply.</p><p><br></p><p>The angels in the room, both pure and fallen, still kept looking at Michael, waiting for him to speak and say that it was a prank of some sorts… but no reply came.</p><p><br></p><p>I let out a sigh and finally spoke.</p><p><br></p><p>“I swear in the name of my Father, the God mentioned in the Holy Bible… that I am not lying.”</p><p><br></p><p>Immediately, there was a blast as Azazel shattered the table in front of us with a smash, his face enveloped in utter rage. It was extremely rare to see Azazel in such a state.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, I had only one memory of such a scene and that was in the Old Testament period.</p><p><br></p><p>The guards quickly got into a fighting position but I waved my hand and they settled back.</p><p><br></p><p>He took some deep breaths and calmed himself down but his anger was clear to see. To get such a reaction from Azazel… then again, knowing him, it was expected.</p><p><br></p><p>“I apologise for losing my composure.” He said but his formal tone alone said it all.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy was mad.</p><p><br></p><p>It did help though as his outburst had shocked the anger out of Shemhazai and he, while not completely calm, was still relatively composed.</p><p><br></p><p>Uriel on the other hand was dead still, not speaking a word.</p><p><br></p><p>As for the devils, they looked like they had stepped foot in the wrong place but wanted to know everything as well.</p><p><br></p><p>So I began. “Creation always needs both masculine and feminine energies. Yin and Yang if you will. It’s the basic principle.”</p><p><br></p><p>They looked at me when I began and seeing that no one was interrupting, I continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“Father knew this too. So… when Heaven was created, there were two beings inhabiting it. Both completely opposite of the other. One represented Holy power while the other definitely had to represent the opposite, demonic power. Not to mention, they were almost evenly matched in terms of power. And contrary to what people would think, they were actually a very happy couple from my childhood memories. I guess ‘opposites attract’ does hold some truth. The first lives they actually created… were a pair of twin children. Michael and Helel.”</p><p><br></p><p>At this point, the whole room was completely quiet, paying attention to the story.</p><p><br></p><p>“They lived together in peace and the two children knew nothing about their mother’s demonic powers. She then showed her other side to Michael… and he was scared.” I looked at Michael and the guy had his fists clenched. It must have been more painful for him later.</p><p><br></p><p>“You know what… I’d rather show you what happened. Don’t resist.” I snapped my finger and everyone fell into an illusion.</p><p><br></p><p>So my illusion <em>did</em> work on these people.</p><p><br></p><p>I played the scenes I knew about their mother.</p><p><br></p><p>After all, I had no idea if I was missing some memories and if I made something up, Michael would catch me instantly.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Shemhazai -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He watched the scenery around him shift into a very family yet nostalgic one.</p><p><br></p><p>Heaven.</p><p><br></p><p>How long had it been since he had seen this place?</p><p><br></p><p>But today… he couldn’t engross himself in this feeling of nostalgia because of the scene in front of him.</p><p><br></p><p>Mother.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>This world was so alien to them that none of them even realised what Helel… Damien was speaking for over a minute.</p><p><br></p><p>Since the very start, all they knew was the word Father. Their very lives revolved around this word. In fact, the entire Biblical Pantheon revolved around this word. There had never even been a word about any Mother.</p><p><br></p><p>How could they have a mother?</p><p><br></p><p>But yet… there was this scene in front of him.</p><p><br></p><p>And Helel’s oath as well as Michael’s reactions, made the authenticity of this scene unquestionable.</p><p><br></p><p>But even if that had not been the case… just a look at the form of the woman in this… this illusion… he knew… he just knew that their words were not untrue.</p><p><br></p><p>This woman… was somehow their Mother… and they didn’t even know of her.</p><p><br></p><p>He clenched his fist and gritted his teeth.</p><p><br></p><p>Why?</p><p><br></p><p>Why were they denied this happiness?</p><p><br></p><p>This was even before any one of them had fallen… or rebelled… so why?</p><p><br></p><p>Had they not been loyal enough… even back then?</p><p><br></p><p>Did <em>he</em> not trust them enough?</p><p><br></p><p>Looking at the scene in front of him, the faces of Michael and Helel… laughing and playing around, basking in that feeling and being doted upon by the unfamiliar woman who seemed all so familiar to him… he felt an intense rage… and jealousy…</p><p><br></p><p>Why could they enjoy this and yet… they didn’t even deserve to <em>know</em> of her?</p><p><br></p><p>He suddenly felt that Azazel’s reaction had been quite tame… because right now he felt like destroying everything around him.</p><p><br></p><p>They saw the scene where she gave Helel his name, Lucifer, the Light bringer.</p><p><br></p><p>One after another, scenes flashed by their eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Next came the scene of the rest of the Archangels being created.</p><p><br></p><p>Unlike the first two however, they were created by both their parents.</p><p><br></p><p>Uriel watched in shock at the moment of his own birth.</p><p><br></p><p>And then, out of nowhere came the scene of their Father sealing <em>her</em>.</p><p><br></p><p>“Just because she <em>could</em> be a danger to the world?” He asked, shocked. “What do you mean she <em>could</em> be a danger? What exactly was Father even thinking?”</p><p><br></p><p>Damien shrugged. “No idea. He never had the habit of telling any of us. Why do you think I had such a big fight with him?”</p><p><br></p><p>They watched as she was sealed in… ’the seventh heaven’.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is that why…” Azazel finally broke his voice to speak. “Is that why no other Angel was allowed there except you three?”</p><p><br></p><p>Michael kept quiet but his silence was a good enough answer.</p><p><br></p><p>The first great argument between Father and Helel.</p><p><br></p><p>He made them swear not to ever speak of her till death.</p><p><br></p><p>It was then that Father created Heaven’s system or rather… a cage for her soul.</p><p><br></p><p>Was it also the source of the system’s power?</p><p><br></p><p>Helel looked at Uriel. “This is why when I tell you something about Heaven's system… you don’t argue. My understanding about the system is second only to Father’s and right now, I am the one who knows the most about the system. Magic was never Michael’s forte. The afterlife in Heaven is also a sub part of the system.”</p><p><br></p><p>At this point, everyone paid attention to the man, especially the Devils.</p><p><br></p><p>“He never exactly hated demonic beings since Mother was the source of all demonic beings in the world. What he hated was the chaos they brought most of the time. That’s why, when someone qualifies for a place in the Third Heaven, they get it… even if they are demonic beings. After all, why would she differentiate between her own children?”</p><p><br></p><p>They listened to him in silence.</p><p><br></p><p>It was Ajuka Beelzebub who broke the silence with a question of his own. “What happens to the souls which do not qualify for the afterlife?”</p><p><br></p><p>He shrugged. “I wasn’t strong enough to make an afterlife for the devil souls. They all go to the world of the dead, you know that parallel plane of the dead which can be seen through the Graal and drives people mad. The very same.”</p><p><br></p><p>Things were coming along now that he thought about it… the reason why Helel was so against humans, why Angels were only created in the Seventh Heaven but could never see the place ever again. He was creating them using both their powers.</p><p><br></p><p>Was she also the reason why he left Heaven?</p><p><br></p><p>It did make sense once he thought of it.</p><p><br></p><p>Keeping all of that resentment bottled up and being forced to guide the very figures who were responsible for their Mother being sealed… there was only so much one could take.</p><p><br></p><p>He still couldn’t understand why Father did such a thing.</p><p><br></p><p>What exactly were his reasons?</p><p><br></p><p>Was there even a reason for any of his actions?</p><p><br></p><p>At least he couldn’t understand any.</p><p><br></p><p>No wonder Helel said that if he hadn’t kept his oath, the results of the Great War would have been far different.</p><p><br></p><p>A large part of Heaven would have left with him and maybe some of the Fallen Angels would have joined him in the Great War, uniting against their Father, making things far worse for Heaven.</p><p><br></p><p>Hell, he was sure that if revealed right now, a large part of the remaining Angels would fall and rebel, starting another Great War instantly.</p><p><br></p><p>“I guess this explains the Falling of an Angel.” Ajuka said.</p><p><br></p><p>They looked at him and it was Helel who continued. “Angels were always made with both the powers. It’s just that Father sealed the other side of the Angels with his own Light and Holy Powers. They also have to follow an extremely rigid path to keep their demonic side from overpowering the seal or it gets revealed and they become Fallen Angels. Their demonic side is still sealed by their lights, because they were created that way.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then… how did you?” He couldn’t help but ask.</p><p><br></p><p>A dark look took over his face which soon disappeared and was replaced by an emotionless one. “I completely removed the light.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>His eyes widened as he understood the meaning of his words.</p><p><br></p><p>“You madman… just what in the nine hells were you thinking!” he couldn’t help but exclaim.</p><p><br></p><p>After all, even Fallen Angels could use light but Devils couldn’t.</p><p><br></p><p>It was because he removed it completely… removed the very part of his soul.</p><p><br></p><p>All of the pieces of the puzzle were now falling in place.</p><p><br></p><p>No wonder he went crazy and became <em>that thing</em>.</p><p><br></p><p>He mutilated his own soul.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone in the room was appalled at his reveal.</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t speak further and the scenes continued.</p><p><br></p><p>They saw him trying to convince Father over and over again, only to be met with a refusal every single time.</p><p><br></p><p>Later on, his thoughts underwent a change as he tried to prove to Father that Humans were really not worth his affections so that he would release her… but they already knew how that would end.</p><p><br></p><p>Then came another shocking reveal.</p><p><br></p><p>“So… Lilith was actually made from…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Mother’s energies alone and shaped into a human.” Helel confirmed.</p><p><br></p><p>No wonder she could give birth to the whole Devil race. She was born from the power of their Mother.</p><p><br></p><p>And it seems that was the breaking point.</p><p><br></p><p>Lilith being ordered to get together with Adam against her will… he could still remember that day when Lucifer had openly violated their Father’s wishes and married her and left Heaven with her.</p><p><br></p><p>Helel stopped the illusion at this point and the room was quiet for a while.</p><p><br></p><p>None disturbed him, especially after seeing a scene like that.</p><p><br></p><p>“I left for the Underworld for several reasons. First… it was the realm where Mother was born from what she had told me. And second… it was the place where her body was sealed away by Father. Wanna take a guess where?” Helel looked at the Devils.</p><p><br></p><p>A look of realisation seemed to have dawned on Sirzechs’ eyes and his mouth opened in shock.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yup. That’s the place. Agareas, the place which was guarded even better than Lilith is the resting place of my Mother. The Agerasite Crystals that you use to make your fancy Evil Pieces are actually normal rocks which were mutated after being in the presence of her aura for several millennia. The aura of the Mother of all Demonic beings. It has an enormous effect on increasing the power of Demonic beings like Devils. Anything make sense now?” He asked, looking at Ajuka who was quiet but Shemhazai could tell that his mind was whirling with all the possible thoughts right now.</p><p><br></p><p>“Before the Great War, when Father was busy creating his trinkets, I and my fellow Satans were afraid of Father and his actions and as a final resort, to resist his power and what better than the power of the progenitor of Demonic Beings.”</p><p><br></p><p>Helel took a deep breath and explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mother’s body was kept in a sealed coffin made from the wood of the Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge. The seals were engraved into the wood itself so that her body, even without a soul, would not completely die. This coffin was then encased in rocks at the deepest part of the island, the so-called unexplored area. It was unexplored because the seal there was made by Father personally, not something you can break. I could only enter it because I knew about them as I was present there at the time of sealing. Not even Michael knew of it.” And sure enough, from Michael’s devastated reaction, it seemed that he knew nothing of it.</p><p><br></p><p>“We chose the rocks directly covering the coffin.” And here his tone took on a serious tone.</p><p><br></p><p>“And that’s where we made a mistake. Our intention was to make something which could increase our powers but we forgot to include the variables. The crystals contained Mother’s energy… raw untamed demonic energy… but they had been affected by the energies of the Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge… gaining their own sentience. And thus, all twelve of the tools we created, turned into autonomous entities with independent wills of their own. These wills which wanted nothing more than the complete destruction of all creation.”</p><p><br></p><p>He took another deep breath and continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“Each of them is comparable to a Longinus. Let me put forward an example to give you an idea of how strong they are.” He turned towards Sirzechs. “You remember the brat, Beelzebub’s grandson who had become a mutated insect of sorts?”</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs thought for a moment before nodding. “Balzac Beelzebub. From our information, he was only a peak Ultimate Class but during that incident, his power was beyond even Serafall’s own although his control had suffered a lot. We assumed he underwent some kind of experimentation.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Experiments would have been better. That fool did something even Beelzebub himself was afraid to do. He took the offer of one of the Malebranche… Scarmiglione who offered him… a tiny bit of its power.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s… insane.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It is. But that’s not even the worst part.”</p><p><br></p><p>Oh, how much worse could it get, he complained in his heart.</p><p><br></p><p>“Scarmiglione was actually one of the weaker ones. The power of their leader, Malacoda… it’s not something you can imagine. If I had to give a comparison, I would say that he is a demonic version of the True Longinus with every bit the power.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The True Longinus contains Father’s…” Uriel was about to speak but stopped midway realising what he was saying.</p><p><br></p><p>Helel looked at everyone with a stern gaze.”So… if Rizevim <em>actually</em> has the Agreas Island in his possession along with the Book of Lucifer, not to mention Malebranche, he… could actually create more of them. They might not be as strong as the original ones but they will still be extremely strong and looking at the replica in Euclid’s possession back then, I am compelled to think that they have been planning exactly this for a while now.”</p><p><br></p><p>The entire room was drowned in a sombre mood again.</p><p><br></p><p>“That brat doesn’t know the horrors of a Malebranche, especially Malacoda. The reason why we were afraid of using them was because they could and would have killed us in our sleep and taken over our bodies the first chance they got and would have razed everything in sight. Malacoda could have directly overwhelmed us at any moment had any of us tried to wield it. That’s one of the reasons why, even when we knew that we might die in a fight against Father, we didn’t resort to using them.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Was creating something like that even necessary?” Serafall asked and they looked at her weirdly so he hurriedly explained. “I mean… the four of you could match <em>him</em> in a fight, right. Especially with your own ‘Denial of the Divine.’ Then why…?”</p><p><br></p><p>He was the one who answered in this case because he knew that except Michael who was not in a state to answer any question, all three of his remaining siblings would have battered the poor girl with words alone.</p><p><br></p><p>“They could only defeat Father because he was exhausted.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Not to mention… he was already on his last foot.” Helel added, suddenly turning many heads in his direction. “Father was severely exhausted and injured even before the war started. That was actually the very reason he even started the war.”</p><p><br></p><p>This was something they had guessed and was one of the only reasons why the Fallen Angels had even dared to fight against heaven back then.</p><p><br></p><p>“I would assume that Father was around five or ten percent of his power in that fight and he still killed Beelzebub and Asmodeus while severely injuring Leviathan… Seriously, girl. Just what are you basing his powers on? Him?” Damien pointed towards Sirzechs. “While strong… Father had to use his injured state to seal the two Heavenly Dragons and make the Boosted Gear and the Divine Dividing. That takes a lot of power. There was only so much he could do. At his full strength, he could have folded him in half had he been serious.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We are getting off topic.” He interrupted, diverting the topic so that they don’t lose their tempers. Today had been stressful enough as it was. He turned towards Helel and asked. “So what exactly are your plans?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I wish to ask for the cooperation of all Three Factions to face Rizevim and his forces… and prevent the Second Great War.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Can’t you locate him? I would think that many of the Old Satan faction devils will be willing to follow you now that you have revealed yourself.” Serafall asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“They do. And they have already been contacted to join me. But this operation of Rizevim is something done by only his closest confidants. It’s nigh impossible to find out what he has been doing.”</p><p><br></p><p>But before any of them could say anything… A loud explosion was heard outside.</p><p><br></p><p>Helel dispelled the illusion and looked at Merlin who nodded and used a spell to check the area.</p><p><br></p><p>“It seems we are under an attack, my king.” Merlin spoke as he displayed the scene outside on the wall.</p><p><br></p><p>On the other side was a gathering of several different enemies.</p><p><br></p><p>Fallen Angels and Humans but he was paying attention to the leaders and quickly recognised one of them… </p><p><br></p><p>“Kokabiel! What does he think he is doing?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s not just Kokabiel. Look on the other side. Those people are from the Church.” Merlin pointed out and on a closer look, they were indeed from the Church, headed by the former exorcists and even some of the current ones like David Cero.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is that Loki? The Norse are involved?” Sirzechs asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“More likely that he came here on his own because Odin and Thor were getting chummy with us. Sigh… what a headache.” Helel closed his eyes and sighed once more. “There are more people than I was expecting.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. The Fallen Angels and humans were expected but the Norse are a surprise. But when we think about it more, it was only a matter of time before Loki got up to one of his so-called pranks.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You knew about it?” Sirzechs asked, surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well yeah. Why do you think I shifted the meeting here? I guess despite using my name you still don’t realise the weight that name carries. Did you think people would just sit quietly and let ‘The Devil’ walk again just because they were warned not to provoke me? You underestimate the stubbornness and idiocy of these people. I knew they would try to do something like this, especially since I had called for this meeting. Many of them are worried that the Three Factions will establish some kind of Peace agreement with me, putting their imaginary vendetta on the hold. As for the Norse, they are doing so because of my alliances with Odin. Not to mention, I sense Rizevim fanning the flames from behind the scenes. How annoying. I guess we will have to put the story telling on the side.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You are not getting out of it so easily.” Azazel interrupted. “You… both of you will tell us everything about… her.”</p><p><br></p><p>He was about to stop Azazel. They had to take care of the problems in front of them first when Helel replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“I was going to do that anyways. But first let me take care of these annoyances.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Helel… let me try to talk with them. They are just blinded by hate.” Michael spoke for the first time since the reveal.</p><p><br></p><p>“You think they are going to listen? These people came here knowing who was taking part in the meeting. They didn’t care then, so what makes you think they will now?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Please… let me at least try.” Michael pleaded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Azazel, we should go too. Kokabiel is out of line this time.”</p><p><br></p><p>Azazel nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>Today was turning out to be one of the most stressful days of his life.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Damien -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The attackers had set up a barrier around the whole place, isolating the whole area in a different dimension.</p><p><br></p><p>I inspected the barrier and found Norse Runes used to strengthen a barrier used by the Church. At the corners along with several holy swords as well as named weapons being used as anchors to hold the barrier together. There had to be at least hundreds, even thousands of people maintaining the barrier.</p><p><br></p><p>It was the standard method of the Church when hunting Ultimate Class beings although it was barely used and never at this level.</p><p><br></p><p>They had isolated the entire dimension to prevent being affected by the Conqueror’s Haki.</p><p><br></p><p>Smart.</p><p><br></p><p>The effect was that holy aura as well as light magic was strengthened inside the barrier and they could even weaken Demonic Powers.</p><p><br></p><p>Loki had obviously modified the barrier as well. One thing people always forgot about him was that he was also a God of Magic despite his usual fooling around.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, there are only a few magicians better than him in the entire Asgard.</p><p><br></p><p>I have to give them this… they did come prepared.</p><p><br></p><p>With such a lineup, I would have fallen had I not been prepared.</p><p><br></p><p>Especially if Loki brought out his sons, not to mention that figure in the back cloak.</p><p><br></p><p>I think I even sensed a bit of a draconic and divine aura on Kokabiel.</p><p><br></p><p>Ophis…</p><p><br></p><p>Sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>I wasn’t trying to test my luck with it till I was strong enough to face the consequences.</p><p><br></p><p>There have been several differences in this world compared to the one I knew. I wasn’t going to take my chances with the personality of one of the strongest beings in this world, someone whom even Father was wary of.</p><p><br></p><p>But it seems that it had gotten involved in this whole mess regardless.</p><p><br></p><p>I saw Michael walk to the front and address the Church people. “What is the meaning of this? Why are you all doing such a thing?”</p><p><br></p><p>The one who answered him was surprising to say the least.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the giant of a man coming at the head of the group and bowing his head in apology. “My apologies, Lord Michael. I tried to stop this but most of us still cannot sit back and watch as the Devil walks on the face of this world once more. He represents the source of all evil, all our sufferings, something we have been taught to oppose and now… watching him sit there, even talking about peace… as if all his deeds were nothing… many of us cannot accept this… and I as someone who has trained them, instilled this belief in them, cannot see them walk to their deaths like that so… please forgive us. Please let them vent out their anger today.”</p><p><br></p><p>With that said, the man drew his sword… the original Durandal and stood in front of the group of exorcists, facing me with a stone face.</p><p><br></p><p>On the other side, Kokabiel was being persuaded by Shemhazai but the idiot was blinded by his own increased power.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why should we bow down in front of him? You are foolish Azazel. You could have continued the war when he had died along with his fellow Satans and Father and we could have obtained our rightful place back but you chickened out. Now that he is back from the dead, do you really think he would just sit back and let everything go. Are you actually dreaming of your so-called Peace again?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Kokabiel, shut your mouth.” Shemhazai quickly tried to shut him up but it was already too late.</p><p><br></p><p>The fool had said something which shouldn’t have been said.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a moment of silence before the crowd of exorcists erupted in chaos.</p><p><br></p><p>Kokabiel looked at them mockingly. “Yes… in the last Great War, along with the Four Satans, Father also passed away. And the one to kill him… is standing right in front of you.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the fool, flying in the sky and gloating at the reactions of the Church people while he stared at me and felt an intense rage well up inside me. Not because of his arrogance… but surprising due to being accused of murdering him.</p><p><br></p><p>The shouts of the fools from the Church didn’t help either.</p><p><br></p><p>I took a deep breath, looked at Kokabiel and spoke. “I am not in the mood to kill today but you are seriously making me reconsider my decision, Kokabiel. But I will forgive your first mistake due to your ignorance and clarify things first. ‘I did not kill him!’ Do not… <em>ever</em>… say that I did… or I <em>will</em> kill you even if I have to burn the whole world for it.”</p><p><br></p><p>Michael was quick to come up and confirm it as well. “He is not lying. He didn’t kill Father.”</p><p><br></p><p>But the fire had already been set.</p><p><br></p><p>The Church people were here to fight and now just had a reason. It didn’t matter to them if the reason was true or not, they just wanted blood.</p><p><br></p><p>“Enough of your drama. This is a war. If you want to exchange words all day, then step aside and let me take care of it.” Loki flew to the forefront and spoke. “Seriously, what even was that old geezer thinking, making an alliance with these kinds of rabble?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. The time for words is long gone. It has been gone since the Great War started. Back then it had to be paused due to the cowardice of some of you people so let me remedy that today.” Kokabiel shouted as he created a light spear in his hand.</p><p><br></p><p>“Kokabiel.” Azazel spoke once more and by now I could sense the anger in his voice. This day had been too much for him, especially after that reveal and now Kokabiel pulling this stunt. “I will say this for the last time. Stop this nonsense or you will be declared rogue.”</p><p><br></p><p>Kokabiel’s face morphed into one of rage. “Do you think I am afraid of you, Azazel? Do you think you can stop all of us? If you do, then you are a fool.” He shouted as his aura kept on increasing. Purple energy with a draconic and divine tint covered him and a pair of black wings emerged from his back. “I am no longer weaker than you… any of you!”</p><p><br></p><p>“What is that power?” Shemhazai asked, stunned.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ophis. It seems Kokabiel was in contact with Sataneel and they have managed to get the support of Ophis. Those are the effects of her snakes. Borrowed power. Just destroy the snake inside him and he will go back to normal. Anyways, it’s a good thing. Now I can find out exactly where Satanael has been hiding.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked back at the group and saw that Michael was still looking conflicted but was preparing to fight either way.</p><p><br></p><p>“Attack!” Kokabiel commanded and the Fallen Angels on the other side were the first to attack.</p><p><br></p><p>“Gretel.” I commanded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, My Lord.” </p><p><br></p><p>Bring up the barriers.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>Gretel used her Dimension Lost to activate the barrier we had laid even before the fight.</p><p><br></p><p>I knew they were going to attack so there was no way I was going to let them run away.</p><p><br></p><p>Ophelia and the rest were currently hiding and powering the barrier, making escape impossible even for Super Devils or similar level beings.</p><p><br></p><p>The attacks smashed into the barrier and shattered, without even leaving a mark.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sean, Merlin. I leave the exorcists to you. Do with them as you please. Celine, Lavy, Musashi, the Fallen Angels will be yours. Kuroka, Akira, Hagoromo Gitsune, you three will keep Loki and his grandchildren at bay. Cleria, take down any of the rabbles Loki has brought with himself. I will take Fenrir myself.” I quickly commanded the group.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let us lend a hand.” Sirzechs said quickly and I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>He quickly ordered Grayfia to lend a hand to Gretel in maintaining the Barrier.</p><p><br></p><p>“Master! What about me?” Ingvild said from behind me.</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled and looked in a direction where none of the other forces were gathered. A single man in a black cloak was standing there, releasing no aura. If not for my Observation Haki, it would have been missed by many in front of such a large hoard.</p><p><br></p><p>“You have your own opponent I’m afraid.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Who is that?”</p><p><br></p><p>“A dragon. And sensing the power I am feeling from him, it is at my own level, a bit higher actually. At such a level, my guess is… Crom Cruach.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The Eclipse Dragon!” Shemhazai exclaimed.</p><p><br></p><p>“The very same. I am afraid we are out of discussion time.”</p><p><br></p><p>With my words said, I flew towards the oversized dog which was trying to bite at the barrier.</p><p><br></p><p>The rest looked at each other and flew up as well.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Sean -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Why does boss always stick us with the Church people?” He asked as he jumped out of the barrier to face the crowd of fanatical exorcists who were led by the giant of an old man.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, was this guy a human?</p><p><br></p><p>Did he start taking steroids in a milk bottle?</p><p><br></p><p>What kind of steroids did they even have in the Church? Holy Steroids?</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s because we don’t have a weakness against Light and Holy based magic.” Merlin replied as he landed beside him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tch, as if that kind of thing was ever a problem for the other members? Even the kids have developed ways to deal with it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Damien’s not the kind to take any risks.” Merlin replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“Too bad we cannot use Conqueror’s Haki in such a small space without affecting our own people or things would have been so much easier.” he complained as he summoned his spear.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s good to stretch our arms once in a while.” Merlin replied as he drew a Holy Sword of his own.</p><p><br></p><p>“Caliburn?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Borrowed it from Arthur for today.” He replied as he effortlessly knocked several exorcists with a casual strike.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. I mean I have never seen you use swords?” He replied as he kicked one of the exorcists, directly shattering the holy sword he was defending himself with and breaking several of his ribs, sending him flying back into the crowd.</p><p><br></p><p>“Who do you think taught Arthur how to use one?” Merlin replied as he sent several different elemental spells showering on the enemy.</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh! I guess I forgot about that.” He dashed into the crowd, destroying the other side effortlessly.</p><p><br></p><p>He suddenly felt an attack from the side and parried it with his spear.</p><p><br></p><p>A large explosion resounded in the area and the land under his feet shattered but the attack didn’t even touch him.</p><p><br></p><p>He saw the man on the other side.</p><p><br></p><p>David Cero.</p><p><br></p><p>Sean remembered him from when he had accompanied Lord Michael to the opening of the bar.</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t like the attitude of this guy.</p><p><br></p><p>Too fanatical for his tastes.</p><p><br></p><p>But what did attract his attention was the sword in the guy’s hand.</p><p><br></p><p>Excalibur Galatine.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the sister swords of Excalibur and possessing the Unbreakable Trait.</p><p><br></p><p>“Spawn of Pagan Gods and servant of the Devil. Today I will rip the Relic of our Lord from your cold dead hands and wipe this disgrace off the face of the world.” The man snarled.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>He pushed the guy and sent him flying several metres away. Suddenly he felt another attack and jumped to the side and the place he was standing on was pierced by an invisible force.</p><p><br></p><p>He spread his observation Haki and realised that it was another exorcist.</p><p><br></p><p>Another familiar face.</p><p><br></p><p>Edward Christaldi. The guy who was brought to his knees by Boss’ aura.</p><p><br></p><p>The sword in his hand was… Excalibur… or rather a fragment of the Excalibur Sword.</p><p><br></p><p>The Excalibur Destruction.</p><p><br></p><p>In his other hand was another sword.</p><p><br></p><p>Excalibur Rapidly.</p><p><br></p><p>On his waist were three unsheathed blades.</p><p><br></p><p>The Excalibur Blessing, Excalibur Nightmare and Excalibur Transparency.</p><p><br></p><p>He was using the effects of Excalibur Transparency to hide himself and his attacks, the buffs from Excalibur Blessing to increase his attack power and the power of Excalibur Rapidly to increase his speed.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, this man was stacking buffs to his teeth.</p><p><br></p><p>“While I do not prefer a two on one battle. This is not a duel and I cannot allow the last remains of our Lord to be sullied in your hands.” The man spoke as he transformed Excalibur Rapidly into a wristband and pulled out Excalibur Destruction.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“You Church idiots always find a reason to suit your purposes, don’t you? And where did you get those lines from… the eighties? Seriously, did you practise that line before coming?” He mocked.</p><p><br></p><p>A two vs one and he still attacks while hidden from behind and now he was pretending to be a righteous saint.</p><p><br></p><p>Sean was not one for blaming others for playing unfair in a war… after all, it was a war.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, he had a very low level of tolerance for these kinds of pricks.</p><p><br></p><p>“In that case, I won’t be holding back either.” He took a stance with his spear.</p><p><br></p><p>He saw the other side making their move. David Cero attacked with an overhead slash. He easily parried it with his spear. But the man in front of him suddenly opened his mouth, exposing a bead inside, emitting a blinding light.<br><br></p><p>Sean jumped back to make a distance between them as he quickly channelled his magic power in his eyes to remove the effect of the blinding.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirstaldi took advantage of this and sent an attack with Excalibur Rapidly which he quickly swiped away with a swing of his spear only for him to bring down Excalibur Destruction on him. Sean coated one of his arms with Armament Haki and punched but surprisingly, the Excalibur Destruction in his hand suddenly morphed into a whip and bound his hand instead.</p><p><br></p><p>Cero took this opportunity to send another attack at him directly.</p><p><br></p><p>He kicked away Cero's attack with an Armament infused kick but in the next moment, the scene in front of him changed as he was still struck by the attack and he was sent flying and crashed into the side of the building.</p><p><br></p><p>Excalibur Nightmare’s Illusion.</p><p><br></p><p>That sword… Excalibur Destruction… was not exactly the Excalibur Destruction but rather Excalibur Mimic transformed to look like Excalibur Destruction.</p><p><br></p><p>How smart?</p><p><br></p><p>The damned old man was quite good at using those swords but they forgot to include one crucial thing in their plan.</p><p><br></p><p>The scene in front of his eyes disappeared as the surroundings returned to the one few seconds ago.</p><p><br></p><p>Observation Haki’s Ability, Future Sight.</p><p><br></p><p>It was an extremely nifty trick and almost made fights too easy so he doesn’t like using it that often in fights but today… he couldn’t afford this privilege.</p><p><br></p><p>This was… after all… a war.</p><p><br></p><p>There was something else the other side miscalculated.</p><p><br></p><p>He used his abilities as the other side got in their position to attack.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Armament Haki.</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>Reinforcement.</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>Protection Rune.</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>Enhancement Rune.</em></p><p><br></p><p>And finally for the last bit of oomph, <em>Conqueror’s Haki Infusion</em>.</p><p><br></p><p>Sparks flew out of the True Longinus.</p><p><br></p><p>David Cero attacked and just when his sword was about to fall, Sean made his move, kicking the man with a full power Armament Infused kick, sending him flying to the other side of the field, before he even had the chance to open his mouth.</p><p><br></p><p>Christaldi, stunned by this, hesitated for a moment but even if he hadn’t, it wouldn’t have mattered because Sean kicked the ground, leaving a massive crater behind him and rushing towards the guy, swinging his spear.</p><p><br></p><p>He defended with both his swords crossed but this was the True Longinus, not a toothpick… hell, even a toothpick with these many buffs could withstand a Holy Sword. And so the result was obvious.</p><p><br></p><p>The swords were shattered and the man was sent flying several hundred metres away crashing into the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>Sean swung his spear before looking at them.</p><p><br></p><p>The thing they had forgotten to calculate… was his own strength.</p><p><br></p><p>These kinds of attacks… he could tank with his own body with just his Armament Haki and Reinforcement.</p><p><br></p><p>Their base stats were too far apart.</p><p><br></p><p>Now if it had been the guy currently fighting Merlin… that might have been a very different case.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the burly giant facing the flower-boy, two completely contrasting figures and yet, the aura they were emitting was deterring anyone from even approaching them.</p><p><br></p><p>Sean himself obviously wasn’t included in these people as he could easily approach and even fight them but unlike these pricks, these two wouldn’t want anyone else approaching them.</p><p><br></p><p>Sean had heard of Vasco Strada and actually respected the man quite a bit and so, he turned towards the rest of the Church people and moved to face them.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Merlin -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Today’s meeting was going as Damien had planned. The number of people who attacked the meeting was a bit unexpected but not something which they couldn’t manage.</p><p><br></p><p>To be honest, even he hadn’t known about God’s wife.</p><p><br></p><p>The deepest secret of Heaven and the true history behind the birth of Angels.</p><p><br></p><p>He could understand the surprise and shock of the other parties, especially the Fallen Angels, who were cast out of Heaven by their Father while not even knowing that they had a Mother.</p><p><br></p><p>When considering their situations, he actually felt a bit of pity for them.</p><p><br></p><p>Does that mean God’s decision was wrong?</p><p><br></p><p>Not really.</p><p><br></p><p>His way of handling the matter might have been a bit different but without knowing every aspect of the situation, hardly anyone could say that he had been wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>And this thought of his was mirrored by his King too.</p><p><br></p><p>Unlike the last time, Damien actually wanted to know the reason behind his Father’s actions.</p><p><br></p><p>If the man was under so much pain… then why did he take such actions?</p><p><br></p><p>And as his advisor, Merlin supported his King’s pursuit of truth. After all, this was leagues better than his approach in his last life… talk about going extreme.</p><p><br></p><p>This Lucifer however was completely different from the last one.</p><p><br></p><p>Having a full soul was doing wonders for the man. The mutilated soul was also explained when he regained the memories of his previous life.</p><p><br></p><p>The current Damien was a perfect balance between Holy and Demonic, between ‘The Lightbringer’, the brightest Angel of God and ‘The Devil’ and this was something Merlin could get behind.</p><p><br></p><p>The effect of his actions was already evident on the Underworld.</p><p><br></p><p>With just one appearance, he cleared a large part of the problems in the Underworld and brought it back to its tracks and if his plans really succeeded, then the world will truly see true peace between the Three Factions for the first time.</p><p><br></p><p>To bring the Three Factions together using Rizevim as a common enemy… was a crazy but good plan. After all, the Angels were already out for Rizevim's blood after the glimpse of their Father's last moments and now even the Fallen Angels will join the boat even if only to retrieve the body of their Mother.</p><p><br></p><p>With just a few actions, he turned the entire Three Factions into his attack dogs against Rizevim.</p><p><br></p><p>Or maybe he was just doing this to spite Rizevim. Using him, someone who desires chaos and destruction… to bring peace… ah what irony. Seriously… he could actually see Damien doing such a thing.</p><p><br></p><p>Despite his relatively calm nature now, he was still extremely vindictive.</p><p><br></p><p>He wondered what kind of face Rizevim would make if he knew about Damien’s plan.</p><p><br></p><p>But to get there, this battle was an important step.</p><p><br></p><p>He stood in front of the man exuding an enormous amount of Holy Aura which wouldn’t be off on a Seraph but certainly would shock anyone when it appeared in a human.</p><p><br></p><p>The strongest Human in the world, the violence of Heaven and the wielder of the Holy Sword Durandal, Vasco Strada.</p><p><br></p><p>And Merlin could see that his fame was not unwarranted either.</p><p><br></p><p>They heard a sound in the distance and saw Sean taking down both David Cero and Edward Christaldi in a mere instant.</p><p><br></p><p>“Your companion is quite able. The Child of Light and the student of the Witch of Dún Scáith. He is truly the strongest wielder of the Lord’s Spear since the Lord himself. David and Edward’s defeat was truly not unjust.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well yes. He does have great skill with the spear but you are wrong about something.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sean is the third strongest wielder of the True Longinus.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man didn’t understand his comment but didn’t pay attention to it either.</p><p><br></p><p>“Never in my dreams did I imagine that I would one day face you, the teacher of Arthur Pendragon, one of the greatest Heroes to ever have been born, especially considering the relationship between the Pendragon Family and the Church.” Vasco spoke.</p><p><br></p><p>“The Church has always been quite ungrateful when it comes to remembering me. After all, they unilaterally declared any magic created by me as heretic. That’s… not quite something one would do to people they have good relations with.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Those magic, while helpful to humanity, were based on Devil’s Magic and thus something against our principles.” Vasco replied, without any anger in his voice.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! Then what about the Church using Demonic Swords like Gram until recently which, might I remind you… were also from your so-called ‘Pagan Gods’?” He made air quotes with both his hands.</p><p><br></p><p>“It was not one of my choices. Unfortunately, the Church is also an organisation and I cannot impose my own views on everyone. All I can do is fulfil my duty honestly and leave everything to the Almighty.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You… do know…” Merlin questioned.</p><p><br></p><p>“He is… and will always remain in our hearts as we live our lives according to our teachings.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Fair enough. I can respect that. It’s something I rarely see from the fanatics of the Church. Belief is after all a very strong driving force. Yours drives you while mine drives me. It’s just that we are on different sides, a simple case of difference in beliefs leading to conflicts.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Since you already understand this, let’s not waste any time on words. I too want to see how I would compare to the Master of the legendary King of Camelot.” The man took a stance with Durandal, which, despite being a sword bigger than his Caliburn, looked like an oversized knife in his hands.</p><p><br></p><p>“Very well. Then let me experience the strength of the strongest human…” He too took a stance with the Caliburn.</p><p><br></p><p>Defeating him with Magic would be too easy but this guy had challenged him as a swordsman, using the name of his favourite disciple. Merlin couldn’t back down on this challenge… for old time’s sake.</p><p><br></p><p>For a moment, there were no movements between the two of them as both their auras completely calmed… and then, as if by an invisible signal, both of them shot out from their respective places, and clashed in the middle of the field.</p><p><br></p><p>Vasco Strada had immense strength but Merlin could feel it in just a single clash that he was not just a musclehead. The man was also an amazing swordsman.</p><p><br></p><p>They continuously clashed with one another and each of his attacks were lethal, filled to the brim with Holy Aura.</p><p><br></p><p>Durandal was a sword unlike Excalibur or Caliburn. It was focused totally on destruction. A blade which didn’t like being restrained and with the trait to cut any obstacle in its path.</p><p><br></p><p>Merlin was sure that had it been some other blade instead of Caliburn, it would have cracked already.</p><p><br></p><p>The man’s skill was approaching Arthur’s and had he been a bit younger, he might have even had the ability to face Arthur himself… although winning would have been doubtful.</p><p><br></p><p>After all, Arthur might not have been the best swordsman in Camelot but… he was certainly the strongest.</p><p><br></p><p>Everywhere they clashed, the ground was torn apart, sending shockwaves all around the place, blowing away anyone who dared to come near.</p><p><br></p><p>Some Fallen Angels had tried to sneak attack them during the clash. After all, this was a flimsy alliance at best. But their light spears were torn apart by the aura and shockwaves of their clashes.</p><p><br></p><p>And in the next moment, he sensed those fallen angels being devoured by a wave of Holy Flames, leaving no traces of them behind.</p><p><br></p><p>But neither he nor his opponent paid more than a wisp of attention on the other side. They clashed for a final time and made a distance between them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Your skills are indeed the best I have faced in all my life. I can see how you could teach someone like Arthur Pengragon.” The man said, catching a short breath before raising Durandal as his Holy Aura poured into the sword like mad and he slashed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Says the man who can beat Ultimate Class beings senseless with his bare hands.” He didn’t hold back and poured his own magic in Caliburn, and countered his opponent's slash.</p><p><br></p><p>Right when he was about to overcome the slash, the attack was ripped apart… from the other side and a fist the size of a bucket, covered in Holy Aura came from the attack, punching him and sending him flying.</p><p><br></p><p>This insane bastard…</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha.” Merlin couldn’t help but laugh as he jumped to the side to dodge the slash of Durandal in the place where he had crashed and quickly got on his feet.</p><p><br></p><p>He still wasn’t proficient in Observation Haki to use Future Sight but he was still proficient enough to catch the attack at the last moment and coat his body in Armament Haki, diverting the damage so he was more or less fine but still… it seemed that he had underestimated the guy.</p><p><br></p><p>To risk his arm just to get a chance to get a hit on him…</p><p><br></p><p>Such dedication and madness… deserved a suitable response.</p><p><br></p><p>In that case… he would stop holding back too.</p><p><br></p><p>In the next moment, he let loose on his magic completely, blowing against the man who was trying to follow up with another attack. Strada plunged his sword into the ground, and steadied himself.</p><p><br></p><p>But Merlin didn’t give him any chance to take a breath.</p><p><br></p><p>Mana Burst.</p><p><br></p><p>In the next instant, he was right above Vasco Strada and slashed down his Caliburn infusing it with Mana Burst Light, making the sword shine with a blinding light.</p><p><br></p><p>Vasco Strada drew another blade from his back and blocked with both swords.</p><p><br></p><p>Durandal and Excalibur Destruction.</p><p><br></p><p>Caliburn directly tore through Excalibur Destruction and sent Durandal flying from his hands as a large gash appeared on Vasco Strada’s chest, sending him flying into the corner of the barrier.</p><p><br></p><p>The amount of Mana he had put in the attack made sure that he wouldn’t die but the light in the attack would make sure that he didn’t get up anytime soon.</p><p><br></p><p>The entire battlefield had quieted down in that instant as they looked at him.</p><p><br></p><p>Especially the church people. Some of them dropped their swords in fear at the sight.</p><p><br></p><p>After all, this was the strongest exorcist of the Church for decades, the strongest human… or rather… the former strongest human in the world.</p><p><br></p><p>And from what Merlin knew, Sean, Musashi and he himself were all stronger than the current Vasco Strada.</p><p><br></p><p>The difference in their powers were… just too great.</p><p><br></p><p>He turned towards the rest of the battlefields and sheathed Caliburn.</p><p><br></p><p>Since it had come to this, he might as well get a bit serious and let loose a bit.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Satanael -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“My Lord. The fight has started. They were already prepared.” One of his subordinates reported through a magic circle.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. Keep an eye on the situation.” He cut off the communication and looked behind at the group gathered behind him.</p><p><br></p><p>Rizevim Livan Lucifer… how did he get the support of that ancient skeleton?.</p><p><br></p><p>The thousands of Grim Reapers were exuding a chilling aura as they lined up in a group.</p><p><br></p><p>Had it not been for the support of Ophis on his side, he might have found the first opportunity and left this place.</p><p><br></p><p>Things were getting beyond what he had expected at the start. But now, that it had come to this… there was no backing down.</p><p><br></p><p>“They have started fighting. They were already prepared so it won’t distract them for too long. We need to take action now.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Uyahahahaha. As expected of dear Dad. He was always great at surprising everyone. But I wonder… how will he like our surprise? Let’s go Uncle. Make this day a memorable one for dear Dad.”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded and they teleported.</p><p>___________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><a href=\"https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://subscribestar.adult/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><strong>Wow….this one took a lot out of me.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Things are getting heated up.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Azazel and Shemhazai had their minds blown.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Uriel is contemplating the meaning of his existence.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>While Sirzechs and the rest are feeling completely out of place, stuck between the Family Drama of the Three Factions.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>On the other hand, Sean and Merlin completely crushed the Church Side.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The match being one sided was a given seeing as how much they had overprepared for years.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Damien is playing 5D Chess with everyone while Rizevim is planning to play baseball.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>What will be the result of all this?</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Keep tuned to know this in the upcoming chapters.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enjoy the new Chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br><br><br></p><p> </p><p><br><br><br><br><br></p>",

But are you sure all this is necessary? We could take them out even if they attacked.” Sean asked, confused. “On second thought, how did you even know who is going to attack?”</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“A conference of the Three Factions….without attacks….just doesn’t feel right. Even more so when the Devil himself is calling for the said conference.”</p><p><br></p><p>“....I don’t get it.” He looked even more confused.</p><p><br></p><p>“Remember the Fallen prisoners we had released?” Merlin asked.</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“They were made to sign contracts with us. Damien had them enter the groups of the Fallen Angel cadres who were antagonistic towards him in general. Safe to say that almost all of them were selected, getting us an insight into all the actions of those cadres. From there, we got some information about what a few of them are planning and made preparations for those.” Merlin explained the plan.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. So….do we get to fight?” he asked excitedly.</p><p><br></p><p>“If they attack even after our preparations, then why not?”</p><p><br></p><p>“What’s the situation with the Shinto?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“They….have been extremely quiet since the disappearance of the Gokadoin Clan. Apparently, none of them were expecting such a counterattack and are reconsidering things. It also all but confirmed the ties between us and the Nura Clan. They must be reconsidering their plans.”</p><p><br></p><p>Hmm.</p><p><br></p><p>“They would probably play the blame game with the Nura Clan and then descend themselves to play the saviour. Did you get the connection of the Shinto Gods behind the whole incident?”</p><p><br></p><p>“A few yes. But if we want to implicate the whole faction, we would need more or they will just say that those few were rebels and wave things off and if they are more shameless, they would just pretend the information to be false.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s go with the shameless part then. That’s something most of the Gods, especially the weaker ones have the most experience in being one.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well….I can’t deny that.” Merlin shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>I discussed a few more things with them before leaving the place where the rest were training.</p><p><br></p><p>We had increased the training of the kids especially since Albion started teaching Vienna his own Divide and other techniques.</p><p><br></p><p>Hagoromo Gitsune and Merlin taught Valerie about her Sacred Gear and even I sometimes joined in and taught her a few things to protect her mind against the mental corrosion of the Sephiroth Graal.</p><p><br></p><p>She was progressing quite quickly, especially with a nerfed Archmage and King’s Essence.</p><p><br></p><p>I recalled how the Sephiroth Graal was used in canon and felt how dumb those people were to use it like that.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, they made a million autonomous Boosted Gear Scale Mails, each with the power of a Middle Class being….and what did they do?</p><p><br></p><p>Just sent those mindless scale mails to attack in a bunch….</p><p><br></p><p>What a fucking waste.</p><p><br></p><p>Had they been used on people, they could have boosted a normal Middle Class being to High Class with ease.</p><p><br></p><p>A million or even ten thousand High Class Beings….that’s a whole new ball game….</p><p><br></p><p>It could have been used as easy weapons for the entire army.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean Hades did create a hundred thousand Devils but had he used the Scale Mails with them, things would have been completely different….</p><p><br></p><p>But then again, that was a dumb novel and this is the real world.</p><p><br></p><p>Right now, my soldiers needed weapons.</p><p><br></p><p>Equiping such a large army needs a lot of money and we didn’t have that so we had started to work on this.</p><p><br></p><p>I already had enough DNA from the Ddraig and Albion to make the Scale Mails.</p><p><br></p><p>The next part was to remove the light and holy weakness from my soldiers.</p><p><br></p><p>But these projects were put on hold for now since Valerie wasn’t strong enough right now.</p><p><br></p><p>Today however, I hadn’t come here for Valerie but for someone else.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked towards the girl who was healing the tired and injured people in the distance.</p><p><br></p><p>Asia Argento.</p><p><br></p><p>This girl, she had been in the background of the group the entire time because she wasn’t exactly a combatant.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, her personality made her detest any form of combat.</p><p><br></p><p>That was not to say that she was weak. In terms of just Magical Power, she was rivalling an Ultimate Class being and with the Balance Breaker of her Twilight Healing which had been changed to a Subspecies due to the influence of the Essences, she could heal entire armies all at once.</p><p><br></p><p>I had often thought that Asia’s kindness was kinda exaggerated in the story but after knowing her for so long, I found out <a href=\"https://that….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">that….it</a> was actually severely understated.</p><p><br></p><p>This girl didn’t have a single evil bone in her body.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact she always tries to look for good in things and people and blames herself in case things go bad, even if it’s not her fault.</p><p><br></p><p>And I….hated that last part.</p><p><br></p><p>Those pieces of crap from the Church had really done a number on her mind so much so that even when she was thrown away by them as a tradable object, she never once complained.</p><p><br></p><p>The worst part was that since the reveal about my identity and that Asia Argento was actually serving me….the Church had declared her a witch.</p><p><br></p><p>….the fucking audacity of those bastards.</p><p><br></p><p>They couldn’t do anything against me because of my power and Michael’s grasp on their leash so they were slandering my subordinates and spreading hate against them.</p><p><br></p><p>And for just this fact, I am going to make them kneel in front of her.</p><p><br></p><p>I had promised to give the girl a home where she would be treated with respect and I am not going to let some random self-righteous pieces of crap just shit on my word.</p><p><br></p><p>As for the girl herself, she got along well with everyone in my group and was liked by others too and while she pretended not to care about what the church were saying about her, I as well as several others here, can sense emotions and she is actually hurt by their comments.</p><p><br></p><p>Not that she ever complained to me.</p><p><br></p><p>Her relationship with <a href=\"https://me….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">me….it</a> was quite complicated.</p><p><br></p><p>“Lord Damien.” The girl looked at me as I was approaching and quickly got up from her seat and came in front of me with excitement and kneeled with her hands clasped in prayer.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Since the time she had seen me changing into my Archangel form, she had behaved like this.</p><p><br></p><p>She treats me like a real angel….someone chosen by God….</p><p><br></p><p>She even waved off me being a reincarnation of Lucifer by saying that since I could change into an Archangel, it meant that God forgave me and had accepted me back.</p><p><br></p><p>Now I know that was the case with Lucifer….but….I had only found it recently in my dreams, whereas Asia believed this to be the case since the first time she saw me transforming.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously….faith is a scary thing.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the girl once more and sighed. “How many times have I told you not to kneel in front of me? Get up.” I ordered.</p><p><br></p><p>She got up, looking a bit down so I caressed her head.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tomorrow, there is going to be a meeting between the Three Factions and I want you to accompany me there.”</p><p><br></p><p>“M-me?’</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I have a surprise for everyone.” I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>And what a surprise it was going to be.</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I walked back towards my room to rest for the day and saw Gretel standing in front of the room, waiting for me.</p><p><br></p><p>She opened the door and both of us entered to see a familiar sight in front of our eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“She was training all day today and must have fallen asleep.” Gretel said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. She has been on edge since we are getting closer to our first clash with the Wizards of Oz and trains most of the day. It’s not good for her mental state.”</p><p><br></p><p>“....I will see that she gets some rest after tomorrow.” Gretel replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“Actually, we should do something to make her release all the frustration that she has been holding back.”</p><p><br></p><p>While Lavinia knew about the situation with Glenda and how she had disappeared under the ruse of dying at the hands of Augusta to get rid of <a href=\"https://her….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">her….it</a> was still hard for her. After all, for Lavinia, that woman was the one who raised her for several years, especially when she had been in such a delicate period of time.</p><p><br></p><p>There was some emotional connection from her part, no matter how less.</p><p><br></p><p>That was not to say that she would betray us or even refuse any of my orders, her loyalty firmly lay with us, she would still be….sad.</p><p><br></p><p>I caressed the hair of the sleeping girl and laid on the bed myself, Gretel soon taking my side.</p><p><br></p><p>She hugged me from the side and I looked at her questioningly.</p><p>‘</p><p>It had been a while since we had spent some alone time with each other so I suddenly had an idea and my lips curled up in a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>Turning towards her I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Master?”</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t give her the chance to speak any more words as I pulled her in for a kiss.</p><p><br></p><p>She was a bit taken aback by the sudden action but quickly hugged me and returned the kiss.</p><p><br></p><p>By now, even she had gotten used to doing it with Lavinia sleeping beside us.</p><p><br></p><p>And the fact that Lavinia herself was extremely obvious with what she wants, I was fine with it too. All we needed was for Gretel to get comfortable and looking at her, slowly taking off her clothes without any kind of covers made me think that she was more than ready.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, she had had a talk with Lavinia and the girl didn’t stop intruding into our room so Lavinia had given her acquiescence. </p><p><br></p><p>She began grinding herself on me, making me hard in a moment. I didn’t remain idle as I grabbed her breasts and pinched her nipples, making her moan before she leaned in and kissed me.</p><p><br></p><p>My hands dropped to her hips and raised her slowly and she positioned me at the entrance of her cave as I pushed, my entire length entering into her at once.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mmmmmh.” She bit her lips to contain her moan but without much effect.</p><p><br></p><p>She moved and I looked up at her.</p><p><br></p><p>Silver hair flying around as her red eyes shined in the slight moonlight coming through the window. Her skin lighting up from the moonlight seemed to glow in an ethereal light.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, my Gretel was enchanting.</p><p><br></p><p>The way her eyes were half closed or the way she bit her lips. Her bouncing breasts or the sound of her moans, everything she did just made me more enchanted with her.</p><p><br></p><p>I took a hold of her hips and began thrusting from below as well, slowly increasing my pace as the room was filled with the sounds of clapping flesh.</p><p><br></p><p>One of my hands slipped and rubbed her little nub with a bit of my Passion Magic, making her moans even louder as she increased the pace of moving.</p><p><br></p><p>Asmodeus Clan Trait was very useful for this.</p><p><br></p><p>With a grunt I thrust once more, releasing my seed deep into her.</p><p><br></p><p>She too shivered at the same time and collapsed on top of me but this was far from enough for me.</p><p><br></p><p>While Asmodeus’ Clan Trait was useful, this blood had a flaw as well….I was almost insatiable once I started having sex. Thus I pushed her on her back, capturing her lips before she could voice her surprise and started thrusting into the still climaxing Gretel.</p><p><br></p><p>“Aaaaahhhh.” She moaned but it was muffled by my kiss. Her hands clawed my back and then grabbed my hair as she pulled me to deepen the kiss while both her legs wrapped around my waist tightly.</p><p><br></p><p>I hadn’t realised it but I had a lot of stress piling up and she had been working very hard too so this was a very good opportunity for us to release some steam.</p><p><br></p><p>Soon enough, I released my second load inside her and continued.</p><p><br></p><p>We had completely forgotten about our fellow companion as we indulged ourselves.</p><p><br></p><p>After letting out my fifth load inside her, I pulled out as my semen poured out of her.</p><p><br></p><p>Both of us were covered with sweat and I picked her up and made her lay on my chest as I lay down again.</p><p><br></p><p>It was at this time that I noticed something different.</p><p><br></p><p>The even breathing beside us had changed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Lavy.” I called out making Gretel look my direction and then as if realising something, in Lavinia’s direction. As for the girl herself, she shuddered lightly.</p><p><br></p><p>I placed a hand on her head and caressed her hair lightly and she turned towards us.</p><p><br></p><p>She was blushing madly to the extent that even her ears were red.</p><p><br></p><p>“I….” She whispered.</p><p><br></p><p>“I know what you want, Lavy.” I said when she didn’t speak further.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked up at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“I mean your intentions were a bit obvious.” I shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>Her mouth opened slightly at my words then a sad look came upon her face.</p><p><br></p><p>Ah….she was thinking that I was rejecting her so I pulled her to my side, surprising her.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am not rejecting your advances. In fact, I would be lying if I said that after all these years together, I didn’t feel anything towards you. Trust me, if that were the case, you wouldn’t be sleeping beside me.” I clarified before she had those kinds of thoughts any further.</p><p><br></p><p>“The only reason I didn’t respond earlier was because I wanted to give us some time so that you can have a chance in case you had any second thoughts.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I wouldn’t….” She began speaking but I put a finger on her lips.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I found that out soon too. That brings me to the second reason. I had just accepted Gretel’s feelings and I wanted to give our relationship some time before bringing someone else into it or it wouldn’t have been fair to any one of you.”</p><p><br></p><p>She calmed down on hearing my reason.</p><p><br></p><p>“But I guess I have been a bit too slow this time and ended up worrying you instead. So let me make up for it. ”I looked at Gretel and she nodded at me. Then I turned towards her. “My current state might not be the perfect one for such things so I apologise for that.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Lavinia Reni….would you go out with me?”</p><p><br></p><p>The girl just stared at me and the moment lasted a bit too long to make it awkward but just as I was going to say something she leaned in and kissed me directly on my lips. I looked at her and then responded accordingly.</p><p><br></p><p>She was clearly inexperienced but was trying to make up for it with her enthusiasm. I caressed her back, letting her take her time as my hand slid inside her shirt.</p><p><br></p><p>She always just wore one of my shirts or oversized T Shirts when sleeping with nothing inside.</p><p><br></p><p>It was somehow even more seductive than being naked.</p><p><br></p><p>My hand crept from her back to her ass as I lifted her and pulled her on top of me. She was hugging my neck, never breaking the kiss while I did so.</p><p><br></p><p>She finally pulled back after a full minute and her eyes looked hazy.</p><p><br></p><p>“That was a great way to answer. Let me return the favour.” I got up and pushed her on her back, getting on top of her. “Help me, Gretel.”</p><p><br></p><p>““Eh?!””</p><p><br></p><p>Both the girls were surprised at my words but my cute maid understood me in a look and a rare smile crept on her lips.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Master. I need to welcome the newest addition to our family too.” She smirked, something even I had only seen a few times and crept on Laviinia’s side, taking one of her breasts in her hands and massaging it.</p><p><br></p><p>“Gre-chan! Mmmhh.”</p><p><br></p><p>I, in the meanwhile, claimed her lips again and worked on her other breast.</p><p><br></p><p>Gretel wasn’t far behind and began showering kisses on her breast, slowly circling her nipple but never getting there, making Lavy moan in my mouth from all the stimulation.</p><p><br></p><p>Due to our position, my length was rudding directly on her slit. She was wet and I moved at a slow speed, slowly increasing my speed to tease her even more.</p><p><br></p><p>Pulling back, I saw her, drool slightly flowing from the side of her face as she was trying hard to control her moans.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let them out, Lavy. I like your cute voice. I want to hear it more.”</p><p><br></p><p>“N-nooo ahhhh. I….I’m embarrassed.” She answered, earning her a bite on her nipple from my maid.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why are you embarrassed, Lavy? You are cute. That’s something we all knew. I want to see more of it.” I smiled, pinching her nipple while my other hand went down and brushed her clit, making her jerk from the stimulation.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mhhhh.” She shook her head and by the seven heavens, she looked so fucking adorable.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t think she was even aware of how mind numbingly arousing her actions were.</p><p><br></p><p>It just made me want to tease her even more.</p><p><br></p><p>I once again reaffirmed that I am a sadist and found out a new fact that….just like Gretel, Lavinia is also a bit of a masochist.</p><p><br></p><p>And I was going to explore this side of her to the fullest.</p><p><br></p><p>I lifted her by her thighs so that my face was directly in front of her pussy and she could see both her core and me directly, and placed a kiss on it while staring into her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Noooo stoppp it.” She covered her face but the third person in the room wouldn’t allow it.</p><p><br></p><p>My maid knew me and my intentions very well and she would never allow my fun to be interrupted.</p><p><br></p><p>She caught Lavinia’s hand and held them above her head, preventing her from hiding her face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah Gre-chan….”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s not good. You shouldn’t hide yourself like that, Lavy. Master is right. You do look adorable when you are flustered like this. I never knew you could show such expressions.” She said in a stoic tone but the light smirk on the corner of her lips was telling a different story altogether.</p><p><br></p><p>Was she awakening to something new?</p><p><br></p><p>I would have smirked if I wasn’t busy tasting the tasty feast in front of me. I lapped at the increasingly wet slit of my newest lover while Gretel focused on her nipples.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mmphhh ahhhh d-dont….aahhh.” Lavinia moaned but she was given no respite.</p><p><br></p><p>My lips caught on to her little nub and sucked them with force while Gretel took the same time to bite her nipple, making the poor blonde scream as her entire body shivered hard.</p><p><br></p><p>She came.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked up from her core to the piece of art we had created.</p><p><br></p><p>Lavy had half closed eyes and her innocent appearance was completely replaced with mind numbing sexiness.</p><p><br></p><p>I was hard as a rock all over again.</p><p><br></p><p>My maid noticed this and took action.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let me Master.”</p><p><br></p><p>She said as she took a hold of my length and slowly rubbed it up and down before taking it in her mouth, making me moan.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t stand by either. I dove into Lavinia’s pussy again, this time, one of my fingers finding her hole and loosening her up lightly.</p><p><br></p><p>Her moans increased as Gretel worked on me.</p><p><br></p><p>A minute or two later she moved back and I took a position between Lavy’s legs while Gretel went to her head and placed Lavy’s head on her lap, giving her a lap pillow, her breasts hanging right above the blonde’s head.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at both my lovers and took a moment to appreciate the sight.</p><p><br></p><p>Lavy too realised  my gaze and nodded her head shyly.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t make her wait for long, positioning myself at the entrance of her smouldering cave, I pushed slowly at first, entering her inch by inch.</p><p><br></p><p>She tightly held Gretel’s hand as I entered her, her entire body gripping me like a wet vice. A few seconds later, I made the final push as I felt myself enter her fully.</p><p><br></p><p>“Agghhh.” Her moan resounded throughout the room as her body arched.</p><p><br></p><p>I used a bit of Passion Magic to prevent her from feeling any pain, changing it all into pleasure.</p><p><br></p><p>I took a hold of her waist and pulled back slightly and pushed again, the incredible resistance of her core making me humm in satisfaction.</p><p><br></p><p>Slowly, I increased my speed as she was getting used to it too, her waist shook in response to my movements.</p><p><br></p><p>A few minutes later, I was thrusting in and she was matching my thrusts as her legs wrapped around my waist. She was even responding to Gretel as she took on of my cure maid’s nipples in her mouth, making her yelp in surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>My hand found her breasts and massaged them while my other hand made sure that my maid wasn’t feeling ignored.</p><p><br></p><p>I pulled Gretel in for a kiss which she returned happily.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next few minutes the room was filled with the sounds of flesh slapping and moans.</p><p><br></p><p>I felt myself approacing my peak and began thrusting harder, making her let go of Gretel as her moans grew louder.</p><p><br></p><p>With my peak, my Passion Magic flared as Lavinia experienced her climax as well, her entire body jerking wildly as she squirted hard.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t pull back as I ejaculated ropes of my sperm as deep inside her as I couldwith each thrust.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Wow.”</p><p><br></p><p>The one who said it was not me….nor Lavy, who looked like she had fainted. And I had to agree.</p><p><br></p><p>The result of our incessant teasing could indeed be described with this word alone.</p><p><br></p><p>I let myself fall beside her body as Gretel slowly slipped beside me, into my arms.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the unconscious girl and smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>At least her first time would be memorable….after all, how man girls could say they lost their virginity in a threesome and fainted at that.</p><p><br></p><p>I placed a small kiss on both my lover’s heads as both Gretel and I looked at Lavinia who was sleeping peacefully.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly Gretel let out a giggle.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Kuroka is going to be so mad when she finds out.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“She would, wouldn’t she?” I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>As a fact she was….after all, she was a Satan Class being who fainted from excess pleasure.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe I overdid it with the Passion Magic.</p><p><br></p><p>She woke up after half an hour and cuddled into my side and I caressed her hair.</p><p><br></p><p>“Welcome to the family, Lavy.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Mmh.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at her and spoke. “I might not be the best person in the world. In fact, I have a lot of flaws. I might have more women in my life too, but I promise you….that I will never  betray you or let you go….even if you want me to. I am very possessive like that.”</p><p><br></p><p>She just rubbed her face on my chest, making herself more comfortable.</p><p><br></p><p>After resting for a while, she opened up too.</p><p><br></p><p>She was having different thoughts about facing her previous Mentor if we were to fight against the Wizards of Oz.</p><p><br></p><p>“She might have just kept me to study my Sacred Gear but….she did save my life when I was at the lowest point of my life. Moreover, she didn’t treat me badly either. And she might have created a lie to make me leave but….she could have done so. After all, she didn’t owe me anything. So….”</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t want to fight her or kill her.” I completed and she became silent.</p><p><br></p><p>She had matured a lot compared to how she was when we had first met.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm….that’s quite understandable. I am actually proud of you for thinking that.” I caressed her hair and she felt her release the breath she was holding.</p><p><br></p><p>“If you don’t want to fight her….don’t. I give you my word that as long as she doesn’t attack us or harm our people, I will not give any orders to kill her.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But….” I continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“In return, you must promise me that….if she….or any of the Wizards of the Oz, attack or plan to harm us….”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will not hold back either.” She completed my words with an uncharacteristically serious tone. “This place is my home….and I will not let anyone destroy it….Not even Glenda.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at her for a moment and nodded. “That’s my girl.”</p><p><br></p><p>We enjoyed each other’s company till all of us drifted off to sleep.</p><p><br></p><p>Tomorrow was a big day and I needed to prepare for it.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Sirzechs -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Are you ready?” He asked Serafall and Ajuka as they teleported to the Gremory Mansion followed by Behemoth.</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“In that case, let’s leave.” He got up as well and Grayfia followed him.</p><p><br></p><p>This meeting was something they had been waiting for since Merlin’s eerie warning.</p><p><br></p><p>For the last two weeks, Ajuka had been spending all his time to find out any information about the Melbranche and the secret of the Evil Pieces. It did lead to some discoveries.</p><p><br></p><p>They discovered a place under the city of Lucifad where something had been sealed till a while ago.</p><p><br></p><p>Twelve things to be exact and then they were moved from there. The move took place around four hundred years or so ago when the Civil War was going on.</p><p><br></p><p>Were those things released during the Civil War? If so then why weren’t they used?</p><p><br></p><p>He couldn’t even imagine what would have happened if they had joined the fight.</p><p><br></p><p>They had been trying tirelessly to figure out a way to counter them since they had heard of it and all four of them were exhausted.</p><p><br></p><p>And this was not even mentioning the bomb about the afterlife of Devils Cleria had thrown.</p><p><br></p><p>There were too many questions and the only chance for an answer was this meeting.</p><p><br></p><p>Things were turning out to be too troublesome.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked back at his family and saw his mother joining both her hands in prayer and let out a sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>She had been doing the same for a while now and claims that she even had a response to her prayers.</p><p><br></p><p>Ajuka tested her to see if there was something wrong with her but found nothing wrong with her. That said, her Demonic Power was slowly increasing and she was gaining powers very similar to Rias.</p><p><br></p><p>Was it?</p><p><br></p><p>Sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>The main thing was that several others of the servants in the house had started doing the same after seeing her.</p><p><br></p><p>He shook his head and looked at Grayfia and nodded and she activated the Teleportation magic.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Michael -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Is this the place?” Uriel asked him as they teleported to Damien’s appointed location.</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded and sure enough, he felt few people approaching the place.</p><p><br></p><p>They revealed themselves and he heard Uriel take a deep breath.</p><p><br></p><p>“Celine.” He called.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl nodded but not before taking an extra moment to stare back at her father and his brother.</p><p><br></p><p>“The meeting will be in a different location. We have received the news of people planning to attack the conference and we are going to lay a trap for them there.</p><p><br></p><p>“What! Who is planning attacks?” He asked surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>“A few groups. We will see who attacks when they do.” She said and teleported them from there.</p><p><br></p><p>As he arrived at the place, he recalled the number of people dissatisfied with Helel’s return as well as the changes in the management of Heaven. It was mainly the group who fell as he resolved the loopholes of Heaven's system. It had taken them a considerable amount of effort to resolve that matter as the number was a lot more than he was expecting.</p><p><br></p><p>The second was a group of people from the church who were dissatisfied with his handling of the matter.</p><p><br></p><p>It took him personally coming down to the Vatican to silence the group but even that felt like a temporary relief.</p><p><br></p><p>There was bound to be a fight because of the thousands of years of grudges between the three sides.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe the only one who could stop such a thing and resolve this matter peacefully was….</p><p><br></p><p>He let out a sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>A voice from Celine stopped his thoughts and they saw that they had reached the place.</p><p><br></p><p>Merlin stood at the door to receive them.</p><p><br></p><p>He couldn’t sense anything inside the building.</p><p><br></p><p>Merlin as if sensing his thoughts explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“The place inside is a completely different dimension.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ah….that explains it.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are the first group to arrive so we have a bit of time on our hands.” Merlin informed as he led them inside.</p><p><br></p><p>The shop was still the same but this time there is barely any people inside but every one inside was someone with great strength.</p><p><br></p><p>He quickly took a look around and there were around twenty people, all High Ultimate Class or higher. This kind of strength….along with the ones he had shown during the ruckus in the Underworld….was at a level of an independent faction already.</p><p><br></p><p>And there were not only devils but also people from other races….all of them together in harmony.</p><p><br></p><p>Damien managed to gather this without anyone even being aware of it.</p><p><br></p><p>Sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe she was actually right….Helel is a King and Michael is a General.</p><p><br></p><p>They followed Merlin inside and inside a private room, and there he was, sitting with his maid and the Child of Light, Sean Collins, behind him. The most surprising was probably the last member of the group.</p><p><br></p><p>Asia Argento.</p><p><br></p><p>Merlin too walked and joined them behind him while Celine stayed by the door.</p><p><br></p><p>He felt Uriel halt his steps slightly and looked at his brother’s stunned face.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>It was one thing to hear and see someone on a screen and something else entirely to see them face to face.</p><p><br></p><p>Damien noticed Uriel’s hesitation and sent a smile his way as he spoke. “So….what would you like to have? Tea, coffee….holy water or would you like me to turn water into wine? I must say that’s a convenient skill to have.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>He stared blankly at his twin. “Really….that joke again?”</p><p><br></p><p>He just laughed. “It worked, didn’t it?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sigh.” he let out an audible sigh as he sat down. The crude attempt of humour did lighten the atmosphere for them too as Uriel looked calmed down and took a seat beside him.</p><p><br></p><p>Damien glanced at Uriel and saw his eyes moving towards the boy behind him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sean….give him the spear.”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy nodded and in the next second, the room was filled with the Holy Aura from the True Longinus.</p><p><br></p><p>Uriel held the spear in his hand and bowed to it for a moment before opening his eyes and returning the spear back to Sean. “Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>The atmosphere became sombre after this.</p><p><br></p><p>At this moment, Damien looked as if he felt something. “Great. Our guests are here too. Let’s get on with it.”</p><p><br></p><p>Five minutes or so later, they found themselves sitting on the top floor of the building with Sirzechs, Serafall, Azazel and Shemhazai sitting in front of them. </p><p><br></p><p>The view outside was clear for them to see.</p><p><br></p><p>It took him a moment to realise that this dimension was created using the Dimension Lost which they had found to be in the possession of Gretel Lucifuge.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are there really people who are going to attack this meeting?” Sirzechs asked, looking outside.</p><p><br></p><p>Damien shrugged. “What can I say….people are jealous of me.”</p><p><br></p><p>Michael wasn’t the only one rolling his eyes at this.</p><p><br></p><p>Some things never change.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s think about those later. I am sure that since you have decided to go on with this meeting, it means that you have already arranged more than enough protection details for everyone. What I am more interested in is just what kind of world ending threat it is that you wanted to talk about.” Azazel brought up the matter everyone wanted to talk about.</p><p><br></p><p>Damien looked at all of them and his eyes stopped at him. “Let’s begin this from a history lesson, shall we?”</p><p><br></p><p>Michael suddenly had a very bad feeling.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Damien -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Ah….Michael guessed it already.</p><p><br></p><p>Did he awaken some kind of mind reading power?</p><p><br></p><p>Well, not my problem.</p><p><br></p><p>“As I am sure many know about my previous life’s adventures. Establishing a new race in the Underworld and all….but I doubt rarely anyone knows why I did it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Wasn’t it because Father never went there? Heaven had its own afterlife for the dead and that place was inhabited by Pits and Demonic Beings, things Father was allergic to.” Azazel replied nonchalantly, making Uriel glare at the man for the last part.</p><p><br></p><p>“On the matter of the dead, I also have a question.” Sirzechs asked, diverting the attention of everyone in the room.</p><p><br></p><p>I raised an eyebrow and he continued. “Is it true that Devil and Fallen Angel souls can also go to Heaven’s afterlife?” he asked directly, looking at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“What nonsense? As if he would ever tolerate such a thing. The Heaven’s system would be blaring alarms as soon as a Demonic Being or corrupted individual like us enters. For them to live there….even the thought of it is stupid.” Azazel waved it off.</p><p><br></p><p>Uriel and Shemhazai, while likely saying the same words as Azazel, had expressions which said the same.</p><p><br></p><p>Michael on the other hand was….looking at me….unsure.</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded. “They can.”</p><p><br></p><p>The reply had different reactions from everyone. Azazel looked back at me, taken aback, Shemhazai looked at me oddly too while Michael….he just had a sad look on his face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nonsense.” Uriel, the last one. as expected, burst out in anger.</p><p><br></p><p>“Shush….just because something doesn’t match your belief doesn’t mean it’s untrue, brother. To explain with an example, just because a colour blind person can only see black and white shades for their entire life doesn’t mean the other colours don’t exist or are you claiming to know of all of the billions of souls in the Third Heaven?” I questioned making him shut down his response.</p><p><br></p><p>But he didn’t give up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Father would never let the Demonic or Corrupted, enter Heaven.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Tch tch tch.” I shook my finger. “Not quite true, brother. Father never treated someone badly due to their demonic nature….what he hated were their deeds. As for letting someone with Demonic nature live in Heaven he would….and he has already….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Helel!” Michael spoke in a warning tone, eliciting a surprised look from everyone at the normally calm and peaceful Archangel using that kind of voice.</p><p><br></p><p>“What brother? Did I say something wrong?”</p><p><br></p><p>He just stared at me, a dead serious look in his eyes without speaking any words.</p><p><br></p><p>“The truth always comes out at one point, brother. Father has taught this too. I think it’s about time.”</p><p><br></p><p>However Michael, as stubborn as ever, didn’t agree. “If you break your word, I will kill you.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now that….made all the leaders in the room stare at Michael in shock. Even Uriel was looking at him as if he was someone else.</p><p><br></p><p>“I never break my word, brother. You of all people should know about that. If I did….the result of the Great War would have been far different than what it was.” I said in an equally serious tone.</p><p><br></p><p>And it was true.</p><p><br></p><p>If Lucifer had indeed revealed the news about his mother during the Great War, a great number of Angels would have rebelled and the Fallen Angels might have sided with him too….but he didn’t….just because he had given a word to his Father, an oath that they would never speak about their Mother with others….ever again.</p><p><br></p><p>God knew that information about her would lead to a division between his children so he erased all traces of her.</p><p><br></p><p>The other Archangels except Michael and Helel were infants….and didn’t remember anything when she was sealed.</p><p><br></p><p>Seraphs and younger Angels were not born from them but rather created by God using their powers.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, only Michael and Helel were actually born from their mother. Others were all created with their power.</p><p><br></p><p>The reason why the Archangels were so much stronger than other ones was because they were created by both their parents while the rest were just created by God alone, using the power of his wife.</p><p><br></p><p>She did love all her children regardless but Helel was getting increasingly frustrated with his mother’s imprisonment and finally left after not being able to convince his father otherwise.</p><p><br></p><p>“I did promise that I wouldn’t speak a word about her….till I die. And guess what brother, I did die. Promise kept.”</p><p><br></p><p>Michael had a look of realisation on his face and just closed his eyes, facing towards the ground….not even facing us.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t need my Haki to feel the helplessness from the guy.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, he was carrying a lot of weight on his shoulders.</p><p><br></p><p>“Michael....today's discussion does involve….this information.” I tried to explain.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked up at me, his blank face returning again but didn’t say anything.</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay….just what are you two talking about? What promise? Who is this ‘she’ you both are talking about?” Azazel asked, having had enough of this.</p><p><br></p><p>I took a look at Michael and he didn’t say anything so I decided to go ahead with it and turned towards Azazel, asking him a question.</p><p><br></p><p>“How many parents does a child have, Azazel?”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Kokabiel -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He looked around himself at the forces which had gathered to attack the meeting of the Three Factions.</p><p><br></p><p>Over a Thousand Fallen Angels and humans lined up, each having their own agenda.</p><p><br></p><p>He hadn’t expected the plan to go so smoothly when he had thought of it but it seems as if the world was helping him too.</p><p><br></p><p>The sudden influx of Fallen Angels from Heaven who had been driven out when Michael somehow worked out the loopholes of the Heaven’s System had been more than eager to lend a hand with the promise that they would get a chance to get even with Michael.</p><p><br></p><p>Then there were the hundreds of Fallen Angels who were destroyed by Uriel during the Great War after the attack on his daughter.</p><p><br></p><p>While Uriel’s rage had scared away most of them, their anger had never subsided even in the past centuries.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, there were the ones from the Church.</p><p><br></p><p>These people hadn’t joined them but had organised a resistance of their own in an attempt to take down the Devil. Most of them consisted of people who had retired from work or left, especially those few monsters among the group.</p><p><br></p><p>He hadn’t sat idle either.</p><p><br></p><p>Surprisingly, he received help from someone he wasn’t expecting at all.</p><p><br></p><p>Satanael lent a hand in this attack and who was he to look the gift horse in the mouth.</p><p><br></p><p>A dozen or so Sacred Gear users, including Azazel’s secret weapon going berserk in the middle of the meeting would increase the probability of success of their attack by a large margin.</p><p><br></p><p>Not to mention the vials Satanael had given them and the person wearing the hood who gave him chills with the amount of fighting intent he was exuding.</p><p><br></p><p>Satanael had also sent a large group of magicians to help maintain the barriers.</p><p><br></p><p>He had no idea how he had obtained ‘Its’ help or what he intended to do with ‘It’ but he didn’t care.</p><p><br></p><p>As long as the danger to the Fallen Angels can be removed.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, the last group was not someone who had arrived at the final moment and this was what gave Kokabiel the confidence of finally being able to take them all down.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the blue haired God who was throwing around spells to lock the surrounding dimension and prevent their enemies from escaping as well as anyone from outside from assisting.</p><p><br></p><p>The mad Norse God had decided to lend his hand because he was annoyed by Odin’s increasing closeness with Lucifer and the alliance between them.</p><p><br></p><p>The insane God was crazy and wanted to bring Armageddon and while Kokabiel might not share his same feelings….there was no requirements for their thoughts to align to get his help.</p><p><br></p><p>After all, he might not admit to it but each and every leader inside was stronger than Kokabiel. He wanted to take them down but he wasn’t a fool to attempt to do that on his own and Loki was a massive help here, especially when his son and grandsons were included when fighting against such monsters.</p><p><br></p><p>The magicians threw around barriers </p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Satanael -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He stood in the place where he was called for the meeting.</p><p><br></p><p>Even now, he was wondering why that man would call him of all people, although he had an inkling, he could never be sure when that person was concerned.</p><p><br></p><p>Soon enough, a teleportation magic circle lit up the place and out of it came the man.</p><p><br></p><p>Silver hair, blue eyes and a goatee and dressed in black and silver.</p><p><br></p><p>Rizevim Livan Lucifer.</p><p><br></p><p>“Uyahahahaha hello there dear Uncle. How have you been? It’s been a long time since we saw each other. The last time was….well we tried to kill each other in the Great War, remember?”</p><p><br></p><p>Satanael just stared at the man without any expression and got directly to the topic.</p><p><br></p><p>“What do you need, Rizevim?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oya, directly getting to the topic, I see. No hi, no hello, no asking for my well being? But I guess I understand. You are on the run right now and must be very busy. Don’t worry, I bring good news.” he spread his arms.</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t reply and kept staring.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have heard that you have started a new organisation, Chaos Brigade? I was wondering if I could join in the fun? After all, you know, if there is something which I like, it’s causing some good ol’ chaos.” he rubbed his hands.</p><p><br></p><p>“We are not recruiting.” Satanael directly stopped him from speaking further.</p><p><br></p><p>In all these centuries, there was one thing he had known for a face….that nothing good comes from associating with this man.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh come on, don’t be a spoilsport! I will be a bad boy, I promise hahahaha. Get it? Bad boy since we are planning to cause a lot of chaos?”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t answer.</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing no reply come from him, Rizevim threw aside the joking tone.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tch, no fun. Then how about a deal? A deal of mutual benefit?” He offered and Satanael raised an eyebrow.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have heard that you wish to find a way to break the limiters of Supernatural races and even Sacred Gears to create more Longinus tier Sacred Gears?”</p><p><br></p><p>He paused for a second and didn’t deny.</p><p><br></p><p>Rizevim brought out a file from a magical space and threw it at him.</p><p><br></p><p>Malebranche.</p><p><br></p><p>The title on the file.</p><p><br></p><p>Satanael opened it and took a look at the contents.</p><p><br></p><p>Rizevim didn’t stay quiet and explained while he read the file.</p><p><br></p><p>“Dear Dad and his buddies were very wary of the trinkets created by Gramps before the Great War so they did some research of their own and the results of their hard work were these magnificent pieces of art, the Malebranche. Twelve sentient gears, similar to an autonomous type Sacred Gear with the power, each rivalling a Longinus.”</p><p><br></p><p>He read each page and the information matched with everything said by Rizevim.</p><p><br></p><p>“They could have destroyed their enemies if they had used it in the Great War and even had the chance to win the war but they….sigh….it’s embarrassing to say this but….they were afraid of using them. Afraid that they would lose control and destroy everything. Seriously, how did they even call themselves Satans and be afraid of their own tools? And thus, all these amazing items….could never see the light of the day and let the world see their glory. Unfortunate, right? They went so far to hide their existence that they had sealed them and not even I knew of it and only found out about it by chance recently and have been trying to work on them….with little success. And that’s when I heard about you.” He smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>Satanael looked up from the file, having finished looking at the entire thing and clenched his fist.</p><p><br></p><p>They….did they hold back during the Great War?</p><p><br></p><p>Could he access an even greater power?</p><p><br></p><p>Didn’t that mean that what he had been working to achieve all this time, was already achieved by him….a millenia ago?</p><p><br></p><p>Was he once again defeated by him?</p><p><br></p><p>Satanael gritted his teeth at the mere thought.</p><p><br></p><p>“What I offer is that I provide you with an access to these beauties and in return, I want you to find a way to control them. I would have preferred Azazel but he would never agree so I have to make do with the second best.” Rizevim shrugged, making him glare at the silver haired devil.</p><p><br></p><p>This bastard was provoking him to make use of him.</p><p><br></p><p>Satanael took a deep breath and calmed himself down.</p><p><br></p><p>After all, two people could play at this.</p><p><br></p><p>“You would know about second place, wouldn’t you? After all, you could never surpass him, despite being far stronger than him.” He quipped and felt a hint of pleasure when Rizevim’s face twisted  into a smile and a bit of his power was let loose.</p><p><br></p><p>“Uyahahahaha I take it back about you not being fun. You are probably my favourite Fallen Angel now. So….what do you say, can I join your boy scout group now?” Rizevim smiled, almost ferociously.</p><p><br></p><p>Satanael looked at the man and then at the file and clutched at it.</p><p><br></p><p>Lucifer might have started the research before him but even he couldn’t control these Malebranche so….he will do what even the Devil failed to do. He will completely make these Satanic Arms kneel before him. Since Rizevim wanted to make use of him….he should be prepared to be used by him too.</p><p><br></p><p>With this thought, he nodded in agreement at Rizevim.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha that’s the spirit. Our partnership is going to be gloriously evil. I can’t wait for it.”</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Man….I am tired.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Writing the last part while falling asleep on my keyboard.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>So, a lot of things happened in this chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Damien organising a meeting of the three Factions and as he knows about the attacks.

Both were quite proficient in Haki and could easily handle themselves using their physique only.</p><p><br></p><p>The fight ended with Shirone’s defeat as she huffed on the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>Vienna was relatively unhurt with just a few scratches here and there.</p><p><br></p><p>She had grown immensely since a few years ago.</p><p><br></p><p>When she gets into the Satan Class, I will teach her how to unlock the Juggernaut Drive and more of Albion’s power.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe a spar with her eternal rival would push her again.</p><p><br></p><p>It’s almost time to organise the fight.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked as both Shirone and Vienna were healed by Asia and Valerie.</p><p><br></p><p>These two didn’t like fighting too much but they were still doing their very best to help out in their own way.</p><p><br></p><p>I will have to arrange for a few things to make them stronger.</p><p><br></p><p>Just as I was thinking of these, I got a message.</p><p><br></p><p>“Master.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p><br></p><p>“There has been an attack on the Nura Clan.”</p><p><br></p><p>“….I see.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It was the Gokadoin clan. They were targeting Nurarihyon’s grandson, Rikuo Nura. They were repealed by Rikuo-kun and our people along with the Nura Clan have chased after them. We think it’s a trap.”</p><p><br></p><p>And you still chased after them?</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, with the strength of my people, it wouldn’t matter if it’s a trap or not.</p><p><br></p><p>“Send a few people as backup and increase the security around Shirone.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Master.”</p><p><br></p><p>With Hagoromo Gitsune there, things were more or less fine as long as she is not ambushed by several Gods there.</p><p><br></p><p>It was time I started making moves for the Underworld as well.</p><p><br></p><p>The control of the current Satans was slowly loosening over the Underworld as most of the people wanted me to govern them. The only reason they didn’t start a rebellion was because of my words of letting them keep their position. It still didn’t stop people from trying to search for me.</p><p><br></p><p>They knew that I had a large group of Devils under me and they wanted to join that group.</p><p><br></p><p>I had expected this too, and planned for my next move.</p><p><br></p><p>And now it was time to take the next step.</p><p><br></p><p>I sent a message to Cleria.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s time. You can return.”</p><p><br></p><p>There was a moment of silence on the other side and then a reply came.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Hagoromo Gitsune -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Sensei, this looks like a trap.” Rikuo said from her side as they chased after the enemies to see their location.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, you noticed that?” She answered, unconcerned.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at her surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are we still going to chase after them?” He asked, confused.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy was taken aback.</p><p><br></p><p>“If you have any doubts, you can ask me.” She replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“I….don’t understand.” He said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Those people….they are my descendants.” She revealed.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy shot a stunned look at her.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are not doubting me? I could be leading you into a trap.” She raised an eyebrow.</p><p><br></p><p>The child….rolled his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“With your strength, do you even need to take such a roundabout way? Moreover, if you just wanted to kill or capture us, why even save us in the first place.” He said, looking straight. “And….”</p><p><br></p><p>“And?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I trust you. I don’t think you will betray us.” He said, not faltering in the slightest.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ufufufufu you have become quite a charmer, Rikuo-kun.” She laughed and looked forward. “These kids have been led astray by some people for their own gains. I cannot, in my right conscience, see them die because of this. They are, after all my descendants. So, we are going to knock some sense into their heads. The rest of the children don’t have to fight. I have already contacted the Master and he is sending reinforcements. Take this as a test for a selected few. After all, they might be nothing for me but several of them are stronger than you. Let’s see how much you all have learned under my guidance.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So a test. I understand.”</p><p><br></p><p>Just as their conversation finished, the enemies they had been chasing stopped and turned back to look at them.</p><p><br></p><p>Her group stopped as well.</p><p><br></p><p>A barrier formed around the place, locking them in.</p><p><br></p><p>She instantly noticed the barrier.</p><p><br></p><p>A Heptagram Barrier designed by Seimei.</p><p><br></p><p>Looking at the intricacies of the barrier, she noticed that it hadn't changed much from the one she remembered.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously!</p><p><br></p><p>Did these kids not work to upgrade it in over a thousand years?</p><p><br></p><p>How disappointing.</p><p><br></p><p>She suddenly realised that her thought process had changed a lot in the past few years, since joining her new faction.</p><p><br></p><p>Surrounded by so many talented individuals, her sense of normality was a bit affected.</p><p><br></p><p>It’s not that they didn’t change the barrier much, they couldn’t.</p><p><br></p><p>It wasn’t that easy to improve Seimei’s life’s great work.</p><p><br></p><p>They were strong.</p><p><br></p><p>Four people among them were all at the Ultimate Class level which was quite good for any Youkai….or at least used to be before the rebirth of the Devil, her new Master.</p><p><br></p><p>It made her realise just how skewed the sense of power was among his faction.</p><p><br></p><p>These people standing in front of her were probably the previous leaders of the Gokadoin clan, and yet….they barely matched the kids from her new faction.</p><p><br></p><p>It was not the matter of them being disappointing but rather the people around her were just that outrageous.</p><p><br></p><p>“Rikuo, how many of them can you handle?” She pointed at the leaders of the other side.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy looked forward, drawing out his sword. “One should be easy. Two would be pushing it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm….you get three.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Wha….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t kill them.”</p><p><br></p><p>“....yes, sensei.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hagoromo Gitsune….I had heard that you were resurrected. To think you would fall so low as to join the side of these monsters.”</p><p><br></p><p>She narrowed her eyes and then she shrugged. “I am a youkai after all. It would be odd if I was siding with others. The real surprise is you, the ones who carry my blood and yet go against the Youkai. Just what exactly is your goal in attacking these children?”</p><p><br></p><p>“We are the descendants of Abe no Seimei, the greatest Onmyoji of all time. It is our life’s goal to purify the Youkai and walk in the footsteps of our ancestor.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?” She snorted and then looked towards the corner of the field in an empty space. “Just what language are these foolish children speaking?” </p><p><br></p><p>The space trembled and soon an illusion dispersed, and there stood that annoying fool, Nurarihyon. </p><p><br></p><p>Beside him stood a young girl who had a Shikigami summoned, someone whom she identified in one glance.</p><p><br></p><p>Hidemoto Keikain.</p><p><br></p><p>It was the famous Shikigami Technique of the Keikain….the Hagun. A technique to summon their ancestors.</p><p><br></p><p>The annoying onmyoji had used it against her when she had fought him and Nurarihyon.</p><p><br></p><p>The fool shrugged. “They think that Seimei wished to purify all youkai and my words were considered lies.”</p><p><br></p><p>She turned towards them with an incredulous look. “Seimei wished to create a world where humans and youkai lived together in peace due to his father who was an onmyoji and me who was a youkai, raising him. He only changed that view when I was killed by humans who wished to consume my heart in hopes of gaining immortality. Since then, he had changed his view to the youkai ruling this country. I can understand if you had any of these two goals to respect Seimei….but where does this nonsensical third thought come from?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do not try to shake us with your lies. Our ancestor overcame his blood and became revered as the strongest Onmyoji. We, just like him, will not fall to your words. It was a shame that we didn’t know about his exact reincarnation plans or we might have assisted him and then he might not have fallen to whatever tricks you people used.” One of the people, a black haired boy, said aggressively. “We are not as weak as Abe no Yasuna.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Nurarihyon -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“That boy is going to die.” He whispered to the spirit of Hidemoto as he sensed the surge in Hagoromo Gitsune’s power..</p><p><br></p><p>“Seriously, just what kind of weed do these people smoke nowadays. There are easier ways to die than that.”</p><p><br></p><p>They heard her speak.</p><p><br></p><p>“Rikuo, leave that one to me. You children can play with others.” As she spoke, her aura hadn’t stopped increasing for even a moment.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oi oi, is she for real? How did she get that strong?” Hidemoto pointed towards her, looking at the still rising power in disbelief.</p><p><br></p><p>He himself was no better. She was dozens of times stronger than before. If she had been even half of this when they had fought against each other all those years ago, he would have been chopped off into pieces before he could even unsheathe his blade.</p><p><br></p><p>“She got a master.”</p><p><br></p><p>Hidemoto’s head snapped as he looked at her in surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>“A master?” He pointed a finger at Hagoromo Gitsune. “Her? Is she the same youkai we know? Hagoromo Gitsune? Just who could tame that mad fox?” he asked, curiously.</p><p><br></p><p>“The Devil.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Devils? I don’t know much about them apart from the fact that they were having their grand threeway battle royale all over the world. How did she join the Devils?”</p><p><br></p><p>“She didn’t join the Devils. She was subdued by the creator of the Devils. Things happened. It’s a long story. Long story short, that guy is currently allied with us and has given us two sages. He….convinced her to work for him.”</p><p><br></p><p>Hidemoto looked stunned at the words.</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t blame the man.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole situation sounded so strange when listening to it.</p><p><br></p><p>One needed to live through it to understand what was going on.</p><p><br></p><p>“Anyways, I will explain everything to you later.” he said as he continued to look towards the children who were facing their opponents from the other side.</p><p><br></p><p>Rikko took the lead, his fear wrapping around his sword as he used Tsurara’s fear to wrap around him, using the Matoi technique.</p><p><br></p><p>He clashed evenly with one of the leaders of the Gokadoin house, Abe no Ariyuki.</p><p><br></p><p>“How interesting. This is the first time I have seen someone use their fear in such a way.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It is a technique created by my son, Rihan called the Matoi technique. A technique which only those with part human and part youkai heritage can use. In a way, by allowing another youkai to possess their human side, he can gain their power and increase his own powers exponentially.”</p><p><br></p><p>The two sides clashed against each other.</p><p><br></p><p>Abe no Ariyuki was a master of onmyojutsu and could use the Heptagram technique to both attack and defend himself, easily keeping up with Rikuo’s boosted attacks.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, it showed the growth of his grandson under the tutelage of Hagoromo Gitsune that he was keeping up with such a master.</p><p><br></p><p>Just at that moment, Ariyuki used one of his signature techniques.</p><p><br></p><p>“Careful.” Hidemoto was about to intervene but he stopped him.</p><p><br></p><p>The man looked at him in shock but he shook his head.</p><p><br></p><p>Ariyuki’s signature technique involved him dragging his opponent into a mirrored world</p><p><br></p><p>It was a high level barrier type technique.</p><p><br></p><p>A barrier type technique.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why Nurarihyon didn’t intervene.</p><p><br></p><p>They watched as both of them were covered into a barrier, trapping the two in a mirrored world.</p><p><br></p><p>Yura, the girl who was summoning Hidemoto, looked worried. She was Rikuo’s classmate and friend.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry. Rikuo will be alright.” he reassured.</p><p><br></p><p>“How would he be alright? That kind of technique, even I would be having trouble against it.” Hidemoto complained loudly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Keep looking. Rikuo hadn’t been learning just Fear under Hagoromo Gitsune.”</p><p><br></p><p>He was quite surprised when he heard that they were teaching him a completely new branch of magic and not even Haki which Akira had told them about.</p><p><br></p><p>Jujutsu Techniques as they called them.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a variation of the fear techniques. While normally, they were not that different from each other, even having a lot of similarities, the differences appeared when they were used at higher levels.</p><p><br></p><p>The barrier techniques, especially the Domain techniques.</p><p><br></p><p>Sure enough, a flash of white appeared from inside the barrier and the area around it was completely frozen.</p><p><br></p><p>Abe no Ariyuki was shot out from the barrier with a slash on his chest and crashed on the wall of the barrier.</p><p><br></p><p>The mist cleared and Rikuo was seen in a sword draw stance.</p><p><br></p><p>“One down. Two more to go.” He stood back up slowly.</p><p><br></p><p>The blast had attracted the eyes of every person in the place as they looked at the now unconscious Ariyuki and a victorious looking Rikuo standing there.</p><p><br></p><p>“But how?” Even Hidemoto looked confused.</p><p><br></p><p>He knew the feeling.</p><p><br></p><p>After all, he had been on the other side of such an attack too. Although, back then Rikuo was not using the Matoi, he had still been able to catch him off guard.</p><p><br></p><p>In the several rematches later on, Nurarihyon had not once been able to break through that technique of his directly. But the greatest boon of the technique was that all of Rikuo’s attacks became undodgeable.</p><p><br></p><p>A barrier infused with the fear technique of the Youkai.</p><p><br></p><p>It was unbelievable.</p><p><br></p><p>It was frightening.</p><p><br></p><p>Although, it was not even near when used in conjugation with the Matoi technique.</p><p><br></p><p>The Matoi technique as explained by Rihan, was in essence, letting a Youkai possess the human side of them. It meant that there were two different youkai in one body. The user thus possessed two completely different Fear techniques.</p><p><br></p><p>This technique covered for and even removed the several drawbacks of the Domain Expansion techniques as the cost of using the technique could easily be shouldered by the possessing Youkai and Rikuo can easily use another expansion after letting another youkai possess him….without using even an ounce of his own fear.</p><p><br></p><p>It also removed the effect of him not being able to use his fear technique right after the expansion ended.</p><p><br></p><p>It was as if someone had handmade this technique for a youkai hybrid.</p><p><br></p><p>This, according to Hagoromo Gitsune, was proof that humans and Youkai could not only peacefully exist together, they can also grow stronger than their current self.</p><p><br></p><p>And to be honest, Nurarihyon found this explanation of hers quite interesting himself.</p><p><br></p><p>Just as they were about to continue, he heard a voice from behind him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Greetings, Nurarihyon-sama.”</p><p><br></p><p>He turned back to see a boy with nine fox tails standing behind him.</p><p><br></p><p>Akira.</p><p><br></p><p>A smile formed at the corner of his lips.</p><p><br></p><p>He hadn’t sensed him at all, not until he had spoken. The ability to hide his presence….the cheeky kid was actually using his own Shin Meikyō Shisui as well as Fox Illusions to hide his presence.</p><p><br></p><p>Hidemoto looked surprised at the new arrival but relaxed seeing him not take any action.</p><p><br></p><p>“Akira. Are you the backup? Although, it doesn’t seem that they need any.” he looked ahead to see the children fight. Hagoromo Gitsune on the other hand, was immobilising her opponent with just her aura, making the kid realise how badly they had messed up.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a very less known fact but Hagoromo Gitsune was extremely loyal to her husband and these fools….they insulted him in front of her.</p><p><br></p><p>“There are others but they are keeping watch. They will arrive if we need support.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Hiding to not scare away the big fish. Good choice.”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded but didn’t elaborate.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is?” Hidemoto asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“The apprentice of Princess Yasaka of Kyoto and their newest Sage.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A sage? Aren’t sages usually the oldest youkai like Sun Wukong? In fact I can hardly remember the name of three Youkai sages. How did that fox get one so young?” Hidemoto asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have heard of you. A youkai who had been experimented on by the Devils and had escaped their territory after killing his master. There was a huge mess between the devils and the youkai after that.” Yura said. “But from our information, you were just a five tailed fox at the time of escape barely a year or two ago. How did you become a Nine Tailed fox so fast? Doesn’t it take a hundred years to grow a tail for the kitsune youkai?”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s just one way of growing. If someone gains an extraordinary control over Nature energy or becomes stronger than their current limit of tails, they can also grow tails to accommodate their rising strength; however such cases are extremely rare.” Hidemoto explained. “Still, rising to a Nine Tailed fox and a sage at that in two years. Those experiments certainly gave you something good. You must be the youngest sage in all of the world.”</p><p><br></p><p>Akira sent an unfriendly glare towards the man. “That experiment did nothing but injure my body and soul. All of my current progress and powers are a blessing from my Master and due to the teachings of Yasaka-sama. As for being the youngest sage, that title is already taken. Shirone-chan is twelve years old this year and is the youngest sage alive.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Twelve years….”</p><p><br></p><p>He cut the two off.</p><p><br></p><p>“Looks like the fish has taken the bait.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Akira -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He was already looking in the direction of the enemies when they were teleporting.</p><p><br></p><p>One, two, three….all seven remaining heads had arrived headed by their second head, Abe no Yoshihira. Each of them was an Ultimate Class being.</p><p><br></p><p>From their research, the man was a quarter Youkai and the son of Abe no Seimei. He was by far the strongest of their fighters, a prodigy in Onmyojutsu just like his father and also possessing the power to turn into a Nine tailed fox during the night.</p><p><br></p><p>They moved in to surround Hagoromo Gitsune and he too stepped forward to lend a hand but the woman raised a hand to stop him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Stay back and see that none of them run away. It seems that being in Yomi for a few centuries made the world forget about who and what I am and I need to remind them of this.”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the other group and stayed back.</p><p><br></p><p>As for the barriers, that was already being done by the rest.</p><p><br></p><p>Both sides looked at each other.</p><p><br></p><p>She in particular stared at her grandson who looked back at her with an emotionless gaze. Just as she was about to speak, he interrupted her.</p><p><br></p><p>“There is no need for words. You are a Youkai and I have sworn to purify the world of such beings.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh and why exactly? After all, you yourself have my blood running in your veins.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And I suffer due to this cursed blood. I do not wish this curse on anyone else. The Youkai have been getting too strong recently. If left like this, they would soon start encroaching on human territories. This needs to stop….now. And we, as the protectors of this country, will gladly take this responsibility.”</p><p><br></p><p>These people were fools.</p><p><br></p><p>They just looked at the quarter youkai with no expression on their faces until Hagoromo Gitsune broke the silence herself.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are those your own words?” She asked, looking directly at him.</p><p><br></p><p>“....yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You paused. I see. Very well. First let me teach you all some manners and then I will make the ones behind this pay.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Akira, you should go and assist her.” Nurarihyon drew his blade as he spoke but he stopped them.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s fine. We just need to protect the kids. She can take care of herself.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But….so many of them would be too much for her.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Nurarihyon-sama….she is holding back.” he said, making both him and the onmyoji girl stop in their place and look at the scene in front of them in shock.</p><p><br></p><p>The seven heads of the Gokadoin House surrounded the one who had been suppressed on the ground, albeit with difficulty under the suppression of Hagoromo Gitsune’s aura and made hand signs to conjure a heptagram barrier to protect themselves as well as prepare for an attack while Yoshihira himself charged forward to attack.</p><p><br></p><p>Meanwhile Rikuo had combined with another one of his subordinates and inflicted severe injuries on another one of their heads.</p><p><br></p><p>Yoshihira summoned his Heptagram and Akira sensed the change in the weather as dark clouds surrounded the place.</p><p><br></p><p>“He is manipulating rain and lightning to prepare for a spell.” The onmyoji said.</p><p><br></p><p>Meanwhile, Abe no Orochi from their side had summoned her shikigami.</p><p><br></p><p>Eight gigantic serpent heads peaked from the clouds and raced to attack the older Kitsune in the middle of the circle as each of the heads raced in with their own attacks.</p><p><br></p><p>Hagoromo Gitsune stood in the middle of all their attacks and joined her hands in the position of prayer as all her tails gathered, cupping her hands and her voice was heard throughout the field.</p><p><br></p><p>“Domain Expansion.”</p><p><br></p><p>A dilapidated cottage appeared behind her riddled with arrows. There were several weapons piercing the walls of the cottage and it looked as if it would fall at any moment.</p><p><br></p><p>This cottage held the memories of Hagoromo Gitsune. It was the hut where she had lived with her husband, away from the eyes of the general masses. It was the place where she had raised her child, Abe no Seimei and promised to give birth to him as many times as he wanted….and it was also the house where she was killed by the foolish court noble, the act which made Abe no Seimei go berserk and kill everyone in the court.</p><p><br></p><p>In a word, this cottage had seen all phases of Hagoromo Gitsune’s life. It had seen her becoming what she was today.</p><p><br></p><p>It was the place where she was the most comfortable.</p><p><br></p><p>The snake heads and the attacks approached her but in the very next moment, all those attacks, all those enormous snake heads as tall as giant buildings, everything….was made into a pin cushion by all kinds of weapons.</p><p><br></p><p>In all her life, she had reincarnated in various forms and had almost always had a prominent place in the history of the world.</p><p><br></p><p>Be it as a royal concubine of a shogun or the famous general Tomoe Gozen.</p><p><br></p><p>Each of these weapons represented one of her incarnations, each carrying a different power, empowered by her legend. Not only those, there were also weapons by which she had died….including the fabled Nenekirimaru, the Youkai Slaying Sword.</p><p><br></p><p>Hagoromo Gitsune’s original fear is a Presence Type, just like his.</p><p><br></p><p>Presence-based fear users are able to overwhelm an opponent through the sheer immensity of their fear alone. It could be said that theirs is a fear which causes fear, and users often make use of a secondary fear to take advantage of an opponent's hesitation in the face of their \"presence\". Users are frequently either physically huge/grotesque or associated with much older folklore and the strength of their fear is in part due to their legends.</p><p><br></p><p>Normally a nine tailed fox would be similar to a natural calamity but Hagomo Gitsune went around this concept due to her multiple reincarnations with different identities, each having a legend of their own, thus making her what Merlin described as….utterly broken.</p><p><br></p><p>The hundreds of metres area around her had turned into a dense field of weapons.</p><p><br></p><p>All those Gokadoin House members, each one of them had been skewered by the weapons, pinning them down to the ground, completely unconscious.</p><p><br></p><p>Only Yoshihara was struggling a bit.</p><p><br></p><p>“Give up your resistance child.” She spoke, still unphased.</p><p><br></p><p>The man growled. His shouts turned beastly and his body began transforming.</p><p><br></p><p>Red fur grew all over his body as his fingers turned into claws.</p><p><br></p><p>One after another tails appeared from behind him till there were nine and in a few moments, there was a gigantic red nine tailed fox standing in front of them.</p><p><br></p><p>The beast roared, shattering the land around it as it charged towards the woman ….however, it couldn’t even take a couple of steps before countless weapons rained upon him from all angles. The rain continued as did the howls of the injured beast until there was no sound from the other side.</p><p><br></p><p>Even he looked at the woman in shock. He had heard of the stories about her but had never seen her fight and to see the fighting style which she had developed with the help of Master.</p><p><br></p><p>It was frightening.</p><p><br></p><p>As for Nurarihyon and the Onmyoji girl, they were quietly staring at the scene, completely dumbfounded.</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t blame them either.</p><p><br></p><p>“Akira.”</p><p><br></p><p>His thoughts were broken by her voice.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Seal and heal them. We will take them all with us. Nurarihyon.”</p><p><br></p><p>The old man stepped forward.</p><p><br></p><p>“From today onwards, the Gokadoin house is extinct. Spread the word. They have all returned back to their ancestor and will be under my protection, not intervening in the affairs of this country….ever.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Very well. I will spread the word.” the old commander answered.</p><p><br></p><p>“In that case, my work here is done. I will go and clean up the rest as well.”</p><p><br></p><p>He quickly stepped forward, sealing the prisoners and using the healing potions on them.</p><p><br></p><p>This incident should keep the fools on the other side from making any stupid moves for a while.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Sirzechs -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He entered the Belial territory with a hundred thoughts running in his mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Safe to say that he wasn’t the only one there.</p><p><br></p><p>On the way, he had noticed several members of other houses walking in as well.</p><p><br></p><p>The news which had come out was just that stunning.</p><p><br>Cleria Belial had returned back.</p><p><br></p><p>The news was unbelievable because her execution was witnessed by many and her body was then carried away by her family.</p><p><br></p><p>Her being alive would mean she was resurrected.</p><p><br></p><p>A scene flashed back in his mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Was he involved?</p><p><br></p><p>But why?</p><p><br></p><p>During that event he did bring up Cleria Belial’s incident so did he take action?</p><p><br></p><p>Would it mean that he would bring back all those who were killed?</p><p><br></p><p>While happy about the life of the innocent, a sudden wave of headaches also fell over him.</p><p><br></p><p>How would other factions react when their dead start coming back?</p><p><br></p><p>His mother’s resurrection had been kept tightly under wraps by them to avoid such a situation. Only a few others who were at the scene knew of the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>Did someone from the Belial house seek <em>his</em> help after seeing his mother’s situation?</p><p><br></p><p>They would need to do some damage control for this situation.</p><p><br></p><p>Just as he reached outside the Belial Manor, he saw Diehauser Belial outside, waiting to receive him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Diehauser.” he greeted.</p><p><br></p><p>“Lord Lucifer. Please come in.”</p><p><br></p><p>He followed the man inside the mansion.</p><p><br></p><p>“I assume you are here about Cleria?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Congratulations on having your sister back in your lives. I know how it feels to lose someone close and then have them returned back. I am sorry for failing you and your family in the past.” he apologised.</p><p><br></p><p>The scandal of Cleria Belial’s wrongful sentence had created tensions between the government and the Belial House as well as the Emperor of the Rating games, Diehauser, one of the strongest Devils alive, someone on par with the Satans in terms of strength.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let the matters of the past rest in the past. I have my sister back and those responsible for the sorrows of my family have already been punished. I have no one to seek justice from right now.”</p><p><br></p><p>He hesitated for a moment before taking a deep breath and asking. “Did you meet….him?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Damien Lucifer? Yes, I did.”</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t elaborate but it was enough.</p><p><br></p><p>Before he could think more, Diehauser added. “He did say that such a thing was hard to do and he couldn’t do so at will and as such he won’t be taking any more requests for resurrections.”</p><p><br></p><p>He let out an internal sigh of relief. That did assuage a lot of their worries.</p><p><br></p><p>They reached the halls of the manor where a grey haired girl was sitting surrounded by the Lord and Lady of the Belial House.</p><p><br></p><p>All of them looked at him and stood up, bowing lightly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Lord Lucifer.” Lord Belial greeted. He had calmed down a bit after the punishment of the ones involved in the whole scandal but there was still some tension between them.</p><p><br></p><p>“My apologies for intruding at such a time, Lord Belial but this….”</p><p><br></p><p>“I understand.”</p><p><br></p><p>He gave the man a nod and turned to the girl and first bowed lightly.</p><p><br></p><p>“I apologise for not being able to grant you justice.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s fine. I had found things which they wanted to keep hidden. I was informed about everything after my….revival. I am just disappointed that I wasn’t able to reveal everything before they got us.”</p><p><br></p><p>Us?</p><p><br></p><p>Ah yes.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am sorry about your….” he left the words hanging, not knowing which word to use.</p><p><br></p><p>“Lover.” The girl stated without any hesitation.</p><p><br></p><p>Her family members looked at her with apprehensive expressions but she shook her head. “I didn’t deny it when I died once and I won’t deny it now. Masaomi Yaegaki….was my lover. Both of us loved each other but none of us wanted to betray our sides and thus stayed like that.” She turned towards him. “You must know what such a situation is like after all….”</p><p><br></p><p>He winced slightly at the reminder.</p><p><br></p><p>They had used the reason that she was betraying the Devil race and that would break the balance….now looking at their situation from a different <a href=\"https://angle….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">angle….it</a> was eerily similar to his own situation.</p><p><br></p><p>“I apologise for your lover, Masaomi Yaeaki’s death. A week later, we have a meeting of the leaders of the three factions and I will ask Lord Michael to see if his name can be cleared so that he finds justice in the afterlife.” He promised.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the Belial couple looked slightly calmed at the words.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl shook her head. “I appreciate your words but there is no need for that.”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at her surprised. “Did he also?”</p><p><br></p><p>She shook her head. “No. he isn’t resurrected. He….is in heaven.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh!”</p><p><br></p><p>She smiled and their reaction. “Surprised? I was surprised too but it turns out that those who truly live a moral life get a place in heaven no matter what the people of the Church or even the Angels of Heaven name them. It is something controlled by the System of Heaven and was set up by the Father of the Angels. No one else can change it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s….how did you know?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I was told by the person who was there when the entire System was being created and thus possessing the knowledge of the system second only to the creator.”</p><p><br></p><p>They stared at the girl with open mouths.</p><p><br></p><p>“According to him, this was not true for only humans but any race under the Abrahamic factions.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But that would mean….” Lord Belial exclaimed. Even he looked at the girl in shock.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Even the Fallen Angels and….Devils. They do get a chance to choose but with eternal darkness of the void as the second alternative….those rare few who qualify, almost always choose this option.”</p><p><br></p><p>The words were as if a bomb blasted inside his head.</p><p><br></p><p>Devils and Fallen Angels….can go to heaven?</p><p><br></p><p>“Did he….tell you this?” he asked, his voice shaking, still comprehending the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. He even showed me the proof through the Sephiroth Graal.”</p><p><br></p><p>He had the Graal too? Just how many longinuses did that make?</p><p><br></p><p>The girl laughed suddenly. “My apologies. It’s just that I was a little amused at your shock at him possessing the Graal….after all, he took the current wielder of the Graal under his <a href=\"https://wing….in\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">wing….in</a> front of your very eyes.”</p><p><br></p><p>That girl, the princess of the Tepes Clan, Valerie Tepes….was the wielder of the Sephiroth Graal!?</p><p><br></p><p><em>“My primary target was not Gasper. It was Valerie all along.”</em></p><p><br></p><p>His mouth hung open as he recalled the scene and his reply to Rias’ question.</p><p><br></p><p>He knew about Gasper Valdi’s Sacred Gear. He even knew about the hidden potential of the gear and that it was about to evolve into a Longinus Class Sacred Gear soon and yet he was there for Valerie Tepes. Back then the shock of that incident had completely swept away this fact from their minds but now recalling that scene, he couldn’t help but be shocked.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly, he recalled another thing she had said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Were you also….given an option to go to Heaven on your death?”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded. “Yes, I was given the option too.”</p><p><br></p><p>He kept his shock to himself as she explained things further.</p><p><br></p><p>“Funny this is that not even Archangel Michael knew of this. According to <em>him</em>, ‘Michael was always the one with brawn and didn’t understand the finer aspects of Magic.’ You will have to ask him more about this matter in person at the meeting a week from now.”</p><p><br></p><p>“How do you know about the meeting?” he asked, already having realised but still to confirm the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, I pledged my loyalty and services to him. I find his goal of preventing another Great War from happening incredibly wonderful and wish to assist him in doing so. If in doing so, one day, all three factions can come together….and others in my own situation can have a different ending, then I would find my second life to be worth it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Cleria!” Lord Belial raised his voice because her words could have been considered borderline traitorous for normal devils but when considering whom these words were coming from….they held a completely different….a completely new meaning altogether.</p><p><br></p><p>Damien Lucifer….the Devil….wanted peace between the Three Factions.</p><p><br></p><p>The words sounded almost alien to him but from the things he knew about the reincarnated man….he couldn’t deny that there was a slight possibility.</p><p><br></p><p>Could they really?</p><p><br></p><p>Was there really a chance?</p><p><br></p><p>In any case, he had gotten a lot more information than he had expected from this meeting. Now he needed to consult with his fellow Satans. It seems that the meeting in a week was going to be much more serious than any of them had ever expected.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Venelana Gremory -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She explained the situation to the children as they mulled over the fact that Devils did have a chance of getting into the afterlife….and in heaven of all places.</p><p><br></p><p>Cleria Belial’s return and the information she had revealed, had completely shaken all four of them.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Ajuka, the calmest one among them, was a little perturbed. She could tell after knowing him for several centuries.</p><p><br></p><p>It was understandable when knowing the source of the information.</p><p><br></p><p>She could see all kinds of thoughts going on in his mind as he calculated things to find a solution to this problem but to no avail.</p><p><br></p><p>“According to you, the afterlife was similar to falling down endlessly?” He asked as if to reconfirm.</p><p><br></p><p>“I couldn’t sense anything so maybe my head created the illusion of falling. But that’s the closest to how I can explain the situation. It was dark. I could not see but I could <em>feel</em> it. The whole experience is hard to describe in words. I don’t know how long it had been but to me it felt endless. You lose the sense of time there so I am not sure if time even flowed there in the first place.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And you didn’t get a choice?”</p><p><br></p><p>She shook her head. “I was hardly a moral devil in my young days. Back then trading for human souls was not prohibited and as a member of the Bael House, it was something even I went through. I don’t think that would ever grant me a pass according to the standards set by the Father of the Angels.”</p><p><br></p><p>She replied and they pondered.</p><p><br></p><p>“So it’s different from the third Heaven where souls go after their death. From what little I have heard about it from the rare few Fallen Angels….it’s an endless place where the dead live the rest of their lives in wisp-like soul forms. They can change shape but rarely do so. But even Azazel didn’t know the full details of the place. Apparently even Angels are not allowed inside the place except for extremely urgent matters. Could there really be….devil souls in there?”</p><p><br></p><p>“If so then we can count out the older generations.” She threw in her own thoughts and they nodded. “Anyways, I think you should meet Lord Lucifer and seek his opinion on this matter rather than worrying here endlessly. After all, he knew about this even when he created our race and yet didn’t do anything to stop it and assuming from his words, it had remained like this since and yet, we haven’t encountered any problems because of this. So, why worry now?”</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs took a deep breath at her words and spoke up. “Mother is right. Things have been like this since the start and nothing bad happened even when we didn’t know of this. Knowing this is not going to change anything in a week. It’s better if we have a direct talk with Archangel Michael and <em>him</em> before deciding anything.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That would be for the best.” Falbium agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have already told Cleria and the Belials to not disclose this information to anyone else to avoid chaos.”</p><p><br></p><p>“May Lucifer grant you success?” She prayed.</p><p><br></p><p>It had been a habit of hers since Merlin’s suggestions a week ago.</p><p><br></p><p>She never expected any answers. It’s just that she found it….quite soothing.</p><p><br></p><p>But it was as if <em>he</em> wanted to laugh at her ignorance, she heard a word resound within her mind as her eyes grew wide in surprise.</p><p><br></p><p><em>‘Amen.’</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Damien -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“So only the Gokadoin Clan had attacked and unlike what we were informed, they attacked the Nura Clan. I guess those fools at Takamagahara didn’t consider how personal grudges would work when several groups of such people worked together. Thankfully we had kept guards with the prominent targets. What about Yasaka’s daughter and Shirone?”</p><p><br></p><p>“There haven’t been any attacks on them so far but we are on guard.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Keep an eye out for traitors, especially for Yasaka’s people. While she might have cleaned up any people from other factions among her people, many of them would still stab her in the back on the orders of the Shinto, especially if they were offered the throne of Kyoto as a reward for their actions. As the saying goes, it’s easier to guard against an open sword than a hidden dagger.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Very well, I will inform Lady Yasaka of your thoughts.” Akira bowed.</p><p><br></p><p>“How is Hagoromo Gitsune?”</p><p><br></p><p>“She….is taking some time off alone. The people of the Gokadoin House have been imprisoned in a separate dimension made by Miss Gretel, and she will be addressing them soon.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay, then let them take care of that side. Suzaku Himejima has sent some information. The people from the Utsusemi Organisation are working on something big. They haven’t been able to get the exact information about what, but we will attack them as soon as the meeting of the Three Factions takes place. A declaration of peace by the leaders of the Three Factions should keep the people who have been shaken by my revelation at bay for some time. We will take advantage of this time to take out Satanael and his lackeys as well as get the last Holy Relic back.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Master.”</p><p><br></p><p>As I finished my conversation, I heard a knock on the door.</p><p><br></p><p>“Come in.”</p><p><br></p><p>The door opened to reveal my cute little Vienna, peeking inside.</p><p><br></p><p>I gave her a smile and called her in and made her sit on my lap, caressing her head..</p><p><br></p><p>Unlike her usual cheery self, she seemed a bit lost today.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why so glum, Vi?” I asked, seeing that she was not saying anything.</p><p><br></p><p>“I….I heard that you brought back someone from the dead in the Underworld.”</p><p><br></p><p>….yes. I hadn’t talked to her about it.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I did.”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked back at me. “Then can you….”</p><p><br></p><p>I shook her head. “I need more time. A few years more to get everything setup. It’s something I have been planning to do for years and I am very close to it now. Just give me a bit more time.” I replied before she could say anything.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, I was planning to resurrect both Aria and Razevan at the same time along with two of his previous wives.</p><p><br></p><p>I was saving up for the Binder Marks for them.</p><p><br></p><p>But if that happened, I would have to bring back Masaomi and Shuri Himejima as well as a few other people. Those could be done with the Graal but even for that, I would need to wait for Valerie to grow up a bit or I risk harming her.</p><p><br></p><p>In any case, I would need some time.</p><p><br></p><p>She perked up at my reply and hugged me tightly.</p><p><br></p><p>“How is your training going about?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm, very well. Albion is teaching me how to use Divide.” She replied. “I think I can understand bits of the magic.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Great. Then how about this, if you learn Divide, I will give you a surprise gift.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Really!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Promise.”</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing her smile return, I greeted the last guy in the room.</p><p><br></p><p>“Albion.”</p><p><br></p><p>A pair of wings manifested on Vienna’s back.</p><p><br></p><p>“What do you need, Damien?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I was thinking of freeing you from this cage of yours in a year when I am strong enough. What do you think?”</p><p><br></p><p>“....a year? You think you can undo this in a year?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Easily.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then I look forward to such a day.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Just keep a watch on Vienna till then. Things are going to start to get heated up.” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“She is my host. That much goes unsaid.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Good. In that case, I willI will arrange the sparring match against your eternal rival in a week.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I look forward to it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So do I.” I replied.</p><p><br></p><p>Right at this moment, I heard a voice in my thoughts.</p><p><br></p><p>I identified it immediately as my latest mark.</p><p><br></p><p>Venelana Gremory.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t know what Merlin had told her but she had developed a habit of praying to me since then.</p><p><br></p><p>I never replied to any of those thinking that she would give up the foolishness but she didn’t. In fact, her feelings were completely genuine everytime.</p><p><br></p><p>I wonder if that’s how <em>he</em> felt when hearing the prayers of his devotees?</p><p><br></p><p>Shaking my head of the wild thoughts, I decided to humour the she-devil a bit at her latest prayer as I sent a reply through the mental link.</p><p><br></p><p>“Amen.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Kokabiel -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Is it confirmed?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes my lord. Cleria Belial has indeed come back from the dead.”</p><p><br></p><p>“First <em>he</em> comes back from hell and now he starts to bring back other of his abominations. What’s next? He brings back the other three as well? Azazel doesn’t understand the urgency. If we give him time, he will get back all his armies and then we will be like a fish on a chopping board. This is no time to sit back and wish for peace. Something needs to be done and very soon at that. If Azazel doesn’t do it, then I will. What do the other cadres have to say about this matter?”</p><p><br></p><p>“....the entire faction is divided on the matter. A major part of the people want nothing to do with another war but there are still a few who want to attack him before he can do anything….it’s just that….”</p><p><br></p><p>“They are afraid?” he asked.</p><p><br></p><p>His subordinate nodded, not even daring to look at him.</p><p><br></p><p>He clenched his fist. It’s not like he hadn’t seen that for himself.</p><p><br></p><p>Those devils had made a show of his revival.</p><p><br></p><p>He and Michael had always been stronger than other angels. Father had always favoured him. Even when he had questioned his decisions, he had tolerated him.</p><p><br></p><p>It showed because Father didn’t deem him unworthy of his light even when he had left Heaven of his own will.</p><p><br></p><p>On the other hand, the rest were treated with extreme strictness, losing their place in Heaven at the slightest of mistakes.</p><p><br></p><p>That man….how dare he….how dare he throw away everything they had desired and still be favoured.</p><p><br></p><p>But this reincarnated form of him was different.</p><p><br></p><p>That kind of power….none of the angels could possess that kind of power.</p><p><br></p><p>It was rumoured that the two abominations of the Devil Race, the fake ones who called themselves Lucifer and Beelzebub had similar powers, most probably propaganda to keep other races at bay.</p><p><br></p><p>And it worked too.</p><p><br></p><p>But while that may have been a propaganda….this was real.</p><p><br></p><p>Tens of thousands of Devils….all downed with just a glare. This power brought about memories of two other incidents.</p><p><br></p><p>One against the Youkai of Kyoto and the other with the other in Romania against the Vampires. Entire cities had been rendered unconscious….even their leaders.</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t know if those were done by him alone or if he had the help of others but if….if by any chance he could do it on his own….then there was no way he could fight him without the cooperation of several other cadres.</p><p><br></p><p>But that problem can be solved. After all, it’s not like <em>he</em> had any shortage of enemies.</p><p><br></p><p>Many people want him to stay dead, both inside and outside of the three factions. He just needed to find ones with enough hatred and power to be of use.</p><p><br></p><p>But who?</p><p><br></p><p>The fools at the church were more than eager to take down the Devil but didn’t have the guts after seeing his strength and then there was also Michael suddenly regaining his guts from somewhere, keeping a tight leash on them.</p><p><br></p><p>If not the normal members of the three factions then maybe someone who had been cast out….after all there was no shortage of those.</p><p><br></p><p>He will have to plan.</p><p><br></p><p>“Find the traces of our recently outcast brother. We will need his help. Also send a word to Valper, accelerate the research. I will provide him with anything he needs.”</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am back with another chapter of ‘The Deal’.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>In this chapter, we mainly saw the things which happened with others as a result of Damiens actions.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>After all, the Devil coming back from the dead is not a small incident and it’s bound to raise the blood pressure of several factions and rightly so.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>We will see how the factions outside the Three Factions react to his reveal and the next meeting of the Three Factions.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Things have just started getting interesting as the villains have begun cooking up their plans.

From what we found out, it was the prototype of the disease and a stronger version was used for her. We will need around a month to make an antidote for it.”</p><p><br></p><p>Helena, my main scientist, was not here at the moment so I needed to make do with these people. That is not to say they weren’t good enough but were far behind Helena Dantalion, who was gifted a nerfed Mad Doctor Essence by me.</p><p><br></p><p>It’s been two days since the entire fiasco and the whole Underworld was in turmoil.</p><p><br></p><p>Those four Satans got off their butts and started working as their roles.</p><p><br></p><p>With a direct ‘order’ from me in front of the entire Underworld, they had gone all out on the Great King faction.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone was investigated and anyone who was found to have been involved in murders of fellow Pillars, plotting against other Pillar Houses, using the Sleeping Sickness as well as any acts of treachery were all either executed or jailed.</p><p><br></p><p>WIth Zekram as a precedent, no one questioned.</p><p><br></p><p>They didn’t dare.</p><p><br></p><p>Not even their family members.</p><p><br></p><p>Questioning or raising any kind of voice right now would have been going against the entire Devil Race.</p><p><br></p><p>I’ll be honest, even I didn’t expect Lucifer’s name to have this much power in the Underworld right now.</p><p><br></p><p>There have been some unwanted consequences of the enthusiasm of these Devils.</p><p><br></p><p>“Has the crowd outside the Gremory estate been cleared?” I asked Merlin as we left the place together.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. They are not entering the Estate because you were seen to be familiar with them but they are not leaving either. It’s not just the Gremory Estate but the same case with every Satans’ families as well as their castles. All of them wish to know where you are.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sigh. Someone will do something stupid if this continues. You should go and take care of this matter. Actually, take Gretel, Akira and Valerie with you too.”</p><p><br></p><p>Akira and Valerie would be able to meet Akane and Gasper. They had been worried about them the whole time.</p><p><br></p><p>It would do well for them to go and see for themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>And while you are there….invite them to a meeting of the Three Factions. Rizevim is going to make some big moves….and with the tools available to him, we all need to be prepared.” I ordered.</p><p><br></p><p>Euclid could only give me some information about his plans.</p><p><br></p><p>Rizevim was keeping everything to himself till the last moment.</p><p><br></p><p>He was wary of the spies more than ever as there was a chaos in the Old Satan faction since my reveal, both as Damien Lucifer Asmodeus and the reincarnation of Lucifer.</p><p><br></p><p>The latter was still only a rumour to other people but it was spreading at an insane speed everywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>It was causing many people to question their allegiance in the Old Satan faction as well.</p><p><br></p><p>Knowing him, to prevent that, Rizevim was going to do something big.</p><p><br></p><p>“As you order, my King.”</p><p><br></p><p>I teleported to the next location as Merlin left.</p><p><br></p><p>The floating island of Agreas.</p><p><br></p><p>The only place where Ageresite, the crystals used to make the Evil Pieces, were found.</p><p><br></p><p>King Pieces were merely a fraction of what these Crystals could be used for.</p><p><br></p><p>If used properly, these were strong enough to rival the Amrita of the Hindu Pantheon.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t have every memory of Lucifer but I knew that this place was very dear to him.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t know why though.</p><p><br></p><p>Even then, I didn’t want to use it willy nilly.</p><p><br></p><p>As for the Ageresite, I can produce it with my Mad Doctor Essence so it was never an issue.</p><p><br></p><p>The main objective was to remove this from the reach of the current Government.</p><p><br></p><p>The current Devil race was not in danger of going extinct due to low numbers.</p><p><br></p><p>What they were however in danger of was the unplanned and uncontrolled increase in number with the Evil Pieces as well as the way they were used.</p><p><br></p><p>The worst part was, the Evil Pieces were so deeply ingrained in the society of the devil race that it would have been a massive pain to remove it.</p><p><br></p><p>This was the best method.</p><p><br></p><p>With this removed, they will be forced to work with what they have.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the main reasons the Reincarnated Devils were treated badly was because many saw them as replaceable.</p><p><br></p><p>If some of them rebelled, they could always be declared as Stray Devils and they could get a replacement for their Evil Pieces.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, though, they will not have that privilege. Because there will be no new Evil Piece sets.</p><p><br></p><p>The owners will have to keep their peerage members satisfied and in control to avoid such problems.</p><p><br></p><p>Not to mention the decrease in the number of newly Reincarnated Devils will calm down the other factions.</p><p><br></p><p>They wouldn’t go as far as to attack us due to the show I had put up but they will be reassured that their people will not be reincarnated against their wishes and maybe not now but in a few centuries, it could improve the overall impression of the Devil faction as a whole.</p><p><br></p><p>It also removed a dangerous trump card from Ajuka’s hand.</p><p><br></p><p>We stored the island away in a separate dimension made by the Balance Breaker of the Dimension Lost and then each of us had reinforced the Barrier around the place several times over.</p><p><br></p><p>For now, this place is better off left sealed.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Sirzechs -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He sat with his fellow Satans in the Lucifer’s office.</p><p><br></p><p>In front of him stood two people.</p><p><br></p><p>Helena Dantalion and Charlene Glasya-Labolas.</p><p><br></p><p>Both of them had shown extremely high strength during the terrorist attack. Taking down Ultimate Class beings with casual ease.</p><p><br></p><p>Falbium had talked to his sister and found out that she was undergoing some secret form of training with Helena as a trial for an experiment.</p><p><br></p><p>He just didn’t know it was so effective.</p><p><br></p><p>On testing, their power levels were similar to Grayfia and Serafall. In fact, Charlene was even stronger in terms of sheer Demonic Power alone. Almost twice as strong too.</p><p><br></p><p>Helena had straightaway denied publicising the method or even sharing it, stating it as a secret of the Dantalion House and even Charlene was under a binding contract to not reveal it.</p><p><br></p><p>Not that they would force anyone. It would be a catastrophe if these talents were to go to their enemies if forced hard.</p><p><br></p><p>They were called here for a different reason.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am sorry but I will have to reject your offer. I cannot join your peerage. I have my own research to carry on and my own targets to achieve. I cannot devote my time to other goals.” Helena Dantalion said, looking at Ajuka.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. She was invited by Ajuka Beelzebub to become his Queen.</p><p><br></p><p>“You can continue your work even as my Queen.” He offered.</p><p><br></p><p>“I’m sorry but I wish to remain independent.” She rejected.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sigh, in that case, would you like to work as the Vice Director of the Devil Research and Development?”</p><p><br></p><p>“...I am really honoured that you would consider me for such a position but I already have my own Bibliotheca Research and Development organisation. It is affiliated with the Dantalion House and is also funded by several other houses. I am contract bound to not leave it.” She answered after some hesitation.</p><p><br></p><p>Ajuka let out a sigh. “Well, it was worth a try. By the way, can a corporation be possible between our two organisations? I know that Devil Research and Development is a government organisation but Bibliotheca can be given a semi government status. In return you can get investments from the Government for your projects.”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked to be in thought. “As long as the contract doesn’t violate any of the existing contracts I can think about it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Very well. In that case, I will have someone look into the contract.” Ajuka replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay. I will talk with other associates of mine.”</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, Falbium addressed them both.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, I understand that you will not be divulging the methods behind the training and joining any peerages is out of question as you are the Heiress but you will have to participate in the Rating Games and show off your power.”</p><p><br></p><p>Charlene looked a bit confused so Falbium explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“Right now, the Underworld is in a precarious situation. We lost several High Level Ultimate Class Beings as well as many old Devils were executed or locked up. The Old Satan faction is moving and probably the only reason they haven’t launched an attack on us yet is because of the appearance of… Lucifer.”</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Many were still coping with the fact that the creator of their race was actually back.</p><p><br></p><p>“In fact, even the other factions are not attacking us because of the absurd show of power by <em>him</em> and his followers. It’s just that… he is not really with us. The only reason he came out was due to Lilith and we are not even sure he will return if a war was to start.” Not that any of them had the courage to go and ask him just after all that mess.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So, we need strong people to showcase their powers to keep the other factions at bay. For this reason, I would like you two to participate in Rating Games.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Rating Games? I thought they were being shut down for a while due to the disappearance of the Agreas island and the Agerasite Crystals?” Helena asked. “Have they been found already?”</p><p><br></p><p>He winced a bit at the question.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>The Agreas Island.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a topic which had been the reason for their headache for the last two days. </p><p><br></p><p>The rebels had teleported the entire island to some other dimension and even Ajuka couldn't find any clues about their location. The search was still on going.</p><p><br></p><p>According to the rebels, the island was the cause of all their troubles and they were removing it to prevent such things from happening again. </p><p><br></p><p>What a load of bullshit.</p><p><br></p><p>They would obviously be trying to create more King Pieces to plan another, bigger rebellion next time.</p><p><br></p><p>\"The distribution of new Evil Pieces has been stopped. Rating Games will still continue.\" Ajuka explained. </p><p><br></p><p>\"Is there any news about the Agreas Island?\"</p><p><br></p><p>“We are still investigating.” Ajuka replied, not answering clearly.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Umm… can’t you ask <em>him</em> for help? He could change other races to devils so… Even the people outside want to see him. He could pacify them easily. If all the Pillars ask him...” Helena left her sentence unfinished.</p><p><br></p><p>He shook his head. “He has made it abundantly clear that he doesn’t want to intervene in the affairs of the Underworld and we do not wish to disturb him.” To be honest, the thought of asking for his help did come to his mind but he held back.</p><p><br></p><p>How could they?</p><p><br></p><p>Especially not after such a blunder.</p><p><br></p><p>His last appearance had already saved the whole Underworld from going into a war as well as the life of his mother. It was already something he didn’t know how to repay.</p><p><br></p><p>To ask for even more…</p><p><br></p><p>They were not even sure if he would even agree to meet them.</p><p><br></p><p>“You all know where he is?” Helena asked., recognising his thoughts</p><p><br></p><p>He thought for a bit and nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“We do. However we are not to disturb him until he wishes to talk to us himself.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. It’s unfortunate.”</p><p><br></p><p>They discussed a few things and left a few minutes later.</p><p><br></p><p>“She really didn’t budge.” Serafall said.</p><p><br></p><p>“We knew it wouldn’t be so easy. If she has developed a method to make someone get to such a level, she wouldn’t be revealing the secrets so easily. I even had a chat with Lord Dantalion and even he didn’t know anything. He was quite surprised himself at the strength of his little sister but the man dotes so much on her that he would never ask her anything she didn’t want to answer.”</p><p><br></p><p>“She did say something about her investors. If we can find who they are, we could get something from them.” Ajuka suggested.</p><p><br></p><p>“She is one of the foremost researchers in the Underworld. Almost every Pillar House has invested in her in one way or another. And someone who has invested in such a project will not be revealing the details so easily. But yes, there is a chance.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you question the families of the terrorists?” He asked Falbium.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Each and everyone of them is being investigated. We have questioned them individually as well as in groups and none of them seem to know of anything. They did say that they had started behaving oddly after the Youkai incident and being captured in Kyoto, which was when the restrictions on them were imposed.” Falbium answered.</p><p><br></p><p>“It could be…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It could be the Old Satan faction…” Serafall suggested.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, it could be, especially knowing what kind of a madman Rizevim Livan Lucifer is and his so-called game against Lucifer.</p><p><br></p><p>He was actually one of the biggest suspects of the whole thing but again, there was no way they could accuse him of anything right now.</p><p><br></p><p>Zekram and the Great King faction had made a veritable mess of the entire Underworld even with its fall.</p><p><br></p><p>The economy was in shambles all of a sudden and while not to the extent it could have been due to Damien’s appearance, no house dared to shut down their functioning, afraid to be the next Bael House, the sudden disappearance of so many of the old devils still caused a lot of problems.</p><p><br></p><p>These problems were aggravated by the people wanting to know where Lucifer had gone and wanting him to return. It was not only the common Devils but the same was true for many Pillar Houses as well.</p><p><br></p><p>Even now, a huge crowd was gathered outside their castles as well as the homes of their families, wanting to know his whereabouts.</p><p><br></p><p>“If it’s really them, then we might have a way to cooperate with Dami-Lucifer against it. They were at odds and Rizevim gaining such a card against him is not something he would want or allow. We can try to cooperate with him.” She suggested.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p><br></p><p>They had even considered that it might have been his own group which had taken away the Agreas Island but given up on that thought immediately because it didn’t make any sense.</p><p><br></p><p>First, with Damien’s identity, all he needed was to speak and the Underworld would have placed the island outside his doorsteps.</p><p><br></p><p>Second, with his ability through which he empowered Rias, he could reproduce the effects of King Pieces beyond anything Ajuka could.</p><p><br></p><p>And thirdly, he was Lucifer. He didn’t need any Evil Pieces to change others into Devils.</p><p><br></p><p>So ultimately, while it was convenient, it couldn’t do anything which he already couldn’t do on his own.</p><p><br></p><p>At this point, they were reminded of the words of Kuroka, the Sage.</p><p><br></p><p>‘Why would the owner of an ant farm be jealous of the ant queen.’</p><p><br></p><p>Back then, they had all laughed it away at the young Nekoshou’s fanatical worship of her master or the natural pride and arrogance of a Lucifer but now… looking at the current situation, he was forced to reconsider his thoughts.</p><p><br></p><p>Just as he was thinking about these, there was a knock on the door.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>The door opened and a staff member came in with a nervous look.</p><p><br></p><p>“My Lords, i-it’s the aides of Lucifer. They have arrived at the Gremory Estate.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Who and how many?” He asked, suddenly.</p><p><br></p><p>“There are four people. Merlin Ambrosius, Gretel Lucifuge, Akira the Kitsune and a young Dhamphir girl.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Very well. I will receive them myself.” He exchanged a glance with his fellow Satans and answered.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Zeoticus Gremory -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the four people in front of him with complex emotions.</p><p><br></p><p>The servants of Lucifer.</p><p><br></p><p>By now there was no doubt about it.</p><p><br></p><p>The Old Satan faction, in their efforts to create a weapon against them, had resurrected the Devil accidentally.</p><p><br></p><p>Even if there was some doubt after several of the undeniable evidence and even his ancestor confirming it, it was washed away as he felt the warmth of his wife beside him and remembered the scene when he had brought her back from death, and declared his identity.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a scene he doubted he would forget till the end of his life.</p><p><br></p><p>They had asked Venelana about what she had felt after dying.</p><p><br></p><p>According to her, it was darkness, there was nothing and there was a feeling of falling down continuously. But there she heard a voice, a command and a small light shone in the corner of that darkness, almost similar to the Morning Star and then she was dragged out of that darkness and the next thing she knew, she was there.</p><p><br></p><p>It felt a moment to her, almost like a dream but the experience was as real as it could get.</p><p><br></p><p>And now the servant’s of the same man had come to visit them.</p><p><br></p><p>Not to mention their identities.</p><p><br></p><p>Gretel Lucifuge.</p><p><br></p><p>Akira.</p><p><br></p><p>And Valerie Tepes.</p><p><br></p><p>All three of them have some kind of relationship to the members of his household.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you in good health?” His thoughts were broken by Merlin’s question. He realised that the question was focused towards Venelana and not him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.” She bowed. “I will be eternally grateful to Lord Lucifer for his kindness.</p><p><br></p><p>“You can thank him on your own, ya know. Just close your eyes, and pray. He will listen. Whether he answers or not is a different thing entirely.” Merlin smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>The moment of silence stretched longer than he had hoped for and that made him have a premonition.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you serious?” he asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“You could always try.”  Merlin shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>“In that case, I will try.” Venelana answered.</p><p><br></p><p>“While we cannot assert how much you are welcomed here Mr. Ambrosius, could you tell us why you have decided to visit us at this time?” His mother asked, shifting the topic.</p><p><br></p><p>It was something they needed to do at a different time.</p><p><br></p><p>“Me? I heard that Sairaorg Bael was living here. The child wanted to become a Satan and Damien took a liking to the boy. In fact even I was quite impressed by his will. I have heard that despite Damien’s words, there has been less than positive attitude towards the boy and his family so… I wish to take him as a student.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“You know how I am somewhat known to be a guy who can teach Kings and such…” Merlin scratched his head and he had the urge to throw his shoe at the man’s face.</p><p><br></p><p>Teach a King?</p><p><br></p><p>This guy had taught Arthur Pendragon.</p><p><br></p><p>That person alone had killed several Ultimate Class Devils and countless others during his lifetime including a few of his friends.</p><p><br></p><p>He took a deep breath and reminded himself of the current identity of the man in front of him.</p><p><br></p><p>Right now, he represented the Asmodeus House more than any other full Devil of the Asmodeus house could do because of his Master.</p><p><br></p><p>He was still amazed at the fact that Lucifer had managed to recruit someone like him knowing their history with each other.</p><p><br></p><p>Merlin continued, not caring about his inner thoughts. “I wish to train the guy because I believe he can bring about a great change.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Is this the will of your Master?” His mother asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Damien? No. He doesn’t have anything to do with it. It’s just my own personal wish. Damien just wanted me to come here and calm down the crowd who were making noise outside. He’s worried that Rizevim might use this opportunity to incite the people and start a war. Would be a waste when he went through so much effort to stop one just a couple of days ago.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>That was a terrifying thought indeed.</p><p><br></p><p>“And while I’m at it, I decided to bring the rest with me to meet their family members… ahahaha at least who wanted to meet.” he quickly corrected himself at the glare thrown by Gretel Lucifuge.</p><p><br></p><p>They looked at the last two members who were standing quietly behind him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Rias.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes father.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Take them to meet your peerage members and show them around the house. Grayfia, please accompany them and see if they need anything.” He ordered.</p><p><br></p><p>Grayfia threw a fleeting glance towards Gretel but agreed quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>Merlin also took the chance to look at the silver haired young woman on his side. “Please accompany them and see that they don’t get rowdy… I mean it would reflect poorly on Damien if they didn’t behave properly.” he smiled and added at the end, making her glare harder.</p><p><br></p><p>She nonetheless bowed slightly towards everyone and followed.</p><p><br></p><p>As they left the room, Merlin let out a breath finally.</p><p><br></p><p>“Phew, Gre-chan needs to relax a bit. Always so serious and scary.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And yet you are not afraid of provoking her.” His mother rolled her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha I enjoy living life on the edge.” He laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>At the same time, Sirzechs and the rest of the Satans arrived and from the other end, his ancestor did as well.</p><p><br></p><p>“Merlin.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sirzechs.”</p><p><br></p><p>The two greeted each other.</p><p><br></p><p>And the atmosphere in the room completely changed.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am here with a warning from my King regarding the current circumstances.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Serafall -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Warning?” Sirzechs asked as they narrowed their eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“To explain everything, let’s take a bit of a history lesson shall we.”</p><p><br></p><p>Great. Another lesson.</p><p><br></p><p>“Agreas Island held a very important place in Devil Society even before the wizkid over here invented his special chess pieces. Do any of you know why?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It was the place where the previous Satans had their labs.” Ajuka answered in a monotone.</p><p><br></p><p>“Bingo. There are a few more reasons. But let’s understand something right now. Agreas Island held the power to overturn the Great War and give the Devil side a chance of victory even against the Father of the Angels and yet… none of the four Satans, even in the desperation of losing their lives, used that method.” Merlin said in an ominous tone. “Any guesses?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Create an army of King Pieces or similar artifact users? While that would have certainly won them the war, all other Factions would have turned against them at that very moment, fearing such power and wouldn’t have stopped till the Devil Race was completely extinct. It was one of the reasons I never created any more of them.” Ajuka replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“You created? Hahahaha, no dear. You didn’t create them. Did you?” Merlin asked, with narrowed eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you saying that I’m lying?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am saying that while they might have certainly come into existence from your hands… you didn’t create them. Am I wrong in saying that?” He repeated with a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>The two sides exchanged gazes with each other.</p><p><br></p><p>“They were created accidentally.” Ajuka accepted. “I never recreated any after those.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well that’s what Damien guessed.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What exactly are you insinuating here, Merlin?” Sirzechs asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am saying that while it was for the sake of the Devil race, you all should still have been careful when dealing with things on Agreas. It was something feared by even the four Satans so much so that they had it sealed and all secrets of its whereabouts were kept only to them and the Six Clans of Lucifer, all of whom had died in the Great War. But it seems someone else was able to find them too and to make matters worse, they have found their way into the hands of Rizevim.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What exactly are you talking about?” Sirzechs asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“The Malebranche.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The details will be explained by Damien himself but for now understand that they were artifacts created by the four Satans based on the Sacred Gears. Sentient artifacts rivalling even the Longinuses. They were called Demonic Arms. But the Satans feared their power, so much so that even if they won the Great War with their power, there wouldn’t have been anything left of the world as they would have rampaged and destroyed everything regardless. The artifact you saw on Euclid… it was a mere replica of the weakest among them.” He said, looking in Sirzechs’ direction.</p><p><br></p><p>It was then she remembered about the Romania Incident and the weapon Sirzechs had reported to be in Euclid’s possession which elevated his powers a lot.</p><p><br></p><p>“And they were…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Made from the Crystals of Agreas Island… Agresite.”</p><p><br></p><p>Fuck!</p><p><br></p><p>“So Rizevim can…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Assuming he has the island, yes. He could create more of them. He must have the Book of Lucifer so he might have some clues. But even if he couldn’t create more, there were already twelve of those and they are in the hands of Rizevim from what we have seen of Euclid. Damien has been trying to find their whereabouts and while he is sure that they are with Rizevim, he doesn’t know their exact location. It is something which can and knowing the kind of person Rizevim is, will cause a second Great War.” he said with utmost seriousness making the atmosphere in the room suffocating.</p><p><br></p><p>Twelve more Longinus level Demonic Sacred Gears… in the hands of Rizevim.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the thought of such a thing made the entire Bael debacle seem like a piece of cake.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thus… in two weeks' time, my King, Damien Lucifer Asmodeus, has called for a meeting of the leaders of the Three Factions to discuss this matter. I, on behalf of my King, am here to deliver the message.” Merlin said.</p><p><br></p><p>“A meeting of the Three Factions?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. He doesn’t want any more wars among the Three Factions and we believe that the current Leaders of the factions don’t want the same either. The venue is the 733H Bar, two weeks from now.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Azazel -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“A Meeting of the Three Faction Leaders?” Shemhazai asked again, making sure.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. It seems to be the case.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Those old fools really did mess with the wrong person. Lilith... Her of all people being kept as a prisoner? I really thought Damien was going to start a massacre back then.”</p><p><br></p><p>He did the same.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, he had moved a large amount of forces to the borders of the Devil Territories to prevent any invasions during such a time if a war were to start due to that mess.</p><p><br></p><p>But the ending was not something he was expecting.</p><p><br></p><p>The broadcast showed everything on the scene.</p><p><br></p><p>From the appearance of Rizevim to the arrival of Damien along with his subordinates. The show of power which casually took down the entire Old Satan Faction forces in a moment.</p><p><br></p><p>He had heard about the power twice before this, once during the Kyoto debacle and the other during the Romania incident and seeing it in action just made it even more intimidating.</p><p><br></p><p>And Damien was not the only one who could do so. Even his subordinates were the same.</p><p><br></p><p>Had he devised a new spell or even a new system of magic?</p><p><br></p><p>Really, even reincarnated, this brother of theirs always left him in awe with his talents.</p><p><br></p><p>But even so, how could they even fight such enemies?</p><p><br></p><p>They were clearly all stronger than even him, had Longinuses and now even numbers didn’t work on them. He shivered at the thought of what would have happened if Father knew of this magic when he was alive.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe only a fraction of them would have been left compared to what they were now.</p><p><br></p><p>There was utter chaos among the Grigori, both among the Cadres and the lower Ranks at the appearance of Damien two days ago. Some didn’t dare to go out of their houses and returned back to the Grigori Headquarters from all over the world while some wanted to start another war right at that moment but everyone quieted down at the display of power from him and his forces.</p><p><br></p><p>Even more so, seeing his reputation and command over the Devil Race even now, with a single appearance was a sight to behold.</p><p><br></p><p>It was quite similar to what his father would receive in Heaven if he were to return back right now.</p><p><br></p><p>But the surprises didn’t stop there.</p><p><br></p><p>Those rebels had stolen Agreas Island.</p><p><br></p><p>At first, he had laughed at the audacity of the rebels and in schadenfreude. It was about time someone removed their magic stone quarry. But then, realising just what those crazy bastards had in their hands, increased his tensions even more.</p><p><br></p><p>Especially considering the newly revealed information.</p><p><br></p><p>The King Pieces.</p><p><br></p><p>And now Celine came and dropped this invitation.</p><p><br></p><p>But maybe this was exactly what they needed</p><p><br></p><p>A discussion about how to deal with the large amount of information that had been revealed and what steps to take moving forward.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tell him that we will be there.” He replied, looking at Celine.</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>One moment he was enjoying a drink, reminiscing about the old days and another moment, he had to worry about preventing another Great War.</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously, screw Zekram Bael.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe he should have had that guy ambushed and killed despite the heavy casualties back during the Great War.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Sean -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Seriously, why did the Boss have to send us to this place?” He complained to himself as he walked towards the city in front of him.</p><p><br></p><p>“I mean there are very few options when you think carefully about it.” The shorty with him shrugged. “Teacher was sent to the current Government with the others due to the chaos going on there. He is obviously the most adept in handling those situations compared to let’s say Lady Gretel or even Lady Ingvild. The former is not good at communicating in such situations while the latter would have been sucked into the flow by the people due to pitying them. She is too kind hearted. Miss Celine was sent to the Fallen Angels as an obvious choice. As for this place, among his direct subordinates, it was either you, me, Asia Argento or Meridith Ordinton. The last one is too young and Miss Asia would have been a slap to the face of the Church.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t think the Boss would mind slapping them. If anything, he would have purposely done that and even stood on the side to watch their reaction and then taunt them.” he shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>“... and Miss Asia would have the same problem as Lady Ingvild. She is just too kind for her own good.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, I can agree on that. Anyways, having the heir of the Pendragon family guide my way would certainly make things easier.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I wouldn’t count on that. My Father made it quite clear that I wouldn’t be allowed back in the family if I followed Merlin against his will. The same was the case for Ley Fey. The Church would be informed about it too. They will know exactly who we are because your face was identified by the ones following Lord Michael during the last meeting too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah yes. There was that.”</p><p><br></p><p>By that time they had reached the gates of the city.</p><p><br></p><p>“Who goes there?” The guards shouted at them.</p><p><br></p><p>“We are messengers.” He replied as he walked closer.</p><p><br></p><p>“Whose messengers? And whom are you sending the message to?”</p><p><br></p><p>________________________________________x_________________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, screw Boss’ ‘I don’t lie’ skit. See where that lead us to?” He grumbled as he saw the crowd surrounding them, weapons drawn out towards them. There was another row of priests behind them, readying their spells, all ready to attack at any moment.</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t think you should have started with the Boss’ name.” Little Arthur said as he drew out the Holy Sword Caliburn and took on a stance, covering his back to protect against any surprise attack.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh yeah. I guess it was a point I didn’t consider. My bad.” He shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hand back the sword. It is the property of the Church. Filth like you who follow the Devil himself don’t deserve the honour of wielding such a blade. Do that and we will make your death painless.” The one in the front, a guy with a holy sword said, eying Arthur’s sword.</p><p><br></p><p>The greed in his eyes was clear to see.</p><p><br></p><p>Really.</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes, he wished he didn’t have this kind of Observation Haki.</p><p><br></p><p>It also made him understand why the Boss dislikes these kinds of people so much.</p><p><br>While not everyone was like this, a large part of the crowd had similar feelings. More than trying to do something good, they wanted to get the spear for some kind of self interest.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, if this is the way you all treat a Messenger, then I will speak your language as well. So much for diplomacy.” He narrowed his eyes and summoned his Sacred Gear.</p><p><br></p><p>True Longinus.</p><p><br></p><p>A holy aura fell on the entire place. He infused his magic into the spear and slammed the stub end of the spear on the ground, sending a shockwave around the place, throwing all of them away from the force of the attack.</p><p><br></p><p>His aura released in earnest, pressuring the ones who had just gotten up back to their knees again.</p><p><br></p><p>A crater was formed in the place they were standing.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have no words to speak to any of you. All I want is to deliver a letter for Archangel Michael to Seraph Ariel, who is stationed here. If that can be done in a peaceful way. I would be more than pleased to do so. But if you people want to use violence…” He used the Spear to take on a stance. “Then I will reply in kind.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>The entire crowd was stunned at the appearance of the spear.</p><p><br></p><p>Many of them were enraged and wanted to attack them even then but were held back due to his aura.</p><p><br></p><p>“There will be no fighting.” A voice came from a distance.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked around to see a familiar gigantic looking man walking forward with some others.</p><p><br></p><p>Vasco Strada.</p><p><br></p><p>He was followed by the upcoming exorcist and the so-called Trump Card of Heaven, Dulio Gesualdo.</p><p><br></p><p>Behind them were a few other famous names.</p><p><br></p><p>Edward Griseldi, Griselda Quarta and a few other names.</p><p><br></p><p>They saw his spear and even Arthur’s sword and their eyes narrowed. These ones however didn’t have greed in their hearts. It was something different.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are…” Vasco looked at him.</p><p><br></p><p>“My name is Sean Collins and my companion is Arthur Pendragon.” he announced, earning several murmurs and surprised looks at the little guy’s identity. “We are messengers of our Lord Damien Lucifer, bearing a message for Archangel Michael. We simply wish to hand over the letter to the Seraph stationed here.” He continued.</p><p><br></p><p>The newcomers except Strada tensed at the name of the Boss too but didn’t make any overt moves.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. I will inform Lord Ariel of it.” Vasco replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“But Cardinal Strada, they have the Holy Sword and the Spear with the Lord’s Will with them. The greatest treasures of the Church and they serve <em>him</em>… how can we?”</p><p><br></p><p>“That is not on us to decide. It is a decision for Lord Michael. Our work is to inform him. I will convey the news of their arrival to Lady Ariel.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That won’t be necessary.” A flash of light descended in front of them as a massive Holy Aura washed over the surroundings.</p><p><br></p><p>When the light disappeared, there stood an Angel with ten wings.</p><p><br></p><p>A Seraph.</p><p><br></p><p>Ariel, the angel of nature.</p><p><br></p><p>The entire crowd quieted down with the arrival of the Seraph.</p><p><br></p><p>The Angel in question however had her gaze occupied by the Spear in his hands.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have heard of you. The current wielder of the True Longinus and the reincarnation of the son of Lugh, Cú Chulainn, Ireland’s child of light and the strongest wielder of the spear since father himself.” She said, causing a massive commotion at his identity.</p><p><br></p><p>Although one information was wrong though.</p><p><br></p><p>He was third in the list of the Spear’s wielders, strength wise speaking but let’s not go down that rabbit hole right now.</p><p><br></p><p>“And it seems those praises were not an exaggeration either. With the level of power I am sensing from you, anyone except the Great Seraphs won’t be a match for you even without Father’s Spear. Thank you for holding back on these people.”</p><p><br></p><p>The crowd backed away a few steps in shock at the revelation.</p><p><br></p><p>“For what reason have you come here?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do I have permission to speak in private?”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at him for a moment and then nodded despite the protests of several others.</p><p><br></p><p>They were led to a private room.</p><p><br></p><p>On reaching there he bowed a little and Arthur followed. “We were tasked by our Master to deliver this letter to Archangel Michael. There has been a certain incident which, if not dealt with properly, might devolve into something much worse… perhaps another Great War even. For this reason, our Master has called upon a meeting of the leaders of the Three Factions. This is a letter detailing the circumstances.” He handed over the letter to her.</p><p><br></p><p>Her eyes widened at the revelation as she took the letter to peruse, the colour in her face drained slightly and then a look of anger came to her face.</p><p><br></p><p>She breathed heavily and controlled her anger before looking at them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Very well. I will pass this on to Michael.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you, Lady Ariel.”</p><p><br></p><p>She hesitated a moment before looking at him. “May I…?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes?”</p><p><br></p><p>“May I touch the Spear once?” She spoke after steeling herself more.</p><p><br></p><p>He took a moment to realise her words and then he passed on the spear to her with a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>She accepted it with slightly shivering hands as her eyes teared up.</p><p><br></p><p>‘I see. So this is why he sent me here.’ The realisation finally came to Sean.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Michael -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the letter in his hands in great contemplation.</p><p><br></p><p>Helel calling for a meeting of the leaders of the Three Factions?</p><p><br></p><p>He had found out about what had happened in the Underworld almost instantly due to the sheer scale of the thing.</p><p><br></p><p>The Devil Net was both a wonderful tool as well as a curse when it came to information regulation.</p><p><br></p><p>To think Lilith was still alive.</p><p><br></p><p>He could only imagine the fury of his brother at seeing Lilith in such a condition.</p><p><br></p><p>And to make matters worse, Rizevim of all people was trying to retrieve her body.</p><p><br></p><p>Knowing Helel, he had alerted Heaven to be ready for a possible war if things escalated. The show of power by him and his subordinates had only served to increase his fears but , in the end, his brother had surprised him once more.</p><p><br></p><p>The fact that he was here reading a letter and not preparing for a war was already evidence enough of the extent to which his twin brother had changed.</p><p><br></p><p>On the very same day Sirzechs had called him to ask about his identity.</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t reveal anything directly but he knew that his former identity would assist Damien in his work there so he gave Sirzechs a hint.</p><p><br></p><p>The new Satan was smart and caught on to his words.</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully, things were resolved peacefully… well, as peacefully as they get done in the Devil Society.</p><p><br></p><p>He sent Ariel to keep an eye on the Church so that they don’t do anything foolish at such a sensitive time.</p><p><br></p><p>And he was right in doing so because, the next morning, one of his subordinates, the reincarnation of the Irish Demigod and the son of Lugh had appeared outside the Vatican and passed on a letter to Ariel, who was stationed there.</p><p><br></p><p>It had caused quite a ruckus in the Vatican when a man walked directly to the main church with the True Longinus in his hands.</p><p><br></p><p>The entire upper echelon of the Church had gathered. Thankfully Vasco Strada had recognised him from the bar and hurried forward, diffusing the situation before it spiralled out of control.</p><p><br></p><p>Ariel was informed almost immediately and she went ahead to meet him only to receive the letter.</p><p><br></p><p>She had been quite emotional when she had handed him the letter.</p><p><br></p><p>He could imagine the reason for it though.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the letter once more.</p><p><br></p><p>“What will you be doing, Michael?” Raphael asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Another Great War… There is no way such a thing can be allowed. It was Father’s last wish. I will go and attend the meeting. Talk to Azazel and Serafall. Inform them that we will be attending the meeting as well.” He ordered Gabriel.</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Who will be accompanying you to the meeting?” Raphael asked.</p><p><br></p><p>He thought for a moment and then looked at Uriel, who seemed a bit lost. All of them understood his intentions and nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>It was about time he cleared the misunderstandings with Celine as well.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Satanael -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He was alive.</p><p><br></p><p>Lucifer… was alive.</p><p><br></p><p>A chill ran down his spine as he tried to imagine the time when he had fought him in the Great War.</p><p><br></p><p>He hadn’t lasted moments and had to be rescued by Father.</p><p><br></p><p>Back then he had understood one thing with certainty.</p><p><br></p><p>Apart from Father and Michael, there was no one in the Three Factions who could fight him off.</p><p><br></p><p>That realisation made him experience a feeling of powerlessness which had carried on till this day.</p><p><br></p><p>The apathetic look in his eyes as he defeated him and stood towering over his injured body. There was now way he could forget that.</p><p><br></p><p>It was something which still haunted his dreams.</p><p><br></p><p>Lucifer was on a level which normal angels, even Seraphs couldn’t hope to ever match.</p><p><br></p><p>He was created that way.</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, it wasn’t anything strange. He was always Father’s favourite.</p><p><br></p><p>And see where that led him to.</p><p><br></p><p>But on that day, he understood another thing.</p><p><br></p><p>There was no way he could ever hope to match someone like Lucifer no matter how much effort he put into it.</p><p><br></p><p>He needed something more.</p><p><br></p><p>He needed help.</p><p><br></p><p>And what else was better than the tools made to kill Gods and Satans alike.</p><p><br></p><p>The Sacred Gears, specifically the Longinus.</p><p><br></p><p>The greatest creations of their Father.</p><p><br></p><p>They held a key to make him surpass his limits and reach a level where he could finally get rid of these nightmares.</p><p><br></p><p>His pursuit was however not taken in good light by their Father and… he fell. He was cast out of Heaven and he could still remember the look of disappointment on Father’s face.</p><p><br></p><p>Father had said that he was disappointed that he wouldn’t be able to control his envy before casting him out of Heaven.</p><p><br></p><p>How?</p><p><br></p><p>How was that his fault?</p><p><br></p><p>He wouldn’t have fallen if he was made the same as Lucifer.</p><p><br></p><p>But no.</p><p><br></p><p>He wasn’t allowed that privilege and when he tried to obtain it for himself… this was the result.</p><p><br></p><p>That day, he had sworn that he would surpass Lucifer and he would be the one to kill him to show Father that he had made the wrong choice.</p><p><br></p><p>But even that was taken away from him when he died along with Father and his fellow Satans.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, he still didn’t stop his research.</p><p><br></p><p>And once more, Azazel had taken it upon himself to oppose him.</p><p><br></p><p>But it seems now he finally has a chance once more.</p><p><br></p><p>He will prove it to everyone that he was correct and show them that he is also someone who could defeat Father’s favourite.</p><p><br></p><p>He clenched his fingers as he looked at the lab in front of him.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. He would do that for sure, this time.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked in front of himself.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>With this, he will surely be able to overcome the gap.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Rizevim -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“And what makes you think I will trust or even be interested in something you would propose?” The being in front of him said in a hollow voice.</p><p><br></p><p>“You might not trust me but you will definitely be interested in what I want.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! And what exactly do you want?”</p><p><br></p><p>“A war. I wish for a war between the Three Factions. One that unlike the Great War won’t just stop at the death of their leaders but will engulf it till none of them is left. You on the other hand will not only be able to get rid of all the annoyances from the Underworld and get a better share over the Underworld but also be able to get the Abrahamic Souls which will have nowhere to go to after Heaven is destroyed. With the new influx of souls, you can surely rise beyond the combined powers of your brothers.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hold your tongue, Devil. Do not go to places which you shouldn’t. Do you think I’m afraid of those two buffoons? Or even those abominations who currently call themselves Satans? Do you think your words will provoke me into starting a war to clean up after you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I never said you did.” he rolled his eyes before replying. “But you won’t mind them being wiped out anyways. Especially since my Father is back now. And you will never be starting any war. I have more than enough means to wipe out all Three factions. All you need to do is to back me up.” He smiled as he then went forward and explained his plans.</p><p><br></p><p>To think Damien was hiding such a secret.</p><p><br></p><p>He had laughed the entire day at the revelation.</p><p><br></p><p>A Reincarnation.</p><p><br></p><p>And a reincarnation of Father.</p><p><br></p><p>Project Genesis had created something more than he was expecting.</p><p><br></p><p>Something he had only dreamed of but never knew he could achieve.</p><p><br></p><p>A chance to play a game against his father, at his best.</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>Not his best.</p><p><br></p><p>He was beyond his best.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the advantage of power which he had over him previously was gone.</p><p><br></p><p>This time, the stakes were real… and he loved every moment of it.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why he needed to put in just that much effort to win.</p><p><br></p><p>Father had somehow raised some servants who were able to collectively hold him back or even finish him off.</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t know how but as expected of the one man he had looked up to.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, this version of Father was… a bit new.</p><p><br></p><p>Probably hadn’t assimilated all his memories yet.</p><p><br></p><p>So, he needed to take his time and prepare.</p><p><br></p><p>Or he might just end up like poor Zekram.</p><p><br></p><p>The fool who thought that just because he was given the Rank of Great King, he was the actual King of the Underworld.</p><p><br></p><p>He had no idea that the Sleeping Sickness was artificial or he would have torn him apart the moment he had retrieved his Mother.</p><p><br></p><p>But Father played the whole Underworld on the palm of his hands.</p><p><br></p><p>To think he would have spies in his own lab to be able to pull something like that off.</p><p><br></p><p>There was no shred of doubt in his mind about his identity.</p><p><br></p><p>It proved that although he didn’t have all his memories, he still had the mind of ‘The Devil’.</p><p><br></p><p>And to play against the Devil for his title, he couldn’t afford to slack off.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is only the first part of the plan.” he explained to the being in front of him.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Venelana -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She finally retired for the day.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you alright?” Zeo asked again. He had been overly worried about her since… since that incident.</p><p><br></p><p>Rebirth.</p><p><br></p><p>Even now, it was strange to think about it.</p><p><br></p><p>Back then, her mind was still in a state of confusion and she couldn’t understand what was happening so she wasn’t able to thank him properly but hearing what he had done… how he had saved her family from breaking apart. She was thankful to the creator of their race.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I was just thinking of the thing Merlin had told us this morning.”</p><p><br></p><p>“About praying to him?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded in agreement. “I keep recalling that.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t remember him ever having that power before… then again, this version of Lucifer is a lot different from what we knew of him. What do you think?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well… there is only one way to know.” She closed her eyes and held her hands together… and for the first time in her life, she did something which she didn’t think she would ever do.</p><p><br></p><p>She prayed.</p><p><br></p><p>______________________________________x_________________________________________________________________________________x___________________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Finally, the Project Regicide Arc is completed.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Zekram is dead.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Everyone knows about Damien being alive and reincarnated.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>We will be entering the next arc soon.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I will be taking a month to plan the new arc and return back to my usual schedule for one chapter every alternate week for this story after that.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>It will also help me refresh my mind.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Things are finally becoming interesting.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Other factions and Pantheons will be joining the fray as ‘The Devil’ is revealed.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>What happens next… we will have to wait and see.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enjoy the next chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>",

The Old Satan faction is moving.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the figure on the screen once more… and then ordered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Prepare everyone Merlin. Today, the Underworld… will see the Devil once more.”</p><p><br></p><p>And Zekram Bael will regret the day he put his hands on Lilith.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Sirzechs -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He watched the screen in frozen shock. He was pretty sure that everyone was the same at this time.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone had forgotten why they had gathered there and what the situation truly was. Even the ones who had entered the place to attack were the same.</p><p><br></p><p>Lilith.</p><p><br></p><p>She was alive?</p><p><br></p><p>And with Zekram?</p><p><br></p><p>The condition in which she was however didn’t present a good picture.</p><p><br></p><p>Lilith was the mother of Devilkind.</p><p><br></p><p>Her position was comparable to the original Satans, even greater than the other three and comparable to Lucifer himself.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a reason why they had named their capital city as New Lilith as a show of respect for her.</p><p><br></p><p>While it was true that only two of the devils created by Lilith and Lucifer were still alive, it was not completely true.</p><p><br></p><p>It was only true for Pillar Devils.</p><p><br></p><p>There were still the others.</p><p><br></p><p>A decent number of Mid and Low Class Devils were first generation Devils created by Lilith.</p><p><br></p><p>They were all in high positions and held a lot of important posts and an immense amount of influence in the Underworld due to their age and contribution to Devilkind.</p><p><br></p><p>And this was not even including those who had directly fought under them were still completely loyal to them. There were also the hardcore loyalists of the Old Satan faction. All of these people would move all at once at this news.</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>They were probably already moving.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally there was the Lucifer House itself.</p><p><br></p><p>Rizevim… and him.</p><p><br></p><p>Even he felt his heart sink at the thought. It was hard to even imagine the severity of the mess.</p><p><br></p><p>But first things first. “Souji, take the entire Peerage to the Bael territory. Set up a blockage around the place and evacuate everyone. Take the members of the Bael Branch House into protection and for questioning. Grayfia, send people to the Bael territory to calm down the people and stop riots from happening.”</p><p><br></p><p>Even his mother was trapped among the people of the Bael House. He couldn’t lose his cool right now.</p><p><br></p><p>His orders shook many people from their reverie and pushed them all into action.</p><p><br></p><p>Falbium mobilised the forces and Ajuka took control of the digital network.</p><p><br></p><p>Serafall was left to guard Zekram to prevent the matter from going south because he was pretty sure there would be too many who would be coming after his head.</p><p><br></p><p>While this was happening, the attackers had moved too. They scoured the room where Lilith was being held and it was revealed that she was under the Sleeping Sickness and his heart sank even more… if that was even possible.</p><p><br></p><p>In the next fifteen minutes, the fact that Zekram Bael was responsible for the creation of the Sleeping sickness and everything related to it was revealed.</p><p><br></p><p>The news of tension in several parts of the Underworld had already started.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sirzechs, I think you should give a public statement.” His father stated. “If the matters are left till the investigations are done, it would be very late. Everything will just get harder the longer we wait.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t think that would be wise.” A voice interrupted them.</p><p><br></p><p>Looking at the speaker, it turned out to be Archduke Agares.</p><p><br></p><p>“What do you mean by that Lord Agares?” He asked, confused.</p><p><br></p><p>“First of all understand that I am not blaming you for anything but look at this from an outsider’s perspective. This incident will question the credibility of the Satans. And especially you due to your connection to Zekram Bael.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you insinuating?” he asked, narrowing his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>The old Lord let out a sigh. “Sirzechs. Please see it like this. You were supported as the Lucifer not only due to your personal strength and contribution in the War but also due to your connection with Zekram. This is a fact that no one can decline. Even your own power of destruction is the Clan Trait of the Bael from your mother, who is also present at the scene. No matter what you say, people will always remember this.” Lord Agares explained. “If today, you were to get involved in this investigation and they are found innocent, some might raise questions about the veracity of the investigation.”</p><p><br></p><p>He clenched his fist but listened because the point he was raising was a fact.</p><p><br></p><p>“We need good leaders like you four. Especially in a rough time like this. But please understand, this is a place where one wrong move will lead to a political suicide. Lilith… is a name none of us can compare to… and I will be honest. With the information that has been revealed, it is more or less sure that Zekram is going to fall. I just want you to not get dragged into it. Let any of the other Satans handle it. You should go and suppress the riots instead. Make a public statement and then control the public.”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the man and then to the other heads of the Houses. Looking at their gazes was a good enough answer.</p><p><br></p><p>His grandmother was the next in line to speak. “Lord Agares speaks quite reasonably. This matter is no longer something which can be taken lightly.I will go and awaken her too. At such a time, we need all the help we can get. If we try to solve this by strength, too many people will revolt. We are going to have too much on our hands as it is. You should concentrate on maintaining the peace of the Underworld.”</p><p><br></p><p>He took a deep breath.</p><p><br></p><p>“Very well. Serafall will take care of the investigation. She won’t let any crime go unpunished. I will give a public statement, pulling out of this matter.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Chysis Gremory -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She let out a sigh as Sirzehcs left, heavily dissatisfied. She couldn’t blame him for it. After toiling so hard for the Underworld, to hear such a thing, could be depressing for anyone.</p><p><br></p><p>But they had no choice.</p><p><br></p><p>At this point it was sure that Zekram and the Bael House would fall. With all the information which was found in the room and provided, there was hardly any room for second guesses. But Lilith’s appearance alone made this matter beyond complicated for them anyways.</p><p><br></p><p>What Agares said was not wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>In such a time, if Sirzechs were to get involved, it would lead to a massive political scandal, despite his good intentions.</p><p><br></p><p>At such a time, voluntarily backing away and giving the charge of the investigation to someone else will clear the doubts of many as well as gain him the sympathy of some.</p><p><br></p><p>The Bael House was going to fall. She didn’t want the rubble to harm the Gremorys. Although, she wasn’t sure she could do all that by herself anymore.</p><p><br></p><p>For something of this level, she needed to awaken her to personally appear and try to quell the matter.</p><p><br></p><p>The only thing she could pray for was that this doesn’t result in a war.</p><p><br></p><p>“Where are you going Mother?” Zeoticus asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“To get help.”</p><p><br><br><br></p><p><strong>- Alicia Sallos -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“There is an emergency conference of the Satans.” One of her subordinates informed her.</p><p><br></p><p>As expected. They do need to make a statement. No matter how useless it would be in such a scenario.</p><p><br></p><p>It was all taken into consideration when making the plan.</p><p><br></p><p>“What do we do, my Lady?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Nothing. We watch and we show the members of the Bael House what is being said. Tell me about the situation of the Underworld.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Our people have started working in different parts of the Underworld. Gathering people who had resentment against the current way of things was not hard. As soon as the Satans get busy, we can start the next phase of the plan.”</p><p><br></p><p>This was the first major operation they had in the Underworld. Every detail was thought about and they ran several simulations to make sure it doesn’t go awry.</p><p><br></p><p>They had to balance everything so that the Underworld suffers the least amount of damage or it would be complete antithesis to their original goal.</p><p><br></p><p>Ophelia was currently among the Lords who were pressuring the Satans and sending the information about the situation there to Damien.</p><p><br></p><p>The conference started in fifteen minutes and she made sure that the broadcast was shown to even the captives.</p><p><br></p><p>According to Ophelia, Sirzechs would be backing away from the investigation personally and Serafall Leviathan, who is currently beyond pissed at Zekram, will be taking control of the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>What reaction will the Bael House have about this?</p><p><br>Will they break and reveal some more of their buried skeletons?</p><p><br></p><p>Their expressions were interesting to say the least.</p><p><br></p><p>Lord Bael looked like he had seen a ghost. He went from cussing and enraged to quiet and in shock.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you ever think that you all would face this situation someday when you were suppressing and killing the members of other houses, driving them into extinction and smearing their names with mud?”</p><p><br></p><p>It was a bit cathartic to see them kneeling like this.</p><p><br></p><p>She had faced a lot of problems from their faction when she had ascended to her position too. Her House had to struggle to obtain a fair deal in any place due to the suppression of the Great King faction because she hadn’t accepted to be a part of that faction.</p><p><br></p><p>They had first tried to have one of their people marry her and ascend to the position of the Lord of her house.</p><p><br></p><p>She had downright rejected it.</p><p><br></p><p>This had led to the eventual suppression.They refused to do business with her even when her house asked for the least amount of margins.</p><p><br></p><p>It was only her Clan Tait which helped her escape the eventual attack of the Sleeping sickness.</p><p><br></p><p>Her Father was not so lucky though.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, she had to shift her business to the Human World and gain a foothold to support her house. Unlike most of the Houses, she had maintained a good hold over several businesses in the Human world and this money translated back to the Underworld currency.</p><p><br></p><p>It took her over a century and making deals with the Archduke Agares faction to finally be able to return back to the Underworld and establish a business here.</p><p><br></p><p>From there, she had stepped foot into the entertainment industry and established herself as the foremost actress in the Underworld.</p><p><br></p><p>She managed to make investments guided by her Power of Insight and in four hundred years, she was able to stand firm in the Underworld.</p><p><br></p><p>When she was marked by Damien, she found out the truth about the Sleeping Sickness and how they had attempted to attack her family.</p><p><br></p><p>It was one of the main reasons why she personally asked to be assigned to this position for this mission.</p><p><br></p><p>She wanted to see them suffer as well.</p><p><br></p><p>“My Lady, the barrier has been surrounded by the forces of the Satans. They are not attacking us but they are not leaving either. And we have received information that the Old Satan faction is moving too.” Victoria said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is that so? Very well. Let us move. Just render the ones inside unconscious temporarily when we leave.”</p><p><br></p><p>And just like that, they moved to one of the empty rooms which had been emptied beforehand and Gretel who was hiding all this time transported them all away with her Dimension Lost.</p><p><br></p><p>The same thing was done in the other places that they had taken control of.</p><p><br></p><p>Without anyone powering the barriers, the devices will self-destruct in fifteen minutes which was more than enough time for them to disappear.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Serafall -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She was outside the Bael House which still lay under the barriers.</p><p><br></p><p>Those darned barriers which just refused to break no matter what.</p><p><br></p><p>It was all Zekram’s fault.</p><p><br></p><p>Not just Sona getting captured but also this entire mess.</p><p><br></p><p>Lilith.</p><p><br></p><p>He had kept Lilith captured under the Sleeping Sickness.</p><p><br></p><p>That insane bastard.</p><p><br>Did he not know what kind of mess it would be if he ever got discovered. The Lucifer House, the Old Satan faction, even the entire underworld and not to mention that scary new Lucifer who ran the bar along with his subordinates…</p><p><br></p><p>There were far easier ways to commit suicide than this.</p><p><br></p><p>She wasn’t even sure what kind of punishment they could sentence someone to for that kind of crime.</p><p><br></p><p>Because she was sure if it didn’t satisfy everyone, things would get chaotic very soon.</p><p><br></p><p>Not that it won’t get chaotic.</p><p><br></p><p>While she didn’t like it that Sirzechs was told to leave the investigation to others, she understood the need for it and also somewhere in her heart, she was a bit pleased that she will get to dig out each and every bit of information from the Bael Family, by any means necessary.</p><p><br></p><p>The only reason she was even working at such a time was because the attackers hadn’t shown any kind of violence towards the hostages and that Sona was under the protection of Helena and Charlene.</p><p><br></p><p>Even she was surprised by the power shown by those two. They seemed to be at least a Satan Class being from the brief display of their power.</p><p><br></p><p>Right now everyone was tense as the video feed for all the locations were cut off. No one had any idea about what was happening inside.</p><p><br></p><p>Just as she was thinking about what to do, the barrier to the place dropped.</p><p><br></p><p>What?</p><p><br></p><p>Were they testing her?</p><p><br></p><p>Or was this just a bait?</p><p><br></p><p>Right at this moment, she received a call from Ajuka who was coordinating everything. Barriers had fallen everywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>The hostages were safe.</p><p><br></p><p>“Behemoth.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, my Lady.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The barriers have fallen at other locations too. You go ahead and pick Sona up. Bring her back home with Mother.”</p><p><br></p><p>“As you command.”</p><p><br></p><p>He left instantly and she commanded others.</p><p><br></p><p>“Set up a perimeter around the place. Let no one in or out without my permission.” For the rest of her peerage she ordered. “Get in. Our first job is to secure Lilith and Venelana Gremory. Then collect the proof of the crimes. Make sure you don’t leave anything behind.”</p><p><br></p><p>With the orders in place, she led the attack herself.</p><p><br></p><p>But what met her inside first was something else entirely.</p><p><br></p><p>“Lord Bael, please cooperate with us. We don’t mean any harm to you. If you had nothing to do with this, you will be safe. I promise this to you in the name of the four Great Satans.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha do you think I’m a fool, girl? The Bael house is done for. After that accursed broadcast everything is over. If you all really mean no harm, then why isn’t Sirzechs here? You have all given up on us because you just want a convenient scapegoat to slaughter. But I will not go down so easily!” He roared.</p><p><br></p><p>She prepared to attack but stopped at the sight in front of her.</p><p><br></p><p>The gate behind him opened and there, Venelana Gremory lay captive by the Peerage members of Lord Bael.</p><p><br></p><p>She stopped her move immediately. “Don’t be foolish, Lord Bael. This will only make your position worse.”</p><p><br>“Shut up! That bastard has everything because of the Bael House. His position, his name, his power Everything! And yet, he betrayed us at the first sign of trouble. Does he think he can leave that easily as we burn? Do you all think you can betray the Great King and be happy? I will not allow that!”</p><p><br></p><p>He gathered the Power of Destruction in his hands but Serafall was faster. Before he could attack, she had already frozen his limbs completely.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the peerage members were unable to do anything.</p><p><br></p><p>She took the advantage of their surprise as she attacked, freezing them before they could do anything.</p><p><br></p><p>Her peerage members rushed to recover Lady Gremory.</p><p><br></p><p>She quickly picked her up but felt something odd.</p><p><br></p><p>Her body felt heavy somehow.</p><p><br></p><p>A pit formed in her stomach as she quickly checked her for signs of life only to hear a crackle behind her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ahahahaha, I knew it! I knew this would happen. Do you fools think you have won? Hahahaha I already poisoned her before bringing her out! She was already dead, hahahaha! The property of the Bael will go down with the Bael!”</p><p><br></p><p>She threw a spell at him, knocking him out.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Go and check if Lilith is alright.” She ordered her peerage members as she held Venelana’s body in her arms.</p><p><br></p><p>Several spells all gave the same result. Venelana Gremory was truly gone.</p><p><br></p><p>And she had thought things couldn’t get any worse.</p><p><br></p><p>When Sirzechs finds out, he’ll…</p><p><br></p><p>Thus she called the only person who could keep him in control at such a time.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ajuka… we have a problem.”</p><p><br></p><p>She ended the call and waited for them to arrive while she moved Venelana’s body into a different room to hide her death from others.</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully, there was a barrier around Lilith’s body. Those bastards had made sure that the barrier would break only after an hour.</p><p><br></p><p>She couldn’t even imagine the amount of shit they would be in if that madman had accidentally killed Lilith in his madness.</p><p><br></p><p>One by one, the Lords of other Houses be it Pillars or Extra Demons started appearing.</p><p><br></p><p>Falbium was the first to arrive as he was nearby.</p><p><br></p><p>The only ones left were Ajuka and the Gremorys.</p><p><br></p><p>\"What happened, Serafall? How is the situation of the hostages?\" He questioned. She merely shook her head in negative.</p><p><br></p><p>He frowned. \"Did they take Lilith? If so then…\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Lady Gremory is dead.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"... what?\" His words stopped in between, not realising the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Lord Bael. He killed her before the barriers fell.\"</p><p><br></p><p>She quickly led him to the place where her body was kept.</p><p><br></p><p>Falbium checked her body before getting up and looking at her.</p><p><br></p><p>\"How?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"She had already died before the barriers fell. Lord Bael admitted to the crime. I left him alive for interrogation.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Sirzechs is out clearing the riots. He will…\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I have already sent a message to Ajuka. He will inform Lord Gremory about it.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"What about Lilith?\"</p><p><br></p><p>He asked when he finally collected himself.</p><p><br></p><p>\"She is fine. The attackers made a barrier around her before they left. It will last for an hour or so.\"</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay. I will order the area to be surrounded. Other Lords will be coming here soon. See that they don’t cause any trouble at such a time. I have sent for Charlene to help us to back us up.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright.”</p><p><br></p><p>But as if the whole world was turning on them.</p><p><br></p><p>Falbium's peerage member came in running. \"My Lord, we have a problem.\"</p><p><br></p><p>They rushed outside at the message and sure enough a while later a magic circle appeared but to her misfortune, it was not the one she was hoping to see.</p><p><br></p><p>The silver magic circle disappeared and out of it came two people and as if a signal was given, one after another magic circles started appearing above the sky.</p><p><br></p><p>The Old Satan faction had come.</p><p><br></p><p>Leading the group was the monster whom they were taught since childhood to avoid.</p><p><br></p><p>Rizevim Livan Lucifer.</p><p><br></p><p>Behind him were the other Satan descendants.</p><p><br></p><p>The area already had a few other Pillar Lords but at such a time none of them stepped forward to face the monster.</p><p><br></p><p>“If they take Lilith…” Falbium whispered.</p><p><br></p><p>“And what can we do in this case? Stop them? They have every right to take her away. Especially after the whole debacle. No matter their stance, she is still his mother, a member of her family.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But he… killed Lucifer. There is a chance that…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t you think I know that? But what else can we do?”</p><p><br></p><p>It was like being stuck between a rock and a hard place.</p><p><br></p><p>No matter what they do, they will be screwed.</p><p><br></p><p>Why the fuck did Zekram have to do something like that?</p><p><br></p><p>“Uyahahaha little Sitri and Glasya-Labolas. Two of the little Satans are here guarding my mum. Is she well? I heard that a few kids were up for some mischief and watched the fun. Imagine my surprise when the comedy show turned into this. To think mum was alive all this time and just taking a nap. Zekram has been quite naughty.” His words were casual but and all the time, he smiled but the power he was radiating made it anything but a greeting. “Say… did you guys know about this?”</p><p><br></p><p>“We had no idea about any such thing.” Falbium spoke, trying to clear the misunderstanding before anything.</p><p><br></p><p>“Liars! Do you think we would believe that? You pretenders, especially that abomination who dares call himself Lucifer is related to that traitor Zekram. And you say they had nothing to do with it.” A man beside him shouted. It took her a moment to realise who that was.</p><p><br></p><p>Euclid Lucifuge.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked completely different from before. She couldn’t even recognise him for a moment.</p><p><br></p><p>“Zekram Bael is being investigated for his crimes. Sirzechs has voluntarily given up the investigation to other Satans and abstained from taking part in it. We will give you a proper answer when the investigation is concluded.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We don’t want any fake investigation that you can just use to wipe out their crimes. We want him to pay for his crimes.” He shouted.</p><p><br></p><p>By this time several Pillar Devils had gathered in the place. The fact that they stayed at a distance and didn’t intervene, just watching everything from a distance didn’t help either.</p><p><br></p><p>“Now now Euclid. All that will come later. First, let’s get my mum back. I have been missing her a lot.” He turned towards her and asked. “Where is she?”</p><p><br></p><p>Although it seemed like a harmless question, she knew that it was nothing of the sort. The worst part was that she couldn’t resist even if she wanted to. Because she had no reason to.</p><p><br></p><p>What he was asking for was nothing strange.</p><p><br></p><p>She let out a breath. “She is inside. There is still a barrier around her. I will lead you there.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Go on then.”</p><p><br></p><p>She led them towards the barrier, praying in her mind that Ajuka would come as fast as possible. If things got worse, she didn’t think she could manage things just between her and Falbium considering they might have those strange artifacts Sirzechs had spoken of before.</p><p><br></p><p>Falbium stayed behind to monitor the rest of the Old Satan faction.</p><p><br></p><p>A few minutes later, they were at the barrier. Thankfully it was still holding on.</p><p><br></p><p>Now she only wished it held on till the backup came. Strange how in just a matter of half an hour, she went from wanting nothing from wanting the damned barrier to disappear to wanting it to stay.</p><p><br></p><p>“Go on, remove the barrier.” he asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I’m sorry, Lord Rizevim but we cannot remove the barrier. It was put there by the attackers.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p><br></p><p>He walked up to the barrier and a massive amount of power burst out from him. He conjured a spell which made her feel that she would be downright erased if she were to get hit by it directly.</p><p><br></p><p>She quickly made a barrier of her own.</p><p><br></p><p>He attacked the barrier. The whole dimension where the room was shook. Her barrier cracked even when not being attacked directly. The surroundings were crushed.</p><p><br></p><p>As the dust settled, she looked and saw the barrier around Lilith to be as it was, completely undamaged.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well what do you know, you were telling the truth. I guess we’ll have to wait then.” He laughed, conjuring a chair in front of the barrier as he took a seat there.</p><p><br></p><p>She let out a sigh of relief.</p><p><br></p><p>Time passed.</p><p><br></p><p>Each second seemed as if it was an hour.</p><p><br></p><p>Around fifteen minutes later, she felt another aura rising outside the dimension.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs.</p><p><br></p><p>It attracted attention too and a look of hatred appeared on Euclid’s face.</p><p><br></p><p>Did he?</p><p><br></p><p>The aura however calmed down soon.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. He must have found out about Venelana.</p><p><br></p><p>Sure enough.</p><p><br></p><p>In just a minute, the members of Sirzechs’ peerage came in as backup. Even Ajuka’s followed behind them.</p><p><br></p><p>She finally felt an invisible load lift from her shoulder.</p><p><br></p><p>“Serafall.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am fine.” She quickly stopped them from doing anything stupid. “Sirzechs?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Lord Gremory and Falbium are there.”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>The atmosphere in the room just became more tense with Ajuka's presence.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe encouraged by Ajuka’s presence, several other House Heads also entered the place but maintained a distance to watch the show safely.</p><p><br></p><p>Time ticked by.</p><p><br></p><p>An hour later, as expected, the barriers came down.</p><p><br></p><p>Rizevim got up from his seat and walked towards Lilith. She tried to interrupt but Ajuka stopped her from interfering and she realised what she was doing.</p><p><br></p><p>Ajuka however intervened. “We would like to check Lady Lilith for some verifications. There is still a chance that she could be a fake planted by the attackers.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Preposterous. Do you want to cover for that abomination too?” Euclid roared.</p><p><br></p><p>Rizevim also paused and looked at Ajuka with a smile and she had a very bad feeling about it. “Go on. I will give you a minute. And no matter the result, I will take her with me. After all, there is only so much I can agree to after the grave negligence from your side. To think my poor mother was trapped in this place for such a long time. I want to take her home as soon as possible.”</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s when she realised that they were trapped. He wanted them to check and verify her in front of everyone to cause even more chaos.</p><p><br></p><p>Ajuka however was completely unphased by them and quickly scanned the entire place.</p><p><br></p><p>“She is suffering from the sleeping disease but there is nothing else wrong with her. She is… Lady Lilith.”</p><p><br></p><p>\"Awesome. Then I will be taking her.\" Rizevim gleefully clapped his hands and then he turned towards Ajuka. \"Oh… and I will be coming back for Zekram. I don't care what you people investigate or find. <em>I</em> will be the one to deliver the final judgement.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"If he is found guilty. There will be a public sentence.\" Ajuka replied, not backing down.</p><p><br></p><p>\"What?\" Rizevim questioned, narrowing his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Lady Lilith is a member of your family so I will not intervene if you take her but the sentence of Zekram Bael will be carried out in accordance with the laws of the Underworld.”</p><p><br></p><p>They stared off with each other till Rizevim began to laugh.</p><p><br></p><p>\"You can dream whatever you'd like to dream.\"</p><p><br></p><p>With his words said, he turned towards the case where Lilith was being kept and reached out to pick her up… only for someone to hold his wrist and slowly push it aside.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked up to see a guy with silver hair and blue eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Damien Lucifer Asmodeus.</p><p><br></p><p>Behind him were the same faces she had seen a few hours ago.</p><p><br></p><p>Merlin Ambrosius, Ingvild Leviathan as well as several other faces which she had no idea about.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Rizevim was taken aback at his appearance and didn’t react when he moved towards the case and picked Lilith up in his arms.</p><p><br></p><p>Then he turned his head back to look at Rizevim and Serafall found herself frozen at the coldness in those eyes. He didn’t look even remotely similar to the person they had met two hours ago.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Damien -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I was ready to leave the bar with my team to go to the underworld, when I sensed a pair of guests arriving at my door steps.</p><p><br></p><p>Musashi relayed that they wanted to talk to meet me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Bring them in.”</p><p><br></p><p>Soon, two figures walked in.</p><p><br></p><p>“I would have thought that you would visit the Bael Mansion instead of this place? After all, that’s the place which needs you more… Runeas Gremory.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oho little Chysis was correct. You do look like him. Almost so much that even I was fooled.” The twin tailed Devil stared at me, looking smug.</p><p><br></p><p>She was always like this. I have several memories regarding her too.</p><p><br></p><p>But at this moment, her gaze was kinda annoying me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Damien… we have come here… to ask for your help.” Chysis opened the conversation.</p><p><br></p><p>I just looked at her unmovingly.</p><p><br></p><p>Merlin took care of the conversation instead.</p><p><br></p><p>“And what help would that be? We have already stated that we want no part in the mess of the Underworld.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You are…” Runeas looked at Merlin slightly confused.</p><p><br></p><p>“Merlin Ambrosius.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh… yes. Now that I look closer, you do seem a little familiar.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I would say it’s a pleasure to meet you, maybe even invite you for a drink and talk about old days but I believe this is not a time for that. Can we leave aside the reminiscence for now? Why exactly are you here? If you want our help, I have already stated what our opinion is regarding the matter. Damien has also done the same when he met Sirzechs.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The Devil race was created by Lucifer. Can you just sit aside and watch what is happening today?” Chysis questioned.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sit aside? No. We were in fact going there to bring back Lilith. Apart from that, what does it matter to us what happens to the Devil race? Not to mention, don’t you think you are being too presumptuous to think that only the Devils living in the Underworld constitute the whole Devil Race?”</p><p><br></p><p>“But they do constitute a majority.” She looked at me. “Please. You are the only one who can stop this whole mess.”</p><p><br></p><p>Runeas took the opportunity to throw her two words in. “Alright, let’s get down to it. What do you want in return? You already have a pretty good team here but joining with the Underworld can provide them a stronger backing. With your blood and face, you can easily become the Satan Lucifer and no one would question it, especially with me backing you up. Aside from you, even the Leviathan girl and Merlin establish the Satan clans once more. Evil Pieces can take care of their Human Side. Quite a convenient piece of invention. So many things happened while I was asleep…”</p><p><br></p><p>I stopped her from her rant with a raised hand. “Before anything, tell me something. This Sleeping sickness… did you know that Zekram had used this on Lilith?”</p><p><br></p><p>This is something I needed to know. My information was only about Zekram but I didn’t know anything about her being involved or anyone else for that matter.”</p><p><br></p><p>Her face took on a serious expression. “I had no idea she was even alive, let alone under the Sleeping sickness.” She replied quite sincerely.</p><p><br></p><p>No lies.</p><p><br></p><p>Well then, I had nothing to say about this anymore.</p><p><br></p><p>Now to put her back in her place.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. I believe you. Now onto the second part. To promise me the position of a Satan Lucifer.” My smile grew feral as I channelled the side of Lucifer I had witnessed. “Who died and made you the king… little Runi?”</p><p><br></p><p>She almost recoiled at the sudden reply, taking back two steps in shock, her eyes wide open as her smug attitude disappeared.</p><p><br></p><p>“What did you…” She began but I interrupted.</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t remember you being so courageous when Leviathan had tied you up and hung you on top of the Pits for destroying her wine collection in your drunken brawl? Tell me, do you remember the first words said to you all when you were created?”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at me, muscles tense as her mouth opened but no words came out.</p><p><br></p><p>“I warned you all of something that day… and today one of you did just that.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Who are you?” She asked, shaken. I was talking about the day they were all created. Something only Lilith and Lucifer know apart from the original pillar devils.</p><p><br></p><p>My forces had gathered. Cleria had informed me just a moment ago so I too got up and left, her question answered.</p><p><br></p><p>One stunned and one confused devil were  left behind as I walked out of the room. At that moment a voice sounded in my mind.</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Damien. Can you hear me? Please… I need your help. Answer please.</em>” It was Rias’ voice. But unlike her usual shy and cheerful self, her voice was broken and filled with pain and sorrow. She’s crying.</p><p><br></p><p>“What happened Princess?” I questioned.</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Mother… she’s not breathing. She is not waking up. She is….please.</em>” Her voice choked.</p><p><br></p><p>I froze in my place, flashes of the past appearing in front of my eyes. My hands clenched at the painful memory.</p><p><br></p><p>“Where?” I forced myself to speak.</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>The Bael House. Damien… please… help me.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will be there soon.”</p><p><br></p><p>As soon as the connection was cut, I called Ophelia. “What happened to Venelana Gremory? I remember telling you that she should not be touched.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ophelia told me about the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>Lord Bael…</p><p><br></p><p>I clenched my teeth.</p><p><br></p><p>It was just like back then.</p><p><br></p><p>Due to my own foolishness….</p><p><br></p><p>Back then my sister was crying and this time it was my friend.</p><p><br></p><p>Back then it was Rizevim and this time Fucking Bael…</p><p><br></p><p>“Damien.” Merlin questioned seeing my sudden change in mood.</p><p><br></p><p>“Let’s go, Merlin. Today, we won't hold back.” I had to hold back the last time due to my own weakness as Vienna cried in my arms. I did everything I could to never be in that position ever again.</p><p><br></p><p>This time… screw holding back.</p><p><br></p><p>“As you order, my King.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Michael -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He watched as the whole place became quiet at the mention of the name.</p><p><br></p><p>Even after so long, Helel’s name could have such an effect inciting both good and bad memories in all the angels.</p><p><br></p><p>“What are you saying, brother?” Raphael asked, confused.</p><p><br></p><p>“I met Helel.” He repeated. “The mysterious angel who had appeared near the shroud was none other than our brother.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s impossible.”</p><p><br></p><p>“He is dead.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The Dead cannot come back.”</p><p><br></p><p>Several calls sounded in the room as Raphael became the voice of reason once more and calmed them down. This gave him a chance to explain things.</p><p><br></p><p>“He was the one who showed me the last moments of Father… and to prove his words, he held the True Longinus possessed by one of his subordinates. As we had already seen Father’s Blessing for him was stored inside the spear by him before passing. As soon as he held the spear, light enveloped him as his devil wings changed into twelve wings of pure silver colour. The aura he was giving, the power… it was unmistakably the same… Holy power.”</p><p><br></p><p>He explained everything that happened in the meeting and by the end of it everyone was completely silent.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why did he appear near the shroud?” Uriel asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“His soul is injured. Every time he touches one, his soul heals a bit and he….he believes that… if he can collect all the Five Holy Relics… he can gain an audience with Father’s spirit.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What!”</p><p><br></p><p>“He has already collected four out of five of them and only requires the Incinerate Anthem, which is in the possession of another one of our wayward brothers, Satanael.”</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone listened and he knew that he had to give orders now.</p><p><br></p><p>“What we need to do is try to find a clue about the Incinerate Anthem. He will not take any help from us, trying to solve everything on his own as a form of repentance but… we are family. And family helps each other. So, I request all of you, to please try to see if you can find any clues about the last Relic. If there is even a slight chance we can meet the spirit of Father…”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will deploy the spies to search for Satanael’s whereabouts.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The Church also has a good network. We have caught some people from the Fallen who had infiltrated the Church. We will try to make them speak.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Helel also gave me some information about the Heaven’s System. It seems some of our brothers and sisters are using loopholes in the System due to Father’s absence to escape falling.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s…”</p><p><br></p><p>“How many?” Uriel asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Quite a few. Fortunately, I was also given a method to reduce the loopholes. I will be working on it to get the system back to its previous condition. Till then, I request you all to keep the Church in check. We don’t want any war with his faction.”</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next few hours, they discussed the plans for the future.</p><p><br></p><p>When everything was done, the rest of the Seraphs left the place and the only ones left were the Great Seraphs, he looked at Uriel.</p><p><br></p><p>“In Helel’s bar… I met Celine.”</p><p><br></p><p>Uriel paused, his eyes widening slightly. Even Raphael and Gabriel looked at him in surprise. He continued. “She looked better than before. She sings there sometimes. You should go and visit sometimes.”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked lost at the reminder and absently nodded.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Zeoticus Gremory -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He lay on his knees beside his wife, looking at her cold lifeless body.</p><p><br></p><p>On his side, Sirzechs was in a similar situation. The only reason he was not in his true form, going on a rampage was because of Rias beside them.</p><p><br></p><p>As someone who had fought in wars and led people, both life and death are something they had come to accept a long time ago. He had seen several close relatives die in both the wars including his own father.</p><p><br></p><p>But this never got any easier.</p><p><br></p><p>To lose his life partner was the hardest.</p><p><br></p><p>To see his children crying in pain beside him was even harder than trying to stop himself from.</p><p><br></p><p>But someone has to hold themselves back to support the others.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs didn’t look like he was currently able to do so and Rias… she had been furiously praying…</p><p><br></p><p>He got up or rather forced himself to do so. “Let’s take her back home.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No!” Rias shouted. “It will be alright. Mother will be alright. We just need to wait here a bit.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Rias” he tried to make her understand but she just refused to listen.</p><p><br></p><p>Before he could say anything, someone entered the room quickly. “L… Lord Asmodeus, Lord Luc… Sirzechs… it’s… it is…” He looked like he had seen a ghost.</p><p><br></p><p>Falbium who had stayed behind to support Sirzechs questioned.</p><p><br></p><p>“There outside… it’s….it’s… Lucifer! It is Lucifer.”</p><p><br></p><p>Lucifer?</p><p><br></p><p>Oh!</p><p><br></p><p>It must be him.</p><p><br></p><p>So he came here too.</p><p><br></p><p>However, before he could say anything, Rias, who heard this, got up and ran outside. He followed to see a strange scene.</p><p><br></p><p>The entire place was eerily quiet.</p><p><br></p><p>Every Lord and Lady, every single devil from the Pillar Houses was looking at a figure in the middle of the hall with a wide eyed shocked look.</p><p><br></p><p>There were even some reporters.</p><p><br></p><p>Behind him was his entire entourage. Ones he had seen in the bar and the ones who were not there.</p><p><br></p><p>Merlin, Grayfia’s sister, the Leviathan girl, Cleine of the Holy Flames, there was even the infamous Kitsune, Akira as well as several under masks whom he didn’t recognise.</p><p><br></p><p>Over a dozen people followed closely behind him.</p><p><br></p><p>To his surprise, his daughter ran directly to him and hugged him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Please… help Mother.” She cried. “You said you are the Devil right? You can help my Mother then. Please… help us.”</p><p><br></p><p>The whole scene was attracting too much attention.</p><p><br></p><p>He let out a sigh as he walked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Rias. Please don’t disturb…”</p><p><br>His words however weren't completed when she took him by his hand and led him towards the room where Venelana’s body lay, passing by him without a word.</p><p><br></p><p>“Stop this, Rias. Venelana is…”</p><p><br></p><p>Damien turned back and looked at him, a finger on his lips, signalling him to be quiet.</p><p><br></p><p>He walked behind Rias and he followed. The other Lords looked at the scene and followed too.</p><p><br></p><p>Inside the room Sirzechs looked at them but didn’t do anything, too emotionally exhausted to even speak anything.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias looked at Damien and continued. “I… I will make a deal with you. If you help mother… I will give you anything you want for me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Rias!” He shouted.</p><p><br></p><p>The man in question however kneeled in front of Venelana, completely ignoring everything.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs narrowed his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Losing one’s mother is… extremely painful. I know it better than most. But… it’s not time for you to lose yours today.” He put a hand on Venelana’s head.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>“I… the bringer of Light and the Prince of Darkness….order you….live.”</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p>“What do you think you…”</p><p><br></p><p>Before Sirzechs could complete his words, light erupted from her body and lit the whole room up brightly.</p><p><br></p><p>What happened next made him forget his words completely.</p><p><br></p><p>Gasps rose around the room while Sirzechs, who looked like he was about to attack, completely froze in his place.</p><p><br></p><p>Several people in the room fell to their knees, heads bowed low, not even daring to look at the man.</p><p><br></p><p>But his eyes were only focused on the figure of Venelana which shook, her breath returning before she slowly opened her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>He walked forward, as if in a daze as she completely opened her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sirzechs. Rias. What is going on here?” She whispered softly.</p><p><br></p><p>Both the children hugged her and he too walked in to join wondering if all this was real or he was actually dreaming.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs looked up in shock and uttered only one word. “How?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I told you that I am the Devil… and that I do not lie. You all just didn’t want to believe it subconsciously.” He whispered back lightly.</p><p><br></p><p>And with his words said, he got up and began to leave.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs quickly got up and followed, catching up to him and bowing deeply in front of him. “I...have no words to convey my feelings right now.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then don’t. I didn’t do it for you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But you did us a favour I don’t think we can ever repay. If there is anything I can…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Just stay out of this… Today, whatever happens… stay out of it. I have returned the life of her mother to the princess. It would be really sad if she has to lose a brother today.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I…” He hesitated for a moment before looking up resolutely. “I Promise.”</p><p><br></p><p>While he was leaving, someone gathered their courage and asked. “Who are you?”</p><p><br></p><p>The man left the room only leaving a few words behind him.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am… who I am.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Victoria Valac -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She stood in front of their actual goal as several of their members worked furiously to complete the work.</p><p><br></p><p>While there were other reasons like destroying the Bael House’s influence over the underworld as well as punishing the ones who were involved in the whole mess with Lilith and Cleria.</p><p><br></p><p>Alicia was out for blood too since she found out about the truth of the Sleeping Sickness.</p><p><br></p><p>Victoria herself however didn’t have any reason other than following orders. She was obviously thankful to both Ophelia and Master Damien giving her a chance so that she doesn’t get sold off by her house to the highest bidder in the name of marriage.</p><p><br></p><p>Right now, she was one of the strongest devils in the Underworld even though most people didn’t know of it.</p><p><br></p><p>She no longer needed to fear such a fate as she could decide her own future. So she wanted to help out those who gave her this chance.</p><p><br></p><p>They needed to complete the work before the Satans became free and realised something was going on here.</p><p><br></p><p>Her job was to find and remove the surveillance devices from the place with her Clan Trait.</p><p><br></p><p>Diehauser Belial would assist her in this work.</p><p><br></p><p>“My Lady, we are done with the preparations.” One of Alicia’s peerage members came and reported.</p><p><br></p><p>According to Ophelia, Damien had reached the place too, which means that the Satans will not be moving from that place anytime soon.</p><p><br></p><p>“Prepare the illusion. We move at their signal.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, My Lady.”</p><p><br></p><p>It was almost time for the True Project Regicide to commence.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Damien -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I walked towards the place where Lilith was being kept.</p><p><br></p><p>On the way, I encountered some familiar faces.</p><p><br></p><p>The idiot trio.</p><p><br></p><p>It looks like they were done gathering their armies. The skies above the mansion were covered with their people being confronted by the armies of the Underworld.</p><p><br></p><p>Creuserey Asmodeus looked at me with hatred while Shalba frowned looking at me but kept his anger in check.</p><p><br></p><p>Katerea on the other hand, looked much tamer than before.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why are you here, traitor?” Creuserey shouted. “Do you think you can just come and go wherever you please?”</p><p><br></p><p>I was however not in the mood to argue with idiots today. “Move aside. I am not in a mood to play around today.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Who do you think you are to order us? Are you really that delusional to think that you can take on all of us, our armies just with a bunch of half breed trash.” He barked looking at Merlin and I sensed Merlin frowning.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at him and nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>All of my subordinates with Conqueror’s Haki let it roar together.</p><p><br></p><p>Even though they were not at my level yet, they were still extremely strong when it came to willpower.</p><p><br></p><p>The sky was divided into several parts under their combined Haki as red lightning flashed all over the sky. </p><p><br></p><p>The armies in the sky were struck by the sudden attack, falling down from the skies one after another under the horrified gazes of the two.</p><p><br></p><p>Katerea had some idea about our levels so she never said a word.</p><p><br></p><p>In a few moments, the entire sky was clear once more.</p><p><br></p><p>“Army? What army?” Merlin asked.</p><p><br></p><p>We walked past the stunned fools who were too shaken to even move let alone answer.</p><p><br></p><p>I could sense the people inside as soon as we crossed the walls of the dimension where the room was.</p><p><br></p><p>I heard the argument between Rizevim and Ajuka.</p><p><br></p><p>Even in such a situation, the new Beelzebub didn’t back down.</p><p><br></p><p>This man really deserved the title of the Beelzebub.</p><p><br></p><p>I entered the room but everyone’s focus was on Rizevim. Only Ajuka noticed me, his eyes widening slightly but he didn’t make any moves.</p><p><br></p><p>Rizevim was extending his hand to pick Lilith up from her place.</p><p><br></p><p>Several scenes flashed in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>Aria.</p><p><br></p><p>Razevan.</p><p><br></p><p>Gretel.</p><p><br></p><p>Leviathan.</p><p><br></p><p>Lucifer.</p><p><br></p><p>Him.</p><p><br></p><p>And before I knew it, I was holding him by his wrist, pushing his hand aside.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy was not expecting me and was taken aback for a moment.</p><p><br></p><p>I took the advantage of the situation to go and pick Lilith up. Recalling the last moments of Lucifer, I turned my head back and the words came to my lips on their own.</p><p><br></p><p>“Touching my Lilith’s body… you’re not worthy… <em>boy</em>.” I said icily.</p><p><br></p><p>Rizevim took an unconscious step back, his hands protecting his eyes. In the middle he realised what he was doing and then realised the situation. His eyes widened as he  looked at me as if he had seen a ghost.</p><p><br></p><p>____________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x_________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>And there it is….the moment which everyone was waiting for.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Yes.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>As many had guessed, Lord Bael did something stupid.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>But most of you would have rioted if the Milf had stayed dead.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>It was a good opportunity to recall the situation with Aria, only with a different ending this time.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>A poetic situation.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>As for Rizevim….well, we will see everything in the next chapter.</strong></p><p><strong>[Beta Note: Once again enjoy the Cliff ‘;..;’] [AN: It was the perfect place to stop.]</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>",

So that’s how it was hahahahaha. To think that you… Hahahaha. Well played indeed.” He walked towards me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Merlin, Gretel, Ingvild.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, my King.”</p><p><br></p><p>“If he takes another step forward… kill him.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Uyahahahahaha it seems you have learned jokes in the afterlife. Do you really think <em>they</em> can stop me?”</p><p><br></p><p>His question was answered when the combined auras of all three fell on him.</p><p><br></p><p>While still a bit behind the madman himself, they could very well take an arm off him should any of them go all out. All three of them… could kill any devil alive at this point.</p><p><br></p><p>The entire dimension shook as I created a barrier around me, protecting Lilith in my arms.</p><p><br></p><p>A frown appeared on his face as he realised their strengths.</p><p><br></p><p>Right at this moment another aura burst in the midst.</p><p><br></p><p>I glanced towards the source.</p><p><br></p><p>Ajuka.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will have to request that you all cease from fighting in this place. There is too much evidence and unrelated people here.” To his credit, even in this situation, he didn’t have any change of expressions. His voice was firm and there was not one hint of fear in his voice. Worthy of a Satan.</p><p><br></p><p>Too bad today I will get what I want.</p><p><br></p><p>I turned my eyes to look at Rizevim who understood the situation was not in his favour.</p><p><br></p><p>He smiled and raised hands in a mock surrender. “So scary. Everyone is getting serious but I see that you are not in the mood for a reunion right now. I will leave you to Mother. Let’s have fun the next time we meet. Oh who am I kidding, we’re totally going to have a <em>blast</em>.” He laughed again before turning around and walking out but not before throwing a look at me.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at him quietly as he walked away.</p><p><br></p><p>Every fibre of my being wanted to tear him apart with my bare hands right now but today was not the day for it. Everyone had worked very hard to make our current plan a success. I will not let it get wasted due to a moment of impulsiveness.</p><p><br></p><p>We walked out of the place too, me carrying Lilith in my arms.</p><p><br></p><p>As I brought her out of the mansion, I found myself staring at a massive crowd in front of me. The entire sky was full as was the ground as far as eyes could see.</p><p><br></p><p>Devils of all shapes and sizes, of all classes had gathered in front of us.</p><p><br></p><p>In the lead were the heads of almost every house among the Pillars, some standing while others kneeled just as I stepped out.</p><p><br></p><p>The scene looked completely unreal.</p><p><br></p><p>I noticed that the ones who were knocked out by Merlin and the others were all removed while my people, over twenty thousand devils, had gathered on the right side under the command of several of my immediate team members.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the years, we had gathered a decent amount of soldiers. After all, two hands can’t do the work of a thousand.</p><p><br></p><p>Among this, around fifty thousand were devils and thirty thousand were other species. We were the smallest group among the Abrahmic factions.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the Old Satan faction which was just above us in terms of numbers had around six times more people than us.</p><p><br></p><p>But what we missed in quantity, we made up for in terms of quality.</p><p><br></p><p>Each and every one of these twenty thousand soldiers were….high class at the very least.</p><p><br></p><p>This level of strength put us above even the Fallen Angels and almost on part with the current Devil government.</p><p><br></p><p>But all of this could be changed in just an instant.</p><p><br></p><p>All I needed to do was… show my face once in front of the underworld.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t lie to Sirzechs when I said that the current government was a sinking ship.</p><p><br></p><p>The people of the underworld wanted another option but they didn’t have any.</p><p><br></p><p>And the Old Satan faction… were never the representatives of the original Satans.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the main reasons the people of the underworld chose the current government was because the original Satans had passed away and their descendants wanted to continue the war which would have led to the extinction of the devil race.</p><p><br></p><p>But all of that changes when a true Satan gets involved.</p><p><br></p><p>And right now was a similar situation.</p><p><br></p><p>I however didn’t address them but turned towards Ajuka.</p><p><br></p><p>“Where is Zekram?”</p><p><br></p><p>“He is being detained for investigations.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Where?” I repeated.</p><p><br></p><p>“Goetia Prison. Asmodeus Territory.” he answered after a pause.</p><p><br></p><p>“Merlin… let’s go to the Goetia Prison.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Serafall -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She breathed a sigh of relief as he started to leave.</p><p><br></p><p>She was expecting him to appear but not at that time.</p><p><br></p><p>But then again, it would have been a catastrophe if Rizevim had taken Lilith away.</p><p><br></p><p>Although she didn’t know why… he seemed completely different from what they had seen a few hours ago.</p><p><br></p><p>It was as if she was watching a completely different person and the only thing common between them was their faces.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at the crowd in front of her, not even fathoming how messed up the situation was. First they find Lilith was alive and captured under the Bael estate and now a Lucifer look alike walks through the front door.</p><p><br></p><p>But what happened next was even more surprising. She didn’t think she would ever see a day when someone so blatantly threatened Rizevim and forced him to retreat.</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, maybe it was not an empty threat either. With the power each of his subordinates were throwing out, they could have ripped Rizevim apart… only the entire Bael Territory and a few surrounding territories would have been erased from the face of the Underworld as well.</p><p><br></p><p>At least the younger Lucifer seemed more amicable and they could negotiate some terms with him.</p><p><br></p><p>However all her hopes were dashed as Ajuka stepped forward.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at Ajuka who interrupted them. \"Zekram bael is still being investigated. We cannot allow anyone to meet him.\"</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Dammit Ajuka.</p><p><br></p><p>There was no way they could fight a war in these conditions. With the amount of things which were revealed today, if a fight starts….there would be another Civil War for sure.</p><p><br></p><p>Due to the deeds of the Great King faction and Zekram, people were incensed at them but also the current government and the Satans for not stopping them in the first place.</p><p><br></p><p>And if the literal miniature version of Lucifer were to get angry at this time…</p><p><br></p><p>Surely as expected, the crowd started roaring at this. Thousands of auras rose up at the same time representing all their moods.</p><p><br></p><p>Almost every Pillar House was among the crowd not to mention the thousands of devils who had come with him.</p><p><br></p><p>Each one of them was High Class or above. How in the seven heavens were they hiding such a force? </p><p><br></p><p>She was about to go forward to calm down the matter when Damien raised his hand and… the entire crowd stopped, their auras restrained.</p><p><br></p><p>Her words were swallowed back.</p><p><br></p><p>Even as prepared as she was, she felt a shiver run down her spine at the scene.</p><p><br></p><p>As a child, she was told a lot about the Satans, the powers they had, the people they commanded, how they had laid the foundation of the Devil race from the start.</p><p><br></p><p>Especially the creator of their race. Her parents talked about him even centuries after his death with utter respect.</p><p><br></p><p>He might be the embodiment of all the world’s evil for the rest of the world but for them, he was the equivalent of what the Father of Angels was to Heaven.</p><p><br></p><p>And today… she was able to see this with her own eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>To be honest, she had expected something like this before but… even in her wildest dream she didn’t imagine it would be something like this.</p><p><br></p><p>Just as she was going to go forward and diffuse the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>Damien looked back at Ajuka, looking utterly calm.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked towards the sky as dark clouds started rolling over the skies as crimson red lightning thundered all over the Underworld.</p><p><br></p><p>The worst part was that she didn’t sense any kind of magical power causing this phenomenon.</p><p><br></p><p>It was as if the Underworld itself was raging at the insult to its king.</p><p><br></p><p>The young man in front of her was giving her the feeling similar to what Sirzechs gives off in his True Form. It was an instinctual fear of death when looking at something overwhelmingly stronger than oneself.</p><p><br></p><p>But unlike Sirzechs who transformed into a mass of mindless destruction, this one’s essence was control….and majesty.</p><p><br></p><p>It was like someone was compressing an entire ocean into a drop of water, waiting to unleash all that at a moment's notice. The amount of power which makes one realise how small they actually were.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh….and who will stop me?”</p><p><br></p><p>The atmosphere chilled.</p><p><br></p><p>Falbium quickly went ahead and explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“We don’t wish to fight or stop you. We are just trying to keep the matter from getting any worse.”</p><p><br></p><p>Damien looked at him with a slightly unamused expression on his face.</p><p><br></p><p>“Who are you again?”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“I….I am the one chosen by the council to represent the Underworld as the current Asmodeus.” He replied, carefully choosing the words.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh….good for you.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>He turned towards the crowd and questioned loudly. “Who is the one investigating Zekram Bael?”</p><p><br></p><p>She took advantage of the situation and stepped forward. “We are not trying to protect Zekram by any means. Please try to understand that we don’t want this to result in a war. It’s just that too much information was brought to light today. We just want to make sure we don’t miss anything as well as address everything he might have done. This is just the standard procedure.”</p><p><br></p><p>He just looked at her with the same bone chilling blue eyes and no expressions.</p><p><br></p><p>“That was not my question.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh?”</p><p><br></p><p>It took her a second to realise what he had asked. “I am the one who was assigned the investigation of the crimes of Zekram Bael.\" She answered.</p><p><br></p><p>“You speak of standard procedures… Was a standard procedure followed when Cleria Belial was accused? If I remember correctly, the charges against her were similar, treachery… although, I don’t think there was any real evidence suggesting anything else except her relationship with a priest. I believe the job of investigating such an accusation is the responsibility of the one sitting on the throne?” he questioned and she winced.</p><p><br></p><p>Another one of Zekram’s actions.</p><p><br></p><p>“And before you try to blame it on Zekram or those involved in it, do remember that you all were also among the ones who had a say in it. A situation like hers could happen due to many reasons. Maybe she was trying to get information out of the priest or maybe she was just seducing the wielder of the Ame no Murakumo to the devil side, making him a member of her peerage. I believe some of the others here have members from the Church and the Fallen Angels… so why was standard procedure not followed for her? Tell me something… if it had been your little sister instead of Cleria Belial… would the standard procedure have been followed?”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at all the Satans present, daring anyone to talk. She held her tongue when Sona was brought up.</p><p><br></p><p>“We are trying…”</p><p><br></p><p>“And you have tried enough. Now… just stand on the side and watch how it’s done.” he cut her off.</p><p><br></p><p>He turned towards the crowd. \"But you are right about a single thing… Zekram is not just my criminal. So, in two hours there will be a public trial for Zekram Bael in The Lucifer's castle… I will personally be the judge.\"</p><p><br></p><p>She froze but he was not done. He looked towards the crowd.</p><p><br></p><p>\"If anyone has a problem, come forward.\"</p><p><br></p><p>She turned towards the crowd but not a single person moved.</p><p><br></p><p>There was someone who was going to step forward however.</p><p><br></p><p>Ajuka.</p><p><br></p><p>He has always been stubborn in a weird sort of way… however, before he could say anything, a hand fell on his shoulder.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at the owner of the hand.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs?</p><p><br></p><p>Behind him were a few other people.</p><p><br></p><p>Chysis Gremory and a Twin tailed girl with Crimson hair similar to his but she didn't recognise her. The girl however was just looking towards Damien with fearful eyes, almost shivering lightly.</p><p><br></p><p>She quickly went forward and kneeled in front of him, not even daring to look up anymore.</p><p><br></p><p>It was the ones behind him that made her pause.</p><p><br></p><p>Venelana Gremory?</p><p><br></p><p>Wasn’t she dead?</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at Falbium who was looking at Damien with a heavy gaze.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy in question then turned towards the twin tailed girl.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I want Zekram there. Drag him there if you have to. Any questions?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"N-n-none, my King.\"</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>With his words said, he walked forward, Lilith still in his arms.</p><p><br></p><p>The crowd parted as he walked, several of the older devils, the same ones who were arrogant in front of them, kneeled, in front of him, not even daring to look up.</p><p><br></p><p>His subordinates followed behind him as Gretel Lucifuge stepped forward and a grey mist spread out from his body, covering everyone who followed. It took her a moment to realise what it was.</p><p><br></p><p>Dimension Lost.</p><p><br></p><p>Another Longinus.</p><p><br></p><p>Just how many of those did they have?</p><p><br></p><p>And Dimension Lost on her?</p><p><br></p><p>She was already nearly a Super Devil and to give a Longinus to her with her already crazy Space magic….</p><p><br></p><p>This was a level where she would be able to match even Sirzechs and Ajuka easily.</p><p><br></p><p>She suddenly had a dangerous premonition.</p><p><br></p><p>Did all of them have Sacred Gears?</p><p><br></p><p>Because this would be the fourth or fifth Longinus they have.</p><p><br></p><p>And then an even scarier thought came to her mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Did he also…?</p><p><br></p><p>She looked towards the man in the lead as they walked into the mist in horror.</p><p><br></p><p>A few moments later, he and his subordinates all disappeared with the mist as the crowd erupted.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at Sirzechs who shook his head and signalled them to walk somewhere private first.</p><p><br></p><p>Their peerages stayed behind to address the crowd while they went back inside.</p><p><br></p><p>She first went and gave Venelana a light hug. She was still confused but Venelana was a close friend to her family and has been like a family member to her since her childhood. Seeing her dead body had been tough for her too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay, what is going on? Not that I am unhappy about it but how? I am pretty sure Lady Gremory was…  And who is she?” At last she pointed towards the girl with them.</p><p><br></p><p>Ajuka didn’t say anything but just watched from the side.</p><p><br></p><p>“She is… Runeas Gremory, my ancestor.”</p><p><br></p><p>Runeas?</p><p><br></p><p>The first Gremory?</p><p><br></p><p>Another one of the old ones?</p><p><br></p><p>But there were far more important things to consider right now.</p><p><br></p><p>“And Damien? What’s the deal with Damien Lucifer? Is he roleplaying as Lucifer to take advantage of the situation and take power? His attitude was…”</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs face took on a complicated expression.</p><p><br></p><p>The answer came from somewhere else.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mind your words, girl. You don’t know what you’re talking about.” Runeas Gremory snapped at her.</p><p><br></p><p>Serafall was taken aback at the intensity of her words.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at Sirzechs questioningly.</p><p><br></p><p>He answered nonetheless.</p><p><br></p><p>“Damien… is a reincarnation.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A Reincarnation? But who exactl…” Her words paused in between as she realised the meaning of the words… and a few seconds later the implications of the meaning and a chill ran down her spine.</p><p><br></p><p>At that point, only one word escaped her mouth.</p><p><br></p><p>“Fuck!”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Sirzechs -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the expressions of his friends. To be honest, he was not sure his own was any better when he figured everything out.</p><p><br></p><p>His mother’s death….had hit him harder than he ever thought it would. Perhaps the only reason he was able to hold his sanity was because Lord Bael was not in front of him and his family surrounded him at the moment and him changing into his True Form would have become a danger for them.</p><p><br></p><p>After Damien’s claim and the… miracle he had performed, really, there were no other words for what he did, he too had been stunned beyond disbelief.</p><p><br></p><p>As he collected himself, over the next few minutes, just as Damien had said, he tried to remember everything about him and sure enough a few things became obvious.</p><p><br></p><p>He had always insisted that he never lied… and that he was ‘The Devil’. In fact, he had almost rubbed it in everyone’s face and yet… the thought was so out of the way, it never even came to him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure? But how can it be?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ancestor went to meet him to get his help and he said things only Lucifer knew. But I wanted to confirm his words so first I called someone who had been in contact with Damien the whole time… Azazel.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Flashback -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He waited with bated breath as the call connected. At this point, he didn’t even know what he was thinking.</p><p><br></p><p>The things which had happened in the last half an hour had made him question everything he had known yet.</p><p><br></p><p>Damien was Lucifer.</p><p><br></p><p>Not the descendant but the actual Lucifer himself.</p><p><br></p><p>He knew for sure that he was created by the Old Satan faction from the blood of the two previous Satans but this…</p><p><br></p><p>The call connected and Azazel's voice sounded from the other end of the Magic Circle.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I think you should be concentrating on the affairs around you rather than calling me at such a time, Sirzechs.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"This is a very important matter, Azazel.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"That it is. And I assume you are asking about Damien and Rizevim?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Yes. Damien is…\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I think you are forgetting that he is an ally of ours. What makes you think I will give away his information?\"</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>\"Not to mention, it wouldn't change a thing even if I did.\" </p><p><br></p><p>\"It's a matter of life and death for my race, Azazel. I am not asking you for anything you don't want to say. But just confirm one thing for me. Is Damien actually Lucifer?\"</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>\"Just how in Father's name do you all screw up this much? The guy wanted to live a life of peace for once. *<em>Sigh</em>*.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"We didn't know anything.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"But you <em>are</em> the leader and thus you <em>have</em> to take responsibility for this. For Damien, I sincerely hope you won't do anything to make him go back to being that monster again, because if you do….I might not make this a matter of the Grigori for the sake of my people….but I will certainly make it personal. As for the information, you should ask Odin. I won't tell you anything beyond this.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"... I see. Thank you.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"What did he say, Sirzechs?\" His father asked.</p><p><br></p><p>He didn't answer but made the next call to Odin and asked the same question.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next half an hour, he talked to him and found out the real identity of Damien Lucifer. Odin didn’t tell him anything about his faction or even his powers but just about his identity because the old Godking had noticed the fact that he never hid anything.</p><p><br></p><p>But even after all that, he still made one more call….this time to someone who wouldn't want Lucifer to return more than anyone else….Michael.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>– Flashback Ends –</strong></p><p><br></p><p>\"Did Michael confirm it?” Serafall asked.</p><p><br></p><p>The reason he called Michael was also because he couldn’t lie. That’s why the conversation with him was enlightening.</p><p><br></p><p>“He denied speaking on the topic at all. The only thing he said was that ‘Lucifer never lied.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So… either they all are lying or… the fools from the Old Satan Faction tried to create a clone of the Devil and ended up creating the perfect vessel for him to reincarnate in instead. But how is that even possible? Devil souls don’t reincarnate. That’s what we have been learning so far. They just disappear.” Serafall questioned.</p><p><br></p><p>“But Lucifer wasn’t always a Devil.” Ajuka spoke for the first time since the conversation started. “And even the way he became one is unknown… so, we don’t know how things would have worked out for him. Although, there <em>is</em> a non-zero chance that they are just playing a game with us but that chance is too low for us to take any risk.”</p><p><br></p><p>He thought about it. “We will see what he does. Remember, our main goal is the safety and peace of the Underworld and the Devil race. Anything else is secondary. Our actions will only be based on that. If he tries to start another war, we will confront him. Till then…”</p><p><br></p><p>The words were left unsaid but it was clear to everyone.</p><p><br></p><p>“But why are they not here yet? He said he will be coming to Lucifer's castle.” Serafall asked.</p><p><br></p><p>The one who answered this was his Ancestor.</p><p><br></p><p>“Because this… is not Lucifer's castle. The actual Lucifer’s castle is in Lilith… not this place. It’s the place where the seventy two Pillars and the Extra Devil clans were created. This place might have things similar to the old one, even a throne but it’s… just an imitation. He is not the kind of guy to settle for an imitation.”</p><p><br></p><p>A look of realisation seemed to dawn on their faces.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Runeas Gremory -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She walked down the dungeon stairs to the room where Zekram was being kept.</p><p><br></p><p>When she was awakened by Chysis, she was not expecting such a big mess.</p><p><br></p><p>He was keeping Lilith?</p><p><br></p><p>To be honest, it was a bit odd considering how careful he was whenever trying to pull one of his schemes but this was still too big to matter.</p><p><br></p><p>Especially with <em>him</em> being back.</p><p><br></p><p>Dammit. How could she have known it was not some fifteen sixteen year old brat and instead the actual devil. Especially with what Chysis had told her about the boy.</p><p><br></p><p>She had messed up badly.</p><p><br></p><p>To think she would offer the position of Satan Lucifer… to Lucifer.</p><p><br></p><p>If this had been back when the rest of the Pillar Devils were alive, she would have been erased before she could even clarify things out. And if by some Satanic miracle she managed to clear things up, she would still have been punished… just like Leviathan had punished her.</p><p><br></p><p>A fact known by only the original Satans. Not even the other Pillars knew of it.</p><p><br></p><p>Not to mention the words spoken when they were first created. Those were the things not even the other Satans knew. Only Lucifer and Lilith knew.</p><p><br></p><p>But she didn’t need those to identify him. She knew the moment he started talking.</p><p><br></p><p>His presence… it was nigh impossible to copy.</p><p><br></p><p>So, if Zekram was involved even slightly, which she didn't doubt he was… it was going to be very bad for him.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps the only silver lining in all this is that <em>He</em> was the only one who could stop the situation from going to an all out war or stop Rizevim as he did.</p><p><br></p><p>Chysis opened the door of the place for her to enter.</p><p><br></p><p>Inside the room, Zekram was sitting with his eyes closed. His demonic power was sealed so that he couldn’t escape the room.</p><p><br></p><p>He opened his eyes when he heard the sound of the door opening.</p><p><br></p><p>“Have you come to watch me fall, Runeas?” He questioned.</p><p><br></p><p>“I think I already missed that.”</p><p><br></p><p>He rolled his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t ask him anything. They would get the answer anyway.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, what is it going to be? Hold me responsible for everything? Used as a sacrifice, a scapegoat to divert the attention and calm down the people?” He spoke. </p><p><br></p><p>“Oh stop playing a victim in this situation Zekram. They might not know but I do. Even if all of those things were not done by you, most of them certainly were, But that doesn’t matter now does it. You committed the very last thing you should have. Lilith…”</p><p><br></p><p>He kept his mouth shut, not speaking anything.</p><p><br></p><p>She scoffed. “If you are worried that we are broadcasting this, don’t be. We don’t need any confession from you. You cannot fall any lower. All that’s left today is for you to be judged.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And who is going to be judging me?”</p><p><br></p><p>“You will be judged by Satan Lucifer.” Chysis answered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha Satan Lucifer. Fancying himself Lucifer now is he, Sirzechs, that half pint brat?”</p><p><br></p><p>None of them answered.</p><p><br></p><p>“So… the allure of power finally did him in too.”</p><p><br></p><p>She pulled him out, Chysis following close behind them.</p><p><br></p><p>Up the stairs, Zeoticus was waiting for them with Venelana.</p><p><br></p><p>They exchanged glances to Zekram and his eyes paused at the woman for a few moments. “You might call yourself a Gremory as much as you want but you will always be a Bael. My blood.”</p><p><br></p><p>Venelana didn’t show any change of expressions. She merely looked back at the man with an eerily calm gaze.</p><p><br></p><p>Death… could cause people to change.</p><p><br></p><p>Her thoughts went to <em>him</em>. Did he change too?</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at Zekram and shook her head. Not that it would matter. No matter whether he changes or not, the actions taken by Zekram had crossed the line.</p><p><br></p><p>Without any other words she teleported them out to the city of Lilith.</p><p><br></p><p>They appeared among the familiar ruins of the old Lilith. The city had been destroyed in the Great War and repaired once, only to get completely razed down in the Civil War.</p><p><br></p><p>It was decided to make the new city at a different location. The public reason was to preserve the site of the first Lucifer’s castle, to show that the new Satans were just paying homage to them and not exactly replacing them.</p><p><br></p><p>The actual reason was because this place brought back the memories of two devastating wars.</p><p><br></p><p>And thus, just a few years later, this entire city had become a ghost town. No one lived here, and the only people who came here were the occasional first generation Devils, who cleaned and maintained the place to hold on to the memories of their younger age and comrades.</p><p><br></p><p>But today was different.</p><p><br></p><p>Today… the whole place was filled with people as far as eyes could see.</p><p><br></p><p>Both the grounds and skies were covered by devils wherever one looked.</p><p><br></p><p>They walked towards Lucifer's castle. The crowd grew loud, thousands of auras spiking at the sight of Zekram but none of them attacked even when they passed by them.</p><p><br></p><p>Near the castle, Sirzechs stood to receive them. At this time, Zekram spoke once more.</p><p><br></p><p>“Going all out with the symbolism? Judging me from Lucifer's seat, do you think this relic of the past would change anything? This city died with Lucifer. Just like he cannot come back from death, just sitting on Lucifer’s throne won’t make you The Devil.”</p><p><br>Even now, he had the tone of a man who had things under his control. She really wondered what the source of his confidence is.</p><p><br></p><p>Was he simply to deny the allegations as a terrorist act? Did he think that would work? Or was he planning to use someone as a scapegoat?</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs however just turned towards him calmly and replied with an even tone. “I know.”</p><p><br></p><p>The crowd parted, making a way as they neared the place.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs stopped as they got to the place where a girl stood and signalled to her that they had reached the place.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl brought out a document. “Zekram Bael. Read this and sign.”</p><p><br></p><p>He merely glanced at the document.</p><p><br></p><p>“It states that you wish to continue with the trial and will answer every question you are asked as long as you are in this room and you will do so truthfully.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man signed it with a scoff and threw aside the document. “Let’s get this farce over with.” He said to Sirzechs.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am afraid it’s not me who will be your judge today.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What?” He asked, looking confused for the first time.</p><p><br></p><p>She however didn’t give him any chance to gather his thoughts as she caught a hold of Zekram’s hand, making the man confused before she kicked his knee, making the man crash into the ground with a growl of pain.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at her stunned.</p><p><br></p><p>“I was ordered to drag you in. I cannot afford to mess up anymore.”</p><p><br></p><p>Without giving him any chance to speak, she dragged him inside the room.</p><p><br></p><p>After over a thousand years, she entered the oddly familiar. The majestic walls of the hall were fractured in many places, the roof had been destroyed, leaving the place open to the elements. The only reason it was not a pile of dead and decaying mess was because of the barriers kept over it to preserve it.</p><p><br></p><p>But despite all this, the atmosphere inside the room didn’t change one bit.</p><p><br></p><p>On either side of the room were two rows of chairs, each containing thirty six chairs, a total of seventy two chairs.</p><p><br></p><p>Most of them were filled with the current Pillar Heads. The Gremory chair was still empty, probably left for her.</p><p><br></p><p>At the head of the hall, just below the throne were six chairs, each for the six houses of Lucifer. Currently only three of them were full, the Lucifuge girl taking the seat. The other two were the ones she didn’t know but from their looks, they seemed to be a Satanachia and a Nebiros devil.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally on the top of a platform was a throne on which sat the Devil himself. On his two sides were the Leviathan girl and Merlin.</p><p><br></p><p>The scene reminded her of the days of the old where such meetings were last held. How long had it been since this was changed to the farce that was today’s council.</p><p><br></p><p>She left dumbfounded Zekram, who looked as if he had seen a ghost, on the ground and stepped forward, kneeling on the ground. “I have completed your command, my King.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Good. You have done well. Take your seat.”</p><p><br></p><p>She bowed before going and taking the Gremory seat and looked at Zekram who had shaking stood up but was still looking at the throne as if in a trance.</p><p><br></p><p><em>He</em> however was not in a mood to give him any time.</p><p><br></p><p>“Have you forgotten basic manners, Zekram? Or do I have to remind you how to greet your king?” He spoke.</p><p><br></p><p>The words seemed to have broken him out of his trance as he backed away a few steps, shaken completely. To be honest, she understood the feeling. Only Zekram had messed up even worse.</p><p><br></p><p>“Kneel.” Lucifer ordered.</p><p><br></p><p>Zekram however was still in a state of disbelief and didn’t pay attention.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you not hear me Zekram? I said… <em>kneel</em>.”</p><p><br></p><p>“N-no. This is not real.  Do you think you can fool me with a disguise of an illusion? Who are you? Ajuka, Sirzechs, Serafall? Colluding with the likes of them,” he pointed towards Merlin and the Leviathan girl, “to take over the Underworld. Do you think of yourself as the King of the Underworld? Do you think you can make me kneel? Dream on, kid. I would never… arghhhhhhhhh.”</p><p><br></p><p>His rant however was cut short as both of his legs, right till his knees were sliced off by two spears of black light.</p><p><br></p><p>The signature move of Lucifer.</p><p><br></p><p>He fell down to the ground… on his knees and tried to keep his balance as a voice sounded from the throne above.</p><p><br></p><p>“There you go. See… was it so hard? All you had to do was be a good kid and you could have spared yourself the unnecessary pain. Did this help wake you up… or do I have to give it another go?”</p><p><br></p><p>She felt a shiver down her spine.</p><p><br></p><p>A non zero chance, her ass.</p><p><br></p><p>That moss head brat didn’t know what he was speaking.</p><p><br></p><p>No way it was anyone else than him.</p><p><br></p><p>Zekram sat on the ground, swallowing his cries of pain and looked at the devil, his face pale, finally realising how badly he was fucked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Now that we have the formalities out of the way, shall we begin the proceedings.” Lucifer ordered.</p><p><br></p><p>Merlin stepped forward and brought out a document. “Zekram Bael has been accused of seventy three direct and two hundred and eighty three indirect murders of Pillar Devils and Extra Devil Clan members, provoking war between the houses of the Devil faction, manipulating evidence, framing innocents, bribery…” The list went on and on.</p><p><br></p><p>It was taken from the evidence they had received from his own home because she was sure that if they had every piece of information on him, the murder counts would have crossed a thousand easily. Serafall had put together the entire document in the two hours they were given.</p><p><br></p><p>“... creating and spreading the Devil’s Sleeping sickness and using it against fellow houses of the Underworld, and finally… attacking and keeping, the Mother of all Devil, Lilith hostage for over a thousand years.” Merlin read and stepped back.</p><p><br></p><p>Lucifer looked at Zekram and questioned.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tell me Zekram, did you kill or have those people killed?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I… Yes.” Zekram answered and then looked stunned at the answer himself, his own throat to check.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t be surprised. You did sign a magical contract that you will answer all the questions asked in this hall truthfully, didn’t you? The contract was made by me personally. And you voluntarily agreed to it too. So let’s not waste our time. Why did you do so?”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>The contract?</p><p><br></p><p>Was it a binding contract? Could he even make these kinds of things?</p><p><br></p><p>She eyed him in disbelief.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the next twenty minutes, Zekram was forced to speak about every piece of crime he had committed over the years to remove his political and economic rivals.</p><p><br></p><p>Some of the pieces of information were shocking even to her.</p><p><br></p><p>The methods he had used to kill people were truly… by leaking information to the Old Satan faction, Fallen Angels and even the Church to finish off anyone who had been an inconvenience to him.</p><p><br></p><p>As she had expected, the numbers were far above what he had been accused of.</p><p><br></p><p>The names of the targets were frightening too, including six original Pillar devils who had been removed. She felt a chill run down her spine at the news.</p><p><br></p><p>Some of the names received violent reactions from the Pillar Heads, for example the death of the Barbatos Head, who was the father of the one representing the House. The current head was under arrest, being investigated after the reveal of the Rating Games scam. He had removed the previous head and put the current head on the seat because the previous Head didn’t want to join his faction.</p><p><br></p><p>The next question came.</p><p><br></p><p>“Were you, directly or indirectly involved in the attack on Ingrid Leviathan, the granddaughter of Leviathan?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>The Leviathan girl beside him eyed Zekram with a gaze that could kill.</p><p><br></p><p>“... Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>A massive aura burst out from the Leviathan girl before he commanded. “Ingvild. Calm down.”</p><p><br></p><p>The aura disappeared as quickly as it had appeared. The girl took a deep breath and glared at Zekram with a freezing gaze but didn’t let out her aura anymore.</p><p><br></p><p>Ingrid Leviathan was someone who was very different from the rest of her family. A friendly girl who preferred to stay out of trouble unlike the rest of her siblings who were violent brats who killed on a whim.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you have her daughter, Ingvild Leviathan infected with the Sleeping Sickness?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Why?”</p><p><br></p><p>“To have her recruited into a peerage of a member of the Bael House and merge the bloodline with mine and create a branch house.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Just how many pits had he dug for himself?</p><p><br></p><p>But now was not the time to worry about that because only one case remained.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole venue became quiet, holding their breaths.</p><p><br></p><p>His casual attitude, which he had adorned for the entirety of the meeting disappeared as all expressions from his face faded away as well.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you… directly or indirectly… infect Lilith… with the Sleeping Sickness?”</p><p><br></p><p>Zekram gritted his teeth, trying to stop the words but failed. “... yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>And the entire crowd rioted.</p><p><br></p><p>Almost every Devil released their power, concentrating it on the downed man who was crushed under the combined pressure.</p><p><br></p><p>“Be quiet!” Lucifer shouted, raising his voice for the first time since the meeting started, taking the whole crowd by surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>All their auras dispersed immediately.</p><p><br></p><p>He stood up and walked down the stairs towards the centre of the room where Zekram lay crumbled on the ground, standing right in front of him.</p><p><br></p><p>All this time his demonic power kept rising. It was beyond anything she had seen before, even Rizevim.</p><p><br></p><p>She had heard from Chysis that Sirzechs was called the strongest devil but was he stronger than him?</p><p><br></p><p>The whole place started cracking when Merlin stood up and walked forward.</p><p><br></p><p>“Balance Breaker.”</p><p><br></p><p>The whole castle and the surrounding area was enveloped in an expanding bubble as the area around them transformed into an eerily familiar place.</p><p><br></p><p>She almost forgot to breathe at the familiar sight.</p><p><br></p><p>It was the scene from the day the seventy pillars were created and he had addressed them with Lilith.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you remember this scene Zekram?” he asked, looking down at him.</p><p><br></p><p>There was no answer as Zekram had gone into a state of shock.</p><p><br></p><p>The King looked towards her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you?”</p><p><br></p><p>She hurriedly stood up and kneeled. “Yes, my King. It is from the day the seventy two Pillars were created.” She answered.</p><p><br></p><p>The people around her all gasped at the information. It was understandable as this was the day the Devil race was more or less founded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Correct.” he looked back at Zekram. “And on this day… I told you all something about betraying the Underworld and me. But it seems you have forgotten it. So let me refresh your memory.”</p><p><br></p><p>He picked up Zekram by his neck, raising him above the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have delivered you unto this existence… and I can just as easily pluck you out of it… The choice was yours to make… and you Zekram… made the wrong choice.”</p><p><br></p><p>And with those words he flicked his wrist, snapping the neck of Zekram Bael with ease and tossing the body.</p><p><br></p><p>The Great King of the Seventy Two Pillars of the Underworld’s devil race… died with a look of horror still etched on his face.</p><p><br></p><p>Lucifer looked around the room, staring every Head of the House into their eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Does anyone have any problem with my decision?”</p><p><br></p><p>No one spoke a word.</p><p><br></p><p>“I’m still waiting for my answer.” he repeated, a bit louder this time.</p><p><br></p><p>Almost immediately choruses of denial rang through the room.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good.” He next looked around the room at Sirzechs and the other three. “Sirzechs Gremory, Ajuka Astaroth, Serafall Sitri, Falbium Glasya-Labolas.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs walked forward and the rest followed.</p><p><br></p><p>“You four… have saved the Underworld… and the Devil race from what could have been a dead end. For that I thank you. There is no doubt that each one of you has dedicated your life for the future of the Underworld… and thus, the titles that you were given… are well deserved.” His voice sounded throughout the whole venue and due to Merlin’s spell, the scene was seen by the entire city. “I am sure that my comrades, your predecessors wouldn’t have minded it one bit. I know I don’t. You all are good leaders.”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at the scene, strangely.</p><p><br></p><p>He was praising them?</p><p><br></p><p>Did he want to reduce the burden of the whole incident on them by these words?</p><p><br></p><p>“...but you are not good kings.”</p><p><br></p><p>The whole crowd focused on the conversation due to the sudden change.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you know the difference between a leader and a King?” He looked at the four. “The king reigns but does not govern. You four on the other hand became so engrossed in <em>governing</em> that you forgot that you sit on the throne of a King. The Devil race isn’t a democracy. It wasn’t made to be one. It’s not in their blood. Believe me, I would know.”</p><p><br></p><p>By now the entire venue had gone back into silence.</p><p><br></p><p>“And yet you let them control you. <em>That</em>… was a mistake and <em>this</em>… is the result.”</p><p><br></p><p>The four of them listened quietly. “Today, I am giving you all a chance. Zekram was just one person. There were several others who had assisted him in one way or the other… and they are still free out there. I assume they will be tried for their crimes as well.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good. So, when you sentence them today… make sure you do what a King would do. There should be no kindness shown to traitors. Don’t let today’s situation arise ever again… or I would definitely keep the promise I made to your father’s bishop the first time we met. I am the Devil of my word after all.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs flinched lightly.</p><p><br></p><p>She would have to ask them what promise he had made just to make sure they didn;t accidentally mess up.</p><p><br></p><p>With his words said, he walked out of the hall.</p><p><br></p><p>All the House heads bowed till he left the room.</p><p><br></p><p>Two minutes after he had left, she finally let out a sigh of relief.</p><p><br></p><p>At this time, one of Falbium Glasya-Labolas’ peerage members rushed in.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sir, sir.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What happened?” He asked gruffly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sir… Agreas… The terrorists took away the floating island of Agreas.”</p><p><br></p><p>“WHAT!”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Damien -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>We walked out to see a strange scene in front of us.</p><p><br></p><p>Zeoticus and Venelana were standing in front of a large crowd of devils. Behind them were a few people. I recognised them as Lady Bael and her son along with another black haired child, Sairaorg Bael.</p><p><br></p><p>It took me a moment to understand the situation. The crowd were trying to hold them responsible for the actions of Zekram and Lord Bael and go on a crusade… Seriously, who are these people Devils or Church members?</p><p><br></p><p>As I walked nearer, I heard the conversation clearer.</p><p><br></p><p>Zeoticus and Venelana were trying to protect them from the angry mob.</p><p><br></p><p>“The sins of Zekram had nothing to do with these children.” They argued.</p><p><br></p><p>“Their ancestor killed so many Pillar Devils and even attacked Lady Lilith. Even their father must have been involved in the whole crime as the head of the house. They must be purged so that their name doesn’t taint the Underworld again.” The one at the head of the crowd, one of the people I recognised who had his family members killed by Zekram’s plots and his house declared extinct later on, shouted as he threw a spell.</p><p><br></p><p>I exchanged a look with Merlin and he was already in action before the guy’s spell even completed, making a barrier in front of them. The attack clashed against the barrier and dissipated.</p><p><br></p><p>The attacker turned back in anger but his face turned pale at the sight of me. All of them quickly kneeled.</p><p><br></p><p>“My Father started the Great War and yet I don’t see anyone throwing stones at me.” I spoke. “I know you are angry but don’t let your anger cloud your judgement. The children had nothing to do with it. They are innocent… and if you were to harm or kill any of them… you would be doing the same thing as Zekram.”</p><p><br></p><p>I walked forward to them and looked at Zeoticus and Venelana. “Have the adults of the Bael House investigated and the children sent to the houses of their other parents. I do not wish to hear of any harm coming to these children. We are devils. We don’t harm our children… That’s what humans do.”</p><p><br></p><p>The two bowed and I turned to the black haired boy.</p><p><br></p><p>Sairaorg Bael.</p><p><br></p><p>I had heard about him a lot from Merlin but I had hardly seen his performance.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you angry, scared?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>To my surprise he shook his head. “No Sir.”</p><p><br></p><p>There was no lie in his statement.</p><p><br></p><p>I checked it with my Prince of Lies.</p><p><br></p><p>He was actually not angry or scared of the crowd.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tell me child, what is your dream?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I want to become a Satan.”</p><p><br></p><p>Several aggressive voices were heard as a reply to the proclamation.</p><p><br></p><p>I raised a hand and the crowd stopped.</p><p><br></p><p>“With the stigma of your name, it will be nigh impossible for you to sit on one of those thrones. “ I said.</p><p><br></p><p>“But not completely impossible, right?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No… not completely impossible.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then I will work hard to clear this name and win their approval.”</p><p><br></p><p>I stared right into his eyes and a bit of my Conqueror’s Haki seeped out, putting pressure on him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you know what you are saying, child?”</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t cower. Even when the pressure got heavier, he didn’t back down and bore everything with gritted teeth, not saying a word.</p><p><br></p><p>Slowly but surely, his own Haki was forced out, making sparks appear in the atmosphere.</p><p><br></p><p>A clash of Conqueror’s Haki.</p><p><br></p><p>I pulled back my aura as a smile came to my face. “Good. Very good. In that case, work, train, become stronger and the day you win the approval of the Underworld… I will personally crown you.”</p><p><br></p><p>Several murmurs and exclaims ran through the crowd.</p><p><br></p><p>I put a hand on his head and walked by.</p><p><br></p><p>A bit ahead, I saw Rias, present with her grandmother and Grayfia.</p><p><br></p><p>She saw me coming their way and ran up to me and gave me a tight hug.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank You for helping me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You’re welcome, princess.”</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t stay behind after that and all of us teleported away to our own base.</p><p><br></p><p>Today’s goal was already achieved.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>We stood in front of the huge island in front of us as Gretel and Merlin threw spells after spells at it to hide its existence from the rest of the world.</p><p><br></p><p>The floating island of Agraes. The only place in the world where Agaresite, the material used for making Evil Pieces, were found.</p><p><br></p><p>It was the actual goal of Project Regicide.</p><p><br></p><p>“I still don’t believe this was your goal all along and everything with Zekram Bael… was just a distraction for this. I am pretty sure the old man would have died of an aneurysm had he known of this.” Sean joked lightly. “I mean everyone was assuming that destroying the Bael House and Zekram was the Project Regicide.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at him oddly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you know what Regicide means?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“The killing of a King, right?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Exactly. So, if I consider killing him as Project Regicide, wouldn't it also mean that I consider him a King in the first place? Zekram Bael was not a king. Just an idiot who thought too highly of himself. This end is exactly what he deserved.” I replied as I sat down and Sean sat down beside me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Not to mention, this island was the biggest trump card in their possession. Should Ajuka actually go all out, he could have made hundreds of King Pieces with the entire reserve of Agarasite, raising an army of Ultimate Class beings easily. Now, that would have been scary. I couldn’t risk that happening… so I removed it from the equation all together.”</p><p><br></p><p>“In life, the King represents the future and I just took away their future. This is a complete checkmate… the actual Project Regicide.” I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>Let’s see how they handle the situation  now.</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>This chapter took a day longer than I was expecting because I got a bad case of Pink Eye.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am all healed now.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>And here’s your chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Things happened.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>We will see the reaction and get some idea about Damien’s actions and long term goal in the next chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I hope you all like this.</strong></p><p><strong><br>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>",

You have already seen the memories.\"</p><p><br></p><p>He took a deep breath. \"What are you going to do now?\"</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled at him getting directly at that question. \"Not asking me to come back?\"</p><p><br></p><p>He deadpanned. \"Would you?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Not right now.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"No point in asking, then. Since when did you ever listen to me?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Eh… I am pretty sure there were times.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Name two?\"</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>\"Wanna have a drink?\" I offered a middle path.</p><p><br></p><p>He remained expressionless.</p><p><br></p><p>I remembered that disappointed look which he took from <em>him</em> to the point. And it was quite painful to be on the other side of that look.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Alright alright. No need to get so serious. I… want to collect all five Holy Relics. They have been calling out to me ever since I accidentally encountered the True Longinus for the first time. Every time I touch one, my soul heals a bit and… I have a feeling that I will get… to meet <em>him</em> when I make contact with all five.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Now that attracted his attention.</p><p><br></p><p>\"So that's why…\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Yes. I have three of them. The Shroud was the fourth. Only the Holy Cross is left.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I will send a lookout for it. We are always on the lookout for the wielder's of the Relics whenever they appear. It's just that we are hardly ever lucky.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Don't worry. I already know who has it. We just need to find their exact location. Not to mention… I have a very important task before going after it first.\"</p><p><br></p><p>He raised an eyebrow.</p><p><br></p><p>I let out a sigh. \"The Underworld… they <em>are</em> my responsibility.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"And… Rizevim?\" He asked, seriously.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Is mine. I won't negotiate on this.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"You don't have to do everything alone.\" He offered but I shook my head.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Everything else is negotiable. This… is not. This… is too personal for me. He is my biggest mistake and I will clear it with my own hands. Myself.\"</p><p><br></p><p>He let out a sigh. \"Just… Promise that you will call for help if you ever need it.\"</p><p><br></p><p>I hesitated a bit before nodding.</p><p><br></p><p>We talked about a lot of different things and it was time for him to leave finally and I asked something which had been on my mind for a long time.</p><p><br></p><p>\"How is she?\"</p><p><br></p><p>Michael paused.</p><p><br></p><p>A pained look came on his face.</p><p><br></p><p>I could tell that it was quite real.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Her soul departed at the same time as Father's.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Despite knowing that I wasn't related to her, the words affected me.</p><p><br></p><p>A part of me wanted to shout and rage and burn everything down while another part of me was just immensely sad.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I…\" Michael started to say something but I shook my head, stopping him mid sentence.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy didn't say anything more. But then again, he was probably the only one who could understand the extent of Lucifer's feelings for his mother apart from their Father.</p><p><br></p><p>He let out a sigh and walked out of the bar.</p><p><br></p><p>Merlin took the chance to walk out beside me. \"The plans in the Underworld are almost at the last phase. We need to prepare.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Okay.\"</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Zeoticus Gremory -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Until a few hours ago, he had thought that the day couldn’t get any crazier. The younger looking copy of Lucifer along with his party of mind numbing companions was enough to give them sleepless nights for years.</p><p><br></p><p>He was just thankful that they were not as blood thirsty as their other family members which provided a chance to negotiate with them.</p><p><br></p><p>And then this thing came up.</p><p><br></p><p>They rushed as soon as they got the message about the attacks.</p><p><br></p><p>Six of the Top Ten Rating Game players had rebelled out of nowhere.</p><p><br></p><p>No. It wasn’t out of nowhere. At least not for everyone.</p><p><br></p><p>Two of them had reasons, losing a lot in the recent fiasco with the Youkai. But the rest were a surprise as they really had no reason to rebel.</p><p><br></p><p>It was something they still hadn’t figured out yet.</p><p><br></p><p>As soon as they reached home, they were greeted by Grayfia who was keeping a guard on Rias and Milicas.</p><p><br></p><p>Venelana had gone to the Bael House to talk about the Sleeping sickness and find out the truth while they were visiting the new Lucifer's bar.</p><p><br></p><p>“Father, Onii-sama, Grandmother.” His daughter ran up to him and he proceeded to hug her tightly.</p><p><br></p><p>She was attacked as well.</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully the attackers were not expecting her power level and were defeated due to the element of surprise and they were able to survive unscathed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Come with us.” As soon as they reached there, Sirzechs ordered and they all teleported to the Capital City of New Lilith Lucifer’s castle.</p><p><br></p><p>\"What is the situation?\" Sirzechs asked Grayfia as they made their way towards the Lucifer Office.</p><p><br></p><p>\"They have put barriers around the Phenex Broadcasting Station and taken everyone inside as hostages.\" She paused a bit before throwing a light glance at Serafall which was not missed by anyone. They had already gotten the information and Serafall was almost on a warpath, barely controlled by Sirzechs.</p><p><br></p><p>Grayfia took a deep breath and continued. \"They have also taken over the lecture of Helena Dantalion and everyone there.\"</p><p><br></p><p>The black haired Satan took a deep breath and controlled herself but one look at her face could tell someone how angry she was.</p><p><br></p><p>Her usual cheerful self was replaced by the one who had fought on the frontlines in the Civil War.</p><p><br></p><p>“What are their demands?” Sirzechs asked, as soon as he reached the office.</p><p><br></p><p>Ajuka had been in contact with him through communication circles and answered the question without pause.</p><p><br></p><p>“They want their words to be broadcasted and apparently want… justice. They said they are going to reveal something and they want us to judge people impartially.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Do you think this has something to do with the whole Youkai incident?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"It might be a part of the reason but their demands make me unsure. They could be trying to spread some kind of information to rile the public against us but even that is quite unlikely considering their tone. They seemed to have a different target this time.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And for this reason, they have the broadcast stations in their hands?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. They have given me an ultimatum that if I  were to interfere with the broadcast in any way, they will start taking down the hostages. I cannot risk the children from the other Pillar Houses. Several of them are lining up outside my office to solve this matter.” Ajuka sighed.</p><p><br></p><p>It was very rare for him to do so.</p><p><br></p><p>“What do we have on them?”</p><p><br></p><p>“All major Rating Game Players, opponents even. Each of them were associated with the Great King Faction but a few seemed to have some problems with them. I think it might be an internal issue although I am unsure about what it really is to force them this far. Even with the sanctions we had imposed on them, they still had plenty from their wins.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Can you break down their barriers?” Sirzechs asked. “We might be able to take them by surprise?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I cannot. The barriers are extremely strong and even I will need a long time to break through them. Not to mention, it would be too risky. The hostages are too high profile to take any unnecessary risks.”</p><p><br></p><p>\"How are they?\" Serafall asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Ajuka pointed towards a screen.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I managed to hack into the security cameras of the building to get a look at their actions.\"</p><p><br></p><p>He played footage from the time the attackers entered the building.</p><p><br></p><p>The scene of Helena Dantalion and Charlene Glasya-Labolas blasting through Ultimate Class Devils with such ease took them all by utter surprise. This kind of strength would have easily put them on par with the Satans and considering Charlene’s young age, she would even be considered a potential Super Devil.</p><p><br></p><p>He threw a look at the Satan Asmodeus but Falbium was just as surprised as the others.</p><p><br></p><p>Sensing the gazes of everyone, he answered. \"She had been helping the Dantalion girl with some experiments for the last few years. She had been following her methods of training to prove her hypothesis. But I didn't know she had grown this much.</p><p><br></p><p>They observed the scene of them surender due to the other party taking other children as hostages.</p><p><br></p><p>Sona was being kept safe by them which calmed down Serafall's temper a bit.</p><p><br></p><p>They asked Rias to describe the attack and Ajuka sent one of his peerage members to identify the bodies.</p><p><br></p><p>\"My Lords, the broadcast is about to start.\"</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Michael - </strong></p><p><br></p><p>He called the meeting of the other Seraphs and Great Seraphs as soon as he returned to Heaven.</p><p><br></p><p>The events of today were something they all deserved to know.</p><p><br></p><p>He sat in the Sixth Heaven, waiting for the arrival of his siblings.</p><p><br></p><p>The other Great Seraphs, Gabriel, Uriel and Raphael were the first ones to arrive. Ariel was the first of the Seraphs to arrive. The others soon followed along.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you really meet him?” As soon as the meeting started, Raphael asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone else looked at him, wanting to know the same answer.</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Who was it?” Uriel asked.</p><p><br></p><p>He knew how they would react to the name so he decided to take a different approach. “First, I want you all to see something.”</p><p><br></p><p>After gaining their attention, he addressed them again. “Prepare your hearts. Don’t let the scene waver them.”</p><p><br></p><p>He used the same spell to show the scenes he had seen.</p><p><br></p><p>As soon as the scene started he heard the gasps of several of his siblings.</p><p><br></p><p>“How?” Raphael asked but he could hear the quiver in the voice of his calmest sibling as he watched the fight in front of him with wide eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Keep watching.”</p><p><br></p><p>Several auras flared as the fight progressed and finally the scene came.</p><p><br></p><p>Lucifer stood with his sword drawn towards his Father. He could feel the rage of his siblings on his skin as they watched the scene.</p><p><br></p><p>But the very next instant, all their auras dispersed and several of them fell to their knees watching what happened next.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s impossible…”</p><p><br></p><p>“He would never…”</p><p><br></p><p>Gabriel was not even speaking but just wept constantly along with Jospiel. Others were standing there silently but not a single one was without tears.</p><p><br></p><p>Uriel was the one who broke the silence and questioned. “What happened to Father’s body?”</p><p><br></p><p>The very thought he had then… so he gave them the same answer which he had got.</p><p><br></p><p>“Keep watching.”</p><p><br></p><p>And they did, albeit reluctantly.</p><p><br></p><p>By the end, almost all of them were furiously releasing their powers, only somewhat holding back due to the fact that they were in the Sixth Heaven.</p><p><br></p><p>“One month. No, give me one week. We can track down that fiend’s location.” Raguel said. Others agreed too.</p><p><br></p><p>He waited for them to calm their minds.</p><p><br></p><p>After a short while, they quieted down but their anger could be felt in the holy power radiating in the atmosphere of the Sixth Heaven. Even the Great Seraphs were no exception.</p><p><br></p><p>“We are not attacking anyone.” He said quietly.</p><p><br></p><p>“What?”</p><p><br></p><p>“You can’t be serious?”</p><p><br></p><p>“How can you say that after watching that fiend…”</p><p><br></p><p>“That monster was about to desecrate Father’s body.”</p><p><br></p><p>Several of them retorted back ferociously. This was probably the first time they had reacted like this.</p><p><br></p><p>But he understood their emotions.</p><p><br></p><p>After all, he was barely holding himself back too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you not hear what was said to Rizevim? What end was predicted for him? Are you going to make him a liar?”</p><p><br></p><p>This caused many of them to pause but there was still anger.</p><p><br></p><p>“And what of him? He was the reason for all this in the first place?” Agiel argued.</p><p><br></p><p>“He did not kill Father. He didn’t start this war. We all heard the last words of Father. He had foreseen a calamity which could only be avoided by doing what he did. Helel had no part in it from the very start.” He reproached Agiel sternly and his brother looked down in sadness and anger but didn’t meet his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Michael’s eyes softened at this.</p><p><br></p><p>He knew what was happening. They were all angry, sad at what they had seen. But they didn’t have anyone to release their anger as the only place where they could rightfully do so was being taken away from them by him.</p><p><br></p><p>They were just lashing out.</p><p><br></p><p>“Brothers and Sisters. I know that all of you are angry. Sad and hurt at what we have seen. I am too. I know how much restraint it took me to not run directly to the Underworld and search for Rizevim myself and put him to justice… but… I choose to respect the last words, the wish of our brother.” He raised his hand, stopping anyone who was going to retort. “Helel is our brother. Always was and always will be. It is not only my thoughts but also our Father's last wish..”</p><p><br></p><p>This quieted them all so he continued on.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you all not remember the times when he was with us, in this very place, the brother you all cared for and looked up to? Have you all forgotten the love he had for Father?” Some of them bowed their heads while a look of reminiscence came upon several others.</p><p><br></p><p>“Helel and I were born far earlier than you all. The eldest of the siblings. I have seen him grow from a young child, learned beside him and grew older. From all the time I have spent with him, I can only say one thing… There hasn’t been another man who has loved Father more than him. Perhaps not even me. Even the reason for him leaving was to prove something to Father. Father was his entire reason for living. So….do you think he would ever think of killing him?” The whole place was silent. “Father passing away the way he did… was probably the greatest punishment anyone could ever give Helel. One which he would suffer through his entire life.”</p><p><br></p><p>He took a deep breath and continued again. “Even at his end, he chose to give up his life rather than let Father be insulted even in death. At least for this, put away your anger.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What does it even matter? It’s not like he is alive.”</p><p><br></p><p>His eyes twitched at this and at such a time, it was noticed by several of his siblings.</p><p><br></p><p>“What happened Michael? Who did you meet in today’s meeting?” Raphael, the sharpest of them all, was the first to ask.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Helel.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Sirzechs -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>It was a nightmare.</p><p><br></p><p>To begin with, the surprises thrown by the youngest Lucifer should have been an indication that today was just not his day.</p><p><br></p><p>He was thinking that Damien only had alliances with the Youkai and even then they were the major force behind them, but the truth was that… they were not only chummy with the Fallen, which almost seemed like an impossibility but were also allied with the Norse.</p><p><br></p><p>And this was not even mentioning their forces.</p><p><br></p><p>What they had initially assumed to be only a couple strong people turned out to be an entire faction with over a dozen beings, all beyond Satan Class and he still had doubts that they hadn’t seen everything of him.</p><p><br></p><p>Merlin Asmodeus, Celine of the Holy Flames, Gretel Lucifuge and… Ingvild Leviathan.</p><p><br></p><p>With what he knew about her, she might not hold any good feelings towards their government due to her past.</p><p><br></p><p>And every one of them were strong, already Super Devils or reaching infinitely close. Two of them could fight him to a standstill.</p><p><br></p><p>The others didn’t comment on it but he saw the ease with which she overtook Serafall’s outburst and dispersed the ice with a mere snap of her fingers.</p><p><br></p><p>And then Damien himself at the top. A verified Super Devil.</p><p><br></p><p>Such a force… he was not sure what to think of them anymore but he sincerely hoped that whatever happened, they didn't become enemies or this time, he wasn’t sure they would survive the oncoming war.</p><p><br></p><p>And just when he thought this day couldn’t get any more stressful, this happens. A rebellion of all damned things.</p><p><br></p><p>Serafall was on a warpath and was barely held back due to Sona being safe with Charlene and Helena.</p><p><br></p><p>He could understand her feelings too. He himself was enraged due to the attack on Rias. If not for the gifts she had gotten, she might as well have been in such a situation.</p><p><br></p><p>The houses with their family members held by the attackers as hostages were in a similar situation too.</p><p><br></p><p>His Peerage members were barely keeping them at bay.</p><p><br></p><p>Although he knew that they can't be kept aside for long.</p><p><br></p><p>So he walked out to address them all.</p><p><br></p><p>At the forefront was Archduke Agares and his followers while on the other side were the members of the Great King faction led by Zekram himself.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Lord Lucifer. You must stop their madness right now.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Our children's lives are at stake.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Many voices came one after the other.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, Archduke Agares took charge and walked to the front. “What is the situation with the attackers? Do you have any news or demands from them?”</p><p><br></p><p>He observed that several of the Great King faction were paying attention to it as well.</p><p><br></p><p>“They want their voices to be heard. Their only demand is that we do not stop the broadcast of their message till they are finished. If we do so, they will let go of the hostages.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You can’t be serious. They may be lying and might be trying to incite a riot and you want to give them an opportunity to do so?” Zekram chided.</p><p><br></p><p>“And what do you suggest I do? Deny them? Attack and risk every child and hostage under their control? Will you be taking responsibility for any of their actions?” He replied sarcastically.</p><p><br></p><p>The day’s stress was taking its toll on him and he was not in any mood for politics. Especially in a situation like this when the lives of so many people were at stake.</p><p><br></p><p>“And why should we take responsibility for the mismanagement of the Satans. If you don’t remember, several of these attackers are those upon whom you all had imposed sanctions…”</p><p><br></p><p>“For breaking treaties between several factions and over three dozen laws of the Devil factions as well as is our right.” Ajuka came from behind and stated clearly. “Or are you saying we should let people who break laws go free?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The laws which you all forced on everyone.”</p><p><br></p><p>“As were necessary to prevent another war. We warned them not to cause problems. They did so on their own and even then we negotiated their lives. What they got was exactly deserved by them all. But that is not a question here. The question is… are you telling us to leave the hostages to die?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am not…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then do you have any better suggestion?” he asked calmly but as a long time friend of his, Sirzechs could tell that Ajuka was extremely annoyed at this moment.</p><p><br></p><p>“Take down the barriers using force and take in the terrorists. Make an example of them.” Someone suggested but Ajuka didn’t even look at him and started straight at Zekram.</p><p><br></p><p>And sure enough the speaker was drowned by several auras of the ones whose relatives were held as hostages.</p><p><br></p><p>“The security of private events are not the responsibilities of the Satans, especially since the Pillar Houses themselves have kept any interference in those events out of our hands. So any failure of such events or the security related to such places… is totally on the organiser Pillars themselves and has nothing to do with the Satans. These are the laws made by the council you all are a part of… Section 12 Article 8. But you all seem to have conveniently forgotten this simple fact.” He began as he stared down each and every member of the Great King faction, making them cower.</p><p><br></p><p>“We Satans have a responsibility to run the government… not run at your orders to clean up all the messes you create.” He then turned towards Zekram. “And as you quite conveniently pointed out that two of the attackers are those who were sanctioned by us, lawfully might I add, I would also like to point out… those very people had an eight hour long meeting with you two days ago and left your place quite dissatisfied. And before you accuse me of spying on any Pillar House, I found this when I was investigating the recent activities of the attackers to find any clues about their motives. Could it be that you are pushing us, despite all the risk involved… just to clear out your mess?”</p><p><br></p><p>All eyes turned towards Zekram while the members of the Great King faction looked incensed.</p><p><br></p><p>“What are you insinuating Ajuka?”</p><p><br></p><p>“That would be Lord Beelzebub for you Zekram Bael. And I am insinuating exactly what you think I am. If you don’t have any good suggestions then I will have to ask you to sit there on the side and stop being a nuisance. We have work to do.” Ajuka pointed to the corner of the room.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>While in a normal situation he would have intervened from letting the matters escalate… this was anything but a normal situation. The fact that he doubted that Zekram might have some hand in this whole fiasco was also a major reason for this.</p><p><br></p><p>Ajuka however wasn’t done. “Oh and by the way, I also came across another piece of information. Five days ago, your butler had a meeting with two people working for a certain someone. Coincidentally, those very two people were involved in an attack on the Heiress of the Gremory House a few hours ago when all this started. They were following the Peerage members of the ones involved in this whole thing. So, I will have to ask you to call your Butler here for investigation.”</p><p><br></p><p>He too looked at the man closely, trying to see through any signs of weakness. He had known that the reforms they were pushing through would sooner or later be challenged by the old devils.</p><p><br></p><p>But if <em>this</em> was their way of attacking, then maybe he had really been too kind with them for far too long.</p><p><br></p><p>Zekram’s face looked emotionless as his aura began to surge. “Are you accusing me?”</p><p><br></p><p>But all this stopped midway as he was crushed by an icy cold burst of demonic power. The surroundings all froze as Serafall walked to the front. “Yes. I am accusing you of being in cahoots with the attackers? What of it?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you know who you are talking to, <em>girl</em>?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am talking to a potential criminal.” She replied, her voice equally chilly. “You all seem to have forgotten something very important here. We all sit in this position to ensure the peace of the Underworld for our families. For this reason alone we bear with your idiotic tantrums. But today, that line has been crossed. If something were to happen to my sister today, I will personally be investigating this matter and I will be using every means I can… and if, in doing so, I have to kill a house or two. Then so be it. It wouldn’t be the first time we had to do so for the peace of the Underworld.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Serafall…” he stepped forward to assuage her. Until things were proven, they still needed to keep their hands back just in case.</p><p><br></p><p>“What Sirzechs? Are you stopping me?” She retorted.</p><p><br></p><p>She was beyond angry since the time she had received information about Sona being held hostage.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am not doing anything of that sort. I am just telling you to calm down a bit. Losing your temper at such a time wouldn’t help anyone.” He turned towards Zekram. “Please call in your butler. It would be the easiest way to dispel any doubts of the people. We need any clue we can and if your butler has any possibility of being involved in this, then I apologise but we have to question him.”</p><p><br></p><p>The other houses were by now divided into two groups. One which was surrounding Zekram and glaring at them and the others who were glaring at Zekram, looking for any signs of deceit there.</p><p><br></p><p>“Very well, I will send for him.” The man sensed that he was at a disadvantage and acquiesced.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. If he really is a traitor, then he might escape. Have your other peerage members bring him in.” Serafall interrupted.</p><p><br></p><p>Zekram narrowed his eyes but still made the call.</p><p><br></p><p>“Will this be enough to satisfy you, <em>Lady Leviathan</em>?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I won’t be satisfied until my sister and every other child is out here safe and sound. Oh, and if your butler is to encounter any kind of accident before answering our questions… I will be taking you in for questioning personally.” She added on.</p><p><br></p><p>“Now that I have done my part, might I ask what exactly do you all plan on doing to handle this situation?” Zekram asked Serafall.</p><p><br></p><p>It was Ajuka who answered the question. “No. Anything we plan will only be privy to us. Revealing it to a crowd which might have any potential spies from the attackers will be a stupid move. Do remember that until today, they were also respectable members of society just like all of you. It’s not that we are doubting everyone, we just cannot afford to take any risks with so much at stake.”</p><p><br></p><p>Lord Phenex and Archduke Agares came to the front. “You all do what you want. We just want you to ensure the security of our children.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs stepped forward to reassure them. “I promise you that I will do everything in my power to bring them out safely.”</p><p><br></p><p>At this time, a message came. “My Lords, the broadcast has started.”</p><p><br></p><p>Some of them moved out while the rest all moved towards the halls of the Lucifer castle and watched the broadcast</p><p><br></p><p>Markus Amy was the one appearing on the screen.</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>My fellow Devils.</em>” He began. “<em>I know many of you think of us as terrorists while some of you might be wondering why we did what we did. The reason is simple. We are doing this because of betrayal. The betrayal of our trust.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>He narrowed his eyes at the comment and then observed the people present in the room. Some of the members of the Great King Faction looked slightly panicked and a few of them got up and left as well.</p><p><br></p><p>He eyed Ajuka and he nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>The man on the screen continued. “<em>If people think we are doing this due to sanctions imposed on us, then no. This is for a completely different reason. I am pretty sure everyone has noticed something common in every attacker. Each one of us is a prominent Rating Game player. Rating Games, the things which decide major decisions of the modern Devil society, be it business or promotions and even the popularity of devils. And we… the peak of this, decided to do this… because all of this is nothing but a lie.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>He watched not the screen but the people in the hall, and many people were looking panicked by now, getting up and leaving… including Zekram but Serafall wasn’t about to let him go.</p><p><br></p><p>She stood straight in his path, cutting his exit.</p><p><br></p><p>The broadcast continued. “<em>The entire Rating Game setup is being fixed by some people and even we were a part of it till recently.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>Ajuka was looking seriously at the broadcast, it taking a whole different turn than what they were expecting. After all, Ajuka had single handedly developed everything about the Rating Games himself, including the Evil Pieces. He was the sole and top authority regarding these matters here.</p><p><br></p><p>The man on the screen put a hand on his chest and pulled out something.</p><p><br></p><p>A Chess Piece.</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>That was…</p><p><br></p><p>A King Piece.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at Ajuka who was frowning heavily at the scene. Ajuka summoned a magic circle and communicated something in it.</p><p><br></p><p>The members of the Great King faction had panic and outrage on their faces, clear for everyone to see.</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>This is a King Piece. The fabled sixteenth piece of the Evil Piece set. But what it does is not reincarnate others but rather only increase their power.</em>” For a demonstration, he pushed the piece into the chest of another Devil beside him and his aura rose. “<em>The difference between the power granted by the King Piece and other pieces is heaven and earth. One King Piece can grant anything between a ten times to one hundred times increase in power.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>Uproars broke in the crowd at his reveal.</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>This piece can make even a common High Class Devil measure up to someone like Grayfia Lucifuge and Serafall Leviathan.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>One of Ajuka’s peerage members had arrived and whispered something in his ears making his frown deeper.</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>So, the hopes and dreams of the young and new devils who are thinking of making it big through Rating Games is all a lie. They have been and will keep getting crushed by those of less talent and power than them. It has been this way till now. Several houses were run out of business. Several talented Devils crushed. The entire Rating Game sport was fixed with these King Pieces. In fact, six of the top ten Rating Game Players are all King Piece users. And all this is done by… The Great King faction and Zekram Bael.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>The crowd erupted.</p><p><br></p><p>“Liars.”</p><p><br></p><p>“These terrorists…”<br><br></p><p>Several looks were thrown at the man who sat there unphased. He merely looked at the crowd. “Are you going to believe some random slander by a bunch of terrorists?”</p><p><br></p><p>And he was right about this.</p><p><br></p><p>Even if they did doubt him, everything was circumstantial. They could do nothing with this information.</p><p><br></p><p>And thus he looked at the broadcast, hoping that they would bring out some kind of incriminating evidence against Zekram Bael.</p><p><br></p><p>Sure enough, he got some good enough evidence.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“Now many of you must be wondering how something of this scale could remain hidden for this long. The answer is simple. Several people found out about it over the centuries… but… they were all eliminated by the Great King faction. I myself killed half a dozen of such people.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>He stood dumbfounded at the reveal as the man on the screen continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Some were killed directly while some were framed for some crime and executed. Two Pillar Houses were declared extinct because of this secret, just to preserve the profits of some greedy devils. The most recent example being Cleria Belial, the younger cousin of the Emperor, Diehauser Belial, one of the few players who doesn’t use the King Piece.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>Cleria Belial. He quickly reminded himself. She was accused of colluding with the church and passing sensitive information to her lover, an exorcist from the Church.</p><p><br></p><p>The Church had denied it and both were executed by their respective sides. The whole thing had been unusually fast paced for such a high profile case.</p><p><br></p><p>Markus Amy provided the proof of several cases including the case of Cleria Belial over the broadcast.</p><p><br></p><p>He sensed an aura flaring in the room and saw Lord Belial walking up to Zekram. One of his peerage members went ahead to stop anything bad from happening while Zekram himself prepared to counter but couldn’t move much under Serafall’s eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Unexpectedly, the man didn’t use any spells but rather punched Zekram Bael right on his face, throwing him to the walls and then turned to him.</p><p><br></p><p>“I wish to file a murder case against Zekram Bael and his colleagues for the murder of my niece. I do hope you will handle the case properly, and not consider any familial relations between you and the Bael House.”</p><p><br></p><p>The last part was said with an edge to his voice.</p><p><br></p><p>“We would never…” he began to explain but the man raised a hand.</p><p><br></p><p>“I had pleaded the case of my niece to be investigated several times and yet nothing was done. She was sentenced to death and the Satans also gave their verdicts. And now I find all of that was a lie. Don’t tell me to believe you because I have no reason to. Prove yourself. Just like Lady Leviathan has broken all etiquette when her sister’s life is at stake and I am sure you would have done something similar.” he flinched at the accusation because somewhere at the bottom of his heart, he knew that the man was not lying. “Someone at your position needs to understand that the lives of other people’s relatives are also important. After all, the reason the previous Satans’s descendants lost the throne was quite similar.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Lord Belial.” Ajuka tried interrupting.</p><p><br></p><p>“No Lord Beelzebub. I am just stating facts. You people failed my niece and failed my House. I am in full right to say the words I did.”</p><p><br></p><p>He took a deep breath and addressed the man. “I give you my word Lord Belial that I will find and personally punish each and everyone responsible for this, even if they are related to me.” He added the last part looking at Zekram who merely narrowed his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are someone carrying the name of Lucifer. I hope you understand the significance of giving your word to someone.” Lord Belial added before turning and leaving the scene.</p><p><br></p><p>The reminder made a face appear in front of him as well as the words spoken by him.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“The current Devil’s Government is a ship full of holes and I… will not take my people onto a sinking ship.”</em></p><p><br></p><p>His attention was only diverted by Markus Amy’s words.</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>And this is not the only skeleton in his closet. Today, we are going to unearth as many of them as we can before we get taken down and meet the same end as the ones before us.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>He suddenly had a very bad feeling in his gut but the time didn’t allow him to act on it as they had a lot of work to do. First of all, he ordered his peerage members to take Zekram Bael and the ones whose names had come out to be taken in for investigation. Serafall herself took care of this order.</p><p><br></p><p>But it seemed as if they were not going to get any rest.</p><p><br></p><p>The scene on the broadcast changed to a familiar place and all of them were attracted towards the screen again.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Gretel –</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Cleria appeared behind her and began her report. \"Our people are in position to take over the next area. We just need the signal.\"</p><p><br></p><p>She could sense the difference in the voice of the woman and it was understandable too as she was finally getting her name cleared. There was finally hope to see justice done by her.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Do it.\" She gave the signal to her.</p><p><br></p><p>Barriers rose up all around the area of the Bael estate as three King Piece users and their peerage members rushed in.</p><p><br></p><p>Their actions were being broadcasted throughout the underworld.</p><p><br></p><p>Everything had been planned from the very start.</p><p><br></p><p>The information about Zekram Bael’s butler as well as the meeting between Markus Amy and his fellow Rating Game player with Zekram was revealed to Ajuka not by his investigation… but rather due to their manipulations.</p><p><br></p><p>If Zekram thought he was the only one who could play the Old Satan faction and the current government against each other to reap the profit, he was dead wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the reactions of the other side was predicted and several measures were taken to keep them in check.</p><p><br></p><p>Sona Sitri was taken hostage to keep Serafall Leviathan and other Satans from making any moves… but she was also under the <em>protection</em> of Charlene and Helena and <em>coincidentally</em> all the cameras in the place were active to allow them to keep an eye on the entire situation to keep them from doing anything rash.</p><p><br></p><p>They had even placed a couple of their supporting House Heads among the crowd who fanned the flames against Zekram during the meeting with the Satans, making them take action.</p><p><br></p><p>Gretel sat in front of the screen and watched the proceedings.</p><p><br></p><p>The three attacking teams entered the Bael estate and immediately encountered resistance in the form of the Peerage members of the Bael Head. However, they were easily taken care of by the attackers, especially the kings who were boosted by the King Piece.</p><p><br></p><p>\"<em>There is a variable in the plan.</em>\" A message came to her from the other side.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Yes?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"<em>Venelana Gremory is visiting the Bael House for some reason.</em>\" Cleria relayed the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>Her?</p><p><br></p><p>But there was no time to change the plans right now.</p><p><br></p><p>“Try not to harm her.”</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Okay. I will inform Alicia, Victoria and Ophelia to take care.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>She too got to work as both sides got busy fighting.</p><p><br></p><p>Grey Mist spread out from her hands and seeped into the ground under the Bael Territory, directly under the palace of the Great King.</p><p><br></p><p>She could feel everything through her connection to her Sacred Gear. The grey mist was moulded into a dimensional gateway and connected to a separate dimension they had already connected beforehand.</p><p><br></p><p>The gateway was then connected to the basement of the Bael Estate.</p><p><br></p><p>With all the preparations complete, she threw one last look at the place and teleported away.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Zekram Bael -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He watched as everything was going wrong and yet several things didn’t make sense.</p><p><br></p><p>Those rebels.</p><p><br></p><p>He could barely understand the two who were told to return their King Pieces rebelling. After all, they were given the option to pass on the pieces to their children and keep the influence of their houses.</p><p><br></p><p>Was their pride or attachment to their power so great that they would ruin everything, even the reputation of their houses and its futures for that?</p><p><br></p><p>But even that had a reason.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, for the life of him, he couldn’t understand why the other four rebelled all of a sudden.</p><p><br></p><p>Were they afraid that they would be sidelined as well?</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>Something of this level of planning couldn’t be done in a few months, let alone a few days. This was something which had been planned for a long time.</p><p><br></p><p>But who was behind them? As far as he knew them, none of them had what it took to plan all this.</p><p><br></p><p>So who could it be?</p><p><br></p><p>The current Satans?</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>They might make moves but this was not their style.</p><p><br></p><p>His butler’s and informants of the Old Satan faction were revealed so maybe… those Satan Descendants?</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, it’s not like there weren’t some other suspicious people who could do it too.</p><p><br></p><p>Diehauser Belial.</p><p><br></p><p>Cleria Belial’s case was dangerous because of the people associated with her.</p><p><br></p><p>It could be his political rivals.</p><p><br></p><p>Agares.</p><p><br></p><p>But then again, with the number of spies he had with everyone, it was very unlikely that they could pull something like this off without alerting him one way or another.</p><p>Or was it other factions?</p><p><br></p><p>No. That was very unlikely.</p><p><br></p><p>He never put himself in front of other factions.</p><p><br></p><p>The new Satans were there for that.</p><p><br></p><p>The only viable option he could think of is Rizevim.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe… but then why would he make a move all of a sudden?<br><br></p><p>And these brats were being guided so easily as well.</p><p><br></p><p>Just as he was thinking about these, the scene on the screen shifted to a familiar place.</p><p><br></p><p>The Bael Mansion?</p><p><br></p><p>Similar barriers rose around the entire mansion as several Devils rushed in to take over the mansion.</p><p><br></p><p>The guards of the place reacted as expected but against the King Piece users like Beedeze Abaddon and Charles Shax, they proved to be quite short.</p><p><br></p><p>It would have been far different if he had been there personally. He possessed two King Pieces at hand for such emergencies to defend the Bael House.</p><p><br></p><p>That said, with him in this place, it was not at all possible.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the Satans.</p><p><br></p><p>“I request assistance for the Bael House. Whatever may be the case, can still be left till everything is proved but if the Bael House dies, it will be all on you people.”</p><p><br></p><p>Several people cried out in outrage at this.</p><p><br></p><p>He noticed that it was mostly the newly instated Pillars who were making the noise.</p><p><br></p><p>The reason why he had let them be instated was because they couldn’t have caused any waves. The entire economy of the Underworld was already in his grasp. He could easily turn them against those brats and teach them their place.</p><p><br></p><p>But…</p><p><br></p><p>“A few minutes ago, Lord Bael requested assistance and we have already sent people to act as reinforcements. Unfortunately the barriers they are using are not something we have been able to crack. Even Ajuka would need at least two days to crack something like this so I apologise if we cannot support them faster.” Sirzechs answered. “For now, we can only wait until we are able to crack their barriers.”</p><p><br></p><p>He clenched his fists but kept quiet due to the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>The scene continued and the only ones holding the attack were the current Lord and surprisingly Venelana. It was then he remembered that he had called her to discuss the position of the Gremory and leave a warning.</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t know that she had gone there today.</p><p><br></p><p>This ought to bring Sirzechs in line.</p><p><br></p><p>As expected, he looked visibly disturbed at the sight of Venelana.</p><p><br></p><p>The surprising thing was that the attackers, specifically, Charles Shax went ahead to negotiate with Venelana rather than continue fighting.</p><p><br></p><p>They offered to let the ones uninvolved, go if they surrendered and not harm even a single person.</p><p><br></p><p>“Our goal is to show the crimes of the Bael House to the world. We do not wish for unnecessary bloodshed. The hostages are only to prevent us from being taken down before we can achieve our goal.” Charles argued.</p><p><br></p><p>They brought the captured wife of the current head and his son and he could see Venelana struggling before finally giving up with a sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>Useless.</p><p><br></p><p>All of them, useless.</p><p><br></p><p>She was brought aside and soon the current head was also captured and locked together.</p><p><br></p><p>The attackers entered the mansion.</p><p><br></p><p>He wasn’t too worried about what they might find inside as most of the important things were hidden under several spells. Even the safes were under several seals which would destroy the contents if opened by anyone other than him.</p><p><br></p><p>And sure enough, one of them found one of his safes.</p><p><br></p><p>The next scene however completely blew his mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Two women, the bishops of Charles Shax took charge of the situation and one of them easily unlocked the safe. The entire sealing formation fell apart.</p><p><br></p><p>The other woman closed her eyes and stood in the middle of the room as she turned around, directly walking towards the next safe.</p><p><br></p><p>That was…</p><p><br></p><p>A Valac?</p><p><br></p><p>It was exactly how a Valac uses their Seeker’s Eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked around and sure enough several others had recognised it as well. The head of the Valac house was also looking at the woman.</p><p><br></p><p>“Lord Valac… I might be wrong but that was your Clan’s Trait. But I didn’t know someone of your clan had joined Charles Shax’s peerage.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I… don’t know.” The man himself looked genuinely surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>“There is no user of the Seeker’s Eye who is as proficient as that woman on the screen. Those safes were hidden under several spells and even for someone with Seeker’s Eyes, it must be extremely difficult to pinpoint something like that. If it was actually Seeker’s Eye, then she might be the strongest user of the Skill yet.” Ajuka said and while he too agreed with it too.</p><p><br></p><p>Charles Shax… was he hiding such a piece from everyone?</p><p><br></p><p>Seeker’s Eye was probably the most useful Skill to have by anyone’s side. A reason why anyone carrying that trait was highly wanted by everyone.</p><p><br></p><p>He too had tried to arrange a marriage between one of his descendants a few generations ago with a Valac but unfortunately, the man died in the Civil War without producing any descendants.</p><p><br></p><p>To think another one was hiding right under his nose…</p><p><br></p><p>But at this time, she was proving to be the biggest nemesis of his as the woman found each and every one of his safes one after another.</p><p><br></p><p>The bigger surprise however was the second woman who was able to open them all without making a single mistake.</p><p><br></p><p>One by one all the safes he could recall were found and opened.</p><p><br></p><p>Those traitors made copies of the documents and broadcasted everything.</p><p><br></p><p>It was then that he noticed something odd.</p><p><br></p><p>Some of the things broadcasted were not things he had kept there.</p><p><br></p><p>They were framing him for different things.</p><p><br></p><p>But before he could point it out, he was attacked by someone.</p><p><br></p><p>He barely defended but another attack threw him aside.</p><p><br></p><p>The attackers were quickly apprehended and he was secured but also bound.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sirzechs, what is the meaning of this?”</p><p><br></p><p>“You will be under arrest until all the documents are verified. If even a quarter of the documents are true…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Those are not mine. I am being framed.” he shouted but was trapped inside the barrier.</p><p><br></p><p>Ajuka.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Chysis Gremory -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She looked at Zekram who was banging at the barriers, claiming to have been framed.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, she doubted him for several of those crimes and even knew that he had committed some of them directly or indirectly but… they had a policy of mutual non interference.</p><p><br></p><p>Zekram had knowledge of everyone’s hidden skeletons and that was not something anyone wanted to try testing out.</p><p><br></p><p>But this…</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t know what had gone on between him and these rebels but she knew one thing for sure.</p><p><br></p><p>After today, the Bael House will be ruined.</p><p><br></p><p>Even now, several of their peerages were trying to calm down the public and hundreds of Rating Game players from going on riots.</p><p><br></p><p>Not to mention the other Pillar Houses who were plotted against or had their members killed by the Great King faction.</p><p><br></p><p>Was it really Rizevim making a move?</p><p><br></p><p>If so… then she could only pray to the Satans to save the Underworld.</p><p><br></p><p>She watched the screen with bated breath, wondering what would come out next.</p><p><br></p><p>The Valac woman found another direction but this time there were no safes or hidden cases.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a door or more precisely, a gateway.</p><p><br></p><p>The other woman tried to unlock it but this one took her quite long but when it was opened, it revealed a passageway to what looked like a separate dimension.</p><p><br></p><p>Charles Shax walked in, followed by the two women and the audience all saw the scene.</p><p><br></p><p>It looked like a lab.</p><p><br></p><p>Equipment filled every corner of the place.</p><p><br></p><p>They looked around and suddenly… the one recording everything stopped and several gasps sounded from the group.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s…”</p><p><br></p><p>The camera fell from his hand and lay on the ground for a moment before it was picked up with shaking hands and pointed at a glass cylinder…</p><p><br></p><p>In there lay a figure.</p><p><br></p><p>As her brain registered what she was seeing… her mind went blank and she forgot to breathe.</p><p><br></p><p>The crowd around her as well as the Satans all stood up from their places and even Zekram became dead still in shock at the sight of the figure.</p><p><br></p><p>“It couldn’t be…”</p><p><br></p><p>“But how…”</p><p><br></p><p>At this time, she felt a tug at her sleeves and looked at Rias who was looking at the scene curiously.</p><p><br></p><p>“Who is she?”</p><p><br></p><p>It was Zeo who answered her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Lilith.”</p><p><br></p><p>_________________________________x__________________________________________________________________x_________________________________</p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am finally back from my break.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Things are starting to get heated up as Damien started his plan.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>So many things happened in this chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Michael and Heaven's top brass know that the Devil is back.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The Satans are on the edge because of the hostages.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Serafall is downright murderous there.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Zekram is getting screwed and still doesn’t know who is screwing him.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Poor Rizevim getting blamed while not even doing anything.

This time it was Lucifer, not Helel.</p><p><br></p><p>I could tell the difference.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, I understood what Azazel and Shemhazai meant when they said they were not the same people.</p><p><br></p><p>The one standing in front of me held the same face as mine but his eyes, they made even me feel the wrongness of his very existence, and I was a Devil.</p><p><br></p><p>Comparing this with the Helel that I had been seeing all this time, Yeah, any sane person would call them different.</p><p><br></p><p>Helel had emotions, all kinds of emotions,  love, anger, kindness, ruthlessness, compassion, as well as pride. All of them mashed up in one body to make one being. When I watched his memories, I could feel the charisma of the guy. His actions had a meaning. He cared. Yes. That was the word for it.</p><p><br></p><p>But Lucifer, Lucifer didn’t care.</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>One look in his eyes and it was clear.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t think there would ever come a day when I would say this, but Rizevim was correct when describing him then.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. This guy was capital E Evil.</p><p><br></p><p>With him there were three other people. Two men and one woman. All Devils with twelve wings. The original Satans.</p><p><br></p><p>And against them stood a figure who was honestly blinding.</p><p><br></p><p>It was as if he was the personification of light and holy.</p><p><br></p><p>This was my first time seeing him and yet I didn’t need anyone to tell me who he was. I just knew.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, anyone who encounters him would not need to be introduced. One look at him would make his identity pop up in their minds.</p><p><br></p><p>Father…</p><p><br></p><p>The feeling was very nostalgic and yet so alien.</p><p><br></p><p>It was like I had experienced this all before but at the same time I was seeing all this for the first time.</p><p><br></p><p>The scene in front of me was the fight from the Great War. The fight between the leaders of both sides. The final fight between them.</p><p><br></p><p>For the first time since I started watching the memories, I didn’t know what to say. I knew that my soul was merged with the previous Lucifer’s soul but this was probably the second time his feelings were so… so heavy. So contradictory.</p><p><br>With every attack that <em>He</em> landed on the other three, a part of me growled in anger. It was the feeling of seeing a close friend getting hurt.</p><p><br></p><p>But…</p><p><br></p><p>Every time a blow was struck on <em>him</em>, another part of me wanted to rip the hands which dared to do such blasphemy.</p><p><br></p><p>It was as if two parts of me were warring against each other, as if they were trying and tearing my very being in two. Unlike the other times, where I could just watch the scene as an audience, this time though, I could feel everything myself.</p><p><br></p><p>And it was not a good feeling at all.</p><p><br></p><p>The fight continued and I could finally see the powers of the leaders.</p><p><br></p><p>I could understand how Asmodeus could use his flames to such a level and Leviathan could manipulate water. Even her ‘Sea Serpent of the End’ form.</p><p><br></p><p>Ingvild might be stronger than her in raw power but she was an absolute master when it came to skills.</p><p><br></p><p>Beelzebub, bringing chaos with his bees. The Lord of Flies was indeed an appropriate title. Everything decayed wherever his flies went.</p><p><br></p><p>And despite my personal feelings towards him, Lucifer was an absolute beast when it came to fighting.</p><p><br></p><p>I was sure that I could easily defeat him with my current level of power but if we were to fight at an equal level, there was a good chance that he would kill me.</p><p><br></p><p>And last but absolutely not the least… <em>him</em>.</p><p><br></p><p>Each one of his attacks were carving out mountains and valleys in the Underworld, erasing all traces of demonic power from the surroundings, purging all evil. Even when his light erased all creation, it felt… healing.</p><p><br></p><p>The longer I observed, the more I learned. The more I could see.</p><p><br></p><p>A few things were becoming obvious.</p><p><br></p><p>He was holding back against Lucifer.</p><p><br></p><p>There were two times that he could have struck him down and without the Denial of the Divine, the other three would have easily been dealt with but he held back. But he didn’t do so…</p><p><br></p><p>And he was not the only one.</p><p><br></p><p>Lucifer was holding back too</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>He was actually hesitating to actually land a blow on him.</p><p><br></p><p>He defended and countered but never actually tried to attack him for real, to kill him. It was very minute. People who don’t know him might not even recognise it. Maybe I did because I knew his Skills. I knew what he <em>could</em> but was not doing there.</p><p><br></p><p>And then something happened.</p><p><br></p><p>He struck Asmodeus. A Slash from the waist to the collar bone, almost bisecting the demon in two halves.</p><p><br></p><p>The demon didn't stand a chance and was killed in moments.</p><p><br></p><p>And that's when things grew serious.</p><p><br></p><p>Lucifer's attacks became more lethal, the prior hesitation diminishing greatly. Beelzebub and Leviathan became more crazy. Trading blows for blows.</p><p><br></p><p>Wounds started appearing on <em>his</em> body too.</p><p><br></p><p>But he didn't back down.</p><p><br></p><p>Another attack struck true. It was Beelzebub this time. His spear ran straight through Lord of Flies' heart. Leviathan took this opportunity to attack him and sent him flying towards a nearby mountain. But not before getting a stab to her kidney.</p><p><br></p><p>Lucifer followed and in that window of opportunity, pointed his sword directly at his heart ending the fight.</p><p><br></p><p>Both sides were bloody from the war.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why now? Just why did you start the war now?” Lucifer shouted.</p><p><br></p><p>There was immense frustration in his voice.</p><p><br></p><p>“You were not even paying attention to what we were doing all this time and now suddenly you want to clear everything. Wipe all of us off to clear the records. Are we just that….are we really so worthless compared to those filthy clay dolls of yours….”</p><p><br></p><p>*<em>Shunk</em>*</p><p><br></p><p>All his words were stopped.</p><p><br></p><p>Wide eyes looked at the tip of his sword embedded in the heart of the person in front of them.</p><p><br></p><p>I stood there, absolutely stunned.</p><p><br></p><p>What?</p><p><br></p><p>He moved on his own….and let the sword pierce him.</p><p><br></p><p>*<em>Clang</em>*</p><p><br></p><p>The sword fell down from his hands and Lucifer looked at the scene in utter horror as he stumbled, falling to the ground on his back.</p><p><br></p><p><em>He</em> stumbled forward, right to his face, spear in his hand and….let it fall to the ground and….hugged him.</p><p><br></p><p>The man froze.</p><p><br></p><p>I stood there watching something which no one else alive probably knew.</p><p><br></p><p>The last words of God.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Flashback Ends -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Master?” I heard Gretel’s voice as I opened my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you alright?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Why wouldn’t I be?” I asked, surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>She pointed towards my cheeks and I took a moment to notice that my cheeks were wet.</p><p><br></p><p>Tears?</p><p><br></p><p>Huh.</p><p><br></p><p>“Maybe drinking wine from the Graal was not a good idea.” I smiled wryly. But I knew more than anyone else that the scene I had seen did affect me.</p><p><br></p><p>I wasn’t even the man’s son and I was feeling annoyed by this whole thing. I really wanted to find the last relic as soon as I could, just to have a good talk with him.</p><p><br></p><p>She placed a hand on my shoulder and I gripped it with one of my own.</p><p><br></p><p>“Gretel.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Master.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I think I know what the purpose of our faction is.” I said. The scenes I had seen gave me direction.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes?”</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled. “I will tell you later. For now, we have a guest to meet.” I looked down from the second floor of the club at the newly arrived guests while hiding my aura under my ‘Prince of Lies’ magic. Azazel was going to have the time of his life.</p><p><br></p><p>With all the pieces in place, I decided to go along with the main plan.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the other side of the room. Cleria was there with her peerage.</p><p><br></p><p>“Call everyone. It’s time to start ‘Operation Regicide’.”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded then paused a bit to ask. “Who will be leading the whole thing?”</p><p><br></p><p>I got up and raised and made a hand sign. A Shadow Clone appeared behind me and took the seat.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Azazel -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Is this one of your pranks, Azazel?” Michael asked as he looked around the place. Following him were two people. The seven foot giant always made him feel he was not human. The power radiating from him even when he was not doing anything certainly didn’t really shout out human.</p><p><br></p><p>To be honest, if Father had still been around, this man would surely have attained the title of a Saint or maybe even a Seraph like Metatron. He certainly deserved the rank.</p><p><br></p><p>Vasco Strada was a man he could honour. Not even his enemies could deny this fact.</p><p><br></p><p>The other one was the wielder of Excalibur Galatine, an up and coming exorcist, David Cero.</p><p><br></p><p>“My prank? No. I am a guest here just like you. Today’s party was organised by someone else? Come on in.”</p><p><br></p><p>He raised an eyebrow but didn’t say anything and quietly followed him nonetheless.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is going on here, Azazel?” He asked, this time more serious.</p><p><br></p><p>“Just the party for the opening of a bar.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A bar named Hell? And that message for the address? ‘Straight up from the church.’”</p><p><br></p><p>He chuckled. “That! Was a good one, right?”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Michael -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He let out a sigh mentally. Talking to Azazel was always like this. Getting a straight answer was never an option.</p><p><br></p><p>Today, he came here because a letter was sent to Ariel, who was stationed in the Vatican to watch over the Church.</p><p><br></p><p>It held an invitation to this place.</p><p><br></p><p>The surprising thing about the letter was the Holy Power on it. The same Holy Power which had appeared a while ago, the one from one of his brothers who appeared near the shroud recently</p><p><br></p><p>He came personally because there was still hope that he could meet and find out about them. Honestly, he wanted to come alone but Ariel sent two exorcists to accompany him, with the intent of showing the good side of the church.</p><p><br></p><p>Azazel, opening the gate, had just thrown cold water all over it.</p><p><br></p><p>Was this perhaps a sudden meeting to ask about the changes in Heaven and the Church?</p><p><br></p><p>“Are those?” He looked at the gathering in front of him.</p><p><br></p><p>The Norse, the Youkai and the Fallen Angel. There were even Devils.</p><p><br></p><p>“As I said. It’s not my party. Take a seat. The host will be appearing soon.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Michael.” The young Lucifer got up to greet him, followed by the Leviathan.</p><p><br></p><p>Odin merely gave him a nod. The relations with the Norse had been cold at best since that incident. The fact that Bryndhildr was sending him a blatant glare was evident of it. Odin’s reaction was tame compared to that. To be honest, the old God would have declared war if he was in his younger days. His age brought him great wisdom.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sirzechs, Serafall.” he greeted but noticed an odd reaction on their faces. “Is something the matter?”</p><p><br></p><p>The red haired devil shook his head. “I didn’t know you were invited too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh?”</p><p><br></p><p>Azazel interrupted. “Probably because of the host.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And who’s the host?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Family.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Before he could ask anything, a person appeared on the stage. He saw the one at the front and felt a twinge in his heart. Celine. That child… After her unfortunate fall, they had thought she had perished or perhaps… chosen to end herself.</p><p><br></p><p>An end which several Angels had chosen over the ages than live as a Fallen.</p><p><br></p><p>Uriel hadn’t spoken a word.</p><p><br></p><p>Not when she had Fallen… and not even when she had gone off the radar completely.</p><p><br></p><p>But his change in behaviour was visible when he begged to be allowed to personally handle the assignments against any Fallen Angels till the end of the war.</p><p><br></p><p>A major reason for Azazel ending the war early was because Uriel alone had burned seventeen legions of Fallen Angels in the war.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone was worried that he would fall but he miraculously held on.</p><p><br></p><p>The reason he gave was that he couldn’t protect his daughter and his duty prevented him from helping her so the least he could do was make sure none of the other Angels faced the same unfortunate fate.</p><p><br></p><p>It did help.</p><p><br></p><p>The Fallen had been shaken beyond anything and completely stopped such ambushes. It also made them the first to back out from the Great War.</p><p><br></p><p>“Celine.” He whispered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Uriel would have finally calmed down.” Shemhazai said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes… yes he would.” No doubt, he would. “Where was she? Did she join you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No she didn’t. She was captured by the old Satan faction and was imprisoned. She was freed along with several other Fallen Angels, a few years ago by someone.”</p><p><br></p><p>He frowned. “I thought we had agreed to free the prisoners of war.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We had no idea that they had kept people with them. You already know how the relations between us are.” Serafall hurriedly tried to correct.</p><p><br></p><p>He turned towards Azazel and questioned. “Were there any prisoners from Heaven?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, calm down. There were no pure Angels in captivity. All of them had fallen hundreds of years ago. We didn’t even know who were captured as pure angels. They are Fallen now.”</p><p><br></p><p>He closed his eyes and offered a prayer for his brothers and sisters who had suffered. Another example of his mistakes.</p><p><br></p><p>Azazel passed him a glass of juice and he took a sip, trying to moisten his dried up throat. \"Who freed them?\"</p><p><br></p><p>A voice came from behind him answering his question.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Me.\"</p><p><br></p><p>He turned back… and spit out everything in his mouth.</p><p><br></p><p>A flash of light and a clicking sound followed.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>– Diahauser Belial –</strong></p><p><br></p><p>It was finally time.</p><p><br></p><p>He had waited for this for years, a chance to clear his sister’s name who had to live as a dead person and even then was known as a traitor and a criminal, all because of the greed and faults of some older people on the council.</p><p><br></p><p>“Diehauser. The orders are for you to not show your face. We are to put all the blame on the ones involved in the King Piece scandal. This whole scene has to look like an internal dispute.” Cleria repeated again.</p><p><br></p><p>“I know.” How could he not when had gone over the plan hundreds of times to clear out any variables. Not only him but Merlin and even Damien had done the same. “Have they captured the rest of the King Piece users?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. As of twelve minutes ago, Roygun Belphegor was caught and interrogated. She gave a statement that she only accepted the King Pieces because she was interested in the Rating Games. She was close to you so I ordered her to be kept aside till after I consult with you.”</p><p><br></p><p>She… he let out a visible sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>He could actually see her doing so. Roygun has always been crazy about Rating Games.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, he wasn’t the one incharge of the mission.</p><p><br></p><p>“What did He say?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Master is willing to give her a way out if she testifies against them and give us all the proof of the Rating Game scam and the ones involved in it. He just wants your opinion.”</p><p><br></p><p>His opinion?</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly he thought of something and understood.</p><p><br></p><p>A test.</p><p><br></p><p>Damien had appointed him incharge of the whole mission till now and only came himself to watch over the final step when Zekram’s involvement with Lilith came out.</p><p><br></p><p>Since he was the leader, what kind of decision would he take?</p><p><br></p><p>Would he put his acquaintance above others?</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>If he did so, how would he be any better than those he was fighting against?</p><p><br></p><p>He let out a deep breath and spoke. “Along with confessing everything publicly, and providing testimonies against those responsible, she will also be banned from leading a team in a Rating Game… ever. Apart from that, she will have to provide half of her assets as compensation for the training and upliftment of low level and less privileged Rating Game players who have been losing their opportunities due to the King Piece users. Request Master to add these to her sentence too in exchange of leniency.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. I will.”</p><p><br></p><p>He conjured a magic circle to connect to other members and gave the orders.</p><p><br></p><p>“Start the plan.”</p><p><br></p><p>In front of them was the largest broadcast station of the Underworld.</p><p><br></p><p>He used a Transformation Technique to change his look into that of one of their insiders in the Old Satan faction, a cadre who was captured and made to sign a loyalty contract so even if they found a link, it would be to the Old Satan faction and not them. Even his Clan Trait was transferred to him to solidify the disguise.</p><p><br></p><p>Those contracts made Diehauser feel chills down his spine.</p><p><br></p><p>To think someone was capable of such a thing.</p><p><br></p><p>It was literally the term 'Deal with the Devil' personified in terms of a contract.</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, what would someone expect from <em>his</em> reincarnation? The only thing which Diehauser was glad about was that unlike the rumours he had heard about their creator, Damien wasn't insane.</p><p><br></p><p>He had taught the boy enough to know of his core personality.</p><p><br></p><p>Their spies had already infiltrated the place and were aware of everything ahead of time. So as soon as the orders came, they got ready.</p><p><br></p><p>A barrier was erected over the place. They had already placed markers in the walls of the building, strong enough to prevent the entry of those Super Devils. The building's security spells were shut off at the same time.</p><p><br></p><p>The occupants of the building were alerted but it was already too late. His team had begun the mission. </p><p><br></p><p>He took the lead and started taking down the guards by himself. Cleria had surrounded the building with her team members in disguise.</p><p><br></p><p>They couldn’t put up much of a fight anyways. The strongest of them being Reven Phenex, the second son of the Phenex House but they had already prepared for it too.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the King Piece users, Markus Amy, engaged him with his peerage members. He was one of those who had been captured during the attack on Kyoto and had to pay large compensation to the Youkai. The biggest cause of their dissatisfaction was the decision of Ajuka Beelzebub to ban them from the Rating Games.</p><p><br></p><p>They were asked to return their King Pieces. Even his request to pass on the King Piece to his son was rejected. They were given a period of time to return the pieces so that they could use it to retire and leave the public eye so that their change in strength was not noticed causing doubts.</p><p><br></p><p>Within twelve minutes of the barrier being erected, the building was under their complete control, all the security personnel subdued and locked up.</p><p><br></p><p>He put the information up for broadcast.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Damien -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Master, the first part of the attack was successful. The information is being broadcasted all over the Underworld.</em>” I heard Cleria’s voice in my ears through our link.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wait for one hour and begin the second phase of the attack. Tell them to put everyone in the building to sleep and move out of the premises only leaving Shadow Clones to take care of everything there.”</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Master, what of the Satans</em>?”</p><p><br></p><p>“They won’t move.” I reassured.</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Y</em>es.”</p><p><br></p><p>I called Charlene. “Start the plan?”</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Yes Master.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Sona Sitri -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She looked at the lady standing in front of her giving a lecture. Helena Dantalion. The smartest woman in the Underworld.</p><p><br></p><p>She was explaining about the theories of Modern Devil magic and how it could revolutionise the entire Devil magic system. She had been researching ways to improve the existing system of Devil Magic for a while and had made great progress and instead of keeping everything to herself, she decided to educate everyone.</p><p><br></p><p>But that’s what one would expect from someone like her. Helena Dantalion was probably the most renowned educationist in the Underworld. Many people called her the female version of Ajuka Beelzebub. All her lectures were full whenever she decided to conduct one.</p><p><br></p><p>Even this one, many of the Pillar houses had sent their children to attend the lecture.</p><p><br></p><p>Too many things had been happening everywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>Her sister has been very busy with work. And while it was good that she was not disturbing her, she was starting to miss her sometimes.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone was getting busy with their own work. Even Rias was more than busy with training. She had changed a lot after meeting someone(she hadn’t told her whom no matter how much she asked). But since then she started training beyond anything Sona had seen.</p><p><br></p><p>It even pushed her to work harder. She couldn’t let her rival surpass her.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias was working towards her dream of becoming the Rating Game Champion so, it was only normal that she worked harder towards her dream too.</p><p><br></p><p>And thus, she was here.</p><p><br></p><p>So when she heard that she was conducting a new lecture and on such a topic which was directly related to her dream, she booked it directly.</p><p><br></p><p>The lecture was going all good and she got to learn a few things. It was then that a blast resounded in the area. The gates of the auditorium were blasted off and a few seconds later, people rushed in.</p><p><br></p><p>She, on reflex, tried to teleport away but found herself unable to do so. Looking outside from the windows to see that a barrier had been erected all over the area.</p><p><br></p><p>An attack.</p><p><br></p><p>Terrorists?</p><p><br></p><p>She tried to see who the people attacking were and could recognize a few faces. As far as she remembered, these were the peerage members of Alfred Purson, Megalen Zepar and Corason Asmoday, all three were top ten Rating Game players.</p><p><br></p><p>Why were they attacking them?</p><p><br></p><p>Charlene Glasya-Labolas, the younger sister of Satan Asmodeus rushed forward and created a barrier around the children who were running everywhere, creating a lot of chaos.</p><p><br></p><p>“Who are you people?” She asked but got no answer in return.</p><p><br></p><p>Helena Dantalion took charge and stood in front of them, creating ripples in space with her Dantalion trait and destroying two of the intruders who were nearing other children with casual ease.</p><p><br></p><p>Charlene Glasya-Labolas was not far behind. After stabilising the barrier, she attacked and took down another one.</p><p><br></p><p>The surprising fact was that Sona knew the ones who were killed. The Rook and Knights of Alfred Purson, the fifth position of the Top Ten Rating Game players.</p><p><br></p><p>They were all Ultimate Class Devils.</p><p><br></p><p>And yet, they took them out so easily.</p><p><br></p><p>This level of power, she didn’t know any Ultimate Class devil who could do so. Were they as strong as her sister?</p><p><br></p><p>But amidst this chaos, the intruders managed to capture some of the children.</p><p><br></p><p>Alfred Purson had Seekvaira by her neck.</p><p><br></p><p>“Surrender and you will get a chance to live as long as they accept our demands. Resist and she dies.” The devil shouted.</p><p><br></p><p>Sona could see them gritting their teeth but they had to relent.</p><p><br></p><p>While Helena argued with them, Charlene took the chance to pull her behind her. “Stay with me. They might try targeting us because of our siblings. Keep calm. Your fear is their strength.  Don’t worry, everything will be alright.”</p><p><br></p><p>She controlled herself and nodded her head.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. Everything will be alright.</p><p><br></p><p>She could only hope so.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Damien -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Sona Sitri is currently with me. The mission was successful and none of the children were hurt.</em>” I listened to Charlene’s report from the other side.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see. Protect them. They are not a part of this.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Master.”</p><p><br></p><p>The plan I made to stop the Satans was an age-old one.</p><p><br></p><p>Hostages.</p><p><br></p><p>Kidnap some important children, mostly heirs and heiresses.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, there was an attempt on Rias and her peerage members too but they were repelled by the joint efforts of Rias, Akame and Gasper. The kidnappers were caught but committed suicide. When they were interrogated, they found that two people were from the King Piece users while the rest were from the Old Satan faction.</p><p><br></p><p>There were several reasons behind this. Akira didn’t want Akame to be involved in this so we decided to skip them. The attempt would still help shake them up a little. Not to mention, we didn’t want the slight risk of Rias going into Juggernaut Drive. And last but not the least, if Sirzechs were to move now, other houses whose children are hostages would call him out on it.</p><p><br></p><p>This whole situation is going to make the entire Underworld divided on how to handle the situation. On one hand, the old devils who would want nothing more than to kill them off to hide their mess and on the other, the Houses whose children are trapped who wouldn’t want to risk it.</p><p><br></p><p>And with Sona and Charlene there, two of the Satans will be involved too.</p><p><br></p><p>The Archduke Agares’ group will be siding with the Satans too as his Heiress is there.</p><p><br></p><p>All this will greatly reduce their response time. By the time they try solving this, our work will be done.</p><p><br></p><p>To avoid any unforeseen problems with the children’s security, I placed them in captivity with Charlene and Helena together. Both of them showed a bit of their strength and would get more exposure after this incident was over due to this.</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t understand something?” Cleria asked me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Why didn’t we target anyone from the Astaroth House?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Wouldn’t have helped. Ajuka would have moved regardless. While he would want to protect his family, he is not the type to risk damage to the Underworld. To be honest, he is the only one who is truly a Satan among the current ones. Sirzechs might be a good wartime leader….but he was not effective for peace times.” Just like Michael, he was a general not a King. “He and the other two are good… but they are no Satans.”</p><p><br></p><p>“... I see.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Start the second part of the plan. I will be returning. We need to begin our show there too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Master.”</p><p><br></p><p>Gretel made a Shadow Clone to follow me while her real self went in for the second part of the plan.</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x_________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I reached my bar and found my Shadow Clone washing his face in the washroom.</p><p><br></p><p>\"What happened?\" I asked, curious.</p><p><br></p><p>In reply, he just deadpanned at me and dispelled.</p><p><br></p><p>Getting the memories of the clone I let out a chuckle.</p><p><br></p><p>Well, let's get the game started, shall we?</p><p><br></p><p>I walked out to the hall and the atmosphere was weird to say the least.</p><p><br></p><p>Michael was still staring at me as if I was a ghost.</p><p><br></p><p>His guard, David Cero, I assume had all his body tense as if he was waiting to jump on me at any moment.</p><p><br></p><p>And Azazel had a wide grin on his face while showing me a camera.</p><p><br></p><p>\"That was not good, you know. Spitting on me at first sight. Some might even think you are jealous of my handsome looks.\" I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>It did help break the tense atmosphere a bit.</p><p><br></p><p>Odin let out a snort while Thor blatantly laughed. Shemhazai merely shook his head.</p><p><br></p><p>While the devils were looking awkwardly at the scene.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I… you… what?\" He stuttered.</p><p><br></p><p>Looking at his face, I couldn't keep it in any more and burst out in laughter.</p><p><br></p><p>Some of the others did too.</p><p><br></p><p>I walked up to him and for the first time in real life took a good look at him.</p><p><br></p><p>Except for the blonde girly hair and golden wings, he looked exactly like me.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, looking at him in real life was quite different. I knew a lot about him through the memories of Lucifer but the feeling of looking at him was… quite nostalgic.</p><p><br></p><p>I offered him a hand. \"Damien Lucifer. Nice to meet you, Archangel Michael.\"</p><p><br></p><p><strong>– Chysis Gremory -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The day had been nothing short of an emotional rollercoaster for her.</p><p><br></p><p>An invitation from a Lucifer. Even now, she sometimes found herself staring at the boy's face in a daze. But then again, she was probably not the only one.</p><p><br></p><p>Archangel Michael was looking at what was probably his Mirror Image with silver hair without blinking an eye. He'd been doing so since the boy entered the room.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone on his side had gathered behind him and each one of these could cause tremors through the world.</p><p><br></p><p>Merlin Asmodeus.</p><p><br></p><p>Ingvild Leviathan.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the Lucifuge girl who was poised as if a coiled snake waiting for anything to endanger her Master so that she can pounce on them.</p><p><br></p><p>She could see why Grayfia was so shaken from her last Romania visit.</p><p><br></p><p>Each of them had surpassed their predecessors by miles.</p><p><br></p><p>Actually, even Celine, someone whom she had faced several times, seemed so far away just by standing in front of her.</p><p><br></p><p>She could take a guess, especially after seeing the same in Rias.</p><p><br></p><p>He told everyone his story, of how he was born and how he escaped with the help of Razevan Lucifer.</p><p><br></p><p>\"If I may?\" The exorcist asked.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Yes?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"What exactly are your intentions now? You surely didn't call everyone here to just meet and greet.\"</p><p><br></p><p>She had heard about this human. The one who is called the Strongest Human alive, able to match Ultimate Class beings with ease. Even if she wasn't in touch with the present day affairs, she still knew the name Vasco Strada.</p><p><br></p><p>He was one of the rare few who had honour in the Church.</p><p><br></p><p>But today, despite his voice and mannerisms being perfect, she could sense a slight tone of hostility from him. Then again, it was understandable. He stood in front of the literal devil, the personification of everything he was taught growing up heretical. Lucifer was the very thing exorcists were made to oppose.</p><p><br></p><p>The other exorcist on the other hand was completely different. He wasn’t even trying to hide his feelings.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Obviously. Any doubts?\" He answered.</p><p><br></p><p>The exorcist remained stoic.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Although, you seem to dislike me for some reason. Maybe that's what's affecting your reasoning ability somewhat.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I do not hate you. What I dislike is what your face, your name represents.\" The exorcist answered, unwaveringly.</p><p><br></p><p>His subordinates were offended but a simple raised hand returned their expressions to normal.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Oh, and what exactly does my face represent? All of the world's evil? Everything that is negative in this world? Someone who eats newborns for breakfast and angel hearts for dinner?” He smiled sarcastically at them.</p><p><br></p><p>The two exorcists kept quiet although the blatant rage on the younger one's face was obvious.</p><p><br></p><p>“And is that wrong? The person whose face you carry is a killer… a murderer.” The younger one scowled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, I carry Michael’s face.” He joked, making several people laugh while the exorcist scowled. “As for taking lives? They were offered deals. Their free wills were never taken away… unlike the children in the church.” He smirked, while the exorcists frowned. “And yet they chose to accept it even at the cost of their own souls. Then again, if you look through history, you will find that Angels and The Church have taken more lives than any devil dead or alive.” He continued. “I know you will not believe me so you can ask him.” he pointed towards Michael who was sitting there with their mouths open.</p><p><br></p><p>“When a war is fought, both sides are at fault. Some more, some less. A difference in belief doesn’t allow you the right to kill someone else.”</p><p><br></p><p>“They were sinners.” The younger exorcist protested.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh… well going by that logic, those who accepted the deals of the devil were also sinners. Why all this blame then?”</p><p><br></p><p>“You tempted them!”</p><p><br></p><p>“And they made the choice. They gave in to the sin. I didn’t hold their legs and drag them. It was ‘Free Will’ which you are all so proud of. No dear, what you hate is not me. What you hate is your own weakness. Your own fault. And what do humans do when they don’t want to owe up to their faults? They push the blame onto someone else.” He remarked sarcastically.</p><p><br></p><p>She did notice that he was using a first person’s speech when addressing it. His words had changed a bit. She didn’t know if it was intentional but the effect of seeing it first hand was something else for someone like her who had seen the original Devil.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy was a mirror image of him and yet different. He had every bit of that fabled pride but instead of exuding it from his entire being, he kept it tightly wrapped around himself… somehow in better control. And he was doing it unconsciously.</p><p><br></p><p>It was as if he was the Devil… and yet more than just the Devil.</p><p><br></p><p>“You all say that I do this because I hate humans. I do not hate humans.” he began, making many people pause and look at him. “Lucifer married Lilith, the first human female. I have several humans as my subordinates whom I love and cherish as my own family. I have called a human woman mother and would gladly have burned the world if she had just said it once.” He spoke and everyone just listened.</p><p><br></p><p>The words were stunning for everyone. Even them, who had followed the original devil and yet there were things she couldn’t deny.</p><p><br></p><p>“No, what I hate is when all of you don’t take responsibility for your own actions. You all commit sins and then blame it on others, never really trying to look at your own self, always thinking of yourself as special. And what’s that phrase you use? ‘The Devil made me do it’. What bullshit! That would imply the Devil gave a damn about your miserable little lives. Don’t overestimate yourself so much. If you don’t make an effort to improve yourselves, then why should we sacrifice everything to wipe your asses?”</p><p><br></p><p>By this point the room was completely quiet as he continued speaking.</p><p><br></p><p>“‘Free will’ What nonsense? Was Lilith given free will?” He threw a fleeting look at Zeoticus and her son seemed to wither away from it. “You are all just lucky that <em>He</em> took a liking to you otherwise…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Helel!” Michael raised his voice.</p><p><br></p><p>“Damien! My name… is Damien.” He replied back.</p><p><br></p><p>The Archangel realised what he had said and backed away, wide eyed as if struck by something.</p><p><br></p><p>Azazel stepped in at this moment. “Alright, we are getting completely off-topic here. This is supposed to be a meeting to get to know each other and make everyone's positions clear, so that you don’t make mistakes with any identities. Damien is not with the old Satan faction. He has his own people and is recognised by the Youkai, the Fallen Angels and the Norse.” He turned towards them. “No idea about them. So, you as the leader of the Angels, needed to know this to decide what path Heaven will be taking.” He then turned towards Damien. “And you Damien, stop being provoked. You called him here for peace.”</p><p><br></p><p>He took a deep breath and spoke. “I apologise. I am allergic to the scent of hypocrisy. It makes me feel uncomfortable. For this same reason, I invited only Michael and not anyone else.” He shrugged casually.</p><p><br></p><p>Archangel Michael seemed to have collected himself and let out a sigh. He turned towards the exorcists. “Both of you, wait for me outside.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But my Lord…”</p><p><br></p><p>“It is fine.” Michael reassured.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Sir.” the Older of the two bowed.</p><p><br></p><p>With the annoyance gone, the atmosphere calmed a bit.</p><p><br></p><p>“What exactly are your intentions, Damien? You have amassed yourself quite a group. I dare say, very few people would want to fight with you at all. So… what is it that you want to do?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Live. We want to live our own lives without getting dragged into the mess of the Three Factions… unfortunately that isn’t so easy to do. So the amassed forces. But let’s not get to the fighting art shall we? That’s not what I called you here for. What I want is… a deal.”</p><p><br></p><p>Michael raised an eyebrow.</p><p><br></p><p>“We do not mess with your people and in return, you leave us alone. Among all the three factions, Heaven and the Church are the most likely to attack us. And thus I have called you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So what do you propose?”</p><p><br></p><p>“We divide areas. Your people don’t enter my area and my people won’t enter yours. We do not attack each other unless provoked or attacked first. And no, me existing doesn’t count as provocation.”</p><p><br></p><p>Merlin passed over a file and let him have a look with the clauses we had prepared.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will discuss it with my fellow brothers and sisters and give you a reply.” Michael replied. “Now, can we move on to other topics? I came here on someone’s invitation. Will I be meeting him?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! You didn’t invite him, Damien?” Azazel asked, surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>“And how would I do that? Knocking on Heaven's gates and dropping in an invitation?” He deadpanned, making some chuckle.</p><p><br></p><p>He then turned towards Michael. “No. Although, he left a message. As long as Heaven follows the path shown by Father, he will protect it. He would do the same for all three factions.” This earned him some raised eyebrows. “But… should anyone try to start another Great War… he will end them personally.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Who was this again?” Azazel asked, scoffing lightly and taking a sip of his wine.</p><p><br></p><p>“The Mysterious Super Angel guy.”</p><p><br></p><p>The Fallen leader choked.</p><p><br></p><p>“What?!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Pretty cool guy if you ask me. We have quite similar thoughts and he seemed to have no problem with us either. Offered to send the letter to Michael as a way to show his intentions. Also left another message and I quote, ‘As a gift for finally getting your head straight and doing what you do best. As she used to say, you were always a general and he… was the King.’” He passed a piece of paper to Michael who accepted it with almost shaking hands.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Damien -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The look on Michael’s face was priceless.</p><p><br></p><p>I was not lying. I really did give him a gift for getting his head straight.</p><p><br></p><p>Him getting his A game resulted in the Church being reigned in a lot, preventing a lot of problems.</p><p><br></p><p>So, I decided to solve a few of his problems.</p><p><br></p><p>I gave him the information about the Angels who were using the Heaven System’s loopholes to avoid falling and a method to prevent that.</p><p><br></p><p>Should help him get things done.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, what the hell. Since we are already on this topic, I will bite the bullet and ask. Is Heaven preparing for a war?” Azazel asked Michael.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. We do not desire war.” Michael replied with a tone of finality. </p><p><br></p><p>Yup.</p><p><br></p><p>The General was back again.</p><p><br></p><p>Azazel knew better than to question that tone.</p><p><br></p><p>But someone else didn’t.</p><p><br></p><p>“But Heaven’s actions might say otherwise.” Serafall pointed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh? And how so?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Heaven is rapidly increasing its power. It does make others feel a bit tingly.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But didn’t the Devils do the same? Use the Evil Pieces to rapidly increase their numbers? Recruit exceptional talents and increase their strength rapidly? So, why is it that when Heaven does the same, it’s seen as an act of war?” He questioned, not giving her an inch.</p><p><br></p><p>I had to forcibly keep myself from smiling at his reply.</p><p><br></p><p>Poor Serafall, who had never seen this version of Michael, was at a loss of words for a few moments.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs, realising that his fellow Satan had been had, intervened. “Please don’t misunderstand. We were taken aback by the suddenness of this decision.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes… we decided that we have had enough of a mourning period. It was time to work.”</p><p><br></p><p>That shut him up for good.</p><p><br></p><p>I knew this look. This Michael was like an iron cage. One could keep banging their heads on it and it wouldn’t shake.</p><p><br></p><p>“Since we cannot increase our numbers like the Devils using the Evil Pieces and reproducing like our Fallen brethren is difficult for us, we decided to increase the quality of our forces instead. You weren’t expecting us to remain as we were while the other two sides kept increasing their power, correct?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously not. How you run your faction is all on you. But we, as sides who have stood with and against each other for centuries, were curious about the sudden change. That is all.”</p><p><br></p><p>Michael nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>It was at this moment that a communication magic circle appeared on Serafall’s Magic hand lit up.</p><p><br></p><p>She bowed slightly, apologising and received a call.</p><p><br></p><p>On it appeared a man.</p><p><br></p><p>Someone I knew.</p><p><br></p><p>Behemoth.</p><p><br></p><p>“My Lady. There has been a rebellion in the Underworld. Six of the Top Ten Rating Game Players have rebelled. They have taken several of the prominent children hostages… including Young Miss, Sona.”</p><p><br></p><p>Serafall froze over as ice started to spread.</p><p><br></p><p>Ingvild snapped a finger and the ice melted and the water all vapourised under her command but Serafall wasn’t waiting for any of it.</p><p><br></p><p>She had already teleported away.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs who was taken aback by the sudden message also got up and bowed to us. “I apologise for suddenly leaving the meeting. I hope we can continue this some other day.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s fine. Go do what you are supposed to do.”</p><p><br></p><p>Azazel and Shemhazai got up too.</p><p><br></p><p>“It looked serious. We should check it too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay.”</p><p><br></p><p>They left soon after.</p><p><br></p><p>“You will not be going?” Odin asked me.</p><p><br></p><p>“If I find something interesting.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Bah. You younglings. Do whatever you want. It seems like you people will be busy either way so I will take my leave. Come Thor.”</p><p><br></p><p>The old God stood up and the Thunder God followed but not before giving me a light bump on the shoulders.</p><p><br></p><p>The Youkai were guided aside by Musashi to discuss some different matters.</p><p><br></p><p>The only ones left in the place were I, my subordinates and… Michael.</p><p><br></p><p>He hadn’t stopped staring at me since he arrived here.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, when everything quieted down, he broke the silence. “How?”</p><p><br></p><p>The look on his face was plain. It was as if there was no other chance. The look of one hundred percent confidence.</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t know.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What will you do now?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Find out… why.”</p><p><br></p><p>He stopped for a moment and looked as if trying to force himself to say something.</p><p><br></p><p>“How did he die?” He finally whispered out.</p><p><br></p><p>The look in his eyes… was painful to watch.</p><p><br></p><p>It hurt.</p><p><br></p><p>Despite knowing that I had no relation to him, it still… hurt badly.</p><p><br></p><p>I still couldn’t help but ask him. “You don’t think I killed him?”</p><p><br></p><p>The look on his face hardened. “I am not a fool.”</p><p><br></p><p>Those five words said a lot. I understood.</p><p><br></p><p>Michael perhaps was the only one alive who knew Lucifer more than anyone else… maybe even more than Lilith.</p><p><br></p><p>Lucifer loved his father.</p><p><br></p><p>No, it was beyond that.</p><p><br></p><p>It was his whole obsession.</p><p><br></p><p>To prove a point to his Father, that humans were not worthy of his love. That’s what made him rebel.</p><p><br></p><p>And this kind of obsession stayed.</p><p><br></p><p>To go against all that and kill his Father… was impossible.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole fact was an antithesis to what he stood for, to the being which was Lucifer.</p><p><br></p><p>And if someone understood this… it would be Michael.</p><p><br></p><p>So, his answer was enough.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you want to see?”</p><p><br></p><p>He froze but then nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>I raised a finger and touched his forehead.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Mindscape -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I showed him the whole scene of the fight.</p><p><br></p><p>The Archangel Michael, the strongest Angel, the right hand of God, shed tears as he watched the wounds being inflicted on his Father’s body.</p><p><br></p><p>We reached the scene where God threw himself on Lucifer’s sword and he fell to his knees.</p><p><br></p><p>Both of us quietly listened to his last words.</p><p><br></p><p>“I know that you are angry at me, blame me for many things so… with this… let go of your rage… your anger and return home… son.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man whom these words were addressed to was still frozen in shock.</p><p><br></p><p>“I know that I have not handled some things as well as I should have. I didn’t stop you when you left home. I didn’t stop you when you discarded your light. I didn’t do some things which a father should have… for those I apologise.”</p><p><br></p><p>The words made me understand why Lucifer turned out the way he did after leaving Heaven. About how he turned into <em>that</em>…</p><p><br></p><p>He had discarded his light.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, it might not seem like much in words but that was only till one realises that Angels were beings of light. It was a part of their very souls.</p><p><br></p><p>… yes. This madman… ripped out a part of his soul and discarded it.</p><p><br></p><p>It was literally Voldemort syndrome.</p><p><br></p><p>Kinda made sense when I think about his drastically different behaviour, the power of his mother and the Fallen Angels…</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>The Fallen.</p><p><br></p><p>What God did when creating Angels was use the light as a seal using his blessing, grace, over their darkness from his wife.</p><p><br></p><p>The Angels who give into the sins, empower their mother’s side and lose the blessing , letting the darkness manifest in the of black wings.</p><p><br></p><p>Lucifer on the other hand, who had thrown aside his light was a complete creature of darkness. The only reason his power remained as much as it was, was because there was no light suppressing the darkness and thus one side worked at full power.</p><p><br></p><p>“This war… I was forced to fight… to prevent a dreadful future from happening. There wasn’t a moment in this war, which I didn’t regret shedding the blood of my children but in every piece of the futures I saw, without this war, our world would have been doomed.”</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Knowing his abilities as a Seer, that statement was not ominous at all.</p><p><br></p><p>“So I leave all this to you.” He brought out an orb of light from his own chest. “As a last wish from your Father… promise me that you will not let another Great War happen… and take care of your little siblings. Know this… no matter where I am, or what happens to you, I will always love you all… my children.”</p><p><br></p><p>With that said, he took his last breath.</p><p><br></p><p>Michael was on his knees crying his heart out.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t think he had done so since he had to act strong for the sake of the other Angels.</p><p><br></p><p>We kept watching.</p><p><br></p><p>Lucifer stood up, as if a zombie.</p><p><br></p><p>First he made a coffin for Beelzebub and Asmodeus.</p><p><br>Even Leviathan was shocked. “Lucifer.”</p><p><br></p><p>“They are my comrades. They supported me when I had nothing, fought with me and gave their lives just because of their trust in me. If I leave them laying here… I would be a disgrace of a king.”</p><p><br></p><p>With that done, he moved to his Father’s body and picked it up, making a coffin for it and placed him there softly.</p><p><br></p><p>Michael, as if realising something, asked. “Where is his body?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Keep watching.”</p><p><br></p><p>We did.</p><p><br></p><p>As Lucifer and Leviathan kneeled there, mourning, another person came to the scene.</p><p><br></p><p>The face which made me want to rip it into pieces.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, what’s this? Asmodeus and even Beelzebub are gone? And so is God, hahahahaha. So the old man finally kicked the bucket. Well good riddance.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Rizevim…” Lucifer’s voice sounded. He didn’t turn back but I knew the anger in his tone. Michael did as well.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes father. What are the orders? Do we start the invasion of Heaven? Or do we go there after we crush the Fallen, those cowards… so many options, so many choices.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We are not going anywhere. The war is over. Go and call back all our forces.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What! What do you mean the war is over? We are just getting to the good part.” he shouted.</p><p><br></p><p>“Rizevim, follow my orders. We have all lost too much. Anything more and there might not be anything left.” Leviathan chided.</p><p><br></p><p>She apparently understood Lucifer’s mind as well being comrades for so long.</p><p><br></p><p>“You can’t be serious… Just because some people die, you are stopping the war? We are Devils… since when did we care about a few deaths”</p><p><br></p><p>“Rizevim!...That’s an order. Now leave.” Leviathan commanded sternly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you of the same opinion Father?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.” Lucifer replied without even turning back.</p><p><br></p><p>Rizevim quietly stood there without any words.</p><p><br></p><p>“Such a waste. To think that the mighty Devil… would fall to this point one day.”</p><p><br></p><p>The next second, he attacked. Leviathan was thrown aside from the force of the sudden attack. The surprise and her previous wound made sure that she lost her life instantly.</p><p><br></p><p>Lucifer stood up, rage filling his eyes and attacked.</p><p><br></p><p>But the man was already weaker than his son, not to mention, was exhausted from the war. He stood no chance.</p><p><br></p><p>He was thrown on his Father’s coffin.</p><p><br></p><p>“But don’t worry Father. I will let the world remember you as the Devil. Not a pathetic guy who wanted… peace. Hmm, maybe hanging the body of God on the front lines would be good to send the Angels into a crazy fit. Yes. That’s a good idea. Since we are reaching the climax, why not go all out on it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You dare!” Lucifer roared but at this point even he knew that he couldn’t resist.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe this was called karma.</p><p><br></p><p>“You will die. If not by my hands today, then by the hands of someone carrying my blood but… you will die. I curse you.” He spewed as if poison. One of his hands, slowly pushing the orb of light from God into the Spear letting it absorb it.</p><p><br></p><p>The spear was teleported away by him.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. Another thing which had always bugged me.</p><p><br></p><p>How did God make a Spear containing his dying will?</p><p><br></p><p>This seems to have been the answer.</p><p><br></p><p>It also explained why the Spear seemed to call out to me and why I could turn into an Angel when I touched it.</p><p><br></p><p>“As for touching my Father’s and my comrades’ bodies…” He turned back towards the coffin behind him and hugged it, only turning his head behind, “You’re not worthy.”</p><p><br></p><p>And then there was light.</p><p><br></p><p>A bright light which threatened to burn everything down.</p><p><br></p><p>It enveloped us but we remained unharmed as it was just a memory.</p><p><br></p><p>When the light subsided, there was nothing left.</p><p><br></p><p>The memory ended.</p><p><br></p><p>Both Michael and I were back at the bar.</p><p><br></p><p>The last memory was too much for him to take.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sean.” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Michael looked at me as Sean summoned the Longinus.</p><p><br></p><p>“And here’s the proof of my words.” I held the spear.</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>The Lord is my God.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>And twelve silver Angelic wings sprung out.</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><strong>Fucking finally.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>This damn chapter took me several rewrites to finish.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>It’s like I could have made the chapter double the length if I didn’t have to rewrite it so many times.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Anyways, we got to see what exactly happened with God and Lucifer.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The mess in the Underworld and many other things.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am too tired to write the Author’s note and I don’t think anyone would want me to delay the chapter because of it either.

True but… I don't see how any of that is my problem?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha yes, how is that our problem?” He laughed. “So what are you going to name the bar?”</p><p><br></p><p>“773H.”</p><p><br></p><p>It took him a moment to realise the meaning of the name and then he laughed even more. “So apt.”</p><p><br></p><p>As we were talking, someone entered the room. Gretel bowed before reporting.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Master, we’ve received news from our spies. Fallen Angel Sataneel has rebelled. He is working with the Wizards of Oz and the Utsusemi Organisation and has been targeting the Four Fiends Sacred Gears.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Got it.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Any news on Augusta?\" I asked. </p><p><br></p><p>\"She was seen in Japan. Our spies have been able to locate her current location and plans.\"</p><p><br></p><p>The spies were a great idea from Suzaku of all people. The Utsusemi Agency is made up of the exiles of the Five Principal Clans. Like how many do they even exile for them to make an entire organisation out of it?</p><p><br></p><p>Suzaku's idea was to send a few of her more troublesome members bound by a contract as spies to infiltrate the Utsusemi Agency. She exiled them and a few of them were indeed picked up by the Utsusemi Agency soon.</p><p><br></p><p>This way, some problematic individuals were removed from the Himejima Clan and we got some insiders in the Utsusemi Agency.</p><p><br></p><p>“What plans?”</p><p><br></p><p>“They are…” She paused for a bit and I looked at her. She took a light breath and continued. “They are being supported by the Shinto Pantheon.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>I looked a bit thoughtful.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, it was not a matter of if but rather of when and how. We had already predicted this was going to happen. They will probably stay behind and watch them tear each other apart. So, who are they attacking, the other Five Principal Clans or the Youkai?” Merlin asked, unbothered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Both. They have also pushed for the Gokadoin house to attack the Five Principal Clans while the Utsusemi Agency will poke the Youkai. Both their relations to the other side will be used to instigate a war between both sides.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s quite good if I say so myself. Especially considering Yasaka’s current attitude, she wouldn’t back down either. But still, they will need to do something major to cause a war between the two sides.”</p><p><br></p><p>Gretel paused at this sentence.</p><p><br></p><p>I narrowed my eyes at her reaction. “Who are they targeting?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yasaka’s daughter Kunou, Nurarihyon’s Grandson and… Shirone-chan.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“I see.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s… going after the leader’s families and the younger sister of a sage who happens to be a young sage herself. The Youkai are not going to stop until there is nothing left. At that point maybe, the Shinto will come down acting like the high and mighty keepers of peace when both sides are battered up badly.” Merlin assessed. “So what will you do?”</p><p><br></p><p>I kept quiet.</p><p><br></p><p>“Master?” Gretel said, breaking me out of my thoughts.</p><p><br></p><p>“How are the students of Hagoromo doing?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“They are progressing quite well in the Jujutsu Techniques. Ayakashi and Youkai are innately good at using Jujutsu due to being born from Negative feelings of humans. In fact, most of them can manifest their Fear techniques as their Innate Curse Technique. Currently, five of her top subordinates have achieved the creation of a Domain. This includes Rikuo Nura and Tsurara Oikawa. Half a dozen others are progressing well. Among her subordinates, over eight hundred have grasped basic Jujutsu techniques.”</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. Nurarihyon actually sent his own grandson to Hagoromo Gitsune of all people to learn as a show of trust for the Kyubi. I got to respect the balls on that old man. Doing all this to end the enmity of centuries just for the progress of his kind. He was a good leader. True leader.</p><p><br></p><p>Hagoromo Gitsune was able to reverse engineer Jujutsu Techniques from my words. She even went ahead and devised her own Domain Expansion. It did take a considerable amount of knowledge about barriers however she had the knowledge of the barrier from Nue. This made her work considerably easier. A nerfed Archmage did the rest.</p><p><br></p><p>Then she went on to teach these techniques to all her subordinates loyal to her. Everyone was progressing differently but they did get stronger.</p><p><br></p><p>As for Hagoromo Gitsune herself, the woman has a Domain without barriers where she can shower her enemies with any of the techniques from her nine tails.</p><p><br></p><p>“First inform Yasaka and Nurarihyon.  As our allies, this is our duty towards them. Second, place guards with Shirone. If they do attack her…” I took a deep breath. “Kill their entire organisation. Tell Hagoromo Gitsune to do so. Get evidence about the involvement of the Shinto and publicise it.”</p><p><br></p><p>We have been gritting our teeth and bearing things for over a decade now and finally we have enough strength. I won't allow my people to be walked over anymore.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Master. What about the Wizards of Oz and Fallen Angel Sataneel?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Was he declared rogue officially?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Yes.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"In that case, inform Azazel. I will go there myself with Celine.” I turned towards Merlin. “Will you be joining us?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm why not? I want to see what that organisation has amounted to in the last few centuries.” Merlin agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Anything else?\" I asked her.</p><p><br></p><p>\"You were planning to take Miss Vienna for a spar against Rias Gremory.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Ah… yes. It was that time already. I need to prepare for it.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Send a message to Sirzechs. Actually, send him a card for the opening of the bar.\" I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>My otaku friend has been training real hard this last year since. Although not at Vienna's level, she has gotten quite strong.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Who do you think will win? I haven't seen your little friend but there are rumours about the new Red Dragon Empress. You have been teaching her yourself. I wonder how strong she is.\" Merlin questioned.</p><p><br></p><p>\"She is progressing well. There is great potential but she will likely lose this fight. Vi has had longer specified training than her. Although she is using Shadow Clones, it will still take her a year more before she can match Vi. But…\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"But?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"There is still a minute chance that she could make it a tie.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hoh! That would be quite a sight.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"It would be, yeah. You’re going to meet your own student, I’m guessing?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Oh yes. He's one of the most interesting students I have had in a while. In your language, he would be a classic Shounen Protagonist if things had been a little different. He reminds me a lot of myself hahahaha.\" He laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Yes, he does give off that vibe. Any interference from his family?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I don't think those people deserve to call themselves his family.\" He replied, his tone a little angry.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. I can see how Sairaorg Bael would remind him of his own past.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Tell me something about him. How is he doing? I only met him once and that too for not long.\" I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Sai has a will and resolve I have rarely seen in people. You already know his condition.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hmm, I bound him so that my Archmage could solve that problem.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Yeah, about that. He rejected using magic.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Say what?\" I asked, surprised. He was quite young, not the Sairaorg Bael of a few years later but a boy who was kicked out of his house, had his position taken away and even his mother fell into sickness. He was still able to reject magic?</p><p><br></p><p>\"According to him, if he chose the easy way out, several others like him will never get hope that they can become something in life even without any magic. The boy wants to be a Satan, a King to change things, to make things better. It's… a beautiful dream. Much nobler than my petty revenge.\" He sighed.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn't interrupt his thoughts.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hmm. So, what are you teaching him?\" I asked, shifting the heavy topic.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Well, Haki would be obvious. I thought of teaching him about chakra but I remembered something better.\" He smirked. \"I taught him Nen. The boy has insane potential for it. Especially with the oath he made.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Nen Oath?\" I raised an eyebrow.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Yes. His oath was to never use magic and with your gift, you can imagine the result he got. He is a pure Enhancer. Couple that with Haki, a rare Conqueror's Haki user, Regulus Nemea and we have a beast of Close Quarter Combat on our hands.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Is this guy turning him into a miniature Saitama?</p><p><br></p><p>\"Did you tell him about the Sleeping Illness?\" I asked, getting back to the topic at hand.</p><p><br></p><p>Merlin's face turned serious as he nodded. \"He took it quite well and said that he will not raise a single finger to assist them if their crimes are proven and they were indeed responsible for his mother's condition. I accepted and offered protection and a cure for his mother when everything was over.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I see. Then do it. If he wants to become a Satan, make him. The Underworld would do well with a few good people. Although it seems that things are turning for the better, there is bound to be chaos soon enough. Changes of this level are never peaceful. And the current leaders would actually welcome it if someone else took their seats after all this was done.\"</p><p><br></p><p><strong>– Sirzechs –</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He returned back home as soon as he heard about the message from the youngest Lucifer.</p><p><br></p><p>At home, the entire family had gathered.</p><p><br></p><p>His Grandmother was sitting in the lead facing a figure who appeared to be human. Mathers and Souji were behind them as if to protect all of them and finally, Rias sat beside their grandmother and her queen stood behind her.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl in front of them had pinkish hair and wore a kimono and carried two katanas on her side while she was sitting and having snacks.</p><p><br></p><p>“These cookies are very nice Maam.” She praised as she took another bite. “And this tea is great as well. As good as the tea made by Akeno-chan.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you. I am glad you like it.” Grandmother replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm umm.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Could you introduce yourself?” Grandmother asked. “We only know you as the messenger of Damien Lucifer Asmodeus.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Me? My formal name? Shinmen Musashi-no-Kami Fujiwara no Harunobu. Still, it’s easier if you just call me Musashi.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now this raised many eyebrows.</p><p><br></p><p>“Musashi… as in Musashi Miyamoto? The famed swordsman of Japan?” Souji asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“A reincarnation actually but yes. By the way, I have heard of you too. Okita Souji, the former captain of Shinsengumi. There are very few swordsmen who have left their name on our country’s history and everyone is worth their title. I would love to duel you someday.” She smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>Souji bowed in return. “I would be honoured.”</p><p><br></p><p>By then they had noticed his presence and turned towards him.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl stood up and bowed to him. “My name is Musashi Miyamoto, messenger of my Master, Damien Lucifer Asmodeus. I am here to deliver a letter of invitation from my Master.” She brought out a letter from his sleeve and passed it on to him.</p><p><br></p><p>He raised an eyebrow at the letter and opened it. His expressions became strange as he read the letter. Just to verify if he had read it correctly, he reread it again.</p><p><br></p><p>“This…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, Master thought it was time for the spar between Miss Vienna and her rival and wanted to decide on a meeting place so he invited you over to the event to meet and talk the matter over. You can obviously bring anyone you want with you. It’s just a celebration.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But why would he do…” He asked, perplexed.</p><p><br></p><p>She merely shrugged. “Master said it’s something every Lucifer worth their name should do. I have no idea what it means.”</p><p><br></p><p>He just looked oddly at the reply.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Can anyone join?\" His Grandmother asked.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Oh yes. Everyone is welcome. Well it's good for the business anyway.\" She smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>He shook off his thoughts and spoke. \"In that case, I will be honoured to join the celebration. May I ask if there will be other people there?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Mostly us and our allies.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Hmm. It would actually give him a chance to scout their faction a little. He knew that Nurarihyon and Yasaka were definitely invited. But do they have any other allies?</p><p><br></p><p>Azazel had been poking his nose there recently. He had found out about Rias gaining the Booster Gear and that he was visiting Romania during the 'Great Collapse' as they are calling it in hushed voices now and proceeded to ask questions. That man's curiosity was dangerous.</p><p><br></p><p>He had somehow managed to keep him away but he was sure that even he, like several others, had connected the dots and thus was visiting Japan often.</p><p><br></p><p>As he was thinking of this, Rias excitedly asked the girl. \"Do you know Damien's sister? How strong is she? Last time I had seen her, she had already unlocked her Balance Breaker. Is she stronger now?\"  </p><p><br></p><p>\"Hmm, are you talking about your chances in the spar?</p><p><br></p><p>Rias nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure you want to know?” She asked, quite seriously.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.” Rias replied resolutely.</p><p><br></p><p>\"You have gotten quite strong from what I can sense. At least since the last time I saw you. But, she has been getting stronger too. If you don't have any Trump cards, I would say that you have around 2% chances of winning.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"T-t-two percent?\"</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone in the room was stunned.</p><p><br></p><p>They had seen the growth of Rias in the last few years. Especially since she got her Longinus. She has dedicated most of her time to training. Currently, if she were to use her Longinus, she would be able to put up a fight against even their parents.</p><p><br></p><p>So to say that she only had a two percent chance of winning.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Eh, it's not that surprising, you know. Vi has been training under Gre-chan and Master since she was seven. Her normal sparring partners are all extremely talented Ultimate Class beings. And even if we put aside these for a moment, Vi, like Master, can use the 'Denial of the Divine'. Although she will not use it in your spar, it being a spar between your Sacred Gears, she could negate all your advantage in a moment. It's a conservative estimate. To be honest, only Master himself thinks you have a slight chance of winning this year. But that's mostly due to the lack of time. Aside from that you are doing pretty good, ya know. You are among the top ten people of your age. At this rate, next year, you could put up a good fight.\"</p><p><br></p><p>They can use what!</p><p><br></p><p>Lucifer Clan Trait?</p><p><br></p><p>Both of them?</p><p><br></p><p>“So… he said I have a chance of winning?” Rias asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Master? Yes. He said that you do have a chance of winning because of the synergy between your ability and the Boosted Gear. Other than that I don’t know anything about the matter.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay.” Rias nodded. “Thank you for telling me about this. Please excuse me.I have something to do.” And then she left.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah… I said too much didn’t I?” The girl spoke, a bit abashed.</p><p><br></p><p>“You didn’t, dear. As your Master said about his sister, I will say the same. Rias was progressing very fast. This can make people overconfident in their abilities which is not good. If anything then your words did her a favour instead. Thank you.” Grandmother said. “Please tell your Master that we are extremely thankful for his gift and look forward to meeting him.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will.”</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, you said that Rias was among the top ten of her age. I assume the first would be your Master and the younger Lucifuge child? Who are the others?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Asking me information about my group? I am sorry but I cannot say that, ya know. As for our Master and Gre-chan, they are not included in the list. That would be totally unfair. I was mostly talking about her and those younger than her.”</p><p><br></p><p>With each of her words, shock increased in his heart.</p><p><br></p><p>They had already guessed that their side would have extremely strong people seeing what his ‘Kiss’ had done to Rias but still, hearing that from someone was completely different. No wonder, he gave up the Longinus that easily.</p><p><br></p><p>They never needed it anyways.</p><p><br></p><p>“I see.” His grandmother said quite pensively.</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright, Goodbye then.”</p><p><br></p><p>He too nodded at them. “Escort her outside, Souji.”</p><p><br></p><p>As both of them left, he sat down.</p><p><br></p><p>“What was that letter about?” His father asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“An invitation.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Invitation?”</p><p><br></p><p>“An invitation to the opening of a bar.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A bar?”</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah, he was not the odd one to be surprised.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Azazel -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“What’s the letter about, Azazel?” Shemhazai asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s an invitation.” He smiled and passed on the letter to Shemhazai.</p><p><br></p><p>“A bar?”</p><p><br></p><p>“A bar opened by the Devil.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Huh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Damien is opening a bar. That’s an invitation for its opening.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Opening a bar? Why would he open a bar?” Shemhazai said, opening the letter and reading it.</p><p><br></p><p>“Because that’s cool. When has he not done what he wanted to? Compared to what he did before, opening a bar on a whim may be the cutest thing he has ever done.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay, stop comparing them, Azazel. And I know he’s supposedly the reincarnation of our brother, that said, he is a reincarnation, not the man himself. He is trying to live a new life. Respect that already.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I respect the new him alot. In fact, he is currently my second favourite member of the three factions after Gabriel but she’s up there for completely different reasons.” He said as Shemhazai rolled his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Who else will be coming?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Probably just his allies. He also sent an invitation to the old geezer Odin. So maybe the Youkai will be coming too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What are you going to do about Satanael, Azazel?” Penemue asked, causing a frown to appear on his face at the reminder. “I told you that he was acting suspiciously and now he has gone rogue. Let me go after him.”</p><p><br></p><p>He let out a sigh. To be honest, he did try to stop him but their differences were too much. Satanael’s experiments were dangerous and he wasn't willing to take any middle road. And now that he had gone rogue, Penemue was not going to stop at anything to go after him.</p><p><br></p><p>“You… can go but take Baraqiel with you and investigate. Bring him in.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright.”</p><p><br></p><p>He let out a sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, he really needed those drinks to forget this nonsense.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe opening a bar wasn’t a bad idea after all. At least he wouldn’t have to deal with all this work.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Yasaka -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She looked at the two letters and gripped one in her hand as she felt disgusted with what was written.</p><p><br></p><p>The Shinto were supporting terrorists to cull the strength of the Youkai. She didn’t even doubt it because they had done such things before. This wouldn’t be the first time.</p><p><br></p><p>“Okaa-sama? Are you okay? You look angry.” She was broken out of her thoughts by the words of her daughter.</p><p><br></p><p>She hugged Kunou close to her chest. They were going to use her as a trigger for the war. She couldn’t help but feel rage at this. What was her fault?</p><p><br></p><p>Wasn’t she doing the work assigned by Amaterasu? Then why? And if they had problems, why couldn’t they just come out and say it. Was their pride so much that they’d rather have the Youkai die than support any of them?</p><p><br></p><p>At this point it was clear that the Youkai had only two options. Either they bow their heads and accept whatever was happening or they stand their ground and increase their strength to a level where the Shinto would hesitate to plot against them. Achieving the latter was hard. Extremely so.</p><p><br></p><p>Even with the two new sages, they were nowhere near the level of the Shinto. Kuroka could fight well. In a few years maybe, she would be able to deter the Shinto but as a pantheon which has stood for thousands of years, they had some of their own cards.</p><p><br></p><p>Shirone, while having immense potential, was still young. She would still take a few years to grow into her potential.</p><p><br></p><p>But the most important thing was that both Kuroka and Shirone were a part of his group. At this point, she could only think of one other way to survive this predicament. And that was to rely on their new allies. Will that make them reliant or even subordinates to him? Maybe. But they were currently subordinates to the Shinto and look where it got them.</p><p><br></p><p>He on the other hand didn’t fear the strength of his subordinates. Each one of them, at least the ones she had met were stronger than her, stronger than a majority of the Shinto Gods. And yet, most of the world didn’t even know they existed.</p><p><br></p><p>And now, she had to make a decision. As a leader and as a mother. What she planned to do going forward because if she didn’t do anything, her people would suffer.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Satanael -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure this will be fine?” Augusta asked him for the umpteenth time. It was getting annoying but it was understandable too.</p><p><br></p><p>After all, they were dealing with something which might erase them with the blink of an eye. The being sitting in front of them in the form of a prepubescent girl might look like a harmless and innocent child but was someone even his father feared for a reason.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is a necessity.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And, what of the earlier objective?”</p><p><br></p><p>“To invoke disturbing elements, power is necessary. If it’s a human, it’s fine so long as they’ve been bestowed with a sacred gear, but where fantastical beings are concerned it’s a different story. When it comes to drawing out fantastical beings, ‘power’ as an explicit offering is necessary.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then, would that be your aim?”</p><p><br></p><p>In regards to the witch’s question, Satanael directed his gaze towards the figure in front of him.</p><p><br></p><p>“The longest living creatures in this world, dragons. Among them, said to be a Dragon God, is one endowed with the power of infinity…”</p><p><br></p><p>The witches understood.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ouroboros huh. The power of the ‘Snake’ of Ouroboros…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Imagine the power of a normal Supernatural Being drawn out and enhanced by the infinity. A simple Twice Critical enhanced by the infinity could form a Longinus theoretically. So why can’t we use this power? After all, power is what we are lacking right now.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you worried about the power behind the Youkai? They aren’t much, you know. Even their bosses, the Shinto have given up on them.” The Witch’s apprentice spoke.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s exactly why we should be wary of them. Normally the Shinto wouldn’t have relied on others to do their dirty job. But they did this time. This shows us that even they do not know who is behind the Youkai and are wary of them. They are merely using us to test the waters. If the waters are too deep, we will be by ourselves, to swim or die. If we succeed, they win. If we lose, they can just claim they had no hand in it. They are not our backup. Merely a side which is doing business with us. What we need is a backup for ourselves in case things go wrong and what better backup than the Ouroboros Dragon?” he smiled before turning towards Augusta. “Have the experiments been readied?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then we start as soon as we can.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Hagoromo Gitsune -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The Shinto was acting against the growing power of the Youkai… as if that was surprising. Didn’t she tell everyone the same back then and they thought she was going insane? Which got her killed and drove her son insane and pushed him to become what he had become.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at the children in front of her. Learning, playing and growing together. The smile on their faces as they got along with each other.</p><p><br></p><p>To ruin all this because of their insecurities…</p><p><br></p><p>“What is his order?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Master has ordered security to be placed on all the major targets, especially Shirone-chan. We are to only save the lives of Rikuo-kun and Kunou-chan but if any of them go after Shirone-chan, we are ordered to erase their organisation. You can take anyone from our side to help you out with this. The other side has a possible Longinus user, the wielder of the Incinerate Anthem and Master wants to take care of her himself so please relay the message if you encounter them. Other than that, you can act as you want.” The maid spoke evenly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Does that child Kuroka know about this?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. She will be working with you on this. Here’s all the information about their side. We could be collaborating with Yasaka and Nurarihyon-sama if they agree.”</p><p><br></p><p>She perused the information and then thought of a while. “I want Cleria Belial, Akira and… Meredith Ordinton.”</p><p><br></p><p>As she was going through the papers, she saw another name. The Gokadoin House. Her descendants…</p><p><br></p><p>“I want to request something.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Leave the Gokadoin house to me. They will not be doing any damage. I will even bring them in.”</p><p><br></p><p>“... I see. I will relay the message to Master.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s fine. You are a part of our organisation now. This is the least we can do for you.”</p><p><br></p><p>She would need to teach some wayward children a lesson, it seems.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Damien -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>One week had passed since the day I sent invitations to everyone and it was finally the day of celebration.</p><p><br></p><p>Most of my group had gathered for today’s event.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the bar in front of me and couldn’t help but have a smile on my face. The piano at the centre of the room was especially the highlight of the place. Ingvild liked singing and offered to be the singer of the place. She was happy so we don’t mind either. She had worked hard and needed her break too.</p><p><br></p><p>As for the staff of the Restaurant, each and every person selected for the Staff was an Ultimate Class at the very least.</p><p><br></p><p>More than half of my main group was here while the other half stayed hidden to work from behind the scenes to take care of things.</p><p><br></p><p>We had to adjust the plans for Operation Regicide for a bit because it seems that Zekram is trying to contact the Old Satan faction idiots and use them against Sirzechs.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy really overestimates himself.</p><p><br></p><p>With the information I had found about him, I wanted to make his end more painful. That bastard had infected Lilith with the Sleeping sickness to remove her as an obstacle.</p><p><br></p><p>Lilith.</p><p><br></p><p><em>My Lilith.</em></p><p><br></p><p>Just thinking about it made me enraged. The memories of Lucifer did bring some attachments with itself.</p><p><br></p><p>While I didn’t obsess over them, they did stir up my emotions. Especially ones belonging to his Father, Mother, siblings and… Lilith.</p><p><br></p><p>Zekram will pay. I will watch as his fancy little world crumbles around him and then I will reveal everything to him before he dies.</p><p><br></p><p>As I was thinking about this, the first guest arrived.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is a fine place you have built for yourself.” Azazel said as he stepped in. Shemhazai was following him too.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you have any trouble finding the place?”</p><p><br></p><p>“With the instructions you left outside and on the card, we would be idiots if we couldn’t find it. Naming a Bar Hell and the address as ‘Straight up from the Church’ couldn’t get anymore clear. By the way, you know that the Church people will be making a ruckus because of it.” Shemhazai laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>“You say that as if they wouldn’t make a ruckus as soon as my identity is revealed.” I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Touché.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So who else is coming?” Azazel asked as I sensed the others coming in.</p><p><br></p><p>Odin was here with Thor and our longtime friend, Sigurd who was followed by his wife, Brynhildr.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha now this is a way to live life. To be honest, if this idiot son of mine would take the throne, I would retire and open a bar for myself too. Maybe an Oppai Club like Azazel here.” Odin laughed boisterously, making Sigurd look abashed while Thor merely smiled. The woman in the group was offended though.</p><p><br></p><p>“Allfather, please pay attention to your behaviour.” She chided the man who looked unrepentant and then turned towards me. “Congratulations Damien. It’s good to see you doing well.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sigurd came and we shook hands.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you. Please enjoy the party. We are still waiting for a few guests.”</p><p><br></p><p>And the rest of the guests came soon enough.</p><p><br></p><p>“Damien. I am looking forward to a good fight when all this is done.” Thor said as he patted my back, making me smile wryly.</p><p><br></p><p>In the last year, since our alliance with the Norse was confirmed, I had been challenged by Thor several times. He was a total battle maniac. Like, he’d rather fight than eat or sleep if given a choice.</p><p><br></p><p>But all of that didn’t matter. What mattered is that the guy was a genuine beast when it came to fighting.</p><p><br></p><p>Like, I can see why he was called one of the Top Ten Strongest beings although that list itself was a massive sham.</p><p><br></p><p>He was able to push me when I wasn’t using my Denial of the Divine, forced me to use several of my skills while taking hits from my Conqueror’s Infused attacks and shrug them off while laughing boisterously.</p><p><br></p><p>“When all of this is over. Sure.” I smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Now, where is that student of mine?”</p><p><br></p><p>“This event is not exactly for kids. They are in the restaurant at the end of the street.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm seems fair. I will go and meet them after the party. You do have the booze for our party, right?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously.”</p><p><br></p><p>When I was visiting the Norse, Vienna came with me and she was followed by Akeno.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, my little sister was becoming a bit of a battle enthusiast herself and for this very reason was liked by many of the Norse people. They sparred with many of the young and even older Norse people.</p><p><br></p><p>During this, Akeno’s talent was seen by Thor and he took a liking to her and took her as an apprentice.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t think the girl had ever expected to be taught by Thor of all people. She agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>Since then both Vienna and Akeno have been visiting Valhalla and sometimes Thor comes to our base to teach them. He’s quite famous among the kids.</p><p><br></p><p>Our next group of guests arrived soon after.</p><p><br></p><p>Yasaka and Nurarihyon with several of their subordinates, especially from Nurarihyon’s side. They were a rowdy bunch who liked to party.</p><p><br></p><p>“Damien, congratulations on opening your dream place.” Yasaka smiled. I had once joked to her about having a dream of opening a bar.</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you. Enjoy yourself. You look quite stressed out.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. It’s been a tough few days.” She let out a sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>Things had been getting noisy with the attacks on the Youkai and the Five Principal Clans and they had been extremely busy recently. This was a good opportunity for them to let loose.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry, things will turn out well” I reassured her. At this point, it was the best I could do. I wasn’t going to tell her that I was planning to cull half the people who were a cause of her stress because they were my enemies too. At times like this, as a leader you must ensure maximum profit for your faction.</p><p><br></p><p>“We can only hope so.” She forced herself to smile and Nurarihyon greeted me.</p><p><br></p><p>“My boys have been looking forward to this party since we got the invitation. I hope you have prepared enough booze for everyone. We are going to drink this place dry hahahaha.”</p><p><br></p><p>“There’s more than enough for everyone and you will be having good competition from Thor. He’s already booked himself to drink everything here.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha are we afraid of challenges, boys? No we are not. So what if the God of thunder is stronger than us? We are not losing in terms of holding our liquor!”</p><p><br></p><p>Nurarihyon led his group to Odin who was leering at Yasaka and the woman was ignoring him as if he was air while she talked to a now fuming Brynhildr.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are there more people, Damien?” Azazel came and asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. A few more.” I smiled at the remaining ones. “Trust me. You will like it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Most definitely. And speak of <em>pfft</em> <em>the</em> Devil…” I looked towards the door, sensing the newest arrival.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>– Serafall Leviathan –</strong></p><p><br></p><p>A bar?</p><p><br></p><p>All of them had been just as confused as Sirzechs when he had told them about the invitation from the new Lucifer.</p><p><br></p><p>Why would <em>he</em> of all people open a bar of all things?</p><p><br></p><p>He hasn't shown head or tail for eight months and then he sends someone to Sirzechs' house and not just anyone but the reincarnation of Musashi Miyamoto.</p><p><br></p><p>Things had been changing for the better in the Underworld as more houses were included back into the council and the control of the Great King faction over the economy of the Underworld was relaxed a bit. They were still fighting off the returnees, especially those who hadn't accepted their invitation to join their faction.</p><p><br></p><p>But it was still better than before. Still, there were several things which could go wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>So, it was obviously a bit unnerving when someone who could overturn this entire situation just by taking a casual stroll through the streets of New Lilith, was inviting them to a party. This wasn't even a choice at this point for them. Not like they would reject the invitation anyway.</p><p><br></p><p>It was an opportunity to make better relationships with him and if that wasn't possible, then know more about their side.</p><p><br></p><p>Thus she decided to join the meeting. Grandmother Gremory and Lord Gremory were coming to talk about the yearly spar which was a whole other mess they didn't want to delve into at this point of time.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at the name and address of the Bar and couldn't help but let out a chuckle. \"At least he has a good sense of humour.\"</p><p><br></p><p>The scene in front of her was not something she was expecting from a bar opened by Lucifer.</p><p><br></p><p>There were obviously the Youkai but other people were completely unexpected.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Is that Odin? Thor? Does the boy have a connection with the Norse?\"</p><p><br></p><p>And not only the Norse. The one sitting beside Odin and leering at Yasaka who was promptly ignoring the duo made her lips twitch.</p><p><br></p><p>Obviously he would know. He had always been good at digging out information. And the guy had the audacity to disturb them about Rias' Boosted Gear. She would bet that he was laughing at them when he did so. It was just like that bastard.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Welcome. I am glad you all could make it here.\" Her thoughts were broken by a voice sounding beside her. She turned around and was frozen at the sight of the person standing there.</p><p><br></p><p>Grandmother Gremory and Lord Gremory were the same.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs was the one least affected because he had already encountered this situation before. \"Good to see you too, Damien. Thank you for inviting us. By the way, these are Serafall, the incharge of Foreign Affairs and the one currently holding the position of the Leviathan. Beside her is my Grandmother, Chysis Gremory and my Father, Zeoticus Gremory.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Welcome to my little piece of Hell hahaha. Also, no need to watch that Leviathan title around me. That would be for the Leviathan clan but then again it's not like you all took their permission when you started using the names. So why are you hesitating now?\"</p><p><br></p><p>She winced internally at the comment. Grandmother Gremory and Lord Gremory did the same. Especially Chysis. As someone who had seen and fought under the Original Satan's, to hear this from someone who was basically a living image of the Devil… It must be hard on a whole other level.</p><p><br></p><p>They had taken those titles as means to reassure the common people that they still had Satans. To give them some measure of moral support. Was it a low blow to the losing side? Most likely. But it did help them calm the general people to some extent.</p><p><br></p><p>Devils were a long lived race and there were still too many older devils alive even among the low and middle class ones who would not accept any other leader than the Satans ruling over the Underworld.</p><p><br></p><p>Was it completely selfless? Not at all. There were several older pillar devils who relished in the power of having a say about these names. Everyone knew this. It was just not spoken.</p><p><br></p><p>So, when faced with such a statement, it was obvious to dig up some guilty conscience of a devil of the older generation like Chysis.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Come, take a seat. I am still waiting for some guests but it seems they will be late.\" He said as he led them to the table which was occupied by the leaders.</p><p><br></p><p>They took their seats and she could see the surprised look on Azazel's face. So he didn't know that they were invited too. The look however turned into a smug one and now she wanted to bash his face again.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Serafall, Sirzechs, what a surprise to see you both here.\" He greeted us.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Azazel. You knew?\" Sirzechs asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Knew? About this meeting? Well obviously. I think you forgot a very common fact. Damien and I <em>are</em> family.”</p><p><br></p><p>A family who have fought a war spanning throughout the world. Then again, wasn’t the Great War, just a glorified family feud between the three factions?</p><p><br></p><p>“You seem to get along well with him.” Sirzechs spoke as a purple haired Fallen Angel served drinks to all of them. A Fallen Angel?</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh Celine. You are working here too?” Shemhazai asked the waitress, surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I liked the atmosphere here. I play the guitar for the show.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha you were always good with the harp back in heaven. It’s good to see you taking back to playing instruments.”</p><p><br></p><p>“She is?” She couldn’t help but ask, seeing the Vice-Governor of the Fallen Angels being so familiar with her.</p><p><br></p><p>But the answer came from someone else entirely.</p><p><br></p><p>“Celine of the Holy Flames. It was thought that you had perished back in the Great War because you had disappeared. To think I would see you after so long.” Grandmother Gremory said.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are… the little girl from the Gremory who followed that bratty devil. Yes, this is indeed a surprise. How is your ancestor doing? Still playing around with those camels of hers?” The Fallen Angel replied.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Now, even she knew that there were very few people who would call the first Gremory by such a name so it was evident that this Fallen was someone pretty high up and seeing the unphased reaction meant that her words weren’t something new.</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes even she, as a Satan, forgot how ancient most of these beings were.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. She’s just retired now.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. Tell her to drop by someday. It would be good to talk to her under different circumstances.” She replied. “If you will excuse me. I have a show to perform now.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure. It was… good to see you too, Celine.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. It was not exactly bad.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Mother, she was?” Lord Gremory inquired, just as curious as them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Celine, the Daughter of Archangel Uriel. She was one of the most talented Angels back during the Great War, under only the Seraphs and rivalling even them in terms of power. Both of our Ancestors have fought her several times without any results during the Great War, especially yours Serafall whose powers were completely opposite to hers.” She looked at her before saying the last part. “And then after the Great War, news about her suddenly stopped as if she had disappeared suddenly. Not something uncommon during those times. “I didn’t know she had fallen. But why is she working for a Lucifer?”</p><p><br></p><p>Uriel had a daughter? She hadn’t heard about it.</p><p><br></p><p>Shemhazai sighed. “She was caught in an ambush and fell. Heaven rejected her. When she came down, she was captured by the Old Satan faction and had been imprisoned there for centuries. Damien found and freed her along with several hundred other Fallen Angel captives. She was barely a living corpse when he found her. He treated her, got her any kind of help she needed to properly heal her mind. By the end of it, she decided to live with him.”</p><p><br></p><p>“They had prisoners of war? I thought it was decided to free prisoners from all sides when we decided to stop the war.” She asked. They had actually freed a lot of them after coming into power. One of the reasons why none of the factions attacked them at their weakest.</p><p><br></p><p>“We didn’t have any ways to know who was dead and who was alive.” Shemhazai let out a sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>“I would have thought that she would have joined the Fallen Angels rather than devils especially after her time in captivity.” Grandmother Gremory said.</p><p><br></p><p>“The ambush which caused her to fall… It was done by one of the Fallen Angels. Penemue is already out for blood. The whole matter was such a mess.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah… that’s… yes. Those were not good times.”<br><br>“Still, I didn’t think you all would have such good relations with Damien, you know, what with him being a Lucifer and all that. It’s just surprising.” She said.</p><p><br></p><p>At this point, Shemhazai looked at her and then smiled. “Tell me Serafall, what do you all know about Lucifer? And I mean Lucifer before his rebellion? I will not lie, Lucifer as a devil was scary. He was insane. A twisted version of what we knew of him. But… do you know how or what Lucifer was like before his rebellion?</p><p><br></p><p>She shook her head.</p><p><br></p><p>“Helel was the brightest Angel of Heaven. Dad’s favourite. In fact, compared to him, Michael was basically a middle child. He was strong and charismatic. Someone at whom most of us looked up to. Hahahaha, not many know of this but He was the next in line for the position of the King of Heaven if Dad ever retired.”</p><p><br></p><p>He laughed, making her mouth open in shock.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, that brat was Yahweh’s loyal attack dog. Always ready to wipe out any heretic or pagan God as they say. Old times. I personally like the new one better.” Odin remarked.</p><p><br></p><p>“To be honest, if he had rebelled and stayed the way he was, then even as a Fallen Angel, at least a third of Heaven would have followed him but… he didn’t fall.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. It’s a very less known fact. He was the only one who didn’t fall. No. He left voluntarily. The rest of us were kicked out.” He laughed at their confused look. </p><p><br></p><p>“Do you know why despite being against Dad, we never banded together? Why are there three factions instead of just Heaven and the rebels? Well, a part of it was that whatever he had become, we were scared of him. The very presence of The Devil repulsed us. But a large part of it was also Jealousy. How can he throw a tantrum and still not fall while we were kicked out of heaven for a small mistake? How could he reject what we craved for but couldn’t get? We were jealous and angry and the new Lucifer didn’t make it easier. Seeing the bright and loving brother of ours turn into that… that abomination… we were just angry. So yes. We were just being kids. And you already know how kids sort things out between themselves?”</p><p><br></p><p>“And Damien?”</p><p><br></p><p>“He is exactly what Lucifer would have been if he hadn’t become what he had.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>There was a reminiscing look in his eyes and no one among them disturbed his thoughts. But it did give them a whole new insight into the man who created their race.</p><p><br></p><p>All their thoughts were attracted by the shifting stage as three figures appeared on the stage. One of them was the one they had just met, Fallen Angel Celine. The other two were different. A man who looked to be in his twenties with long white hair sat on the piano. He seemed like a normal human but Lord Gremory and Grandmother Gremory seemed to have different opinions.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is that?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.” Azazel smirked.</p><p><br></p><p>That man was probably here just to laugh at them.</p><p><br></p><p>“But how? As far as we knew he would never ally himself with Devils.”</p><p><br></p><p>“With normal devils, maybe not. But as Damien says, he is ‘The Devil’. Even we don’t know how he did it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Who is he, father?” Sirzechs asked, taking another look at the man.</p><p><br></p><p>“Merlin.”</p><p><br></p><p>\"Merlin… you mean <em>that</em> Merlin?\" She asked, taking another look at the man.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then again, he’s half brothers with Damien. They get along pretty well. I thought you’d be more interested in the last one.” Azazel commented, as they looked at the last person. The girl who was the singer of the group. Light purple hair, golden eyes. She looked to be in her teens, maybe sixteen.</p><p><br></p><p>It was when she tried to feel her power that she got chills. Not just her. All three of them. But this girl was still heads and shoulders above them all.</p><p><br></p><p>“Who is she?” She asked, incredulously. Just how many of these monsters did this guy have? This would make seven or eight already. And each one of them was stronger than her.</p><p><br></p><p>This girl… she was almost approaching the levels of Ajuka and Sirzechs. Another one of those and one who was with the new Lucifer.</p><p><br></p><p>As if realising something, she looked around and checked everyone in the building and the observation sent chills down her spine. Not a single staff member was below Ultimate Class level in strength.</p><p><br></p><p>There were over a hundred staff in the entire building. The stronger ones were beyond Satan Class.</p><p><br></p><p>Azazel took this chance to throw another bomb as if all the existing ones were not enough already.  </p><p><br></p><p>“Ingvild Leviathan.”</p><p><br></p><p>Fuck!</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly something struck her. Is that why he laughed when Sirzechs introduced her?</p><p><br></p><p>He knew she would find out about her today.</p><p><br></p><p>She turned towards Sirzechs. “But didn’t you say…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. I was also under the impression that she had fallen under the Sleeping sickness.\" He replied and looked at Azazel who raised his hands in surrender. \"I don't know anything about that. It's totally on Damien.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Could it be? Did he find a cure for the Sleeping sickness?</p><p><br></p><p>If that was so then….</p><p><br></p><p>The performance started but it didn’t reach her as she was too busy trying to comprehend the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>While this was happening, a blue haired boy walked up to Azazel and spoke. “Normally we have a no pictures rule in this bar but Boss has decided to make an exception for you today for a million dollars. Will you take it?”</p><p><br></p><p>Shemhazai almost spit out his beer at the offer and even she looked incredulously at him. What kind of insane idiot would take that offer?</p><p><br></p><p>Although a million dollars is nothing for Supernaturals like them, it was still quite dumb.</p><p><br></p><p>The man boy added. “The Boss says you will not regret it.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Azazel -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He was having the time of his life, looking at the reactions of the two Satan brats and their companions.</p><p><br></p><p>In his opinion, this was more interesting than any other show which could be put in the bar. Their expressions were priceless.</p><p><br></p><p>And yet, now Damien says he would not regret using a million to buy picture rights for a night… He closed his eyes to think of what could be so amusing.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly it hit him. He couldn’t be that crazy, could he?</p><p><br></p><p>… obviously he was that crazy. It was The Devil. Was there even a doubt?</p><p><br></p><p>He brought out his mobile and transferred the amount without question. “I want to welcome them myself.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sean brought out a camera from his pocket and handed it to him. “Obviously, Boss knew you would say so already. Have fun.”</p><p><br></p><p>With his work done, the boy left.</p><p><br></p><p>“That was Lugh’s brat, wasn’t he? He looks much stronger than before.” Odin inquired. “He was training with Brynhildr I think.” He looked at the Valkyrie who nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. He left a year ago but comes back once in a while.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. Still, to think he would get that of all things. It seems that Damien values him a lot. The Child of Light and the Lightbringer hahahaha. Even their names match.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What are you talking about, Old man?” Azazel asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“That Spear of your Father. The boy had it.”</p><p><br></p><p>*<em>Crash</em>*</p><p><br></p><p>The glass in Serafall’s hand fell down and crashed into the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>Even he was surprised at the reveal and took another look at the boy who was waiting at the tables.</p><p><br></p><p>Damien was hiding too many surprises it seems.</p><p><br></p><p>As he was thinking of this, he sensed something and a playful look came on his face as he got up and walked towards the gate of the bar.</p><p><br></p><p>“Where are you going, Azazel?” Behind him, Shemhazai asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Just receiving someone.”</p><p><br></p><p>The door to the bar opened and a figure stood in front of him and Azazel allowed his grin to take over his face. “Hello Michael.”</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Join me on my Discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/RNNZyyert4</a></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><strong><br>A lot of things happened in the chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The Shinto are becoming wary of the Youkai and have decided to make some moves through others.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Satanael is out and so are Augusta and Walburga, Damien’s last targets.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Musashi gave the Gremorys a reality check.

Why do we have to suffer for those humans?” He struck the target for the umpteenth time as he fell on his knees, only to bash the ground with his bare fists… again.</p><p><br></p><p>I was in one of the dreams. The memories of Lucifer or God… at this point I couldn’t even tell. This one however was a very different one.</p><p><br></p><p>I could feel the tension from the start.</p><p><br></p><p>Lucifer’s or rather Helel’s mother was sealed away behind their backs. Only Michael and Helel were old enough.</p><p><br></p><p>She was affecting the humans according to God and would have become a great danger to the world so he had to seal her.</p><p><br></p><p>It came out of nowhere for me who had just gotten used to the fact that they even had a mother to even begin with.</p><p><br></p><p>Michael and Helel were both shocked but while Michael didn’t voice out anything, trusting his Father’s judgement, Helel was another beast altogether.</p><p><br></p><p>I saw him trying to vent out his frustrations endlessly.</p><p><br></p><p>But something changed finally. I saw a sense of light return to his eyes. “Yes. That’s right. I just need to show Father how those Humans aren’t worthy of his love and care. Mother has been nothing but loving to us. How can she be a danger to anyone? It must have been the fault of those humans. They lie, they cheat and take pleasure in the pain of others. They are sinful. How can they even compare to us?”</p><p><br></p><p>And with that everything faded to white.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>I opened my eyes but my mood was not good. Several thoughts went around in my head as I recalled the dream once more.</p><p><br></p><p>Desperate people do desperate things.</p><p><br></p><p>I think I just saw a glimpse of the reason why Helel rebelled.</p><p><br></p><p>I shook my head and got up.</p><p><br></p><p>Gretel was still asleep and hugging my chest.</p><p><br></p><p>She had been too exhausted… emotionally and went for the whole time till she fell asleep in my arms yesterday.</p><p><br></p><p>We came back after the incident in Romania. The first thing I did was comfort Gretel and then take Valerie to Merlin.</p><p><br></p><p>I also took this opportunity to touch the Graal and was assaulted with tons of memories. The Sacred Gear most attuned to souls coming in contact with someone like me with a fragmented soul… the effects were comparable to the True Longinus. It’s just that I was stronger too so I didn’t faint this time.</p><p><br></p><p>That said the effects truly were something.</p><p><br></p><p>I gained almost two Satans worth of Demonic Power with my soul almost healed. My total Demonic Power was now almost twelve times stronger than a Peak Satan Class like Serafall. I was now stronger than Rizevim in terms of sheer Demonic Power. I also gained two more Binder marks.</p><p><br></p><p>That reminded me.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs being ten times as strong as Lucifer was a lie.</p><p><br></p><p>He was strong no doubt.</p><p><br></p><p>The strongest Devil I had met.</p><p><br></p><p>Fifteen times stronger than a Peak Satan Class. Which would make him only five times stronger than Lucifer if the information that I got from Azazel was true.</p><p><br></p><p>He was keeping most of his powers sealed but I used my Prince of Lies to sense it.</p><p><br></p><p>He was still almost one and a half times stronger than Rizevim and I can see why people would even believe it.</p><p><br></p><p>Propaganda was a powerful tool.</p><p><br></p><p>After all, the only ones who knew about the true extent of Lucifer’s power would either not speak or just not be heard by anyone.</p><p><br></p><p>With this, I can at least provide my people some backing to stand in front of the world.</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully, Merlin had also finished negotiating with the Norse and the Fallen Angels and while the Fallen Angels weren’t currently ready to support us openly, they were going to declare a peace like that between the three factions.</p><p><br></p><p>My shaking awakened Gretel and I saw her opening her ruby red eyes to me again.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good morning.” I removed the bangs covering her face and kissed her forehead. “Are you better now?”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>I felt her gripping me tighter and laid back on the bed as I hugged her tighter while slowly rubbing her back. Neither of us talked.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Sirzechs -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He reached home with Grayfia and Rias.</p><p><br></p><p>The first thing he had done was get Rias checked for any spells or problems. Ajuka had spent over two hours and after rechecking twice, found nothing wrong with her.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the Sacred Gear was attached to her perfectly as if she had carried it from birth.</p><p><br></p><p>The power to remove and bestow Sacred Gears like this… the more he thought about it, the more headaches he had. Especially when he considered who this power was in the hands of.</p><p><br></p><p>Grayfia was barely going through the routine like a zombie at this point. Her head was still filled up with all the information she had heard last night.</p><p><br></p><p>She insisted on staying back until he was done with the meeting and he knew that she would do just that but he couldn’t find it in himself to force her to do it. So, he used Rias as an excuse to push the meeting with the fellow Satans aside for a while and brought them home, right from Ajuka’s place when the check ups were completed.</p><p><br></p><p>“You all are back. Was the trip a success?” His mother asked but stopped when she noticed the looks on his and Grayfia’s faces. “Did something happen?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Mother, do we have a pervert in our basement?” Rias interrupted before he could say anything and he felt the urge to facepalm.</p><p><br></p><p>How did he even know of her being alive? It was one of the best kept secrets of the Gremory family.</p><p><br></p><p>“A what?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Rias, go and get cleaned up first. We can talk when we sit for dinner.” He interrupted, not wanting to start this conversation right now.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at him and then nodded, leaving the room quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>“What’s all this about? And are you alright Grayfia?” She called out but to no reply. “Grayfia?” She called out again.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.” Grayfia was broken out from her reverie, shocked by the voice.</p><p><br></p><p>“We need to talk about today. Can you please inform father?” He asked, tired and his mother nodded having understood the oddity of the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>He led Grayfia into their room and hugged her as soon as he closed the door.</p><p><br></p><p>And she finally broke down.</p><p><br></p><p>To be honest, he was a bit lost at what to say at this moment because he knew that no amount of words would help.</p><p><br></p><p>But he had to try.</p><p><br></p><p>“Your mother covered for you because she wanted you out of that place, Grayfia. Don’t blame yourself for what happened. You didn’t know. We didn’t know.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But I… I never even questioned it. Euclid said that he had buried her but I never checked.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You thought that her body was destroyed. No one could have guessed he did such a thing.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I failed them. I failed my mother. I failed Euclid. I failed my other siblings. I don’t even know? Did they even get any names? How could Euclid… how could he?”</p><p><br></p><p>He felt his own fists clench down when he remembered this. Three children were experimented on and killed and only one survived.</p><p><br></p><p>Why did they fight the war in the first place? Wasn’t it to prevent just that from happening? He remembered his own students’ death before he stepped into the war.</p><p><br></p><p>But he couldn’t even imagine the amount of pain she must be in right now. Just like he couldn’t imagine how it would feel to know that three of his siblings were killed while another one tortured.</p><p><br></p><p>“He did whatever he did on his own. You cannot control everything. We cannot change the past, Grayfia but we can make the future better. You still have a family. You can try connecting to her.” He said. He did hope they would connect, not only to remove some of her guilt but also to make bridges between the two sides.</p><p><br></p><p>But Grayfia shook her head.</p><p><br></p><p>“She won’t. No. She absolutely won’t. She hates Euclid. She hates me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I know you can mend the relationship, Grayfia.” He tried to encourage her.</p><p><br></p><p>But she shook her head. “You don’t understand. She will never…”</p><p><br></p><p>A pit formed in his stomach.</p><p><br></p><p>Her voice came out as a whisper. “Euclid was raising her to be… me. In everything. When she couldn’t, she was tortured, not even allowed to cry. And when she did succeed… it became worse.”</p><p><br></p><p>He felt the pit in his stomach become worse.</p><p><br></p><p>“He… Euclid probably… touched… molested her when she was a child.” He felt his breath stuck. “They were planning to brainwash her into an obedient puppet. If it wasn’t for Damien… I lost the chance when I tried to stop her attack on him. That look of pain and hurt… She will never forgive me.” Her words turned into sobs and tears flowed endlessly.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs quickly hugged her tightly and let her rest.</p><p><br></p><p>“How could he… how could he become such a monster. It’s like the brother I knew was just an illusion.”</p><p><br></p><p>He couldn’t even find words to say anymore.</p><p><br></p><p>He knew that the things were bad but he didn’t know they were like this.</p><p><br></p><p>A part of him understood why Damien reacted the way he did because he was sure that he would have just erased that bastard if he had done anything like that to someone he loved, consequences be damned.</p><p><br></p><p>It also explained the fanatical loyalty he had seen in the eyes of Gretel for Damien.</p><p><br></p><p>He kept holding her till her breathing evened out and she fell asleep.</p><p><br></p><p>He lay her quietly in their bed, used a spell to change her clothes and pulled the blanket over her.</p><p><br></p><p></p><p></p><p><br></p><p>“How is Grayfia now?” His mother asked when he sat down. The only ones in the room, apart from him, were his parents.</p><p><br></p><p>“She is… sleeping.” He picked up a bottle of scotch for the day. Tea wouldn’t cut it.</p><p><br></p><p>“Rias told us about what had happened.” His father spoke but he could sense that he was uneasy.</p><p><br></p><p>“About the deal she made?” He asked and his father nodded, joining him with another glass.</p><p><br></p><p>“Your father apparently realised just how utterly stupid the entire plan was from the very beginning.” His mother mocked, sitting beside him.</p><p><br></p><p>“I…” His father just sighed at this point.</p><p><br></p><p>While he didn’t agree with his father’s plan, he had to agree with this reaction. If by any chance, Rias did what Damien had asked and went public with her comment, there would have been a riot and he was not even exaggerating this.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did he… was he really… you know, a Lucifer?” His father asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs shook his head. “Even worse.” He downed his glass in one gulp. “Damien Lucifer Asmodeus.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh Satans!”</p><p><br></p><p>“He is a devil created from the blood of Lucifer and Asmodeus. Rizevim’s half brother and probably the most talented Devil to ever walk the world.” He explained whatever happened in yesterday’s meeting briefly to his parents.</p><p><br></p><p>By the end of it all, they were stunned to even form words.</p><p><br></p><p>“So… Lord Lucifer… he was killed…” His father asked, as if still not being able to comprehend the statement.</p><p><br></p><p>“And the Leviathan, yes. He did. He confessed to it himself along with everything else.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No one would ever believe it even if we said it out loud and instead would accuse us.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously, they won’t.” He sighed while gulping the entire glass of the alcohol in one go.</p><p><br></p><p>“Where does he stand? The new Lucifer, I mean.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I… don’t know. He doesn’t bear any hostility towards us but… he isn’t very fond of the idea of joining us either. According to him, the current government is a sinking ship and with the number of things he told me… I’m inclined to believe him.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What things?”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at his mother directly and asked. “Please tell me honestly, did you both know that the Sleeping Sickness was artificially created?” He observed their expressions closely and the shock he saw on their faces was genuine.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s what?!”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am going to need to investigate this but around a hundred years or so ago, Ingrid Leviathan was attacked by Devils, not from the Old Satan Faction because they didn’t even know of her being alive. Her daughter who was a half devil was sent away but caught the Sleeping sickness. Damien investigated and found out that the disease is artificially created. You can understand the implications of this. If the ones who attacked them and inflicted them with the disease were indeed someone from the current government, how can we ever hope for him to trust us? There were several other things that were revealed and I am going to have to investigate everything or what he said would come true. The Devil race <em>will</em> be doomed.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What about Rias?” His mother asked to break a period of silence which had descended over the room.</p><p><br></p><p>“He gave her the Boosted Gear in return for her to become a rival to his sister. But in his own words, it was the last thing the Lucifer House would ever do for the Devil race. I don’t even know what to think of this guy. He’s…”</p><p><br></p><p>Pouring another glass of scotch, he continued, “I don’t know how to explain it. The boy had confidence like every member of the Lucifer house, pride obviously but it was as if he kept it tightly wrapped around himself. And that prideful look was natural for him as if he would be incomplete without it. There was this charisma in every word he said that just compelled one to believe in him. More than once I checked myself to see if he was using any spells on me but he wasn’t. But there was just nothing I could do to refute him, almost as if I didn’t want to.”</p><p><br></p><p>He chuckled. “Even when he called himself ‘The Devil’, I couldn’t refute it because it just felt… true.” He downed the second glass.</p><p><br></p><p>“And I am supposed to be the Lucifer. I don’t know how the real Lucifer was, but if he was anything like Damien, I can see why people feared him and still respect him till this day. It wasn’t about power. It was his entire presence. It was like I was standing in front of a King and the most natural thing I could do was kneel and pay homage.”</p><p><br></p><p>His parents looked at him in stunned quietness.</p><p><br></p><p>“If I had to choose an enemy, I would gladly fight ten of Rizevims rather than one of Damien, because then I won’t have to strain my will to stand.” He kept his glass on the table and got up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh and he also gave Rias another option in which, I quote, ‘will have to have a chat with a little midget with a camel fetish sleeping in our basement.’”</p><p><br></p><p>He left while his parents had an open mouthed reaction.</p><p><br><br></p><p></p><p></p><p><br><br></p><p>“So, Rias is now the Red Dragon Empress.” Serafall asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“He just handed over a Longinus to your sister.” Falbium asked to confirm.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t get it. Do you think he is trying to get our goodwill? Still, giving away a Longinus?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Why would he even care? He is a fourteen year old Super Devil. A fucking Super Devil when he hasn’t even reached eighteen. And if that wasn’t enough, he can somehow negate the Demonic Power of other devils. How did they even make such a monster?”</p><p><br></p><p>“And Grayfia’s sister?”</p><p><br></p><p>“She was beyond any normal Satan class being. Not quite at the level of Rizevim but she was definitely beyond Grayfia by a huge margin. Several times even.”</p><p><br></p><p>Serafall stifled.</p><p><br></p><p>“And she is…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Around eighteen.”</p><p><br></p><p>“On top of this, he has a Satan Class magician who also has a Longinus. Is he collecting those things? If so, how many does he have that he gave away one of those so easily? Not to mention, that would make at least four Satan Class or above beings on their side. That’s already more dangerous than the Old Satan faction.” Ajuka asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t know.”</p><p><br></p><p>“How is Grayfia doing now?” Serafall asked, letting out a sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>“She is with Milicas. I ordered her to stay there so that she doesn’t keep thinking about it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s going to be hard. Even I didn't think they would be that crazy.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Rizevim killed Lucifer and Leviathan, was this really out of character for him?” He countered and she became silent.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you know about the Sleeping Sickness, Ajuka?” He finally asked the question which had been eating away at him.</p><p><br></p><p>“... I did have my doubts. I was never allowed to research souls when I tried to cure the disease. That sparked my suspicion more so I checked the list of everyone who contracted the disease and found out that most of them were either in opposition of the Great King faction or someone who could become a power in the Underworld. Around 60% of the victims caused the Great King faction to profit in one way or the other.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But aunt Misla…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Contracted the disease when Sairaorg was found without the ability to use Demonic Power and was almost exiled from the House. She is the younger sister of the Vapula Head, a Duke and the main wife. It would have caused a scandal if he had raised any voice despite the prestige of Baels. The fact that Misla Bael fell into the Sleeping Sickness removed any chances of that happening and gave Lord Bael a legitimate excuse to make his concubine the main wife and his other son the Heir. Lord Vapula wouldn’t be able to complain even if he wanted to because without Misla’s word, he wouldn’t have any foot to stand on.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What about the houses which were bankrupted and declared extinct?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Over twenty. There are still surviving members of the families who have inherited the family Trait can carry on the name of the House.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What are they doing now?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Mostly trying to live. Many have taken to leaving for the Human World while some are working for other houses. What are you planning?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Find them all. Provide them with the Rank of high Class Devils again and allow them to form peerages to help them assimilate with the current devil society. Revive the houses. Give me the list. I will do it myself.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And do you think the ones who put them in such a place will allow you to? Increasing the number of seats again will mean less power for each of the existing members. They will revolt and suppress you with all their might.” Serafall retorted.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s not like they are not doing that already. But we don’t have the options anymore. Rizevim is going to make a move and even if this is not against us, it has the potential to envelop all of us. If these houses join the other side, we will be facing a massive civil war all over again however this war will be far worse than the last one. The Reincarnated Devils will be taking part and we all know how they have been treated. They certainly will not be standing up for us.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t you think you are overreacting a bit, Sirzechs?” Falbium asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Am I? Then where do we stand right now according to you, Sera? Heaven and the Church have suddenly gained a Super Class Angel and sooner or later, Heaven’s system will be up and running better than ever. Fallen Angels, while divided and the lowest in population, still have the best relations with other factions. While we, on the other hand, our reputation is down in the dumps. Even our race is divided into several parts which are at each other’s throats at all times.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s not that bad…”</p><p><br></p><p>“The Reincarnated Devils were supposed to be the key to save our society and despite them being the majority of Ultimate Class Devils in terms of numbers, they are still treated badly. What do you think will happen if news revealing the truth of the Sleeping Sickness is revealed? Dozens of houses will revolt. Taking advantage of this chaos, the Reincarnated Devils will revolt as well. How many do you think we can keep in check? Tell me Ajuka, according to you, if the four of us die, how many years can the Devil Race last?”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Ajuka looked at him expressionlessly. “If you die, twenty eight years. If I die, twenty three years. If both of us die, fourteen years. If all of us die, five years.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t think you two understand. The ramifications of the unregulated use of Evil Pieces has been atrocious to our reputation.” stated Serafall. \"If we didn't have you two as a deterrent, it would be great if we could last a year. Everybody with the possible exception of Heaven and the Grigori wants to see us done and dusted and even those two want to see us culled a bit.\"</p><p><br></p><p>“We need to make some major changes. Even if I die, I don’t want my son and little sister to suffer in another one of those wars.”</p><p><br></p><p>The room descended into an uncomfortable silence.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did he tell you anyway we can contract him?” Serafall asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“He said that he will bring his sister for a yearly spar with Rias and that I should only call him if or when… I am cleaning house.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Yasaka -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Control the flames and reign it in more.” She commented as she sat on the porch, combing Kunou’s tails.</p><p><br></p><p>Akira had been growing at a phenomenal rate. He had mastered the illusions of the Kitsune quite well and was working towards learning Fox Fire to a high degree of mastery. He would be a Nine Tailed fox soon at this rate.</p><p><br></p><p>She knew that his progress was greatly connected with whatever Damein Lucifer had done to him.</p><p><br></p><p>A part of her wished that she had been a bit more stubborn and insisted on bringing back his sister to see if she could have reached a similar height.</p><p><br></p><p>“Great. Now take some rest. We will start your lessons on politics in an hour.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you, Lady Yasaka.”</p><p><br></p><p>Two of her Tengu guards were standing a little distance away.</p><p><br></p><p>“You two get in. Akira, try using your Haki on them. You both will try to resist and spar with each other.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, Lady Yasaka.”</p><p><br></p><p>A terrifying aura shot out from Akira and crushed the two Tengu in their places. They almost crumbed to their knees, barely holding their consciousness together.</p><p><br></p><p>They had been undergoing this kind of training for almost a month now, ever since she got the agreement to train her people in Haki.</p><p><br></p><p>Conqueror’s Haki, the Haki of the Kings, was something which left a deep impression on the minds of everyone who noticed the fight against Nue. Be it young ones or the older generations. A Skill which rendered numbers useless was something which required proper respect.</p><p><br></p><p>Although she herself hadn’t been able to awaken the talent yet, according to Akira, it was very likely that she and Nurarihyon had the talent for the Skill.</p><p><br></p><p>A minute later, he released the Haki and the ones who were still conscious took the others away.</p><p><br></p><p>Soon Akira left to take a rest and she was left with her own thoughts.</p><p><br></p><p>Kyoto had been stabilised because other factions were wary of poking the hidden power but only she knew that there were no new hidden powers.</p><p><br></p><p>The reveal of the new Sage in Kuroka also helped with this. She had also let slip that they had another person, her secret disciple, whose identity they didn’t know. The appearance of an Eight Tailed Fox Youkai was hard to miss too.</p><p><br></p><p>But she knew that this was only temporary. These people were only looking for openings and would jump at her if given any openings to prevent any faction from rising up. Especially the Onmyoji, both the Five Principal Clans and the Seimei Clan who were staring from the side to jump at the opportunity.</p><p><br></p><p>The Shinto were wary of the sudden rise of the power of the Youkai. The only good subordinates are those who can be controlled easily. This was practised by Shinto quite religiously. The Five Principal Clans and the Youkai were pit against each other to keep them in control and under a certain level to not be a threat to the Pantheon itself.</p><p><br></p><p>But now that there was supposedly someone who could pose a danger to the Shinto behind the Kyoto Youkai, not to mention the rising power of the Youkai, she wondered if things would be the same.</p><p><br></p><p>She was probably lucky that the new inheritors of the Sacred Beasts were young and haven’t reached their full potential yet, giving her some time to stabilise things.</p><p><br></p><p>What she needed to do now was build up her strength to a level where the Youkai can shrug off any of the Shinto’s moves without any problems.</p><p><br></p><p>And the one she could think about who would allow them to reach such a level, this quickly was him….</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Venalana Gremory -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She watched as her daughter guided her attacks expertly to any moving target at a moment’s notice.</p><p><br></p><p>It had been a week since the day she returned home with a new servant and the Boosted Gear of all things from the new Lucifer… or rather Lucifer Asmodeus.</p><p><br></p><p>The name was strange to her even now.</p><p><br></p><p>But even stranger were perhaps his powers.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias might have thought that he was joking when he gave her the so-called Devil’s Kiss but after observing her training in the past few days, Venelana found that everything he said was true. She had conducted a few tests on Rias by giving her exercises and different types of magic to learn and found that she could learn almost anything with ease. Her comprehension power also increased alongside her strength.</p><p><br></p><p>Her magical reserves had increased by about thirty percent. She was growing stronger much faster than before, already reaching the cusps of a High Class Devil at her age even without her new Longinus.</p><p><br></p><p>This blessing was probably much more valuable than a Longinus and it made her wonder if Damien could do this for everyone. If it was so, she could understand why he gave up a Longinus to Rias so easily.</p><p><br></p><p>Ajuka and Sirzechs both had been extremely busy since he returned from Romania. And Grayfia… she had barely spoken to anyone outside work.</p><p><br></p><p>“She is progressing quite fast.” She heard a voice behind her and turned to see her mother-in-law, Chysis walking towards her.</p><p><br></p><p>Looking back at her daughter, she replied. “Yes. Several times faster even. It’s…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Scary? Yes, yes it is. Zeo told me everything about the incident. Little Rias has taken after him in personality. Both are stubborn people. He should have eased her into the news about the engagement rather than just throw it at her. Especially when both Rias and Riser have strong personalities.”</p><p><br></p><p>“He was very excited about the prospects of having another grandchild to actually think properly. He only realised how badly things could have gone if Rias had actually decided to take the advice of the young Lucifer.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, the new Lucifer. That face… and those words would have isolated the Gremory House with casual ease. It’s hard to believe that such a person is only fourteen.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It is.” She replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“Rias seems to have a crush on him too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“She does. From the first time she saw him. I don’t blame her. He seems to be quite a heart-throb.” She replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“His ancestor was the Archangel of Desire for a reason. I dare say if Lilith hadn’t been the competition, he would have had a bigger harem than the Asmodeus. I remember having a crush on him too.” Her mother-in-law laughed, making her smile.</p><p><br></p><p>“It doesn’t help that he has the blood of Asmodeus too… along with both their powers.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh? I didn’t hear about <em>that</em> bit.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The Blue Flames of Asmodeus, the highest level of Passion Flames. He used it during the meeting.”</p><p><br></p><p>“... and he apparently knew about Ancestor too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We have no idea how. All the servants were questioned but we didn’t find anything.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Servants couldn’t have known, dear. I personally selected the ones who serve. They have been raised by the Gremory House since childhood. There was never a chance of them selling out. What did the Phenex say about the engagement? Did Zeo talk to them?”</p><p><br></p><p>“We are planning to just let Rias decide everything in the Rating Game. There is no chance of her losing anyway. We still haven’t disclosed anything from our end to avoid offending the Lucifer.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Good. Do you know when the spar between Rias and his sister was organised?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Not yet.” She looked at her mother-in-law, trying to guess what was going on in her mind.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tell me when it happens. I want to meet him along with Zeo.”</p><p><br></p><p>“... alright.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Train Rias in the meanwhile. No matter his reasons, a Longinus is a frightening power. Especially the one containing the soul of the Red Dragon Emperor. I had been one of the people who was involved in the fight against the Heavenly Dragons. That kind of power… you have to see it on your own to know. Don’t let it go to waste.”</p><p><br></p><p>“... are things really that bad?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Rizevim Livan Lucifer is one of the very few people I would never want to offend and it’s not because of his strength. If he is making moves, then we better take every precaution we can. Whether she likes it or not, she will be dragged into whatever is coming next, as will the rest of the Devil race. And when that happens… I would want my family to be as strong as they can be.” Her mother-in-law spoke calmly but it only made her sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>Why were things suddenly turning out like this?</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Azazel -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Here’s the information from our spies in Romania.” Shemhazai threw the file to him and he took a look. He already knew what was inside.</p><p><br></p><p>“It was him, wasn’t it? The times match too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. The entire city, forest and even beyond that. He became stronger. Then again, he did have Razevan’s power so hiding his real power was easy for him.” He thought to himself aloud.</p><p><br></p><p>“What are the Vampires saying?” Penemue asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nothing.” Shemhazai replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“Excuse me?”</p><p><br></p><p>“They said nothing. They are pretending as if nothing happened.” </p><p><br></p><p>“Well of course they will. Someone came in and knocked out everyone in their territory with a single move, what do you think people would say if they found out about it? They would become a running joke. Not to mention the Carmila faction are looking for any chances to snoop in.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What was he even doing there?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I didn’t get a chance to talk to him but from what Merlin said, some of his people were recruiting someone there and things seem to have gone wrong.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Actually… Sirzechs Lucifer seems to have been around the area too. Do you think?” Barakiel said.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs?</p><p><br></p><p>“I… don’t know. I will have to ask him. Actually, I think I have the perfect reason to visit him too.” He smiled looking at the message he had just received.</p><p><br></p><p>“Leaving it aside, what are you planning to do with those Wizards of Oz and Utsusemi Agency making a move, Azazel? Not to mention, Sataneel has been quite suspicious too.” Penemue pointed out and he could sense the hostility in the last part of her words.</p><p><br></p><p>She had been happy enough to meet Celine but that only increased her hostility towards Sataneel. Not to mention, Sataneel <em>was</em> moving suspiciously.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have something in mind.”</p><p><br></p><p>The utsusemi Agency was a cesspool of political crap to handle. On one hand, they were exiled from the Principal Clans so they don’t take any responsibility for their actions but on the other hand, they could always claim them as blood relatives and poke their nose just to spite the Fallen Angels or any of the Three Factions.</p><p><br></p><p>The Shinto is sitting on the edge due to the rising power of the Youkai and would probably let them do whatever they want just to curb their power.</p><p><br></p><p>He needed an insider there.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe it was about time to start the Slash Dog Initiative.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Zekram Bael -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Are we just going to let them do what they want, Ancestor?”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the man… no, he wasn’t a man yet. Not if he cried at every second thing others did.</p><p><br></p><p>To be honest, this one of his descendants was a disappointment.</p><p><br></p><p>If he didn’t have the backing of the Bael House, he would have been crushed long ago.</p><p><br></p><p>Runeas’ descendants were much better in this regard.</p><p><br></p><p>And that was also the reason for the current mess.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs had suddenly decided to act as a Lucifer.</p><p><br></p><p>Bringing the extinct houses back and giving them positions in the council.</p><p><br></p><p>Normally that would have been a good thing.</p><p><br></p><p>For a Lucifer, this was obviously a good thing but he seemed to have forgotten a simple thing.</p><p><br></p><p>The Underworld didn’t need a Lucifer anymore.</p><p><br></p><p>One Great King was enough for the Devil Race and the others could only be figure heads.</p><p><br></p><p>Several houses were removed by him over the centuries so that the council was in his grasp.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the Ultimate Class Rating Devils who got the chance to vote in the council were controlled heavily by him through the Rating Games to prevent the loss of power over the major decisions of the Underworld.</p><p><br></p><p>He might not have the raw power of the monsters like Rizevim, Sirzechs or Ajuka but there was still a reason why he was controlling the Underworld over so many centuries.</p><p><br></p><p>Both the current Satans and the Old Satan Faction have been played by him for so many centuries to keep each other in check.</p><p><br></p><p>Venalana’s marriage to the Gremory was to make sure that his blood flowed through Runeas’ descendants as well to get a hand on her side if she decided to return someday. It had also given results beyond his expectations.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs may be a Gremory but he was known for his Power of Destruction, the power of the Bael… his, Zekram Bael’s power.</p><p><br></p><p>Rizevim not being interested helped.</p><p><br></p><p>Not that he didn’t have a plan to keep him at bay. After all, Lilith, the only one with enough power and sway to oppose him very conveniently fell into a comatose state, a prototype of the Sleeping Illness.</p><p><br></p><p>All he would need to do is reveal that Rizevim was keeping the mother of the Devils as a hostage and he would never be able to get control of the Devil race.</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, knowing that mad dog, he would rather burn the world than try to control it, but keeping some failsafes helped.</p><p><br></p><p>He had heard of a new Lucifer a few years ago.</p><p><br></p><p>Young and impressionable and a genius at that. Rizevim was keeping him under strict watch and hadn’t allowed any of his spies to even see the boy or his granddaughter’s face.</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t push either.</p><p><br></p><p>He was quite privy with Rizevim’s obsession with the Lucifer bloodline and if not forced, he wouldn’t try to push that madman’s buttons either.</p><p><br></p><p>Everything he knew about this new Lucifer was from hearsay and from what he had heard, the boy was… sane.</p><p><br></p><p>A sane Lucifer was… as surprising as it was dangerous.</p><p><br></p><p>The biggest reason that he could keep Lucifer House in line was because each one of them were somewhat insane and all he needed to do was know how they ticked and use it to his advantage.</p><p><br></p><p>Even he, with more or less the entire underworld under his control, didn’t underestimate the power the name carried. One of the reasons why one of <em>his</em> descendants was the current Lucifer.</p><p><br></p><p>But now, that same descendant was causing problems.</p><p><br></p><p>Sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe, the Old Satan faction needs a hand with some of their new projects and help to knock the foolish ideas out of Sirzechs’ head.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Michael -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the reports in front of him and felt disgust well up from within.</p><p><br></p><p>The decision to conduct investigations on the Church had been a correct one. They had found over half a dozen illegal, unsanctioned facilities and several times that number of sanctioned ones which did experiments which would have led to Father ordering entire cities to be erased completely.</p><p><br></p><p>Was this what was going on in the church nowadays?</p><p><br></p><p>Children… being tortured… killed in Father’s name… for what?</p><p><br></p><p>To protect the system, he had forgotten the main objective of the system which was to protect and guide humanity first.</p><p><br></p><p>Putting the cart before the horse.</p><p><br></p><p>Was this why that brother of his had avoided Heaven?</p><p><br></p><p>He looked back at the core of the System in the Seventh Heaven.</p><p><br></p><p>This place…</p><p><br></p><p>It brought out several good and bad memories for Michael.</p><p><br></p><p>This was the start of Heaven. The place where he was born. The place where he was raised. The place where he had learned everything and spent the brightest of his days with his parents and siblings. And the place which was probably the cause of his brother’s rebellion.</p><p><br></p><p>His oath had kept him from bringing those words to his mouth but at times like these, he wondered back to his mother’s words.</p><p><br></p><p>Michael is a general and Helel is a King.</p><p><br></p><p>As twisted as it might be, those words were proved true.</p><p><br></p><p>Helel… no, Lucifer, did make his own empire, one which rivalled and even surpassed Heaven today while he… couldn’t maintain the one left by his father.</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes he wondered if it had been the other way round, if he was the one to fall, would Heaven be in a better position?</p><p><br></p><p>Was he even worthy of the respect and dedication of his brothers and sisters, of this… this throne his father sat on when he couldn’t even maintain the basic principle his father had preached.</p><p><br></p><p>Quickly shaking his head, he brought his thoughts back to the current matter.</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>It was not the time to think about such things.</p><p><br></p><p>The Church needed to be controlled.</p><p><br></p><p>But for that he needed to solve the core reason for their acts.</p><p><br></p><p>Strength.</p><p><br></p><p>Since the passing away of Father, both heaven and church have been decaying in terms of strength.</p><p><br></p><p>If Heaven was stronger, the church wouldn’t be so dead set on chasing after strength.</p><p><br></p><p>Replenishing numbers was not an option for Heaven but increasing the quality of each member was within his reach.</p><p><br></p><p>If one of their brothers had reached the height previously impossible for Angels to reach, then there might be a chance that others could do the same. A very small chance but a chance nonetheless.</p><p><br></p><p>With that in mind, he called for a meeting of all the Seraphs and Great Seraphs.</p><p><br></p><p>“I think all of you have already seen the reports from the Church given by the sudden investigation by Heaven.”</p><p><br></p><p>Murmurs ran through the hall.</p><p><br></p><p>Some were enraged while some worried about the fate of the ones involved.</p><p><br></p><p>“In part, some of the fault lies on us as well. We were given the task to guide humanity but we failed to do so. Today, the church, the biggest followers of Heaven, are chasing after strength, a part of this has to do with the declining strength of Heaven. I know this doesn’t excuse their behaviour and the ones involved will be sanctioned but if we want to prevent such a thing from happening in the future, we have to solve the main root cause. I know that we cannot increase our numbers as before but… we can work harder and increase our individual strength. Taking this thought, I have come up with a plan of action. Raphael, if you will.” He passed the outline of the plan to his brother for review.</p><p><br></p><p>“Three Great Seraphs, namely, Uriel, Gabriel and me will select a hundred High Class Angels and train them to the next level. Each of the Seraphs will select one hundred low Class Angels and train them to High Class levels in the next five years.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Brother, the other two factions will take this as a sign of war.” Uriel said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Actually, they won’t be able to do anything. The Devils are under heavy civil tensions currently and my spies in the Fallen Angels have told me that there is some unrest among the fallen as well. We had to step back in the altercation with the Norse recently. If we don’t take a solid step, soon other factions will start to step in our territories. Other factions are on the side due to the appearance and show of power of our mysterious sibling. There are rumours that we decided to bring out our trump card to prevent other factions from encroaching. Let’s take advantage of their misunderstanding and raise our combat levels to defend ourselves.” Raphael answered, earning the agreement of others.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then it’s decided. In the meanwhile, one of the seraphs should be assigned to the Vatican every month alternately to keep an eye on the reformation process. Take in the Sacred Gear users and the people who were experimented on in the church facilities and see to their training and development personally. They have endured a lot due to our negligence and they deserve care.” Michael commanded his fellow siblings.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes brother.”</p><p><br></p><p>The meeting continued and they discussed the finer points of the plan.</p><p><br></p><p>If Michael was a general, then he would strive to be the best general he can be and protect the legacy of his parents… in his own way.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Damien -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I sat before my subordinates.</p><p><br></p><p>It had been six months since we recruited Valerie and our treaty with Azazel and Odin.</p><p><br></p><p>These six months had been quiet but for everyone of us, this was the quiet before the storm.</p><p><br></p><p>In this time, I had given a chakra fruit to Shirone too as well as collected one for Akira’s sister. Kuroka had completed her training and started training Shirone and Akira. She was now a full fledged nine tailed Nekoshou, the first of her kind.</p><p><br></p><p>Akira had gained his ninth tail as well.</p><p><br></p><p>This happened at the right time too because tensions were rising among the Onmyoji and the Youkai.</p><p><br></p><p>The Five Principal Clans and the Onmyoji were recovering from the shock of the Kyoto battle and were slowly testing Yasaka with small nudges. It was basically by them not doing anything when the Utsusemi Agency was attacking Youkai.</p><p><br></p><p>The complaints were ignored.</p><p><br></p><p>Under my influence, the Himejima Clan didn’t involve themselves in this mess. Suzaku was marked by my Binder’s mark and had started training with her powers.</p><p><br></p><p>She had grown a lot during this time. The hardships she faced made her stronger than she was supposed to be. The Mark just added a cherry on top. To be honest, I hadn’t thought that she would be able to reach this level of power so soon but currently, she is rivalling the Oryuu’s inheritor, Oryuu Nakiri, the strongest of the five Sacred Beast users of this generation. She was a solid Ultimate Class even without the Vermilion Bird.</p><p><br></p><p>My own team had reached a level which would deter almost any faction.</p><p><br></p><p>In these last six months, we had drowned ourselves in the last stretch of training before we revealed ourselves.</p><p><br></p><p>This included our newest member, Valerie Tepes.</p><p><br></p><p>She had been scared for a while but I took her to meet Gasper, who was undergoing therapy under Ophelia, similar to Akane. The two dhampirs were happy to reunite with each other and had adjusted in their respective environments better.</p><p><br></p><p>She had taken well to Asia, Vienna, Shirone and Akeno.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl was a bit of a prankster and once she got comfortable, she started messing around with everyone.</p><p><br></p><p>Her training was overseen by Hagoromo Gitsune.</p><p><br></p><p>As far as training went, Merlin had gone to visit his former student’s clan and snagged himself two students.</p><p><br></p><p>Arthur Pendragon and Ley Fay Pendragon were quite talented, although the latter was just a kid around Shirone’s age right now.</p><p><br></p><p>The current leader of the house was a massive DICKtator but Merlin was pretty experienced in being a dick himself so that problem was taken care of quite easily.</p><p><br></p><p>This did bring some friction between the Pendragon family and the church as they wanted to invite the kids to train but were rejected.</p><p><br></p><p>From what I found out from my sources, both Heaven and the Devils have started making strong moves to get their shit together.</p><p><br></p><p>Michael seems to have grown or rather regrown a backbone again.</p><p><br></p><p>The Church now had a Seraph stationed at all times.</p><p><br></p><p>The Angels were training too.</p><p><br></p><p>Good.</p><p><br></p><p>I continued having the dreams of Lucifer’s or rather Helel’s memories and from what I had seen, Michael was without a doubt a better general than him. He was a warrior through and through and this was exactly how the old Michael, the one called the Right Hand of God, would act.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy was finally recovering from the passing of his Father and the rest of the Angels finally had their commander back as well as their confidence. I don’t know why but had an urge to smile every time I thought of this.</p><p><br></p><p>Several of the people, including the children from the Holy Sword Project were organised into special groups trained under the supervision of the Top Exorcists like Vasco Strada and Griselda Quarta.</p><p><br></p><p>As for the Devils, Sirzechs took the warning to heart and had somehow grown a pair too. Eighteen extinct houses were reestablished in these last six months despite the initial opposition of the council.</p><p><br></p><p>The old devils had gone suspiciously quiet after their initial opposition.</p><p><br></p><p>They were probably scheming something and everyone knew this. The new Satans just didn’t care and wanted to get as much of the changes done before they could do anything.</p><p><br></p><p>I for one welcomed the changes they were bringing.</p><p><br></p><p>Among the eighteen houses which were given seats in the council again… eighteen, yes, all eighteen were <em>my</em> subordinates. These were the people Ophelia had employed or made contracts with earlier on my order. And just like that, I had almost half of the seats in the council under my control. Thanks to Sirzechs.</p><p><br></p><p>Last but not the least, the Fallen Angels were having a minor civil strife.</p><p><br></p><p>Sataneel had rebelled with his Abyss Class.</p><p><br></p><p>It was slightly different from what I remembered but then again, I had changed the world beyond recognition so it wasn’t strange either.</p><p><br></p><p>The Wizards of Oz were in collaboration with the Utsusemi Agency and Sataneel who had made a new group called the Chaos Brigade.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>The original creator of the Chaos Brigade was Sataneel.</p><p><br></p><p>At least, this one had the correct spelling.</p><p><br></p><p>He was contracted by the Old Satan faction, to be precise, Rizevim himself who gave him a chance to study the Malebranche.. Only the top people knew of this.</p><p><br></p><p>Euclid was one of them.</p><p><br></p><p>As enraging as it might have been to let that bastard go back then, the advantages he brought to us as a spy is beyond question.</p><p><br></p><p>I even got a chance to sneak in and bring back Gretel’s mother’s body as well as… mark Lilith with a Binder’s Mark to bring her back to me whenever I wanted.</p><p><br></p><p>This brings me to Gretel.</p><p><br></p><p>She had… been in a very complicated mood since the encounter in Romania.</p><p><br></p><p>The fact that she believed even for a moment that she was tricked and her mother was still alive, forced her to see things from Grayfia’s point of view.</p><p><br></p><p>She just couldn’t blame her suffering on her anymore. To be honest, it was misguided from the start but I let it be because it was one of her driving forces back then. Now though, she was ready to see things from a broader perspective and I welcomed it.</p><p><br></p><p>Their last talk didn’t go that well, with Gretel being out of it for the most part.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t organise any meetings between them but I am planning to bring her with me when Vienna has a spar with her eternal rival.</p><p><br></p><p>It would be better for her to clear that part of her life as well.</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing her mother’s body again, helped her come to terms with her past to a great deal.</p><p><br></p><p>That bastard, Euclid had kept the body preserved, maybe to do further experiments or create clones, I had no idea and I was honestly not interested to pursue that train of thought either.</p><p><br></p><p>“So Boss, how are we going to reveal ourselves to the world? Attack someone? Start a war? Challenge a God maybe?” Sean asked, hyped up about the coming days.</p><p><br></p><p>He had completed his training under Brynhildr and had attained Balance Breaker of the True Longinus, enabling him to fight on par with Lavinia and Ingvild and hold his own against Merlin and even Gretel.</p><p><br></p><p>The training with Brynhildr had really paid off.</p><p><br></p><p>He had returned with Rossweisse in tow and I used my last Binder’s Mark on her and I wasn’t disappointed either.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl, even by Merlin’s insane standards, was a genius.</p><p><br></p><p>The nerfed Archmage Essence enabled her to learn the spirit magic of her family which she hadn’t previously inherited and the girl had cried over it.</p><p><br></p><p>Her serious attitude made her an instant hit with Gretel. To be honest, they looked like twins with different coloured eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>She went back to her grandmother to learn her family magic and I allowed her, even encouraged her to do so.</p><p><br></p><p>Coming back to the current scene, I smiled at Sean’s enthusiasm. “We are going to do something even better.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! Better than fighting a God? What’s that?”</p><p><br></p><p>My smile grew wider suddenly. “Open a bar.”</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support Me on: </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crossedge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.patreon.com/crossedge</a></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: @LuluViBritania (FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Authors Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I started this chapter right after I completed the last one but got stuck in a writer’s block mid chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>So if anyone notices a change in writing style, I am sorry about that.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I tried to make this chapter into an interlude of sorts.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>From the next chapter, the main game starts as every side will be out in the open.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I will make and upload a character sheet in a day or two maybe.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The next chapter will be another snippet.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br><br><br><br></p>",

My Observation Haki took in their emotions and told me about the state of all their minds.</p><p><br></p><p>Euclid was… stunned, hateful but more than anything else… afraid. The gauntlet of his was similar to a Sacred Gear but at the same time not. It was full of negative emotions but also contained a life of some sort, although the entire thing was of a demonic nature. It was unlike anything I had heard or read about.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs was shocked as well but was hiding it well behind his stoic mask. Grayfia was the same but was nowhere near as composed. Euclid and maybe even Gretel’s presence was a major reason for it maybe.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias was scared and excited.</p><p><br></p><p>The one with the weirdest reaction was probably Rizevim.</p><p><br></p><p>That guy was… happy. No, he was beyond happy and it was kinda unsettling.</p><p><br></p><p>The eyepatch on his face was a reminder of Razevan’s suicidal attack and the memory of receiving that news made me recall several other things as well.</p><p><br></p><p>I slowly calmed myself and reigned in my Haki. Losing control of my emotions against this guy would be the biggest mistake. Finally in control, I turned towards Gretel. “Are you both alright?”</p><p><br></p><p>They nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahahaha I knew it. I absolutely knew it. How can someone like you die? And to the likes of those. Impossible. You really pulled the wool over everyone’s eyes. Did you hate your big brother so much?” Rizevim laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Look, Sirzechs. Aren't you so proud of your little sister? This is <em>my</em> little brother. Well, half-brother but you know, it's the same. Let me introduce him. This is Damien Lucifer… Asmodeus. The satanic miracle child if you will.\"</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at him, narrowing my eyes very slightly before I calmed myself.</p><p><br></p><p>Showing any kind of weakness in front of him would be a mistake.</p><p><br></p><p>The bastard revealed my Asmodeus lineage which I was trying to keep out so as to not spook out people too much.</p><p><br></p><p>And as expected, when I looked at Sirzechs, he looked shocked and his eyes stayed on me a second more than normal. Sigh. So much for keeping a mysterious air for longer.</p><p><br></p><p>The bastard however wasn't done yet.</p><p><br></p><p>\"So, how is my cute granddaughter, Vienna? I thought her father was a waste but even he gave me a good surprise. I wonder if she will do the same?\"</p><p><br></p><p>I took a very light breath and pushed my anger away with my occlumency.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Really? You almost seem like you care about family. You sent people to frame me, you arranged my own teacher to assassinate Vienna, you made your son's life a living hell and then killed him, not to mention the fact that you killed your own father.”</p><p><br></p><p>Several heads turned my way except Rizevim who was completely unphased, “And you seem like you care for our family. If that’s your care, I’d rather you left us alone.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>The silence which settled over the place was deafening.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone except Rizevim and I were tensed by the reveal.</p><p><br></p><p>The reveal wouldn't do anything because even if Sirzechs himself went out and declared it… no one will believe him. In fact, there will be a high chance for people to speak against him for making such claims.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean, claiming that the actual son of Lucifer killed Lucifer when he had led a rebellion against the Old Satan descendants would only serve to paint him in a bad light.</p><p><br></p><p>The man in question however was not bothered at all. Instead a feral glint appeared in his eyes as his smile widened. “I am hurt you know… that you think so about me. I care for my family. In fact, I care for our family the most. You see Damien, there is not a single person in the world whom I respected more than dear ol’ Dad.”</p><p><br></p><p>He spread his arms while explaining and astonishingly, I didn’t sense a single bit of lie in the statement.</p><p><br></p><p>“He was the very definition of Evil. I have been fascinated with him since the moment I was born. He was my idol. The perfect devil if you will. My only goal in life was to surpass him.”</p><p><br></p><p>I got a bad feeling in my heart. This guy… Didn’t lie. Not a single word was a lie.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact I was not the only one.</p><p><br></p><p>I could sense the disturbed feelings from everyone.</p><p><br></p><p>The man in question however carried on as if he didn’t notice anything.</p><p><br></p><p>“But I realised that there was nothing I could do. No matter what I did, I would just be ‘A Devil’ while he would always be ‘The Devil’.”</p><p><br></p><p>I saw several people look in my direction.</p><p><br></p><p>“But I lost that respect, you know… when he decided to end the war. What kind of Devil would end a war that caused such terrifying chaos all over the world. And for what? Because some people died? Because his fellow Satans died? Because <em>his father</em> died? That was not the man I respected. So I only had one choice. I killed him. To keep the Devil, the real Devil’s memories alive in my heart, I killed him. I did it for him, you know? I didn’t want anyone to see that weak and pathetic Devil who would choose peace over war.”</p><p><br></p><p>His expression at the end was of pure loathing and disgust. “But he did show me that he was the Devil at the end. He, our Father, made a prophecy that I would die by the hands of a Lucifer someday.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And that’s why you kept every Lucifer in chains. So that you can escape the words of a dying man and continue living?” I asked emotionlessly.</p><p><br></p><p>“No no. On the contrary, I was bored out of my mind. After the four Satans died, two by my own hands, it was as if the Underworld had lost all real devils. The new ones were idiots who preferred to wave around the name of their parents but couldn’t do anything of their own. While people like these,” He pointed towards Sirzechs, “And his bestie did spark my interest, it was just not that. They were devils, strong ones no doubt, but they were just that… simple devils, not… The Devil. I was all alone. They didn’t have that, <em>that</em> instinct. So in the end, I just had to go back to the Prophecy made by Dad.” He stared directly at me. </p><p><br></p><p>“You see Damien, I didn’t mark Razevan with the Death Trigger because I was afraid of being killed by him… I marked him because I was afraid he would give up on trying to kill me….and run away.”</p><p><br></p><p>I continuously forced out all kinds of negative thoughts out of my mind to not let my emotions show.</p><p><br></p><p>This bastard… this fucking insane bastard.</p><p><br></p><p>“Razevan found out about me sending off Dear Old Dad on the next journey from Gloria Lucifuge, the mother of the three present here… but, who do you think told <em>her</em> about it?”</p><p><br></p><p>Despite my preparations, my eyes widened slightly when I realised what he had said.</p><p><br></p><p>“<em>Gretel, hold back.</em>” I shouted in my head the moment I got back my senses.</p><p><br></p><p>“I wanted to inspire him, to provoke him to become a good devil but that son of mine was a waste. Even when his first two wives had <em>accidents</em>, he didn’t fight back. The first time he did was when my people found out about my cute granddaughter. He killed them all….and I rewarded him. I let his human wife stay and give birth. After all, half it might be, she still had Lucifer blood. So she was also qualified.”</p><p><br></p><p>I bit my tongue to show no expressions and he continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“But then something happened. Do you know what, Damien?” He looked crazily at me. “What else, you were born. A two year old child knocked over a thousand devils unconscious. That power, that potential, I knew it at that very instant that I got my new playmate. You see Damien, I care for my family. I care for them the most. Sure, I poke them, taunt them, torture them, but it was to make them into proper Devils. I also rewarded them when they did. What, you don’t believe me? Ah, you hurt your big brother’s feelings. Well let me prove it to you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You overcame the trap set for you to sully your image and I made little Gretel your aide. Razevan overcame his fear and attacked me, even gave me a wound and I proudly keep this wound on me. I could have easily healed the wound like Euclid did, but this” He touched the eyepatch on his face, ''is proof that my son was not a waste.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I also rewarded him by….not following or searching for you.”</p><p><br></p><p>I am pretty sure I skipped a heartbeat.</p><p><br></p><p>“What! Surprised? You see, after Razevan passed away, I checked all his activities and found several interesting things. He had removed my cute granddaughter from the Lucifer House and made Gretel the Head of the Lucifuge House. I even passed it and now little Gretel is Lady Lucifuge. Now….why would he do so right before attacking me? If he could remove the Death Mark from himself, couldn’t he do the same for my cute granddaughter and you. It gave me hope or else Big Brother was so sad after losing all his playmates….”</p><p><br></p><p>“And you were not afraid that I would run away with Vienna and never show up?” I asked, narrowing my eyes slightly. Razevan’s actions and removing his Death Mark might have aroused suspicion. I had hoped for it to be ignored as they made no move to search for us.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh no. No no no no no. I was never afraid about that. You are not the type to run away. You Damien, are born different. When I was disappointed by my son, I started a project, a big project to make the evilest Devil I could. It was called Project Genesis. To combine the genes of two Satans and create a Devil who could entertain me and after two hundred years and several hundreds of failures, there was a success. I was ecstatic. So ecstatic that I even ignored my son for a while and that led him to elope and get a human wife. And you didn’t disappoint me either. Ultimate Class at eight, Satan Class at 11 and now, a Super Devil at 14. Even Dad was not <em>this</em> crazy. Big Brother will have to work harder to not get left behind.”</p><p><br></p><p>I noticed that Sirzechs and his group were now staring at me as if I was a ghost. Too bad their information was not up to date. I was already 19 and Gretel was 25 due to the time dilation in Innovate Clear. The only reason I kept this appearance was to not give anyone any clue about our means. </p><p><br></p><p>“But it was not your power either. You see Damien, Dad was not dangerous because of the power he possessed. I mean, even I, myself possessed several times more power than him and Gramps, he was <em>far</em> stronger. No, it was the way he thought, his mind, his talent, his <em>whole being!</em> And you remind me of him in not just your looks but your entire being. It was as if he himself came back from the dead and stood in front of me but somehow, became even better than he was before. Lucifer 2.0 if you will hahahaha.”</p><p><br></p><p>I felt a slight chill in my spine at his words.</p><p><br></p><p>“I know you are not the type to run away because it’s not in your very nature. Euclid tried to pull a prank and discredit you in front of others and almost instantly you turned the entire crowd against him… without speaking a word. If I hadn’t interfered, he would have been declared a traitor.</p><p><br></p><p>“Katerea tried to control you and within a month she was so scared of you that she wouldn’t even look you directly in the eye. And that was when you were nine.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The human you called mother died and within a year over ten thousand devils passed away all the while you were being monitored 24/7.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I planned to test my granddaughter in a harmless assassination attempt and you erased one of our biggest bases along with two thousand devils and even your first teacher. You Damien, killed more devils while not even leaving a room and being continuously monitored than he,” He pointed at Sirzechs, “and his bestie did during the entire Civil War even when in the open… and don’t even dare say that it was Razevan. No, he had neither the guts nor ability. It couldn’t be him. <em>I know</em>.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Just like you knew how strong he was or what connections he had made until it was all over?” I mocked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Touche. But no. If he had such an influence, he would have ganged up on me and had me ambushed and killed long before now. He didn’t. So it was not him.”</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t reply to it.</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t give up on grudges and so you will not run.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I have no interest in your games, Rizevim.”</p><p><br></p><p>His smile widened as he burst out laughing in front of everyone.</p><p><br></p><p>“But you want to kill me, right? Right? Then you are already playing my game. No take backsies.”</p><p><br></p><p>The atmosphere became even tenser if it was somehow even possible.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Sirzechs -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He felt the hair on the back of his neck rise up from the revelations. He had already known, both from the repeated warnings of his elders and his own experience that he must not provoke Rizevim Livan Lucifer and he had paid attention to it too. His entire peerage was made up of non Sacred Gear users for the sole purpose of countering Rizevim.</p><p><br></p><p>But even in his wildest dream he didn’t think that Rizevim would be this… insane.</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t have the slightest word for it.</p><p><br></p><p>And then he looked on the other side. That haunting image of Lucifer.</p><p><br></p><p>Damien Lucifer Asmodeus.</p><p><br></p><p>That name alone would cause rebellions if people heard about him and that’s not even counting the face which accompanied the name.</p><p><br></p><p>That fleeting hope that Henriech was tricked was all flushed away as soon as the boy… no, he was not a boy, this man entered the scene.</p><p><br></p><p>The same power which had knocked out the Youkai in Kyoto, also knocked out the Vampires today.</p><p><br></p><p>It was beyond a shadow of doubt that he was the same person.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl behind him was more like a hammer to his face than anything. Even now, he could feel the shivering fingers of Grayfia as she looked at both Euclid and… Gretel.</p><p><br></p><p>When he came out today, it was to get a short break from his hectic schedule and spend some time with his family.</p><p><br></p><p>To think this is what he would encounter… First Euclid being alive, then Grayfia's younger sister and then the news that Grayfia's mother was alive.</p><p><br></p><p>He couldn't even imagine the state of mind she was in right now.</p><p><br></p><p>Back then Grayfia and he had liked each other and were actually trying to get each other to their own sides. Grayfia had no intention of betraying the Old Satan faction but more importantly her own family.</p><p><br></p><p>It was the death of her mother, or now that he found out, the news of her death at her hands of none other than her own little brother that had convinced her to ditch the Old Satan faction which had turned her little brother into that.</p><p><br></p><p>When they had gotten the news that Euclid had died, she had been hit the hardest.  She still believed that Euclid was influenced by them. It had still grated her to no end that she had failed her mother and brother. It was one of the reasons that despite being his wife, she acted like a maid as some sort of twisted repentance. Even he had stopped trying to convince her about it after knowing her reason.</p><p><br></p><p>And now this news, coming and blowing everything she knew, out of the world.</p><p><br></p><p>She was suddenly hit with the fact that she had not only failed her mother but also three other brothers whose names and faces she didn't even know and now another sister who seemed to hate her too.</p><p><br></p><p>Damien looked stoically at the crazy person that was Rizevim.</p><p><br></p><p>And the man in question looked like he was having the time of his life. After finishing with Damien, he looked at Gretel.</p><p><br></p><p>“And look at you Gretel, all grown up. You look so pretty and have become strong too. The strongest Lucifuge and that too at sixteen. Gloria would be so proud.”</p><p><br></p><p>He was not wrong. The power that she just exhibited would easily put her far above the likes of Grayfia and Serafall… maybe even together.</p><p><br></p><p>Even he would need to get serious to fight her. And she was just sixteen. Not even mid twenties when the natural growth of a Devil is the strongest. This meant that she would just get stronger in the future. A lot stronger. Perhaps even…</p><p><br></p><p>She was beyond loyal to Damien from what little he had seen.</p><p><br></p><p>Which left the biggest unknown of all.</p><p><br></p><p>A 14 year old Super Devil. How the fuck do you even get that strong?</p><p><br></p><p>Even he and Ajuka needed to get to their fifties to come close to that level.</p><p><br></p><p>And he was 14? He looked more like sixteen or even eighteen.</p><p><br></p><p>This makes two beyond Satan Class beings in the younger Lucifer’s team.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl with the Absolute Demise could also fight at the same level. So three. There was that Youkai girl. Four.</p><p><br></p><p>Four known members and all could fight at the level of a Satan or beyond. And who knows how many others he had supporting him?</p><p><br></p><p>If this was matched with whatever he had just heard from Rizevim, then this new Lucifer was far more dangerous than Rizevim.</p><p><br></p><p>And the worst part was that he didn’t know anything about him either. His motivations, his powers, nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>He watched as Rizevim continued. “You know what would be awesome. Yes yes I know.” he turned towards Euclid. “You know, you could always try to make another little sister from your mother.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs froze and so did Grayfia.</p><p><br></p><p>“Surprise. Did I surprise you, Gretel? You see, Euclid was worried that you were becoming a mama’s girl so he lied. The body you saw of your mother… was a fake.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Gretel stop.” Damien shouted instantly as Rizevim’s power burst. Barriers far stronger than the ones before were casted and even the twisting space around him was shattered. The shockwaves from the attack rushed out and Sirzechs stood in front of Rias and Grayfia, his power of destruction flaring and creating a dome around them, erasing the shockwave.</p><p><br></p><p>On the other side, Damien stood in front of the girls and blue flames emerged from his body creating a ring around them and burning the shockwaves.</p><p><br></p><p>The Blue Flames of Asmodeus.</p><p><br></p><p>He inherited the Clan Trait.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs had only heard tales of the fabled blue flames which could burn everything but now, seeing it up close, it was even more than he had expected.</p><p><br></p><p>He took a look at Gretel’s face and the sheer look of pain and rage was only controlled by the fact that Damien was standing in front of her and she didn’t want to hurt him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Uyahahahaha youngsters nowadays. So excitable. Anyways, enjoy the fun, Damien. We will meet again soon. Anything you want to add, Euclid?”</p><p><br></p><p>Euclid walked from behind Rizevim as the man himself backed away… to watch the show. He glared at Damien and then at Gretel. “You both had the chance. You could have been the leaders of the devil race and taken back its glory but you chose to be traitors. Especially you.” He looked at Damien. “You are a shame to the blood in your veins. And for what? All for that filthy human woman. Trash like her…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Euclid.” Damien spoke. For the first time, Sirzechs saw a hint of rage in those piercing blue eyes. His voice was perfectly calm but hundreds of years of instincts honed in wars screamed at Sirzechs to be alert. And then he continued. “...your voice is annoying.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t see it.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs didn’t even feel Damien moving and the next moment Euclid was under his boots and the entire area, hundreds of metres around them caved in.</p><p><br></p><p>He quickly eyed Rizevim and saw the look of surprise. Even he didn’t realise it.</p><p><br></p><p>What kind of speed was this?</p><p><br></p><p>There were no indications, no demonic power or energy surges, nothing. One minute he was there, the other, he had crossed the distance and kicked Euclid into the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>The only reason anyone even knew that he didn’t teleport was the trail left on the snow.</p><p><br></p><p>Miasma collected around Euclid and his wounds started healing quickly as he started to struggle to get up but to no avail. His demonic energy flared but to no avail.</p><p><br></p><p>He waved his hand and clawed towards Damien but all that resulted in was the sound of metal striking another metal as the claw was grabbed in Damien’s hands who effortlessly ripped it apart.</p><p><br></p><p>“ARGHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!” Euclid cried out in pain.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. A consciousness inside it. Very similar to a Sacred Gear but of Demonic Nature. Made of Agarasite, the same ones used to make the Evil Pieces. Strong enough to rival a Low Tier Longinus. But… not strong enough.” Damien tossed the claw gauntlet aside but this time it didn’t return like before to attach itself to Euclid.</p><p><br></p><p>Damien continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“Now, tell me. Who gave you the guts to raise your voice against me? Was it that toy of yours? As you can already see, it was useless. Or was it him?” He pointed towards Rizevim. “Because as far as I know him, he would clap his hands in glee and even praise me if I were to just rip your head off your neck. Or could it be that you are relying on your Big Sis? Despite all your hate words, you still want her sympathy? <em>How pathetic</em>.”</p><p><br></p><p>The shouts continued and the demonic power increased.</p><p><br></p><p>“Be quiet.” Damien flexed his leg and all the demonic power from Euclid disappeared.</p><p><br></p><p>No matter how much Euclid struggled after that or tried, no demonic power was released.</p><p><br></p><p>Damien crouched and removed his foot from Euclid’s face but grabbed his hair instead, raising him by it.</p><p><br></p><p>“Now then, where was I? Yes. Why are you so proud, Euclid? Just because you kept your mother a prisoner and experimented on her? Is that an achievement for you? Your mother is alive, right?” Euclid glared but didn’t answer.</p><p><br></p><p>BOOOOOOOOOM!</p><p><br></p><p>Euclid’s face was bashed into the ground almost instantly and again raised by his hair.</p><p><br></p><p>“When I ask a question, it means I expect to be answered. Do you know why I don’t just end your suffering, Euclid? I mean I could have killed you anytime since I was nine. Even in a one on one fight. And yet, you are here. Tell me, do you know why?”</p><p><br></p><p>He raised Euclid to his eye level, staring directly into his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s because you are already dead. You just haven’t realised it yet.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs felt a deep chill at the statement.</p><p><br></p><p>“You died the moment you laid a finger on <em>my</em> Gretel.”</p><p><br></p><p>A cold wind blew silently. It was as if the cold Romanian forest somehow miraculously got even colder.</p><p><br></p><p>“Everything you did after that, plotting against me, trying to brainwash Gretel. Oh! You thought I wouldn’t notice such blatant use of mind magic? Do I need to remind you that I surpassed my teachers in all their fields of magic? So, where was I, ah yes, trying to assassinate my sister, everything… all you did, just made the time before you realise it… more painful.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The only reason I let you be until now was because I promised Gretel that she will get to decide what to do with you. And that is what will happen. You will live… and you will realise death… by her will. If somehow by an off chance, something else happens, I will drag your filthy, corrupted soul from whatever corner it is hiding and throw it at her feet so that she can decide what to do with you. If… in doing so, your mind breaks into tiny pieces or your spirit crumbles or even your soul remains an empty husk… that’s not my problem. And when all this is over and your soul, if it somehow, miraculously survives and makes it to hell… I will be there… to continue our game even longer. Do you know why?” He brought his face an inch from Euclid’s and continued. “<em>Because I am The Devil.</em>”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you get it Euclid? So today, when you go back to your mother, tell her this. I am sure that the woman will be happy.”</p><p><br></p><p>He dropped Euclid’s body and got up before walking towards the two girls, only to pause for a moment and turn back.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! And never again insult my mother. I promised Gretel not to kill you. I never said anything about not tearing you limb from limb and feeding them to you till you break. And yes… this is a threat.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Uyahahahaha wonderful wonderful. In that case, the game is on. I will be honest, big brother is a little jelly of Euclid getting all the attention. But no problem. I am looking forward to the game. Congratulations on your new toy. Buh-bye.”</p><p><br></p><p>A magic circle lit up around Rizevim, Euclid and the gauntlet, thrown on the ground and a moment later, they were all teleported away.</p><p><br></p><p>A few moments passed but no words were spoken.</p><p><br></p><p>Damien took a deep breath and suddenly broke the silence. “Your mother’s body was not fake. She did die the day you saw her. Rizevim was baiting us.”</p><p><br></p><p>What!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Damien -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I looked towards the dumbfounded Sirzechs and then at Grayfia.</p><p><br></p><p>I knew it from the moment Rizevim had lied but I didn’t want to tell them about my power. So, I explained. “Just now, when I attacked Euclid, I forcibly removed that artifact from him. It was loosely attached to his soul which caused him to be disoriented. I took advantage of his flaring Demonic Power to use a spell on him and attacked his head to cause him to lose control of his consciousness. This made it easy to dive into his head and find out information about Gretel’s mother. The question about his mother was to direct his attention to the subject and make it easier to find the information. She died. I was trying to find the location of her body but couldn’t do so in a short time and just marked him.”</p><p><br></p><p>I turned towards Gretel and completed, “I marked him. He will not be running away.”</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. I put a Binder’s Mark on him.</p><p><br></p><p>When I said that even if he died, I would resurrect him… I was not lying.</p><p>Binder’s Mark can be controlled in a way that I can control what I do to the target.</p><p> </p><p>I can choose whose will to bend and whom to give power.</p><p>For Euclid, he got his allegiance turned to me but got none of the power.</p><p>A fight with Rizevim would have been stupidity in this situation.</p><p>First, my own faction was just starting. A massive battle such as between two Super Devils and others possibly could have destroyed a major part of Europe and that would have directly given people a reason to brand me as a terrorist.</p><p>Second, there was a chance that Rizevim would run away or Sirzechs would intervene and I couldn’t be sure of the win if such a thing happened.</p><p>What I did know was that the Sirzechs would definitely not let a fight happen as that would put the already shaky Devil faction in the frying pan once more.</p><p>The only thing left was killing Euclid but… why kill him now if I can use him?</p><p>As I explained earlier, he was already dead. He just hasn’t realised it yet, because Binder’s Mark is just that broken. The Euclid who served Rizevim was already dead. Now, he was just my pawn waiting to be used by me.</p><p>I needed an in within Rizevim’s inner circle.</p><p>The two ways to do so would be to send one of my own people or convert one of his, and who better than the one whom we all hate.</p><p>I also needed information on what that gauntlet that Euclid was using now was. All I got from Euclid in the passing was only bits of information. It had the power to rival a Longinus and if they had more or those things, I needed it out of my way quickly.</p><p>I walked up to Gretel who was still shaken and took her in my arms, caressing her head.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will bring back your mother’s body. I promise.”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded her head while still in my chest.</p><p><br></p><p>She moved back a little after a few moments and I caressed Lavinia’s head who was much better.</p><p><br></p><p>I finally turned my attention towards the group that was left</p><p><br></p><p>“I still have an hour and a half. I heard that you wanted to meet me. So let’s talk.”</p><p><br></p><p>The guy looked surprised. “You are going to wait for the vampires?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I said I would wait for two hours. I do not lie.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>It was Rias who broke the silence first.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, you, just now, you were not angry? Were you acting?”</p><p><br></p><p>“About what?”</p><p><br></p><p>“When he… that guy insulted your mother.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Rias!” Sirzechs stopped or rather tried to but I just smiled it off.</p><p><br></p><p>“I witnessed my mother’s cold dead body while my little sister was crying her heart out in my embrace… and although barely, still held back. I was ten back then. I think it would take something more than just mere words to get me riled up and snap.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“I… I’m sorry.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s not your fault. You didn’t know anything.”</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t.</p><p><br></p><p>We never talked about my past even when we talked.</p><p><br></p><p>She was probably the only person with whom I could have a <em>normal</em> conversation with, as a friend and she was too young. We never got so much into details.</p><p><br></p><p>“But you know what, you lied just now.” SHe replied looking smug.</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled. “I didn’t Princess, I assure you that every word I said was true. The emotions behind them were as real as they get. The fact that my other actions got covered behind them was just a….happy coincidence. I prefer the word Misdirection rather than lying for this.”</p><p><br></p><p>I noticed Grayfia was looking at Gretel and wanted to say something but was holding back because of me.</p><p><br></p><p>As for Gretel…</p><p><br></p><p><em>Sigh</em>.</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes, it’s better to rip the bandage off to let the wound heal.</p><p><br></p><p>“Gretel.” I looked at her. “Have a talk. Just don’t force yourself and don’t fight.”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at me wide-eyed and I patted her head.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s better to atleast have a talk and understand each other’s circumstances first than hate each other because of the words and actions of a deplorable trash. I am not telling you to get along if you don’t want to but… your mother took an action to save her life. Don’t you want to know her at least and see what your mother was thinking about? After this, no matter what action you take, I will support you.” I slowly caressed her head and she looked at me for a moment and then at Grayfia with a complicated look before looking at me and nodding again, leaving slowly.</p><p><br></p><p>Then I turned to Lavinia. “Go and see if Valerie is alright.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Will you…”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will be alright. If I want to leave, I can leave easily.”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded and left as well.</p><p><br></p><p>I saw Sirzechs heaving a sigh of relief.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy was extremely tense.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, I turned my attention towards Rias and a smile formed on my face when I thought about the worries of the Gremory family.</p><p><br></p><p>With Sirzechs being present here, I decided to have some fun.</p><p><br></p><p>“We have to stop meeting like this, Princess. I’d prefer a meeting over a cup of tea than like today.”</p><p><br></p><p>She had gotten much better since the first time we met because of our occasional meetings. She didn’t blush much.</p><p><br></p><p>“Were you trying to recruit Gasper as well?” She asked me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, I would be lying if I said I didn’t. He is a good potential recruit. High Magical Power, a strong Sacred Gear which is on the verge of evolving due to a Mutation. I estimate it reaching the level of a Longinus soon.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Really?” She asked, perked up.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs paid attention too but didn’t interfere.</p><p><br></p><p>“Really. But no. My primary target was not Gasper. It was Valerie all along.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh! Why?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm, who knows? Maybe I am just the type of bad guy who goes around kidnapping Princesses.” I smirked and she blushed.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs’ emotions were going up and down like the world’s craziest roller coaster. He decided it was as much as he could take.</p><p><br></p><p>“Damien. Can I call you that?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure can. It’s my name after all.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you really going to wait for the vampires? They might come with an army. The vampires are a very prideful bunch.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Pride is only as good as your strength can support. They will not come. Just pretend that they don’t care for a <em>filthy half-blooded mistake</em>.” I spat out the last part quite annoyed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you really sure?” He asked, genuinely confused.</p><p><br></p><p>I smiled and decided to humour the guy. “I assure you. They will not come. After all… I knocked out everyone within twenty kilometres radius, except us. This includes their King Vald Tepes, the 14th. Even if he regains consciousness this quickly… he wouldn’t dare to come or spread the news. Because that would mean accepting someone knocked them all out….alone. Their tiny pride wouldn’t be able to handle it.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>I let him take a few moments to realise what I had said. This was exactly what I did. I knocked out every vampire in the area. My Observation Haki found no one left awake.</p><p><br></p><p>Then again. It was to be expected. Even the likes of Nue were rendered helpless and that was me holding back.</p><p><br></p><p>The King of the Tepes faction was far from Nue.</p><p><br></p><p>\"What exactly are your plans, Damien?\"</p><p><br></p><p>I chuckled a little at his straight forward question.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Believe it or not but my answer will remain unchanged. I wish to live a peaceful life with my people but my identity makes it nigh impossible. Is it really so hard to believe?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"With everything that has just happened, can you blame me for it?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I am not blaming you. If anything, it's a perfectly reasonable thing to do. But you seem to have a misunderstanding. Razevan wasn't crazy. My cute sister isn't crazy and I'd like to think I am not crazy either… or well, maybe a little. But the fact still stands, Rizevim is an outlier. Don't use him to judge everyone.\"</p><p><br></p><p>A period of silence wafted over the place.</p><p><br></p><p>He took a deep breath and looked me straight in the eye. “Are you really going to fight Rizevim?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Does it look like I have a choice? Things have already gone beyond the point of taking a step back.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We can help you avoid this.\" He said earnestly.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the man closely and asked. \"Why?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"The Devil Race cannot afford a war right now. If such a thing can be prevented, I would do so.\"</p><p><br></p><p>No lies.</p><p><br></p><p>I sighed and looked at him before replying. \"You do know that idealistic people like you always get walked over by others, right? Maybe if you were a little firmer, things would be easier for you four to manage.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"It's politics. We win some, we lose some.\" He answered, completely unphased.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Ah yes, politics. We have that in the underworld nowadays. Really, you people took the Underworld and turned it into hell. So, Mr. Win Some Lose Some, how's that been working for you all?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"The Underworld has enjoyed over five centuries of peace and is the strongest among the three factions. We have advanced a lot compared to what we were after the Civil War. The general public is happier than ever.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Yup, a politician.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hold on for a moment.\" I turned towards Rias. \"We are going to have some private talk. Can you give us some privacy please?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Eh!\" She looked at me, surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Rias, please do.\" Sirzechs himself asked, looking seriously.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Okay.\" She nodded, although a little reluctantly and went a little distance from us. Sirzechs casted a privacy barrier.</p><p><br></p><p>I started without the worry of displeasing one of my rare friends.</p><p><br></p><p>\"So, you think the Underworld is stable and peaceful? Can drinking poison to quench thirst be called a good move? I don't deny that you four have done a lot of work for the underworld. Much better than what those idiots in the Old Satan faction would have done. But that doesn't mean the Underworld is in a much better position.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing that I got his attention, I continued. \"The Underworld right now is a powder keg waiting to be lit. On the surface, it is the strongest of the three factions, both in number and power but the reality couldn't be further from that. While the Evil Pieces definitely saved the race in a very dangerous situation, it has also gained you all more enemies than the previous Satans combined despite their <em>evil</em> acts. Like the Youkai, the Devils have trampled over several other factions. The only reason they don't say anything is because of you and Ajuka.\"</p><p><br></p><p>He listened but didn’t say a word.</p><p><br></p><p>\"While on the surface the Devils have a lot of population. A major part of it is made by the Reincarnated Devils, many of whom were forced to become devils against their wills. Do you think they suddenly had a change of heart as soon as they became devils and decided that being treated as second class citizens is the way to go? No. They are only quiet because of the Satans. They know that any resistance will be met by you with a swift end.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Not everyone treats their peerage members badly.\" He protested, although the discomfort in his heart was not hidden from my Haki.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I never said <em>everyone</em> did but the majority of them do. You cannot use a minority to define people. Kidnapping people from their homes, against their wills doesn't make them like you. Not to mention their families.\" I shut him up instantly.</p><p><br></p><p>\"And that's only the case for the Reincarnated Devils. Even the Extra Devils and many Pillar Houses are dissatisfied. Let me ask you, how many Pillars are there today?\"</p><p><br></p><p>By now, his face was serious beyond anything. \"Thirty four.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Wrong. Fifty Six.\" I saw him being taken aback at the reveal.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Even if you consider the Pure Blooded Devils Or Clan Traits being a criteria for a House to be alive, there are still fifty six houses alive. So, why is it that only thirty four of them are counted.\"</p><p><br></p><p>His mouth opened but I continued before anything could be said.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Because ultimately what today's Devil race's motivations have been reduced to is not the stupid purity of blood, it's not even the survival or the betterment of the Devil race as you call it. No. It's just <em>profit</em>. There are twenty two houses who are alive but were declared extinct, their lands taken and their positions abolished. When I said that I disliked politics, I meant politics between the houses, not with other factions. If you don’t believe me, search the list of the alive but extinct houses and you will find something very interesting. Do you know what?\"</p><p><br></p><p>He didn't answer but his silence alone gave me the answer I needed.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Each of those houses were the political rivals of the old devils in the council. The so-called Great King Faction. They were systemically sidelined and driven into bankruptcy or even better… fell into the Devil's Sleeping Disease.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"But that's…\" He started, taken aback at the sudden change of direction.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Artificially created. Just examine the list of victims closely. I think Ajuka knows this already. I mean it would be surprising if he didn't. I mean, why do you think it surfaced magically <em>after</em> the Satans died. But more of that later. Do you think any of these houses will support you if a war happens? If you and Ajuka were to die, the current government wouldn't last a decade and that's already pushing it.”</p><p><br></p><p>By this point he was quiet, maybe reeling from the shocking reveal of the Sleeping Illness.</p><p><br></p><p>“And let’s assume that I do take my people to join you all, what then? They would be marginalised, treated with suspicion and partiality and even plotted against. Some of them will encounter <em>accidents</em> while others will fall <em>ill</em>. Children will be left without supervision and forcibly married to the branch houses of the Current Pillars, being absorbed while their own houses. will ultimately <em>go extinct</em> once more.”</p><p><br></p><p>“They will never…” he started but I countered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ingrid Leviathan was attacked and killed one hundred years ago. She was one of the rare few who didn’t participate in the Civil War and even went against her family to stay out. She was killed and her only daughter, half-devil, <em>coincidentally</em> fell ill. She was attacked by Devils and no, it was not the Old Satan Faction. They didn’t even know she was alive. Thankfully she was sent to a safe place by her mother before she fell or she would have been used to <em>rejuvenate</em> the Leviathan blood. Her children wouldn’t have been problems because they could have just used her human ancestry to side-line them. Also, what is this about being Pure Blooded? For a race created by a former Archangel and a former Human, don't you think separation on the basis of blood is stupidity?\"</p><p><br></p><p>I let that sink in and then continued. “In simple words, the current Devil’s Government is a ship full of holes and I… will not take my people onto a sinking ship.”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at me, face not betraying any emotion. The man was shaken. “Is this really what you think of the Devil’s Government?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“I think we should keep this discussion aside for today.” I got up, ready to exit the discussion.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is there really no way that we can cooperate?” He asked, giving the topic a last push.</p><p><br></p><p>“... if, someday, you all decide to man up and clean house… call me. I’ll help.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you have any bad intentions towards the current government?”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“As long as they don’t push for me and mine, no.”</p><p><br></p><p>Currently, everything I am doing, might actually end up saving the Devil Race. Even the upcoming Operation Regicide.</p><p><br><br><br><br></p><p>Sirzechs removed the barrier, his mood still quite sombre.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t care. I had already thrown the bait. He will join me. Sooner or later. It was no longer a question of if but rather, when.</p><p><br></p><p>I mean, as much as I want, I cannot completely separate myself from the Devil Race. The association of this face will always follow me. So, I do need to take some measures for them.</p><p><br></p><p>Right now, I didn’t need them but they needed me.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias noticed the barrier being removed and came back quickly directly in front of me. “Say, you are the Devil, right?”</p><p><br></p><p>A bit taken aback at her question, I noticed the glint in her eyes and identified it as the look she has when she is about to pull a big prank.</p><p><br></p><p>I humoured her. “In the flesh.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I want to make a deal.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs who was lost in his thoughts looked at us but didn’t say anything. He was probably trying to organise whatever he heard.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, what deal?”</p><p><br></p><p>“My father wants to marry me to a guy I don’t like. Help me.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Pfft hahahaha.” I literally burst out laughing.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs seemed to be attracted by the mess too as he looked at her. “Rias you…”</p><p><br></p><p>“What? You people are forcing me to marry that idiot, Riser. I don’t even like him.” She then turned towards me. “Also don’t laugh at me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I was not laughing at you, Princess. I was just laughing at the situation. You know what? I accept your deal.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Really!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Absolutely. Now, there are three ways we can do this. First is the easy way. Second is the slightly harder way. Third is the most troublesome way. Let’s not talk about that for now.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What’s the easy one?” She asked, genuinely intrigued.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, we’ll come to that soon but first let me tell you a story. It was the reason I laughed. You see, there was once a girl whose <em>Father</em> wanted to marry her to someone she didn’t like. So she went and asked a guy for help. They ran away together and got married. Simple right.”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded her head while Sirzechs kept listening while not saying anything. He was probably trying to take in everything about my personality from today’s meeting.</p><p><br></p><p>Well, let him have a massive headache then.</p><p><br></p><p>“But what’s so special about it?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, the special thing is… the guy she asked for help was called… Lucifer.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs’ eyes widened as he realised what I was saying while Rias was still catching up.</p><p><br></p><p>“The father in this story was also Lucifer’s Father. So, tell me, do you know the name of the girl?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Lilith.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Correct Princess. Now, the easiest method would be to go on an Underworld wide television broadcast and tell this story to everyone and then the thing about you asking me for help. I guarantee you, that your father or any other devil would dare… To force you then.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Stop giving her crazy ideas?” Sirzechs interrupted me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hey, I am just helping. And it’s not really hard. You will have to agree that it is in fact the easiest method.”</p><p><br></p><p>Rias seemed confused about the whole thing and asked me. “Why? What will happen if I do this? Would father even cancel the engagement?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, he obviously will, dear. If he doesn't, at the very least, half the population will rebel against him.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What!”</p><p><br></p><p>“The Devil Race was created on the idea of freedom. The freedom to pursue one’s emotions. Lucifer, the Archangel of Light and Desires, had an altercation with his father about allowing Angels to pursue their desires and not be puppets used to merely guide humans. This led to a fight and he left Heaven and created the Devil Race with Lilith. The Devil were allowed to pursue all their desires, provided they didn’t harm each other. This is or from what I can see now, was the basic law that governed the Devil Race. Forcing something like a marriage on someone against their will is a blatant slap on the face of this law. It will not be allowed.” I looked at Sirzechs. “What was your father even thinking about? Is he perhaps taking the role of Lucifer’s father too literally? What’s next, starting a Great War?”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>She looked a mix of fascinated and discomforted at the news.</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t want to cause trouble for my family. What is the second method.” She spoke after a moment.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s awfully kind and mature of you Princess. Well done. The next method is, well you can train hard, get strong and when you are a month from eighteen, beat the idiot you are engaged to, into the ground. Then declare that you won’t marry anyone weaker than yourself. Easy.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Can I do that?” She looked at Sirzechs who looked quite calm now that his little sister was not thinking about nuking their family reputation in front of the whole underworld and nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wait! But, how do you help me with this? I mean, if I do everything on my own, how would that even be fair?” She put her hands on her waist and looked at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, you drive a hard bargain, Princess. Then… how about I help you out on this?”</p><p><br></p><p>“How?”</p><p><br></p><p>I took her hand and lifted it up. “You have always heard me saying I am the Devil, right?” She nodded. Let me prove why. Calling it a blessing sounds too holy for my tastes. So, let’s call it the ‘Kiss of the Devil’.”</p><p><br></p><p>I placed a kiss on the back of her hand and gave her the nerfed essences. The Archmage Essence and The Blank Essences. “From today, anything you try to learn can be learned and your talent will increase with time. You will not encounter any limits and can grow endlessly as long as you put some effort into it. There. All done.\"</p><p>I looked at Sirzechs, surprised that he didn't stop me. He perhaps sensed my gaze and understood. \"You didn't hurt her the last time which would have been easier. There is no reason for you to do it this time either.\"</p><p>Rias checked herself. I didn't send the information in her head so she looked a little suspicious. \"You are not tricking me, right?\"</p><p>\"I wouldn't dare.\"</p><p>\"I don't feel any different.\"</p><p>\"Oh, what were you expecting? Overwhelming power? That's my Kiss of the Devil. not the Nine Tails Chakra.” She blushed. “You know what, hold on a moment.\" I knew exactly what to do.</p><p>The price of this deal and the final bait towards Sirzechs.</p><p>I brought out a shining orb from my pocket.</p><p>\"Here. Use this.\"</p><p>\"What's this?\"</p><p>\"Crush it.\"</p><p>She did and a light shined around her, ending up on her left arm.</p><p>Sirzechs who was ready to intervene was stilled on hearing the next sound.</p><p><strong><em>\"Boost.\"</em></strong></p><p>I didn't care and ruffled the hair on her head. \"There you go. This should be enough.\"</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Sirzechs who was looking at me with both a shocked and a questioning gaze. \"Why?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I said I didn't want to get involved in your matters <a href=\"https://but….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">but….it</a> would be a pity to see a race created by my family die. Consider this as me buying you some time.\"</p><p><br></p><p>I again looked at Rias who was looking at the gauntlet in awe. \"Now then Princess, I think you know what this is and that I have already carried out my end of the deal. It's your turn now.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"O-oh. What do you want? \"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I want… you to become my sister's rival.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Huh?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"My sister has been growing at a very rapid speed, only matched by my subordinates and me. This has led her to become very overconfident, thinking that she can only be defeated by one of my subordinates or me. I don't want her to live in this delusion. So… I want you to become stronger and fight my sister, once every year at least,till both of you come of age.\" </p><p><br></p><p>Both looked at me with an open mouthed look.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Moreover, don't you think it's cool this way? Both are Little sisters of Lucifers, wielders of Heavenly Dragons, rivals. And even the colour themes match.\"</p><p><br></p><p>She took a deep breath. \"I will train harder.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Good. That's the spirit.\"</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the time and two hours had almost passed.</p><p><br></p><p>Gretel had come back during this time as well. She was… controlling herself but I could sense her emotions being a mess. Grayfia looked the same.</p><p><br></p><p>Today must have been very taxing on everyone.</p><p><br></p><p>I need to go back and prepare too.</p><p><br></p><p>Rizevim knows about me and will be actively starting his game.</p><p><br></p><p>Add on to that, Lilith, Satanic Arms- Melbranche and Project Regicide. Not to mention the supposed rebellion of Sataneel. My days suddenly became very hectic.</p><p><br></p><p>\"It's time for us to leave. Take care, Princess. And congratulations on your new peerage member.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Thanks. B-by the way, you only told me about two ways. What was the third?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"The third… that would involve me waking up a sleeping midget with a camel fetish, in your basement and having a talk with her. Too troublesome.\"</p><p><br></p><p>She looked confused but Sirzechs was taken aback.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy has been doing that a lot today.</p><p><br></p><p>\"How do yo…\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I know many things that you don't. I think we already established that a few minutes ago.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Rias on the other hand looked at him in surprise. \"We have a pervert hidden in our house?\"</p><p><br></p><p>That… made me laugh hard.</p><p><br></p><p>Let them have some headache.</p><p><br></p><p>I took Gretel and we looked at the trio as we teleported away.</p><p><br></p><p>Everything just got more complicated.</p><p><br></p><p>________________x_________________________________x_________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: LuluViBritania(FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author's Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Support me on:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>htt-ps://www-.patr-eon.-com/-crossedge</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Deal with the Devil always takes a lot out of me.

My hands roaming on her naked back as she moaned in my ears and grinded herself in my lap.</p><p><br></p><p>I laid her on her back on the bed as her legs gripped me and took a look at her stunning form made even more enchanting due to the moonlight falling on her.</p><p><br></p><p>Silver hair spread all over the bed and a pair of half closed red eyes stared at me clouded in lust. Her skin was completely flawless, shapely breasts going up and down as she breathed heavily, her pink nipples were perked at the moment from all the excitement.</p><p><br></p><p>The entire scene was intoxicating.</p><p><br></p><p>I pounced on her, my hands taking one of her breasts in my grip while my lips reaching the other.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“Ahhhh  mhhhhh.”</em></p><p><br></p><p>Her soft moans tickled my ears as my tongue rolled over her nipple as I sucked and kissed her breasts.</p><p><br></p><p>Her hand roamed on the back of my head, her fingers gripping my hair as I took a playful bite, holding and pushing me into her bosom with even more force.</p><p><br></p><p>My fingers rolled her other nipple between them as I slowly moved down.</p><p><br></p><p>Leaving a trail of kisses from her stomach towards her core which was radiating heat at this point.</p><p><br></p><p>Only a thin layer of silk was separating us at this point and I pushed forwards, lightly kissing the place.</p><p><br></p><p>“Master~”</p><p><br></p><p>I moved the piece of cloth aside and looked at the neatly trimmed patch of silver hair above the pink lips which were wet with arousal and gave it a lick, making her shiver as she placed a hand on her mouth to stifle her moan.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t stop your voice. Let it out. I like hearing your voice, Gretel.”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at me with a red face, her eyes filled with embarrassment as she looked pleadingly at me.</p><p><br></p><p>Honestly, this look just wants me to bully her more.</p><p><br></p><p>I pulled her up by her hips so that her waist was raised and her head was on the bed, and dove into her heated core all the while keeping eye contact.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“Mmmhh ahhh.”</em> She gripped my hair harder as I explored every corner of her soaking cunt with my tongue.</p><p><br></p><p>One of my fingers entered her. She already broke her hymen due to the intense training we were undergoing. She was previously afraid of what I would think of it.</p><p><br></p><p>This silly girl.</p><p><br></p><p>Her inner muscles gripped my finger and massaged it as I rubbed her insides, all the while my tongue continued its work on her.</p><p><br></p><p>A few minutes of intense stimulation later, her entire body shuddered as her hips jerked upwards as she climaxed first.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked in wonder and pride at my work.</p><p><br></p><p>Her silver hair was all messed up while some of it was sticking to her face with her sweat. Her breasts went up and down as she heaved for her breath.</p><p><br></p><p>I leaned onto her and she put an arm around me as our lips met once more. This time, instead of the intense lust, there was a slow and loving feel to the kiss.</p><p><br></p><p>We pulled apart from the kiss and a very thin strand of saliva was connected between our tongues.</p><p><br></p><p>“Please let me take care of you too, Master.” She whispered and pushed me to lie on my back.</p><p><br></p><p>She gave me a light peck on my lips as she went down, pulling my underwear down with her.</p><p><br></p><p>I was rock hard by this time and my cock sprung up, hitting her face. She held it and kissed the tip first before giving it a lick.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at me in the eye and took the tip in her mouth and I let out a groan of satisfaction as she moved her tongue over the tip, slowly covering the whole tip with her saliva and then moving down.</p><p><br></p><p>I caressed her head, running my fingers through her silky hair all the while maintaining eye contact.</p><p><br></p><p>It was at this instant that the door to our room opened, making us quickly cover ourselves.</p><p><br></p><p>Lavinia entered the room and without a word walked to the bed before laying on the side and snuggling against me.</p><p><br></p><p>Gretel and I looked at each other as we both let out a sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is the third time.” I broke the silence.</p><p><br></p><p>“I locked the room… with magic.” She replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s not like we didn’t try that before. She becomes a magical genius in her sleep somehow.”</p><p><br></p><p>“If you didn’t check it before, I would still think she is pulling our legs.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You say that? I actually began to doubt my own powers when I got the results.”</p><p><br></p><p>This was not the first time this had happened.</p><p><br></p><p>Lavinia was a sleepwalker. She walked into other people’s rooms when she was asleep if there was no one beside her to cuddle, mostly ours because she was just used to it at this point.</p><p><br></p><p>She had walked in on us twice before this and she was completely oblivious the next day.</p><p><br></p><p>I had questioned and even used my ‘Prince of Lies’ on her to verify it. She was genuinely sleepwalking all this time.</p><p><br></p><p>At this point, we just learned to roll with it.</p><p><br></p><p>It was because I discovered a few things about us.</p><p><br></p><p>Gretel was a bit of a masochist.</p><p><br></p><p>I myself, was a bit of a sadist… surprisingly.</p><p><br></p><p>And Lavinia was a very heavy sleeper.</p><p><br></p><p>Thus, my smirk widened even more when I saw Gretel’s panicked eyes when I put a hand behind her head again.</p><p><br></p><p>My cute maid already knew what I was thinking.</p><p><br></p><p>“Master!”</p><p><br></p><p>“You said you will take care of me.” I smirked. “And I don’t think I can sleep like this.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But… she will wake up.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then we just need to be more careful.” Moreover, she came to our room. Sleepwalking or not, she should be prepared for the consequences.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Vienna gave us some alone time since the first day she figured out what was going on.</p><p><br></p><p>I was careless to forget about her Observation Haki.</p><p><br></p><p>The smug looks Merlin and Sean threw at me were obvious when both of us came out.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka was the only one who was disappointed, not unhappy… just disappointed that she was not the first.</p><p><br></p><p>Most of them were not even surprised. The most annoying thing was that there was a fucking betting pool going on about when we will get together.</p><p><br></p><p>It wasn’t even an ‘if’ situation but rather ‘when’.</p><p><br></p><p>It was annoying for a few days but at the end of it, not much changed.</p><p><br></p><p>There were a few changes though. Gretel started being happier. She was somehow… more free.</p><p><br></p><p>And… I guess, I became happier too.</p><p><br></p><p>Gretel looked at me for a moment with a pleading look and then at Lavinia was sleeping peacefully. The sheer contrast in their expressions was wonderful. Taking a deep breath, she pulled the blanket over us and got down.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t get to see her ruby-like eyes looking at me but the familiar warmth enveloped my lower head once more and I let out a groan of pleasure.</p><p><br></p><p>Gretel had become playful too. This girl was trying to put me in the spot by making me moan.</p><p><br></p><p>I… just didn’t care.</p><p><br></p><p>Lavinia had made her interest clear a long time ago.</p><p><br></p><p>After all, there was a reason she never wandered into Sean or Merlin’s rooms… ever.</p><p><br></p><p>I just want my relationship with Gretel to stabilize a bit first and then I would try to get into any other relationship. This was not something Gretel minded either.</p><p><br></p><p>She could be downright vicious when she wanted to but Lavinia had just broken past her defenses long ago.</p><p><br></p><p>The bedsheets moved up and down as she got into it and I caressed her hair under the blankets.</p><p><br></p><p>I felt my climax approaching and pushed her down lightly. She understood what I wanted and took more of my length in and this pushed me over the edge.</p><p><br></p><p>I shot ropes of cum inside her throat, jerking my waist.</p><p><br></p><p>A few moments later, Gretel came out from under the blanket and laid by me, all cleaned up.</p><p><br></p><p>I was however far from being done.</p><p><br></p><p>Asmodeus was an Incubus, a Sex Demon and I did have his blood. Since two months ago, when I started a physical relationship with Gretel, I have been insatiable. I did get it a lot under control but it was still like a dam had broken.</p><p><br></p><p>Getting a release only once… yeah, not enough.</p><p><br></p><p>I pulled her up to me and got on top of her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Master!” She asked, shocked but never tried once to stop me. In fact, her legs spread lightly to accomodate me as she took a quick look at Lavinia on our side.</p><p><br></p><p>I rubbed my length on her core, both of us slick with wetness and she took a hold of me and positioned me at her entrance. I looked at her and no more words were needed.</p><p><br></p><p>I locked lips with her as I pushed in and she moaned in my mouth.</p><p><br></p><p>She was absolutely smoldering on the inside and her legs wrapped around me, pulling me.</p><p><br></p><p>I let myself go as I pounded her into the bed, getting my second release a while later while she came several times.</p><p><br></p><p>One more round for me and Gretel was exhausted. This was one of the reasons why Gretel didn’t mind Lavinia. She knew that she was getting exhausted too soon while I just got more energized the more I had sex. I was not even using my Passion Magic. I just decided to push things for a bit later, until she was more comfortable.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, I pulled her on top of me and rocked her body, enjoying a peaceful round of lovemaking at a slow pace.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are… what if she woke up?”</p><p><br></p><p>“If she did, it’s on her own. And don’t talk like you didn’t like it. I am pretty sure you were tighter when she was sleeping beside us.</p><p><br></p><p>“I-I wasn’t.” She blushed to her ears and hid her face in my chest and I gave her a thrust from below making her moan and look at me with a pout.</p><p><br></p><p>Our attentions were shifted by murmurs of Lavinia in her sleep who was still oblivious all this time and we both cracked up a little at the innocent girl who slept beside us without a care in the world</p><p><br></p><p>____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>“We have established a business contract with the Sitri House to step into the Health Industry of the Underworld. They also tried to contact Alicia regarding doing shows together for Serafall’s next movie.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ophelia reported before looking at Alicia who nodded at the statement. I was getting reports about the recent events from my subordinates.</p><p><br></p><p>“They are trying to spread out and reduce the influence of the Great King faction over the Underworld’s economy. Currently, the Great King faction keeps their power by having near unbreakable control over the Underworld’s economy so much so that most of the houses who have not sided with them and are not in any major faction were all bankrupted. Important people falling into Sleeping Sickness and other houses making business maneuvers to completely ruin their businesses. This is one of the major reasons why even with all the drama they cause, the current Satans cannot do anything to them. These people could crash the entire Devil’s economy in a matter of days.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ophelia explained and I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“So, they are trying to use you and Alicia who have kept away from any other faction and still maintained your businesses.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I maintain a good relationship with all the factions while not actively being a part of either of them. I was able to avoid the Great King faction because I mainly dealt in the Human world and also because the Paimon’s during the Civil War supported the Old Satans. It was only after my father supposedly <em>died</em> that we shifted to the current side.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Charlene and she explained the main reasons for it.</p><p><br></p><p>“They are worried because of the stunt they pulled with the Youkai during the execution ceremony.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Those random attacks?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. They had organized several attacks at different parts of the Youkai territory to intimidate the Youkai. Most of them were paid mercenaries and even stray devils. Several exorcists and onmyojis also got anonymous donations and contracts to go after the Youkai. They just denied everything while the Youkai were beyond furious.” Charlene explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“Still, Yasaka, that woman, is something else. She publicly burned each and every captive alive in reply and then did the same to everyone who was caught in the attacks. She went so far as to destroy two entire clans of Onmyojis who were involved. The Nura Clan were known for their roughhousing when dealing with others but this was the first time that the ones under Yasaka did such a thing, not to mention the leader herself. All this had completely shaken anyone who wanted to cause any trouble and the attacks mostly ceased in two months.” Helena said.</p><p><br></p><p>“They were all used to dealing with the soft spoken Youkai all this time and unsure on how to deal with this new Yasaka. Sometimes people forget that Nine Tailed Foxes have been beasts of calamity and natural disasters for a reason. Just because they wear a shrine maiden dress and prefer a relatively non-violent life now, doesn’t mean they lost their claws and strength. Sun Wukong was someone who had caused trouble for even Gods before he settled down as a Buddha.” I explained. “Akira told me that he was going out on some of these so-called hunts. I just didn’t know the exact details of what was happening.”</p><p><br></p><p>I had kinda secluded myself for the last bit of my training and experimenting on my Demonification powers and a trump card for myself.</p><p><br></p><p>“He was the other one heading the hunts. The Youkai in both the Eastern and Western Youkai Factions know him as Yasaka’s student even with him never showing his face. Even his half Devil side doesn’t phase them because Yasaka vouched for him. Not to mention, another Nine Tailed Fox among their midst was like a boon to them.” Merlin explained.</p><p><br></p><p>Akira gained his Ninth Tail a month ago while Kuroka who joined us for training under Merlin’s Innovate Clear did the same. They were both certified Satan Class beings now.</p><p><br></p><p>“Their actions were tantamount to starting a war. Attacks from individuals can be taken care of by declaring them rogue but organized attacks on such a scale is a whole nother thing. I guess the other factions who were a little intimidated with the Youkai’s growing power only held back because they were afraid of the intervention of the mysterious powerhouse who took down the entire Kyoto Youkai rebel army. They were probably waiting for another such appearance to glean in on some information. The Satans didn’t make any comments but they are making some effort to curb the Great King faction’s power over the Underworld.” said Charlene.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is good news for us. There are more than a few extremists among the Great King faction who are not much different from the fools in the Old Satan faction. They are used to getting their way for a long time because the New Satans are more of a moderate bunch when it comes to the internal affairs, probably because they are still haunted by the memories of the civil war and are trying to avoid any more of those. This situation might have been the first solid slap to their faces. Find a way to contact Katerea and call her for a meeting. It’s about time I marked her.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you planning on getting those dissatisfied Devils to join the Old Satan faction? It will not happen. They know far better than others what is in store for them there.” Charlene replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“There is a price for people like these. Also, I don’t want them to join the Old Satan faction. I just want them to communicate with each other, maybe have some exchanges and even use each other to cause trouble for the current government. Doesn’t matter if nothing comes of it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It might not be so bad. I have heard from some of my sources in the Old Satan faction that the Nebiros are now in contact with them because of the execution of the previous Heir during the Youkai fiasco. It might just convince others to do the same.” Ophelia supplied.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good. Let them continue and monitor them.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Merlin. “What’s the news about Odin?”</p><p><br></p><p>The two years that Odin had given me were coming to an end and I needed to be at a decent amount of strength to be able to represent a Faction of my own.</p><p><br></p><p>Our entire faction might only be around twenty thousand people but our average strength was much higher than any of the Three factions. The new and perfected Enhancement Drug and the insane training regime has made the people under me a force to be reckoned with.</p><p><br></p><p>Not to mention the strength of our top level people.</p><p><br></p><p>I have finally touched the cusps of the Super Devil level myself without my Telos Karma while Gretel and Ingvild can fight at that level when using their Sacred Gears. The same was true for Merlin. Cleria, Lavinia, Hagoromo Gitsune and Sean were beyond Satan Class while the other members except the kids were all Satan Class individuals.</p><p><br></p><p>On a conservative estimate, our current strength was almost on par with the Fallen Angels while they had ten times our numbers.</p><p><br></p><p>Safe to say that we are far stronger than any mid level factions like the Youkai.</p><p><br></p><p>“He’s ready whenever we are. The Restoration Potion has been perfected and can rival the Phenex Tears. In fact, Azazel has been asking me about this too. He is going to meet Odin in a week. Do you want to finalise the deal then?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do it. Organise the meeting.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What about the Dhampir children, Ophelia?”</p><p><br></p><p>“We have gotten close to the Tepes Faction and established a few ins. The children are mostly kept in the dungeons. In about a month, the main force of the Tepes faction will go on a meeting, leaving the castle’s defences severely weakened and we will take that opportunity to sneak the children out of there.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Good. Just in case, Lavinia, accompany them too. If you need any help, you can ask Gretel.” Then nodded in reply.</p><p><br></p><p>The last two Holy Relics were the last things I needed. With those, I can be sure about revealing myself to the world.</p><p><br></p><p>With those two, I can be more or less sure of surpassing Sirzechs in terms of power too.</p><p><br></p><p>Not that I can’t fight against him right now. I could probably fight him to a standstill with my own power, let alone if I use the Telos Karma but if Ajuka or others join him, things would get problematic.</p><p><br></p><p>I would still win if I used my trump card but it would be dangerous for me.</p><p><br></p><p>We discussed a few more things and made some plans about getting Valerie out of the place.</p><p><br></p><p>____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I walked into the room which was reserved for the meeting. Merlin and Celine followed me. Celine had her face covered under a hood. Our charm, turning most of the heads towards us as we walked by.</p><p><br></p><p>I knocked at the room’s door and a bearded guy opened the door.</p><p><br></p><p>He stilled, eyes widened as he looked at me.</p><p><br></p><p>Thankfully, Merlin took control of the situation. “Barakiel, long time since I last saw you? How have you been, old friend?”</p><p><br></p><p>The man’s eyes stayed on me a few seconds more before he turned to Merlin and gave him a nod. “Same for me. It’s great to see you too, Merlin. Come in.”</p><p><br></p><p>I gave him a nod and got into the room.</p><p><br></p><p>First meeting was with Azazel and the Fallen regarding the same trade offers that we were giving the Norse.</p><p><br></p><p>Healing Items were of great use for many.</p><p><br></p><p>Inside the room sat Azazel with a silver haired man and a purple haired woman both of whom were fallen Angels too.</p><p><br></p><p>They saw me and had a reaction similar to Barakiel.</p><p><br></p><p>“Welcome Damien. This is your first time meeting them, so I will introduce you. These are Semhazai, Barakiel and Penemue. I think you must have already heard about them.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hello. My name is Damien Lucifer.\" I nodded lightly.</p><p><br></p><p>They were still eerily quiet before Shemhazai opened his mouth. \"I know Azazel said you looked like <em>him</em> but still….  This is just….\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I get that a lot.\" I merely shrugged.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I am not surprised that you do. I would love to see the look on other people's faces when they see you.\" Penemue laughed. \"Michael would have a heart-attack for sure.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I would get a light spear to the face before such a thing happened.\" I chuckled at the comment.</p><p><br></p><p>\"So, who’s the one hiding under the hood? Introduce us.” Azazel asked, looking at the third member of our group.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked back and signalled her to remove the hood and she did.</p><p><br></p><p>The eyes of the three men popped out while the other woman got up from her seat and directly came to hug her.</p><p><br></p><p>I saw Celine still for a moment but she didn’t push her back.</p><p><br></p><p>A year or two ago, that would have been impossible.</p><p><br></p><p>And thus began our meeting.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Lavinia -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Lavinia was running through the forests with another person in her arms. The fellow blonde in her arms.</p><p><br></p><p>The mission was turning out to be more troublesome than she had thought, not to mention way out of time. There were still around two weeks till all the high ranking vampires went out.</p><p><br></p><p>But that didn’t happen.</p><p><br></p><p>She was called urgently by Ophelia when she found out about the changes. One thing led to another and now she was being chased by other devils.</p><p><br></p><p>The vampires had met with other devils who wanted to buy the Damphirs and the worst part was that the said devils were from the Old Satan faction.</p><p><br></p><p>Ophelia’s contacts were able to help the children flee but both were separated on their way out.</p><p><br></p><p>She was able to get the girl at the right time while there was some commotion on the other side too.</p><p><br></p><p>From what she understood, there were three parties overall.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, she was being chased by one of the parties who wanted the Damphirs but couldn’t fight because the girl was injured and needed help.</p><p><br></p><p>Her Observation Haki sensed something and she flew out of the way as a huge section of the forest was frozen instantly. Even the ones chasing her were completely frozen.</p><p><br></p><p>She took on a defensive stance and sent a Shadow Clone to hide in the snow while she faced the enemy in front of her. The attack just now was at the level of an Ultimate Class but the speed at which it was cast made it clear that whoever it was, they were experienced in combat.</p><p><br></p><p>A man came out of the fog in front of her.</p><p><br></p><p>He had braided silver hair and an aristocratic look. His arm was covered by a gauntlet which was giving out a disgusting aura.</p><p><br></p><p>It was… Lavinia knew of this person.</p><p><br></p><p>She had been taught about him since she had joined Big Sis Cleria’s peerage.</p><p><br></p><p>Euclid Lucifuge.</p><p><br></p><p>The person whom Gretel hated the most. She knew about Gretel’s past. The two of them were very close, probably because they were of similar ages and Lavinia thought of her like a sister.</p><p><br></p><p>This person… he was single handedly responsible for most of her suffering.</p><p><br></p><p>Her magic sensed her emotions as the already freezing forest around her started to freeze even more and Demi appeared behind her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! It seems that you have some skill.” He looked around and raised an eyebrow. “I thought I caught up with the wrong group and wasted my time. Who would have thought that I would meet an interesting person like this. An independent Avatar type Sacred Gear and one of the best at that. Absolute Demise. If I didn’t have my new toy, it would have suited me perfectly. Well, it doesn’t matter. I can always get one for later.”</p><p><br></p><p>The temperature fell down even more and Lavinia suddenly heard a groan from the girl. She had been given one of the Restoration Potions and had healed quickly but the cold and the pressure of the Demonic Power from two Satan Class beings would be too much for a child like her to handle.</p><p><br></p><p>Damien needed this girl to help him heal so she cannot endanger the safety of this girl.</p><p><br></p><p>She was about to attack and look around for an opportunity to run away.</p><p><br></p><p>Her shadow clone was ready to make a move when she found three other energy signals.</p><p><br></p><p>One of them was relatively weak, at the higher levels of High Class while another one was Satan Class but still not someone Lavinia would have bothered about.</p><p><br></p><p>The main deterrence was the last one.</p><p><br></p><p>This energy felt <em>huge</em>. At the level of Damien and Lavinia knew that people at that level could be counted on her two hands with fingers to spare.</p><p><br></p><p>She had already reported the situation and backup was being sent. At worst, she had to hold on for a while. Lavinia lightly looked at the new arrivals warily.</p><p><br></p><p>The first one was a crimson haired girl around Kuroka's age with another man who looked clearly related to her. It was the last person that made both her and her attack pause.</p><p><br></p><p>Silver hair, red eyes. She looked like a slightly mature version of Gretel.</p><p><br></p><p>At this point, Lavinia would be a fool to not know the identities of the new arrivals.</p><p><br></p><p>The woman herself was stunned into silence as she quietly looked towards the silver haired man.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Grayfia Lucifuge -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She watched with wide eyes at the person she thought to be dead for so long.</p><p><br></p><p>How did it come to this?</p><p><br></p><p>It was supposed to be a simple job.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs had been extremely stressed with the current political environment of the Underworld and when he found out about a certain Damphir from his sources, he took an opportunity to take a break from his work and bring Rias to find and perhaps recruit the child after some negotiations with the Vampires.</p><p><br></p><p>The plan went awry when there was a commotion and the said child ran away and was hurt. Fortunately, they found the child at the right time and Rias was able to reincarnate him. And she was lucky too. Even with her much higher than normal strength, she needed to use a Mutated Bishop Piece to reincarnate the boy which showed his extremely high potential.</p><p><br></p><p>It was after that things went awry. There was a lot of commotion and they decided to check out the large attack in the nearby forest.</p><p><br></p><p>Never in her life did Grayfia imagine that the one she would find in the midst of it all would be her supposedly dead brother.</p><p><br></p><p>“Euclid.” She called, her voice laden with guilt.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hello Grayfia.” His voice was cold, almost detached but she could see the emotions in his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“I thought…”</p><p><br></p><p>“And you should keep on thinking that. The Euclid you knew is dead.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Euclid, pleas…” Sirzechs tried to mediate but was shut between his words.</p><p><br></p><p>“Be quiet, pretender.”</p><p><br></p><p>Grayfia flinched at the sheer hate in the voice.</p><p><br></p><p>Before they could do or say anything else, a corner of the field blasted and the girl who was facing Euclid used her Sacred Gear to create a snowstorm. It was apparently a distraction and the girl herself tried to flee with the other child in her arms.</p><p><br></p><p>Euclid attacked without hesitation sending a large volley of ice, cutting her path. The girl dodged and made an ice wall instantly to protect herself and the girl and took another defence position.</p><p><br></p><p>“I haven’t allowed you to leave. The Monster of Tepes belongs to us.”</p><p><br></p><p>“She is not a monster.” The girl replied curtly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, yes. She isn’t. The monster went the other way. But at least I caught an interesting fly in all this. I do need to find who is after the monster… and you will answer me.”</p><p><br></p><p>The other girl was a devil too.</p><p><br></p><p>She wanted to intervene but Sirzechs held her shoulder. She looked at him and saw the serious look in his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“The girl is holding back. She is trying to protect the child. If you interfere, there is a high chance that she may stop doing so. A Longinus is called such for a reason. Don’t push the other party into a corner. We will interfere if things get out of hand.” She paused at the statement and looked at the scene while Sirzechs erected a barrier to protect her and Rias.</p><p><br></p><p>The fight went on for a few minutes and Grayfia noticed that the girl was indeed holding back a lot. She was covering the girl under a barrier all the time while fighting Euclid who was starting to increase the power behind his attacks to a level that would even make her become serious in a real fight.</p><p><br></p><p>She saw that Euclid was getting madder and the gauntlet on his arm was pulsing before he let out a rage filled shout and a massive wave of ice attacked the girl.</p><p><br></p><p>The attack was dangerous. Grayfia knew that even she would have to avoid an attack like that and not face it head on. It was way beyond what Euclid she knew was capable of… then again, she hadn’t known him for centuries now. Still, the suspicious looking gauntlet on his arm gave her a nasty feeling. It felt as if feeding on his negative emotions.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs shielded them all with his Power of Destruction as normal barriers wouldn’t have worked.</p><p><br></p><p>The attack headed towards the other girl, looking unstoppable as it crushed everything in its path.</p><p><br></p><p>And then it happened. She didn’t even feel it and would have completely missed it if not for her centuries long battle experience. There was a tremor in space and the tsunami of ice heading towards the girl… was directly torn apart… instantly. Euclid cast dozens of barriers which were all torn apart just as if they didn’t even exist in the first place. They however, still gained him enough time as he barely dodged. The attack from the other side continued tearing apart everything in its way. She felt a chill in her spine seeing the final results of the attack.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a several mile long trench with no end visible. The space in the area looked as if it had been distorted and was slowly fixing itself. That attack had torn apart the very fabric of space. Even Sirzechs was tense for a moment as they all looked at the attacker.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a fog in the area but with their supernatural hearing, they could hear the sound of footsteps.</p><p><br></p><p>The sound grew louder and the other girl was the first one to realise the other party’s identity as she relaxed slightly.</p><p><br></p><p>Soon enough they all saw the other party as well and Grayfia felt as if she had forgotten to breathe.</p><p><br></p><p>Silver hair, red eyes, dressed in a maid’s clothing. It was like a younger version of her looking straight back at her. She turned and looked at Euclid who was looking stunned as well but she realised that he knew her with his next words as he addressed her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Gretel!” he whispered.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl however paid him no mind and looked at the other girl and waved a hand.</p><p><br></p><p>A fog emerged and wrapped around the child they were protecting and in the very next second, the child was gone. Then she looked at the other girl. “Are you alright?”</p><p><br></p><p>The girl nodded and quickly got beside her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you ignoring me? Have you grown so much that you dare ignore me!” Euclid shouted. “I created you. I made you what you are and you… It’s because of him, isn’t it? That, no good tr…”</p><p><br></p><p>The space twisted all around Euclid, and Grayfia almost at reflex erected an ice wall and several barriers around him to protect his life.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl looked towards her and Grayfia flinched at the glare. It was not the power of the girl that made her flinch. She had seen and stood against Sirzechs in fights. She could fight against this level of power.</p><p><br></p><p>No. It was the sheer range of emotions behind those eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Hatred, betrayal, anger but most of all… pain. She looked on in shock as her lips moved and even though no sound came out Grayfia knew what she had said.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“Traitor.”</em></p><p><br></p><p>Who was this girl?</p><p><br></p><p>Euclid said he created her?</p><p><br></p><p>Was she Euclid’s daughter?</p><p><br></p><p>Just what happened between them?</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at the wreckage and saw Euclid standing there, but not uninjured.</p><p><br></p><p>One of his arms was missing and he had a large gash on his body.</p><p><br></p><p>Even with all those barriers.</p><p><br></p><p>Though it was not the end of surprises. The arm with the gauntlet was releasing miasma and strings of black smoke attached itself to the cut off arm and pulled it back and attached. His gashes were covered with smoke too and the bleeding stopped. He seemed gasping for breath so the attack must have used a lot of his strength.</p><p><br></p><p>The aura was sickening, almost similar to the pits. Did he experiment on himself?</p><p><br></p><p>“Insult my Master again and the next time I won’t stop with just an arm.” The girl spoke in a very low voice but with a tone more chilling than any ice spell that had been cast.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is Vampire territory. Any fights in this place would cause problems for everyone. Can we just solve this peacefully or at least move this somewhere else?” Sirzechs stepped up and asked as both the girls looked at him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Gretel… we should go for now. This is not the right time.” The blonde one urged.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl however looked in the other direction and soon enough the blonde also followed her gaze. “I’m afraid that it’s too late for that.”</p><p><br></p><p>She quickly spread her senses and then she felt it.</p><p><br></p><p>A massive aura approaching them at a high speed.</p><p><br></p><p>Even before it reached them, the snow was blowing from the path of approach, drowning the trees and when it finally reached them, she saw the face of the being as Sirzechs stepped in front of her and Rias protectively and she casted several barriers around themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>Silver hair, silver goatee and blue eyes, although one side was covered in an eyepatch. Did Rizevim have an accident?</p><p><br></p><p>She saw the face of that demon turn to glee as he took in the view of everyone here, his eyes finally stopping at the girl, lighting up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Uyahahahaha what a gathering this is. I heard a commotion around the area and came to take a look. You know how much I love some good ol’ evil. Someone destroying the entire landscape seemed like fun… but to think I would encounter this. What is this, a family reunion of yours, Euclid? You and your sisters… both old and young.”</p><p><br></p><p>Grayfia hand shook at the words and she quickly snapped in the girl’s direction.</p><p><br></p><p>Sister?</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, you didn’t tell her? My oh my, that’s awfully inconsiderate of you, Euclid. Shy of some introductions, are we? Well, let me introduce them then. Dear Grayfia, meet your youngest sister, Gretel Lucifuge. You know, back then when Euclid told you that he <em>took care of your mother</em>. Well… He lied. A perfectly evil plan, if I do say so myself. Euclid was always talented in those. What? Surprised, right! Right!”</p><p><br></p><p>A sudden feeling of dread arose in her heart as she felt Sirzechs’ arm grasping her hand. She looked at Euclid who was only glaring at the two of them with a bestial rage and Rizevim continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“Seriously though, both your sisters left you for other guys… really, your Luck with your sisters is awful. I think you had better luck poking your mother with your late father’s DNA to make more babies, or maybe, you should have just left one of your three brothers alive. Weak they may have been, they might just have been more… loyal.”</p><p><br></p><p>The words sounded like bombs in her ears and all the while she looked at Euclid trying to find even a semblance of clue of them being false and yet found nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>“Grayfia… Control yourself. Don’t let him get into your head.” Sirzechs’ voice sounded and she snapped back. She hadn’t realised that her barriers had almost fallen.</p><p><br></p><p>She strengthened the barriers quickly, although she looked back at the girl once more, her mind catching up with the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>Rizevim however was done having fun with her and looked at Gretel. “Oya look at you Gretel. You have grown so big. And here we all thought that you died. Uncle Rizevim was so sad, you know? So now tell me Gretel, if you are alive… Does it mean that <em>He</em> is alive as well?”</p><p><br></p><p>She realised that the girl had stilled.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Gretel Lucifuge -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She calculated all the possible ways to flee from this situation. Losing control of her emotions and stopping was a mistake, one that she regretted instantly.</p><p><br></p><p>Yet, it was so hard to control herself from tearing apart that face when she saw him after all these years.</p><p><br></p><p>“Lavinia, I will look for an opportunity for you. Leave.” She whispered to her.</p><p><br></p><p>Lavinia looked back at her in shock and shook her head. “I am not leaving you alone. I can fight as well.”</p><p><br></p><p>No, she can’t.</p><p><br></p><p>“You can’t. Against others, maybe. Against that person, your Sacred Gear is useless.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am not weak without my Sacred Gear. I am not leaving you alone. If we leave, we will go together.”</p><p><br></p><p>She wasn’t weak and could even fight Satan Class beings without her Sacred Gears and win but the demon in front of them was beyond normal Satan Class beings and Sacred Gears didn’t work on him.</p><p><br></p><p>“I can leave whenever I want, Lavy. I might not win against them but they cannot stop me if I wanted to leave. You on the other hand don’t have that skill. Please.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oya oya, planning to leave so soon? You didn’t enjoy the reunion, Gretel?” She heard Rizevim speak and her muscles tightened as her magic flowed through her body to react at a moment’s notice.</p><p><br></p><p>It was then that the third party spoke. “We don’t wish for a fight, Rizevim.” The Crimson haired man spoke for the first time, joining the conversation.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, but that’s so boring…. Well if you insist, you can leave with your wife/maid whatever fetish you have and the female version of you….but, these two will need to stay.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Please Rizevim. Let this matter go. This is the human world. A fight here will be catastrophic.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Uyahahahaha a Satan, Lucifer at that is worried about humans? How funny. But no. You see, I have made new friends. The Vampires. An interesting bunch. And these children have been a naughty bunch. They even kidnapped the daughter of the King. Normally I would approve of this behaviour, heart-warmingly evil, just like model devils but I do need to give my friends an explanation. See, they are so worried looking for their princess so they can torture her again.”</p><p><br></p><p>And Gretel did sense the vampires coming to the area. Hundreds of them. The commotion of this scale in their territory might as well have been a declaration of war against them.</p><p><br></p><p>She tried to take Lavinia and teleport but the magic circle was shattered instantly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Now then, don’t be in such a hurry. We met after such a long time. We have a lot of catching up to do.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It doesn’t have to be this way, Rizevim.” The crimson headed man spoke once more.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oya, could it be that you have taken a liking to her too? I mean she does look a lot like dear Grayfia. But that’s a no no. I need her for something. I am afraid I cannot let her leave.”</p><p><br></p><p>The vampires had started approaching them and surrounding the area. The other group sensed this as well and grew tense as the numbers increased.</p><p><br></p><p>Gretel however sensed something else and her body relaxed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are these the attackers?” One of the Vampires who seemed like the head asked. “Where is the monster?”</p><p><br></p><p>“These ones don’t have the monster but they did have another girl. I think she was the bastard of your king. Naughty kids these ones.” Rizevim said, pointing towards her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Take them in.” The Vampire commanded. He was strong. An Ultimate Class being…. but not strong enough.</p><p><br></p><p>Euclid was by this time healed mostly and spoke again, glaring at her directly. “You can take the blonde. She has a Longinus. The other one however will come with us. Apparently someone has forgotten their place and needs to be disciplined.”</p><p><br></p><p>The Vampire looked wide-eyed at the Longinus before staring at Lavinia. “Surround her and take her in. Be careful…” His words however were never completed as every  single one of the vampires suddenly paused before dropping from the air like flies one after another till only one was left.</p><p><br></p><p>A massive whirlpool of clouds formed above the entire forest in the sky. She realised that this time around, the attack was far stronger than what was done in Kyoto.</p><p><br></p><p>The sounds of footsteps were heard and soon a voice accompanied, “I don’t remember giving you permission to discipline <em>my aide</em>, Euclid. Are you perhaps...challenging me?” and out of the fog and snow, appeared the man she had fallen in love with, her Master.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Damien -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>This shit was beyond all the things I had imagined happening.</p><p><br></p><p>I was in a meeting with Azazel and Odin when I heard a transmission from Ophelia about the sudden changes and asked Lavinia to start the mission as well as send Gretel who was the fastest among us to back her up.</p><p><br></p><p>Two parties had caused the mess. One was us and the other… I took a guess and called Rias using our mind’s link and asked her where she was and viola, I knew the identity of the second party.</p><p><br></p><p>The real mess started when I found out about the Old Satan faction’s involvement from Lavinia.</p><p><br></p><p>Odin apparently noticed my tense look when talking about the alliance. We decided to take a small break while Merlin took my place and I left to check the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>The first thing I did was teleport to our base where I found a young Valerie already sleeping and Ophelia’s people taking care of her. Apparently she was teleported here.</p><p><br></p><p>Gretel teleported her here alone?</p><p><br></p><p>Knowing her she would have left with both Valerie and Lavinia without pause unless…</p><p><br></p><p>A thought struck my mind and I quickly raced towards the place where I had sensed the energy signatures.</p><p><br></p><p>Finding them was even easier because of the large number of vampires hovering in the sky.</p><p><br></p><p>I was cloaked under my illusion as I headed towards the place uninterrupted and soon found the reason for Gretel’s decision to stay back.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>One more year would have been good but not all plans go as we want them to go.</p><p><br></p><p>But since the cat’s out of the bag already, let’s do this properly.</p><p><br></p><p>I spread my Observation Haki to its fullest, covering the entire forest and the vampire city beyond it.</p><p><br></p><p>I also heard Euclid’s words and my haki bubbled inside me, roaring to get out and for once…. I didn’t stop it either, only directing it away from certain people from around us and letting it all go.</p><p><br></p><p>The immediate area around me crumbled apart as the massive burst of Conqueror’s Haki was released.</p><p><br></p><p>The Vampires started dropping like flies one after another as I walked towards the place.</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t remember giving you the permission to discipline <em>my aide</em>, Euclid. Are you perhaps… challenging me?”</p><p><br></p><p>I stood in front of Gretel and Lavinia and looked at the people in the area.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs was here too.</p><p><br></p><p>I was kinda surprised that Rias was here too considering how protective he was with her.</p><p><br></p><p>Grayfia… I let out a mental sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>Gretel staying back made a whole lot more sense now.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the remaining Vampire. I left this one to deliver a message for me.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy was on his knees, shivering and rightfully so. I loosened my constant control over my Haki and my Haki was rumbling like a raging tide wanting to rush out. Even now the snow in the area was melting. Even the ice created from magic was slowly crumbling apart from my Haki.</p><p><br></p><p>This was an ice filled with Demonic Power and was harder than most steel.</p><p><br></p><p>“Valerie Tepes has accepted my protection. If your king has any problems with this… he can come here and talk to me. I will stay here for the next two hours. If he doesn’t come in the next two hours though… I will consider him giving up the girl. Go on, relay my message to your King quickly.”</p><p><br></p><p>“W-who… what are you?” He stuttered his question.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am the Devil.”</p><p><br></p><p>___________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: LuluViBritania(FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I was supposed to write more but ending the chapter here seemed more appropriate than ending it somewhere in the middle of the scene.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>A lot of things happened in this chapter and some more will happen later.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I won’t bore you with details for now.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The Devil is finally out in the open.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The world is about to be turned upside down.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br><br></p>",

Obviously I could get angry and feel other emotions too but they couldn't overwhelm me that easily.</p><p><br></p><p>I hadn't gotten the chance to experience it the last time because I was too surprised by the change.</p><p><br></p><p>I just tried to use some light manipulation and it came to me just as easy as breathing.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, I wrapped a cloak around me, enough to cover my face completely.</p><p><br></p><p>The cloak was charmed by Merlin and covered my face from any cameras and would prevent anyone from seeing what's inside.</p><p><br></p><p>The target was right in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>The huge building, guarded by several exorcists and magical enchantments which would make even an Ultimate Class being think twice before trying to attack it.</p><p><br></p><p>The enchantments were done so they would recognize any demonic being entering the place so even if I used my Illusions to sneak in, it would have been useless as the alarm would have gone out anyways.</p><p><br></p><p>The only way to sneak in was to… not sneak in and come through the front door, only disguised.</p><p><br></p><p>I made Sean stay away from the place just in case he was noticed by anyone.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Unnamed Exorcist -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He made his usual night rounds around the church building.</p><p><br></p><p>The days guarding this church were boring. It's not like anything happened here.</p><p><br></p><p>Many others among his brothers/brethren were out there on the front lines, fighting against vampires, devils, monsters from the myths and he…</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, it was safe here. But as a man yearned for that adventure, which he was unlikely to find, simply guarding this place.</p><p><br></p><p>He sighed once more.</p><p><br></p><p>This place was so fortified that even the Devil himself wouldn’t dare to attack it.<br><br></p><p>Just as he thought of this, he felt a presence behind him. Turning back quickly and getting into a defensive position, he saw a cloaked figure walking towards the building.</p><p><br></p><p>When did he…?</p><p><br></p><p>“Sir, please stop. This area is off limits. Who are you? Identify yourself.”</p><p><br></p><p>The figure stopped.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am an angel of the Lord.”</p><p><br></p><p>With those words said, a massive aura of holy power emanated from him as a halo appeared on his head. He was pretty sure he saw a visage of wings behind the cloak.</p><p><br></p><p>Twelve wings.</p><p><br></p><p>Archangel.</p><p><br></p><p>A chill ran down his spine as he quickly kneeled. “My apologies, Sir. We were not informed about your arrival.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s fine. You were just doing your work. Have a good night child.”</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t dare look up.</p><p><br></p><p>Meeting an Archangel. It might not be as exciting as facing the Devil but… it was still something he could brag about.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Damien -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I walked inside the building quite uninterrupted. Just flexing a little bit of my holy aura was enough to get these idiots kneeling down. It was both amusing and disappointing.</p><p><br></p><p>Merlin had already researched the place where the Shroud of Turin was kept as well as the things guarding it.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the Bishop guarding the Shroud left the room when I requested him to. They didn’t even check my face.</p><p><br></p><p>On second thought, it helped that I was here on a day when none of the higher ups were present.</p><p><br></p><p>I was in the room with the shroud. And that’s where things were interesting. The shroud in the glass case in front of me… was a fake.</p><p><br></p><p>I just knew it.</p><p><br></p><p>Even when Merlin’s information said it was the real deal, even when it was radiating Holy Aura,, I… knew it, almost instinctively.</p><p><br></p><p>I just didn’t feel any pull from it. I mean in the case of the Alpheca Tyrant, there was a… a pull too. Nothing like the True Longinus but more like an instinct about it being something related to me. This time however, there was nothing of that sort from the Shroud. I did however feel a pull from the room behind this one. The room that was marked as the Maintenance Room.</p><p><br></p><p>I walked towards it and saw several formations spring up one after another.</p><p><br></p><p>They were good but in front of the Essence of the Archmage and Worthless… not so much.</p><p><br></p><p>Behind the doors, was a maintenance room. Went up to the cupboard and removed it to the side, making a way for the hidden door. Another simple spell later, the door opened and inside was a small white room, with a frame holding a piece of cloth.</p><p><br></p><p>It didn’t have that overwhelming Holy Aura radiating outside but...I knew it. I knew that this was the one.</p><p><br></p><p>I went ahead and more formations sprung up, only to dissolve under the Worthless.</p><p><br></p><p>The frame was separated and I laid my hands on the piece of cloth. The Shroud of Turin.</p><p><br></p><p>The world flashed in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Flashback -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>This time, the room was different. It was still heaven. I had seen this place a few times.</p><p>It was the top most layer of Heaven, the Seventh Heaven.</p><p><br></p><p>I heard some footsteps and turned around to see the familiar figure of the silver haired boy come in. But he was not alone this time. A woman followed him too.</p><p><br></p><p>Silver hair, blue eyes….the only words one could think about when looking at her would be… beautiful. She looked as if she was ethereal. She had the kind of aura that… I… had...</p><p><br></p><p>My train of thought was broken by the voice of Helel.</p><p><br></p><p>“And then, I totally scared Michael…” He was bragging about something which seemed like a prank to me.</p><p><br></p><p>The woman just looked at him with a smile but I could see that she was thinking about something.</p><p><br></p><p>“What are you thinking, Mother?”<br><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>What!</p><p><br></p><p>“Nothing, my son.” She looked as if hesitating for a moment and then she looked at him. “I want to ask you something.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>Then without a warning, her form changed. Her hair turned black, eyes red. The wings on her back shed their feathers and became wings covered in darkness, eerily similar to Devil Wings.</p><p><br></p><p>Her power felt as pure Demonic Energy like my own.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a period of quietness in the place and I watched as the woman looked nervously at the boy. It was until the boy exclaimed.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is so amazing! Can you teach me how to do this?”</p><p><br></p><p>The woman’s eyes widened and she looked nervously at him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Really. You are not afraid of me?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Why would I be afraid of you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Michael seemed to be awfully put off by this.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Eh, Michael’s scared of even his own shadow sometimes. For all his calm and forgiving nature, he is very bad at forming opinions of his own.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Michael is your brother, Helel. Everyone is different. They have different qualities. Michael’s quality is his belief, his obedience. This makes him a great soldier. This has its advantages as well as its disadvantages. Once he doesn’t have anyone to follow, he will be lost. You on the other hand question things, don’t take everything at face value. This is the quality of a King. A King has to question others and question himself to know of the problems and make good decisions. You don’t let yourself depend on the judgments of others and so, you can keep on going despite having no one to follow.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Really? But Father…”</p><p><br></p><p>“These were your Father’s words.”</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha take that Michael. I am the best.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Now Helel, don’t let that make you proud.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Mother.” He gave the woman a quick.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at him with kind motherly eyes. I could see the same look in her eyes Aria used to have for us.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you really not afraid of me, Helel?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Why would I do that?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Because of this power? This darkness? Are you not afraid?”</p><p><br></p><p>“...What’s there to be afraid of, Mother. Light is important, but so is darkness. I mean light gives us our sight to work everyday, becomes our guide… but… at the end of the day, when we are all tired, we take the embrace of darkness to rest our eyes and minds. Without darkness, what importance does light have? and without light, there is no point to darkness either. They are of equal importance… Also, this is you. Why would I be afraid of you?” he then went ahead near her ears and whispered, “Actually, to be honest… it’s a little boring with all this white in Heaven. I think some other colours would do it well.”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at him stunned before hugging him.</p><p><br></p><p>“You really know how to bring light into my life, Helel. You are my Lightbringer.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Lightbringer?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm, you are my Lightbringer. My Lucifer.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Flashback Ends -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I woke up from the daze with the Shroud still in my hands. I could sense some wetness on my face. The scene was bizarre to say the least.</p><p><br></p><p>Lucifer had a mother?</p><p><br></p><p>So, God had a wife?</p><p><br></p><p>Why doesn’t anyone know of her then?</p><p><br></p><p>I couldn’t think of anything and this was not the time to think either.</p><p><br></p><p>I got up, and kept the shroud back in its place.</p><p><br></p><p>Today was weird.</p><p><br></p><p>I left the place quickly, thousands of thoughts running in my head.</p><p><br></p><p>It was outside the church that I encountered another hiccup, this time in the form of what looked like an enderly English gentleman.</p><p><br></p><p>Edward Cristaldi, the wielder of Excalibur.</p><p><br></p><p>“I was informed that an Archangel had descended to inspect the church, without any prior notice. Did you find problems with the place, Sir?” He asked but I could see a look of suspicion in his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“None so far. Do strengthen the wards around the <em>Maintenance Room</em>. They were awfully weak.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said as I walked past the man casually.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will do it, Sir. But, whom should I address this complaint from?”</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>“An Angel of the Lord. Is that not enough for my identity?” I replied but didn’t wait for further reply.</p><p><br></p><p>“It is for me but I am afraid it might not be for others.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then, I am afraid they will have to live without knowing.”</p><p><br></p><p>The next moment, I felt a cold blade on my shoulder. “I insist, Sir. Please identify yourself.”</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>These church idiots really have the audacity.</p><p><br></p><p>I couldn’t help but laugh at this, honestly dumb situation.</p><p><br></p><p>Did he really think <em>this</em> was a good idea?</p><p><br></p><p>I know that things hadn’t been very smooth between the two since the fiasco with Odin but this, wasn’t this trying to hit the hatchet on their own leg?</p><p><br></p><p>I mean I was not even a real Archangel and I was feeling offended.</p><p><br></p><p>Well… since I did take this form, let’s throw in a lesson for this lost lamb.</p><p><br></p><p>I held the tip of his Excalibur Blade between my two fingers.</p><p><br></p><p>“My my. Since when did the little lambs grow so big to judge an Angel?”</p><p><br></p><p>My power soared.</p><p><br></p><p>The Shroud had increased my power as well. If I had to make an estimate, I was around eight and a half times as strong as Serafall. Almost as strong as Rizeim and Sirzechs from what I have heard of them.</p><p><br></p><p>This time however, I didn’t hold back.</p><p><br></p><p>That flashback had made me remember some unpleasant things and now this idiot was pulling a stunt like this. I was quite pissed.</p><p><br></p><p>He tried to pull back the blade quickly but it didn’t budge.</p><p><br></p><p>I had trained my physique to be able to bear my Haki. Even without any Demonic Power, my current Physique would be on par with some named Dragons.</p><p><br></p><p>The holy aura of the blade increased but the Armament Haki on my fingertips was not bypassed by the power of a broken and incomplete sword.</p><p><br></p><p>The area started to tremble as every exorcist ran outside to check up on the clamour.</p><p><br></p><p>The man in question himself had fallen down on his knees and by now was only relying on the aura of the sword to protect himself from my radiating power.</p><p><br></p><p>“Trying to judge an Angel… Do you fancy yourself as God, child?”</p><p><br></p><p>The surroundings were starting to wither away and he was starting to have burns from my holy aura alone.</p><p><br></p><p>Realising, I had sent the message, I left the sword and the man fell to his knees gasping for breath. “I found out that the church was becoming corrupted. Playing with the lives of innocent children, experimenting on them, all in the name of God. I thought it was only a select few who were so… but now… I will rethink everything. Do not for a single moment think that your sins will be overlooked just because you are from the church. If the Vatican follows the path of Sodom and Gomorrah… it shall meet the same end as well.”</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t wait for them to recover and teleported from the place as fast as I could.</p><p><br></p><p>This will surely be spread like wildfire.</p><p><br></p><p>Poor Sean.</p><p><br></p><p>________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>I returned back to Kyoto a few hours after the incident.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t tell anyone about this.</p><p><br></p><p>On second thought, this act,while done impulsively, can be used quite well.</p><p><br></p><p>If nothing else, it will keep the three factions busy for a while.</p><p><br></p><p>The church had been getting jumpy.</p><p><br></p><p>Hopefully it will keep them reigned in for some time.</p><p><br></p><p>“Boss, why did you do that? Now, the Boss Lady and the little Midget will tear me apart.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at him who was just a small distance away from the place when I had released my energy, ready with the True Longinus out to assist me at a moment’s notice.</p><p><br></p><p>He acted like a goofball but was always ready to assist us. This guy cared about the team a lot.</p><p><br></p><p>I guess it was time.</p><p><br></p><p>Sean had got his Binder’s Mark previously.</p><p><br></p><p>I need to collect some more  marks for Valerie and Gasper.</p><p><br></p><p>There were several changes in me due to the Shroud.</p><p><br></p><p>Was the Shroud of Turin different somehow?</p><p><br></p><p>It was the only one of the Holy Relics that was not made into a Sacred Gear. Why?</p><p><br></p><p>I shook my head for now. The changes will be addressed later. My Observation Haki sensed something interesting going on near the main battlefield.</p><p><br></p><p>It looks like things are picking up pace.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Merlin -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Merlin looked at the kids fighting against the Ayakashi forces.</p><p><br></p><p>They were doing things quite admirably.</p><p><br></p><p>He was mainly here to keep any devils from interfering in the fights as well as keep an eye on the kids.</p><p><br></p><p>Another thing was to keep the little miss in front of him from realising what his little brother was up to.</p><p><br></p><p>Damien Lucifer… Asmodeus.</p><p><br></p><p>In his previous incarnations, Merlin would have scoffed at the idea of him joining forces with a Devil, let alone ‘The Devil’. And yet, here he was… with someone carrying the Asmodeus blood as well.</p><p><br></p><p>The flashes of the future he had seen were enough to convince him that despite his prejudice, this was the best path that this world could take in general.</p><p><br></p><p>Thus he chose his new King and fair to say that he wasn’t disappointed in the least.</p><p><br></p><p>The gift of his new powers alone would have had a man of knowledge like him sold in the first place but Damien Lucifer… Merlin saw him as a person who could change the world. And when he did so, he wanted to be standing beside him.</p><p><br></p><p>He watched as the kids held back the commanders of Nue but were just short of preventing the revival. The Phenex Tears with the commanders was one of the reasons behind it.</p><p><br></p><p>Nue arose from Yomi.</p><p><br></p><p>“Should we intervene, Merlin?” He heard Gretel’s voice.</p><p><br></p><p>“No. Kuroka is there. If we show ourselves, there is a chance that Nue might change his plans.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So, what did I miss?” They both heard a voice from the back.</p><p><br></p><p>Turning around, they saw Damien coming in followed by Sean. he looked at the nervous look on Sean’s face and realised that something might have happened.</p><p><br></p><p>He still decided not to bring things up.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nue has just been reincarnated. Not a perfect reincarnation but still enough. Kuroka gave the children some chances to fight. They did but the difference in experience, alas, they are still too young and don’t train often enough.”</p><p><br></p><p>They waited and looked at the scene in front of them.</p><p><br></p><p>Nue had attacked a part of the town and would have laid waste to the place if not for Kuroka redirecting his attack upwards.</p><p><br></p><p>He saw Sean whistling, “The wild kitten has gotten really good. This Senjutsu thing seems to be very great, Boss.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It is. You should try learning. I mean, you could try the one that combines with Chakra.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh! Is it the sage mode thing you had talked about? It had been quite interesting along with that Yin-Yang Release stuff. If the current research in Magecraft wasn’t keeping me busy, I would have even tried to work on that but alas, even with my current power, I can only make and maintain five hundred clones at best and Reality Marbles are endless ditches that keep taking more and more research.” The Archmage was beyond anything he could have imagined. It just opened too many paths for him and he wouldn’t be his own self, if he left those paths unattended.</p><p><br></p><p>“I… will probably give some more time to my Haki first. My lessons with Runes have been quite helpful but I don’t think I can take much more than this at the moment.” Sean raised his hands. In this matter, Sean was always quite aware of his limits and never took on jobs he couldn’t handle. It was an admirable quality for a person to have. “By the way, Boss. Who is that girl you asked for Rossweisse?”</p><p><br></p><p>Oh! Now this was news. He looked at Damien who was still watching the fight.</p><p><br></p><p>“She is someone with great magical talent. I dare say, she could even rival Merlin if guided properly. She has a bit of an inferiority complex due to not inheriting her family Magic. Due to this, she was always sidelined by many except her grandmother. She took refuge in books and that’s where her talents lay. I want her to be a part of my team. Did you meet her by any chance in Valhalla?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. She is being personally coached by Lady Brynhildr about the Norse Magic.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sean came in and whispered into his ears. “And she looks a lot like the Boss Lady, except with blue eyes.”</p><p><br></p><p>Oh! That is quite interesting.</p><p><br></p><p>“Looks like things are about to end there.” Damien said as he watched Kuroka facing Hagoromo Gitsune, only for Nue to attack them both together.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka due to her superior senses and skill in both Senjutsu and Haki was able to dodge. The other… was not so lucky.</p><p><br></p><p>Nue didn’t show any sign of remorse either.</p><p><br></p><p>“Looks like the deal is already done, my King. Should we intervene?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. Did you analyse the method used by Nue to break his limits?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I did. It was a ritual of sacrifice to create a better vessel to suit his strengthened soul when he reincarnated. Abe no Seimei was originally half human and that limited his potential quite a lot. His ritual however used his human side to be completely changed into an Ayakashi. The sacrifices didn’t actually create a body but rather strengthened his soul. The Fear that they had been collecting around all this while was then used as a medium to manifest a body inside his mother’s womb. The new body will be of greater power as it will be made according to his now stronger soul. I have to say that it was quite a well thought and brilliant plan. Too bad, the kids ruined the supply of fear and he couldn’t manifest completely. He will gain strength over time and might rival the likes of a sage with his new potential when he is complete, even more if he trains himself.”</p><p><br></p><p>“He is still a Kitsune, right?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. Kitsune Ayakashi.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Alright. That’s what I needed to hear. We take him in alive. Hagoromo Gitsune is already with us now, so let’s clear this mess.”</p><p><br></p><p>Merlin watched in fascination as an overwhelming pressure fell on the entire area. The Conqueror’s Haki.</p><p><br></p><p>A vortex of clouds formed in the sky.</p><p><br></p><p>He had mastered this technique too, although he was nowhere near this level of expertise. Weaponizing someone’s will was a thought that hadn’t even stuck him before he was introduced to Haki.</p><p><br></p><p>The entire opposing army except for Nue and Hagoromo Gitsune collapsed in the very next moment.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Damien -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Kuroka, Akira. Take the top brass prisoners. Seal Nue but don’t attack Hagoromo Gitsune.” I spoke through my Binder’s Link.</p><p><br></p><p>With my stronger soul, my Conqueror’s Haki was probably the Skill that was strengthened the most. I could get a much better control of the skill with much less effort.</p><p><br></p><p>“This Conqueror’s Haki is such a cheat. I kinda feel sorry for those people. They couldn’t even get a warrior’s end.”</p><p><br></p><p>“They didn’t get a warrior’s end because they were not warriors in the first place. A warrior wouldn’t have collapsed from just that. Conqueror’s Haki attacks the spirit and I wasn’t even focusing on them. They didn’t have the heart of a warrior.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t think you realise that your current attack would have crushed even Ultimate Class beings. The weaker ones are probably in a comatose state already.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked down and yes, some of them did look like they were comatose.</p><p><br></p><p>“Remind me to train our armies to resist Haki. Withstanding this pressure <em>is</em> a good way to strengthen one’s spirit.”</p><p><br></p><p>Nue tried to oppose but under the attacks of both Akira and Kuroka, he was taken down in moments because he was not even at full strength. Although he had enormous experience, he was ultimately just reincarnated and that too not completely. And on top of that, the Haki must have disoriented him.</p><p><br></p><p>Akira was stronger than Kuroka in terms of raw power while Kuroka was more about skill at this point. It was due to the increased training that Akira had had inside the Innovate Clear. He was using a disguise in case there were any spies from any factions watching this scene. Him being my subordinate was kept hidden for now to avoid some trouble.</p><p><br></p><p>With everything done, I went to meet with Yasaka and Nurarihyon.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>– Yasaka –</strong></p><p><br></p><p>\"Just what in hell happened there?\" She heard Magari's quivering voice as she looked at the massive vortex covering the skies of Kyoto. One moment, it looked like Nue was going to attack and the very next moment, everything was over. He was on his knees, holding and screaming his brains off while the status of his entire army was unknown.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s the Boss. He took action personally.” One of Akira’s clones answered their doubts.</p><p><br></p><p>“A type of Mental Attack of sorts?” She didn’t sense anything.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s Haki. Something we were taught. Although, this particular  type of Haki is rare. According to the Boss, only one in a million can awaken this. It’s a type of Spiritual Attack. Haki in the loosest of terms is just as it sounds, Willpower. The User exerts their will power over others and subdues them. Sometimes they can even use it on the world, to cause this kind of phenomenon. It simply surpasses the normal barriers and is nigh impossible to defend against. As the Boss says, ‘Numbers don’t matter against Kings.’”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are there other types of Haki?” She asked, not taking her eyes off the scene.</p><p><br></p><p>“There are but I am not permitted to say what those are or what they can do. My apologies.”</p><p><br></p><p>She then watched as both Kuroka and the real Akira fought Nue. The fight was a bit lacklustre as they had just overpowered Nue with brute force.</p><p><br></p><p>She did notice something off about it.</p><p><br></p><p>“Akira seems to be well-versed in Senjutsu, especially the sensing part. It looks as if he is dodging Nue’s attacks which is quite astonishing as Nue himself is extremely versed in Senjutsu and his attacks are hard to detect even for us.”</p><p><br></p><p>“He is not using Senjutsu.” The clone replied, without going on any further. She understood that she wouldn’t get anything out of it and didn’t ask further.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally Kuroka did something </p><p><br></p><p>Surprisingly, none of them touched Hagoromo Gitsune and neither did she retaliate. She seemed to still be in shock from the betrayal.</p><p><br></p><p>Inside, Yasaka felt a hint of vindictive pleasure at seeing that look on the other Nine Tailed Fox’s face for the betrayal she had to face because of her people, because of him. But somewhere, she did feel a good amount of pity for the mother, being betrayed by her child. She guessed that Karma was a thing.</p><p><br></p><p>“You all should send people to take in the unconscious Ayakashi and Youkai. Some of them might gain consciousness soon.”</p><p><br></p><p>She did just that. She could always discuss the new systems of magic with their Boss later on.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Damien -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The entire fiasco of the Youkai was resolved in a few days after their leaders were captured.</p><p><br></p><p>Merlin took Nue to extract information from him.</p><p><br></p><p>Hagoromo Gitsune asked for permission to give birth to her child again but this time without any memories so that she can help him out once more.</p><p><br></p><p>This woman.</p><p><br></p><p>Even after being betrayed by her child, she was still trying to protect his life.</p><p><br></p><p>We agreed on the condition that he willingly gives up his power to her. All she asked was for the contract to be made.</p><p><br></p><p>She was already brokered into loyalty to me. I didn’t have any reason to fear her rebelling.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t know what she did but she got the contract signed. We never saw Nue’s body but she confirmed that he would never bother us again.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy, crazy he might have become was an inevitable genius is magic. Someone that even Merlin accepted was not less than the normal or rather previous him.</p><p><br></p><p>He had extracted all of Nue’s knowledge and boy was it a lot.</p><p><br></p><p>He had single handedly developed the Onmyoji Style to the level of an art.</p><p><br></p><p>Abe no Seimei was called the father of Onmyojutsu in Japan. Before him, the only Onmyoji clans were those associated with the Shinto, namely the five principal clans and some other loose Onmyojis. He devised an entire system of magic to be taught to people with any affinity with Spiritual Magic.</p><p><br></p><p>The knowledge we extracted was shared with the Himejima Clan under Suzaku and among my subordinates too.</p><p><br></p><p>Tsubaki was progressing extremely well with the added techniques. Akeno on the other hand was concentrating on the Purifying Flames and Holy Lightning.</p><p><br></p><p>With the added power from Nue, Hagoromo Gitsune was far stronger now than before, her power rivalling the likes of Serafall easily and I added a Negative Fruit on top of that, getting ourselves another beyond Satan Class member for our team.</p><p><br></p><p>The incident and betrayal of her people had left a massive effect on her confidence. At least a saving grace was that around fifteen of her subordinates were still loyal to her and followed us.</p><p><br></p><p>They signed a contract as well to avoid any problems later on.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are these all?” I asked, looking at the people in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. For now. I got the non devil prisoners from the dungeon first. Are you going to tell me what you want to do?” Merlin asked, looking at the gathered group. Fallen Angels, Youkai, Ayakashi and even some Vampires.</p><p><br></p><p>“I might have figured out what my power is as a Lucifer.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, what?”</p><p><br></p><p>“According to Razevan, it is always something related to the myth of Lucifer. Although I don’t think he is particularly on point about the thing, it did give me a hint. Considering that I am a soul reincarnation of Lucifer or something, this thing did apply to me. Now, tell me, what was Lucifer most famous for?”</p><p><br></p><p>“There were many things. Most famous would be… The creation of the Devil Race?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Technically yes. Do you know how he did that?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I think it was both his and Lilith’s joint effort.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, here’s a clue.” I walked over to the first Fallen Angel. He was someone even Azazel had rejected to bring into Grigori. A Fallen Angel completely fallen into depravity, no pun intended.</p><p><br></p><p>I had most of my soul repaired and thus merged with Lucifer’s soul. It also awakened the power of the Lucifer Clan when I touched the last one, the Shroud of Turin.</p><p><br></p><p>I concentrated on the feeling, got the image in mind and let my Demonic Power do the rest of the work.</p><p><br></p><p>The feathers on the Fallen Angel’s wings fell off as it turned into a black wing like a bat’s.</p><p><br></p><p>Demonification.</p><p><br></p><p>“Lucifer was the first being to reincarnate into a Devil. Lilith was the first reincarnated Devil. He later changed the other Satans into Devils too. If he could, there should be no reason why I couldn’t do the same.”</p><p><br></p><p>I saw the stunned look on Merlin’s face after which he quickly ran some tests on the subjects. “I will observe them for a while.” He said when he completed the tests.</p><p><br></p><p>I went on changing the other races into Devils as well.</p><p><br></p><p>“Check if they retained their original powers. All the mutations and changes in their personalities. I don’t want to use this on any of my subordinates unless we are completely sure of all the side effects.”</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded and got to work once more.</p><p><br></p><p>If there is something I have learned about Merlin, it’s that he can get completely lost in work.</p><p><br></p><p>In these last few days, almost all of my main subordinates got marked.</p><p><br></p><p>The Youkai were collecting themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>The children had progressed but they were still far behind real monsters of the world.</p><p><br></p><p>I had another meeting with them after the war ended.</p><p><br></p><p>Some things were decided.</p><p><br></p><p>Yasaka wanted to trade for the methods to use Haki for Youkai specific skills for Akira or any other subordinate we might have.</p><p><br></p><p>Surprisingly, Nurarihyon requested the same in return for their techniques.</p><p><br></p><p>Apparently, my show of the Conqueror’s Haki had shaken them as well as the entire Youkai faction watching the scenes. I didn’t know about any spies but I am pretty sure, anyone doing so would have reported this to their factions as well. I am pretty sure that there were several spies from the Devils keeping an eye on the scene. It was just something any sane faction would do.</p><p><br></p><p>The negotiations were fairly simple. I promised to train a few of their best in return for them doing the same for some of my own. They won’t be able to teach everyone my techniques that easily because most of them required the assistance of the Archmage Essence. While they can be recreated, it would be immensely hard.</p><p><br></p><p>I did get them to negotiate with the current government to send some of their people back while <em>publicly</em> executing several of them. The Naberius and the Nebiros being among them.</p><p><br></p><p>The executions will take place in a week while the ones being sent back included the two King Piece users that were captured.</p><p><br></p><p>They were already made to sign the contracts. Surprisingly, they gave up very fast. All I needed to do was disable their King Pieces temporarily and both of the main fighters were crying babies in no time. They weren’t even proficient in their own power, just brute forcing things with the power of the King Piece. It was honestly annoying to watch them waste that much power.</p><p><br></p><p>There were six or seven people among the top ten Rating Games players who were using the King Pieces.</p><p><br></p><p>Diehauser had been waiting for the signal. As soon as he got it, both he and Cleria ambushed three other King Piece users.</p><p><br></p><p>They got the same treatment as well. We now had five King Piece users as spies, just waiting for action.</p><p><br></p><p>The best part was the billions we got for the ones we <em>returned</em> as compensation for the damages they had caused. Those idiots were among the Top Ten Rating Game Players and as funny as it sounds, among the strongest forces of the Devil Race, right behind the Satans and their peerages. Sending them back was something Yasaka especially didn’t want to do and the only reason she did so was on my request. In the negotiations with Serafall though, she made the Devils bleed for taking them back.</p><p><br></p><p>Two dozen Phenex Tears for each person. Forty Eight Phenex Tears is something that the entire Phenex Clan produced in a year or so. The other peerage members were released for money. It probably emptied a lot of the money they had earned from the fixed Rating Games, not that it matters. The five were going to go bankrupt anyway.</p><p><br></p><p>Serafall obviously wanted to get the others too but was rejected.</p><p><br></p><p>This time, Serafall’s attitude was much better than the last time.</p><p><br></p><p>As expected, several other factions found out about the <em>Unnatural Phenomenon</em> that ended the war. It was guessed that the Youkai had a trump card or someone extremely strong backing them up. </p><p><br></p><p>Everyone was tense but none of the Youkai leaders made any statements. Even the Shinto hadn’t asked for any statements ‘because this was the Youkai’s matter’ as Nurarihyon had <em>kindly</em> reminded them when they tried to take a feel of the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>The Three Factions on the other hand were already tense because of the appearance of a so-called ‘Super Archangel’ all of a sudden and Michael had no idea what was happening.</p><p><br></p><p>The funny thing was that, although he didn’t know anything, he still kept quiet and didn’t downright deny the statement.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Angels were doing politics now.</p><p><br></p><p>Add this on top of what happened in Kyoto and the Devils side was much tamer than normal due to the sudden arrival of two insanely strong unknowns.</p><p><br></p><p>Azazel called me instead to ask if I had anything to do with the Youkai mess. He had doubts about my involvement with the Youkai because of Kuroka and I confirmed it, finally making the man calmer.</p><p><br></p><p>Some people decided to sit on the fence and wait for some idiot to poke the nest and see if the beast came out.</p><p><br></p><p>I returned to my room and saw Gretel cleaning.</p><p><br></p><p>She never allowed anyone else to take care of this room.</p><p><br></p><p>I spread my Observation Haki around the area to confirm no one was around us and walked in. She noticed me and nodded before continuing her work.</p><p><br></p><p>Gretel was opening up in the last few months. Especially the relationship between us.</p><p><br></p><p>I walked behind her and hugged her, resting my chin on her shoulder.</p><p><br></p><p>“Master!” She yelped, her face growing red to her ears.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes.” I replied nonchalantly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Someone will come in.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Let them. Do you think I am afraid of anyone knowing about us?”</p><p><br></p><p>Her blush deepened and I hugged her closer before turning her towards me.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are a little miffed with me, right?” I asked. She found out about the Super angel thing and had looked at me first thing. I pretended to not know anything but it’s better to clear things out than to keep her worrying unnecessary.</p><p><br></p><p>“I-I no. I am… I am just… worried.” She looked down, not meeting my eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>I cupped her face in my hands and made her look up towards me.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are important to me, Gretel. I… I love you.” Her eyes widened as she looked at me directly into the eyes. “What? Did you think I would do this to just anyone? We both have had… An unusual childhood with each other being the main people we relied on. I was afraid that me approaching you would force you to accept and reciprocate my feelings and I don’t want that. I would never force you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You aren’t…”</p><p><br></p><p>“I know. I know this now.” I paused before collecting myself and speaking again “These feelings… I struggle to handle them sometimes. I am trying to get better but sometimes I… I am broken, Gretel. So, if I do something wrong, please tell me directly. If not in front of others, then privately. In relationships like these, we give our partners some power over us as a sign of trust. I want you to use that power. Understood?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I… you are not broken, Master. I am. I am… dirty.” She looked down and suddenly my urge to kill Euclid in the bloodiest of ways ignited again. Although no lines were crossed, the abuse she endured left a mental scar and a massive inferiority complex in her, which can only get better with time and nothing else.</p><p><br></p><p>“Gretel! Look at me.” I raised her face to look into her eyes again. “You are not dirty. I forbid you from saying that again. You are my Gretel and I won’t let anyone insult you… Not even you yourself. Understood?”</p><p><br></p><p>Her eyes teared up lightly as she nodded. I wiped her eyes with my fingers, our faces close to each other. I leaned in as she closed her eyes in waiting.</p><p><br></p><p>The door slammed open. “Dummy!”</p><p><br></p><p>We got back quickly, Gretel becoming quite flustered.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the little gremlin who had stopped my first kiss with Gretel although accidently.</p><p><br></p><p>The said gremlin however was narrowing her eyes as she looked at us. “What were you two doing?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I was looking into her eyes.” I blurted.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hah?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm, Master was looking into my eyes to see if there was any dust in it. I got some when cleaning the room.” Gretel said.</p><p><br></p><p>Good save.</p><p><br></p><p>“Really?”</p><p><br></p><p>“What else would we be doing?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“N… nothing. They were calling you. Merlin made that Reality Marble thingy. We were going to test and see how it works.”</p><p><br></p><p>Fucking Merlin.</p><p><br></p><p>I saw Gretel’s eyes twitch slightly. Merlin was in for a bad day. Not that I cared this time.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh. This one was rather fast. Sure, I will be there in a minute. By the way Vi, I need you to do something for me. Can you go to the labs and call for Helena and Cleria? They will need to be present for this one too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, okay. By the way, the location is the eighth training ground.”</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded as she left the room quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>A moment later, Gretel looked at me and then walked towards the door and I followed her, only to pull her back into my arms and capture her lips while my other hand closed the door behind us.</p><p><br></p><p>Her lips were soft and after a few moments of surprise, she melted into my arms and moved her lips to reciprocate.</p><p><br></p><p>Her hands wrapped around my neck and mine around her waist pulling each other more into the kiss.</p><p><br></p><p>We broke our kiss after a minute and looked into each other’s eyes. No words were said as we communicated with our eyes and in the next moment, jumped in for another one.</p><p><br></p><p>As if I would let our intimate moment get ruined by anyone.</p><p><br></p><p>I am ‘The Devil’. I don’t get blue balled.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Vienna -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Vienna walked quickly towards the lab, her speed only sort of running.</p><p><br></p><p>They were about to kiss.</p><p><br></p><p>Gretel and Dummy were about to kiss… and she accidentally interrupted them.</p><p><br></p><p>Damn, Merlin.</p><p><br></p><p>Couldn’t he make that whatsitsname at a later date.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone was rooting for the two to get together and she almost blew it up.</p><p><br></p><p>Good thing, Dummy was not a coward like those dumb anime protagonists.</p><p><br></p><p>Oh, yes. If he wanted to hide then he should have waited till they were out of her Observation Haki’s range.</p><p><br></p><p>She was happy for them.</p><p><br></p><p>Now all she needed to do was go and collect her winnings from the betting pool. She and Charlene had won the bet about when they would get together and have their first kiss.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Michael -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“This was all, Sir. I couldn’t see his face and he didn’t give any name either. I apologise for my rude behaviour.”</p><p><br></p><p>Michael looked at the man kneeling in front of him, eyes to the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you see how many wings he had?” Raphael asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I didn’t see any wings either, Sir. I was called when the guard had informed me that an Archangel had arrived and was going to see the Shroud. I knew that none of the Archangels had descended because I just had a meeting with Lord Ariel so I headed there. The guard had seen the shadow of twelve wings and a halo above his head. And his power…”</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. The Power.</p><p><br></p><p>The amount of holy energy was so high that it could still be felt in the land after an entire week. And this was just from him flaring his aura. Such power… Michael could only remember one being but…</p><p><br></p><p>\"Did he say anything before leaving?\" Michael asked.</p><p><br></p><p>\"He…\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Don't be afraid. Speak up. You were just doing your duty. We don't blame you for anything.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Thank you, Sir. He said that the church should not think themselves above justice and… and if the Vatican follows the path of Sodom and Gomorrah, it shall meet the same end. He was mentioning the experiments, the Siegfried Project, I think.\"</p><p><br></p><p>… </p><p><br></p><p>… </p><p><br></p><p>\"Thank you for your report, Edward. You may return to your position again.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Thank you, Lord Michael.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing him leave, Michael turned towards his siblings. \"What do you all think of this? Do you really think any of our brothers had survived in the Great War and refused to return like Metatron?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"It could be… but their power doesn't make sense. If we had someone like this on our side during the Great War… things would have been very different.\" Uriel said.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Strength can be increased through training. If someone trained all this time, achieving this level of strength… is not impossible. The question is, why now?\" Raphael asked.</p><p><br></p><p>\"This exorcist was hiding something. Did the person do anything suspicious to the Shroud?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"He… walked up to the shroud, took it and then… he fell to his knees and shed tears. He got up after a few moments and put the Shroud back and left without any words. The only reason he even stopped was because Edward interrupted him or he would have left without any words.” Michael reported.</p><p><br></p><p>The atmosphere grew quiet for a while and Michael voiced out a thought.</p><p><br></p><p>“If such a person were to return back and take charge of the System… things would have improved a lot.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Michael, you can’t be…” Uriel started but was stopped by Raphael.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why would it matter, Uriel? Didn’t you sense the Holy power in the area? He was without a doubt a brother of ours. Someone who came out because of our incompetence. He came out because nowadays children are being killed in the name of our Father while we do nothing and sit here in fear to maintain a hoax. Had Father been alive, he would have…”</p><p><br></p><p>Raphael left the words alone but he didn’t need to say anymore.</p><p><br></p><p>All of them present here knew of the answer already.</p><p><br></p><p>“Finally, thinking things through,” Michael ordered. “Raphael, send an investigation to all the facilities of the Church and have them checked. If you find anything illegal, suspend the research and have the ones in-charge tried. Azazel and Sirzechs have called for a meeting. Gabriel has gone to meet Serafall and is keeping her busy. Everyone has been shaken due to the appearance of this Archangel. I need to make a statement. The only reason I could keep this up was because of the things going on in the Youkai Faction. There have been a lot of rumours coming from Kyoto and the Devils are busy cleaning up the mess. I cannot keep this up any longer. If this brother of ours is unsatisfied with us, then let’s work to make Heaven better and hope he returns back.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Serafall -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>They watched the video once more and then sat back in silence.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure there was no tampering with the video?” Falbium asked for the umpeenth time.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I checked the ones involved in the incident myself. There was another Eight Tailed Kitsune who is also suspected to be a sage and was working closely with Kuroka. They were both at least beyond normal Ultimate Class beings. I questioned the prisoners and found out that it was mainly the Kitsune who captured their entire peerages all by himself.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"How do we not know of such a Youkai? Even Yasaka herself would be in danger against them and their entire peerages.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"He is a sage.\" She replied quite curtly.</p><p><br></p><p>Sages are known to be able to use Nature Energy to use strengths beyond their own.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Are sages so easy to come across? Two of them came out of nowhere. Add them with the existing forces of the Youkai and they are becoming a decently strong faction.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"They are, and that's not mentioning whatever it was that happened during the war recently causing the rebels to lose instantly. Is it another person or did Yasaka use the Leylines? You said that the Nekoshou had said that only the children were fighting and that none of the adults had made any moves. There were over a thousand Youkai and Ayakashi being subdued almost instantly, even Ultimate Class beings like Nue weren’t able to escape and yet….none of the allies were hurt.. Do you think they have someone else that we don’t know about? Maybe….”</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t know, Falbium. Although, I don’t think it could have been Yasaka. The fight was at the castle where the node of the Leylines were. Moreover, Yasaka was poisoned the last time I met her and wasn’t in any condition to fight. She was sitting in front of me due to sheer willpower and hatred because someone from the Devil’s side had kidnapped her child.”</p><p><br></p><p>“On that matter, what is the situation with the captured Devils?” Ajuka looked towards Sirzechs as it was his job to take care of the matters on this end.</p><p><br></p><p>“Several of the houses are ready to revolt at the mere mention of sentencing them. There are many who want to attack the Youkai and get the others back, including the Nabiros Head whose son is about to be executed.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Mostly related to the ones who were punished the last time, I guess. They were informed about the treaty and expressly forbidden from doing just this and yet….”</p><p><br></p><p>“Some of them said that since I said that they could fight this fight on their own, they did just that. They attacked the Youkai on their own.” Sirzechs held his head.</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“If that’s the case, then they can save their people on their own too. No need to say anything in these matters. The attackers will forever be banned from any Rating Games. The compensation we had to pay will all be deducted from their properties. If they refuse to pay, remove the rights of anyone from their houses to participate in the Rating Games. There is an unknown Archangel with powers comparable to our own or maybe even surpassing us like their father out there. We have neither the time nor patience to deal with this.” Ajuka said, looking annoyed. It was very rare of him to show his annoyance but she understood his feelings well.</p><p><br></p><p>It was the Archangel.</p><p><br></p><p>This time, they hadn’t needed any spies to know about this matter. The entirety of the country and even some neighbouring ones had felt that aura. The area was saturated with Holy Power for over a week.</p><p><br></p><p>“I think it’s exactly because of this that they are pushing us more. The Great King faction thinks that they can get away with this because we don’t know of the Archangel and are busy worrying about him. We cannot focus on any of the internal matters with such an emergency. They don’t understand what could happen if someone of that strength decided to take action. Normal Ultimate Class Devils wouldn’t even be able to stand in its presence alone. But that’s not even the worst part. The System of Heaven will be far more effective and the Angels will be able to act more freely. Do you think Michael was hiding this trump card?” Falbium said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Not really. It wouldn’t have made any sense. The Angels have been in a very dire situation and if they had someone like this, they would have brought him out beforehand if for nothing than to keep us and the Fallen in check. Even the matter with Odin and the church would have been handled much better. I think it might be one of those who had left after their father had passed away. Michael would be just as surprised as us but still, get a meeting with him. But before anything, we need to settle this matter inside our own faction. Things would become extremely messy if they attacked the youkai during the execution.”</p><p><br></p><p>Serafall had to agree too. “The Great King faction has been too much of a pain lately. We need to find a way to restrain them. This time, we just don’t have the leeway to go out and pressure out the other factions with our power. Has Zekram made any moves?”</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs just shook his head. “He’s quiet. Probably looking for an opportunity for us to mess up and make us owe one to him. These types of waiting games are his forte.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We could always get some other houses to support us. I think your father was planning to engage your sister to the Phenex boy. “ Ajuka commented only for Sirzechs to wince.</p><p><br></p><p>“She didn’t want it, did she?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Riser has….a very strong personality.” Sirzechs started to speak only for her to roll her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“He’s a jerk. We know. No need to mince your words in this room, Sirzechs. So, what happened, Rias threw a tantrum?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Throwing a tantrum would have been better. When father had revealed about the contract, she had downright denied it. She said that she will challenge him to a Rating Game. Riser didn’t make it better and just mocked her and her peerage instead. He said some offensive things about Akame and while father and Lord Phenex blew it off as children’s fight it was anything but. Now, she is downright murderous. She has increased her training.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Is this still about <em>that</em> person? She’s still hung over the Lucifer boy?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It is. Father was worried about her crushing on the guy and thus pushed the engagement talks faster. He thinks that Riser would help her forget about that guy but it had the opposite effect instead. Father and Rias are both stubborn and are not backing out. Now, I rarely see her. She’s either in her lessons, training or visiting the Paimons for the treatment of her Queen.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Is Akame-chan doing fine?”</p><p><br></p><p>“She is. She trains all day with Rias and is progressing quite well. Apparently, Ophelia Paimon has a Youkai well versed in Senjutsu in her peerage and is offering her advice with her training. Beowulf has met the person and he seemed amicable enough.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The Paimons have a very good network. Especially now with their rapidly spreading medicine Industry. Many small factions trade with them and they were one of the houses who were affected the most when this debacle with the Youkai happened. They have stayed out of this entire mess while trying to soothe their contracts. Ophelia has managed the situation quite well. They are also not really a part of the Great King faction, being one of the last houses to change sides during the Civil War, only after the previous Lord Paimon died. Ophilia has managed her house quite well in this cesspool and she is currently very close with the Salos and even the younger Dantalion sister. I think she is close to your sister as well, Falbium.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well….she is. Charlene and Ophelia Paimon get along quite well.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We can try approaching her to support our side.” She suggested.</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t know. The only way Ophelia has managed to keep herself out of all this is by ardently avoiding politics all together. She has mainly kept the members of other extinct or bankrupt devil houses among her employees to avoid getting influenced by any other houses. She is a pure businesswoman.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And she is also someone who is being inconvenienced by this entire matter. Not to mention, there have been some undercurrents of others eying her growing businesses. We don’t need her to become a politician, just a good enough businesswoman. If we could get some control over the economy of the Underworld out of the Great King faction’s hands, we will get a lot more breathing room. Ophelia is looking to expand into other fields but is worried about others. All we need to do is support her and we can not only gain her goodwill but also help weaken the Great King faction somewhat.”</p><p><br></p><p>“….we can try but we need to clear our internal matters first. A super strong Archangel and a Lucifer look alike appearing at the same time, is this the prelude to another Great War?”</p><p><br></p><p>__________________________________x_____________________________________________________________________x___________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: LuluViBritania(FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>This chapter marks the end of the Kyoto Youkai arc.

The one those kids are fighting now is a weakened version. I know of some stories that speak of him as a complete battle maniac that would pick a fight even at the cost of his own life.” Akira replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“Six arms? He has only four right now and is still quite strong.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I think I remember the stories about him fighting Nue. Although he lost, he survived. He always survives.”</p><p><br></p><p>Akira and I were watching the fight between Rikuo and his followers against Tsuchigumo, the Spider Youkai who was a beast of Youkai at Ultimate Class in physique. The guy’s resilience was something worth watching.</p><p><br></p><p>“He’s weak nyaa~” Kuroka yawned at my side.</p><p><br></p><p>“For us maybe. But for normal Youkai, he might as well be invincible. At his full strength though, it will be strong enough to fight Ultimate Class beings equally. He can also regrow his arms after resting if I remember correctly, so you might be able to see his full strength someday.” Akira commented very casually, making her pout.</p><p><br></p><p>Regrow?</p><p><br></p><p>“Regrow, not heal?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes nyaa~ Magari-sensei told me about it. He can regrow his arms after regaining enough fear. He does so by burying himself in the earth. There is also the fact that his regeneration and vitality are insane. He can even survive being almost chopped into pieces.”</p><p><br></p><p>Hmm, that’s interesting. Healing is something. Phenex Regeneration is something I have been observing in the Rating Game videos but need to observe in real time to get a real idea about what it’s like. But even that is just healing with Demonic Power, not true regrowth. I wonder if I can make use of this? </p><p><br></p><p>The fight picked up and Rikuo who seemed to have learned to merge his fear with others was first able to freeze one arm of Tuchigumo while another one of his tries was unsuccessful due to the interference of other youkai. Although the second attack of his if successful would have reached the Ultimate Class level. That’s quite a lot of progress.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oops, the kids are in trouble. Kuroka, open an exit route for them. Akira, would you like to play? Just try not to kill him. I would like to observe the regeneration of this guy.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I’ll pass.” The Kitsune answered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure.” Kuroka on the other hand was excited at the prospect of showing me her progress.</p><p><br></p><p>The Nekoshou went ahead. Kuroka created a poisonous mist, melting the Youkai blocking her way as she casually walked to the middle of the shrine while Akira just waited in the shadows until Kuroka was done finishing the backup mission.</p><p><br></p><p>Tsuchigumo however didn’t want his prey to run away and chased, directly in the direction of Kuroka who was covering for the Youkai.</p><p><br></p><p>She faced the Spider Giant in a martial arts form which I hadn’t seen before.</p><p><br></p><p>It looked every bit as comical as it sounded. A small girl in her teens standing up against the likes of a giant like Tsuchigumo but the result was even more surprising or rather unsurprising for me. Tsuchigumo punched and Kuroka received it with a simple palm and twisted the attack and threw it to the side. I could feel the Nature Energy spin on the palm of her hand. In a flash, she was near the Youkai’s chest, she let out a palm thrust and a shockwave passed through its body as the huge Giant Spider flew through the shrine and into the opposite direction.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked back at the now gaping bunch of Youkai. “What the hell are you all waiting for? Get out and regroup. I will hold it here.” she shouted, getting their attention back.</p><p><br></p><p>The Giant Spider soon got up with a loud laugh and raced towards Kuroka once more, ignoring Rikuo and the others completely, his arms completely twisted and bent in other directions. He was using his strings to make his body act like a puppet just to fight.</p><p><br></p><p>It was of no use however as Kuroka just countered and threw him aside. After that it became a one sided thrashing.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahahaha more. I haven’t had this much fun since Nue. More.” The giant shouted as another Youkai from the side managed to slip him a vial.</p><p><br></p><p>Hmm, Phenex Tears?</p><p><br></p><p>“Boss.” Akira asked me, getting to his feet.</p><p>“It’s fine. Let me see how strong he is. Moreover Kuroka wants to have some fun.” I stopped him and just as I had predicted, Kuroka didn’t stop him from taking the vial either.</p><p><br></p><p>His wounds healed but I didn’t see any regeneration.</p><p><br></p><p>Does it only happen when he is buried in the earth?</p><p><br></p><p>“Akira, catch the one who passed the Phenex Tear to Tsuchigumo. Find out who they are working with and if there are other devils who arrived after we captured the last ones.”</p><p><br></p><p>The Kitsune vanished from my side and after the target.</p><p><br></p><p>The fight resumed on the other hand and Kuroka was still fighting at close quarters, literally throwing the giant around the place. The giant however started using spider threads to attack and bind her. Kuroka dodged them all and burned the ones she couldn’t dodge with Yojutsu flames.</p><p><br></p><p>It seems as if Sun Wukong has taught her more than just Senjutsu. Her martial arts have improved. She must have abused the Shadow Clones to reach this level so fast.</p><p><br></p><p>The fight lasted a while but the giant Spider Demon was beaten to a pulp by Kuroka using just close quarter combat skills.</p><p><br></p><p>She left the Youkai alone and I observed it to see how it regenerates. The guy buried himself under the soil and I used my Observation Haki to see how he was regenerating. He was absorbing energy from the earth and changing it into vitality. Very slow but still a completely new technique which required my keen attention.</p><p><br><br></p><p></p><p></p><p><br><br></p><p>“So how was I?” The not so little Nekoshou jumped at me, tails swinging from side to side to get my praise.</p><p><br></p><p>“It was like looking at the fight between David and Goliath, only in this case David was a cute girl who mopped the floor with Goliath. You have grown a lot, Kuroka. I am proud of you.” I scratched her ears and she purred as she clung to my side.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you find anything, Akira?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm. They sent the peerage members of the two Lords and several of the household members too. Surprisingly there were also some members of the Nebiros House. I had heard that they had some sort of cooperation with the Naberius House. They haven’t taken any permission from any of the leaders and it is a violation of the contract. Should I hunt them down Boss? The Naberius ones are some of those who were involved in the experimentations.” He asked with a cold glint in his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you know the details of the cooperation?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No Boss.” He shook his head.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then I will call for some backup. When they arrive, make sure none of them escape. Capture them, especially the Nebiros and the top members who might know of some useful information. If you can’t capture anyone though, kill. Just make sure that no one leaves here alive. I will do something that will keep the Great King Faction busy for a while.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Boss.” He nodded his head and I got to my plans.</p><p><br></p><p>It was time to unearth some buried skeletons to spook the old coots.</p><p><br></p><p>I spoke through my Binder’s Link.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“Ophelia, I will be sending some new guests today. They will all be reasonably strong. Make sure they sign the Loyalty Contracts and the Suicide Contracts.”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“My Lord, there has been news of Serafall Leviathan visiting the Youkai Factions to offer assistance. She might be visiting there soon to make some deals probably.”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“Oh. Do you know when this will be done?”</em> It was obvious on the other hand because they would definitely use the opportunity to soothe the ruffled feathers and amend relations with the Youkai.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“Tomorrow. I was about to inform you of this but I just got this news myself. They are worried because due to the absence of Devils, The Fallen Angels and the Church are expanding in Japan. They might lose the area and it might also become a hub of those two factions at this rate.”</em></p><p><br></p><p>Yes. That’s something that’s going on. I will have to think about what to do about it too.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe have a talk with Azazel?</p><p><br></p><p><em>“I will look into it. Although I don’t think any of the Youkai would say yes to it. Still, just in case, make them sign the loyalty and suicide contracts and send them back. A few spies in the Great King faction will be of great help. It would be better if Serafall takes them away. In that way, they will have to pay some political capital and those old coots will definitely cause some scenes to free their lackeys. When the conflict between the two sides is over, we will commence Operation Regicide.”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“Cleria. Tell Diehauser that we have some important evidence for Operation Regicide. We have one more King Piece user who has disclosed some vital information.”</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“Yes My Lord.”</em></p><p><br></p><p>Operation Regicide or Killing the King was a name suggested by Merlin. The mission was basically to reveal the existence of the King Pieces with all the proof and their connection to the Great King faction and Zekram Bael and kill their influence from the Rating Games as well as the influence of Zekram himself.</p><p><br></p><p>It will no doubt cause immense drama when it is revealed that Cleria Belial was ‘killed’ to hide this news and not because of the alleged crimes(which to be honest were not crimes at all). This will be enough to keep them out of anyone’s hair for a while.</p><p><br></p><p>This new information will just add a cherry on the top.</p><p><br></p><p>Once they lose their important lackeys, they will make noise and blame the Satans for allowing such a thing to happen(as ridiculous as it sounds). The Satans will have to either take a stand or give way and in either case, they will have their relations soured in this fiasco and lose some political capital.</p><p><br></p><p>Doing the Operation when the chaos calms down a bit will be making them lock horns again.</p><p><br></p><p>There are chances that they might know someone is causing this… but so what?</p><p><br></p><p>Even if they do find out, the best part about this is that they cannot do anything to stop this because the Rating Games are the basis of the current Devil Society. Once such a scam is revealed, there will be chaos among the general public who have been fighting the Rating Games to get a higher position in society. Once it is revealed that all of it was a scam to begin with, the results will be worth watching. All those Reincarnated Devils who have worked for centuries to somehow get a position as a High Class Devil and couldn’t go further in the Rating Games, all the suppressed Low and Mid Class Devils will all lash out. Maybe throw in some insiders and let them increase the damage.</p><p><br></p><p>They will obviously make a temporary truce to stop the chaos but… that’s when the idiots from the Old Satan faction come into play. Moreover, I will be leaving some traces of the Old Satan faction behind this just like I did in the Youkai incident.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact I even had Katerea send an invitation for the Youkai to join the people of the Old Satan faction and in return they will send support, which they rejected because of me. The plan has to be carefully executed so that it’s convincing.</p><p><br></p><p>Katerea has been severely monitored before but it was reduced when I <em>died</em>. She has been working to establish a place for herself once more.</p><p><br></p><p>There were many people who had been disappointed by my death in the Old Satan faction because they thought that I would kill the false Satans and bring them to glory or some similar shit. Katerea had collected many of the people under her and was working out several plans to increase her influence in the Old Satan faction by using them.</p><p><br></p><p>And now it was time to use all of the resources.</p><p><br></p><p>Moreover, the last move of the Operation Regicide will shake the entire foundation of the current government.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Serafall Leviathan -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“What’s this meeting about, Sirzechs? I was about to go to Kyoto to meet with Yasaka and offer them assistance. You know how important this matter is. The things over there are getting worse day by day. Maybe this will help us solve some problems with the Youkai and the smaller factions.” She complained as she entered the office.</p><p><br></p><p>She had been sleeping in her office for months now, running to every small faction to soothe the problems those idiots had caused. Forcing someone into a peerage is one thing. It has been done before and was ignored as well due to their influence and power. Sirzechs had Surtr, the second and Enku in Sirzechs’ peerage and although they willingly joined the peerage, their factions were quite displeased with it and yet it passed on. This time however it was completely different. They had made the first move and were even kidnapping and experimenting on Youkai. And even after being brought out to the open, they went ahead and taunted the other faction rather than lay low for a while.</p><p><br></p><p>Several smaller factions around the world who had previously kept their heads down suddenly huddled together to protect themselves because they were afraid that if a mid-sized faction like the Youkai were treated like this, they might as well be swallowed whole. And even if she was on the wrong side of the sword, she had to agree that this was a valid point.</p><p><br></p><p>The other factions had started to pick up their resistance since that scandal with the Church and the Norse faction. No one expected Odin to take a stance and such a solid one, making the Church and Heaven take a step back from their aggressive expansion of their forces to keep up with the reincarnated devils.</p><p><br></p><p>In the office Sirzechs was sitting with Ajuka, Falbium while Grayfia was standing behind him.</p><p><br></p><p>Surprisingly Okita Souji and Mathews were also present.</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you going to Kyoto today?” He asked and she had the urge to freeze his head to wake him up. No one could blame her for being grouchy due to her current workload but, apart from her, Sirzechs was probably the one with the most amount of workload so she lit out a sigh and sat down and nodded back.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes. The condition in Kyoto is getting worse. I asked Azazel for a meeting and called in a favour to let him arrange a meeting for me. I don’t think they would appreciate me going there directly.” She replied, stretching a bit. She hadn't had a proper sleep for days now.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs looked tense and then nodded. “If Azazel is going, then it might be a problem.”</p><p><br></p><p>She raised an eyebrow. What did he mean by that?</p><p><br></p><p>“We have news that the Old Satan faction, specifically Katerea Leviathan, tried to make contact with Yasaka and the Youkai factions.”</p><p><br></p><p>She paused and sat up straight in her seat. “Explain.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Katerea tried to offer them <em>help</em> against us if they needed it. They rejected it, however the Old Satan faction appearing there in itself is a big problem.”</p><p><br></p><p>“When did this happen?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Two days ago. The news was received through one of our oldest spies.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So, she was rejected. They know just as well as anyone that the Old Satan faction cannot be trusted. Even more of a reason that I go there as fast as I can.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That was not the only news he revealed. This was the last piece of information he could send us before he was taken down. We haven’t received any information from that end yet. They have tightened the security even more and only select people are allowed anywhere near Yasaka’s place.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sirzechs, I am extremely tired and irritated. The only reason I am listening to you is because you are in the same condition so let’s make this easier for the two of us. Speak everything at once.” She asked straightforwardly.</p><p><br></p><p>“The Youkai, more specifically, the Eastern Youkai Faction are currently allied to a certain Devil. I have tried to investigate him to find proof of his identity for the last six months, since Rias accidentally encountered him and his Half Devil Sister to verify the information I received about him. I was… afraid of making any overt moves because if the news about this person was made public, there could be a Civil War depending on this guy’s mood.” He massaged his head and a face came to Serafall’s mind as her spine chilled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is HE making a move? But why? What would attract his attention in the Youkai faction? Rizevim doesn’t move for things like this.” She looked at Falbium who looked at Sirzechs with a glare and even Ajuka threw a slightly disappointed glare at his friend. So they also found out about it now.</p><p><br></p><p>“It was not Rizevim…” He raised a hand to stop Falbium. “But it was a Lucifer.” And that sent everyone to silence again. He made a hologram of a child around fourteen years of age.“This is the person.”</p><p><br></p><p>Falbium was wide awake and sitting on his chair all of a sudden and Ajuka’s face became solemn while she felt a massive headache building.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is this your idea of a prank or are you seriously thinking that this is true.” She deadpanned.</p><p><br></p><p>“He had twelve wings.” Grayfia intervened and any words she was going to say, struck in her mouth.</p><p><br></p><p>“And why are we only hearing about this now.” Falbium asked in a pointed tone, being the first one to question.</p><p><br></p><p>While it was true that all the Satans worked independently and no one interfered in anyone’s work. Hell, if they knew what was going on in Ajuka’s lab, she was pretty sure she would need heart medication for months and Sirzechs could technically keep all this to himself but still… This was something they all needed to know.</p><p><br></p><p>“I was trying to solve the misunderstanding that might have been caused in the first meeting. Heinrich did something that caused a massive misunderstanding and I had to clean up the situation. I don’t even have a solid link to that person or know his name to know if he is the real deal but I still couldn’t act just in case he was. The one person who could connect to him is another Youkai who is his subordinate and has confirmed as such to Souji but the identity of this Youkai also made it nigh impossible for me to force anything. We tried to contact her several times but she left her territory soon after and I was waiting for an opportunity to meet the Lucifer personally before deciding anything.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What did Heinrich do? Also, who is this Youkai?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I had sent Henreich to bring Rias to save Barakiel’s daughter. She is a Half Fallen Angel and her mother was from the Himejima Clan, one of the Five Principal Clans. They had killed the mother and had placed information about her in the Devil’s black market. I called Azazel and he asked me to take her in if I could because the Grigori would be dangerous for the girl. The Himejima Clan members however hadn’t captured the girl but instead chased her around until they got a Fallen Angel to intervene.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So push the hot potato on us.” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“The girl was the most probable candidate for inheriting the Vermillion Bird. The problem however happened when Heinrich found her, she was being protected by the White Dragon Empress, a Half Devil White Dragon Empress and her two friends who were supposedly as strong as a High Class Devil in their teenage years.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The White Dragon is a Half Devil?” She felt the headache growing.</p><p><br></p><p>“So Heinrich offered them all protection under the Gremory House. They denied and he made a mistake… he used my Lucifer Title to offer them protection and that’s when that person came out. The boy is exactly as I showed you according to Heinrich and Rias both and the White Dragon Empress… is his younger half sister.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Fuck!”</p><p><br></p><p>“So they misunderstood it as Heinrich coming for the Lucifer girl instead of the Fallen Angel.” Falbium guessed.</p><p><br></p><p>“It could be some kind of an illusion?” Ajuka said.</p><p><br></p><p>“He stood in a place and asked the Himejima Clan members to attack him. He would give them the girl if they made him move from the place. Those crazy bastards even used the Vermillion Bird’s full power attack and he dispersed it just by blowing on it.” He drank some water and continued. “I… won’t lie, I tried to contain the information for some personal reasons too. The boy said that he knew that it was an unintentional mistake and even if he didn’t get along with the warmongers, if anyone tried to come for his sister again, he could remedy the situation of the Lucifers not participating in the last war. The identity of the subordinate is also complicated. She is a sage and an apprentice of Sun Wukong. A thirteen year old Ultimate Class Youkai who was a student of Magari, the Vice Commander of Nurarihyon. They are allies because on investigating, they didn’t say a single word about him. The girl however said that he wants to be left alone. I did just that by not informing anyone about him. The old guys will never leave him alone and I have no idea what kind of a person he is.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You should have still told us faster. This… is quite big.” Falbium shook his head.</p><p><br></p><p>“So the Half Devil girl, the White Dragon Empress, is a Lucifer too?” Ajuka asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“A year or two younger than Rias, six winged and with a Balance Breaker.” Sirzechs replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is so troublesome.” Falbium banged his head on the table.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why does that clan produce such monsters only? Twelve wings and fourteen. Even the two of you needed eighteen or so years before you were at such a level. So this means that the Lucifers might have two Satan Class Devils at minimum and hopefully that’s where it ends… Moreover, why would a sage become his subordinate? Also why would the Youkai even allow such a thing.” She groaned. She could understand why Sirzechs would hide such a thing. Annoying it may be but she understood it. The Gremory Clan was involved and that face… Looks that can cause a war had never been so literal before. If things got out, some might even throw the blame or raise some rumors about the Gremory trying to usurp or erase the Lucifer House. The fact that it was Sirzechs’ Clan would complicate matters beyond repair. Ah, that mess.</p><p><br></p><p>“The girl was his subordinate even before she became a Sage.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Is that why you were so nervous when dealing with the Youkai? The incident with Rias’ queen and even this one. If this guy were to reveal himself… It would be much more troublesome than what we had to agree to. I had doubts why you were giving up so easily because we could have gotten some more concessions. The Youkai <em>did</em> kill our people too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I was and am still trying to be careful, Serafall. If the news gets to other people, especially Zekram, I can’t even begin to guess what would happen. Heinrich is a High Class Devil. He can be tricked. The Youkai are skilled with Illusion Techniques. Also in all of the meetings, Souji and Mathers didn’t meet the real guy. It can be him… It can be someone else. I just did what I thought was best. I am not even sure how this kind of rumor will be received in the Underworld. And then there was always the danger of Rizevim interfering if he really is a Lucifer.” He defended and despite her anger, she had to agree that the situation itself was delicate. Him crying wolf over every guy who puts on a Lucifer mask wouldn’t do well with the title of Lucifer. And he dealt with the situation as safely as he could.</p><p><br></p><p>“So you want me to meet him during my visit to Kyoto if I can?”</p><p><br></p><p>“If possible, yes. Do as you feel is necessary. The name of his subordinate is Kuroka.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will look into it.”</p><p><br></p><p>Another headache for her to take care of.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you have anything else you want to share? You do look slightly irritated when talking about him.” Ajuka spoke.</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s when Sirzechs burst. “Obviously I am irritated. This guy comes out of nowhere and acts a bit cool and now my little sister is smitten with him. She is even training like mad because she wants to get him. I have no idea what that means or what goes on in the heads of teenage girls but that’s extremely irritating. My cute little Ria-tan trains until she’s on the verge of fainting sometimes all because she met this casanova once. I am telling you Serafall, keep your sister away from him. I don’t know if it was any kind of magic. We have tried and tried but didn’t find any trace of it. Father is actually excited by Rias’ progress but she is doing it all for him. Him, not her Onii-sama… him.” He went on a rant until Grayfia took him by the cheek and stopped his rant midway.</p><p><br></p><p>So the boy might be a playboy of some kind. I must keep So-tan away from him!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Yasaka -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>She looked at the unconscious and tied up Devils in front of her. One of them was a person she identified. The Head of the Naberius House whose Clan had experimented on the Youkai… although he didn’t look like he would live much longer. She looked at the young child whose expressions might as well have been frozen as he looked at the Devil without a single shred of emotion. She didn’t blame him however. She in fact appreciated the amount of control the boy had at such an age for not killing the scum at the first sight.</p><p><br></p><p>“My Lord sends this as a gift. These are the things we could get from them. Some other people were unfortunate casualties in the capture.” He spoke although she noted that not once did his eyes leave the Naberius Devil.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at the file and her eyes grew colder with each bit of information. The experiments on Youkai to discover the secrets of Senjutsu. She gripped the pages, her claws retracting briefly as she saw the price that was decided for their assistance in the birth of Nue.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy beside her sensed her killing intent and spoke. “You know, I wanted to do it too. Shove a hand down his throat and rip his beating heart out and then feed it back to him, one piece at a time, but… My Lord told me something that made me reconsider. I wonder if you will think the same.” She looked at her and he completed it. “The dead don’t suffer.”</p><p><br></p><p>Her claws retreated back at the words. Yes. The dead don’t suffer. These people need to suffer. They need to suffer for putting Kunou in danger. They needed to suffer for even entertaining any thoughts on her daughter in their filthy degraded minds.</p><p><br></p><p>She took deep breaths to calm herself down. She was not at full strength yet. The weapon and poison used against her were both deadly for Youkai. She was lucky to survive as it is. She would need a considerable period of time to recover completely.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at the boy beside her. Yes. Maybe this can work.</p><p><br></p><p>“Remind me to start your training in Youjutsu Illusion arts when we begin. Capturing enemies is much easier when using such a technique. I know that Senjutsu comes easily to you due to… Whatever Miracle your Lord has done for you and you can get trained by Kuroka in it but we Kitsune just like the Nekoshou’s Kasha have our own Unique Skills. These skills will help you become all rounded in a battle and I will teach these to you. To be honest, controlling the Leylines would be even easier for you due to your affinity with Nature Energy.” She pointed out to the boy as she read more of the file and even she was appalled at the sheer audacity of the fools.</p><p><br></p><p>The real goal of the Devils was to capture Nue for their research, the resurrection of Nue was due to a technique and it helped Nue to become stronger and break past his limits. They wanted to replicate it.</p><p><br></p><p>These fools thought that they could fool Hagoromo Gitsune and Nue, the entire Kyoto Youkai under them and capture Nue… and force him to give away his secrets.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked back at the fool and yes, indeed. It would be for the best to leave these fools alive just so they can suffer living in their own stupidity. She would just tear away all the appendages on their body first and burn them with Fox Fire until unrecognizable.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will be honoured to receive instructions from you.” The boy bowed.</p><p><br></p><p>“I hear that you are learning some techniques from your Lord. Have you completed your training?” She asked, having received the information from Magari after the alliance was signed.</p><p><br></p><p>“My Lord… is somewhat of a genius when it comes to magic. I am sure you have heard how the entire Magic System of the Devils was ingrained in their very blood. Lucifer himself was a genius of magic who was matched by few even till today. My Lord, in the honest opinion of some people who have seen and experienced Lucifer themselves, makes him look like a child in comparison in terms of talent.” The boy spoke and she halted her steps for a bit and looked at the boy. His eyes showed belief and that he believed every word he said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, and you believe that?”</p><p><br></p><p>“At first I didn’t. I thought it was just empty talk to sell their Master and deify him but… I saw it with my own eyes. This man, no he’s barely a teenager, has created two separate systems of magic entirely just for his subordinates and is working on a new system of magic that would be revolutionary for the Ayakashi. I am talking about Systems of Magic. Not spells but entire systems from the scratch. Techniques that even Sun Wukong couldn’t copy from Kuroka. I am being trained in two of these systems currently. It is a must for anyone joining our team to master the basics of these two systems regardless of their races. We have had members of different races learn this from him successfully. By the time I was done witnessing all this, I didn’t have any choice but to believe in the assessment.”</p><p><br></p><p>She didn’t feel a single lie in the statement. Was that young man really that talented?</p><p><br></p><p>She had heard from Nurarihyon that he had manhandled Hagoromo Gitsune so he had to be strong. Stronger than a normal Satan… maybe like those two anomalies but being strong and this… were two completely different things. Could her people learn it too? This whole incident had made the entire faction extremely weak. Could this really save her faction by giving it the much needed boost in strength?</p><p><br></p><p>“Then, when we begin our training, I would like to see these systems of magic you praise so much in action. I might make some deals with him to teach it to some of our members if they are practical.” She asked. She doubted that anyone who would make it to the teams of such a person would be anything less than a genius but still, she will have to see the situation for herself.</p><p><br></p><p></p><p></p><p><br></p><p>She was sitting in the centre of the room with Kuroka, Nurarihyon and Magari beside her. She could feel Akira was present behind the sliding doors under several layers of seals to hide his presence from the <em>guests</em> sitting in front of her. As for Akira’s Lord, he was not in the area or at least she couldn’t sense him near the entire place even when she spread her senses the furthest.</p><p><br></p><p>“What do you want, Serafall? It was only due to some favours from Azazel that I or rather we even allowed this meeting.” She spoke and no one blamed her for her tone.</p><p><br></p><p>“I know you are angry. I know you deserve to be angry. I know things have not been good between us and we are trying to make things right Yasaka. If nothing, at least give us the credit where it is due.” Serafall replied calmly and she observed that the Satan was nervous. Her gaze at Kuroka was not as subtle when in a room with the masters of Senjutsu. She continued. “We found out about the current situation of the Youkai. I am here to offer assistance to the Youkai Faction if it is needed.”</p><p><br></p><p>“If you want to offer assistance, then stop sending people to assist Hagoromo Gitsune. It was more annoying to capture the devils than taking down the Ayakashi led by Hagoromo Gitsune.” Kuroka mocked and she looked at Serafall’s reaction, her Senjutsu perceiving every bit of emotion she could to judge if Serafall knew anything about it.</p><p><br></p><p>The Devil in question was completely taken aback and then collected herself. “Who might you be talking about? I assure you that we haven’t sent anyone.”</p><p><br></p><p>She brought out the list of names and passed it on to Serafall who quickly perused the list and she noticed the corners of the paper freezing slightly before going back to normal. “Do you have anything I can take as proof?” She spoke in a formal tone.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have them in my dungeons but you will not be taking anyone. They wanted my daughter. Their deal for assisting was a nine tailed fox for the one they lost. They belong to me now.” She took a deep breath and reigned her killing intent. Her weakened state was affecting her temper more than she realised before.</p><p><br></p><p>Serafall sighed. “Could we negotiate something? I will need them for interrogation to get proof and take any action. Without it, I don’t think I can even take any action against them.”</p><p><br></p><p>She was going to deny the request but someone was faster than her.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka spoke again. “Tell me something, Miss Serafall. What would you do if you were on our side and the one who had been the target of this had been your sister instead. Go on.”</p><p><br></p><p>She watched Serafall’s expression freeze at the mention of her sister.</p><p><br></p><p>“Exactly. I know your answer even without you saying anything. I have a little sister of my own and if any of those cretin had targeted her, I would have killed them all even if I had to burn down the entire world to do so. As for the proof, you don’t need to worry about it. We will send you all the results of the interrogation. As for the prisoners, they will be dealt with after we are done with this fiasco.”</p><p><br></p><p>“If we could offer anything that would make you reconsider. Getting the prisoners would really help us dig out the people behind it. We will be able to help you all out with it. I assure you that they will get punished. We will even offer free assistance to clear this problem with the Kyoto Youkai’s rebellion.” Serafall asked again.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hehehehe do you really think this problem of ours is as bad as it looks? Did you know that none of the older ones have yet to step on the battlefield? It is only the younger ones who are tearing through the ranks of Hagoromo Gitsune. While the start was indeed a bit surprising to us due to the interference of the Devils, the situation is under control. This is a Youkai matter. We are not so weak that we cannot take care of our own problems. Moreover, do tell me what punishment will they get for bringing such a disaster to us, the kidnapping of Yasaka-sama’s daughter, the assassination attempt on Yasaka-sama, causing a Civil War among our kind, attacking, kidnapping and killing members of our faction to experiment on. What according to you is a reasonable punishment for it?”</p><p><br></p><p>Serafall held her tongue a second too much for Kuroka’s temper.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s right. You will at best ban them from the Rating Game, make them retire from your council, make them pay fines, or reprimand them to not be <em>bad devils</em> anymore?”</p><p><br></p><p>“There are very few Pure Blooded Devils left in this world. Please understand that each one of them is an asset.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Says the one who killed Pure Blooded Devils wholesale a few hundred years ago. But we are not talking about that are we? Moreover if we are talking about the rarity of a species, the devils still have over a hundred of them while there are only three Nine Tailed Foxes in the world.” Kuroka quipped.</p><p><br></p><p>Serafall’s eyes sharpened a bit at the quip. “You seem to hold some opinions against the devil faction. Tell me, are your opinions your own or does it have anything to do with your <em>Master</em>? I am curious, I heard that your Master was allied with Nurarihyon. Why didn’t he appear to lend a hand?”</p><p><br></p><p>It was as if the air in the whole room stilled. She sensed a light agitation in Akira’s aura behind the sliding doors before it calmed down completely.</p><p><br></p><p>She had figured out one thing about the new Lucifer's subordinates, they were <em>extremely</em> loyal to him. Akira respected him as his saviour. Kuroka on the other hand was downright smitten with the boy. And now, Serafall was about to understand this fact too.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka’s entire temperament shifted to a completely frozen one. Her eyes were as if losing all emotions completely so much so that even the feeling that she could get from her Senjutsu was erased. She could literally feel nothing from her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you truly wish to know my Master’s thoughts?” She looked back into Serafall’s eyes who was taken aback for a moment at the change, a very short moment, nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“I had once asked my Master if he felt any kind of anger against the current government for the Civil War. He had simply smiled and answered that if the previous leaders of the three Satan Clans were anything like the three idiots, Creuserey, Katerea and Shalba, he could understand why there was a Civil War. The Lucifer House didn’t participate in the Civil War and it is none of his concern. I had then proceeded to ask him if he wanted to be a Satan or take back that title and he outright broke out in laughter. His exact words were, ‘Sit on the chair as a puppet head doing paperwork everyday and be a chew toy for those self-entitled old dogs. Please. It takes a special kind of masochist to take that. That’s not something I can bear.’ As impossible as it might be for you to believe, my Master doesn’t care about the Civil War or the position of a Satan. You forget something very basic, something very elementary - Unlike the other three Satan Clans, the Lucifer House <em>created</em> the entire Devil Race. To explain it in more simpler terms, have you ever seen the owner of an ant farm being jealous of the Ant Queen?”</p><p><br></p><p>The room was in pin drop silence as the two black haired females stared into each other's eyes before the younger one continued.</p><p><br></p><p>\"And yet, somehow my Master seems to have a certain appreciation and dare I say even a hint of respect for you four. It's because despite the rest of the race being borderline suicidal, you four seem to carry it on your own shoulders. Back in the times of the original Satans, the pillars, despite being rowdy, were firmly in their grasp, making things easier for them. You four don't have that privilege and yet are holding a major part of the entire race together somehow with intelligence, policies and sometimes brute power. That's something my Master appreciates. I have already relayed the message and intention of my Master to remain uninvolved in the matters of devils politics, and yet you come here, poking at his name, let's leave him aside. Tell me what exactly are your intentions towards my Master, Miss Serafall?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"We don't have any intentions about him either. I was informed that my colleague had already relayed that if he needed something, we would be eager to help. It was just your aggressive attitude towards the devils made me wonder about your Master's own views, after all, we still haven't been able to meet him personally. It just makes one curious about him.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"My views are my own. I believe being aggressive towards someone who attacks one's home is a normal reaction for anyone. My Master doesn't force servitude or his views on anyone. That's a new trend from your side.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Neither of the two gave any leeway and finally Nurarihyon coughed to stop the stalemate.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Okay, stop it you two. Serafall, stop fishing for information. If he wants to meet you, he will contact you. I have met the person a few times and he is not someone who wants a war. Despite his young age, he is very reasonable. And Kuroka, stop being a child every time someone says anything about him. She’s baiting you and you are falling for it. Try acting more responsibly.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I am a child.\" Kuroka, whose emotionless state went back to normal, pouted before realizing something. “Wait, she was baiting me!”</p><p><br></p><p>\"And now you are one of the strongest of the Youkai faction too. Do act like one. Also, she’s one of the leaders of her race. She faces such comments in every single meeting. Do you think she will lose her temper so easily? She must have gotten reports about your characters from the meetings you had with Okita Souji and Mathers and used them to set you up. And you fell for it.\" He then turned to Serafall. \" You have already seen the reports briefly. Go and take a good look at it. Any talks about the prisoners come after that. We appreciate you trying to lend us a hand but this is something we must do by ourselves. We know that you are trying and working to soothe things over but please understand that Yasaka almost lost her child and life both. We all need some time to recover from this. We will contact you after the mess over here is cleared.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Magari was just looking at her apprentice who was still realizing what had happened in her head.</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, Nurarihyon always kept the more rowdy type of Youkai under him, what with the Youkai Yakuza and all.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl was still young and even if she had gotten the strength, she needed to learn a lot more about politics and the world in general.</p><p><br></p><p>At least Akira had a much more controlled temper compared to Kuroka.</p><p><br></p><p>The rest of the meeting was taken over by Nurarihyon and Magari and Serafall finally left.</p><p><br></p><p>“You will be studying the basics of politics all over again. The training with that Old Monkey has made you more of a bull-headed brute than a proper Nekoshou. You are a sage. You can use Senjutsu. Use it to get a feel of her emotions, her feelings to avoid any traps.” Magari got up and lectured the girl who was trying to burn the place Serafall was sitting on with a glare.</p><p><br></p><p>“I haven’t learned emotion sensing properly. He was teaching me martial arts and the ways to manipulate Nature Energy all this time. I was spending the rest of my time reigning in my power. My training isn’t complete yet.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then you will study while training.” Magari cut off any retort before it came.</p><p><br></p><p>“Have you had any formal training in Politics, Akira?” She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>The door behind her slid aside and Akira entered the room. “I haven’t had any such training yet. My wanted status made any such training a waste for now. So, we focused on increasing my strength alone.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yet you are a free man now. You will be attending lessons on politics too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“As you say, Yasaka-sama.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The war is reaching its final stage. I believe that the preparations for the resurrection of Nue are complete. I will rely on you two to watch over Rikuo and the rest of the children. They have grown a lot in the past week, more than I could have expected them to grow in times of peace and yet, Nue and Hagoromo Gitsune are not foes children can face.” Nurarihyon spoke.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry about it, Supreme Commander. The ones currently overlooking the kids could end the war by themselves if they wanted. Even that sly bi… Serafall would be helpless against them. Nue and Hagoromo Gitsune may be strong but they will not be able to harm Rikuo-sama and others.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Is that so… that’s reassuring to hear. I don’t suppose you can tell us who they are.”</p><p><br></p><p>“They are both the most trusted people under Master.”</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at Akira for a reformation and he nodded. “Those two are reliable. If we talk about them in terms of a peerage, they are my Lord’s Queen and Bishop pieces. I apologise for not being able to say more than that.”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded. She was just getting to know Damien Lucifer but she knew what a Queen Piece meant. The Vice Commander of the Peerage and the most trusted of the King.</p><p><br></p><p>“Where did your Master go though? I thought he would be here watching the result of his deal.” Nurarihyon asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“The deal was decided in my Lord’s favour the moment it was made. Hagoromo Gitsune will join us.” Akira replied and the conviction in his voice was completely unshakable.</p><p><br></p><p>It made her wonder about Damien Lucifer a bit more.</p><p><br></p><p>Here she couldn’t even trust her own husband whom she had been with for centuries and on the other hand, this boy was making people become so loyal to him in a matter of months.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Damien -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the building in the distance as Sean beside me shifted nervously.</p><p><br></p><p>“Boss, are you sure about this? I thought you didn’t want to do anything like this for a long while.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I cannot think of anything else that would work. This plan has to work. Currently the ones who can detect or stop me are mostly busy with meetings. I don’t know when I would find another such opportunity again. We have to take it or it will be a massive pain in the neck to create such an opportunity again.” I replied as I scanned the area with my Observation Haki.</p><p><br></p><p>“If the shorty and Boss Lady find out about this, they will neuter me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then you better make sure they don’t find out. I sent Merlin with Gretel to keep her occupied and Vienna is currently training with Cleria and Lavinia. They will not be interfering in this.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Still… to think getting spanked by your teacher was all it took to get you out of your stubbornness and get together with the Boss Lady.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We are not together yet.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yea… I believe you… totally.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Officially.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes yes whatever. With the way you both are now, we don’t need anything official. To be honest, there was a sort of betting pool going on about who would be the first girl. Boss Lady was in second position. Most of them thought it would be Kuroka who would get you drunk someday and take the lead.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You people have too much free time. I think I should include some social etiquette lessons to help you calm down.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ughh… dancing and stuff. Please, I’d rather take the cleaning duty than that.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay all done. We are all ready for the mission. Give me the spear.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, be careful, Boss.” Sean replied as he summoned the Spear again.</p><p><br></p><p>I took a deep breath in and took a hold of the spear.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“The Lord is my God.”</em></p><p><br></p><p>Twelve silver wings burst out of my back, the holy aura radiating even more than the first time. I could feel the light getting stronger and my power roaring in this form.</p><p><br></p><p>I shook my head and quickly focused on my current task. It was time for the mission.</p><p></p><p></p><p><br></p><p></p><p></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: LuluViBritania(FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>A quick chapter for ‘Deal with the Devil’.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The last chapter was too much of an infodump so I decided to write a new one.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am planning to wrap things up in the next chapter for the Kyoto Youkai arc.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Also what is Damien doing in the meantime?</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Find out in the next episode of Drag… <em>cough</em> <em>cough</em> next chapter of ‘Deal with the Devil’.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br></p>",

How did it get past my Observation Haki? Almost as if instinctively, I jumped to the side and tried to counter but to my horror, my speed had been reduced to that of a normal human’s. I watched as the light spear headed my way only for it to pass through me as if an illusion.</p><p><br></p><p>BOOM.</p><p><br></p><p>There was an explosion behind me but I didn’t feel anything, the shockwave, the energy, nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>Ah… it was another one of those.</p><p><br></p><p>I watched as two boys appeared behind me.</p><p><br></p><p>“See that. I totally mastered that spell. I won again.” The silver haired boy laughed with his hands on his waist.</p><p><br></p><p>“How do you do that everytime. I cannot even form that spell yet.” The golden blonde pouted cutely in the reply</p><p><br></p><p>“Hahahaha I am just better it seems.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Not fair.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Everyone is different at different things. Your brother is good at Magic while you are good with a sword. You need not be upset over it. Use what you have and strive to be your best.” Another voice was heard from behind the two children and there stood <strong><em>HIM</em></strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>“Father!” The boys shouted in unison as they ran to the man who patted their heads.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you understand that?” He asked the elder of the two siblings.</p><p><br></p><p>The golden blonde nodded his head at the man.</p><p><br></p><p>“You did a great job in learning the spell so quickly.” He continued towards the silver haired one who preened at the compliment. “But… don’t let that turn into pride, my son for…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Pride comes before the Fall,” The silver haired boy quoted.</p><p><br></p><p>“Very good. Now, I believe that you two must be tired. Go and take some rest. Don’t overwork yourselves.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, Father.”</p><p><br></p><p>The two children walked towards the distance and I followed them.</p><p><br></p><p>It was when they were away from the man, the silver haired one smirked. “Father likes me more.”</p><p><br></p><p>The golden blonde just rolled his eyes, used to his brother’s antics by now. “He loves everyone equally, brother.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Keep telling yourself that, Michael.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Whatever you say, Helel.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>The scene blacked out in front of me and I woke up on my bed.</p><p><br></p><p>Another one of those dreams. Although it was the first time I saw something of the younger days. I wonder if this was because of me getting the second Holy Relic yesterday.</p><p><br></p><p>It took four months for my team to find, contact and bring Meredith Ordinton to our base.</p><p><br></p><p>She was a young girl even younger than Asia. She was not yet enrolled in the Golden Dawn Mage Association so they had to search for her through other links.</p><p><br></p><p>She accepted the offer readily and joined our group since it was Merlin himself who invited her.</p><p><br></p><p>An aspiring magician getting an offer from ‘The Merlin’. It was like a dream come true for her. In fact she didn’t even feel bothered when our identities were revealed as she already knew that magicians made contracts with Devils and thus such a thing was nothing new. She was a bit surprised but that was the extent of it. In fact she was actually a bit of a fangirl and thought that only someone like Merlin could make a contract with Lucifer himself. I laughed at the childish innocence the girl has.</p><p><br></p><p>It was quite refreshing.</p><p><br></p><p>Awakening her Sacred Gear didn’t take much effort as just a slight infusion of Magic and it was enough for her to manifest the Holy Nails, the Alphecca Tyrant.</p><p><br></p><p>This time there was no unconscious attraction to the nails.</p><p><br></p><p>They just appeared in front of me and I touched them. A momentary flash of light passed in front of me and the process was done. This one didn’t turn me into an Archangel or anything thank goodness for that at least. Although I did feel my eyes get wet with some tears for no reason at all.</p><p><br></p><p>The energy rushed inside me and I could feel as if a pressure on my soul… on my whole being was becoming lesser. It was hard to express it in words. The last time I had been asleep for a while but this time it didn’t even take seconds and thus I was able to feel everything happening to my being, my entire self. My senses cleared and my demonic power started to rise.</p><p><br></p><p>The four months of training were mostly spent inside Merlin’s Innovate Clear’s domain where the time was accelerated by several times and I could spend almost a year and a half inside. My demonic power level as well as the skills in various magic had increased significantly. Even then, the increase from the Holy Relic was significant. It was almost as much Demonic Power as a Peak Satan Class Devil had, slightly lesser than the last one but still enough to push my Demonic Power to almost seven times that of a Peak Satan Class Devil, very close to a Super Devil. One more such gain and some training and I might be there. Eight months were left for my visit to the Tepes Castle in case Valerie’s whereabouts were not found by then.</p><p><br></p><p>By then if I could get one more Holy Relic or even touch them for a few moments, it should be enough.</p><p><br></p><p>This was according to the calculations made by Merlin.</p><p><br></p><p>I had spent around one and a half years inside Innovate Clear and was fifteen years old. This gained me two Binder Marks as well as two more from Alphecca Tyrant.</p><p><br></p><p>This led to Musashi, Ingvild, Akeno, Tsubaki and Sean getting marked.</p><p><br></p><p>Speaking of Merlin. The guy had grown a lot in the last four months. From a Peak Ultimate Class to a Peak Satan Class in just the amount of Magical Reserves. If matched with his Sacred Gear, I am pretty sure, he would even give beings beyond even the Satan Class a good challenge.</p><p><br></p><p>Actually everyone had progressed significantly but decided to continue their training.</p><p><br></p><p>Some things happened in this time period.</p><p><br></p><p>We set up a dimension on the ocean floor. It was difficult to even stay there normally but thanks to the help of our newest member, the Sea Serpent of the End, it was quite easy to do so.</p><p><br></p><p>Ingvild was growing at an exponential pace. She was already a High Satan Class when she woke up, without any kind of training. This was not considering her Sacred Gear at all.</p><p><br></p><p>With the Binder's mark and training, her Demonic Power soared and so did her training with her Clan Trait. The Sea Serpent of the End matched with her Nereid Kyrie made it easy for us to establish the dimension inside the ocean and prepare for the next Chakra Fruit. This one required quite a lot of effort to make. The absorption was also kept low and will take around a year to complete.</p><p><br></p><p>In the meantime, Cleria has been working on something even more ridiculous. A Ten Tails that could absorb the negativity and demonic powers of the pits and make a fruit from it.</p><p><br></p><p>Pits were not something anyone ever touched due to the insane amounts of Demonic Beasts present there. Hundreds and thousands of kilometers of area around the pits were completely filled to the brim with demonic beasts who keep on spawning.</p><p><br></p><p>If this plan was successful, it would be a great boon for us  but… such things were easier said than done.</p><p><br></p><p>Cleria did become a solid Satan Class Devil like her cousin with all her training.</p><p><br></p><p>Speaking of her cousin, Diehauser hunted a Rating Game player with the King Piece.</p><p><br></p><p>Helena is currently studying the piece in her lab.</p><p><br></p><p>The one who had progressed the most among my subordinates however was Gretel.</p><p><br></p><p>She had watched the ideas I had given from some of the previous anime and picked up a few characters whose powers she tried to mimic. It started with simple teleportation of Minato and the techniques of Obito which she easily mastered. The main difficulty started when she tried to imitate Gojo's Infinity using her Space Magic. Her idea was to repeatedly create several layers of space between the attacks and her to stop any kind of attack.</p><p><br></p><p>I won't lie but even I was a bit excited to think about her achieving this.</p><p><br></p><p>Her Demonic Power had risen to almost three times that of Serafall. I almost pity her enemies by the end of her training.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka, while not being able to use the Innovate Clear Dimension, still grew quite well as she gained two tails in this short while and was now a seven tailed Nekoshou, making her enter the Peak of the Ultimate Class level. It was however the skills she was taught by Sun Wukong that made the difference.</p><p><br></p><p>Lavinia had also trained quite hard and was a solid Satan Class in her Demonic Power alone. She would be stronger with her Sacred Gear.</p><p><br></p><p>On the other hand Vienna and Akeno were training under Merlin and Celine to master their respective powers. </p><p><br></p><p>I had asked Azazel about some notes on Holy Lightning from Barakiel for Akeno. Now that had been a talk. Apparently, Azazel had asked Sirzechs to bring Akeno to the peerage of Rias.</p><p><br></p><p>This was because some elements in the Grigori were acting up and her life would have been in danger in the Grigori.</p><p><br></p><p>He was a bit tired and then relieved that she ended up with me. Apparently Sirzechs didn't say anything about the meeting to Azazel and he had been worried for the worst.</p><p><br></p><p>He sent the information and even some equipment to help train Akeno in the use of Holy Lightning. The notes were also helpful for Celine who finally gained her sixth pair of wings. I am waiting for the day she appears in front of the world and especially Uriel. It would be a sight to see. She then got the power from several Fallen Angels who had refused to join us, further boosting her powers.</p><p><br></p><p>Ophelia pointed out that the training inside Innovate Clear aged the children faster and putting them through such child soldier-like training would have bad effects on them so for now, only the older members trained inside Innovate Clear until they were of a certain age. Gaining strength too fast wouldn't do any good for Vienna with the habit of getting cocky.</p><p><br></p><p>They were still being trained seriously though.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, as funny as it sounded, I was the youngest person to train in Innovate Clear.</p><p><br></p><p>Today we were invited to Ukioe Town by Nurarihyon. From what I found out, there have been attacks in Kyoto.</p><p><br></p><p>Rikuo and the others had gone to Kyoto to help their friend.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe Nurarihyon wanted to talk about the situation. Kuroka will be arriving too while Shirone will be staying at our base to stay away from the chaos. She was too young to participate against the likes of Hagoromo Gitsune.</p><p><br></p><p>This problem was much worse than I had anticipated at first.</p><p><br></p><p>The thing was that around three months ago, I had leaked the information about the experiments done on Akira and other similar test subjects by the Naberius House. The information was spread throughout the Underworld and even among the other factions. That had caused a massive and I mean absolutely <em>massive</em> uproar.</p><p><br></p><p>The best part was that some of the or rather a number of the traditionalist(read bigotted) devils still blamed Akira after the reveal and some of the idiotic newcommers actually kidnapped several youkai and forced them into their peerages. This blew the matter out of proportion. It was because this matter attracted the ire of several other smaller factions as well rather than just the Youkai who were afraid that they could be the next one in the line. Now one or two small factions wouldn’t make the devils sweat but more than a few… that made even them sweat because they knew that they <em>did</em> shit on many people in the last five hundred years due to the Evil Piece System.</p><p><br></p><p>Serafall was running around day and night to clean up the mess but the Youkai demanded the members of their race to be released and the traditionalists and the ones who had forced them were explicitly against such a thing as it would set a bad example and show that the Devils are bowing to the other factions, especially one as weak as the Youkai.</p><p><br></p><p>Some even made such comments on the Devil Media and the Devil.Net.</p><p><br></p><p>And that was it. Several Youkai went ahead and tore apart several devils in Japan. Seventeen High Class Devils were killed.</p><p><br></p><p>It was almost a war-like situation. And neither the Devils or any of the three factions could afford a war.</p><p><br></p><p>I heard that Azazel and Michael also put some pressure on the Devils.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally Amaterasu, Sun Wukong and several others had a meeting with Sirzechs and Serafall. The Devil Faction was forced to agree to some demands. First, the ones who were forced into peerages will be freed. As a middle ground, this would be carried out by making them independent devils. They can make contracts on their own and advance in society as well as keep contact with their own families. The ones who had forced them will be banned from the Rating Games for the next five hundred years. Second, the Devils will be forbidden from entering Japan and China for a certain period without any express permission. This was done for the safety of both sides. Last but not the least, Akira was asked to be acquitted of his criminal charges.</p><p><br></p><p>There were obviously severe negotiations but this was the final result.</p><p><br></p><p>Sirzechs had to put his foot down against the old traditionalists and Ajuka in a rare show of force supported him. I believe his exact words were, “If you fight this war, we will not take any part in it.” That quickly calmed everyone down because no matter how much they tried to show it, those old coots knew why they could get away with so much in the first place.</p><p><br></p><p>It was as if the ketchup-head somehow grew a pair from somewhere.</p><p><br></p><p>There were obviously some background deals going on but things were still very tense in the underworld.</p><p><br></p><p>The saving grace in all this was that the Youkai leaders talked to Akame she was actually happy with Rias which assuaged their worries somehow.</p><p><br></p><p>It still worked the way I wanted it to. By creating a chink in the already strained relationship between the New Satans and the Great King Faction.</p><p><br></p><p>I will have to work on that chink over a period of time.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked to my side.</p><p><br></p><p>Vienna was sleeping and drooling from the corner of her mouth and Gretel was hugging my arm.</p><p><br></p><p>I won't lie but she has grown into a very beautiful girl. Due to our training inside Innovate Clear's dimension, she aged and was now eighteen… and by the Satans, is she beautiful. I personally haven't seen Grayfia Lucifuge outside of pictures or videos and I can say it without a doubt that my Gretel was beyond her in every aspect. Be it strength or beauty, Gretel surpassed her completely.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at her sleeping face and took a strand of hair and tucked it behind her ear.</p><p><br></p><p>Things had changed or rather were changing between us.</p><p><br></p><p>It started with my meeting with Ophelia.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Flashback -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I sat before Ophelia who looked at me with an emotionless expression on her face.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Master, am I allowed to do something if you don't mind?\"</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at her and nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>She walked up to me and did the last thing I had expected to happen to me. In fact it was so unbelievable that I was unable to react even after seeing the action in my Observation Haki.</p><p><br></p><p>Slap.</p><p><br></p><p>She slapped me. It took me a moment to realize what had happened.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Why are you doing this to yourself, Damien?\" She asked.</p><p><br></p><p>I was still out of it.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Why are you pushing everyone away? People worrying about you, loving you doesn't mean they need professional help. It just means that they care for you. Why are you so afraid of accepting their love and care? You need help. The place you were raised in could make well off adults go crazy and you went through all that. Losing your mother-figure, finding out that the person you hated the most was protecting you all from the beginning and then even losing them. Such things… such things leave scars Damien. Right now you are projecting the ones you have lost on Gretel. Get a hold of yourself. Gretel is fine. That's the normal reaction anyone would have if the person closest to them is in danger.\"</p><p><br></p><p>I listened to her quietly.</p><p><br></p><p>Was I really scared? Did I need help?</p><p><br></p><p>She cupped my face and made me look towards her and by instinct my Prince of Lies and Observation Haki peered into her to seek out any trace of deception or manipulation in her words. I found none. She was not lying. Did I really need help?</p><p><br></p><p>\"Talk to me, talk to anyone you feel comfortable with. It is not normal for someone to take everything on themselves. It's not good for your mental health. I understand the need for it and that's why I didn't stop you but try to get some help. What's the use of getting your goals just to end up reaching there broken and empty, all alone? That's not a life we ever want for you.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"But they…\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"They will be fine. Just tell me something, did I ever tell you that Gretel was relapsing or was becoming worse?\"</p><p><br></p><p>I shook my head.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Then why do you think her worrying about you, hugging you and crying is something wrong. You once said that you want her to be able to make her own decisions, to choose her own future without any kind of bias. I understand your reason and I respect you for thinking so much about her but… She chose you. Even in her unbiased opinion, she loves you.\"</p><p><br></p><p>She took a breath and continued. \"One of the main reasons for her lack of confidence was the fact that you have been keeping her at arm's length all this time. She was feeling as if she's not worthy of you, as if she was tainted in some way due to the actions of Euclid and that's why you weren't accepting her. It started being cleared after you started to sleep with her and Vienna in the same room and started initiating physical gestures. I left it for that reason because you had enough on your plate as it is and then you both were sorting out your problems yourself. Later on  I  even understood your reasons but this time… you are going too far. Do you not like her?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I… \" I found myself at a loss of words. Did I like Gretel? Obviously I did. Was it love though? I don’t know. What was love even like dammit? This was so confusing.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is it? Do you like her or are just just leading her on?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I would never…”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then what is the problem? Are you afraid to form any new bonds, confirm those feelings? Is this because of Aria, the day you opened your thoughts, she died.”<br><br></p><p>My fists clenched. “This is not about Aria.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No this is not. This is about you. So face it already. Are you afraid that if you bring those words to your lips again, if you confess to your feelings, you will lose them? The world is not out to kill all your loved ones, Damien. Aria’s situation was different. You read her letter. She didn’t want you to blame yourself. Had you not been there, she would have done the same thing. So stop blaming yourself.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Flashback End -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Her words hit me hard.</p><p><br></p><p>I have taken some sessions with her since then and it has helped. Later on I found out that it was actually Merlin who had put her to it… Because Sean was quite worried about me.</p><p><br></p><p>Those guys…</p><p><br></p><p>They can be such…</p><p><br></p><p>I shook my head but I was pretty sure I had a smile on my face.</p><p><br></p><p>My movements woke Gretel up and she looked at me. “Master, you’re awake.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Let me get ready.” She started to get up but I held her back.</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s fine. Just stay with me for a while.”</p><p><br></p><p>Her cheeks blushed a little but she lay down beside me and I held her closer to my chest.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe those idiots did have a point.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Scene Change -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“So, where are we going?” I asked, looking around the area. Kyoto looked so… dark.</p><p><br></p><p>“You will see in a while.” the weird headed Youkai answered as he led the way</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka, Magari and a cloaked member followed behind us.</p><p><br></p><p>When we got to Ukioe town, Nurarihyon asked us to come for a walk with him. Shirone was sent back to our base with Musashi and Gretel. It would attract too much attention with more people.</p><p><br></p><p>“Kyoto looks like it’s dead. Was this done by Hagoromo Gitsune?” Kuroka asked, looking at the scenes around the abandoned streets.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hagoromo Gitsune gets more powerful by absorbing the negative feelings in the air. Fear, pain, terror, anger and despair all make her stronger and thus her Ayakashi are causing terror in the city to make her stronger.” Magari explained to her apprentice.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am still surprised that even after all this, the Shinto Deities haven’t interfered.” I said.</p><p><br></p><p>“They want us to solve the crisis by ourselves because this is a Youkai matter.” Magari replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is that why Yasaka is not interfering? Because she is Amaterasu’s Miko? I thought that she was supposed to be in-charge of the Kyoto Youkai.” I asked Nurarihyon who just nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“There… have been some problems. You will see soon.”</p><p><br></p><p>And see soon I did.</p><p><br></p><p>We entered the area with the patrols of several Youkai, both old and young. They tensed sensing our presence but soon calmed down as soon as they saw Nurarihyon and Magari.</p><p><br></p><p>I did observe them throwing looks at Kuroka and distrustful to downright hostile looks towards our last member and me. Ah, the devil crisis.</p><p><br></p><p>A Tengu came forward to meet the group.</p><p><br></p><p>“Nurari-sama, Magari-sama. Welcome. I apologize for not being able to give you a proper welcome due to our current circumstances. Although, I will have to ask why you brought someone like them.” He pointed towards our last member and me. “You already know the current relations with the Devils. In fact we are sure that there are some Devil supporting Hagoromo Gitsune’s forces. Some of our forces observed them among her numbers.” He said looking at me warily as if I would snap and attack them at any moment.</p><p><br></p><p>“These people have my full trust. I vouch for them.” Nurarihyon stood in front of us.</p><p><br></p><p>The tengu in question looked conflicted but nodded and Nurarihyon continued.</p><p><br></p><p>“Trust me. We can help. I have brought them to help us out. They have a way.”</p><p><br></p><p>Magari walked up and vouched too.</p><p><br></p><p>The tengu finally took a step back.</p><p><br></p><p>“Please don’t break our trust, Nurarihyon or I and my entire tribe will swear an eternal enmity with the Nura Clan.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We don’t intend to do so. The things are as tense as they are. We don’t want to cause any more trouble.”</p><p><br></p><p>The tengu led us to the insides of the area where the guards bowed and moved closer to see who we were.</p><p><br></p><p>“How has Yasaka-Hime been?” Nurarihyon asked, confirming my guesses that something had happened to her.</p><p><br></p><p>“She was poisoned. Princess Kunou is also missing. How could we have missed such an obvious threat.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It was not something any of us could have predicted. He was hiding there for hundreds of years and was still loyal to Hagoromo Gitsune and Abe No Seimei. He was…”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the guy for explanations for the last bit of information.</p><p><br></p><p>He signed but explained more. “Yasaka’s husband was a spy from the cult of Seimei. He had been planted there for hundreds of years and had even managed to catch the eyes of Yasaka. He poisoned her. His actual aim was to use her body to provide a stronger vessel for Hagoromo Gitsune to reincarnate but apparently they already chose a different body for her so they decided to take her out. She defended herself but the overexhaustion caused her to go into a comatose state while the traitor took his own daughter hostage to keep anyone from attacking him.”</p><p><br></p><p>… What the fuck?</p><p><br></p><p>Is that why Yasaka didn’t have a husband?</p><p><br></p><p>Now that I think about it, it was quite weird that someone like her husband would simply die or never even be talked about.</p><p><br></p><p>If he was a traitor though… it would make sense that he was not brought up to poke at unpleasant memories.</p><p><br></p><p>We soon reached the shrine where the tengu went ahead and talked to the guards about something who looked at us before moving to the side, granting us a passage inside.</p><p><br></p><p>Inside the room, there were several people tending to a woman in the center of the room who seemed like she was asleep.</p><p><br></p><p>The tengu looked at us and Nurarihyon looked at both Magari and Kuroka.</p><p><br></p><p>Magari looked at Kuroka and nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>The teacher-student pair walked to the woman while the people moved to the side and let the two work.</p><p><br></p><p>Nature Energy started gathering as if a hurricane around Kuroka as seven tails popped out of her backside, finally attracting the attention of the people. With her training under Sun Wukong, she had reigned her Senjutsu in so well that not a hint of her power was visible for others to see. I saw it for the first time in a while and it seems that Vienna might need more dedicated training to keep up with her old rival. She was borderline Satan Class, not a Peak Ultimate.</p><p><br></p><p>The pair worked continuously to remove the poison and awaken the Nine Tailed Fox from her slumber.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Scene Change -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>It would take some time for Magari and Kuroka to work so Nurarihyon brought me out with him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Would you accompany this old man to meet someone?” He asked, looking towards the castle in the distance.</p><p><br></p><p>“Meeting an old enemy?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Enemies and allies are decided by circumstances more often than not. Hagoromo Gitsune wasn’t always such an Ayakashi. She has in her long lifespan lived as many famous personages and was once in love with a human which bore her a child called Abe No Seimei. She had once dreamed of a world where both Humans and Ayakashi could live together and had even worked towards it with Seimei… well, that was until human greed ruined it all. But that is a long story. Despite her flaws, she cares for her Kyoto Youkai. I want to talk to her once and see if this can be solved without a fight. If the devils are truly involved…”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will make sure it will be the last thing they ever do.” I answered as the two of us walked towards the castle in the distance in silence.</p><p><br></p><p>Nurarihyon’s fear wrapped around him as it hid him from the view of others.</p><p><br></p><p>I watched and analysed it. My Archmage, now strengthened by the healed soul of mine, trying its best to copy the technique and although not a perfect copy, I managed to get something of a make-do job, earning a raised eyebrow from the Youkai to which I just shrugged my shoulders. Using it for a few minutes, I realised that I would be better off using my own Illusions which I did right under Nurarihyon’s technique. It was still a novelty to copy the old youkai’s signature technique. It could maybe be of use someday.</p><p><br></p><p>We walked into the castle undetected. It was only till the last room where spears were thrown towards Nurarihyon who defended against them using his sword. As for me, I simply walked towards the side.</p><p><br></p><p>The door crashed and behind it was the black haired woman with nine white fox tails swinging from side to side as she watched Nurarihyon with rage in her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>I in the meanwhile took the opportunity to search for the devils in the castle and I did find some signals near the lower floors. I left a shadow clone in place to look over Nurarihyon and walked towards the room where I detected the signals.</p><p><br></p><p>The room was on the lower floors, near the basements. I could hear the shouts from outside it.</p><p><br></p><p>“Why can’t we just take the brat. It was our price for the cooperation. Are you trying to back out from your deal?” I heard a shout.</p><p><br></p><p>“The deal was for Nue-sama to be born. We keep our deal when that is complete.” A different voice answered.</p><p><br></p><p>The people were under my illusion and wouldn’t even know if a bomb blasted beside them.</p><p><br></p><p>I unlocked the door with magic and walked past the youkai standing in front of the door.</p><p><br></p><p>Inside the room stood a devil. I recognized him. This guy was the Naberius Head who was under the most shit recently due to his actions and he was not alone.</p><p><br></p><p>There was another devil, a famous one at that.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the Top Ten Rating Game Players and another of the King Piece users, Lord Purson. His son was one of the idiots who got banned from the Rating Games due to the Youkai fiasco.</p><p><br></p><p>I had honestly thought that this would have been the conspiracy of the Old Satan Faction but it seems that it was not the case.</p><p><br></p><p>I even found out who the so-called brat was. In the corner of the room, lay a sleeping child with nine golden tails around her.</p><p><br></p><p>So was the fucker near the door, Yasaka’s husband?</p><p><br></p><p>I might have struck gold.</p><p><br></p><p>I listened to their talks and got some information like Nue’s plans might be different from Hagoromo Gitsune and that the devils and the youkai were planning to betray each other at a crucial time, but it was time to wrap things up. Nurarihyon was fighting Hagoromo Gitsune and the fight was getting bad.</p><p><br></p><p>It didn’t take any time for me to subdue all three of them in an instant. A simple overpowered sleep spell with some magical bindings and they fell on the floor like puppets with their strings cut.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at Kunou who was sleeping and was actually alright. I created two shadow clones.</p><p><br></p><p>I picked her up while my Shadow Clones transferred the Devils away. They would help me know about the devil’s side of things. The other Shadow Clone grabbed the traitor and waited outside.</p><p><br></p><p>I went ahead to check on Nurarihyon who was now breathing heavily after the fight. My Shadow Clone didn’t get any opportunity to interfere because he didn’t need it yet but he might need it soon. I however decided to stop the fight because it would attract even more attention.</p><p><br></p><p>I walked before Hagoromo Gitsune and picked her up by her neck and let my Illusion disperse. The stunned Nine Tailed Fox was too shocked to even resist what was happening.</p><p><br></p><p>But as soon as she did, she started to use everything she could to get free from my grip.</p><p><br></p><p>It was all for naught however. Future Sight + Archmage + Worthless made it so that I could foresee and analyse any of her moves and make it useless even before she completed the spell. It only resulted in her thrashing around like a fish out of the water, uselessly without even being able to do anything. Her tails attacked me and the castle ground below us, tearing concrete as though cardboard but unable to move my Armament Haki covered body.</p><p><br></p><p>“Would you please stop destroying historical landmarks? I have promised a good friend of mine a date in the city. She would be very sad if this castle is destroyed. So, here we only have two choices. First, you, be calm and listen to what the old guy here has to say. Second… violent decapitation. The choice is yours. Oh, and did I add that I can not only kill you but wipe out every trace of your soul so that you don’t ever get to reincarnate again? Now choose.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked back at the open-mouthed Nurarihyon who looked surprised beyond his mind. “Your turn. Speak. I need to go back early for dinner. Let’s get this over with quickly.”</p><p><br></p><p>I dropped her to the ground and as expected she tried to attack me but was pushed into the ground by a concentrated Conqueror's Haki attack.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Last chance.\" I sat down.</p><p><br></p><p>Fear and Haki are forces that more or less counteract each other. If the Haki is stronger then it overpowers Fear and if the Fear is stronger, it overpowers Haki, but… between her fear and my Haki… it wasn't even a question of any comparison.</p><p><br></p><p>She stared at me but didn't attack anymore.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally Nurarihyon got out of his trance and looked towards Hagoromo Gitsune who was still staring at me.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hagoromo Gitsune, stop this war. It will cause our entire kind to suffer. Things have changed a lot in the last four hundred years. These things will only make matters worse. I know that you don't desire the destruction of the Ayakashi and Youkai either. Our enmity was due to Yōhime. It is something between you and me. End this with just the two of us.\" He tried to reason. </p><p><br></p><p>The woman however hissed in reply. Seriously I didn't know that Foxes could hiss like that. \"And forget everything. Forget you killing me? Forget you ruining my Nue's birth? Don't joke around. My Nue would have brought a new era for the Youkai. An era where we didn't need to fear and hide in cowardice. An era where no one would look down on us. My Youkai wouldn't be hunted by those selfish humans, chased around for their hearts or treated as lowly beasts.\" She then looked towards me. \"And yet again you come to ruin everything.\"</p><p><br></p><p>I raised an eyebrow. \"Me, I am just following the old man on a walk. I would kill you if you become troublesome though. But I just heard something interesting so I'll have to ask. Why are you going so far? I know you have some issues with humans. Trust me, most of the races do. It's nothing new. But that doesn't mean that the entire race deserves to die. There are bad apples everywhere. Youkai have it. Devils have it. Even those holier than thou Angels have it. So… . what makes you think you have any right to judge?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"They are greedy, abhorrent creatures. I have lived among humans for centuries. Living different lives, from normal peasants to  heroic samurai and yet in every such life, all I saw was hatred and betrayal. I have lived as Tomoe Gozen, loved a human, married and gave birth to my son, fought wars for the Genji and yet… and yet when my husband's use was over, they turned on my husband and killed him. I still gave them a chance. I went away to live a life of seclusion while my son tried to change things from the inside, to create an era where both humans and youkai can live peacefully together. And yet again, they destroyed everything. They belong to no one. They will always be a cause of strife. The only way to stop that is by the Youkai taking control of everything.\"</p><p><br></p><p>I listened to her with my Prince of Lies and found out that she truly believed it and let out a sigh. \"You really think that things will change by the Youkai taking control? You think that Youkai cannot betray each other?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"My people will never betray me.\"</p><p><br></p><p>That line made me stop.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hehe… . Hehehe Hahaha that's the funniest thing I have heard in a long time. Even the Father of Angels never claimed that his people would never betray him and you…. you a little… . newborn claim of such a thing. Truly delusions have no bounds.\"</p><p><br></p><p>She bristled at my comments, her pride being hurt.</p><p><br></p><p>\"It might not be a concept you people of the three factions might understand, your entire being is based on backstabbing and treachery but I trust my own people. They have worked for hundreds of years to bring me back, serve me even in death. They will never betray me.\"</p><p><br></p><p>My eyes narrowed a bit and then a thought came to my mind. \"Then how about a deal?\"</p><p><br></p><p>Both the youkai looked at me but I just stared at the woman in front of me.</p><p><br></p><p>I continued. “I will not kill you or even interfere in this…. Whatever this is that you are doing, but in return, if you are betrayed by your….hmm, subordinates would be too easy, how about it, if you get betrayed by your son, you will become my servant, mind, body, heart and soul. You however cannot tell Nue or anyone else about this deal in any way at all. This is a chance that I am giving you to see for yourself how foolish your thoughts are….do you have what it takes to take it? Do you have the courage to make a Deal with the Devil?” I gave her my hand for a handshake.</p><p><br></p><p>“Damien!” Nurarihyon shouted, surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>“I made my decision, Nurarihyon. Trust me on this. People with hopes and dreams keep on moving forward, no matter how stupid or delusional they are. If you want to show them the error of their ways, you have to bash their heads in their dreams until they wake up from their delusions. Let her wake up from her delusions and then work to repent for all her mistakes. So, do we have a deal?” I asked the woman again who looked at me to see if I was joking.</p><p><br></p><p>A moment later, she took my hand and the deal was made.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Scene Change -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>“You were too hasty, Damien. Do you think it was wise to let that woman get away so easily?” Nurarihyon said as we were on our way back to Yasaka’s place.</p><p><br></p><p>“I could have killed her, erased her even but what next? Her people would have fled everywhere. Nue would have found one way or another to come back. At best we would have pushed the war to a later date, not avoid it completely. Let’s use this opportunity to show the ways of the world to the younger generation, make them realise just what kind of world we live in. The Devils were behind the incident as reported by Yasaka’s people. They were from the Great King Faction but I will tell you the information that I get from them. Do you think they will just give up after this? Prepare the kids. I have a feeling that the world will be changing and change….is never peaceful.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you planning to cause a war?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Obviously not. War is the last thing I would ever want. I am just telling you about my thoughts. People are starting to move all over the world. Something is causing ripples and in time these ripples might become waves that could drown everything. I’d rather my allies learn to swim in a relatively fast river than drown in the tsunami. As for Hagoromo Gitsune….I promised that I would not interfere and I am the Devil of my word. I will not break it…. but I never said anything about my subordinates. If anything gets out of hand, I will send my best people to bring the matter under control and end this whole fiasco entirely.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So it was really devils behind this.” He sighed.</p><p><br></p><p>“It was obvious that they would make some moves. This was probably the first time they ever faced any kind of backlash from their peerage shenanigans. It would be surprising if they didn’t make any moves at all. You however can’t put the whole blame on the devil side for this. At best they provided a way for Hagoromo Gitsune to regain her strength faster and disable Yasaka’s guards. Her people were already planning to make some moves. They just did things more easily due to the help.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you find someone from their side?” He asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yasaka’s ex-husband or rather soon to be ex-husband. He was holding her child in a basement floor and was apparently making a deal with the Naberius Head to trade the child for their help. I subdued them all and sent them ahead with the child to Yasaka’s place. What do you think I was doing when you both were fighting? By the way, do you think she will be able to control the Leylines?”</p><p><br></p><p>The man took a few seconds to digest the news and then answered. “No. The Leylines have a seal in the castle. As long as she stays there, Yasaka cannot gain control of the Leylines. Moreover, I don’t think she will recover so soon. While Kuroka’s help will be good, it will still take her some time to recover.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Can she control the Leylines?” I asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Not really. In her current situation, she cannot. She wants to give birth to Nue and the energies of the world will be harmful to a being being reincarnated from Yomi. She will not risk such a thing. It was one of the reasons why I was able to defeat her so easily, the last time. She was protecting her child.” He answered.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, too bad her child has been plotting against her all this time.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Nue has been plotting against her all this time. Why do you think I made such a deal?”</p><p><br></p><p>I didn’t say anything and walked ahead, giving the stunned ayakashi some time to collect himself….once again.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Scene Change -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>A week had passed since that meeting.</p><p><br></p><p>The prisoners had been talking properly in our dungeons. I gained good information about the inner workings of the Great King Faction and some of the more well-kept secrets.</p><p><br></p><p>Yasaka’s now ex-husband was handed over to the woman after she woke up. She personally tortured and extracted infromation from him, amd then ripped the idiot’s head off with her bare hands.</p><p><br></p><p>She thanked me for the cooperation and then Nurarihyon went ahead to explain my situation to her. Who I was, my relation with Kuroka and why Sirzechs was being so cooperative.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroka’s status as the newest sage also helped but the turning point was our last member. With his eight tails out Akira removed his cloak and greeted Yasaka. The cloak was enchanted by Merlin to hide the user so they didn’t know of his identity yet.</p><p><br></p><p>I gave Akira a chakra fruit too and he had consumed it after the first meeting with his sister. Kuroka had instructed the guy in the Sage Arts training she was receiving from Sun Wukong through me and he instantly gained another pair of tails from the chakra fruit. The last tail was gained when he controlled his power more. He was stronger than Kuroka because he was using the Innovate Clear’s Dimension and could spend more time in training. His Demonic Power had also increased a lot, making the guy a solid Satan Class in terms of strength.</p><p><br></p><p>He had explained the circumstances of his escape and rescue by me and his life until now. Nothing in details about how he became stronger but just that it was not from the experiments and because of my support. It was enough to get Yasaka hooked for now and for her to sign an alliance with me like Nurarihyon.</p><p><br></p><p>She offered to teach Akira the skills of a Nine Tailed Fox since it looked as if he would become one soon enough. I accepted it because the Fox Fire of a Nine Tailed Fox was said to rival the Black Flames of the Prison Dragon King, Vritra. Moreover there were several other Youkai specific techniques that I had no idea about. We decided to keep his identity and presence here a secret though. At least until he was strong enough to be a deterrence on his own.</p><p><br></p><p>Although I believe that rescuing Kunou was the best part.</p><p><br></p><p>I also found out why Kunou never remembered much about her father.</p><p><br></p><p>Yasaka personally erased her memory because the girl was traumatised and couldn’t even sleep properly.</p><p><br></p><p>In the meantime, Rikuo had entered Kyoto with his followers to assist his friend.</p><p><br></p><p>They were met with a harsh attack at the start and Kuroka had to step in and assist them to get away with their lives.</p><p><br></p><p>The kids had been running around and fighting since then while their enemies were breaking the seal on Kyoto for Hagoromo Gitsune to be able to give birth to Nue.</p><p><br></p><p>Things were starting to become interesting.</p><p><br></p><p>The Youkai under Yasaka didn’t make any moves yet and she didn’t ask me for any assistance either. She was of the view that the Youkai should solve this problem by themselves. They wouldn’t be able to raise their heads in front of the other factions if they had to call for assistance in such a matter, especially the devils.</p><p><br></p><p>It went along with everything I had planned so it was not a problem for me.</p><p><br></p><p>Now I only had to wait for things to reach the climax.</p><p><br></p><p>_______________________________________x___________________________________________________________________________x____________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: LuluViBritania(FF.N, SB and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>We are in the Kyoto Youkai Arc.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I had initially thought of making Damien participate in the events of the arc more closely but then realised the problem.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Damien is too strong.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>He could solo all of Hagoromo Gitsune’s forces and Nue all on his own.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Moreover, it wouldn’t do well for him to fight the battle for his allies. So this was the way I changed the arc.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Now I am addressing some questions that people might have about this chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why isn’t Damien spending more time in the Innovate Clear dimension?</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>That training in seclusion thing of the wuxia novels, is not really a boon for someone’s mental health(As evident by the fact that all those idiots become mindless murderers). Damien realised that he needed help and took it. He is plenty strong and can fight a Super Devil easily. No need to go all cultivation shit on his ass.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>There was also the part about the memories of Lucifer. When continuously being fed with memories of another person, someone might have an identity crisis. Secluding oneself at such a time doesn’t exactly help.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Power comes at a price after all.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am not saying that Damien will become someone else because of it or have a drastic personality change but watching or rather experiencing someone’s entire life from up close, especially someone like Lucifer’s does bring some changes in someone’s thought process. It will help him get another perspective and understand Lucifer as a character. </strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The background about Tomoe Gozen is something from the Nurarihyon Wiki page and not an asspull from me. It just said that she once lived as Tomoe Gozen so I used the Fate Lore to complete the story. It suited the theme quite a lot. Just had to change the Oni to a Nine Tailed Fox, so don’t go shouting at me that Tomoe Gozen was an Oni and not a Kyubi.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>I am pretty fucking sure 99% of people didn’t even know who she was before watching Fate.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The thing about the news reveal and the reactions. Why was Sirzechs acting like that and it was very out of character?</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>There were many small things going on in the background. I’ll explain their end of the situation too. It was not only because of Damien. In fact Damien’s presence only made a small impact on the decision.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Butterflies started flapping their wings and it would be dumb if the storms only formed where Damien could see of understand it.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>We have to remember that the Devil faction doesn’t have only one enemy.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Anyways, this is it for now.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br></p>",

It was the place where I was brought to get my Essences from that Devil.</p><p><br></p><p>\"How rude. I am not a devil, you know. And even if I was, it would be the pot calling the kettle black, right?\" I heard a voice behind me and snapped to look in the direction of the voice.</p><p><br></p><p>\"YOU… .! \" I didn't think I would have snarled like this at anyone.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hey there, getting a lot of hostility from someone who saved your ass.\" That green eyed devil smirked.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Which wouldn't have been needed had your Essences worked properly.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"My Essences are working perfectly fine, thank you. It was you who was in a hurry and didn't even ask for the instructions.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"How were they working fine? The Blank Essence was supposed to make me have no limits. My soul wasn't supposed to be damaged in the first place.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Yes, that's true. It's just too bad that you drank it at the end, everything was already done by then. I remember there being a saying about haste making waste and what not.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"You could have told me.\" I gritted my teeth.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I could have but… . You didn't ask me… . And… . \" An unholy amount of power weighed down on me, \"I am not your servant.\"</p><p><br></p><p>The pressure disappeared, just as abruptly as it had appeared. \"Now that the pleasantries are over, shall we get back to the more important talk?\"</p><p><br></p><p>I took a deep breath and nodded at him. It was hard to not snap at someone who was basically the cause of me being in that hellhole in the first place.</p><p><br></p><p>\"So you might have already found out about some abnormalities in your soul.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Understatement of the fucking year.</p><p><br></p><p>\"You see, the thing is that your soul was already quite damaged when we met the first time. My Essences don't do any harm to its users. The reason it did so for you was that you already had a damaged soul and the rapid influx in power was tearing it apart. I had only one way to fix it. Fuse your soul with someone else's soul. Growing a soul was more effort than I was willing to make. The only non divine soul I found that could support the power was Lucifer's. Actually there were a few others but this one seemed the most interesting to use and was the best match.\"</p><p><br></p><p>I am pretty sure that I had my jaws open by now. I couldn't detect any lie from his statements. Then again I doubted any power would work on this guy. That show of strength a while ago was something beyond anything I had felt before. My consciousness kept the infinite willpower at bay and could understand how vast the power scales in the world truly can be and yet this guy seemed to have dwarfed all of those with his mere presence. Such a man wouldn't have any need to lie to me and even if he did, not that I could do anything about it anyway. </p><p><br></p><p>\"You see, Lucifer was made by the God of the Bible in that world and thus when you touched the True Longinus, it led to the power inside it to mend some of the damage and repair a part of your soul or rather merge the two parts better. Lucifer had already lost most of his consciousness and all that's left are fragments of his memories. The merger will give you those as well as his powers. As for the Spirit of the God of the Bible, you can meet him after you get a part of the energies from all five holy relics. The Big Guy had a message for Lucifer. You will gain the memories of Lucifer yourself and can decide what you want to do later on. Collecting the energies is however important because that's the fastest method to heal your soul. Any questions now?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Why would The God of the Bible's energy not harm me?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"That's for me to know and you to find out. I helped your ass for some entertainment and I am going to get it.”</p><p><br></p><p>I asked him some more questions I had about the Essences as why couldn’t I just produce Ki and other sources of energy.</p><p><br></p><p>That was simply because he wanted entertainment and that would be contrary to it. Such an utter BS reason. He did say that I would get almost full access to the Essences when I am completely healed or when the souls finally merge. Until then Essences will be weAkamed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Now off you go. I am a busy man.\"</p><p><br></p><p>The light flashed before my eyes and the room disappeared. I don't know if he heard my 'Thank You' before I left. Despite his reasons, the guy did save my life.</p><p><br></p><p>I might be angry but I knew that I owed my life to him, no matter how the start had been. I mean I wouldn't even have a life without his help in the first place.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Scene Change -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I opened my eyes to see Gretel sitting by my bedside and Vienna snuggled on my other side.</p><p><br></p><p>Vienna was asleep but Gretel noticed my awakening and looked at me.</p><p><br></p><p>“Master.” her voice was a bit hoarse. Was she crying all this time?</p><p><br></p><p>“Good Morning. How long have I been asleep?” I asked, trying to get to know about the situation first.</p><p><br></p><p>She however didn’t answer but hugged me tightly.</p><p><br></p><p>He could feel her quivering and put an arm around her, pulling her onto the bed, into a hug. I could feel the wetness from her face, her tears streaming down and making my shirt wet.</p><p><br></p><p>I caressed her head softly till she calmed down after a few minutes.</p><p><br></p><p>She still didn’t raise her head but I could hear her stuttering whispers, “I… thought, sorry, I couldn’t. I should’ve…”</p><p><br></p><p>I raised her head towards me and lightly kissed her forehead. “It’s fine. I’m here.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I… I should’ve done more. I didn’t know, Master.” she looked like she would break down again.</p><p><br></p><p>“I didn’t know any better either. You were not at fault, Gretel. Don’t put yourself down for it. I patted her back and brought her closer in my embrace.</p><p><br></p><p>She calmed down after I reassured her for a few more minutes.</p><p><br></p><p>“How long was I asleep?” I asked her after she calmed down a bit more.</p><p><br></p><p>“Two days. Merlin and Lady Helena checked up on you as well as the doctors we could bring. They said that you were safe and were probably exhausted from whatever happened.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I see.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Miss Vienna didn’t leave your side and we didn’t inform Miss Kuroka because she would have been worried. It was Merlin’s decision. Sean was quite worried and I think he was blaming himself.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It was no one’s fault. I went ahead and touched something that was basically the highest poison for Devil kind. It was stupid of me. Furthermore, I don’t think anything bad happened. If anything, I feel much better now than I did before.” And I did. I took a few moments to check myself and the changes were huge. I guess he wasn’t lying about my soul being healed by the Holy Energy. My demonic power had more than doubled. I was almost one and a half times as strong as a Satan and slightly below Azazel’s level with the recent training but this one boosted my power to almost as strong as four times what Serafall was and slightly more than twice as strong as Azazel. And that was Demonic Power alone. I also gained two empty slots of the Binder’s Essence because my soul was much better than before and I think I could take one or two more rounds of Divide. I think that my Haki had improved too, being related to spirit and all, but I needed to check on my Conqueror’s when I was away from others. As for my other powers, I would need to check on them as well.</p><p><br></p><p>To be honest, I am kinda glad she is behaving like this. In this short period of time, she had actually disobeyed my order and done what she wanted to do. I am actually quite happy.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Dummy.\" My little gremlin snuggled into my back, murmuring in her sleep.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn't get up and let the two girls rest snuggling onto me.</p><p><br></p><p>They must have been really scared with the events which took over the last two days. </p><p><br></p><p>The girl was probably too exhausted emotionally and fell asleep but I think I heard her whisper, “Please don’t leave me, Master.”</p><p><br></p><p>I tightened my grip more.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Scene Change -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The room was full of my close subordinates. They had all gathered on hearing that I had woken up. The two Nekoshou sisters however couldn't make it as they were training with their respective teachers so I didn't disturb them.</p><p><br></p><p>\"So let me get this straight. You somehow gained powers from the True Longinus, the one thing that couldn't be further from your existence and now want to see if the same can happen with the other holy relics.\" Merlin summarized.</p><p><br></p><p>I nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>\"My apologies, Boss but… Are you freaking mad?\" Sean shouted out loudly.</p><p><br></p><p>I let out a sigh.</p><p><br></p><p>\"It's… hard to explain. Trust me on this one. It didn't mean any harm. In fact, let me take one more look at it.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone tensed at my words and only Merlin looked a bit thoughtful.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Actually, let's do just that. Give him the spear, Sean.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"NO. No one will bring that damned spear anywhere near Dummy.\" Vienna stood between us extremely agitated.</p><p><br></p><p>I spied that Gretel looked like she was ready to cover me in the mists of the Dimension Lost to protect me.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Have some faith in me. I don't enjoy self mutilation. The energy will not hurt me. I think that <em>He</em> was trying to talk to me but the power was not enough for his will to convey the message. Despite everything, do remember that he was the one who made Lucifer. He was the source. If anything happens, I will be prepared too.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Almost everyone except Merlin were unconvinced and even he was casting every spell he could to momentarily seal the Spear if it showed any reaction.</p><p><br></p><p>It took around one hour to convince all of them to allow me anywhere near the spear. Gretel and Vienna were the most adamant.</p><p><br></p><p>Cleria was trying to use her Worthless to suppress the spear in case anything went wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>Vienna was even trying to use her 'Denial of the Divine' against it at a moment's notice.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, under the spell range of all of them, I touched the Holy Spear once more and it was as if the will inside the spear resonated with my entire soul.</p><p><br></p><p>Words came out of my mouth without me even trying to or understanding what I was saying.</p><p><br></p><p><em>\"The Lord is my God.\"</em></p><p><br></p><p>And it was as if a sense of peace and calm enveloped me.</p><p><br></p><p>I saw the wide eyed looks of the other people and especially Gretel and Vienna.</p><p><br></p><p>All their spells frizzled out as they stated at me in awe and parts terror for some.</p><p><br></p><p>Asia for one was down on her knees, her eyes closed and hands joined in prayer. </p><p><br></p><p>\"What happened, why are you all looking at me like that?\"</p><p><br></p><p>Merkin broke out of his extremely stunned stupor at first and said nothing but created a mirror with a spell in front of me. I narrowed my eyes and walked to the front of the mirror and the spear fell out of my hands. I snapped back quickly to see if it wasn't a joke by Merlil.</p><p><br></p><p>It wasn't.</p><p><br></p><p>On my back now stood twelve silver feathered wings. A total of six pairs each. It was different from any other angel. Only Michael was known to have Golden Wings.</p><p><br></p><p>This… </p><p><br></p><p>\"Interesting. This does require some research.\"</p><p><br></p><p>And that made me realize the situation and my composure broke for the first time in a long while and I shouted.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Fuck your research. Sean, close the link. Take the spear back.\" The guy in question ran to do so and as the spear disappeared, so did the light around me.</p><p><br></p><p>My wings were back to the black devil wings.</p><p><br></p><p>I sat on the ground on my back as everyone ran up to me to check me to see if there was anything wrong with me.</p><p><br></p><p>There wasn't.</p><p><br></p><p>\"You! I told you to keep that spear away? Vienna was about to burst with anger before I brought her into my lap and hugged her, pacifying.</p><p><br></p><p>\"It was an interesting and harmless experiment nonetheless.\" The annoying wizard commented, earning glares from every girl in the room.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Not now Merlin. Having a minor existential crisis over here.\"</p><p><br></p><p>He kept quiet. I think that he noticed that Gretel would have seriously attacked him and this time, she would probably have the help of others too.</p><p><br></p><p>It took some time for us to calm down but we were back in the room.</p><p><br></p><p>\"So… Holy artifacts are somehow not hurting me anymore. At least those connected to <em>him. </em>I would still recommend keeping the spear away from me for the time being. I have no intention of jumping down that rabbithole any time soon. That said, find the other users of the Relics as fast as possible. That might explain the reason behind this.\"</p><p><br></p><p>This was met with agreements from almost everyone in the room.</p><p><br></p><p>It was when Merlin interrupted once more, \"Really? Don't tell me you all didn't notice anything strange just now?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Me changing into a freaking Archangel was plenty strange, Merlin. If some minor things escaped our eyes, it can be excused as a genuine mistake. What did we miss though?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"You were radiating holy aura all over the place yet none of the devils were affected in the slightest. It didn't hurt them.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Did that happen?</p><p><br></p><p>\"Now that you say it, I think I didn't experience any kind of discomfort either.\" Helena replied.</p><p><br></p><p>\"ENOUGH! We are not going to talk about that anymore.\" Vienna got out of my restraint and shouted.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at her and smiled. Her emotions were all over the place, fear covering a large part of it. Me fainting there must have brought out some very unpleasant memories.</p><p><br></p><p>“Shorty calm…”</p><p><br></p><p>“NO NO NO. I don’t want that spear near Dummy again.” she shouted.</p><p><br></p><p>This was probably her first big tantrum but her shaking grip on my arms told me everything I needed to know. I shook my head towards others and they kept quiet too.</p><p><br></p><p>I will have to let Ophelia talk to Vienna and maybe even Gretel after this.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Scene Change -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>It took some time but I managed to put Vienna to sleep and left Gretel to watch over her.</p><p><br></p><p>I returned to the room.</p><p><br></p><p>Only Merlin, Helena, Ophelia, Cleria, Sean and surprisingly Lavinia were present.</p><p><br></p><p>“So… what’s this about?”</p><p><br></p><p>Lavinia spoke up but her tone was a bit off. “I might know the location of one of the Holy Relics.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s with a witch called Augusta.” she said frostily.</p><p><br></p><p>Augusta? Wasn’t it with Walburga or something? It took me a moment to recall that Walburga was Augusta’s student and the Incinerate Anthem was passed onto her when Augusta died.</p><p><br></p><p>Still to verify things.</p><p><br></p><p>“She doesn’t have an apprentice called Walburga, does she?”</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good. Do you know how we can reach her?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t.”</p><p><br></p><p>Then I will have to wait for her to appear. She had appeared to cooperate with the Utsusemi Organisation in the Slash Dog part. I remember that much. I don’t know if such things will still occur but at least something similar might happen considering I have left many things on that part left untouched. I will have to keep a watch till then.</p><p><br></p><p>“Anyone have any ideas on how to find them?”</p><p><br></p><p>“They were on the darker side of the spectrum and live in a private dimension. They rarely are caught outside. It will be hard to get a hand on them. I will ask around in some Magician circles but I don’t expect much.”</p><p><br></p><p>I was trying to avoid the Holy Relics previously except the Sephiroth Graal if possible because I had no idea how they would react to me but now, things have changed.</p><p><br></p><p>“By the way, do you have any connections to the Golden Dawn? I wanted to find the information on one of the students there. Meredith Ordinton. She has a sort of a special identity so it might be a bit problematic if things are done too overtly. I have a few reasons to believe that she might have a Holy Relic as well. Also, please send the people into the Vampire Territory. I want to find out about those Dhampirs. There is a fair chance that the girl has the Sephiroth Graal.”</p><p><br></p><p>“The Vampires don’t allow anyone inside their castles. Even with the current business relations we have with them, I cannot get any of the higher ups to meet me directly most of the time I visit, let alone get them to talk about information like these.Our business links are improving because we are importing a lot of bloodstones from them for our new medications. But that has only made them more arrogant. We need something that would bring them to us instead of the other way around or it will take more time to find what we need.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Why don’t we just go and grab what we want?” Sean asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Vampires might not be the most friendly of the bunch but they have plenty of connections with several factions as the only supplier of Bloodstones. They are politically connected. Moreover the identity of the one Damien wants is a bit complicated. She is the daughter of the King of the Tepes Faction with a Human woman. He basically wants their princess. Kidnapping her is bound to get found out in the future and that would bring a buttload of trouble, not to mention attempts from other factions to do the same to us would then be <em>justifiable</em>. There are some lines you just don’t cross. Thus Boss wants Ophelia to just buy them off if that’s possible or help them make a run for it from where we can pick them up.But what we need to have for that is, their location. Moreover the Vampires are just too vindictive and they might just kill off those targets just out of spite rather than let them fall into our hands.”</p><p><br></p><p>All of these stupid reasons were making me really annoyed.</p><p><br></p><p>“One year. If you can’t make progress within that time, I will go there with Gretel and help them make a run for it myself. I don’t have much leeway now.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What’s the deal with this Meredith kid then?” Sean asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“She might be the bastard daughter of a member of the British Royal family.”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>“Really Boss, are you getting a princess fetish or something?” He looked at me amazed.</p><p><br></p><p>I merely deadpanned at him.</p><p><br></p><p>“That leaves us with only one Relic left. The Shroud of Turin. The Shroud was stored in a Cathedral in Italy and I don’t think normal people are even allowed to see the real things. They only have a replica for the tourists and visitors. The Shroud is guarded by several high ranking members of the Church and only an order from the Pope or Heaven itself can allow someone to see it. And I don’t think any of those two would allow us if we kindly asked.” Merlin completed.</p><p><br></p><p>“We will think of something when the time comes.”</p><p><br></p><p>These things can repair my soul. The thing that has been weighing on my mind since I was born in this world and I am not going to miss this chance.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sean, start mastering the spear. You are probably the best user we can get in the team who can use it. Also keep it slightly away from Vienna and Gretel. My fainting must have brought out some terrible memories. Ophelia, please see that they get those issues resolved soon. Vienna is ten. She might need more help in that regard. Gretel was better than I had expected her to be.”</p><p><br></p><p>I walked to Merlin and touched his forehead, marking him with my Binder’s Mark and giving him the nerfed Archmage Essence, Mad Doctor Essence and Blank Essence. His eyes glazed out for a bit and I felt a chill on my back.</p><p><br></p><p>On a second though, I might have unleashed a completely different kind of monster on this world just by this action.</p><p><br></p><p>I waved it off for the time being and continued, “I have given you a part of my power. You must have already understood how to use them. Since you didn’t want to change into a Devil, this will help you break the ceiling.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I think you misunderstood me, little brother. It’s not that I don’t want to become a devil. I just don’t want to become one under anyone else. If someday you can change me into one, I will agree happily.” He smiled. “But <em>this</em>…. you have been holding out on me. Or is this the new power you got from the True Longinus? If so let’s go and rob the other Holy relics. Heck, I would have robbed the relics of other pantheons for this too. I can definitely understand why you would suddenly want to take such an action now.” He said while forming different types of magic circles and quickly turning them around on his palm.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is my own power. I have had it since birth. I can however only give this to one person in around a year. Some of my subordinates still haven’t gotten this mark yet and will have to wait for the next few years. The Holy Relics are somehow increasing the potency of the overall power. It also has some other powers which only I can use.” I explained to him upfront. He was already sworn to loyalty towards me and he would figure it out on his own. It was better to explain things up front. Merlin is someone I’d rather be as open to as possible.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy kneeled on one knee in front of me. “Then I will prove myself to be worthy of this honour you have given me, My King.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And I expect no less.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Scene Change -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the sheer destruction that I had caused to the area in front of me and let out a breath. The increase in power had been amazing. So much so that my control had become a mess. Although even after the large country sized dimension where Kuroka’s Chakra Fruit was formed initially was now a smouldering crater, I barely felt winded or even had a heavy breath.</p><p><br></p><p>The attacks however were very inefficient. I couldn’t control them as well as I used to. I had gained reasonable control over them in the last week, since the incident but there was still much work to be done. The 88% efficiency was nothing compared to the 97% I had before.</p><p><br></p><p>Merlin on the other hand was like a beast on steroids. He had drowned himself in research and training since he got the Essences. The time dilation in the Innovate Clear Dimension was increased by a fold now. He even managed to incorporate higher gravity in the place which made it a perfect training ground for everyone. The best part was that he could manipulate the environment to attack any and everyone inside the dimension, from a blade of grass to an entire mountain could be used. This was the best possible training for Observation Haki as well as Senjutsu.</p><p><br></p><p>I might have accidentally created a monster but knowing the situation I am in, I cannot afford anything less than this. After all, every Sirzechs needs an Ajuka as a helper.</p><p><br></p><p>If I don't have one, I can just create one for myself.</p><p><br></p><p>The incident seemed to have pushed my entire team into some kind of realisation and they had increased their training by at least a fold. Even the extremely mild-mannered Victoria was going out of her way to train her combat abilities and even joining us in practice.</p><p><br></p><p>The ones who took it the hardest were probably Gretel, Vienna and Kuroka who later found out about what had happened and had drowned herself in further training and most surprisingly Sean.</p><p><br></p><p>The guy never shows it outwards but he is a big softie inside and that incident must have hurt him a bit because he was technically using the spear. He had asked his best buddy Sigurd for help and was offered lessons by Brynhildr in both spearmanship and runes. On second thought, wasn’t that exactly the thing that Scáthach was famous for? He had removed his Sacred Gear before going there for training so as to hide it from Odin or any other Norse God that might take a peak. I want to see how much he can learn from Asgard in his stay there. The Norse runes and Spearmanship are quite good.</p><p><br></p><p>Vienna was bringing Akeno together with her while she trained. Ophelia had calmed her down reasonably but she still refused to leave my side for a few weeks after the incident.</p><p><br></p><p>Gretel on the other hand made even Merlin look like he was lazing around compared to the training she was putting in. She had devoted herself into developing a defensive technique using her Space Manipulation and Dimension Lost that can stop any kind of attack. She wants it to be the first of its kind and her own original technique.</p><p><br></p><p>Apparently my Essences becoming stronger made the Essences of the bound subordinates stronger too.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>“<em>My Lord. There has been progress in our research. We have cracked the Sleeping Disease.”</em></strong> I suddenly heard Helena’s voice sounding through our link.</p><p><br></p><p>“Really? Wonderful. Did you test it on any patients?”</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>“Yes, My Lord. Eleven patients have been checked and we have managed to awaken each one of them.”</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p>“What about her?”</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>“We were waiting for you to arrive before we start anything.”</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p>“Very well, I will arrive there momentarily.</p><p><br></p><p>And I did just that. Informing everyone that our newest member was about to awaken, I teleported us all to the hospital where Ingvild was being kept.</p><p><br></p><p>The hospital staff were moved out to a different wing. The place where we were was warded off properly as a cautionary measure against any panic attacks Ingvild might have.  In terms of Demonic Power she was as strong as Serafall even after just sleeping for a hundred years. That’s not even considering her Sacred Gear and Clan Trait. I bet if I turned her into a full devil and gave her a Binder’s Mark, she would reach the same level as Gretel. A natural born Pseudo Super Devil at the very least. With the nerfed Essences and her other powers, she would easily become a Super Devil. Such a Devil having a panic attack could be pretty dangerous for the surroundings and thus the security.</p><p><br></p><p>Merlin put a ward around the place and I gave Helena a nod to continue with the process.</p><p><br></p><p>She injected some medicine into her arm. There was no reaction for a while but then demonic power began to rise suddenly.</p><p><br></p><p>I threw a few barriers up and Gretel released greyish mist around the place but as soon as the power increased, things calmed down too.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl in question slowly opened her eyes and looked at us in surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hello, Miss Ingvild. Congratulations on being awake again. I believe you have many questions in your mind but let’s put them aside till the doctors check you first.” I was using the Bewitching Voice Trait and the girl nodded. She had woken up after an extremely long time and was probably very disoriented right now. It would be better to let her recover for sometime than spring everything on her right at the start.</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded and Helena took some tests while our group left the building. Merlin had sealed her Sacred Gear and put a small seal over her Demonic Power. Moreover the girl herself didn’t seem trained in Devil Magic either. So Ophelia, Helena and Cleria would be more than enough to keep her under control in case she had a panic attack again.</p><p><br></p><p>The first awakening was dangerous because the medicine temporarily created a massive surge in her demonic power which jolted the patient as some kind of a shock to the soul.</p><p><br></p><p>This was as dangerous as it sounded and the patient had real danger of snapping due to the stress of their souls.</p><p><br></p><p>The girl was asleep while she lost most of her family and I wouldn’t call the last one family though. Normally, she would have rather killed her than let a ‘taint’ on her bloodline survive. She will need long term therapy too. Man, the Supernatural world could solve a lot of troubles if they had decent therapists.</p><p><br></p><p>On the matter of therapy, I recalled something else.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Rias -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Rias stepped inside the building with her Queen following her. She had managed to attract her attention with the information Damien had given her.</p><p><br></p><p>'The Devil always keeps his deal.' The cheeky guy said and she could feel his smirk on the other side of the call.</p><p><br></p><p>Apparently the brother of her Queen was innocent, well kind of. He was being experimented on and the King that was killed was doing some illegal activities.</p><p><br></p><p>Although she couldn’t tell any of it to her brother or any of her family members because she had no proof of it, the information that her brother could be innocent was enough for her new Queen to follow her easily. She had dragged her to the first place she had promised Damien. To a therapist. Although she had to tell her some things that only she and her brother knew to reassure and convince her that she wasn’t tricking her. It was honestly harder to convince her family to allow her to bring her to a therapist but her brother had supported her decision. He had arranged a meeting with the best Psychiatrist in the Underworld, Lady Ophelia Paimon. She was one of the most prominent figures in the underworld regarding mental health due to her Clan Trait, the Bewitching Voice.</p><p><br></p><p>The trait was so influential during the old days that the stories of the devils being able to seduce people to do their bidding came from their Clan Trait.</p><p><br></p><p>The Paimons are also expanding into the medicine industry in the human world. She heard this from Sona that they are a massive hit and had taken the Pharmaceutical industry by storm. Some people thought that she was using magic which was quickly proved to be wrong. It proved to be a simple non-magical type of medicine.</p><p><br></p><p>This led them to think that Lady Paimon got a genius peerage member under herself but she never commented about that.</p><p><br></p><p>Sona's family were even thinking about having a partnership with them in case they were going to expand in the Underworld but they were apparently in contact with the Sallos and the Dantalion and were very chummy with the heiress of the Glasya-Labolas so they are waiting for a right opportunity. Some people even talked about Sona being engaged to Ace Paimon, the younger brother of Lady Ophelia but he was apparently in a relationship already or so the rumours went. Moreover there was a great age difference between the two.</p><p><br></p><p>Also if the rumours were to be believed, Lady Ophelia was seeing someone too and was planning to leave the Lordship of the house to her younger brother quite soon. Her mother had been quite adamant that she remembered everything about the person she was going to meet.</p><p><br></p><p>Ophelia Paimon was one of the most successful businesswomen in the Underworld. She took the Lordship of her House at the age of eighteen after her father passed away in the Civil War and had brought her house to become one of the most financially stable ones. While not exactly Phenex in terms of wealth, she was one of the most well connected people in the Underworld.</p><p><br></p><p>Her mother had asked her to make a good impression on her if possible.</p><p><br>She came here today with Beowulf as a guard for her and her queen.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Miss Rias, this is the office of Lady Ophelia's suggested doctor. He will report the details of little Akame to Lady Ophelia who will then take care of the main therapy. Would you like for me to follow you there?\" Beowulf asked both of them.</p><p><br></p><p>\"No. We will be fine.\" She replied looking at the office in front of her. There was a name tag on the office. Dr. D. L. Cypher.</p><p><br></p><p>\"In that case, I will be waiting outside. Please tell me if you require anything.\"</p><p><br></p><p>She nodded and knocked on the door.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Come in.\"</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at her Queen and nodded before entering the doctor's room.head</p><p><br></p><p>Inside sat a man with Black hair and dark purple eyes, sitting on the other side of the desk. He lifted his head and their eyes locked. \"Sit.\"</p><p><br></p><p>She didn't know why but she felt her heart flutter at the voice.</p><p><br></p><p>She quickly shook his head. Damien was much better.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Yes, what can I do for you?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"My name is Rias Gremory and this is my queen, Akame. We were asked to meet you by Lady Paimon.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Yes, Ophelia did tell me about it. So, this is your Queen.\" They both nodded and he continued. \"Tell me about your experience with your Queen.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Akame is a good person. She is currently depressed because of the incident with her brother so she is not speaking much but I know that she is a very kind person.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Oh, and why is that? I mean there are rumours going around about Youkai being violent and all.\"</p><p><br></p><p>She grit her teeth. \"That is not true. Akame has never done anything to harm me and I am sure she never will.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Are you sure those are not just your inner wishes painting her to you in that colour? I mean she is your Queen, your first peerage member. Your entire view might be jaded for all I know. Are you sure the words you speak are all correct?.\"</p><p><br></p><p>This man… She wanted to punch the guy in the face especially when he had that annoying smirk when asking those questions.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I am not lying. Akame is a very kind person. Anyone else would have left their family to die but she didn't give up on her brother and it's affecting her this much. She is a really caring person and I know it. \" She grit her teeth and replied.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Really?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I do not lie…\" She took a deep breath.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Oh!\"</p><p><br></p><p>She stared right into her eyes. \"I do not lie… that's what humans do.\"</p><p><br></p><p>The man suddenly stopped and started at her with slightly wide eyes and then burst out in a laugh.</p><p><br></p><p>Rias felt her cheeks burn in embarrassment. Dammit, he had looked so cool when he said this.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Oh that's hilarious. I am inclined to claim copyright but it is the truth. But really, that was very well played. Keep this up and I might really fall in love with you, Princess.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Really fall in love… What are you saying? Mind your word... s… Princess! You…\"</p><p><br></p><p>The man in front of her smiled once more before the black hair turned silver white and the purple eyes turned electric blue. The face as well as the entire body of the man changed and in front of her sat Damien Lucifer, The Devil in all his devilish glory. Did he somehow become even more handsome somehow in the time they didn’t meet each other?</p><p><br></p><p>Akame tensed seeing the change so she quickly turned to her. \"He's my friend.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I am.\" He smiled towards them. 'My apologies for the hurtful words I just said but the words, although hurtful were necessary to reassure someone. Are you reassured now that she will be safe with Rias?\" He snapped his fingers and the corner of the room glimmered slightly and there stood a guy with five tails and two fox ears swinging from side to side. He didn't look at anyone but Akame.</p><p><br></p><p>She felt her Queen still.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Akira.\" She heard her whisper slowly.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy lowered his head and looked at the ground. \"I am sorry for making you go through this Akan… . \"</p><p><br></p><p>His words were halted as Akame hugged him tight.</p><p><br></p><p>She looked at Damien who just smiled at her. \"Thank you.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I am the Devil of my word, Princess.\" She rolled her eyes at the ever cheeky reply. \"So, what's this I'm hearing about you giving up on lying. I appreciate it though but what brought this over?\" He smirked knowingly at her.</p><p><br></p><p>She turned her head to the other side in embarrassment. \"So, how did you get here? I mean not that I am not happy but this is still a surprise. You know Lady Paimon?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I needed to complete my deal, Princess. Also, Akira joined my team so I couldn't let him be sad.\" They both looked at the siblings who were talking to each other. Also a nice diversion there. You didn't answer my question.\" He smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>Tch, he caught onto that. The world would sooner see bunnies made from jelly beans take over it than her accepting that she said those words because she thought it sounded cool.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Well you didn't answer my question either. So let's call it even.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Let's do that then.\" He smiled and they talked about various topics.</p><p><br></p><p>\"So what does the name mean? I thought you didn't lie and yet see you are lying about your name.\"</p><p><br></p><p>He turned the nameplate on the table towards her. On it was written, Dr. Damien Louis Cypher.</p><p><br></p><p>Damien Louis Cypher?</p><p><br></p><p>Ah… . that's clever and a bit cool too.</p><p><br></p><p>\"I never claimed to be anyone other than me. If most people misunderstand things after, it's just a happy coincidence.\"</p><p><br></p><p>By then the two siblings were done with the talks and the brother looked towards Damien. \"Umm Boss. That thing you gave me. Can I give it to my sister? I promise you that I will train and not be a burden even without it.\" He asked with a lot of hesitation while looking at Damien.</p><p><br></p><p>She saw Damien narrow his eyes. “Are you sure? You want to give it up? That’s a chance that people would kill their entire families to have and you want to just give it up?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Boss.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Wait! I don’t need anything. I am safe and I have everything I can need in this place. Akira has to stay outside, he will need more power. Please don’t give anything to me.” Akame shouted.</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t think you should worry about that. As you are right now, there is a high chance that you will die if you eat that. You need great control of Senjutsu. Even more than normal for you because of your Evil Pieces. Moreover the changes that will bring will attract too much attention towards you and will make everyone too suspicious of you. We can’t have that. You have only heard about the changes it brings but haven’t seen the real thing yet. Believe me, it’s beyond anything you are imagining. ” I saw that Akira was listening to me. “So, I propose a solution. Everytime you come for therapy, you will meet Akira and he will teach you about Senjutsu and in a few years I will make one more of <em>that</em> for you. By then if Rias and you are strong enough, no one will have the guts to raise their voice. I will support you too.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I… thank you Boss. I will work for it. I won’t disappoint you at all.”</p><p><br></p><p>All of them talked for around an hour till it was time for them to leave. She was actually surprised that Beowulf didn’t even notice anyone like him inside the room.</p><p><br></p><p>Is he really that strong?</p><p><br></p><p>She quickly shook her head and looked at Akame who was looking far more relieved.</p><p><br></p><p>“Rias.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s fine. You are now a part of my family. We Gremorys always take care of the family.”</p><p><br></p><p>They didn’t speak anymore words to each other but somehow the silence itself was very comforting for them.</p><p><br></p><p>To help out her new peerage member, she had to become very strong in a few years. She had to do the same to keep her promise to Damien. She needed to increase her training more.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Sean -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Sean was thrown into the ground for the umpteenth time. The teacher he had here was merciless when training. Apparently she was training Sigurd too but the guy was treated completely different from him. Then again, he supposed he was a third wheel in the situation where they could be having their murdery and stabby dates. The regular Norse stuff.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ireland's child of Light. I was expecting more than this from the reincarnation of the ‘Son of Lugh’. I had the opportunity to fight that old man and he was very skilled with his spear. Don’t shame his name. Get up.” The white haired Valkyrie twirled her spear and looked down on him on the ground. Sean swore that he had some sort of bad luck with white haired women or they were just scary in general. Boss Lady was dangerous. Cleria could be very dangerous too. He just prayed that the Shorty and Shirone didn’t change when they became older. That would suck major balls.</p><p><br></p><p>“Give him a break, Brinhyldr. You are someone who can fight Gods with your spear and he, while good with spears, hasn’t had the time to bring out his full potential.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And he will not reach there at this rate either.” she sat down beside Sigurd while he pushed himself to his feet once more. “It’s time for your Runes lesson. I have called for the student that your Boss was interested in. I have seen her file and she’s related to Gondul, one of the senior most of the Valkyries and a premier Sorceress of Asgard. Although the reports say that she hasn’t inherited her family’s special affinity and thus cannot learn their special magic.”</p><p><br></p><p>This attracted Sean’s attention.</p><p><br></p><p>Boss called for a student?</p><p><br></p><p>The Boss never took anyone without exceptional talents or backgrounds.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is this girl also a reincarnation or a Sacred Gear user?”he asked curiously.</p><p><br></p><p>“She’s a pure blooded Valkyrie and no one’s reincarnation. Father has already checked. I might be thankful to your boss for saving Sigurd but even I wouldn’t promise the reincarnation of any hero to him. When I talked to her parents, they gladly agreed. Her grandmother was reluctant though and had to be reassured that she will be taken care of properly and be treated well.”</p><p><br></p><p>That’s strange.</p><p><br></p><p>Then again, The Boss just knows things sometimes.</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded his head. “The Boss treats everyone of us like his own family.”</p><p><br></p><p>“So my Sigurd says to me and thus I choose to put my trust in you.”</p><p><br></p><p>He followed her to the class to see a girl… another silver white haired girl. Seriously, what’s up with that? Does the boss have a fetish for this too? Or does he want his future children to look like him so much?</p><p><br></p><p>The girl herself looked to be around her Boss’ age, maybe a year or so younger. She was even looking very serious, her gaze never leaving his teacher. To be honest, she sort of looked like the Boss Lady only with blue eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Oh!</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, nothing going on between us, his ass.</p><p><br></p><p>The Bossman had the hots for the Boss Lady and just like everything else, he just hides it very well. On second thought, he might not even realise it himself.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes yes. His unreasonable powers, his insane strength and growth, his planning and ruthlessness aside, he was still a brat who just started growing his pubes. Of course, he won’t know about the things related to the heart. It seems that he would have to send this secret report to Merlin and guide the Boss to the correct path.</p><p><br></p><p>Who knows, it might also help the boss lady to chill down a bit.</p><p><br></p><p>“Introduce yourself child.” Teacher asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“My name is Rossweisse. I was told that I was called by Lady Brynhildr to be taken as a student.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, I did. I will be teaching you all that I can before you will be sent as an ambassador to a very important future ally of Asgard. Do you have any problems with it?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Umm…..”</p><p><br></p><p>“If there is a problem then state it freely, child.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What are the contract details? How much will be the payment and the amenities? Will there be holidays every year? How are the working conditions and what are the work details?”</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>….</p><p><br></p><p>Of all the things he had expected the girl to ask, this was the last one. Then again, such types of girls will be eaten alive back at home. He smiled thinking about the future he will get to see when he returns back home with the new teammate.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Interlude -</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>- ??? -</strong></p><p><br></p><p>\"You really enjoy annoying him, don't you?\" A female voice was heard in the white room.</p><p><br></p><p>\"His reactions are just too adorable.\" A male voice that was just talking to Damien was heard soon, replying to the first voice.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Still you could have easily fixed his soul despite the damage. Throwing him among <em>those</em> people was quite mean.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Dear, if I wanted to destroy a world, I would be much more suave about it… Just throw a Black Hole at it or something, not throw an idiot with too much power than he knows what to do with, at it. <em>That's</em> what I call being mean… to the whole world.\" The first voice replied nonchalantly.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Well… I can't disagree with that. The moment that guy was sent, his mental state was quite… unstable. But in hindsight, now it's obvious. You merged the soul of Lucifer with his own. It would be strange if he didn't have any destructive thoughts. Still… I have to commend him on getting over those and becoming who he is now. A normal human would have turned into something else, mostly a mass murdering supervillain or something on those lines. You were quite lucky there.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Oh, if only that were so. You see, I don't just choose people and throw them in to see if they work. Here, take a look at the guy's file, his previous reincarnations.\"</p><p><br></p><p>A file floated in the middle of the room.</p><p><br></p><p>Pages turned and all the previous reincarnations of Damien appeared on each page until the last one.</p><p><br></p><p>\"This! … but how?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Hahahaha now that's an interesting story in and of itself. I for one am waiting until he figures it out. I bet his face will be glorious.\"</p><p><br></p><p>The first voice sighed lightly. \"You have really weird ideas of fun sometimes.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Oh don't act like you don't like it.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Weird doesn't necessarily mean bad and I never said I disliked it. Still… to think it would be something like this…\"</p><p><br></p><p>The voices disappeared from the room and only the file remained, and on the last page of the file, the picture of Damien's adult face lay with a name beside it.</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p><br></p><p>… </p><p><br></p><p>… </p><p><br></p><p>… </p><p><br></p><p>Helel.</p><p><br></p><p>_____________________________________x___________________________________________________________________________x______________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: LuluViBritania(FF.N, SB and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Man, I was supposed to complete this chapter two days ago but I caught a fever.

    "content": "<p><strong>Disclaimer: I own nothing.</strong></p><p><strong>Chapter 16: Surprises.</strong></p><p><strong>- Damien –</strong></p><p>Two months have passed since the events of that night.</p><p>These two months have been eventful.</p><p>First of all, Kuroka went to Sun Wukong, as decided. He was surprised but took her in anyway. Nurarihyon had been on point.</p><p>Sun Wukong had been very enthusiastic about teaching her too. There were questions about me which she had confessed to but he didn’t mind. He did say that he would like to meet me once, which I had her agree to. I will meet him but only when I am ready.</p><p>Second thing that happened was that Merlin got the Innovate Clear from Helena after she completed her research and has successfully created a Time Dilation Space. The ratio of time in the outside world compared to the inside world is 1:4 but it is still a LOT.</p><p>The only thing is the power needed to maintain and run such a dimension. He can maintain such a dimension for around two days before he needs to rest for another two.</p><p>It could count as a form of training for him and he is actually enthusiastic about it. I sometimes wonder if the guy's a masochist or just plain crazy. </p><p>It seems like I need to make a power source for this, a battery of sorts. </p><p>The other part of our research was on the right track.</p><p>The Negative Fruits as we had come to call them over time. These cheeky little buggers were a lot more interesting than the simple Chakra Fruit. We had to separate its power into several smaller pieces and then test it on the subjects we had gathered.</p><p>The first batch of subjects were Ayakashi, the most obvious ones.</p><p>The result was a mixed bunch.</p><p>Some went mad while some were empowered, the key was the amount of power in the fruit.</p><p>Thankfully all of these subjects were the ones who were either caught by the Old Satan faction or by Hihi, the previous leader of Kuroka's territory and were mostly insane or criminals.</p><p>They were thrown back to the not so Chakra Tree again. </p><p>The second was the use of very tiny portions of these fruits to create intense emotions in Sacred Gear users and let them awaken their Balance Breakers. It was a project Helena was working on. This project was a massive success. It took us some time to get the ratio correct and I had to use my 'Denial of the Divine' to calm them down and extract the negative fruit's power from them to stop them from going on a rampage but among the nineteen test subjects, everyone of them had awakened their Balance Breakers.</p><p>I took this opportunity to teach Vienna the basics of 'Denial of the Divine' too. She however was very reluctant to learn it because it was not flashy enough for her. </p><p>In hindsight she has been getting too overconfident. Kuroka being here actually helped a lot because she could fight her on an equal ground and keep her cockiness in check. Now with her gone, I feel like I need to create a suitable opponent for her.</p><p>Maybe Akeno could become her rival… In fact I would have done that if it hadn't been for the current situation.</p><p>I watched as the girl was covered with the red colored flames of the Vermillion Bird. This headache came to me around a month ago.</p><p>I wanted Akeno to remain a half fallen to master her power properly before making her a half devil or something.</p><p>It had come suddenly and I had to inform Nurarihyon to arrange for a meeting with the Himejima clan to propose a trade. The youkai in question however suggested that I wait.</p><p>The Himejima Clan was in an uproar right now but they were keeping it a secret so as to not let the other factions know of it. Their leaders were killed in a 'rebellion'. Who would have thought that the Ketchup-head had it in him? Then again I shouldn't be so surprised as he did fight in the Civil War. </p><p>Thus the one month wait. In the meantime, I had Celine, who had recovered considerably, study it to enhance her own Holy Flames.</p><p>Akeno had been going to Ophelia regularly for her therapy and was recovering well. Celine had actually helped her understand that grouping all the people of a Race was stupid because there were all kinds of people in a race.</p><p>Moreover as two girls more or less abandoned by their fathers, they developed a kind of a bond. She however followed Vienna like a lost puppy at times and the said girl relished in having a close friend her age. </p><p>The Himejima had been stewing in their own sweat by the end of the month. The new Head, Suzaku Himejima, the person who was the lead in inheriting the Vermillion Bird had somehow taken control of the clan which was breaking apart due to several people not accepting her due to her not inheriting the Vermillion Bird.</p><p>Some wanted her to step down for 'losing the Vermillion Bird' while others were just pushing their own agendas.</p><p>A fifteen years old could barely keep the clan afloat and that too was due to another elder who was supporting her not for pure reasons obviously but to marry her to his twenty six year old grandson and establish himself as the leader behind the scenes.</p><p>It was time to offer her a Deal. I mean it's only in desperate times that even people like these would make a 'Deal with the Devil'. </p><p>I called for Gretel and Akeno(or is it currently Suzaku?) to accompany me to the Himejima Clan.</p><p><strong>- Scene Change -</strong></p><p>The grey mist subsided from around us as Akeno, Gretel and I stepped into the Himejima Clan's inner compound. I had covered us under my illusion as we walked towards the house at the center of the compound. Unlike normal when the compound was surrounded by several guards, it was vacant with barely any people around. </p><p>I sensed three auras inside the place. Two in the same room while one in a different room. The aura that was alone was strong. An Ultimate Class although only the lower reaches, it was still a bit surprising that this place had someone like this even now.</p><p>The room near the garden was Suzaku's room. </p><p>As I got closer, I recognized the one who Suzaku had in the room with her and a small smile lit my face.</p><p>The world really is a small place.</p><p>I sensed that Akeno stiffened when she realized the place we were in but I patted her head and reassured her. Gretel grabbed a hold of her hand to show her support too and we stepped forward towards Suzaku's room. </p><p>I knocked on the door. </p><p>\"Yes.\" came a cold voice from the other side. </p><p>I just knocked again. </p><p>This time one of the people got up and came to the door, sliding it open. \"What do you need at this time of the night…\" Her words got stuck in her mouth as she recognized me.</p><p>\"Well hello there. It's been a while and I would say I am here to meet you but that would be lying and i don't lie. That said, nice to meet you again, Momiji Nakiri. Are you enjoying your freedom?\" I smiled at the former host of my Telos Karma, greeting her. </p><p>\"Why are you here? \" She asked cautiously. </p><p>\"Hey there. I don't think our meeting was bad enough to warrant such caution. As for your answer, I am here to offer a deal, just like I did with you but to the other girl here. What can I say, I am a sucker for pretty faces.\" I joked and it did have the intended effect as she blushed slightly. </p><p>\"I liked the serious you better.\"</p><p>\"Really? I thought this cheerful personality was more popular. I guess girls are more into the mysterious types.\"</p><p>By then the other occupant of the room had arrived at the door as well and saw us, her eyes stuck to Akeno but she maintained her caution towards me. There was a slight blush on her face too. My charm is increasing every day from the Asmodeus trait as well as the Essence of the King.</p><p>Long black hair, red eyes and a budding figure. She looks like an older, curvier version of Akeno with red coloured eyes.</p><p>“Hello Suzaku Himejima….” I greeted her before stopping. “It’s still Suzaku, right?”</p><p>Her eyes twitched slightly but she didn’t comment so I continued. “As you have already heard, I am here for a Deal. I mean no harm to you or your company.”</p><p>“What kind of deal?” she asked curtly. I have to say that for a fifteen year old, she really bags that ice cold beauty troupe to the T. Even rivaling my cute Maid in this aspect.</p><p>“Suzaku-chan….call him inside. Others might notice the strangers. As much as I would like to speak against this person, it is a fact that he keeps his word. He will not harm us.”</p><p>She looked at us for a moment but called us inside.</p><p>We took our seats with Akeno sitting beside me while Gretel sat behind me. By now, she had become adept in Japanese customs and was sitting in a proper way.</p><p>“Well now that we are all seated properly, I will go ahead and propose my deal. The deal is simple, I or rather Akeno will trade back the Suzaku, before you interrupt me, yes, Akeno is the new Host, yes, she was blessed by the Shinto deities qualified for the station as was her mother, the main reason why she was killed by your Clan members.”</p><p>Akeno clenched her fingers and teeth while Suzaku withered, looking down to avoid Akeno’s gaze.</p><p>Momiji surprisingly looked stunned but soon enough a look of realization came over her face.</p><p>“The deal is simple, Akeno will give you the Vermilion Bird back, you can keep it, roast it, eat it whatever you want, but in return you will return the body of Shuri Himejima as well as the copy all the Magical and Martial Knowledge that the Himejima Clan possesses. They should have been Akeno’s by right for being the True host of the Vermilion Bird. She is giving up the Bird but no one can and will deny her the other Perks.”</p><p>“Shuri-san was a member of our Clan.” Suzaku started only to be interrupted….</p><p>“YOU PEOPLE KILLED MOTHER!” the little girl broke down. Thankfully I had put a barrier around the place.</p><p>Gretel went ahead and put a hand on her shoulder.</p><p>“As already stated by Akeno, she might have the blood of this clan this is also the clan of her murderers. There is no way we will allow her body to stay here.”</p><p>Razevan had taken Aria’s body along with the bodies of his two previous wives out a long time ago and we had no idea about where Gretel’s mother’s body was kept. I guess we'll just have to rip it out of Euclid’s bloodied body.</p><p>She bit her lips but stayed quiet so I decided to push a little.</p><p>“Please think carefully, Suzaku-san.”</p><p>She looked at Akeno this time. “You can take the position of the Clan Head. The Vermilion Bird has chosen you. You are the new Head. That’s the rule our Clan follows.”</p><p>….</p><p>This girl was truly naive.</p><p>Naive people are good to make deals with.</p><p>Akeno obviously rejected it flat-out.</p><p>“You really think that your racist clan would accept someone with Akeno’s heritage as a Clan Head? Your previous Clan Head exiled his own sister for practising Buddhist Arts and his brother for not being blessed by the Shinto Gods, and since then many other members have faced the same situation, your Clan Members more or less chased her around for a year while they made a deal to sell her to the peerage of a Devil and that was after killing her mother, even at the risk of starting a war… Do you really think such people will just bend over backwards and accept her as a leader? Oh my, I pity the future of the Himejima Clan with a leader like you.”</p><p>Her mouth opened and closed without any words to reply.</p><p>“Please tell me you answer Suzaku-san.” I implored.</p><p>“I cannot make the decision about the Knowledge of the Himejima Clan.”</p><p>“You are the Clan Head and after you get the Vermilion Bird, no one can question you. On the other hand, without the Vermilion Bird, your clan becomes a mid ranked Clan of common priests and let’s not forget the enemies you have made in all this time. For how long do you think you can hide the disappearance of the Vermilion Bird? I mean isn’t that why you called Miss Momiji here and her brother, ah right guess from your expressions, to talk to.”</p><p>I didn’t say anything further.</p><p>She looked at Momiji who didn’t answer.</p><p>A few minutes passed away in silence and then she nodded.</p><p>“Very well, now we are talking.”</p><p>“Can you really transfer the Vermilion Bird?”</p><p>“Miss Momiji here can attest to that. I am kinda adept in such stuff.”</p><p>A look of realization flashed through her eyes as she eyed the other girl who nodded. In the meantime, I passed her the contract to read.</p><p>She took up the contract to read and soon pointed out the same thing as Momiji had back then. “If any of my Clan Members, including me, attack Akeno or you, directly or indirectly, with the intention of causing harm, I will become Akeno’s servant.”</p><p>“It’s the same thing I offered Miss Momiji. I can’t have you or anyone from your Clan coming after or hiring anyone to come after Akeno to kill her to retrieve the knowledge or come after me to annoy me.”</p><p>“You really think that the Five Principal Clans cannot kill you?” Momiji asked me curiously this time.</p><p>“I don’t think so… I know it for sure. You people are too narrow-minded and hamper your own potential with your bias. I mean your clans are biased against anything not their own. To be honest, at this point, your clans could rename themselves the Hyuga and no one would blink an eye. These kinds of people will never defeat me. I <em>refuse</em> to let that happen.”</p><p>“So power is everything to you?” she countered.</p><p>“I didn’t hear these words from you when I offered you a deal back then.”</p><p>That shut her up.</p><p>Suzaku, on the other hand, had made up her mind by then. She walked up to a desk in the room and brought a pen and I sent a smirk towards Momiji who looked red in embarrassment.</p><p>She returned and signed the contract. I guess she was under a lot of pressure.</p><p>“Akeno, sign the contract.” The girl followed my instructions without any questions and signed it.</p><p>A bright flash of light later, Suzaku Himejima became the new host of the Vermilion Bird.</p><p>She looked wide-eyed at herself as a wisp of purifying flame lit up in her hand.</p><p>“Now time to keep your side of the deal.”</p><p>“I will need a few days to prepare everything. You have my word that I will fulfill my side of the contract.” she bowed or rather did a dogeza to Akeno.</p><p>“A week. I will return in a week to collect everything.”</p><p>She then looked at Akeno and touched her head to the floor, “I know what the people of this clan have done to you is unforgivable but I will work hard to make sure that one day you can forgive us.”</p><p>Akeno, for her part, didn’t snap this time but simply turned away and left the room.</p><p>“In that case, have a good day, Miss Suzaku, Miss Momiji.</p><p><strong>- Scene Change -</strong></p><p>We retrieved Shuri’s coffin and moved it to a place in Kuroka’s territory and received all the Knowledge from her personally a week later.</p><p>From the news that I had received, some people had actually questioned Suzaku’s leadership if she had <em>lost</em> the Vermilion Bird once, what’s keeping her from losing it once more. Surprisingly it was the same elder that was supporting her. He put forward the reasons that Suzaku needed to be given proper guidance and tried to force her into a marriage with his son. Too bad, this Suzaku had experienced quite a lot of stress and was not in the mood to accept the bullshit of anyone. She directly summoned the purifying flames and burned both that elder and his son to ashes, completely shutting up everyone who had any questions about her.</p><p>With the Clan having lost most of the stronger fighters in the squabble against us, no one dared to question her anymore.</p><p>They could only vent their frustration on something else and I being a good friendly devil, decided to give them a proper target, namely… myself.</p><p>It wasn’t even hard work. I just had to make a Shadow Clone and put myself under illusion to inform them of a devil in the compound.</p><p>One of the idiots attacked me when I had completed the deal with Suzaku.</p><p>Things happened so fast that she had no chance to react at all.</p><p>In just two visits, I had all the knowledge and the Head of the Himejima Clan in my hands. She obviously burned the guy to ashes before she could ask him anything so there was no chance to ask anything anymore.</p><p>I did give the girl some hope by not interfering with her Clan and even offering my support as it was an <em>accident</em>.</p><p>Akeno didn’t want anything to do with it so she just left once more leaving Suzaku actually even more grateful.</p><p>We all decided to keep this a secret from her Clan.</p><p>What can I say, she made a Deal with the Devil. She should have thought things through.</p><p>I returned and started to work on the massive reserve of knowledge they had accumulated over their long history.</p><p>They might have been fucking biased towards other arts but that didn’t prevent them from gathering everything they could get their hands on.</p><p>Merlin was having a blast.</p><p>Other than Akeno, he was the one who benefited from it the most. I for one wanted to see if they had something that would help with the situation of my soul.</p><p>There was however another person who was very grateful when Akeno agreed to share these with her, Tsubaki Shinra.</p><p>She couldn’t learn the heritage spells and techniques of the Shinra Clan but that didn’t mean she couldn’t learn anything from the Himejima Clan either.</p><p>To be honest, in terms of Spiritual Arts, Tsubaki was even more talented than Akeno. In fact she was leaning more towards the martial aspect of training. The Shinra Clan taking on the traits of their patron deity, are more focused on close quarters fighting, a martial clan as compared to the spell casters of the Himejima. That didn’t mean their clans don’t know of the other arts, it was just a preference.</p><p>In fact there were several spells that belonged to the Shinra Clan as well. Some of the previous Clan Heads must have collected those when they had a chance. I appreciate their hard work.</p><p>Unfortunately, there were mainly spells to harm souls, very few about healing but they were of the holy aspect and would injure me even more.</p><p>I am currently working on a technique to help me solve these problems. A technique from my previous life, the Cursed Technique Reversal of the Juijutsu Sorcerers. Theoretically the curses were quite similar to the Ayakashi, born out of human malice. Technically anyone who can use Negative Emotions like these can use Curse Techniques.</p><p>Although I looked the part for it, I didn’t have a way to go complete Gojo due to not having a way to control my power so precisely for the time being but there were other things I could work out.</p><p>I mean it could be a completely new branch of techniques that the Ayakashi could use and I could just buff them up with the negative fruits.</p><p>The Cursed Technique Reversal was a healing technique which was extremely useful as well as the basis of a technique that could turn negative energy into positive energy. I did observe that Cleria’s Ten Tails could be modified to just collect Malice in the world and make negative fruits indefinitely. Nature Energy and lifeforce cannot be harnessed so easily. Even in these three months since the first fruit was harvested, we have only managed to make two more of those and had barely spotted any other dimension suitable to plant the Ten Tails.</p><p>There was something like this in the future which was invented by the Fallen Angels as well. Another thing to look into. </p><p>Merlin was working on his fake dimension and all the life inside it but that was basically him pouring in his power to create everything. It would take him around a year to make a dimension suitable enough to produce a fruit with the Ten Tails and that was unacceptable since he was using it for the Time Dilation chambers for our training.</p><p>In such a case, if a way is found to change the Negative energy into positive energy, we could technically have an infinite supply of energy and make as many fruits as we want.</p><p>It’s one thing after another. I just couldn’t catch a break.</p><p>The only thing that kept me going was the thought of an army of Ayakashi with Curse Techniques and Domain Expansions supporting me.</p><p>The Cursed Technique Reversal could technically be used to change positive techniques to negative techniques too. So maybe I could reverse the Holy Flames into demonic flames or my own Demonic Flames into Holy Flames?</p><p>So while my main body trained, the Shadow Clones worked hard to create curse techniques from scratch.</p><p>To be honest, mastering chakra was worth it just to use the Shadow Clones. They are probably the best Technique from the Naruto world.</p><p><strong>- Rias -</strong></p><p>Rias closed the door behind her and let out a sigh.</p><p>Akame hadn’t eaten a single bite of food even today.</p><p>She was starting to worry about the girl. It had been three days since Onii-sama brought her here after he saved her from being executed.</p><p>She had rarely seen him so angry or tired for that matter.</p><p>After hearing everything, she found out the reason for his anger.</p><p>Akame’s brother had killed his King and peerage when he had lost control over his powers and fled. The other devils had declared that Akame was also a danger and thus was to be executed.</p><p>That was plain stupid.</p><p>What did that even have to do with Akame?</p><p>Although she did hear her Onii-sama speak about someone when she was listening in about him complaining about the relations with the Youkai and how ‘He’ seemed to be quite close to the Youkai faction which would cause further problems.</p><p>Akame, who was let go only because her Onii-sama had vouched for her and had Akame join her peerage to keep anyone from attacking her, had completely closed herself off from the whole world. She didn’t talk to anyone or eat anything. Even her eyes looked… dead.</p><p>Rias had tried many things. She tried to tell her about Mangas and show them to her. It was a bad idea. Naruto, while one of her favourites, had a Kyuubi rampaging in the first chapter and that was probably not a good memory for a young four tailed Kitsune. She had removed all her Naruto collection the very next day. It was only Bleach and One Piece on her bookshelves now.</p><p>She had tried showing her anime and bringing different types of food for her to try, even talking to her till late into the nights to get her to open up… nothing worked.</p><p>Mother told her to keep on trying and she will respond.</p><p>Maybe she should ask someone else for advice… maybe her new friend?</p><p>She returned to her room and closed the door after checking that no one was looking and went to her bed, under her blanket, closing her eyes, with both her hands clasped on her heart, she called out to <em>him</em> in her mind. <em>“Damien, I need your help. Can you hear me?”</em></p><p>It happened a while ago. Two days after her talk with her Mother and when she started her training, she was wondering if her Mother’s words were true and if she really didn’t have a chance? It was disheartening and even if she wouldn’t give up without trying, she still felt a bit sad at the thought….and that’s when she heard his voice.</p><p>It had been her… no, it had been <em>their</em> secret since then.</p><p><em>“Hello Princess. What can I do for you today?”</em></p><p><em>“Hello Damien. I… I need your help with something.”</em></p><p><em>“Oh, a Deal? How interesting.”</em></p><p>She pouted a little. What was with all the Devils and their fetish with deals?</p><p><em>“I don’t know what to offer you for a deal though.”</em></p><p><em>“Oh, that’s easy. I take anything I have an interest in, a favour, a useful piece of information… your first kiss. I mean we did the soul and all but that’s outdated nowadays. I don’t like virgin sacrifices either. So that’s the only one left, right?”</em> he said the last part casually and Rias felt her cheeks heat up at the very image.</p><p><em>“A… My… a favour. I will owe you a favour.”</em> She kept herself from getting lost in her fantasies.</p><p><em>“l) Ah, so sad. I seemed to have missed the first kiss.”</em> She felt her heart skip a beat but it was much better than the first time they had talked. Apparently his sister had been correct about one thing, Damien Lucifer was an incorrigible flirt. And then she heard his muffled chuckle and realised that he had been teasing her again.</p><p><em>“Are you making fun of me again?”</em></p><p><em>“Yes.”</em></p><p><em>“Don’t say that so nonchalantly!”</em> she gritted her teeth. <em>“Just you wait, one day, I will make you eat your words.”</em></p><p><em>“Whatever you say Princess. So what were you saying?”</em></p><p><em>“A… anyways,”</em> she cursed her stutter. <em>“I need a favour from you too.”</em></p><p><em>“Sure, go on, I’m listening.”</em></p><p><em>“Recently I have gained my first peerage member, a Queen piece. Her name is Akame and she is a four tailed Kitsune.”</em></p><p><em>“My congratulations on gaining your first peerage member, Princess. That’s your first step towards becoming the future Champion of the Rating Games. Kitsunes are very loyal once they accept you but it is extremely hard to gain their allegiance though. A Nine Tailed Kitsune could even rival a Satan with proper training and resources. The Fox Fire of Yasaka, the leader of the Kyoto Youkai can almost rival those of a Dragon King. Add to that the extra potential from her newly acquired Devil side and you have yourself a very great first piece. Just make sure that she doesn’t neglect any of her sides or herself. That would hamper her potential greatly.”</em></p><p>She listened to those points and marked them for later. First she needed to solve the problems of her Queen. <em>“T-thank you. A-anyways, my queen has a problem. Her brother, Akira, apparently went mad with power and had killed his King and Peerage members so many devils wanted to execute her too which was extremely stupid. She has been very depressed and I messed up too because when I was trying to cheer her up, I accidentally showed her the Naruto Manga and she became even more depressed and wouldn't even talk to anyone. I need your help to cheer her up once more. I have heard that you are familiar with the Youkai….so can you help me find her brother? I want to help my Queen out of her depression and become cheerful again.”</em></p><p><em>“Mmh, that’s quite a story, Princess. Sure. I will help you out. I did make a deal after all. As for you messing up when cheering her up, we still don’t know the Nine Tailed Fox’s side of the story so we don’t know if it was bad. We shouldn’t just believe in everything people say. I mean, Mizuki was pretending to be nice too. You did a good thing. Your intentions were good and that’s what matters the most. You should keep on trying to help her and I will help you find her brother. As I have already said, you are a very kind girl, Princess and that’s what I love about you the most.”</em></p><p>Rias felt her blush brighten with each word. <em>“I-I will hold you to that.”</em></p><p><em>“Obviously Princess. My words are my bond.”</em> He whispered again.</p><p>Good. At least she had someone helping her out with this other than what Onii-sama was doing.</p><p><em>“What do you want for the favour?”</em> she asked.</p><p><em>“It’s something very important.”</em></p><p><em>“Tell me.”</em></p><p><em>“I want you to take your new Queen to a psychiatrist. The experiences like the ones she has been through leave a mark on the minds of people. It would help both you and your Queen if you did that. You can ask your family to arrange for that.”</em></p><p><em>“Really?”</em></p><p><em>“Absolutely. I had Akeno go through the same. You are looking for a good lifelong friend and confidant not a lackey. You should take care of both their physical and mental health.”</em></p><p><em>“I didn’t know that.”</em></p><p><em>“Well now you know.”</em></p><p><em>“Okay, I will do that anyway. Tell me what favour you want?”</em></p><p><em>“I already did that Princess.”</em></p><p><em>“But that doesn’t count. That’s something for my Queen. I would do that anyway. You are not getting anything out of this.”</em></p><p><em>“But I am, Princess. I am getting you to help out the first Peerage member of my friend. That does sound like something I get out of this.”</em></p><p><em>“T-that doesn’t even make sense.”</em></p><p><em>“Oh, so you are not my friend?”</em></p><p><em>“Wha… I didn’t mean that.”</em></p><p><em>“Then I am getting everything I want. If you really want to do something extra for me, train hard, become stronger and I will be much happier. Oh, but do remember to rest as well. I would hate it if you got sick because of me”</em></p><p><em>“Really?”</em></p><p><em>“Absolutely.”</em></p><p><em>“Then I promise you.”</em></p><p><em>“I will hold you onto that too, Princess.So tell me how you have been doing.”</em> he continued and Rias also relaxed in her bed and started telling him about her days, her training with her Mother, her trying to get her Queen to open up, Millicas being an adorable kid, the new volume of Naruto manga and Natuto in the Chunin Exam fight against that stuck-up meanie, Neji and the attack on the stadium.</p><p>She always had fun discussing Manga with him.</p><p>And just like that, in time she felt sleepy and dozed off.</p><p><strong>- Damien -</strong></p><p>She’s adorable. Especially the crush that she has on me. Devil children can be really promiscuous as is evident by the actions of many young devils but her actions are more adorable than anything.</p><p>The girl needed a friend after being stuck with her family and servants for so long, that when I offered her a chance, she latched onto me. We talk about our lives and manga, her hobbies that she had no one to talk to about, and it does remind me of my discussions with my friends in my previous life. A very refreshing change of pace compared to what I normally do.</p><p>I am really starting to enjoy teasing her like this and getting her flustered. Apparently the Gremorys are having an aneurysm about her crushing on me. As for if something develops between us, that will have to wait until she’s old enough to reasonably think for herself.</p><p>She did provide me with some useful information so I guess I will do her this deal as a favour.</p><p>Who would have thought that Sirzechs was actually wary of my relationship with the Youkai and solved the matter before they could actually pass on the decision to execute her or even bring it to the council.</p><p>Well, it did solve the trouble of having to rescue her myself.</p><p>I got up from my seat and walked towards our newest recruit. Blonde, almost white hair, golden pupils and two fox ears on his head. How are you holding up? I hope the people here are treating you well, Akira?”</p><p>“M-Master… I have been good”</p><p>“Don’t force yourself to use that word, I know you have many bad memories attached to it. You can just call me by my name.” I patted his shoulder.</p><p>“I-I couldn’t.” he stuttered in reply and I smiled.</p><p>“Then call me Boss. Sean does that too. This place is not like your previous King’s. We protect our people like family.”</p><p>“Yes. I owe my life to you all. If it hadn’t been for you, I…” he let his words die out and lowered his head to look at the ground.</p><p>“Don’t think about that past. I have some news about your sister.” His head snapped up. “She was in trouble but as I had assured you, she was saved in time. She is currently the Queen of Sirzechs’ little sister, Rias Gremory… who happens to be a secret friend of mine.” I saw his eyes widen and so did my smile. “What, surprised? Anyways, your sister is… depressed and has cut herself off from everyone so my cute friend has requested me to find a way to find you to help her… and guess what? I just found you. Now tell me a way to cheer your sister up.” I questioned.</p><p>“I… I want to bring her back.”</p><p>“That’s near impossible for now. I assure you that she is very safe where she is now. I will arrange for you two to meet soon enough but for now, think of something, a message to send to your sister. I suggest telling her everything.”</p><p>He clenched his hands, gritting his teeth. “I ran away. I left her alone there.”</p><p>“You ran away to separate her from your so-called crimes so that she will not become a target for anyone. You were injured and would have died had I not found you at the right time. Your choice was the right one. It’s just that you underestimated the pettiness of the devils.”</p><p>“I… you are a devil too you know?” he countered, finding no words.</p><p>“And that’s where you are mistaken. I am ‘The Devil’.” I smirked as he rolled his eyes. Akira was a feisty guy and didn’t hesitate to state his opinions which was quite refreshing.</p><p>“Did Merlin go over your health? Did the removal of the Evil Piece leave any sequelae on you?”</p><p>“No. I feel just fine. Mr. Merlin said that he didn’t observe anything wrong with me either. The experiments had harmed me but it will recover in a month at best. The medicines that Lady Helena provided me with, were very good for healing all my injuries.”</p><p>“Good to know. Recover well. I need the message in two days. You can think of it in your free time. Your sister will be safe and well where she is now.”</p><p>“Thank you Boss… for… for everything.”</p><p>“You are now a part of my family Akira. I take care of my people.”</p><p>He hesitated a bit and then spoke up either way, “I… had heard a lot of things about the Lucifer House… so when I found out you were a Lucifer I was not expecting… this.”</p><p>“You heard a lot about the Naberius too and look how that ended. Don’t believe in everything you hear, Akira. As for the crazy Lucifer thing, it did have a certain truth to it. There are bad apples in every family. I won’t say anything more than that.”</p><p>He nodded and I took this chance to leave.</p><p><strong>- Kuroka -</strong></p><p>Kuroka picked up the fish snacks from the shop and walked through the streets of the market. This place was in the countryside where the old monkey had brought her to train. Sure the training had been pretty good and her skills had progressed by leaps and bounds in a single month. She had gained another tail and was now able to control the Nature Energy inside her own body as well as blending herself in with Nature.</p><p>Shadow Clones were such cheats. That’s why her master was the best.</p><p>And unlike the old monkey, she didn’t need to rip out her hair as well.</p><p>The old monkey had tried to imitate her skill but was completely unable to do so because this type of Chakra could only be taught due to her Master’s power and not easily imitated by anyone. He had been put off for an entire month after that and had also increased Kuroka’s training several fold because she could take it. What the hell was that supposed to mean? You shouldn’t beat people just because they can take it? That’s just plain stupid. Then again she had her doubts about the old timer’s sanity anyways. Yu Long, the Dragon King often lazed around the place and he told her the same thing. Her new teacher, Sun Wukong walks a fine line between a genius and completely batshit crazy, often swinging on either side of it.</p><p>Still… she missed everything back home. She missed Shirone, she missed her Master, she even missed the little gremlin Vienna and their spars… <em>sigh</em> but this was also necessary. A Sage would be greatly beneficial for their Organisation and the entirety of Youkai kind.</p><p>She heard about the recent debacle of the kitsune and the devils and the new member who had joined them. She needed to learn everything she could from the old monkey so that she could teach them to everyone else. Shirone and now Akira.</p><p>While walking back to the mountain where she lived, she sensed a massive aura with her senjutsu. The old monkey told her to make it a habit to sense her surroundings at all times. It will help her integrate herself with Nature more. It was covered, not hidden but rather… unawakened. She knew this sort of feeling. This was a Sacred Gear, a massively powerful Sacred Gear on par with Vienna’s, Cleria’s or Gretel’s… a Longinus.</p><p>She looked for the source and found herself looking at a black haired boy with tattered clothes, looking at the food stalls with hunger in his eyes. </p><p>Master always paid the people for their Sacred Gears. Maybe she can take him as a lackey for it. </p><p>He will get food and care and she will get the Longinus and a surprise for her Master and maybe another date. She already had one date reserved because she had to come to this place before they could go on that one. </p><p>Her smile widened as she went forward.</p><p><strong>- Damien -</strong></p><p>I looked at the scroll in front of me that was sent by Kuroka. She had encountered a Sacred Gear user while in her training and she said that this was a surprise and that she wanted another date for this one. Other than that she said nothing. I was with Merlin, Sean and Gretel to check the Sacred Gear she sent us.</p><p>Well it won't do us any good to just keep on guessing.</p><p>Sean went ahead and signed the contract. It was one of my contracts that all my direct subordinates carry to transfer Sacred Gears. </p><p>The reason why Sean was the one to sign it was because he was human and some Sacred Gears can be harmful to Devils or other races and Kuroka didn't know which one this was either, so we were taking some precautions for this.</p><p>“So how do I do this? Imagine the strongest thing I can and will for it to awaken, right?” he asked and Merlin nodded.</p><p>“Well here goes nothing.” He closed his eyes facing towards the empty training ground and took a stance in the form of his usual spearmanship and thrust forward with a shout, “Gae Bolg.”</p><p>It happened in an instant. I caught the attack in my future sight and flashed away with Gretel and Merlin while putting a barrier in front of us.</p><p>Sean on the other hand was thrown backward while a golden flash of light left a crevice in front of us, dividing the entire training ground into two.</p><p>….</p><p>A moment of silence prevailed as we all looked at the golden spear in Sean’s hand and the mile long crevice interchangeably.</p><p>“Well that was….what’s the word for it.” Merlin looked lost, trying to figure out the words himself.</p><p>“Fuck.” Sean cried out.</p><p>“Fuck indeed.” Merlin replied without noticing.</p><p>I might or might not have nodded myself.</p><p>Gretel who would have normally punted Merlin into the ground for such language, didn’t act because she was also just as much at a loss of words as us.</p><p>I bet everyone was thinking of the same thing right now… how in the nine hells did Kuroka snag the True Longinus of all things?</p><p>Sean turned and showed us the spear and I could see the astonished look on his face but something else soon caught my attention.</p><p>The Spear itself. It was as if it called out to me. There were no voices or any mental commands and yet I was drawn towards it. That was odd in itself because Gretel seemed to detest being in the Spear’s presence and was clenching her hand nearby. I walked forward very slowly.</p><p>It wasn’t a mental attack or if it was then my mental defences didn’t work at all. </p><p>“Boss.” Sean asked but I didn’t know what he was saying, I just didn’t pay any attention to him.</p><p>I raised my hand and touched the spear.</p><p>And darkness took over me.</p><p>The last thing I heard was Gretel’s worried shout, calling out my name.</p><p><strong>- Interlude -</strong></p><p><strong>- Sun Wukong -</strong></p><p>Sun Wukong watched as his apprentice and her….lackey(her own words, not his) sat down meditating to sense their surroundings.</p><p>It was quite a surprise when she came home that day with a new lackey and that too, the inheritor of Cao Cao.</p><p>He almost did a spit-take on Yu Long’s face.</p><p>That said, the boy was quite easy to get along with. The main thing was that he treated Kuroka as a Goddess on earth.</p><p>Sun Wukong chuckled thinking about what he knew about his new apprentice, it might not even be much different from the truth.</p><p>He had noticed the difference between himself and Kuroka, the moment they met.</p><p>Kuroka was somehow made attuned to Nature Energy. While he didn’t know how and the girl didn’t say a word about it, this was done by the new Lucifer that he heard about.</p><p>Magari had opened up to him about the Lucifer child.</p><p>The only things that even she knew about him was that he or his people found both Shirone and Kuroka and brought them to Magari after their mother’s death. Before that they stayed with some devils and were taken care of. Their Master seems to have no problems with people of other races unlike his predecessors and had even helped Nurarihyon and proposed to ally with him as well as saved a half Fallen Angel girl which was unthinkable to most of the Devil kind let alone the kin of their creator. It did show that he was unlike his family, not that Sun Wukong ever cared about that in the first place. This did give him hope.</p><p>The Devils have been running rampant and the recent news about the Kitsune child killing his king was spreading around like wildfire. They even had the audacity to claim that a Kitsune had gone mad from Nature Energy. The sheer foolishness of that statement was more funny than enraging.</p><p>It was clear that something else was afloat with how much they tried to spread their version of the story or even how they had tried to execute the twin sister of the child, who was still a full blooded Kitsune for being a danger.</p><p>Yasaka had been incensed about her kin being smuggled to the Underworld in the first place and now this incident was just just testing her patience even more.</p><p>Although the girl was saved due to the intervention of the Crimson Satan, the Youkai faction of West Japan had banned the devils from being allowed in their territory as well as ceased all their connections with them which led to several of the properties of the Devils in the area to be relocated or be sold out. Sirzechs had been very active in trying to solve this matter and it to some extent quelled the anger of the irate vixen allowing him to retain one hotel of the Gremory House in Kyoto because of his protecting the child but Sun Wukong knew why exactly the Crimson Satan was forced to move.</p><p>He was afraid.</p><p>He was afraid to provoke the new player who had suddenly appeared and could upset the entire balance of things at will….and seemed to be particularly chummy with the Youkai.</p><p>He sighed. In a way owed the boy whom he hadn’t even met before for keeping matters from getting worse….and giving the Youkai all over the world, a new sage….or whatever Kuroka was.</p><p>As someone born from Nature itself, he realized that Kuroka’s connection with Nature was not like his own. While he was favoured by Nature as its child, Kuroka….she was fawned over by the Nature Energy as if their Queen, or a God.</p><p>This meant that she could possibly achieve more than him in time if she continued training….and the Devil could reproduce such an effect.</p><p>A part of Sun Wukong hoped that whatever happened to Kuroka was just an accident because the very thought of someone being able to replicate such a feat chilled his very spine. While the other part was hoping that he did this to a few more young children so that the Youkai all over the world may have a strong backing to avoid being exploited by anyone.</p><p>He was at least sure that if he could repeat this feat, then Shirone would probably be the same as Kuroka very soon and if Nurarihyon could get a bite in, then maybe one of his subordinates too.</p><p>Either way he had to train the new generation of Sages.</p><p>Now if only his own stupid grandson was half this talented or even a quarter this enthusiastic in training.</p><p>Well, you can’t have everything.</p><p>_____________________________x___________________________________________________________x______________________________</p><p><strong>Beta Reader: LuluViBritania(FF.N, SB and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><strong>I tried to show Damien’s devil side in this chapter with the Himejimas. It was an opportunity to get his grip over a decent force and Damien took it.</strong></p><p><strong>The matter with Rias. No, he is not forcing the Binders Essence to make her love him. Their relationship is just as I have written. Damien sees her as a valuable asset who is slowly becoming a friend while Rias is enjoying her ‘secret’ with her new friend/crush.</strong></p><p><strong>They are genuinely bonding over their shared hobbies. One has to remember that Damien before his rebirth was a massive otaku. Back at his base, almost everyone considers him a boss or is not quite an anime fan. So this is a refreshing change for Damien to be….himself.</strong></p><p><strong>The thing with the Youkai Twins has happened. The Naberius devil had been experimenting with them either way. They wouldn’t have stopped just because they couldn’t get their hands on two rare Nekoshou. They were bound to find other test subjects.</strong></p><p><strong>Now to answer some questions that are bound to come.</strong></p><p><strong>Why didn’t Damien save them before and recruit both?</strong></p><p><strong>First, Damien is not exactly a good guy routing for World Peace. What he wants is his own peace first. If that is in danger, he would care less about others.</strong></p><p><strong>Right now he is in a tight position with his cover semi-blown and is in his training montage. No distractions.</strong></p><p><strong>Also, what if he saved one? They would just find another. It will not end until the people behind them are completely removed.</strong></p><p><strong>That’s not Damien’s job.</strong></p><p><strong>If anyone has a problem with Damien’s behaviour, go back to chapter one and check all the Author’s Notes.

    "content": "<p><strong>Disclaimer: I own nothing.</strong></p><p><strong>Chapter 15: Little Cat Sage.</strong></p><p><strong>- Damien –</strong></p><p>I looked at the man sitting opposite to me with a strange….nah, this guy’s looking strange in the rear view mirror, head sitting in front of me and sipping tea.</p><p>The Leader of the Eastern Youkai Faction – The Supreme Commander of the Nura Clan, Nurarihyon.</p><p>He had arrived the very night I sent the message through Kuratabo.</p><p>I mean, sure, I expected him to contact him as soon as he could, but this was fast even for that. It had barely even been a few hours since we brought Akeno back when I was informed that Nurarihyon himself had come up to the place and wanted to meet me.</p><p>It was three in the morning.</p><p>Then again, one of us was an Ayakashi while the other was The Devil. Night was when we did our jobs.</p><p>“I had expected many people when I came here but this… well I can’t say I was expecting a Lucifer to appear here of all places.” He started putting down his cup on the table lightly.</p><p>“Am I not welcome here?” I asked with a slight tilt of the head.</p><p>“Oh nothing of the sort. I haven’t had proper contact with Devils from your family… they are known to be a bit...”</p><p>“Arrogant and insufferable radicals?”</p><p>“Prideful… but sure, whatever you want to use.” He shrugged.</p><p>“Well pride makes us what we are. I will not deny that.” I accepted.</p><p>He then looked at the one who was serving us tea. Unfortunately Gretel didn’t know how to make Japanese tea but Kuroka saved the day as she was taught these things by Magari and came to the rescue.</p><p>Her control over Nature energy was still a bit low but the energy itself was dancing to her tune.</p><p>The Five tails swinging behind her were probably what attracted the elder Youkai’s attention the most.</p><p>He however tactically didn’t ask any questions about her.</p><p>“I got your message from Kurotabo and I’ve got to say I was pleasantly surprised by the content of the entire message, so much so that I thought I had misheard it. So, would you please repeat it for me? I’m afraid that my old memory cannot keep up with everything.”</p><p>This old guy was still a High Ultimate Class to the borderline Satan Class even after being weakened after his fight against Hagoromo Gitsune and he says that his memory cannot keep up with everything… yeah sure.</p><p>“I sent him a message that I can lift the curse on your Clan by Hagoromo Gitsune about your descendants not being able to have children with other Youkai or Ayakashi.”</p><p>He stared at me for a while and then spoke up, “Assuming you can do what it is that you have said, what would be the price of such a thing. I don’t assume that there are such things as free lunches in the world.”</p><p>“Says the guy who never pays for his meals.” I smiled and he returned me one. “I need an alliance. I want an alliance between your Nura Clan and me, not the Lucifer house, not the Devil race… just me and my subordinates.”</p><p>He raised an eyebrow. “Just that?”</p><p>“Well I also want to learn about your Fear and Senjutsu if possible but an alliance is my first priority. There are too many people who are out to make my life annoying, so it’s best to make friends first. I know my or rather my family’s reputation is not a shining example of friendship and all so how about we make a contract, a magical contract stating everything in clear words to lay aside any doubts.”</p><p>He quieted down and thought for a few moments. “In that case, let me see the contract.”</p><p>What followed was a period of discussions that lasted for a couple of hours just for the preliminary contract.</p><p>Nurarihyon will keep my secrets along with the Nura Clan. They will give this territory to Kuroka and support her as she is my subordinate.</p><p>They will teach our people Senjutsu and the Fear system if we can learn it without holding back or intending harm to us in any way.</p><p>In return, we will remove the curse from his family line and support their Clan in a mortal crisis.</p><p>It was a pretty basic contract but we finally managed to iron out the few details.</p><p>I in return made some broker contracts to remove their curses to others.</p><p>It would be pretty easy for him to coerce someone else to sign that contract and wipe away the said being later to finish off the curse.</p><p>He was however sworn to not speak or inform anyone else of my powers in any way either directly or indirectly. This was also a part of the contract.</p><p>“This has been a very good day. I look forward to working with you Damien.” He got up to leave and I accompanied him to the gates.</p><p>“No, no. The pleasure is all ours. If you need anything, please contact Kuroka and she can send me a message. I will contact you myself.”</p><p>“Hahahaha Kuroka is a very talented child. I knew that. But this sudden growth has just… She is very lucky to have a kind and caring master like yourself.”</p><p>“Obviously nyaa, my Master is the best nyaa.” Kuroka purred at the compliment, all five of her tails swinging side to side.</p><p>“That he is. Now, just a piece of friendly advice. I don’t know how you have gained so much power so suddenly but you still don’t have any control over it. Actually I am more surprised with how obedient the nature energy is to you. I have only seen similar affinity in two other beings, Sun Wukong and Inari No Okami herself. Their control and power was far above yours though. No matter how you have gained this ability, train it well and the Youkai can have a new Sage in you. The difference between a normal Youkai and a Sage is enormous, Kuroka. Even the likes of me and Yasaka wouldn’t stand a chance against that old monkey. You on the other hand have chanced upon such an opportunity of a lifetime; don’t let it go to waste. I will ask Magari to handle your training herself and see if I can get in contact with that old monkey to see if he would teach a new Sage. Don’t worry. Your connections will not be revealed. I do have a few favours to cash in here and there and the old monkey is actually a very generous fellow in general.” He explained to me when I looked at him with a questioning gaze.</p><p>“Why though?” I really didn’t understand this.</p><p>He sighed lightly. “You really don’t understand the situation of Japan’s Supernatural World, do you?”</p><p>“I have some ideas but not in much detail. I know that the Youkai Factions are mainly divided into two sides, the Eastern Youkai Faction headed by the Nura Clan and the Western Youkai Faction headed by the Nine-Tailed Fox Yasaka. There are obviously several other groups like the Shikoku Youkai but they don’t have a major hold on the land. The Human sides are divided among the Onmyojis around Kyoto and the Five Principal Clans, the latter of which have the Blessings of the Shinto Deities and possess the Five Divine Beasts. Then there is the Shinto Faction itself, headed by Lady Amaterasu. Obviously there are many encroachments by the Abrahamic Factions but they are not really major players from what I am told. Did I miss anything?”</p><p>“Hmm, that’s more or less accurate. Although, there is still Yomi and Lady Izanagi but let’s leave that aside for a different time. The relationships between all these factions are very complicated. The Onmyojis were more or less non-clan people who were brought to prominence by Abe no Seimei, the son of Hagoromo Gitsune. He was planning to resurrect himself into a higher being and break through his limits by using a certain ritual. I had fought and stopped the ritual back during my youth and met my wife then. Ah, those were the days. *<em>Cough Cough</em>* So in general, the Onmyojis are in a way looked down upon by the Five Principal Clan members who were directly blessed by the Shinto Gods. They do everything to make sure this part is known. Any unblessed member of the Principal Clans or any born with a Sacred Gear is ostracised or directly exiled. Huh? What’s with that look on your face?”</p><p>“Ah, you see….” I went on to explain what had happened a few moments ago to the man.</p><p>“Yes….that does sound like them. Still to think they would have the guts to walk into my territory, even with Hihi dead and to hunt such a child….they surely don’t know their limits. Don’t worry. From the agreement we have, presided by Lady Amaterasu herself, they are not allowed inside the Youkai territory, especially the ones in the Eastern side which contain a greater proportion of Ayakashi. This happened after an almost country-wide civil war happened when an idiot from the Five Principal Clans had killed the son of a prominent Youkai Faction, a Dog Youkai, Inuragi with fifty nine demons behind him. Even after the murder, their attitude was like killing a bug and that pissed off the Youkai a lot. The Dog Youkai are very loyal and thus many Youkai Clans had gathered to help them. The Shinra Clan would have been left in tatters even if the Youkais would have died under the attacks of Byakko. This was however stopped by a timely intervention of Lady Amaterasu who punished the guilty and drew up a treaty for us. The areas between the Clans and the Youkai were finely divided and they were banned from entering the area belonging to the Youkai Faction. If they did break this rule… I will take care of any backlash from their side. After all this was their fault. As for the Devils… they will not hear anything from me. That’s the best I can do for you.”</p><p>“That will be enough. My thanks for this.” I gave a bow.</p><p>“So back to the politics of the Japanese Supernatural World. Our Youkai Factions, while under the Shinto Pantheon as a whole, are its own independent factions. Lady Amaterasu doesn’t interfere directly in our rules, less so for me than Yasaka-hime as she is Lady Amaterasu’s Miko. This setting does give us a high degree of autonomy but it also comes with its own share of drawbacks. We don’t get any support from the Shinto Pantheon. We have to depend on our own strengths. This is the same case with the Youkai in China and other countries. Thus older Youkai like the old monkey Sun Wukong often help promising youngsters among Youkai so as to build a backing for the Youkai in the world. Do you think that anyone would dare to look down on Youkai and Ayakashi if we had one of the Top Ten Strongest Beings in the world? Any Devil would dare to be so brazen about forcing Youkai into their peerages if we had a stronger backing?”</p><p>I listened to the old man and tried to find lies in his statement.</p><p>I found none and he continued.</p><p>“Even if Kuroka is your subordinate, as long as she is a Youkai, her identity alone would help us. The same is the case with Shirone. If these two can become as strong as ‘The Victorious Fighting Buddha’ or ‘Lady Inari’, someone who can trounce any Devils except the anomalies with ease, our faction will be more secure. The strong Youkai should protect the weak youkai. This is the philosophy I believe in. This is why I created the Nura Clan in the first place.”</p><p>No lies.</p><p>Starting from the very start of this speech, he did not lie.</p><p>Well, this kind of trust is something I can reciprocate.</p><p>“If that’s the case then please do help Kuroka. I give you my full support. As for Shirone, she is very young right now. It is better that she trains normally. I will arrange something for her when it is safe for her to make the jump. The method Kuroka used might not be good for her at this time because of her age.”</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>I wonder if the Negative Fruits will be of any use to the Ayakashi since they are beings that thrive on negative feelings like fear of others.</p><p>But it’s better to leave it for later.</p><p>We discussed several things. I got to know of several pieces of history that I didn’t know about.</p><p>Like, Yasaka was assigned the territory of Kyoto by Amaterasu after Nurarihyon had defeated Hagoromo Gitsune and the throne of Kyoto had been empty. It needed a Nine Tailed Fox to control and manage the Leylines so Amaterasu sent her own Miko to manage the territory of Kyoto. She has since then led the Kyoto Youkai. Another thing was that Hagoromo Gitsune had eaten Nurarihyon’s heart during that battle and this had led to him becoming weaker over time and age much faster than any other Ayakashi of his strength would. That’s a wound that hasn’t healed even now or he would have been stronger than his current self.</p><p><strong>- Scene Change –</strong></p><p>I didn’t have any Binder Marks to my name. All thirteen of them were used.</p><p>Vienna, Gretel, Ophelia, Cleria, Charlene, Victoria, Helena, Alicia, Lavinia, Kuroka, Shirone, Akeno and finally Rias.</p><p>Even the one I kept in case of emergencies was one but I guess this did count for an emergency.</p><p>Having an in with the New Satan other than Charlene would be helpful. I do remember that Rias was still one of the strongest devils of her generation. The only two who were stronger than her were Sairaorg and Vali, both of whom had a very rough childhood that forced them to become stronger. That said, with less than a year of training, she could defeat Grendel, an Evil Dragon which was a solid Ultimate Class in strength. Furthermore she fought Grayfia to a standstill in the Azazel cup.</p><p>While I do remember her getting a lot of hate, people always ignore the positive facts more often than not. She did face Riser’s entire peerage with only four of her own and one of them was a newbie and almost took out everyone. As someone who hadn’t ever participated in a Rating Game that was quite an achievement. As for the issues of her peerage, I blame it on her parents. It is an adult’s job to help children in their house with such problems. One cannot expect a teenager to know about complex psychological problems. The fact that she got them to open up was already more than one could say for anyone. The last but probably the most important part was the loyalty for her peerage. That’s a thing rarely found in others. While she did want to win the game, she gave it up, not defeated although that might have ultimately been the result but gave up the game when threatened with the life of her peerage member. A selfish person would have fought till the end out of sheer stubbornness. Although the result could have been completely different if this fight had taken place when it was actually supposed to happen.</p><p>I wouldn’t say that she didn’t have her faults but she was probably and surprisingly the most <em>normal/sane</em> person among all her peerage members with a little bit of proper guidance, she could become someone really amazing. I just need to provide her with a proper incentive.</p><p>I on the other hand had always disliked Akeno because she actually held back in that Rating Game, even when her best friend’s, her King’s future was at stake, she still clung to her fucking pride and unwarranted hatred of her blood. That was borderline traitorous for someone like me. The worst part was that she was never blamed for it.</p><p>Shirone was afraid that she would lose control and hurt her peerage. This was also to blame on the devil’s that spread the false information about Senjutsu causing madness. Kiba fought with all he had. Only Akeno held back even when she could have single-handedly changed the entire outcome of the game.</p><p>Anyways, that was in a different world. I was looking at a completely different Akeno, someone who my cute little gremlin has taken a shine to. I just need to make sure that she is straightened up. Maybe give her to Gretel who has the experience with this kind of thing or Cleria. Ah, Ophelia also works as a Psychiatrist because of her ‘Bewitching Voice’. She needs to take a look at her first.</p><p>She does have potential. In fact, she has a lot of potential, I wouldn’t deny that. But all that potential is only good in the hands of a mentally stable individual.</p><p>“You know Boss,” Sean called out from beside me, breaking my train of thoughts.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>“You could have been in great trouble when you made that deal?” he continued with a smirk.</p><p>“Oh? and how is that so?” I asked, smiling.</p><p>“If they had agreed to it and just left, you would have been stuck in the place and left helpless.” He smirked.</p><p>“Ah, you realised that…”</p><p>“I did. Thankfully they didn’t.”</p><p>“But it wouldn’t have changed the outcome regardless. If they had tried to leave, Gretel would have killed them on the spot.”</p><p>…</p><p>I looked at his dumbfounded look and smirked. “I said I wouldn’t take help from Musashi, Vienna and you. I <em>never</em> said anything about Gretel who was behind them the entire time.”</p><p>He looked at Gretel who nodded slightly.</p><p>I couldn’t make my words more obvious because they would have doubted that there was something wrong with the deal so I had to improvise.</p><p>“Gretel… please have Akeno go through health checkups and explain everything to her and then take her to sessions with Ophelia. She has gone through a lot of mental trauma. These things can scar people for life. It would be good if Ophelia took a look at her. I will explain her situation to Ophelia myself.”</p><p>“Yes Master.” My cute maid bowed and escorted both Vienna and Akeno out of the room.</p><p>Sean scooted near me and whispered. “Say Boss.”</p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p>“So if Boss Lady was there… didn’t she hear about that…”</p><p>I raised an eyebrow.</p><p>“I mean… you know <em>that</em>… about you ‘taking a peek’ thing that the shorty said.” He whispered.</p><p>Ah…</p><p>“What! Don’t tell me you didn’t realise that.”</p><p>“Vienna was just being jealous. Gretel would know that.” Yes. My little maid is very understanding.</p><p>“Now you are just deluding yourself.” He sighed and slumped on the other side of the couch, eyes closed.</p><p>I looked to the corner of the room where a Magic Circle appeared and Merlin walked out of it. I had sent him to inform Azazel about this incident and that Akeno was now staying with me.</p><p>Merlin sat down, took a breath and started, “Azazel was surprised that we even met her. Apparently the Himejima had spread the news about her among the Devils and wanted to throw her to them which would have more often than not led to her death, a less likely scenario was for the Devils to reincarnate her as a Devil herself, either way she would be out and the Fallen Angels wouldn’t be able to blame them either. Fortunately Sirzechs had heard of this and contacted Azazel who had asked him to help her out as some… unsavoury elements among the Fallen Angels were acting up. Her life would have been in danger if she had entered Grigori. He didn’t mind that she ended up with us, just that he wouldn’t have to owe Sirzechs a favour and all.”</p><p>The Fallen and Barakiel couldn’t raise a big fuss about Shuri because she was technically still a member of their clan but killing Akeno would have been the straw that broke the camel’s back. I had often thought that it was weird that Akeno was able to escape from their chase for an entire year. These bastards were just leading her till they found a shoulder to fire the gun with.</p><p>“So no actions against the Himejima Clan members?” Sean asked.</p><p>Merlin actually sighed. “The matters are not so simple. The previous host of Suzaku, the Vermillion Bird is on her deathbed and the Divine Beast was going to choose its new host. Shuri Himejima, despite what those old bastards said, was one of the top contenders for being chosen before being driven away. She did after all carry the blessing of the Shinto Deities and the blood of their clan – all the conditions needed to become the new host of the Divine Beast, Suzaku...”</p><p>“And they were worried that she would side with the Fallen.” I asked.</p><p>“That too but this was not all. Akeno… also possessed the blessing of the Shinto Gods, her spiritual powers that she used for exorcism were proof of this. The Vermillion Bird chose the best possible host for itself who would be able to harness its power to the fullest. It doesn’t really care about their race as long as they had the blessing of the Shinto Deities. This caused them to be afraid.”</p><p>“Because with her Fallen Angel Heritage, Akeno would most likely inherit the Vermillion Bird and the Fallen would then claim her, most likely robbing a Divine Beast away legally, somewhat. Even if Azazel himself didn’t want it, other more radical ones would have shouted for it. If she were to die however or somehow be turned into a Devil, a being of demonic nature, the Vermillion Bird wouldn’t touch her, blessing of the Shinto Deities or not. That was quite smart of them.” I thought over the information closely.</p><p>The Himejima were on the cusp of losing their Divine Beast, the source of their clan, so they had to take drastic actions even risking the wrath of a Fallen Angel like Barakiel to do so.</p><p>However the question remained, what happens now that I have taken Akeno with me?</p><p>I haven’t turned her into a Devil. Will the Vermillion Bird really seek her out?</p><p>Now, that was a massive headache.</p><p>I should have killed those bastards, when I had the chance.</p><p>Should I make Cleria or someone else reincarnate her with their Evil Pieces?</p><p>“You are thinking about reincarnating her with Evil Pieces.” Merlin asked me.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Why? Why even do that? From what I know, they lost their end of the deal and Akeno to you. They cannot even claim her now. If she gets the Vermillion Bird, it would be a proper slap to their faces.” Sean spoke up.</p><p>“A slap and a political mess.” Merlin countered.</p><p> A political mess, alright. That’s one way to see it.</p><p>There were always reasons for actions. Thinking about it from the Himejima’s point of view, leaving their Clan’s source in the hands of unstable elements was foolishness and that much even I could agree upon. As the Clan leader, Suou Himejima, did have the responsibility to prevent such a thing from happening. Sure there could have been other ways but a leader wouldn’t leave such things to chance. This also explained why they only attacked Shuri and Akeno after such a long time.</p><p>The world is so same and yet so different from what I had read.</p><p>Things were not simply black or white here but rather different shades of grey.</p><p>If I remember correctly, they had attacked Shuri on the day of the ceremony where the Divine Beast was transferred. There was a change in this world.</p><p><strong>- Venelana Gremory –</strong></p><p>Venelana took the dinner to her daughter’s room.</p><p>Rias had missed her food twice in a row now. She was starting to get worried; especially since it was after she had come from that incident.</p><p>Agrippa was questioned thoroughly and he didn’t say anything negative about… that person. She still felt her spine chill at the calamity they had avoided.</p><p>Souji had reported that the assassination was successful. It was disguised as an inside job by the rebels.</p><p>The problem had been when they tried to find the… him. That face was something that was engraved in their minds already as someone who deserved the utmost respect since their childhoods and even now, even after knowing that it was not the same person, she couldn’t bring the name to her lips… and she was supposed to be the mother of the current Lucifer… What an irony.</p><p>She remembered the boy’s comment about the rest being normal devils while he being The Devil and had to agree that there was a bit of truth to that statement.</p><p>The area where the incident had occurred was under a new Youkai. Nurarihyon was extremely tight lipped about it, only saying that she was an ally of his and not a subordinate but one that they would support no matter what. That statement had made his stance more than clear on this matter.</p><p>Souji and Mathers were forced to return. They did go to introduce themselves to the new owner of the territory and everyone was currently waiting for their return and report.</p><p>She knocked on the door and entered the room only to find an unbelievable sight in front of her eyes.</p><p>Rias was at her study table, a book of magic opened in front of her.</p><p>She slowly walked up to her and placed the plate of food on the table and sat by her side.</p><p>“What is all this, Rias?”</p><p>“Ah… mother! I… I was studying.”</p><p>“I can see that but, why did you skip your meals?”</p><p>She realised as her eyes widened slightly. “You didn’t realise?”</p><p>She took her daughter in her embrace and caressed her head softly. “Do you want to talk about that day?”</p><p>“Umm…”</p><p>“I know something’s been bothering you Rias. You have been in a daze since you returned. So, tell me about what you are thinking.”</p><p>“I… I wanted a friend. I thought she could become my peerage member and then we could be friends. I am happy that she is safe but also a little disappointed.”</p><p>She held out a sigh. It was the fate of people of their birth status to be cut off from most of the world, for their safety. This however made the children very lonely. It was one of the reasons why they doted on them so much, the rarity of birth being the other. Sirzechs hoped for the same.</p><p>“We cannot have everything in the world, Rias. Most of the time, we have to face disappointment. Even things we get, we need to work hard for them. Now tell me, why the sudden studying. Not that I am not pleased with it but I would like my curiosity sated.”</p><p>“I… those people and that Vienna girl were fighting so hard to save the girl. I… couldn’t do anything. She looked even younger than me and yet she was so cool.” Venealana sighed inwardly. She had thought of this. After all, what child would be unaffected by such an incident? Rias wasn’t taught to fight and kill yet.</p><p>Such an incident might be a shock to her, not to mention the strengths of those people, even if the said people were… them.</p><p>“And then there was him.” Rias continued and Venelana suddenly noticed the change in her daughter’s entire demeanour. “He was so cool, mother. He walked so calmly and then he just looked at one of the bad guys and the bad guy fainted, even foaming from his mouth. He even blasted off the Vienna girl’s cool armour with the flick of a finger. That was so awesome. You should have seen it. The girl wasn’t even hurt by that. It was like straight out of a manga.”</p><p>She found her mouth slightly open at her daughter gushing about who could literally be the descendant of the Devil. She understood it. Lucifer always commanded a charisma that everyone was attracted to. If he hadn’t been with Lilith alone, there would probably have been scores of girls lined up to be with him. In terms of charm, he was above even Asmodeus, who was a Sex Demon, the literal personification of lust. Then again Lucifer was the Angel of Desires before he rebelled. Other people being attracted to him were not that unexpected of a thing.</p><p>“… and then he blew slightly and all that fire was completely blown away. You should have looked at it Mother. Even Agrippa was having trouble making a barrier and we weren’t even close. One of his people helped us make a barrier instead and he… he just stood there, it was so awesome.” Her daughter quieted down to take a breath and Venelana noticed the slight flush on her daughter’s face.</p><p>Oh Satan.</p><p>“Rias.”</p><p>“Umm.”</p><p>“What do you think about him?”</p><p>“He is very cool and so courteous. Not like those kids from the other Pillar Houses who always try to pull each other’s legs when they can.”</p><p>“Do you like him?”</p><p>…</p><p>“MOTHER!...”</p><p>“It’s not that much of a surprise dear. From what I have heard and seen, he is quite a looker and was very strong and courteous as you have just stated, so do you like him?” she asked.</p><p>Her daughter fidgeted and her feelings couldn’t be any more obvious.</p><p>“I… might… maybe… just a bit… maybe slightly.” she whispered towards the end.</p><p><em>Sigh</em></p><p>This time she couldn’t hold her sigh.</p><p>While her daughter having a new crush would have been adorable and she would spend months teasing her about this, the person in question was anything but ordinary.</p><p>She had to address this while things were still in control.</p><p>“Rias.” Her daughter looked up and she continued, “Do you know who he was?”</p><p>“He… was Lucifer, right? I mean not Onii-sama but the previous one? I mean he had twelve wings. I have read about that in my books and lessons.”</p><p>“His descendant, but yes.”</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>She thought of the words to explain to her daughter about the politics but, a child of her age? So she changed her approach.</p><p>“He probably has many other girls who like him. You did tell me about another girl that his sister talked about, right?” she asked.</p><p>Rias nodded.</p><p>“They were all strong from what I could guess.”</p><p>She nodded again.</p><p>“So you can understand that it will be hard following him. If you nurture that feeling, there is a high chance that you might be in for disappointment later in your life and… and that will hurt more than what it did today.”</p><p>She watched her daughter become quiet. It was cruel of her to shatter her daughter’s hopes like this but it would be for the better lest she not face a much cruel one later.</p><p>….</p><p>She watched as Rias became quiet for a bit.</p><p>“It’s alri….”</p><p>“Mother.”</p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p>“I want to become stronger.”</p><p>Venelana felt her heart miss a beat when she saw her daughter’s eyes. “What?”</p><p>“I lost a chance to have a peerage member and a friend today and it felt bad. I don’t want to feel that bad again… especially not without trying. I want to become stronger. Those people were so strong. If they can become so strong, then I can too. Please. I don’t want to lose next time.”</p><p>Her words died in her mouth. Perhaps that was not the correct way to make her daughter give up on something.</p><p>At least something good could come out of it.</p><p>She could get her to train. As for the childish crush of hers, that would fade away in time. After all, how often would she see the Devil’s literal look-alike descendant?</p><p>In the meantime she could get something else from her daughter.</p><p>A Devil always made deals.</p><p>“In that case, you need to promise me to not tell anyone else about what happened on that day. There are many people who would want to get to him, whether for good or bad purposes. So, promise me that you will not tell anyone about that incident and we will have a deal.”</p><p>“Deal.” Her daughter cheered up.</p><p>Well, it had been a few hundred years since she trained someone. Sirzechs had needed little to no help with his power. Rias needed her more.</p><p>“Then first things first, eat your dinner. I want you up at five O’ Clock next morning. I don’t like slackers for my students.”</p><p>“YES MOTHER!” the adorable little thing saluted and she found a smile on her own face.</p><p><strong>- Nurarihyon –</strong></p><p>He watched as Rikuo left the room, the taint of Hagoromo Gitsune’s curse fading away from his spirit. Looking at the contract in his hands, he laughed. Making a Deal with the Devil, a term that was used to scare people just like the Youkai. In a way both of them are quite similar. Both evil beings, hated and persecuted by humans, hunted by exorcists and defamed all around the world. This was one of the reasons why he didn’t mind making this deal.</p><p>He did realise that the boy was far different than normal Devils.</p><p>He had after all met the one who was using the Lucifer name to rule the Devils currently and while a humble fellow, he… didn’t have… that fire. The presence of the King that the mere teenage child exuded just by sitting in front of him. The new Lucifer was… more like a warrior, a very strong one at that, a politician maybe, a good man no doubt, but… he wasn’t a King, one of the reasons why he was browbeaten by his so-called council so often.</p><p>While he might not have seen the original Lucifer, if he was like this or even stronger, he could see how someone like that established an entire race by himself.</p><p>The door slid lightly and he felt a presence enter the room.</p><p>“I take it that you have already met both your apprentices?” he asked, pouring out tea for both of them.</p><p>“I did.” She picked up the cup and took a sip of her tea. “You could have warned me. I almost had a heart attack when I sensed her power. I was fully convinced that it was someone else disguised as her. Those three extra tails and the Nature energy all around her, do you know how this happened? All I got from her was that it was her Master’s gift and she refused to say anything beyond that. I didn’t force her to talk about it.”</p><p>“That was probably for the best knowing who their Master is.”</p><p>“So you know him?”</p><p>“I did. I met him yesterday. He had sent a message through Kurotabō that he could remove Hagoromo Gitsune’s curse from my bloodline.”</p><p>Magari spit out her tea and he felt a smirk light up his face. This was exactly what he was waiting for.</p><p>“You….HE WHAT!”</p><p>“He offered to remove Hagoromo Gitsune’s curse from my bloodline.”</p><p>“That’s bullshit. We have already tried everything we could during Rihan’s time. There was nothing we could do to break it. Even Yasaka-Hime was unable to do that and the Shinto wouldn’t participate in such squabbles according to that stuck up bunch, only acting high and mighty when it suits them. How could a teenage devil boy, no matter how influential, do something like that? He must have wanted something from you.” She scoffed and took another sip of her tea while vanishing the spill-out from earlier.</p><p>“Oh that he did. By the way, the curse is gone.”</p><p>She did another spit-take.</p><p>This time she didn’t wait for anything and jumped at him, her Senjutsu and Youjutsu spells flashing as she scanned all his body. Her eyes widened with each spell that she cast until she was left with an open mouth staring at him. “This… How? We tried so hard, for so long? How can… so easily? Just who is this boy, Nurari?”</p><p>“He is The Devil.”</p><p>“Which house? What is his name? Kuroka and Shirone absolutely refuse to open their mouths. The one who passed them to me was an unknown devil. I did try but I couldn’t find any trace of them anywhere when they left to meet their Master. I gave up trying after a few times. I believe they were using some special kind of magic or maybe some sort of artifact for travelling from place to place and hiding their traces and bases.”</p><p>“I would think so. As for which house, I already said, he was… The Devil.”</p><p>The reality finally settled in as she realised the identity of the person.</p><p>“Sirzechs Lucifer?”</p><p>Or not.</p><p>“No… the real one. This one was the real deal, not just someone using the name to rule.”</p><p>“The Lucifer house… why?” She got up from her place and started pacing around the room. Magari was always cool and composed in front of others but she was just as excitable in private. “They have stayed out of all worldly affairs for a long time… then why? Why would a Lucifer take Fujimai’s children under his wings? This… I don’t understand it. He dispelled your curse, what did he ask for? You said he wanted something? What did he want?”</p><p>“He wanted an alliance with us and his subordinates, a couple of people to be taught about Senjutsu, Youjutsu and our Fear. This guy was apparently cutting off ties from his family or at least trying to and needed a helping hand. This was his offer. I accepted it, especially after seeing what he had done to Kuroka? Did you find any abnormalities in her? I am not an expert in Senjutsu so I couldn’t check them properly. As for his trustworthiness, he offered a magical contract which I signed. I cannot reveal his methods of curse removal to anyone. But here’s the contract.” He placed the contract on the table for her to view. She was after all his Vice Commander.</p><p>“Oh.” She sat back down upon hearing about the contract and viewed it. “This… this seems quite simple.” She checked it further with her spells.</p><p>“I know. But I can assure you it is very much a binding contract.”</p><p>She closed the contract and handed it over to him and composed herself again. “I checked Kuroka obviously. There was nothing wrong with her except a certain bit of cockiness that she seemed to be growing. When I did mention it however, she winced. It seems that despite her growth, she was supposedly trashed around when she tried using her powers to show off. Would do her a lot of good. Her power grew quite a bit and her affinity with nature energy is nothing short of astonishing. I have only seen such an affinity in Sun Wukong and Inari-sama before. Her control however is a mess. It seems that she still hasn’t caught up with her increase in power. I believe that she will gain another tail if she can control all of her power and master it. There were no backlashes or injuries from whatever procedure was used. The most surprising thing was probably… how clear her power felt. There wasn’t a shred of malice in that power. It was honestly invigorating to just sit by her side. I believe that even sitting by her side would increase the speed at which people can learn Senjutsu because of the lack of malice interrupting their minds by pushing violent stray thoughts into them. It is as if someone has forcibly given her all of a Sage’s powers but forgot to give her the knowledge and control that came with it. Shirone on the other hand was completely fine, if not a bit excited about becoming stronger herself.”</p><p><a href=\"https://“Hmm….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">“Hmm….it</a> is fine then.”</p><p>“Do you think we could trade for the method that was used for Kuroka?” she asked in a hopeful tone.</p><p>“Would you trade such a method if you had one?” he replied in an even tone. It was the reason why he didn’t even bother to ask for this. Maybe in the future, if they got further in their alliance, he could offer the same help to one of his subordinates but even hoping for that was like making castles in the sky. He looked at the lost eyes of his Vice Commander and shook his head. “Forget about it. Concentrate on the fact that he is helping out Kuroka and Shirone. We can have two new Sages after probably an entire millennia. If they could reach the level of the previous ones, the position of Youkai all over the world would be stabilised. Messing up this deal because of a moment of greed would be a matter of great foolishness that would make us the sinners of all of Youkai kind.” He took another sip of his now cold tea. “Teach her everything you can. I will contact the old monkey and inform him about her. Her information is bound to get out due to the recent events and having the old monkey’s support behind them would deter any stray eyes towards a young child, providing her an extra layer of protection.”</p><p>“What recent events?” she asked.</p><p>He sighed… and went on to explain all the details. He was actually thankful that the boy hadn’t hidden anything about it which made it much easier to manage.</p><p>“I sent Okita Souji back who came for information on the new owner of that territory. The devil’s side is also spooked from the appearance of the new Lucifer.”</p><p> “The Himejima? I heard that some Himejima people were killed in their own territory last night.”</p><p>“Last night?” he asked, surprised.</p><p>“Yes. It seemed to be an internal feud and their bodies were found a little distance away from their clans. Do you think the boy…”</p><p>“I was with him last night so it couldn’t have been him so the only ones… Oh! Who would have thought that the pretty boy had that in him? Maybe I was wrong about him after all.” he thought with a hand on his chin. “It seems they want to hide his existence.”</p><p>“Do you think they are trying to…”</p><p>“Kill him? No… that would the height of foolishness not to mention suicidal. That boy would tear them apart with his bare hands. My instincts were shouting at me to run away when I first met him. I haven’t had this kind of feeling even against Hagoromo Gitsune. This was the kind of overwhelming feeling someone like the Old Monkey gave me when I had challenged him all those years ago. Compared to that, while Okita Souji is experienced, he is just not upto the mark. My guess is that they are just trying to meet and know of his stance now that a Lucifer has come out into the open. Still, keep an eye on Kuroka in case they try to contact her. They are in their full rights to contact the owner of their neighbouring territory.”</p><p>“Hmm, I will go to them after this meeting.”</p><p>They talked a lot after that.</p><p>“I have found out about some disturbing news, Magari.”</p><p>“What news?”</p><p>“The remnants of Hagoromo Gitsune’s people are on the move. There have been bits and pieces but the work and style is exactly like theirs. Difficult times are coming around. The training of the kids needs to be started in earnest. I will go for a meeting with Yasaka-Hime and talk to her about the current situation.”</p><p>A period of silence prevailed in the room.</p><p>“I will send out my people to collect the information.” She replied before getting up.</p><p>“Tell them to take care. The enemies this time are not what these children are used to facing.”</p><p>“I will.”</p><p><strong>- Okita Souji -</strong></p><p>Souji was not having a good day. First was the urgent order from the mistress to assassinate the members of the Himejima Clan which included their leader and disguise it as an accident.</p><p>The task had gone off surprisingly easy as he had struck them when they were unprepared and exhausted and didn't put up much of a fight after their strongest was taken down unaware. </p><p>And perhaps he exhausted all his luck in that fight.</p><p>Nurarihyon had been no help at all. He had downright stated that this territory was a gift to an ally and he wouldn't give out any information about them. The old youkai might have aged but his stubbornness was still like his youth. He didn't force the situation either knowing what was at stake so Mathers suggested that they meet the owner of the territory herself as neighbours. Nobody could blame them for this. </p><p>And thus they were here, as an envoy from the Gremory House to greet the new owner of the territory. He spotted a youkai, he had known from when he met with Lord Hihi, the previous owner, may he rest in peace. \"Koshiro-dono, nice to meet you again after such a long time.\"</p><p>\"Souji-sama! What a surprise? How did you find your way here? Is everything alright?\" Koshiro, the attendant of Lord Hihi greeted him back. </p><p>\"We recently found out about Lord Hihi's departure and came to offer our condolences as well as to greet the new owner of the territory. It is only general etiquette to greet one's neighbours.\"</p><p>He greeted the man and they exchanged pleasantries with each other. </p><p>\"Yes, Lord Hihi's passing away was sudden. Those damn Shikoku Youkai.\" He growled. \"It was thanks to Rikuo-sama and his attendants that they were driven off from this area. Our new leader Miss Kuroka fought them too and took out six of their stronger fighters by herself. It is very reassuring to have her here especially after the void left by Lord Hihi.\"</p><p>\"I had gotten some whispers about the war but couldn't get the full details. Was it a full scale assault from the Shikoku? Inugamigyōbu Danuki, from what I had heard he was retired?\" He asked, trying to figure out some more information about the matter. </p><p>\"It was his son Inugamigyōbu Tamazuki who had the dreams of capturing the Nura Clan and then aim for the rest of the world… Newborn calf really doesn't fear the Tiger. \"</p><p>\"Indeed. The whole world? Did any of the older ones even make a move?\"</p><p>\"It was the younger generation. Inugamigyōbu Danuki-sama himself came and apologised. He wasn't aware of the incident and had found out from the Supreme Commander. Their side was heavily damaged however so we didn't continue the fight either.\"</p><p>\"That was very wise of Nurarihyon-sama. By the way, can you tell me something about the new owner? I wouldn't want to offend her by saying something I shouldn't.\"</p><p>\"Gahahaha no worries there Souji-sama. Miss Kuroka is a very kind person.\"</p><p>\"Yes nyaa. My Onee-chan is very nice nyaa.\" Their conversation was interrupted by the voice of a new arrival.</p><p>A young white haired Nekomata child, no, this one seemed a little different. A Nekoshou! How rare. He didn't know of many that existed nowadays.</p><p>\"Shirone-chan! What are you doing here? I thought you were being punished for chasing the exorcist?\" Koshiro inquired to which the child flushed. </p><p>\"I didn't get punished nyaa. Onee-chan gave me some money to eat fish because I completed my training after that.\" She explained with a fluster getting brighter towards the end. Unfortunately her tail couldn't fool anyone. </p><p>\"Heh… The fish were indeed nice when I saw them a while ago.\"</p><p>\"They were? \"</p><p>\"Hmm. You like fish don't you?\"</p><p>\"I do nyaa. \"</p><p>\"I believe they were making sushi with them. You like Sushi, don't you?\"</p><p>The little girl drooled slightly and nodded, \"I do nyaa. \"</p><p>\"Sushi is tasty, isn't it? \"</p><p>\"It is nyaa.\"</p><p>\"Kuroka-sama's spankings hurt, didn't they?\"</p><p>\"It did nyaa. I couldn't even sit properly… Ah, you tricked me.\"</p><p>\"Gahahahaha.\"</p><p>\"Are you the sister of Miss Kuroka, the new owner of this territory?\" Souki greeted the child. It was probably the best chance to acquire information about them. He might not like tricking a child but the current situation didn't give him much of a choice.</p><p>\"I am Shirone, nyaa. What do you want from my Nee-sama?</p><p>“Good day Miss Shirone. I wanted to meet your sister and congratulate her for becoming the new owner of this territory. My master’s family owns the nearby territory and we hope to establish a friendship between us.” he smiled inwardly watching the girl trying to act like a grown up.</p><p>“Oh. Okay, good luck nyaa. I need to get the fish before they run out. Bye.” </p><p>“Ah, Miss I was hoping you could guide me to your sister.”</p><p>“Hah?” The girl stopped and looked back confused.</p><p>“Why don’t I guide you there myself, Okita Souji.” he heard a voice behind him and forcibly had to stop himself from drawing his sword.</p><p>Someone who could sneak behind him this easily could be counted on fingers in these parts of the world. He turned around and saw a Blackhaired Nekomata Youkai whose most prominent feature seemed to be the seven dancing tails behind her. Magari, the Vice Commander of the Nura Clan and probably the strongest member of the Clan since Nurarihyon himself was weakened since his fight with Hagoromo Gitsune.</p><p>“Ah. Sensei. You are back.”</p><p>“Go back to your training, Shirone.”</p><p>“B-but Sensei, I just finished my training for the day and the fish…”</p><p>“Koshiro will get you your fish. In the meanwhile, I have something new for you to practise. Get going.” she commanded leaving no room for argument.</p><p>This would be a bit harder than he had expected.</p><p>“Magari-sama, what a pleasure to meet you. I had no idea that she was your student. You seem to have gotten a very good successor.”</p><p>“It was the blessings of Lady Amaterasu. I assume that you are here to visit Kuroka?”</p><p>“Yes Magari-sama.”</p><p>“Then come, I will take you there myself. I hope that won’t be a problem.</p><p>“Certainly not.”</p><p>He was led into the mansion at the corner of the residential area of the town. He could sense the entire place teeming with Youkai and Ayakashi.</p><p>He was a pretty deft hand at Touki but his Senjutsu capabilities weren’t anything to write home about yet even he had to stop for a moment when he sensed the aura around the mansion. It was like a whirlpool of Nature Energy surrounding the place and continuously flowing all around the place.</p><p>“Follow me.” she instructed.</p><p>“Where’s Kuroka?” She asked a nearby maid.</p><p>“Ah Magari-sama. Miss Kuroka is training.”</p><p>“Inform her to meet us in the meeting room. There are guests.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“She will be here in a moment. Please make yourself comfortable till then.” She led him to the meeting room, a Japanese style room with the view of a garden on the side.</p><p>They sat in silence while Souji cursed his luck again. Nurarihyon had anticipated the move and sent his Vice Commander who also turned out to be their teacher.</p><p>Was she also related to the new Lucifer?</p><p>He wished Mathers was here instead of trying to search for their clues in the nearby territories. He was good at these things.</p><p>He didn’t have to wait long because soon enough, a young girl around 13 or 14 years old entered the room. She had black hair, golden eyes and surprisingly five tails swinging behind her. What was even more surprising was the Nature Energy dancing around her. Okita believed that he didn’t need to be an expert at Senjutsu to notice the power moving around her body.</p><p>A Sage?</p><p>He winced inwardly at the complications.</p><p>The Youkai would launch a war if someone like this was touched by any faction. It was similar to someone touching young Master Millicas for the Devil faction. </p><p>There went his chance to try and use politics to resolve this.</p><p>The girl herself was not weak either. An Ultimate Class from just a look and Senjutsu users were always a pain to fight against.</p><p>Then again how and why would the new Lucifer be connected to such a person? Are the Youkai really that close to this guy?</p><p>He pushed aside his thoughts and greeted the girl in front of him.</p><p>“Greetings, Miss Kuroka. I am Okita Souji, representing the Gremory family to congratulate you on becoming the owner of this territory. We hope to establish friendship as we had with Lord Hihi.”</p><p>“Okita Souji? I think I remember that name. Weren’t you the Knight of the new Satan? I thought that the new Satans were supposed to have no families. Wasn’t that the reason why the previous ones were all but exiled? And… yet here you are representing a family? I wonder if all those talks about neutrality were just propaganda to disguise a rebellion.” the girl asked in a very playful tone but Okita felt his muscles tighten up. A single slip up to such kinds of meetings could be used against them. Even if it was just a casual statement.</p><p>“Kuroka.” Magari called out in a stern tone.</p><p>“My apologies Magari-sensei. I am a bit uninformed about the other factions. It was just a curious thought. I didn’t mean anything by it. You didn’t mind it, did you, Souji-sama?”</p><p>“No. Certainly not. My Master sent me because of the recent incident here to resolve any misunderstandings that might have been caused previously.”</p><p>“So you are not here to congratulate me? Ah, how disappointing.”</p><p>“No Miss. That was certainly not my intention. My Master and I didn’t mean any disrespect.”</p><p>“Yes. What was your Master’s name again? I don’t remember whose peerage member you were. Sorry Magari-sensei, I haven’t been able to catch up with my studies yet. I promise to catch up with them as soon as possible.”</p><p>He heard Magari sigh and it was not as if he didn’t understand it himself. This girl was teasing him on purpose. At such times he really wished others took these kinds of missions. Someone like Mathers, Grayfia-sama or even Bewoulf or Enku would be much more adept than someone like him.</p><p>“My Master is the Crimson Satan, Sirzechs who currently wields the title of Lucifer, the Head of Domestic Affairs of the Devil faction.” he noticed that the girl’s eyes crinkle slightly at the reply. Thankfully they were already prepared for such questions by many others.</p><p>This girl wouldn’t be the first one to take such jabs.</p><p>“Then please speak. I don’t wish to waste the time of someone as <em>important</em> as you.”</p><p>He ignored the jab.</p><p>“First of all my Master wishes you many congratulations for becoming the new owner of the territory and wishes you luck and good fortune in the future.”</p><p>“This territory is a responsibility for me, a memory of Lord Hihi’s hard work. I don’t understand how it is, where you come from, but I got this territory due to the death of an elder whom I respected. I appreciate the intention of your Master but such words might come off as rude. Please keep this in mind.”</p><p>Okita had to do a double take at the sudden change in the attitude of the girl. The girl had shed her mischievous personality and was sitting there as if a person of royal bearing all of a sudden.</p><p>“My apologies. As already started, we hope to continue the previous friendship and peace agreements from the time of Lord Hihi.”</p><p>“I will look into the agreements myself. Lord Hihi was an incredibly old person. Times have changed and as such if there are needs of any change in the agreement, I will have to take a look at them and consider. I do expect to maintain peace however.” she stated quite formally and he couldn’t find any fault in her statement. It was what any reasonable owner would do.</p><p>“We appreciate that. On the second topic, we were led to believe that you have the fortune to make an acquaintance of a new member of the Lucifer House.”</p><p>“It is indeed my fortune to meet with such a person.” she replied curtly.</p><p>He was not well versed in Senjutsu but he was quite proficient in reading someone’s body, something that came with his experience as a swordsmanship over the centuries. There was no movement… absolutely no movements at all that would give out any information. It was like talking to a statue who could somehow reply. Even as experienced as he was he felt a chill receiving such a reaction from what was a child of 13 or 14. How was she trained?</p><p>“We just wanted to clear the misunderstanding about us having any intentions towards the younger sister of the person and wished to convey this message to him personally.”</p><p>“That will not be necessary. <strong><em>My Master</em></strong> understands that and thus your colleague left unharmed. The girl with him certainly wasn’t aware of anything and it wasn’t hard to guess that she was merely being guided by the elderly servant who was there for the other girl. Our Young Miss however has taken the girl under her protection and has accepted the girl as a close friend. The girl herself doesn’t have any problems with it as you might have already been informed. If you are here for her, I will have to disappoint you. As for meeting my Master, he prefers not to be disturbed and I will follow his wishes. If you have any message, I will act as a messenger.”</p><p>“We have no intention of taking the said girl back. We were informed of her choice and we respect that. As for your Master, I was wondering how to address him.” he asked, wanting to at least take this bit of information back to report.</p><p>“My Master is ‘The Devil’. You can call him Lucifer. It is after all his name, not a title.”</p><p>Or not.</p><p>“Would that be all?”</p><p>“A message from my King, ‘We do not wish any harm or aggression towards the Lucifer House and if possible a friendship. If he is ever in need of anything, we would welcome him with open arms.’” he informed her of the message and bowed slightly to end the meeting.</p><p>She stared at him without any movements, her eyes almost seeming devoid of any emotion and then nodded slightly. “I will inform my master of this.”</p><p>He knew that not much could be said at this time. At least the main problem of clearing up the misunderstanding was done. He also got an important piece of information that the new Lucifer was very tight with Nurarihyon and apparently had a teenage sage Nekoshou as his servant. First humans, then a Half Fallen Angel and now a Youkai, this Lucifer was very different from any of his family members or any of the other Old Satan descendants for that matter.</p><p>Such opponents who do not narrow their scope due to their prejudices are very hard to anticipate or counter for that matter.</p><p>He got up and left with Magari following him.</p><p>“Souji.”</p><p>“Yes Magari-sama?” </p><p>“I don’t know and neither do I care about the matters between your Masters but… Kuroka and Shirone are my students. Do remember this bit.”</p><p>Ah… this was another problem.</p><p>“We have no intentions of harming any of them, Magari-sama.”</p><p>“I consider forcing them into any of your so-called peerages also a form of harm.”</p><p>…</p><p>“I will inform my King of this.” he said and bowed slightly before summoning a teleportation circle to return back to the underworld. This mission was exhausting.</p><p>______________________________x___________________________________________________________x_____________________________</p><p><strong>Beta Reader: LuluViBritania(FF.N, SB and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note :</strong></p><p><strong>This chapter was mostly reactions but I thought that it would be a fresh change for once.

    "content": "<p><strong>Disclaimer: I own nothing.</strong></p><p><strong>Chapter 14: Youkai, Ayakashi and Devils, Oh My!</strong></p><p><strong>- Damien –</strong></p><p>I walked into the amusement park while the group followed me. Vienna, Gretel and I were under my illusion which would hide our true appearances from everyone.</p><p>Kuroka was latched onto my arm while trying to press her budding breasts into my side, despite the heated glare from Vienna who was latching onto my other arm.</p><p>Gretel had a stoic face while she carried the basket of food along with Lavinia, Musashi and Sean. Merlin was carrying the most though.</p><p>It might have something to do with the fact that he tried teasing Gretel before coming here.</p><p>Shirone on the other hand was walking beside Gretel with our newest addition to the group, who looked as if she thought we were fattening her up only to eat her after it.</p><p>Asia Argento was delivered to us by Azazel after Odin had the meeting with Michael.</p><p>Safe to say that the church was adamantly against any compromises but that was only until Odin lost his patience and let out his aura.</p><p>This reminded everyone that the one who was sitting in front of them was a King of Gods, a being who led a pantheon and showed Heaven how truly and utterly fucked they would be if Odin made any moves.</p><p>Odin however was already pissed and raised the stakes.</p><p>Immediate execution of those who were directly involved with the Siegfried Project and excommunication of the outer members. Moreover he asked for every child with even a hint of his blood to be returned to the Norse.</p><p>Michael took command for once and negotiated the execution of the Director and Vice Director of the Project and anyone who conducted the experiments being excommunicated but to let the others go.</p><p>Odin did claim two swords from Heaven’s side which the church handed the now tainted Clarent which had lost most of its power and its demonic sister sword Florent.</p><p>Asia Argento was handed over with what Azazel called resistance that was mostly a formality.</p><p>Poor Girl didn’t even know what she was being used as and I seriously doubt she does even now.</p><p>She had almost looked like she would have a panic attack when she was introduced to us after we brought her back from Azazel.</p><p>I couldn’t blame her for it. She was only a ten year old and had been fed the stories of devils being the cause of all the misery in the world.</p><p>The Devil made me do it is surprisingly a very common excuse even in the world.</p><p>I just wished they removed ‘The’ when using that.</p><p>I don’t have enough free time to worry about those idiots.</p><p>The poor girl had almost retreated into herself from all the stress and fear.</p><p>It was only due to the efforts of Lavinia, Vienna and Kuroka repeatedly barging into her room and bringing her out to play or have some fun since then. Gretel had in her own way taken care of her and so had Tsubaki.</p><p>While she might not show it, Gretel was probably the most careful when dealing with her, apparently because the girl reminded her of her own self a little. So scared and looking at everyone as someone just waiting to hurt her. During our private talks one night after Vienna had gone to sleep, she had told me about it and I encouraged her to do what she thought was right. Since then, she took some time off to teach Asia about the world outside the church, cooking and even studies.</p><p>My little maid was really a kind person.</p><p>“This place is very good nyaa~” Shirone purred slightly, her eyes locked at the cotton candy stall on the side of the path making a few of us chuckle.</p><p>Shirone’s personality was completely different because of avoiding the harshness of the early world. She was like a child her age was supposed to be, cheerful and lively.</p><p>The park was in Kuroka’s new territory in Japan.</p><p>She had decided on this place as it was relatively safer for us.</p><p>“This place was owned by the Youkai?” I asked, looking around the place.</p><p>There were some Youkai in disguise around the place serving as vendors and mascots.</p><p>“Yes nyaa. The Ayakashi use the fear and the negative feelings from the Haunted Houses in the place. It also has a shrine for a Land God of this area connected to it so that the new years are celebrated in the park and also increases the visits to both the Land God preventing her from being forgotten and the income of the park. It is a cooperative relationship between the two sides which Lord Hihi before me had established. I verified the relationship with the Land God once I became the ruler of this area. She is very kind, like a little fairy and likes Mochi.”</p><p>“That is quite smart of them. But negative feelings? I thought Ayakashi only fed on fear?” Musashi asked.</p><p>“Fear is the main one. When Ayakashi attack people, most feel this emotion. Some might feel anger too. There are many who feel despair. The last one gives the most power and is extremely addictive to an Ayakashi which is the reason we were explicitly asked to avoid such things. I am a Youkai so it doesn’t concern me but I was asked to kill any Ayakashi indulging in such practices in my territory.”</p><p>“DUMMY, let’s go to the Roller Coaster.” Vienna dragged me by the hand.</p><p>I saw the sparkle in her eyes and didn’t resist either.</p><p>“Wait for me too nyaa~” Kuroka followed.</p><p>They looked towards Gretel and beckoned her to come with us as well but she said that she will find a spot for the picnic first.</p><p><strong>- Tsurara –</strong></p><p>“Rikuo-sama, see see a haunted house. Can we go there and scare people? It will be lots of fun. I bet we can get a lot of fear there.”</p><p>“This is Kuroka’s territory, Tsurara. Did you forget it? Moreover this Haunted House was established by Lord Hihi. There are already a few Ayakashis residing in this place. They own the haunted house.” Kurotabo held the super excited Yuki-onna back.</p><p>“Hmmp, I knew that but they could always share a little for a day. We just want to have some fun scaring the visitors, it's not like we are planning to take over this place.”</p><p>“Oh, look. Isn’t that Shirone?” Kejoro pointed towards the white haired nekoshou.</p><p>“Who are those people with her?” Tsurara asked spotting the other people with Shirone.</p><p>“Could those be the friends Kuroka was talking about?”</p><p>“Are one of those boys the Master, Kuroka was talking about?” asked Tsurara.</p><p>“Oh, that white haired one does look handsome.”</p><p>“But isn’t he a bit older?”</p><p>“Looks around sixteen years more or less so it’s not that old.”</p><p>“The other one walks like a warrior. His steps seem to be casual but are measured and alert. It’s almost ingrained in his bones.” Kurotabo measured the people in front of them.</p><p>“The one who is leading them is that girl. They seem to be deferring to her.”</p><p>“Could she be the leader of these people?”</p><p>“Maybe?”</p><p>“She isn’t a boy though so she isn’t the Master.” Tsurara instead, already playing a detective.</p><p>“We could always go and introduce ourselves and ask directly.” Rikuo spoke.</p><p>“Yes yes. Let’s go and show them that Rikuo-sama is the greatest.” Tsurara cheered.</p><p>The Rikuo currently however was the Human part and he didn’t like any kind of conflict.</p><p>“We are not going to fight anyone. Just introducing ourselves. Everyone behave”</p><p>“Yes Rikuo-sama.”</p><p>So she followed Rikuo-sama to those people.</p><p>Shirone smelled them right away and turned towards them.</p><p>“Those people are Devils. At least two of them.” Kuotabo spoke as he walked closer.</p><p>“That’s fine. Magari-sama told us that Kuroka was taken to her territory by the Devils. Apparently they had saved their lives after Fujimai-sama passed away.”</p><p>By that time they had gotten closer to the other group.</p><p>“Rikuo-samyaa~, Tsurara-chan, Kejoro-san, everyone, are you here to have a picnic too?'' The cute cat girl jumped in excitement.</p><p>“Are they your friends, Shirone?” the girl leading them asked.</p><p>“Yes yes. They are Rikuo-sama and everyone from the Nura Clan. We stayed at their place. Kejoro-sama makes very nice rice cakes and fish nyaa.”</p><p>“Ufufufufu I would have brought some food if I knew you were coming here too, Shirone-chan. We just came here to have some fun on our vacation.”</p><p>“I am Gretel. Nice to meet you all. I thank you all for taking care of Shirone.”</p><p>“No no, it’s a pleasure of ours. Shirone is always fun to have around.”</p><p>“Where is Kuroka? Is she not with you?” Tsurara asked Shirone.</p><p>“Onyee-chan went with Damien-samyaa to the roller coaster. Gretel-san, can they join us please?”</p><p>The girl called Gretel looked at their group.</p><p>“No, please we wouldn’t want to intrude.” Ah, Rikuro-sama is always so considerate.</p><p>“It will not be an intrusion. Please don’t worry about it. I apologize for our Master is not here but I am sure he wouldn’t mind.”</p><p>“Yes yes, he is a pretty chill dude. Feel free to join us. Fun times are always better with a beautiful company. By the way, are you single?” the white haired one came around and took Kejoro’s hand, kissing it slightly.</p><p>“Ufufufufu oh my, what a flatterer but I am sorry, I am already taken.” Kejoro replied with a giggle.</p><p>Huh?</p><p>Tsurara gaped as did all her other companions looking at the giggling Kejoro.</p><p>So Kubinashi finally got the guts to propose.</p><p>“Oh, what a pity. Your partner must be a very lucky man.”</p><p>“Wait wait, hold on. Kubinashi proposed? When? That sneaky bastard. He didn’t even tell any of us.”</p><p>The group congratulated Kejoro while following Shirone’s group to search for a place for the picnic.</p><p><strong>- Damien –</strong></p><p>I returned with Kuroka and Vienna hanging onto my sides like two koalas.</p><p>These two are really competitive.</p><p>Then again they are closer in age and still childish.</p><p>Musashi and Tsubaki are far more of the quieter type.</p><p>The scene I saw in front of me was surprising to say the least.</p><p>“They are from the Nura-clan nyaa. What are they doing here?” Kuroka revealed their identity as she asked.</p><p>“Your friends?” Vienna asked.</p><p>“The brown haired one is the third Supreme Commander of the Nura Clan, the grandson of Nurarihyon, Rikuo-sama. Magari-sensei introduced us to them.”</p><p>I had some thoughts in my mind.</p><p>Were they here to spy?</p><p>Let’s find out directly from the group.</p><p>“Rikuo-sama, Tsurara, everyone, did you come here to play too?” Kuroka asked the group cheerfully.</p><p>“Kuroka! Yes we came here to celebrate our victory over the Shikoku Youkai. It took three weeks to take care of the aftermath. We even tried to invite you but Magari-sama said that you were unavailable.” He looked at me and asked, “Is he?”</p><p>“This is my Master, Damien-sama nyaa. Damien-sama, this is Rikuo Nura, the third commander of the Nura Clan.”</p><p>I put my hand forward towards the guy who shook it quite nervously but with no hidden intentions.</p><p>“Nice to meet you.”</p><p>“Same here.” I agreed.</p><p>“Master, would you like to have something to eat?” Gretel asked me from the side.</p><p>She had made everything herself.</p><p>“Yes please.” I asked as she passed a plate to me while Lavinia distributed food to the rest as well.</p><p>We talked about various topics and I noticed that they tried to poke to find my identity but were unsuccessful.</p><p>I also got looks of suspicion from the blue-haired Yuki-Onna a few times but each time I looked at her questioningly, she turned and huffed cutely.</p><p>It was more cute than annoying so I left it as it is.</p><p>The good thing was that Vienna got to make some new friends.</p><p>When it was time to leave the group got up, I said a few words to Kurotabo who seemed to be the most mature one among the group.</p><p>I saw his eyes widen and muscles tense before he turned to me.</p><p>I didn’t say anything but left with my group.</p><p>Kuroka has called us to her new place while I still had to watch over Cleria’s experiment with the Ten Tails.</p><p><strong>- Scene Change –</strong></p><p>I looked at the massive tree in front of me.</p><p>This was an abandoned dimension created by some God and forgotten with many animals and plants. Such dimensions are generally connected to a main dimension like the Human world or the Underworld and are used for wars or experiments and such.</p><p>“I am sorry it took so long, Master.” Cleria came up to my side.</p><p>“No no, this is wonderful.” The tree was siphoning the energy from the place at a massive rate unlike what the Ten Tails had done in the Shinobi World under the direct orders of Annihilation Maker.</p><p>We had arrived at this place just a while ago and the God Tree was felt even from the corners of the dimension. I had to find a way to seal its presence from being felt by others if I wanted to use it in any way.</p><p>This dimension was as large as a small country.</p><p>I stood in front of the giant tree which was as if a borderline Satan Class beast was releasing its powers without restraint.</p><p>I was accompanied by Gretel, Merlin and Kuroka.</p><p>Everyone else was staying with Shirone at Kuroka’s place and enjoying a holiday.</p><p>“How long do you think it will take?” I asked as we neared the place. I had to shield Kuroka so that she could bear the pressure from the God Tree’s aura.</p><p>“Around an hour more, Master. I have been making it work for almost a day now.”</p><p>I looked around the area, with my Observation Haki I watched as the ground seemed to be losing its vitality somehow. It was like a bright coloured picture losing its colours.</p><p>“How does that feel to you Kuroka?” I asked the girl who had been staring at the tree with horror since we arrived at this place.</p><p>“It’s a monster nyaa. I feel like it will take away all the life. All of nature’s energy was taken away by it. Everything is devoured by it and when I try to use Senjutsu, all of that is being concentrated on whatever is on that tree, a small fruit of some kind. I cannot even look at the fruit but it’s as if it’s calling out to me. The tree is taking all the negativity inside it while using all the pure nature’s energy to create the fruit.”</p><p>“That’s about right.” Well except the calling part? I had asked Cleria to separate the negativity from the Nature’s energy and she chose this way.“What do you mean by calling out to you?”</p><p>“I don’t know but that much Nature’s energy is….intoxicating to feel.”</p><p>“Oh, is the energy irresistible?” I asked, looking at her slightly drooling on the corner of her mouth.</p><p>“Yes nyaa.”</p><p>We waited around the tree observing the changes for a whole hour until the surroundings were all drained of vitality and energy.</p><p>“So that’s the chakra fruit.” I looked at the small peach on one of the lower branches of the tree.</p><p>By this point Kuroka was visibly drooling. I’ll have to work on her mental defences more.</p><p>“The essence of a dimension collected into one small fruit yet I can sense no malice from it, maybe because all of that went to the beast itself.” Merlin inspected the fruit, casting a few spells around it and recording everything.</p><p>Helena hadn’t been able to arrive at the experiment because it was her Nephew’s birthday.</p><p>Now, she was totally the type of person that would forget herself in work but she never missed her family time when she did remember it.</p><p>The Dantalion House is really blessed like this.</p><p>She had asked Merlin to take over the research and collect all the data from the Ten Tails, God Tree Mode and the Chakra Fruit.</p><p>“So, is it all as we had predicted?” I asked watching Merlin step away from the fruit.</p><p>“Yes, I couldn’t find any fault from it. Can you?”</p><p>I touched the Chakra Fruit and my Essence of the Mad Doctor verified that it was extremely close to the real chakra fruit.</p><p>In fact it was much better than the original chakra fruit in terms of quality at least.</p><p>The Otsutsuki didn’t eat the Chakra Fruit directly but rather made pills out of it before consumption. Honestly this reminded me of those cultivation novels.</p><p>The Chakra Fruit did contain the vitality of the beings it devoured but also their last bits of emotions which more often than not was malice.</p><p>I mean it would take a special grade of masochist to feel pleasure and gratefulness from having their life sucked out.</p><p>This malice would cause a massive change in the personality of the user if the chakra fruit is eaten directly.</p><p>I kinda know why Kaguya went all emo all of a sudden now.</p><p>That’s what Merlin and I predicted before this project and Cleria made changes in her design of the Ten Tails to have it suck out the Malice and negative feelings to the Ten Tails itself.</p><p>Later it will condense another fruit containing all the negative emotions.</p><p>I will check if it works on the Ayakashi because they are literal creatures made up of negative emotions.</p><p>“Go on, eat it, Kuroka. I know you can’t wait anymore. Consider this a gift for your next tail in advance. Go.”</p><p>I looked over to Cleria who controlled the Ten Tails so that it didn’t react violently if the Fruit was taken.</p><p>Kuroka went ahead with dazed eyes and touched the fruit. The behemoth shook for a moment before Cleria used her Annihilation Maker to control it once more.</p><p>She plucked the fruit and took a bite from it and I erected a barrier in between us.</p><p>A massive wave of chakra or natural energy to be precise erupted from her.</p><p>She shouted, not in pain but in pleasure as it revolved around her in a whirlwind, increasing in speed with time.</p><p>Then it happened. She arched slightly as she was lifted from the ground, three tails popped out from her back right beside the previous two, making for a total of five tails.</p><p>Her energy rose sharply and stopped when she was stably in the mid Ultimate Class. That said, the qualitative change in her power was massive. Her power was far, far denser than before and natural energy almost danced around her, shaking at her every move.</p><p>Did the Chakra Fruit increase her affinity with Natural Energy?</p><p>The energy around her calmed down slightly and her body was lowered slowly to the ground. I caught her.</p><p>Looks like she fainted.</p><p>I also sensed a faint smell. I looked at her glazed look and then the source of the smell.</p><p>She had an orgasm.</p><p>….</p><p>A snap of my finger cleaned the girl before she could be embarrassed in front of others.</p><p>She was completely out of it to notice though so I brought her out to let her sleep for a while and rest.</p><p>“That was quite amazing. I’ll be honest, I knew that this could work theoretically but I had no high hopes for it. Good Job on that.” Merlin said as he cast a few spells on Kuroka. “Hmm, increased energy levels, energy density, physical strengthening, higher cellular vitality, increased regeneration, high sensory reception, I’ll have to check the extent of the increases along with the mental aspect later. There is also the increased control over Natural energy. The side effects of eating might be….pleasure filled euphoria. I’d take it any day. Congratulations, King. You just made something that would drive any and all Youkai to be your slaves for a bite. As for Kuroka, there are no other side effects from what I could say, not physically at least. We will have to check the mental part when she wakes up.”</p><p>I nodded at the report.</p><p>It was basically what we had calculated.</p><p><strong>- Scene Change –</strong></p><p>Kuroka was mentally fit too.</p><p>There were no changes in personality either.</p><p>The overconfidence that she might have gotten due to becoming an Ultimate Class was very soon beaten out of her when she fought against Gretel as a test of her new powers.</p><p>The sheer ease with which Gretel handled her would probably keep her reminded why Gretel Lucifuge is the second strongest person in our entire group.</p><p>That said, Kuroka has gotten stronger. She had a slight bit of control issue after getting so much power in one go but she will get used to it soon.</p><p>Her reflexes had increased drastically and so did her Observation Haki.</p><p>Further checks showed that her body was changing and becoming stronger as the natural energy purified her body. Her regeneration was becoming stronger.</p><p>Sages were so strong because they were completely one with Nature.</p><p>The Natural Energy purified their bodies over and over till it was at its peak level and in case of Youkai, the level where another tail can grow again.</p><p>After all the tests, Kuroka was asked to sleep and rest again.</p><p>It was then that I got a message from Shirone.</p><p><em>“Dummy-samyaa Dummy-samyaa there is trouble. There is trouble here. Vi-samyaa is fighting with someone nyaa. Hurry up and help.”</em></p><p>I stood up instantly on hearing her voice.</p><p>“Where are you?”</p><p><em>“I am at our place nyaa. Sean-samyaa sent me back with Mu-chan. He is with Vi-samyaa.”</em></p><p>“I am coming there in a moment.” I directly teleported to Kuroka’s territory from our laboratory.</p><p>Shirone was standing outside the house and the gathering Youkai there.</p><p>They all turned towards me and took battle positions until Shirone rushed towards me and hugged me.</p><p>“Where are they?”</p><p>“That way nyaa. Mu-chan went there after sending me here nyaa.” She pointed towards the general direction and I pushed my Observation Haki in the direction sensing the people.</p><p>There were around half a dozen high class people in the place apart from Vi, Musashi and Sean. Two devils with one at the Peak of High Class while the other at Mid Class and the others were all humans. The rest of the Humans were all weaker but still stronger than Mid Class.</p><p>“Stay here. I will take a look myself” I left a clone with her to protect her and rushed towards the place quickly.</p><p>It was a few kilometers away from where we were staying, towards forest covered areas around the edges of the town.</p><p><strong>- Vienna Lucifer –</strong></p><p>What the hell was up with these old coots?</p><p>Dummy was right. Old coots with mile long sticks up their asses were annoying to deal with.</p><p>She didn’t understand what that meant. She did understand why Gretel had glared at him for whispering those words though.</p><p>There was a no cussing rule at home and no one defied the Maid of the House on this one.</p><p>She erected another ice wall to stop the fire attack on herself while the other girl hid behind her.</p><p>She thought of how this started in the first place.</p><p>She and Shirone had been out for inspection of the area because Kuroka wasn’t here and she was very excited to be finally out in the open by herself.</p><p>It was during the walks that she found that there was an exorcist going around exorcising haunted houses. It was something about her being new to this area.</p><p>Shirone had wanted to impress her Onee-sama by investigating the exorcist and Vienna had taken it up just to kick some ass.</p><p>They had quickly started investigating like those awesome ninja manga that dummy had Alicia make. Being all super secretive and silent, she and Shirone found the location that the exorcist was hiding. Inside a shrine on the border of the forest, her observation haki had easily found the exorcist whose energy was a bit weird and both she and Shirone had decided to surround the exorcist from two ends so they separated and struck from the two ends of the shrine.</p><p>She drop kicked the door, sending it flying through the shrine while Shirone jumped through the window like an awesome ninja.</p><p>“Aha….your attacks end here, evil exorcist. No cutting down little Youkai and Ayakashi. We are here to stop you from hurting anyone else.”</p><p>“Yes nyaa….we are….ah….umm….whatever Vi-samnyaa said nyaa.”</p><p>It was after she had made her kickass entry that she noticed the exorcist. It was….a little girl with a patched up Shrine Maiden costume with her back against the wall. She had a paper talisman in her hand pointing at them although her hands were shivering with fear.</p><p>“Eh? Are you the exorcist nyaa? Onyee-sama told me that exorcists are scary looking people but you don’t look scary nyaa.”</p><p>While Shirone was speaking, Vienna looked over the room and saw the other parts of the room more clearly now that she had time.</p><p>The room was mostly empty and even broke but had recently been cleaned.</p><p>She saw the door crashed in the corner right over what looked like food on a piece of newspaper. Rice cakes. Only rice cakes and nothing else.</p><p>She looked around the room once more but couldn’t find anything else there. It was the only room in the shrine so she was pretty sure that the exorcist couldn’t hide the food anywhere else.</p><p>Suddenly she saw Shirone sniffing the air and then towards the exorcist.</p><p>“She smells like a Fallen Angel nyaa. Magari-sensei showed me how they smell.” She pointed towards the girl.</p><p>It was then that Vienna realised what was wrong with her energy.</p><p>This girl was a Fallen Angel but not a full one. She was a half-human, probably just like her.</p><p>“I AM NOT A FALLEN ANGEL!. I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM!.”</p><p>Shirone stepped down a bit in shock at the frightened girl’s sudden outburst and Vienna quickly stepped between them, hiding Shirone behind her.</p><p>It took Shirone a few moments to collect herself but she did and then pointed back to the girl shouting, “I AM NOT LYING NYAA!. YOU TOTALLY SMELL LIKE A FALLEN ANGEL!. DON’T TRY TO TRICK US NYAA!. I AM VERY SMART!.”</p><p>Vienna saw the look in the girl’s eyes and something pricked her heart. She knew that look. She couldn’t remember from where but looking at the tears collect at the corner of her eyes, she put a hand on Shirone’s shoulder. “Wait, Shirone. Let me ask her something first.”</p><p>Shirone stopped and looked at her but then stepped back.</p><p>“You….I don’t care if you are a fallen angel or an angel. Are you the one who has been exorcising and driving the Youkai and Ayakashi in this area from their homes?”</p><p>“Y-yes.”</p><p>“See, she is a bad person. She was chasing the ayakashi out of their homes.”</p><p>“Shh Shirone. Why?”</p><p>“I….I needed money. People hired me for exorcising their house of evil spirits. I did that and they paid me for the work.”</p><p>“Why are you here? Where are your parents? Family?”</p><p>She saw the girl shrink on the mention of her Parents and then hate at the mention of her family.</p><p>The feeling in her heart got worse.</p><p>“I have no family.” She said, her voice cold.</p><p>“I see. The Youkai and Ayakashi in this area are under the control of the Eastern Youkai faction of the Nura Clan. These Youkai and Ayakashi don’t hurt people, just sometimes pull some pranks on them and scare them to gain energy sometimes. The overseer of this place takes care of any rogues themselves.”</p><p>She saw the girl relaxing slightly and continued.</p><p>“I know your intentions were good so we will not do anything but you might actually seriously harm some innocent ayakashi this way. Please don’t do this. If you need to work for food, I will ask the overseer of this place to give you something. Your race will not matter. She does not discriminate against any races.” She saw the girl’s eyes widening a little so she continued, “I am a half devil myself. I understand how people can treat half -blooded supernatural beings like us but the Overseer of this place is a bit annoying but kind person. She will not hurt you.”</p><p>“Yes yes,my Onee-samya is very kind nyaa.” Shirone chimed in from the side listening to the mention of Kuroka in the speech.</p><p>She saw the girl putting her hands down and heaved a breath.</p><p>It was at this moment that the girl in question lit the talisman and a bright light flashed in the whole room.</p><p>It blinded both her and Shirone.</p><p>She quickly spread her Observation Haki and covered Shirone in reflex.</p><p>By the time she was able to open her eyes, the girl was gone from the shrine. She was already outside and running into the forest.</p><p>Shirone rubbed her eyes and regained her vision quickly too.</p><p>“T-that exorcist was bad nyaa. Onee-samya was right. Exorcists are bad people nyaa. Let’s go catch her Vi-samya.” Shirone said, flailing her hands.</p><p>Vienna had thoughts of her own and chased behind the girl as well.</p><p>It was then that she heard a blast in the girl’s direction.</p><p>Her Haki sensed around six people surrounding the girl. One of them was as strong as a High Class Devil, still a bit weaker than her.</p><p>She stopped for a moment and looked at Shirone as the girl stopped from the sound as well. “Shirone, go back to the main base and call Sean and Mu-chan. I will take a look and see what’s going on. That girl….she was scared. There are other people surrounding her. I will go first and help the girl.”</p><p>“B-but Vi-samya you can get hurt nyaa.”</p><p>“We don’t have time, Shirone. Hurry and bring me help. I am very strong. Quick.”</p><p>The little Nekoshou looked a little hesitant but ran after giving her a nod.</p><p><em>“Are you sure about this Vienna?”</em> Albion’s voice came from her back.</p><p>“That girl looked very scared, Albion. <a href=\"https://It….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">It….it</a> reminded me….” She stopped her words as she flew towards the area where the blast just came from.</p><p><em>“In that case, go. I will help you.”</em></p><p>Albion didn’t show himself anymore.</p><p>She flew over the area and stopped on the top of a tree looking at the area below.</p><p>A bald old man was standing in front of the girl who looked injured. One of the men was injured and being treated. “You should have died the same day your whore of a mother died by our hands.”</p><p>Vienna froze for a moment.</p><p>Flashes of barely forgotten memories came back to the forefront of her mind. Her fists clenched tightly as she tried to work her Occlumency to keep her calm but it was like stopping a raging ocean with a thin plastic sheet.</p><p>The old man held the girl by her hair and lifted her up. She cried. He sneered and brought his face close to her and spoke, “No. Something like you should never have been born. Your filthy existence is a sin against nature itself.”</p><p>The plastic sheet ripped and the raging torrent burst out like a tsunami.</p><p><em>“YOU GET YOUR FUCKING HANDS OFF OF HER!”</em></p><p>She felt a wave of energy burst out of her while the old man was stunned enough to let go of the girl and snapped his neck in her direction.</p><p>The men except the old one all fell down one by one but Vienna wasn’t paying attention to those as she dived towards the old man, her hands coated with Armament Haki.</p><p>The old man, while shocked, quickly regained his bearing and threw a talisman which was able to cover his escape.</p><p>The talisman burst out but this time Vienna had already shut her eyes and used her Observation to head forwards.</p><p>She sent a volley of ice spears towards the old man’s retreat path while covering the girl behind her back.</p><p>The man blocked the spears with another one of those talismans but one of them grazed his knee and he stumbled and fell behind.</p><p>Vienna took this moment to send another barrage of ice needles towards all the attackers.</p><p>Gretel had said to concentrate on the fight till the enemies were dead or incapable of doing anything. Merlin had taught her the same.</p><p>Vienna had learned to know that if <em>those</em> two agree on something, it’s probably true.</p><p>“Hurry, go towards the town. I will block them for now.”</p><p>Vienna said as she erected an ice wall around the people. She didn’t know who these people were but they seemed to be from this country. It could be troublesome for Kuroka if she killed them after attacking first.</p><p>The girl however was stunned and frozen in place.</p><p>Vienna couldn’t help but get a bit irritated, “Hurry up and run. What are you waiting for?”</p><p>The girl shook awake from the voice and looked at her. “Why?”</p><p>….</p><p>Vienna’s hands clenched as she recalled the moment when she had asked Dummy this same thing.</p><p>Did someone like her even deserve to live?</p><p>Was she a mistake that shouldn’t have been born?</p><p>Would her mama be alive if she wasn’t born?</p><p>Did they hate her for being born?</p><p>Dummy’s face and words that day would forever remain engraved in her heart.</p><p>“Because being born is not a sin.”</p><p><em>‘If your birth was a mistake, then mine would have been the sign of the apocalypse itself. Does that mean I shouldn’t have been born? Do you hate me for it Vi?’</em></p><p>The girl’s eyes widened as she registered the words and then her eyes were filled with tears.</p><p>She remembered that she had hugged Dummy and cried till she had fallen asleep.</p><p>She then looked in front of her as the people had regained consciousness and thrown several talismans around the area blocking the escape routes.</p><p>She raised several ice walls to surround the two of them and that’s why they were stuck in this situation.</p><p>She just hoped that Shirone would get back with help sooner.</p><p>“Colluding with the devils now? Just when I thought you couldn’t fall any lower.” The old man stood up, his shoulder and the side of his face injured from the needles.</p><p>Things got worse when two more people came in with strength equal to High Class Levels.</p><p>“Very well then, first I will burn this insolent cur in front of you….just like your mother and then drag you to face justice.”</p><p>The men attacked the ice wall as the old man started chanting a high level spell and sent a huge fireball towards the ice wall.</p><p>That would be dangerous. She couldn’t hold back anymore.</p><p>“Do it, Albion. I need your help now.”</p><p><strong><em>‘DIVIDE’</em></strong></p><p>The enormous fireball was reduced to half the size while Vienna felt herself fill up with energy. She pushed more demonic power into the ice wall and faced the blast head on.</p><p>“Those accursed wings. Such a horrible existence. She should be wiped out in the bud. All of you, attack with me.”</p><p>The old men got together to chant another spell while one of them rushed with his katana to strike the ice wall only to be stopped by a spear running through his head and right through the ground in front.</p><p>The atmosphere went still at the sudden death.</p><p>“There once was an old fool.”</p><p>“Doing things totally uncool.”</p><p>“He barked like a cur, with a matching temper.”</p><p>“I for once…. wanted to let loose.”</p><p>She saw the owner of the spear walk in and pull out the spear from the dead guy’s head.</p><p>The old man broke out of his shock and looked at Sean.</p><p>“Who are you? Name yourself before you die.” He growled.</p><p>Vienna chuckled in her mind.</p><p>Killing Sean?</p><p>Yeah….she couldn’t beat this beast of a guy even with Albion and he was just using a normal spear.</p><p>His skill at using the weapon and runes along with it were legendary.</p><p>He was also among those who had picked up the Haki teachings, the fastest only rivalled by Mu-chan.</p><p>“Me? First name Mario, last name Mario.” He spun his spear and shook off the blood on the blade of the spear. “Mario Mario.”[AN: Wink Wink]</p><p>He turned towards her and looked at the girl behind her.</p><p>“What kind of mess did you jump into this time Shorty? The Boss or even worse the Boss Lady would flay me alive if you got hurt. So, get out. I will cover you.”</p><p>Vienna stood up in front of the girl and stared back at Sean, “I will not leave her.”</p><p>He quietly looked at her and then the girl behind her and went silent for a few moments before sighing lightly. “I don’t get paid enough for this. Next time I will put the babysitting duty on Mu-chan.”</p><p>“Hah….who needs your help? I could beat them up all by myself.”</p><p>“Why are you even doing that? Who is this girl?”</p><p>“She’s….she’s….” suddenly Vienna turned back and remembered that she hadn’t asked for the girl’s name. “What was your name again?”</p><p>“YOU DON’T EVEN KNOW HER NAME!?” Sean shouted.</p><p>“Why would you need to know someone’s name to help them?” Vienna replied.</p><p>….</p><p>“Point.”</p><p>The girl slowly whispered, “Akeno. My name is Akeno Himejima.”</p><p>“Oh, nice name.”</p><p>They couldn’t talk for much longer as the men who had fainted had regained consciousness by now and raced towards them.</p><p>Sean flashed in between two of them and with a single strike, pierced the throat of one of the men and the heart of another. He then dodged the katana of a third and kicked him in the knees to make him lose his balance before striking his forehead with the butt of the spear, knocking him completely out cold.</p><p>Vienna shot a massive barrage of icicles towards the group who protected themselves again with those damn talismans.</p><p>One of them started chanting while another one held the barrier. The third started setting up more talismans to trap them all only for there to be a flash and the talismans surrounding the areas were sliced clean off.</p><p>Two more men fell to the ground, their throats slit as Mu-chan stood in between them, her hands holding two katanas.</p><p>“Are you hurt, Vi-chan?”</p><p>“Umm, I am fine Mu-chan. Let’s kick their asses. These bullies were attacking her.”</p><p>The old men also got more backup.</p><p>Two more people of High Class came and joined the group with several more mid class ones.</p><p>“This is getting more annoying. Did you call for backup?” Sean asked Mu-chan who nodded.</p><p>“Shirone is collecting a bunch of Youkai and Ayakashi and will be arriving here soon. I had no idea how many enemies or how strong the enemies would be before I arrived. At best we need to hold them back for a while.”</p><p>“Hmm, sounds good.”</p><p>“Well, cover the base. I’ll thin their numbers. I don’t know any defensive spells.”</p><p>“Sure, got ya.”</p><p>Mu-chan vanished in a burst of speed while Sean started writing runes in the air around the area they stood, making a protective shield.</p><p>“Shorty, hold them off for an attack.”</p><p>“Sure.”</p><p>The man who was chanting completed the spell while the one preparing the talisman attacked with it.</p><p>Mu-chan cut the talismans before they could do anything before flashing behind one of the stronger ones who had his throat cut open too.</p><p>“Haruma!” the old coot who was casting the spell shouted and released the spell towards them.</p><p><em>“Vienna be careful, those flames are of purifying nature. They will hurt you even if they cannot kill you.”</em> Albion warned quickly.</p><p>He fired a massive fireball in her direction.</p><p>Vienna put her full strength behind her Ice Wall.</p><p>The fireball took the shape of a bird and crashed into the wall.</p><p><strong><em>‘Divide.’</em></strong></p><p>It hurt.</p><p>The magic power flowed into her and she pushed it all into the ice wall.</p><p>The temperature of the place rose and she felt herself slowly losing her grip. Sean was busy setting the runes up and couldn’t be disturbed at all.</p><p>“DIE YOU FILTHY ABOMINATION. YOUR KIND SHOULD JUST DIE!.”</p><p>She was pushed back slightly.</p><p>Suddenly she felt a talisman knock on the fireball before being quickly burned.</p><p>The girl behind her was throwing talismans too.</p><p>She had her eyes red with tears but she kept using whatever she could to hold off the attack.</p><p>Vienna felt her anger erupt once more.</p><p>“SHUT YOUR TRAP, YOU OLD COOT!.”</p><p>The fire pushed back once more as the other old man joined in. Mu-chan was cutting people on their side up one after other while trying to block any going towards Sean.</p><p>Sean looked like he was going to drop the runes and come to her rescue but she signalled him not to.</p><p>And <a href=\"https://then….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">then….it</a> went completely white. She heard Albion’s voice in her ears and a smile rose on her face.</p><p><strong>“BALANCE BREAKER!.”</strong></p><p>A pillar of light erupted from her body.</p><p><em>‘</em><strong><em>Divide’ ‘Divide’ ‘Divide’ ‘Divide’ ‘Divide’</em></strong></p><p>The fireball shrunk to almost nothing.</p><p>The crowd gasped as Vienna rose from the wreckage, blue wings shining behind her white armoured body. Divine Dividing Scale Mail.</p><p>She felt herself fill up with magic instantly and waved her hands, completely freezing the feet of the attackers. Only the stronger ones had somehow dodged but even they were not unscathed as Mu-chan took the opportunity to cleave off the hand of one and slice the eye of another before retreating back.</p><p>Sean completed his barrier too.</p><p>The old coots seemed to have realised that they were at a disadvantage and backed away into a defensive position while glaring at her group.</p><p>“Well colour me impressed, Shorty. You really pulled through. I was prepared to dive in at any moment but you surprised me. Congratulations on getting Balance Breaker.”</p><p>“Congratulations Vi-chan.”</p><p><em>“Congratulations Vienna. I believe you have taken another step to mastering my power.”</em> Albion’s voice sounded too.</p><p>“Now how about we clean up some trash?” Sean said looking at the people who looked at us alertly.</p><p>They were about to start the fight when they felt two presences coming towards the area.</p><p>A strong one, almost as strong as Sean, while the other was much weaker, around the same level as Akeno.</p><p>Both the groups stood aside to see if they were a friend or a foe.</p><p>The wait ended when two figures arrived from between the trees. An old gentleman and a young girl with crimson hair and turquoise eyes.</p><p>The old man’s eyes widened when he looked at her, or more precisely, her armour and wings.</p><p>The girl on the other hand was looking at her with starry eyes.</p><p>“And who might you be? A friend of theirs?” Sean asked.</p><p>“Ah, where are my manners? My name is Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa, a peerage member of Lord Zeoticus Gremory and this is our young Lady, Miss Rias Gremory, heiress to the House of Gremory. We heard some explosions in the area and came to see what was happening. Could any of you fill us in?”</p><p>“Those old bastards were attacking Akeno over here so I beat them. They wanted to kill me so we fought. They were just too weak.”</p><p>“Vi-chan, language.”</p><p>“Ah….sorry.”</p><p>“So this fight is over, that young miss over there. Say, if you don’t mind, could I suggest a solution?” he looked at the old coots and said.</p><p>“Hngh what solution?”</p><p>“It seems that you do not want that girl? How about we offer to take her under the protection of Lord Gremory. She will never appear in front of you again.”</p><p>The old coots looked at each other and then back and nodded.</p><p>“As long as she doesn’t appear in front of us, we don’t care if she lives or dies. You can take her.”</p><p>And that’s when Vienna snapped, “Oye old fart. And please don’t remind me of language for now Mu-chan. This stupid prick thinks he can just walk in and sell Akeno over to whoever he likes, like her life was ever in his control. Well get a reality check dumbass, it’s not. Akeno here is with us now. She is under our protection and we ain’t need nobody to protect her.”</p><p>“So you people are friends. In that case, I can offer the same offer to you all. I assure you that you will be taken care of well. The Gremorys are very kind to their servants.”</p><p>Vienna looked at the dumbass blankly. “Not interested.”</p><p>“I’ll pass.” Sean answered.</p><p>“I have a master.” Mu-chan answered as well.</p><p>The little girl looked a little disappointed but didn’t say anything.</p><p>“What do you say Akeno? Do you want to join us?” she looked at the now confused girl.</p><p>“Please reconsider this Miss. I know you people are strong but someone of your strength and talent and being the host of the White Dragon Emperor on top of that will have many people coming after you. The House of Gremory can protect you from it. Miss Rias is the younger sister of Satan Lucifer. We can help you.”</p><p>….</p><p>Vienna looked at Sean who smirked and Mu-chan who shook her head with a wry smile on her face.</p><p>This idiot.</p><p>He was baiting her with the Lucifer name of all things.</p><p>“Hoh….that’s an interesting offer, I hear. However I’ll deny it in her place. My Vi is too cute to be anyone’s servant.” She heard a very familiar voice and turned back.</p><p>A smile lit her face as she saw the man approaching her.</p><p><strong>- Damien –</strong></p><p>To think it would be this scene. How did this happen in this place all of a sudden?</p><p>It wasn’t hard to guess the identities of the people even without the names just mentioned now.</p><p>And to think this guy would have the audacity to invite my Vi to be a servant….<em>servant</em>…. and that too with the Lucifer name.</p><p>For a moment, I wanted to rip his neck off but then I ignored it.</p><p>It was like watching a monkey dance around without realising its position.</p><p>The two girls were looking at me with dazed eyes and light blushes on their faces.</p><p>I was not under an illusion. My passive charm was working unfiltered. Vienna and others might have gotten used to it but these girls hadn’t.</p><p>Vienna had fought and shown her Sacred Gear. Her appearance was already recognized by everyone. If those bastards tried, it wouldn’t be hard to guess her identity and thus the fact that we were also somehow alive.</p><p>The only way to avoid that would be to kill every one of the outsiders here and silence them. That however would cause a massive shitstorm that was not worth the effort.</p><p>I let out a sigh mentally at the mess this situation was.</p><p>“DUMMY!” Vienna shouted and shot towards me.</p><p>She attained her Balance Breaker.</p><p>That’s something good that came out of this farce at least.</p><p>“Bossman.” Sean nodded towards me.</p><p>“Master.” Musashi bowed to me.</p><p>“So….what’s going on here? I was informed that Vienna was fighting with someone and that she was in danger? Would you care to elaborate?”</p><p>“DUMMY, LISTEN TO ME FIRST. Those old ba….I mean old guys were attacking Akeno-chan here. They even killed her mother because she was a half-fallen angel and said that she didn’t deserve to live, that she was a mistake, a sin. So I went ahead and beat them up but then they said the same thing about me and attacked. We fought and we were about to beat them up once more when these two came and were asking me to be a servant to listen to this….a servant to the little sister of Lucifer. Hahahaha that guy is so dumb.” She looked at me as if wanting praise.</p><p>I breathed in deeply before I flicked her forehead sharply. Her armour cracked before dispersing.</p><p>“I heard that you went to investigate the exorcist in the town alone.”</p><p>“I didn’t go alone. I had….” She became quiet when she remembered her doings.</p><p>“Yes yes. My apologies, you were not alone. You had a ten year old with you. Really Vienna. That was extremely reckless. You could have gotten hurt if they weren't keeping an eye on you….or worse….killed. Do you realise what that would have meant? What if you had encountered someone dangerous and way above your level? You were the elder one. You had to take care of her too. Do you understand what I am saying?”</p><p>She calmed down instantly and looked down, completely downcast. It hurt to just see her eyes like that.</p><p>“Then do you have anything to say?” I repeated.</p><p>“I’m sorry.” She whispered softly.</p><p>And that’s when someone interrupted me.</p><p>“Hey don’t be mean to her. She was trying to help the other girl. She’s a hero. She is awesome.” The crimson haired girl looked at me with a pout and her hands on her waist.</p><p>….</p><p>The scene was so out of place that everyone was stunned into silence once more.</p><p>“HEY DON’T INSULT DUMMY….” Vi almost burst out, furious.</p><p>I put a finger on her lips, shutting her up and looked at the surprised girl.</p><p>“I know.” I replied calmly.</p><p>“Huh?” The girl was taken aback.</p><p>“I know that she is awesome. She has been awesome since the day she was born and I know it more than anyone else in this world. She doesn’t need to prove it to anyone, let alone me. That’s why when I see her being reckless sometimes I feel I need to show her the error of her ways. I don’t want her to regret something later on. After all, she is my family. Thank you for standing up for Vi. You are a very kind girl, Princess.” I smiled at the girl.</p><p>The girl became quiet and blushed the colour of her hair.</p><p>I gently patted Vienna’s head.</p><p>It wouldn’t do to praise her first or she would take this kind of thing for a game. She needs to understand the consequences of her actions.</p><p>Now for the next part.</p><p>“Vi, you are very brave for saving the girl. I heard how you actually stopped and talked to her instead of just starting to fight at the very start. I am proud of you for doing what you thought was right. You were awesome Vi.” She lifted her head and hugged me.</p><p>She hugged me tightly for a moment before separating.</p><p>I turned towards the rest. “Now, would you tell me what you all are doing here?”</p><p>The Gremory servant spoke up. “We came here to investigate the fight.” His voice was much more restrained now. Perhaps because of Sean and Musashi calling me Boss and Master respectively.</p><p>I raised an eyebrow.</p><p>“This territory is under the Gremory.”</p><p>“Correction. This territory is under the Eastern Youkai Faction under Nurarihyon. The Gremory Territory ends 2 kilometres away from this place.” I narrowed my eyes.</p><p>I saw the eyes of the people from the Himejima clan and they were looking at him in hope.</p><p>Oh….now that’s interesting.</p><p>The girl on the other hand looked surprised by the reveal.</p><p>She genuinely didn’t know that this wasn’t Gremory territory.</p><p>“Ah, I must have missed that. We were on our way to meet the Youkai Chief of this area, Lord Hihi and introduce Miss Rias to him and show Miss Rias around the area. We were invited a week ago.”</p><p>The surprise in Rias’ eyes was enough to reveal the truth even if I didn’t already know this.</p><p>“Oh….that’s surprising.” I narrowed my eyes. “After all, Lord Hihi passed away <em>three weeks ago</em>. This area now has a new leader and I am pretty sure that she hasn’t invited anyone. How surprising?”</p><p>His eyes widened and he looked caught off guard but for a moment before he schooled his expressions quickly. “That’s….we had no idea. How did this happen?”</p><p>“This was three weeks ago in the attack from the Shikoku Youkai. This town was given to its new owner after that as a reward to look over. Let’s come to this discussion later. You seem to be quite….<em>misinformed</em> about the current events it seems.”</p><p>I turned towards the Himejima clan members, an older one to be precise. “Now, please correct me if I am wrong but you people invaded this territory, unannounced, uninvited, correct?”</p><p>“And who are you to ask anything of us.” One of the younger ones finally couldn’t resist and snapped at me.</p><p>BOOOOOOOM!</p><p>A blast of Conqueror’s Haki focused on him and he lost consciousness, foaming at the mouth.</p><p>Every one of them took a step back in surprise.</p><p>“Oh my, how uncouth. Do you not know that it is bad manners to interrupt people when they are talking? Be quiet.” I turned towards the frozen members. “So, where was I? Ah, yes. You came to this place, uninvited and unannounced and caused a fight here, am I correct?” I continued in an even tone.</p><p>“W-we were here to take the girl away. She belongs to the Himejima Clan.” He started blabbering, gaining confidence along the way.</p><p>“Oh is that so? And yet you attacked and tried to kill her.”</p><p>“It is a matter of the Himejima Clan. You don’t have a say in this outsider.”</p><p>“I do believe I had a say in it the moment you attacked my sister.”</p><p>“She attacked us first.”</p><p>“As was her right as one of the people protecting this place. You did invade like little thieves after all. And as for being a family goes on, I believe her mother is dead. She has nothing to do with your family now.” I turned towards Akeno. “Look at me Miss. Don’t worry. I know this might be slightly painful for you but can you tell me your father’s name?”</p><p>The Himejima idiots stiffened on that.</p><p>Akeno was both scared and angry when Vienna touched her shoulder and nodded to her.</p><p>She gritted her teeth and answered very softly, “Barakiel.”</p><p>“Ah that bearded buffoon.”</p><p>Jaws dropped on hearing my word but I continued.</p><p>“We if that’s the case, then even if distant, you and I are also family ….technically. Don’t worry Miss. Daddy issues are kinda my family theme. You’d be right at home.” I turned towards the Himejima Clan members, “You see I do have the right to interfere in this.”</p><p>“Y-you.”</p><p>They knew that they were being pushed into a corner. Right now any fight would lead to their deaths. The Gremorys won’t help. Too much is at stake already.</p><p>“But don’t worry, I’ll give you all a chance. My subordinates did kill a bunch of you. So let’s make a deal, shall we?”</p><p>The crowd looked at me.</p><p>Akeno looked a little scared and I heard Vi whisper to her. “Don’t worry. Dummy might be a dummy but my Dummy is the strongest Dummy there is. We’ll win.”</p><p>Controlling my lips from twitching, I looked towards the group and continued further, “I see that a dozen of your men died here, so I’ll give you a dozen attacks. I will not move from this place, I will not retaliate against you and I will not receive help from them. If you can make me move even one step from this place or well kill me, you win. You get to decide what to do with the child. You fail to do so and you will turn back and leave, never interfering with her life ever again, directly or indirectly under the punishment of eternal servitude to her. Are we clear, if so do we have a Deal?”</p><p>I saw them looking at me in disbelief.</p><p>“Why should I trust you? You could always go back on your word and use this as an excuse to attack us.” One of them called out to me.</p><p>“Oh, how suspicious. But don’t worry. I do not lie….that’s what humans do.”</p><p>“Hey!” Sean cried out.</p><p>“What, you don’t?” I raised an eyebrow.</p><p>“W-well we do but don’t say it out loud.”</p><p>“Whatever. Also, my word is my bond human. Or we can just leave our own merry ways? So what shall it be?”</p><p>“Deal.” As soon as he said the words, talismans shot towards me.</p><p>It wasn’t even able to get close to me before it was burned to ashes.</p><p>11 attacks left.</p><p>The three remaining ones took their stances and started chanting high level spells.</p><p>Vienna and Akeno stayed back and watched over me with worried eyes, one fearing for my health and the other probably her own.</p><p>Three gigantic fireballs with the power of High Class Devils shout out towards me but before they could even get close to me, they vanished.</p><p>8 attacks left.</p><p>I yawned.</p><p><strong>- Rias Gremory –</strong></p><p>Rias looked at the fireballs rushing towards the….cool and handsome looking boy and disappearing while he yawned.</p><p>She felt her blood rising to her cheeks as she saw him casually waving away attacks that could easily destroy her in a moment.</p><p>She was called here to see what was going on when Agrippa got the information about a fight going on here. She hadn’t expected the scene to be what it was.</p><p>A girl in white armour and awesome blue wings stood in the sky and two others were against some old guys who were definitely the villains.</p><p>The White Dragon Empress.</p><p>She was right as the girl was trying to protect another girl who looked scared and injured sitting on the ground.</p><p>She would say that she was a bit disappointed when the girl had rejected an offer to join their family but didn’t mind it. After all, they might have a family of their own.</p><p>She was a bit confused by the expressions on their faces when Agrippa talked about her brother though. Generally people were awed or even scared on hearing his name but they actually chuckled. It was mildly annoying but also intriguing.</p><p>People always flattered her for her family name and her brother’s title. She hardly had any good friends which was why she wanted them to accept the offer so that she could at least have a few friends to play with. Sona was her only friend and she couldn’t visit her often and Milicas was too young to even speak.</p><p>And that’s when he arrived.</p><p>White hair and those blue eyes. She could feel herself blushing at the boy’s face.</p><p>Her heartbeat rose and she almost missed the words of the girl.</p><p>That boy, Dummy? What kind of name was that? Was she mocking him? Ah, that was a nickname of sorts.</p><p>Then he scolded the girl and Rias felt anger. The girl was risking her life to save the other girl. She was so brave, a hero and he was scolding her so she couldn’t control herself and shouted loudly at him.</p><p>Imagine her surprise when the girl herself retaliated.</p><p>But he then explained himself.</p><p><em>‘She has been awesome since she was born, why does she need to prove that?’</em></p><p><em>‘Thank you for standing up for her Princess.’</em></p><p>Rias has been called Princess and Heiress many times before this but this was probably the first time it felt so real and….cool.</p><p>And then he made that deal.</p><p>Attack after attack fell towards him but disappeared before they could even reach him.</p><p>The old guys were extremely angry and then the oldest one of them all brought out a scroll.</p><p>“You called for this Devil. This scroll contains the full powered attack of The Divine Beast, Suzaku which can burn all evil. Give up or I will be forced to use it.”</p><p>Divine fire?</p><p>That’s very dangerous for Devils.</p><p>Mother had taught her that Divine attacks are the most dangerous for her kind, even surpassing holy attributes.</p><p>She looked at the boy worriedly but saw him smiling brightly at the comments.</p><p>\"Hoh no, I'll be fine I mean really....You're kind of weak.\"</p><p>The old man’s face turned ugly.</p><p>“YOUR FUNERAL THEN.”</p><p>She heard Agrippa step in front of her asking her to leave quickly as he started to summon a barrier circle before the spearman came in front of them.</p><p>“Let me help here.”</p><p>He laid out a barrier of runes in front of them. Agrippa didn’t comment but continued summoning his own barrier.</p><p>She felt goosebumps on her body and a severe chill ran down her spine as a massive bird of fire emerged from the scroll held by the four old men.</p><p>It screeched loudly and a wave passed around the area, scaring off anything that even came around the place.</p><p>She looked at the boy but saw him standing there completely unfazed.</p><p>The bird raced towards the boy. The trees in the surroundings burned away as it raced forward.</p><p>The heat was incredible.</p><p>It came quite close to the boy and then an incredible thing happened.</p><p>Everyone froze completely at the result of the attack.</p><p>….</p><p>He blew some air from his mouth and the bird disappeared.</p><p>Rias felt her mouth open in abject shock.</p><p><strong>- Damien Lucifer –</strong></p><p>Using a divine attribute against me and that too of the fire element?</p><p>What an idiot.</p><p>I looked at the gaping faces of disbelief as the Himejima clan members looked at me in abject horror.</p><p>“That level of attack….doesn’t work on me.”</p><p>Ah, Itachi….now I know how you felt.</p><p>I walked towards the old men who had fallen to the ground.</p><p>“Y-y-you….you are the Devil.”</p><p>My lips curled up into a smile as I brought my face close to theirs.</p><p><em>“Exactly.”</em></p><p>The old man just fainted.</p><p>I looked towards Sean. “Throw them out of the territory.”</p><p>“Yes Boss.”</p><p>I returned my gaze back towards Heinrich Agrippa and walked towards them.</p><p>He looked defensive but Sean was already beside him and he didn’t have any other option.</p><p>I ignored him and walked straight to Rias and took her hand, kissing her knuckles slightly. She blushed furiously but didn’t pull her hand away.</p><p>I took this opportunity to place a Binder’s Mark on her.</p><p>After today, the current Government will be aware of us. I need to place some security measures.</p><p>“You were very brave today Princess. Trying to stop the fight and giving me enough time to reach here. I thank you for that.” I gave her a smile.</p><p>She nodded her head twice, “I-it’s alright. I just wanted to help them.”</p><p>“And that’s why I said you are kind. It was nice meeting you Princess. I hope we can meet again under some better circumstances maybe?”</p><p>She nodded her head.</p><p>It was then that Vienna kicked me in the shin.</p><p>“You are incorrigible Dummy. Flirting with her as soon as you meet her.” She shouted with a pout.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“Is it because she has bigger boobs?”</p><p>“Eh?” The girl in question blushed even more and took a peek at my face.</p><p>“I know you always take peeks at Gretel. Don’t try to hide it from me!”</p><p>“What are you even talking about?” I asked surprised, not knowing the reason for her outburst.</p><p>“Don’t deny it. Last night when she was serving you food and the day before that when she was making my hair. I saw it.”</p><p>….</p><p>“And you are even going on a date with that thieving cat as a reward, and now her too. You are even calling her Princess. Where is my reward? I can use my Balance Breaker now. I want a reward too.”</p><p>Ah….so she was jealous of Kuroka.</p><p>“Oh….Yes. I do believe that you deserve a reward.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“So let’s decide when we return home.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Have I ever lied to you?”</p><p>She hugged me and I saw her giving a smug look at Rias who pouted only for her to mouth the words, “Dummy likes me the most.”</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>“I will take my leave, Princess. See you later again. Goodbye.”</p><p>I turned and walked towards the town.</p><p>“Wait….what’s your name?” Rias called from behind me.</p><p>I saw Agrippa paying attention too.</p><p>“I think those old men already introduced me.”</p><p>“Them? They only said ‘you are the Devil’. I am also a Devil? That doesn’t tell me anything.” She tilted her head.</p><p>“Ah, but that’s where you misunderstood Princess.” I gave a feral smile towards Agrippa as twelve wings opened behind my back. “You are a devil, while I am ‘The Devil’.”</p><p>Vienna also let out her six wings with a humph and we took to the air under the amazed eyes of Rias and the horrified eyes of Agrippa.</p><p>“Oh by the way, I only have one sister and this is her.” I pointed towards Vienna. “Do remember that the Lucifers didn’t fight in the civil war and while I might detest the old warmongers, if Sirzechs or anyone push towards my sister again, I can remedy the situation very easily.”</p><p>“T-that was not our intention.” He quickly stuttered understanding the implications of his earlier words.</p><p>“I know that and thus you are standing here. Do pass on the message.”</p><p>Vienna went and picked Akeno up while I nodded towards Sean and Musashi to follow.</p><p>The two devils went back towards their territory as well, the older one running away as soon as possible.</p><p>This was a huge mess.</p><p>I just left Vienna alone for a few hours to play with her friends.</p><p><strong>- Interlude –</strong></p><p><strong>- Sirzechs –</strong></p><p>He waited for his sweet little sister Rias and his father’s servant Agrippa to arrive.</p><p>Ria-tan was possibly about to get her first member for her peerage and maybe a good lifelong friend.</p><p>When he had found out that the Himejima were contacting the Devils to give them the whereabouts of a Half Fallen Angel child, Barakiel’s daughter to boot, he was taken aback for sure.</p><p>They had apparently killed her mother, a member of her clan for having a relation with the Fallen Angel Cadre.</p><p>He knew the amount of shitstorm that would cause if a Devil did something to her so he contacted Azazel personally.</p><p>He was informed that there might be some traitors in the Grigori who would want to harm the child because of her being half-human and with Barakiel always being busy as a cadre, her safety was not assured at Grigori. He then suggested that he could take the girl and have her become a part of his sister’s peerage and he would explain to Barakiel himself.</p><p>They had discussed the finer points and he had agreed to it.</p><p>It was advantageous for both sides after all.</p><p>Maybe one day this girl might act as a bridge between the two factions.</p><p>The thoughts were quickly interrupted when he sensed the arrival of his sister.</p><p>“Ria-tan!” He went ahead and hugged the adorable ball of joy.</p><p>“Onii-sama. You are home.”</p><p>“Yes, I got some free time so I came to meet my adorable Ria-tan. Father told me that you had an adventure? Will you tell me about it?”</p><p>She blushed. “A-ah yes. It was an adventure. It was totally awesome.”</p><p>“Heh! So what was it? Did you meet someone?”</p><p>Her blush deepened and Sirzechs felt a bit weird as he looked at Argippa who had a tense look on his face. Did something happen?</p><p>Where was the girl?</p><p>Agrippa looked at Rias and he nodded slightly.</p><p>“Let’s talk about it at dinner, Ria-tan. First take a bath and get cleaned up.”</p><p>“Umm.” She nodded and ran away towards her room.</p><p>Sirzechs quickly put a barrier as his father and mother along with Grayfia looked at Agrippa.</p><p>“Where is the girl, Agrippa? Did you not find her? Did those people back out on the deal?” he asked softly.</p><p>Agrippa had served the Gremory House for over four hundred years and his loyalty was no doubt unquestionable.</p><p>“This….Sir, some things came up. Really unexpected things.”</p><p>“Oh? Is the girl safe?”</p><p>“We couldn’t get her.”</p><p>“Was she?”</p><p><a href=\"https://“NO….no\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">“NO….no</a> the child was safe. It’s just that when we arrived there, the Himejima people were already fighting with someone who was protecting the girl.”</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>“I-it was the White Dragon Empress.”</p><p>Sirzechs straightened in his seat while the other three gasped.</p><p>“Please tell us everything in detail.”</p><p>He nodded and started recounting the events of the day, “The girl seemed to have met a half-devil girl who fought against the Himejima Clan members along with her friends to protect her. The White Dragon Empress seemed to be very protective of her.”</p><p>“Interesting. A half-devil is the White Dragon Empress? That’s good news for our faction. Was she from any house? I am pretty sure that someone would have bragged about it. Even if she was a half devil, the White Dragon Emperor is someone who can change the standing of any house.”</p><p>“I….I didn’t know about it. She was under her Balance Breaker and protested to the girl being traded off like common goods. The girl herself seemed to be close to her. Her friends were also strong and in the fight before we reached there, a dozen members of the Himejima clan were already killed by the two friends. I would say that they were all around as strong as me or maybe a bit stronger though they did seem very young.” He took a break, letting everyone process the information.</p><p>“Go on.”</p><p>“Yes Sir. I offered them all asylum in the Gremory House, I pardon for speaking out of line on behalf of the Gremory House but they all seemed very talented and of good character because of how much they were doing for a Half Fallen Angel who could be their enemy.”</p><p>His father waved it off, “Don’t worry about it. You did the right thing. If they were unaffiliated, it would be a great boon for the Gremory House to have one of the Heavenly Dragons associated with us.”</p><p>“Thank you Sir. She rejected however. I tried to explain to her that her life would be in danger if people found her and that we could help her. She could join Miss Rias’ who is the younger sister of Lord Sirzechs Lucifer’s peerage and will be protected and also provided with resources.”</p><p>He started sweating.</p><p>Sirzechs waved it off. This much was nothing.</p><p>“And that’s where I made a mistake, Sir.”</p><p>“Oh?” Grayfia raised her eyebrows slightly at this bit of information.</p><p>“Another boy of around 14 years of age came at that time and rejected the offer. I felt my spine chill at the mere sight of the boy. He did nothing but all my experience begged me to be respectful towards him. I even checked if he was using any kind of magic but he wasn’t. It <a href=\"https://was….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">was….it</a> was like watching Lord Sirzechs when serious. The friends of the White Dragon Empress also addressed him as Master.”</p><p>His eyes narrowed at the description but he didn’t interrupt the story of Agrippa who seemed to be in a horrified daze as if remembering the situation.</p><p>“Did he do something towards….” His father asked.</p><p>“No Sir. He was quite polite but I think he figured out the situation instantly. The Himejima people couldn’t guide the girl into the Gremory territory and were caught before that. We were in the Youkai territory so I had to make an excuse about visiting Lord Hihi, the overseer of the area.”</p><p>“Lord Hihi is a kind man. He wouldn’t mind such small things.” His father reassured.</p><p>“Lord Hihi passed away Sir.”</p><p>!!</p><p>“What!”</p><p>“Lord Hihi passed away in the attack of the Shikoku Youkai, three weeks ago. There is a new overseer in the area who was rewarded this territory.”</p><p>….</p><p>“I see.”</p><p>“I am sorry Sir.”</p><p>“Continue.”</p><p>“The boy didn’t call me out on my lie but dealt with the Himejima people. He managed to point out their fault of invading the area and thus justifying the attack of the White Dragon Empress whom he stated to be his younger sister. He also stated that the girl was ‘distantly related to him, technically’.”</p><p>An alarm bell rang in Sirzechs’ mind at this.</p><p>“He then offered the Himejima clan members a chance to attack him once for each of their members killed without any kind of retaliation. If they could make him move from his place, he would offer the girl back, if not, they will all leave and forget about the girl and will not interfere in her life directly or indirectly from then on.”</p><p>….</p><p>He took some water and drank while Sirzechs looked at the serious faces of all his family members.</p><p>“He….didn’t move a single step from the place. Even when attacked by four high class Exorcists, even when they threatened to use a scroll with the Vermillion Bird’s full powered attack, he merely smiled and said that he would be fine because….because they were weak.”</p><p>“The Vermillion Bird’s full powered attack is poisonous against Devils. It could vaporise even someone like me and grievously wound a Satan Class Devil. What happened?” His father asked urgently.</p><p>“He….he blew some air at it….and it dispersed.”</p><p>….</p><p>“What?” Sirzechs got up and asked as if he had misheard something.</p><p>“He blew some air at it and it dispersed.”</p><p>Sirzechs dropped all presences then and there.</p><p>“What was his name? How did he look? What did he say? Please don’t miss a single thing Agrippa. This is very serious.”</p><p>Agrippa seemed to understand it as well.</p><p>“He….he had silver white hair and blue eyes.”</p><p>The worry and anxiousness appeared in his eyes as he looked at Grayfia who seemed to have caught it too.</p><p>“The White Dragon Empress called him….Dummy the entire time so I couldn’t get his name. When Miss Rias….”</p><p>“What? What about Rias? Did he?”</p><p>“He didn’t do anything unkind to Miss Rias, Sir. He first scolded his sister but Miss Rias had protested that she was only trying to help the girl and that she was brave. He had kindly explained that he already knew that his sister was brave but he didn’t want her to regret any decision. He even thanked Miss Rias for standing up to him for his sister. When Miss Rias asked him name however and just because he was a devil didn’t give her his identity, he replied, ‘That’s where you misunderstand me, Princess. You are a devil while I am ‘The Devil’ and that he had only one sister and that was the White Dragon Empress girl.”</p><p>He heard the sharp breaths of his parents but continued to listen to Agrippa’s story.</p><p>“He might have misunderstood that I was there for his sister too so he….”</p><p>A pit grew in Sirzechs’ stomach. If the boy was who he said he was then a misunderstanding like that would be anything but simple. The Lucifer name still ran the underworld. Even in the Civil War, they had only won because the Lucifer House didn’t participate at all. Now if…. “What did he say, please say every word clearly.”</p><p>“Yes Sir. His exact words were, ‘Do remember that the Lucifers didn’t fight in the last war and while I might detest the old warmongers, if Sirzechs or anyone pushes towards my sister again, I can remedy the situation very easily.’ That he knew this was a misunderstanding is the only reason he was letting this go.”</p><p>“Sirzechs.”</p><p>“I know, father.” The Lucifer house had Rizevim.</p><p>Not much was known about Rizevim’s son let alone this new devil.</p><p>“Anything to prove his claims of being who he said he was?” Grayfia asked and then Sirzechs remembered that there was not any complete evidence that he was who he said he was. It might be someone else disguised and pretending to be a Lucifer to push the other Devils away from the White Dragon Empress.</p><p>A hope rose in Sirzechs’ heart but was crushed that quickly with Agrippa’s next words.</p><p>“He had twelve wings, Ma’am.”</p><p>He saw Grayfia’s slightly open mouth. His parents had the same expression.</p><p>Multiple Wings on devils is a sign of the Satan Houses and the number of wings told the strength of the Devil. Twelve wings meant Satan Class at minimum.</p><p>While Satan Class was still not a very big worry for Sirzechs, the fact that it was a 14 year old who had these twelve wings and was a Lucifer on top of that was a serious matter.</p><p>“What about his sister?” His father asked and he too raised his head to listen to the answer.</p><p>“Six wings, Sir. She seemed to be around a year younger than Miss Rias.”</p><p>A High Class Devil with a Longinus in a Balance Breaker. That would rival Ultimate Class Devils easily. This too at the age of eleven or twelve. Things just keep getting better.</p><p>“You said that he said something about detesting those warmongers?” His mother asked and he remembered this point too. “Elaborate on this.”</p><p>“He seemed to be against the people of the Old Satan Faction if what I could gather from this. I do not know the reason but I can hazard a guess that it was because of his sister. The Old Satan Faction is a blood purist group.”</p><p>“And to them a half devil would be considered a shame. There was already such drama with Merlin.” His father sighed heavily, reminiscing.</p><p>“What did he look like?” His mother asked and Agrippa created a magic circle, making a three dimensional hologram of the boy.</p><p>Sirzechs felt a shiver run down his spine after looking at the face of the boy.</p><p>Grayfia stumbled slightly and his father dropped his drink. His mother was stunned into shock as well.</p><p>Poor Agrippa didn’t even know what he was holding in his hands.</p><p>….</p><p>….</p><p>….</p><p>….</p><p>His father spoke after a minute of silence, catching his attention.</p><p>“Sirzechs, solve this misunderstanding as soon as possible. I don’t know about Rizevim but if this person wants to cause trouble, it would be far more disastrous. His face alone would make more than half the Houses side with him without a moment of hesitation. He seemed reasonable enough from what Agrippa describes. Talk to him yourself. Also don’t let anyone know of this. Especially not those old ones in the council. They would try to pull something and that would be….”</p><p>“I know, father. Agrippa, forget whatever happened today. Grayfia, contact Souji and ask him to assassinate the Himejima Clan members who were present there. Erase every possible evidence of this happening.”</p><p>Satan Class Devils cannot be eliminated without anyone knowing and a child, a Lucifer at that. Even if it was not his style, Sirzechs would never bring the thought about eliminating the boy. The harm that would cause would be far beyond what the underworld could bear.</p><p>The tensions between the Reincarnated Devils and the pure blooded devils, the tensions caused by the Great King faction, had divided the Underworld in many parts. Such an action would be like throwing a lit match in oil.</p><p>“Send Mathers and Souji to find out about the location of this boy. If possible, contact him and be respectful.”</p><p>“Yes my Lord.” Grayfia teleported soon after.</p><p>Just when he thought he could spend some time with his adorable sister and his son, things went to hell.</p><p>Then again perhaps that was normal considering he lived in hell….and ruled it.</p><p>_________________________________x__________________________________________________________________x_________________________________</p><p><strong>Beta Reader: LuluViBritania(FF.N, SB and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><strong>Phew, this one just kept getting longer and longer.</strong></p><p><strong>I wanted to write the interlude shorter but then I couldn’t help myself and went full out on it.</strong></p><p><strong>It was fun writing this chapter.</strong></p><p><strong>All that planning Damien did and Vienna threw everything under the bus in just a few hours.</strong></p><p><strong>He could have bound Agrippa maybe or made a deal with him but this matter was under the nose of two of the three factions and would have caused doubts.

    "content": "<p><strong>Disclaimer : I own nothing.</strong></p><p><strong>Chapter 13 : Meetings and Undercurrents.</strong></p><p><strong>- Damien –</strong></p><p>I was ready for Azazel to pick me up for the meeting with Odin.</p><p>Merlin decided to accompany me and somehow Sean was not leaving his best friend, Sigurd in that broken state for such an important meeting.</p><p>Sean was a bro.</p><p>Gretel followed us in case things went awry and we needed to escape.</p><p>So, finally the five of us were to go for the meeting with Odin.</p><p>A golden magic circle appeared in front of us as Azazel walked out of the light.</p><p>“So many? Well, your beloved maid can be your second, Sean can follow Sigurd and Merlin can be my second. In such meetings, it is impolite to bring more than one person with you.” He looked at me and explained at my apparent confusion. “First, it will be taken as a sign that you are weak and will automatically put you in a backward position in any further negotiation. Second, it might be interpreted as a sign of you trying to show your power and make the other party cower and we do not want that. Although this meeting is fundamentally different, it will do you better to keep these things in mind.” He looked at Merlin. “You didn’t explain this to him?”</p><p>Oh, he did.</p><p>It was extremely annoying to hear the explanations. I was never told about these in the Old Satan faction because they never expected me to make alliances so what was the need to know how to have such meetings.</p><p>Then again the explanations were understandable because bringing more people to such meetings could also be a plot to assassinate the leader and such things can put a strain on any possible peace talks. You don’t put a gun on the table before starting peace talks, right.</p><p>Merlin smiled. “Why do you think there are just enough people for us to make pairs? It might also be due to Sean not leaving Sigurd in case he did something stupid, a decision that I am actually supportive of.”</p><p>Sigurd had not taken his story well and was prepared to offer his head to Brynhildr as a compensation for what his past incarnation did to her.</p><p>It had taken a lot of convincing and support from our side to help him recover. Sean just didn’t want to risk him relapsing when he met Odin and possibly Brynhildr today.</p><p>“Ah, so that’s the case. Well, let’s go then. No need to keep this meeting on hold.”</p><p><strong>- Scene Change –</strong></p><p>The meeting place was chosen on a neutral ground.</p><p>We had decided that I should meet Odin first and then Odin will meet Michael and the Church representatives so that my presence does not make a mess of things. My face alone could have given Michael a heart attack.</p><p>Azazel had told me that Michael might look like a pretty boy with his girly looks but there was a reason, he was the current leader of the Angels.</p><p>Michael was far stronger than he let on.</p><p>Azazel had once said that Lucifer was almost twice as strong as him and Michael….he was at the same level.</p><p>While not a Super Class, he was still a Pseudo Super Class and with the trump cards of Heaven, he would without a doubt rival a Super Devil.</p><p>The God of the Bible was not a fool. If he could make Longinuses and throw them around as freebies to humans, he must have kept something in Heaven as a trump card too. Something at least rivaling a Longinus.</p><p>This was one of the major reasons why I had decided to keep my presence hidden right now.</p><p>The meeting place was a restaurant and we followed Azazel.</p><p>The people in the restaurant paid no attention to any of us which was extremely suspicious because anywhere I had gone before this had attracted a lot of eyes. Especially Merlin and me with our passive charms.</p><p>“They are under spells. The real workers of the place are on the second floor. These people are spelled to not notice supernatural beings. Follow me. Our meeting room is on the top floor.”</p><p>And follow we did.</p><p>I spread my Observation Haki and noticed that the staff consisted of Fallen Angels and magicians for the most part.</p><p>The higher floors were no different.</p><p>“What? You look surprised.” Azazel asked when he saw me observing the surroundings.</p><p>“I am. I fully expected this to be one of your Oppai Clubs to be honest.” I felt Gretel’s finger twitch lightly at this.</p><p>“Hahahaha I didn’t know you missed those. You are always welcome there, you know.”</p><p>“I’ll pass.”</p><p>We arrived to our destination and Azazel nodded to the man outside the door who opened and let us in.</p><p>Inside was a man with a long beard and a monocle and a serious look on his face and beside him sat a young woman with silver white hair down to her ankles and beautiful blue eyes.</p><p>I saw her eyes staring to me for a moment before I realized that she was not staring at me but rather behind me at Sigurd.</p><p>The man on the other hand was looking at me without blinking and I am sure of that.</p><p>I felt Sigurd still as he looked inside the room.</p><p>The woman stood up, her sight never leaving Sigurd and stepped forward.</p><p>Sean tensed slightly ready to put himself in between the two before Merlin placed a hand on his shoulder and shook his head.</p><p>“Sig….” there were tears in the eyes of the woman who I am almost sure by now must be Brynhildr herself.</p><p>She stepped forward taking the man in her arms, hugging him tight.</p><p>I kept my Observation Haki on full alert but nothing happened.</p><p>I guess whatever the prophesy was, was fulfilled the last time she killed him so itw as not acting again.</p><p>“Give the two some time alone. Let’s talk about what needs to be done by then.” Odin spoke for the first time.</p><p>I nodded towards my followers as well and they went out leaving Odin with Azazel, Merlin and me.</p><p>A period of silence settled over the place.</p><p>It was however broken very soon by Odin himself.</p><p>“When you said that you were bringing someone with a complicated identity, I didn’t think you would bring the Devil himself. You sure know how to surprise people even in their old age, Azazel.”</p><p>“Hahahaha he looks like him, doesn’t he? Even I was a bit taken aback when I had first seen him. You can guess why I didn’t want to reveal his identity. It would have caused too much chaos at such a delicate time.”</p><p>Odin’s stare had still not left me. “Good to see that you have made up with your brother, even if it is his reincarnation.”</p><p>….</p><p>….</p><p>….</p><p>….</p><p>My soul almost popped out of my mouth due to his claim.</p><p>He could see souls.</p><p>Dammit.</p><p>Can he see that I am a reincarnator?</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Before I could ask anything else, he continued.</p><p>“Do you think this eye of mine is for a show, child? Your soul is hauntingly similar to his brother’s. Not completely, which is a bit off in itself, but still too much for it to be a coincidence?”</p><p>The fuck was this man talking about?</p><p>I looked genuinely confused this time.</p><p>Azazel was now looking at me, thinking about something.</p><p>“It might have something to do with the fact that he was created from Lucifer’s blood. A clone of sorts.” Merlin put out a thought. I could see the intrigue in his eyes dancing.</p><p>Odin shook his head, “That might have something to do with it but body and soul are two different things. His soul is older than his body. A reincarnation if I have ever known any. He might not remember it but he <em>is</em> a reincarnation. Infact everyone except the girl that came with him were all reincarnated.”</p><p>….</p><p>Azazel quieted down for a while and thousands of thoughts ran through my mind before he spoke. “So you are telling me that Damien here, is the reincarnation of Lucifer?” his voice was extremely neutral.</p><p><a href=\"https://“Hmm….no\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">“Hmm….no</a>.”</p><p>Azazel looked up and he continued, “I am saying that he is a reincarnation of your brother.”</p><p>I saw Azazel’s eyes widen for a moment before he hurriedly asked, “Are you sure?”</p><p>“I have met your brother before and I know a soul when I see it. After he changed, his soul changed too. It looked tainted….chaotic.” He paused for a moment thinking of better words maybe. “While this child also has that taint, he is much more controlled. Much more….balanced. Yes balanced. That’s the word I am looking for.”</p><p>Azazel’s gaze towards me became a bit complicated.</p><p>I decided to break the subject before something else came out. I was having hard time controlling myself as it is.</p><p>“Will my being the probable reincarnation of the Devil be a problem for this meeting?” I asked in a neutral tone. In my mind, I had already thought of several things.</p><p>He waved a hand, “Nah, that’s a problem for the three factions. I was just surprised as is. For me, you are the savior of my blood and probably also my daughter’s life. That alone puts you above most people in the three factions.”</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>His words were true.</p><p>I had to find a way to hide my soul now.</p><p>I don’t know what that bastard had done to my soul but I couldn’t use my essences to heal it so easily. I had tried trading my soul’s damage to others but that didn’t work.</p><p>“Now, could you tell us about the situation once more? How did you find Sigurd? What is this….Project Siegfried?”</p><p>“Hmm….I had gotten some information from some of my sources among the Church that they were creating enhanced exorcists. These exorcists had the DNA of Siegfried implanted into them and many of them went crazy or died before they could even reach their teenage years. I had lent this information to Damien here, to repay him for a favour. He infiltrated the research facility and found some documents and on searching further, he found out just who they were extracting this DNA from. He took Sigurd out along with all the documents when he realized what he had stumbled upon and contacted me and that’s….well that’s why we are here now.”</p><p>Odin looked at me and bowed slightly in gratitude and I bowed back</p><p>“So, you understand this as much as I do that people have been very displeased with how the Devils have been recruiting from several factions. Surtur, the second being in the peerage of the current Lucifer.” He paused at the Lucifer word and looked at me for a moment looking unsure. I shook my head and asked him to continue. “had already raised many voices but I had calmed them down due to the fact that Surtur had left on his own. That case although a major one was by no means an isolated one though. There have been many such cases, big or small where people were recruited in the peerages of the Devils, sometimes even through less than fair means and this has caused a lot of strain on our relationship with the Three Factions. The warmongers among my people were furious when they had heard that the Church had captured the swords of our faction but I used my authority to suppress those. The swords they had collected were all bad memories for many of us….BUT….<em>this</em>….this is not something I can control.”</p><p>“Perhaps we could ask Heaven to pay some form of compensation. Sigurd himself doesn’t want a war. His words would hold some value too.”</p><p>“Sigurd has been raised by the people of the Church. His words will be considered based and thus might not hold such value. Compensation will need to be paid. It has been decided that they will have to hand over all the children with Sigurd’s blood over to us for they carry the power of the Norse. They will return all the weapons belonging to the Norse back to us as well as a legendary Holy and a legendary Demonic sword as compensation. This is already the least I could ask about. Some of my people wanted Heaven to hand over a Longinus wielder as compensation or start a war.”</p><p>“….that might have been a bit too much and would have given the Church people a reason to push more. Those people are more fanatical than they are useful.” Merlin said awkwardly. “I remember having scuffles with them. Just because I invented magic and I had a Satan’s blood, a Satan who had disowned me mind you, they had declared all the forms of magic taught by me as heretical. Like seriously, there has got to be a limit of pettiness.”</p><p>“Do you think they will agree?” I asked Azazel.</p><p>“I….I have talked to Michael personally. He was quite agreeable towards the idea. The Church had acted by itself and while I will not say that Heavens were completely unaware of such things, they were still in the unknown about the true extent of things. They are probably the side who are restricted the most in increasing their strength. They have to rely on the Church to a great extent to ensure their survival and the Church takes advantage of such. They are will to agree to any reasonable demands to prevent this war because no matter what happens, Heaven will be the ones losing the most.”</p><p>Which is quite understandable as in the event that there is a war and the other two Biblical Factions join them and support the Heavens, they will have to make <em>severe</em> concessions to them? These concessions will surely surpass whatever Odin was demanding.</p><p>“So, what is it that you need from Heaven?” Odin asked, looking at me.</p><p>“Me? If possible I would need a particular person. A nun by the name of Asia Argento who has a Sacred Gear called Twilight Healing which is capable of healing even Devils. She is currently a Holy Maiden in Italy. I wish to recruit her.”</p><p>“A healer who can heal devils. Healing Type artifacts and medicines are very rare, especially ones that can heal even Devils. I can understand your choice but….is that it?” Odin asked a little surprised.</p><p>“From Heaven and the Church, yes. From you….”</p><p>“Oh.” He narrowed his eyes.</p><p>“I wish for an alliance with the Norse Faction.”</p><p>He raised an eyebrow at the unexpected request so I explained further.</p><p>“My identity is as you had already guessed….quite complicated.”</p><p>“Heh….that’s putting it very mildly.”</p><p>“Exactly and I have no intention to join the Old Satan Faction or their delusions of conquering the world.”</p><p>“They are still after that?” He asked incredulously.</p><p>“Perhaps stubbornness is the only thing they have inherited from their ancestors. I have no intention of becoming a part of that foolishness. Nor do I have any intention of becoming a political boy toy of the Current Government. Even with my level of patience, I am not sure I could resist doing something….unpleasant to those old devils if they plotted against me, which let’s be fair here is a forgone case by now.”</p><p>Both Odin and Azazel smiled slightly at that.</p><p>“This only leaves me with the option of making a place of my own and I want your help with this.”</p><p>He looked at me incredulously. “So let me get this straight, you, the possible reincarnation of The Devil, the second most famous figure of the Abrahamic Factions is asking me to help you with creating a faction that might as well become a fourth power. Do I look that much of a fool to you?”</p><p> “An honourable man was what I preferred but incase,” and here I smiled, “The Great All-Father Odin, the King of the Norse Gods will stoop so low as to deny the savior of his child’s life….then sure.”</p><p>“Is that it? Trying to provoke my pride?” he asked blandly.</p><p>“Not really. I can promise you that the Norse will have my eternal friendship as long as they do not betray me and mine first. I will also provide you with some products that only I can make which will include an alternate to Phenex Tears.” I saw Azazel snap his head in my direction but I continued. I had expected this to be a negotiation that I will have to fight on a back-foot but that was the reason Ophelia, Merlin and I had spent the last week sleeplessly thinking of anything that I could offer to have this alliance. The Norse name is big enough to make the coming journey extremely smooth. “For a price of course. There will be other products too which will be added later on that said you will get a priority for these products as well.”</p><p>Odin looked a little thoughtful.</p><p>Phenex Tears is a rare good after all.</p><p>A single member of Phenex family with their Clan Trait needs around five hours of perfect concentration to make a single phoenix tear. Even a slight interruption or loss of concentration can cause the process to fail.</p><p>This is the reason why Phenex Tears are so rare and cost a hundred millions per dozen and that’s for the Devils. Other factions have to buy them through other channels which cost them several times more.</p><p>I and Helena have been working our asses off to make a substitute for one since we started our work. It is always an immensely persuasive negotiation tool.</p><p>“So you want a trade agreement between your people and mine. That’s fine. But for me to recognize your people as a legitimate faction, you will need numbers. Some factions can have a leader class at best but they are still recognized as a legitimate faction because they have numbers. A handful of people, no matter how strong can only make a group of terrorists. Do you have any plans for that?”</p><p>“I do. I will get the numbers by the time I reveal myself.”</p><p>Azazel joined here and supported me, “It’s not as if there haven’t been such cases before. Merlin here did so. Mephisto Pheles has also created a Magician’s Organization known as Grauzaubeurer, although he has maintained a connection with the Current Government, making an independent faction is not without a precedent.”</p><p>“It will take some time but I am sure I can make one. I just want a place for my loved ones to stay away from politics and live peacefully.”</p><p>“We all wish and hope for peace but something as luxurious as peace needs to be earned and believe <a href=\"https://me….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">me….it</a> is very hard.” Odin spoke with a solemn voice. “Anyways, you did save the life of my child. Prepare your people, when you are ready, we will have an alliance. You have my word as Odin, All-Father and the King of the Norse. We can begin our trade then.”</p><p> We discussed the deal in detail. My subordinates and I had spent several sleepless nights thinking about these deals.</p><p>It was finally decided that we will commence our trade in two years when I have a proper production line for my products.</p><p>I only needed one but I hope to push my subordinates and I to a respectable level of strength by the end of two years.</p><p>Odin will be having a meeting with Michael and the Church representatives with Azazel as a mediator soon.</p><p>My presence will be kept a secret from the entire Norse until I am ready.</p><p>Brynhildr thanked me several times and promised to repay me in the future if I ever needed her help.</p><p>I think I have an idea on what I needed from the Norse.</p><p>A certain Valkyrie who is still in training now.</p><p><strong>- Scene Change –</strong></p><p>“So, I take it that you succeeded.” Ophelia asked as I slumped into the couch.</p><p>The talk with Odin had been incredibly risky.</p><p>As Azazel had said, I wanted to wait till I was strong enough but even at the Peak of Satan Class with a Longinus on top of that, I still felt a bit lacking when facing Odin.</p><p>Not to mention that Thor is said to be stronger and one of the top ten strongest beings in the world.</p><p>“I still don’t understand why you went for it to be honest. The current government could easily offer them the same deal with the Phenex Tears and could provide them with a much more profitable deal than we could. They might even turn against us and help those people to kill us.” Vienna complained.</p><p>“That won’t be so easy.” Ophelia explained. “First, there is no civil war right now. If it is found out that they targeted the descendants of the Original Satan, without provocation, especially one who is descended from two Satans like Damien here, there would be riots everywhere. The Old Satan faction will take advantage of this. Our moles in the faction have made sure of it. Second, it is precisely because we are the weaker party that Odin will be more agreeable to sign the contract with us. With the current government, they would have faced a party who would have been more or less at the same level as them, so they wouldn’t have had the upper hand in the negotiation. They would have never agreed to attack Damien because Odin is not a fool. What’s to guarantee that they would keep their end of the deal after Damien is killed? They might as well claim that the Norse hurt the descendant of an Original Satan and turn on them asking for compensation. Damien on the other hand, in their minds doesn’t have enough power to go against them and won’t do so unless pushed into a corner so is a more agreeable partner. Obviously this would have been extremely different if they had any idea just how many Longinuses we have on our side or the means of our people. If that was known, not only the Norse, every faction out there would try to kill us as quickly as possible. We currently own almost half of the Longinuses and similarly strong Sacred Gears. This is enough to make any faction cautious about us. We just have to make sure that we can keep our side of the deal till we are strong enough to defend ourselves.”</p><p>“Will the Norse really back us up?” Vienna asked again. She had been coached by Gretel and Ophelia about politics no matter how much she disliked it.</p><p>“They will. They backed the Fallen during the Great War. That was one of the main reasons Azazel could quit the war so easily without any of the other two sides chasing the Fallen to kill. There are no eternal alliances, Vienna, only eternal profits. As long as the Norse profit from us they will back us up. We need a decade at most to surpass them all so by the time they realize it, it will already be too late. My deals are not so easy to break.”</p><p>I did make a ‘Deal’ with Odin. Something he doesn’t even realize at this time.</p><p>“So we just have to become strong, right?” Vienna asked, pouting.</p><p>I smiled as I picked her up before bringing her in my lap. The little gremlin now acted as if she was a grown up, all tsundere towards me.</p><p>“Yes, so train hard, alright so that you can save me from bad people.” I caressed her head despite her protests until she gave up her resistance and melted into my arms. “Ophelia, please look into the matter of the Damphirs in the Tepes faction faster. I will need their assistance sooner than I had expected.”</p><p>“Did something happen, my Lord?”</p><p>I thought for a moment as I recalled the talks from earlier.</p><p>My soul looked like Lucifer’s….well almost like Lucifer’s.</p><p>Was it because of the Essences?</p><p>I remember that my Essences had reacted violently when I had first taken them and that bastard had done something to my soul to fix it.</p><p>Did he make it so that he could watch me suffer and have fun?</p><p>Was it because I was being injected with the blood of the Original Satans?</p><p>Or was it because I was created from the blood of two of the Four Satans.</p><p>There are a few types of magic that change souls too.</p><p>“I….Odin looked at me with his enchanted eye and he said….”</p><p>Everyone looked at me while I tried to find the correct words to explain it. “He said I might be the reincarnation of Lucifer.”</p><p>I could literally hear the heartbeats of the people in the room as everyone’s breath got stuck momentarily.</p><p>“What?” Ophelia asked wide-eyed.</p><p>His reason was that my soul was older than it looked, which was obvious. I was a reincarnation after all. But what the hell did it mean by me being a reincarnation of Lucifer?</p><p>“He said my soul looked almost like Lucifer’s. Not completely but hauntingly similar to his.”</p><p>“But….but that’s impossible. We devils, we cease to exist after we die. There is no afterlife for us. There is nothing for us after we die. How does one even reincarnate from oblivion?”</p><p> “I don’t know the reasons but it might have been because I was created from Lucifer’s blood. He did say that it was not <em>completely</em> alike. His actual words were that my soul was more similar to Lucifer’s before his rebellion. It was tainted, sure, but unlike Lucifer’s, my soul was more balanced. Helena, please help me devise a spell to hide my soul.”</p><p>“That….I don’t think there are many things that could hide from the enchanted eye of Odin. We can try though.”</p><p>What can I use to hide my soul?</p><p>I mean I don’t even know what a soul looks like. What was my soul supposed to look like? What does a normal Devil’s soul look like?</p><p>I didn’t even think that there was a reason to hide my soul.</p><p>Razevan’s example had made it clear that the best disguise is the one that’s just out in the open.</p><p>What should I do?</p><p>If I started hiding my soul by simply making it disappear, it might bring more suspicion from those who can observe souls.</p><p>I mean it’s not like anyone can attack me or anything just by looking at my soul.</p><p>It is quite similar to what my Observation Haki does to others in a way.</p><p>So what should I do?</p><p>I thought about it and the answer led me back to my very first project which was almost on the verge of completion now.</p><p>….</p><p>Illusions.</p><p>I am almost there.</p><p>I can feel it already.</p><p>The last part which was related to the conversion of energy had come from a very unexpected source.</p><p>Albion’s Divide.</p><p>Divide is separated into two parts, first, halving the power of the one they touch and second, absorbing the halved power.</p><p>Albion’s Divide can change any type of energy to the one he uses when he divides other’s.</p><p>I just reversed the process and by the end of it, I could change my energy to any other type of energy.</p><p>Now lay the part of hiding it with a lie using the ‘Prince of Lies’ and I was able to create an illusion that could help me contend with Super Class beings easily.</p><p>“Try to find the Damphirs quickly, Ophelia. In the meantime, please bring me any information you can get about souls and soul magic.”</p><p>“I think I might know where you can find such information, my Lord.” Helena said. “Ajuka Beelzebub’s research. The Evil Pieces work on the souls as well. It is the reason why Gods and Buddhas cannot be changed by the Evil Pieces because their Divine Souls protect them. I had tried to do some research on them but was forbidden as I was not a part of his research team. Evil Pieces are very closely related with the current devil society and no one is allowed to do independent research on them. It was both understandable and frustrating.” She pouted.</p><p>It was quite hilarious to adorable watch the usually calm and composed lady like her pout like a child when she was denied research in a particular field. It was almost like taking a toy from a child. I was getting to see various sides of my bound subordinates.</p><p>“That’s quite easy, you know. You could just hunt a Stray Devil and isolate their Evil Piece inside your Innovate Clear’s world and research it as much as you want. Moreover I will need your help for training. I want you to try to use your Innovate Clear to try and create a small world where time flows faster than outside.”</p><p>I saw the look of realization on her face. “Of course. A time chamber. If we don’t have time, we can just make some for ourselves. Why didn’t I think of it? This will solve so many of our problems. Obviously there is the fact that we will still age normally but that’s a matter we can handle easily with our long lifespans. I wonder….”</p><p>And she went on with her thoughts.</p><p>I don’t think many of the people in the underworld would have seen this side of the most famous female scholar among the devil race.</p><p>The time chamber idea that I had come up with recently after I was watching the shit show that was Drag-so-Ball.</p><p>Even if she was able to increase the flow of time inside the Innovate Clear by twice and maybe increase gravity or such, it could become the most advanced training room possible.</p><p>It was a Hyperbolic Time Chamber + Gravity Training Room + Danger Room all combined into one artifact.</p><p>“Try to arrange for the books on Soul Magic of any pantheon or faction.” With that said I returned back to our original topic of the deal with the Norse.</p><p><strong>- Scene Change –</strong></p><p>I looked at my Shadow Clone who was currently under the illusion.</p><p>I had them use every detection method I could use to try and break from the illusion.</p><p>Observation Haki could easily be fooled if the signals received by the brain itself were changed. That said, the instinct of the clones was still intact.</p><p>I had reached the level of Future Sight although it was only a fraction of a second.</p><p>If the clones realized they were going to be destroyed by staying in a place, they moved. They could also retrace the attack and retaliate in the said direction.</p><p>This also meant that anyone with clairvoyance could retaliate even when trapped in this illusion.</p><p>That said from the feedback I got from the destroyed clones, they didn’t sense anything amiss before that. They couldn’t break the illusion either.</p><p>It is complete.</p><p>Finally,</p><p>And it will only become stronger the more I become proficient in ‘The Prince of Lies’ trait.</p><p>Years of work and I finally have created my first original skill.</p><p>There was happiness but fatigue overcame that at the moment.</p><p>I slumped on the ground of the training ground.</p><p>It had been two weeks since I had the meeting with Odin.</p><p>I had devoted the entire time, all of the clones and every bit of energy I had to improve my illusion spell</p><p>“Dummy, Kuroka is here.” I heard Vienna’s voice calling out to me.</p><p>And sure enough, a pair of cat girls was walking my way with Vienna by their side. In the last few years I noticed that Shirone was growing up just like Kuroka and was not having her growth stunted by her trauma.</p><p>The mark and proper Senjutsu training helped too.</p><p>“Damien-sama, I’m back. Did you miss me?” The older of the two cat girls jumped at me. Kuroka has always been more into physical shows of emotions.</p><p>She was almost my age and at thirteen, she was starting to develop into quite a beautiful girl.</p><p>“I did.” I caressed her ears as she purred.</p><p>Vienna pouted and Shirone fidgeted when looking at her sister.</p><p>“Come here you two.” I grabbed Vienna’s head as she resisted in name before crumbling into my embrace.</p><p>“So how are you, Kuroka, Shirone? Did you have fun in Japan?”</p><p>“Yes nyaa~~ We visited the headquarters of the Nura Clan with Magari-sensei. It was so cool.” Kuroka explained her trip animatedly.</p><p>“H-hmm, Kejoro-san was very nice. She cooks tasty food.” She hummed.</p><p>“Oh, Nurarihyon’s home. Did you make friends there?”</p><p>“Y-yes. Everyone was very nice to us. They even invited Onee-chan and me to join the Nura Clan directly under Rikuo-sama. Ah….Rikuo-sama is the….”</p><p>“Grandson of Nurarihyon, a quarter youkai and possibly the third head of the Nura Clan. I know. He invited you two?”</p><p>“He….he said that we were welcome to join them. The others invited us nyaa but we rejected. They didn’t mind though and even taught us their style of Youjutsu involving Fear. I still haven’t learned it properly.”</p><p>“They didn’t force you, did they?” I asked sensing that Kuroka held something back.</p><p>“No nyaa. They didn’t.”</p><p>“What are you hiding, Kuroka?” I asked a bit sterner this time.</p><p>“T-there was a fight. The Shikoku Youkai had attacked. We fought.”</p><p>….</p><p>“When?”</p><p>“It was a month ago. Shirone was in the headquarters but I fought with others. They were quite strong but not my opponents. I defeated six of them alone and the Youkai of the Nura Clan were very impressed. I was even invited by Nurarihyon-sama himself.”</p><p>“Oh!”</p><p>“Yes nyaa. I was invited too. But we didn’t agree. Onee-chan told them that we owed our lives to someone else and would like to serve him. They still thanked us for our help and said we could ask them for anything if we wanted. We were also given some tips about Fear Style of Yojutsu by Nurari-sama and since one of the higher ups of the Nura Clan was killed during the attack, he gave me a territory to rule.”</p><p>“Heh….did they ask anything about me?”</p><p>“They did. We….said that you wanted to keep your identity a secret for now and we won’t reveal it. They didn’t insist much after Magari-sensei had vouched for us. I even got a second tail this time nyaa~”</p><p>And she did. I had noticed it when she had arrived here today but Kuroka now had two tails instead of her normal one. Her aura was also much more controlled.</p><p>“I guess that some congratulations are in order then. Tell me, what do you want for getting a new tail, Kuroka?”</p><p>“Anything, really?” she asked as her ears perked up and her tails swung from side to side.</p><p>“Well as long as it’s within a limit.”</p><p>“Huh? Why does she get a prize while I get nothing, Dummy? I have become stronger too.” Vienna pinched my side.</p><p>“Hmm, I will give you one when you get your next pair of wings. You only have four wings right now.”</p><p>Unlike the Pillar Devils and the Extra Demons, the Satan Descendants had multiple wings which showed their lineages. Others only had a single pair of devil wings no matter how strong they became while the wings of the Satan Descendants increased with their strength. It might have something to do with the fact that all the other devils except the Original Satans were created by Lucifer and Lilith. I am not sure of it. These idiots consider these wings as a sign of their right to rule which according to me is a bunch of crap.</p><p>It looked cool though. Added a lot to the presence.</p><p>I had twelve wings after reaching the Satan Class, the maximum a Devil can get.</p><p>Rizevim has twelve.</p><p>Razevan had twelve but he hid his last pair of wings.</p><p>The idiot trio had ten wings each.</p><p>Vienna on the other hand had four wings, although her strength was stronger than normal four winged devils. Her wings didn’t grow as easily as mine, maybe because of her half human race or the dragon genes. That said, the Divine Dividing more than made up for it.</p><p>“Really! Promise.”</p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p>“Okay, you got it, dummy. Albion was saying that I am almost on the verge of getting my third pair of wings.” She cheered as quickly as she had become angry.</p><p>“In that case, I will prepare a reward for you too and the same goes for Shirone.”</p><p>Shirone’s tails swung from side to side too as she tried to hide her happiness.</p><p>This girl is too adorable.</p><p>“I know what I want nyaa~~”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>“I want you to take me on a date nyaa~ Just the two of us.”</p><p>….</p><p>….</p><p>….</p><p>….</p><p>The impending doom came faster than my Observation could have warned me of.</p><p>Vienna’s demonic power surged as she got a scary smile on her face.</p><p>“Heh….Kuroka, I heard that you became stronger with that new tail. Wanna test it out?” she said as she cracked her fingers.</p><p> “Hah! Sure if you don’t mind getting your butt kicked again.”</p><p>And thus before I could say anything both of them ran ahead to spar.</p><p>Shirone took this opportunity to cuddle into my side as I caressed her head.</p><p><em>“Cleria.”</em> I spoke inside my mind through our connection.</p><p><em>“Yes my Lord.”</em></p><p><em>“How much progress have you made with Annihilation Maker?”</em> I asked.</p><p>I had given Cleria, Annihilation Maker because….I honestly couldn’t think of anyone better who wanted it.</p><p>Cleria was trained in discovering the weakness of the enemy for the use of her Worthless trait. She could easily identify the best route to defeat her enemy and Annihilation Maker would help her do just that.</p><p>Making monsters that can counter her enemies and take advantage of their weaknesses, the Annihilation Maker best suited her style of fighting.</p><p><em>“I have attained the Balance Breaker recently, although I cannot make more than two creatures at once.”</em></p><p><em>“That will be more than enough for now. Can you make the monster I asked you to?”</em></p><p><em>“It was a bit harder to imbue a monster with all those characteristics but I did make a miniature version of it. It has the range of a continent and I can control it to make it anything smaller than that.”</em></p><p><em>“That will do for now. Has a desolate Dimension been found for the test?”</em></p><p><em>“There are many desolate dimensions in the Dimensional Gap. We know of a few that can be used for the tests. Although I don’t think the results will be that good since none of them are as big as a continent nor do they have lives in them. It will not have enough energy for the beast to absorb.”</em></p><p><em>“It will still serve as a good point to test our theory. As for the lives, test and see if the monsters created by Annihilation Maker satisfies the criteria.”</em></p><p><em>“Yes, my Lord. I will set up the first trial in a week.”</em></p><p><em>“If the trial is successful, then find a place inside the ocean where no pantheons have any influence over and set up the Ten Tails to absorb from the sea creatures. I will place an illusion on it to hide it and Gretel will put it behind her Dimension Lost’s barrier. It will be a good place to gather energy from.”</em></p><p><em>“Yes, my Lord.”</em> She answered before we cut off the call.</p><p>That was one of my pet projects. I had the idea when I started the Naruto manga in this world. It was a pretty solid hit too, especially in Japan where the people literally drank in the ninja awesomeness. There were even fans for the Nine Tailed Fox, Kurama among the Youkai children from what I have found out.</p><p>Since Annihilation Maker can create monsters according to the user’s wishes, why can’t it do the same here?</p><p>Since then I made as many notes as I could about the Ten Tails and the process by which it gathers the energy of a planet or a dimension and how it converts it into a Chakra fruit. I even added some modifications about how it can separate the negativity from nature’s energy.</p><p>Even if I absorb a small bit of energy at a time, I can still get mini chakra fruits that can significantly increase the powers of any Youkai that eats them.</p><p>There are also advanced steps of the plan if it succeeds. Innovate Clear used in tandem with the Annihilation Maker can make an idealized world with an increased speed of time where the Ten Tails can suck life without restraint as all the living beings in that world will be under our control. It was basically a chakra fruit orchard if this plan succeeded. All of that if the test succeeds though.</p><p>My plans to see Ten Tailed Nekoshou Goddesses seems to be quite near.</p><p>I looked ahead as Vienna and Kuroka fought, Vienna without using her Sacred Gear. It was an even match.</p><p>Both the girls pushed each other through tricks of their own.</p><p>Vienna under our tutelage is more than just a simple brawler as Vali would have been. She is a sly little minx who would use every chance she could get to dominate a fight completely.</p><p>Observation and Armament Haki played an important part in her fighting styles too. Kuroka used Senjutsu and Touki in return.</p><p>Ice Magic and Yojutsu based flames scattered around the training field as they clashed repeatedly against one another.</p><p>A white haired, black Haki user and a Black haired, white Touki user fought and the scene looked amazing.</p><p>Apparently I was not the only one who thought so as Shirone was also watching the scene with rapt attention.</p><p>They fought for about forty minutes, completely destroying the area around them and then fell on their knees panting for breaths.</p><p>“Let’s make a concession here. How about before the wish Kuroka asked me for, we all go to an amusement park? All of us for a holiday. How do that sound? Good. Then it’s decided. We will go to the amusement park and even have a picnic. I will have Gretel make the arrangements.”</p><p>That should calm the two down.</p><p>It did.</p><p>If Shirone’s tail was an indication of how she felt, then she was absolutely delighted by the idea.</p><p>Vienna’s eyes lit up too.</p><p>This might just be our first holiday together.</p><p><strong>- Scene Change –</strong></p><p>“Are you worried about what Odin said?” Merlin asked sitting beside me as I sat on the roof of the tallest building in our base.</p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p>That thought had haunted my mind since the words it out.</p><p>What would people say if they found out I was a reincarnator?</p><p>Razevan hadn’t told anyone about it but he had watched me around a decade to assure my character and still was a bit reluctant to trust me. Aria’s trust in me could be attributed to her raising me.</p><p>That’s one extreme suspicion and one trust.</p><p>A 50% is not something that eased my mind.</p><p>Would they think differently of me if they found out about my previous life?</p><p>It has kept me up for nights in the last two weeks. I had spent every waking hour training to hide my soul. The problem however was, I had no idea what to do.</p><p>I was broken from my thoughts by Merlin’s voice.</p><p>“It doesn’t matter.”</p><p>….</p><p>I looked at the man and he continued.</p><p>“It doesn’t matter if you are the reincarnation of Lucifer or someone else. Reincarnations are not all like their previous selves. Experiences makes a man. You have experienced different things than Lucifer or Helel for that matter and thus you are a different person. Suddenly finding out that you might have been someone in your previous life doesn’t matter at all. So don’t worry your head about it.”</p><p>“Is it really so easy? Did you not feel anything different when you found out about this?”</p><p>“Hmm, I wouldn’t say I felt nothing. I felt quite surprised. But….yeah that was it. Surprised and then it was back to normal.”</p><p>I looked at the man in disbelief.</p><p>“Let me tell you a story. Arthur….was my student, a friend, like my own son to my first incarnation. When he had died, I was devastated and had half a mind to erase the entire Camelot in my rage. He was the only one I had considered family to me. A true family to me. In my last incarnation, I found his incarnation as well. His name was Felix.” He paused for a moment as if collecting his words or trying to find suitable words to convey what he was about to say. “I killed him.”</p><p>….</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“I killed him. No pretty words. He was a bandit. A murderer. He had killed several villages and pillaged the places. I saw him and I knew at once who he was. It might have been my duty to protect the place or my anger at the piece of shit for defiling the image of my student, I killed him….and I never regretted it once. Arthur was Arthur and Felix was Felix and I knew that. If people didn’t change, then what was the point of reincarnating again? One might be a saint in one life but become a bandit in another. Souls sure have power but they do not set our future in stone. Always remember this fact, Damien. You have lived a life, you died. That was the end. This is not a new chapter. No. This is an entirely new book for you. Write it as you want. Don’t let your previous life cloud your judgement. If you want to continue living as your previous life, sure, do it. I’ll support you. If you want to create a new Devil race, I will support you again. Hell, if you want to open a bar and chill out the entirety of your life this time, I will sit by you and make a drink for myself too. I did swear my loyalty to my King, Damien Lucifer. Him being the reincarnation of Lucifer or anyone else matters not to me or any of your loved ones.”</p><p>....</p><p>….</p><p>….</p><p>….</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>“Always my King. Now you should go and spend some time with others as well. They had been worried sick about you when you didn’t say a word and started training nonstop. Vienna even called those Nekoshou sisters to get you out of training and take some time to relax again. When you have children worried about you, understand that you are doing something wrong. Now, I have heard that you have planned a picnic in an amusement park. Good job. I want a ticket too for all this good advice.”</p><p>I smiled a little and then it turned into a chuckle and finally let out a good laugh.</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>I am having children worried about me.</p><p>Damn, Lucifer wouldn’t have sucked this bad.</p><p>“You know what Merlin? You are right. Who cares what my soul looks like? I have already proclaimed myself as The Devil. If my soul looks like Lucifer’s then he should be proud to have a soul like mine. I will make the name Damien Lucifer surpass the name of Lucifer himself. So much so that if he were to be revived, he would be proud to share the same name as me. I will surpass him and make a place of my own….but first….I have a picnic to plan.”</p><p>“Well said.”</p><p>With those words I got up, feeling a heavy burden lift from my shoulders.</p><p>“Good night.” I said as I walked towards my room. I had already sensed Gretel waiting outside the room for me and Vienna inside the room.</p><p><strong>- Ukiyoe Town, Nura Clan’s Headquarters –</strong></p><p>“I miss Kuroka-chan.” Tsurara said as she slumped into her seat.</p><p>“She said that she will be back in a week.”</p><p>“She did say she was going to visit her friends. Do you think it is that secret Master of hers? I still think it is some bad guy who is tricking her and Shirone and we need to help her.”</p><p>“We need to do nothing. Kuroka is very fond of her other friends and her Master, who has saved her life. He even taught her those fancy tricks. I didn’t know we could use chakra like that. Kuroka is very proficient in Senjutsu and it is very hard to fool her. She will not put Shirone in danger either so if she thought that those people were of any danger to the two of them, she would have ran away. She didn't, which means she cares a lot about them. We need to understand and respect that.”</p><p>“B-b-but Kejoro, she rejected Rokuo-sama’s offer to join the night parade for that Master of hers. How can someone be more cool than Rikuo-sama?”</p><p>The killer monk decided to join the talks at this moment.</p><p>“She also rejected Nurari-sama’s offer to join the Nura Clan as well. Not only she, even little Shirone rejected. They were happy to be friends but they only had their master in their hearts. I think Kuroka likes this master of hers.”</p><p>“What? The Supreme Commander’s invitation?”</p><p>“Hmm. He offered her a town to rule over as a token of appreciation and offered his help in case she needed anything. He seemed to have been trying to get the goodwill of those sisters.”</p><p>“Well they are very talented. Magari-sama said that she might be a once in a generation prodigy. Moreover Shirone shows the same talent. According to Magari-sama, both of those sisters have a high chance to surpass her.”</p><p>“But Magari-sama is a seven tailed Nekomata. That’s….there has never been anyone among the cat Youkai with more than seven tails.”</p><p>“Apparently the training her Master puts her through and the things he has provided her has increased her growth rate without harming her in the slightest. That strange type of chakra has boosted her growth immensely.”</p><p>“So this person, this Master is a man?” Aotabo asked, drinking a cup of his sake.</p><p>“He is. From what I know, he is around the same age as Rikuo-sama and Kuroka.”</p><p>“If so then I hope they can be friends. Kuroka is a very strong and talented Youkai and Shirone is the same. I would like them as allies even if they cannot be a part of our Nura Clan. What do you think, Rikuo-sama?” Kurotabo said as he placed his sake cup on the table.</p><p>The young boy sitting on the cherry blossom tree looked towards the moon. “A friend of our friends is a friend. Kuroka has helped us with the Shikoku Youkai and has won our friendship. Her master will get the same honour from us.”</p><p>“In that case, would you like to invite him over?”</p><p>“….tell them that she is welcome to bring her Master over whenever she wants for tea with us. The Nura Clan always welcomes its guests.” Rikuo spoke.</p><p>The crowd cheered and went on to do their normal routines and party through the night.</p><p>___________________________________x__________________________________________________________________x_______________________________</p><p><strong>Beta Reader: LuluViBritania(FF.N, SB and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note :</strong></p><p><strong>Wow this chapter came a bit late.</strong></p><p><strong>This one takes a lot more time to write than my other fic.

She was ostracized for the same reason as Momiji Nakiri, for being born with an uncontrolled Sacred Gear.</p><p>These bastards call themselves the ‘Five Principal Clans’ and all but they can’t help one of their own, a child, control a power that she had no choice of being born with.</p><p>Mirror Alice is not even as strong as Telos Karma was.</p><p>They could have easily controlled it and even would have increased her strength by a lot.</p><p>In fact the only reason she was not taught all of this was because they disliked the fact that she could use a power that was not ‘their own’.</p><p>I mean just how much fucking pride do they have just on the basis of a Divine Beast who was not even a proper Satan Class?</p><p>Yes, among all five Divine Beast, only the Oryuu was a proper Satan Class entity. The others were at best Peak Ultimate Class.</p><p>This time however I was not the one who went to recruit her. It was Gretel.</p><p>I encouraged both her and Vienna to recruit people in the hopes that they can bond with people other than me. They are too emotionally dependent on me.</p><p>It was hard to do, but she did agree in the end.</p><p>I don’t know if it was her simple nature or Tsubaki’s own background of being shunned by her own family due to having a different power, Gretel and Tsubaki took to each other very readily.</p><p>The second member was Sean Collins or rather Sean ó Coileáin, better known as Chulainn, their names changed over time in history, finally becoming Collins, he is a descendant and inheritor of Cú Chulainn.</p><p>His family had had to change their names several times to hide themselves from people who were trying to hunt them and Sean was left alone with his grandmother.</p><p>I offered him a job and he accepted as long as his grandmother would be taken care of.</p><p>To be honest I was actually surprised that the guy was more amused at me being Lucifer. I thought he would have a prejudice against me or something for….you know, being the Devil and all but instead the guy actually laughed.</p><p>‘The Child of Light’ with the ‘Lightbringer’, why not? Seems pretty fun.</p><p>We are both descendants of Gods of Light.</p><p>I somehow couldn’t find any word to reply for a moment.</p><p>Sean was 16, almost as old as Lavinia and was a very fun guy. This does get him in trouble with Gretel when he isn’t formal with me sometimes.</p><p>Gretel is too particular about such things.</p><p>I however find it more comfortable.</p><p>I am surrounded by girls most of the time and I actually appreciated some good male company sometimes. I did call Magnus who had graduated from his university and was ready to work for me.</p><p>He had been trained regularly and was now pretty adept with both magic and Sacred Gear. Even his girlfriend, Sara, was offered a job in one of Alicia’s new pharmaceutical companies and had moved to our base.</p><p>She was a bit hesitant at first, knowing our identities but later adapted very well. She even accompanied him to learn magic and was given a normal Sacred Gear that gave her enhanced intelligence. Nothing too shabby but nothing to write home about either. She was however very happy with it because it helped her do her job well.</p><p>Ophelia was also thinking about introducing me to her brother Ace but we put that on hold till we were a little older or it would be awkward to hang around someone who was a few hundred years old.</p><p>The third and fourth members were surprising but when I thought about the fifth one, it still didn’t seem that much.</p><p>All three were hero descendants.</p><p>Third one was actually a lucky hit.</p><p>The Fallen Angels had known about the Church’s Sigurd project for a long time. It was not surprising that Valper Galilei was recruited by Kokabiel so soon after his excommunication in canon.</p><p>The information I got about the project actually led me to something beyond my expectations.</p><p>I got the fucking source of everything.</p><p>They were trying to make artificial Siegfried soldiers but where did they get the DNA from?</p><p>How could they even do that?</p><p>The truth was that they had captured the descendant of Siegfried or rather the inheritor or Sigurd and were basically using him to mass produce soldiers.</p><p>And they said that the Holy Sword Project was the only bad one.</p><p>In actuality, it was the only bad one….exposed.</p><p>There is more than one reason why the children went insane.</p><p>First, trying to contain the DNA of someone like that was near impossible for a simple human.</p><p>Second might have something to do with the fact that the child was also a descendant of the crazy Valkyrie Brynhildr making them a very tiny part god. They might have inherited something from her too.</p><p>I also had to wonder what would happen if Brynhildr found out that this descendant was Sigurd’s inheritor and the Church was experimenting on him.</p><p>The Sigurd descendant whose name was also Sigurd because the Church didn’t give a shit about the descendants of Pagan Gods….didn’t bother to name him anything else.</p><p>Oh yes. If this had been the Devils, I would have revealed the news to cause a shitstorm there if only to divert some of their attention from our businesses.</p><p>I sneaked there with Gretel and collected all the possible information and proof that would make it impossible for the Church to deny their involvement with the matter. The material I found was much….much more than I could have expected.</p><p>To discuss everything I had to call Azazel for a meeting.</p><p>And Azazel was serious for the first time since I met him.</p><p>Blackmail materials at its best.</p><p>Sigurd was also 16 and was quite unfamiliar with the outside world. He has been trying to learn about the world and its common sense.</p><p>He is a very polite guy though.</p><p>The fourth was someone who made me doubt if this world was a fucking crossover for a bare moment.</p><p>A pink haired swordswoman who was shunned from her family mostly because she has inherited the powers and skills of her ancestor, Musashi Miyamoto.</p><p>She was however a simple girl of 15 with a passion for swordsmanship and had no Noble Phantasms, much to my hidden disappointment.</p><p>That disappointment didn’t last long enough when we tested her swordsmanship.</p><p>She took down Desmond who was bordering on Ultimate Class and was a pure Knight with her swordsmanship alone.</p><p>Sure Desmond had held back his strength and speed but in terms of swordsmanship alone, she was without any doubt…. a legend.</p><p>I could just imagine her with both Haki, maybe Touki and I could have my very own Saber.</p><p>I whisked her away from their dojo and surprisingly no one even cared or noticed it for a whole week….and they wonder why the Miyamoto family had declined so much.</p><p>Musashi on the other hand was extremely happy in her new home.</p><p>I neared the room and I could hear the ramblings of the fifth member.</p><p>“It’s totally unfair you know? I mean a girl goes to a Church and confesses, ‘Father I have been a bad person, I have sinned. Please punish me.’ The priest listens to her and everything is hunky-dory…. but if the same girl comes to me and says the same thing albeit in slightly different words, it becomes a sin? How is that fair?”</p><p>“So what words did she use?” I heard Sean’s voice.</p><p>“Daddy, I’ve been a bad girl. Punish me.”</p><p>….</p><p>….</p><p>….</p><p>….</p><p>“Eh? How is that bad? Gre-chan, how is that bad?” Lavinia’s clueless voice echoed and I didn’t need my Observation Haki to sense Gretel’s mood. Her rising Demonic Power was enough for that.</p><p>“Mr. Merlin, the toilets haven’t been cleaned yet. Would you like to do the honours?” Gretel’s cold voice sounded as I entered the room.</p><p>“G-Gretel-chan….I was just joking. Joke, a joke.”</p><p>“All the toilets in the building.”</p><p>“YES MA'AM!”</p><p>Yes. I got the inheritor of Merlin.</p><p>Somehow I didn’t get the serious Merlin who had created the entire Modern Human Magic System, I was expecting but instead this goofball 18 year old who looked disturbingly similar to me.</p><p>Merlin Ambrosius, or rather Merlin Asmodeus, was a half-human son of Asmodeus. He was shunned obviously as is the case with the Half Devil descendants of the Satan Clans or any Devil clans to be honest so he went ahead and gave Humans the knowledge to use calculations to recreate Devil Magic and reduce their reliance on deals from the entire Devil Race. It was a solid move to be honest. It did more harm to the entire Devil Race than the entire Church Faction could do since its foundation.</p><p>He even went ahead and trained Arthur Pendragon who shafted the Devils quite well in his lifetime.</p><p>In a weird sort of way, this person is the inheritor as well as the descendant of my half-brother.</p><p>Our meeting was the weirdest of all too.</p><p>It was quite the opposite of how things went generally.</p><p><strong>- Flashback –</strong></p><p>I walked into the café with Magnus to check on my new recruit.</p><p>Merlin.</p><p>THAT was not a name I was expecting to get from Azazel.</p><p>Then again he sent me this name because of his relation to the Original Asmodeus.</p><p>It was surprising but then again understandable. Merlin, the creator of the Modern Human Magic System in this world, was the son of a Satan. It kinda matched with his background in some of the anime I had seen with him being a half Incubus as Asmodeus was a similar demon. Then again it made sense with Human Magic being so similar to the Devil Magic system, the existence of contract magicians who wanted to learn magic from the Devils.</p><p>This man was probably just as famous if not more, in the entire human world than even his own father, my father….kinda sorta, who was a Satan for fuck’s sake.</p><p> We took a seat on one of the empty tables and I found that he was already looking at us.</p><p>I noticed the girls in the restaurant staring at both of us despite me being slightly lower than thirteen years old.</p><p>Looking closely I realized that he had inherited Asmodeus’ magic. The charm was passive.</p><p>Magnus realized the strangeness and looked towards me with a questioning gaze but I waved it off.</p><p>We had some coffee in peace.</p><p>No words were said.</p><p>At the end of it, all three of us walked out together.</p><p>Magnus was the only one confused.</p><p>“So, the Devils couldn’t stand coming for my head?” he said as he walked casually. Although the words were said casually, I had sensed his magic moving in preparation already.</p><p>I raised an eyebrow, “‘The’ Devils? As far as I know there is only one Devil who can be called ‘The’ Devil, and that’s me and I am not here for your head.” I don’t know if it’s in the blood or something but I feel slightly annoyed whenever someone claims to be ‘The Devil’. Is this Lucifer's Sin of Pride?</p><p>I mean if I could inherit their powers so who says I couldn’t inherit other things. I think I didn’t realize it fully in the Old Satan faction because of how occupied or suppressed I was. That said even then I have had bouts of this sometimes.</p><p>Azazel did say that every Lucifer Descendant has this without fail. It is annoying but I can mostly manage it with Occlumency. It is still a massive pain in the ass.</p><p>The man looked towards with a slightly wide eyed expression which turned into an amused smile.</p><p>“Oh My, so why does ‘The’ Devil want to meet Lil ol’ me?”</p><p>“I want to invite you to join me?”</p><p>His steps faltered for a moment before he burst out in a laugh. “Those old bastards want me back? Ah yes, I did hear that they were beaten black and blue in the Civil War and were forced to hide in some rat hole somewhere in the world. So now they need my help and want me back?” His voice started in a joking tone but there was an undeniable line of ruthlessness in it and by the end of it, it had turned into a mocking tone.</p><p>“Those old guys could die in a ditch for all I care. I am here to ask you to join <em>my</em> team. Not those old guys, not the new guys….<em>mine</em>.”</p><p>“Hoho now that does sound interesting but before I join you, could you tell me something about yourself? It is only natural to know the name of my future boss.” He laughed.</p><p>I didn’t pay any attention to his behavior while also thanking that I hadn’t brought Gretel with me or she could have been pissed off at his frivolous behavior. “My name is Damien Lucifer and I guess you can add Asmodeus to it as well.” If he doesn’t join me, I could always have his memories about me erased through the Broker Essence.</p><p>“Heh, a Lucifer and an Asmodeus had a child? I didn’t think it was possible. Their bloods wouldn’t have agreed to be subservient to each other. I had in my previous incarnation calculated the probability of such a childbirth and it was a one in a million….by Devil standards. You can really call yourself one in a million hahahahaha.”</p><p>“I was created by the blood of the Original Lucifer and Original Asmodeus artificially.”</p><p>His laughter stopped, “That’s impossible. The bloods would react heavily against each other and would simply destroy each other.”</p><p>“And yet I am here.”</p><p>“Then you have been lied to. Such a thing is impossible.”</p><p>I looked at Magnus and nodded my head. Merlin looked warily at us. Magnus brought out his Sacred Gear while I cast a barrier around the area. Magnus manipulated the mechanical parts on one of the electronic billboards to make birds of metal and sent them my way. I lifted my hand and the birds were rendered into a heap of iron falling down.</p><p>Merlin had his mouth opened slightly, “That’s Sacred Gear Canceller….no….no….that’s ….but that is not possible. Only ‘He’ could use the ‘Denial of the Divine’….you.”</p><p>“I guess this proves my claim of being a Lucifer.”</p><p>The startled man gained his bearings soon and collected himself remarkably quickly, “That while surprising was not the problem in the first place. You look like a mini Lucifer. I’d have believed you even without it with that face and that Demonic Power reserve. The problem is you being both a Lucifer and Asmodeus.”</p><p>Before he could say anything, I snapped my fingers and the pile of iron burst into Blue Flames completely erasing it from existence.</p><p>This time I didn’t say anything to get the open mouthed man’s attention. I just dispelled the barrier and walked along with Magnus who was putting money near the place where the electronic board stood.</p><p>We walked a few steps ahead and were soon followed by a rushing Merlin who directly grabbed me by my shoulder, “Tell me more about yourself.”</p><p>And that led us to a pizza store where we sat over for several hours while I explained my identity to him.</p><p>“Hahahaha wonderful. That was really wonderful. Those cranky bastards really deserved it.” he held his stomach by the time I finished the story. “So, what do I have to do to join you?”</p><p>I raised an eyebrow, “You trust me? Aren’t you doubting that I might lie?”</p><p>He waved his hand, “Nah, you are still inexperienced.”</p><p>My fingers twitched while I wanted to use ‘The Prince of Lies’ and show him just how big the world is, I would rather keep my trump cards to myself.</p><p>“You just need to swear your loyalty to me. I will provide you with protection and support and in return you will always be loyal to me. Do we have a deal?”</p><p>“A deal eh? Just like The Devil. Something tells me that it is not so simple but I am willing to trust my instincts this time.” He smiled. “Deal.”</p><p>And thus the deal was finalized. It was the weirdest recruitment I had ever made. Even while making the recruitment I didn’t feel that it was me who was in control the entire time.</p><p>I later came to know why.</p><p>That bastard had an uncontrolled precognition ability.</p><p>He could see snippets of the future.</p><p>He already knew that I was going to come and he had planned to agree from the very start.</p><p>It kinda reminded me of the Fate Merlin, although nowhere near his level.</p><p><strong>- Flashback End –</strong></p><p>The only thing that I hadn’t known at that time was the annoying playboy habits.</p><p>He started with Gretel which led the man to be admitted into the hospital soon after.</p><p>Sure he was strong but his devil blood had been diluted several times over the generations and he was only an exceptional mage, a young one at that.</p><p>He was without a doubt an Ultimate Class even with that but Gretel was someone who could fight a Satan Class with her Sacred Gear.</p><p>She didn’t go serious but the guy still ended up in the hospital because even during the fight, he kept teasing Gretel.</p><p>He recovered very quickly and started his work with Helena. He had asked for copies of the books we had copied from the Dantalion’s Library and had spent all of his free time reading.</p><p>He was extremely fascinated with the research that we were doing, especially the Shadow Clone Jutsu which he has named ‘The Researcher’s Wet Dream.’</p><p>“Boss! Help me.” He jumped towards me as soon as I entered the room.</p><p>I dodged and took a seat on the side.</p><p>“Has there been any news from Azazel yet?”</p><p>“Yes. He will be waiting for us at the same place. We were asked to go to the room whenever we are ready.” Gretel answered with a slight bow.</p><p>“Well then let’s get this over with already. Gretel.”</p><p>She nodded and a grayish mist surrounded us soon and we left the base.</p><p>Merlin threw me a look of thanks.</p><p><strong>- Scene Change –</strong></p><p>“No matter how many times I see this, I always envy it. Can you imagine the uses of this Sacred Gear? You can peak wherever you want and run off without ever being caught? This is the dream Sacred Gear of all….gentlemen.”</p><p>I deadpanned at the guy while walking between a seething Gretel. Merlin somehow knows the exact things to say to irritate her.</p><p>“Sometimes I wonder if you have a hidden masochistic trait somewhere.” I said looking at the man.</p><p>“Hmm, pain in pleasure. Hasn’t it always been the case though? People work so hard, bear so much pain ultimately it is all for the sake of gaining a more pleasurable life. How am I any different?”</p><p>….</p><p>“You know boss. There is a point in what he said.” Sean whispered slowly.</p><p>“Eh? Really? In that case I’ll send you both to volunteer for the next batch of drugs that we make. Those experiments will <em>really</em> be pleasurable for you guys.”</p><p>“Ahh, well….I was just saying that he has a point, not that I am interested in it.” the guy backed down in a hurry.</p><p>“What is this place? Why are there so many women dressed like this?” Sigurd asked, looking outside the one way glass window and into the bar.</p><p>“This, my friend, is a place of culture. I mean if even a dignified leader of the Fallen Angels thinks so, then there has to be a certain truth to it. This is called the ‘Oppai Club’.”</p><p>I held Gretel’s hand lightly and smiled slightly.</p><p>The only reason why I am not stopping Merlin’s antics is because Gretel and all the other younger members really need it.</p><p>Merlin really knows how to push everyone’s buttons and anger them while I want them to know of their weak points and learn to control them. Despite his goofball attitude, Merlin has a very high IQ and EQ.</p><p>This incarnation of Merlin has inherited a lot of his knowledge and is without a doubt one of the best teachers one can get in this whole world.</p><p>It is for this reason we have a tacit understanding. As long as he doesn’t cross a line, I allow him to mess with the other members.</p><p>It wouldn’t do for my members to lose their temper in a moment of heat in a battle and then suffer for it.</p><p>As I was thinking of these things, the door to our room opened and in came Azazel.</p><p>“Oh, that’s quite a gathering you got there. So enjoying the show?” He asked, looking at the others.</p><p>Merlin gave the man thumbs up with both hands while Sean looked at me or rather Gretel behind me and then chose not to answer.</p><p>Sigurd was the politest one as he slightly bowed his head.</p><p>The man looked at Sigurd and barely held a hint of grimace.</p><p>“That bad huh?”</p><p>He slumped into the seat and I signaled Gretel to pour him out a glass of alcohol.</p><p>He downed the glass in a single gulp before replying, “Worse.”</p><p>“I used the information you gave me to verify how exactly the Church had gotten their hands on Sig here. It was a huge mess.”</p><p>Sig probably wanting to know more about himself listened attentively.</p><p>I noticed that while Sean didn’t show it and looked uninterested, he was paying very close attention to the subject as well.</p><p>Those two were recruited at the same time and have been very close to each other.</p><p>Merlin was also showing a rare moment of seriousness.</p><p>“So before I start this, tell me, do you know of the story of Sigurd or more importantly how he died?”</p><p>“Yes. I would appreciate your point of view all the same though. After all, I find it hard to believe telltales.”</p><p>“Sigurd had climbed to the top of Mt. Hindarsfjall met Brynhildr, one of the strongest Valkyries and the daughter of Odin and saved her from a long sleep. There was however a prophecy that if they met each other, their lives would be hurled into ruin and he would die. He still did that to save her and had decided not to fall in love with her but….love is a strange thing. They lived together while Sigurd steeled himself to fight the Prophecy. He took her as his wife and she taught him of the Runes that she had learned from her father.”</p><p>He took another glass of his alcohol before continuing, “He then went on to continue his journey as a hero. That’s when this situation started becoming bad. Somewhere during this time, he was tricked into drinking wine that made him forget about Brynhildr. This was done by Gunther, his own brother-in-law who also wanted to marry Brynhildr. He however knew that he couldn’t fulfill the condition of defeating her in a fight to get her hand so he played a trick.” He looked at Sigurd and continued as the man was trying to recover from the shock of the situation and it was here I realized that Sigurd had died without even knowing about the truth. “He asked help from Sigurd, the one she loved the most in the world. They disguised Sigurd using runes he had learned from her, used the fighting skills he had learned from her to defeat her in the battle and present her to his brother-in-law as a wife….all the while she knew the truth.”</p><p>I instantly put a barrier around us as the man in question looked devastated and the furniture in the room were crushed into dust from the power his body was radiating. The power had a major aura of a dragon with a slight hint of divinity. Sean hurried over and grabbed his shoulders trying to calm him down.</p><p>I too used my Bewitching Voice as well as the Bune’s Dragon tamer ability to help him calm down.</p><p>“Calm down Sigurd. Losing your temper like this won’t give you anything. Save this anger for those who really deserve it….and if they are dead, then to make yourself stronger so that such a thing never happens again. A blade is of no use if it loses its temper.”</p><p>It took a few moments but he took a deep breath and regained himself.</p><p>Looking at him calm down, Azazel continued again. “Brynhildr accepted her fate at the start but later she was overcome by the indignation and attacked Sigurd, cutting him in half.”</p><p>There were varied reactions from everyone. Sean bristled but controlled himself. Merlin merely closed his eyes while the guy in question breathed out softly. “I deserved it.”</p><p>“You didn’t. You had no idea.” Sean argued.</p><p>“It still doesn’t change the fact that I wronged her.”</p><p>“The ones who wronged her were the ones who conspired against you two. It was not your fault.” I assured the guy as well.</p><p>“It wasn’t your fault kid. Odin believed that too. Infact when Brynhildr found out about the truth, she tried to commit suicide to reunite with you but instead went into a coma for several hundred years. Later she forcibly put herself in an enchanted sleep to wait for you if you returned and forgave her someday. Odin on the other hand had rampaged ruthlessly and crushed all those who were involved in the conspiracy and that….that’s how we reached here. One of the survivors of that incident, the descendant of Gunther had made his own family and swore revenge on Odin and Brynhildr. His descendants had found out that you had been incarnated and sold you to the church people. The church had been trying to collect weapons from all the factions to boost their power. This included Gram and the other swords associated with your legend. Odin hadn’t paid much attention to this back then but now….I am afraid he might start a war against Heaven and the Church and if that happens, we will have to be involved too.”</p><p>….</p><p>“The Devils haven’t endeared themselves to any faction with their Evil Pieces either and now even the Church is being involved in such things. I can somehow understand Odin’s feelings regarding this situation.”</p><p>“I don’t want there to be any war. Many people are uninvolved in this. I don’t want to be the cause of their deaths.” Sigurd shook his head.</p><p>“Trust me kid, none of us want a war. We will convince Odin too but I believe your words would be more reliable in this case. Damien, I think it would be better if you go there too. I am sure that Odin won’t deny your request as you are Sigurd’s savior.”</p><p>I can also use it to establish a good relationship with the Norse.</p><p>Looking at the tense atmosphere in the room I ordered.</p><p>“Gretel, take Sigurd and Sean back to the base. He might need some rest after all this emotional news. I will call you back when we are ready to leave.”</p><p>“Yes Master.”</p><p>Grayish mist spread over the room as she left with Sigurd and Sean leaving Azazel, Merlin and I in the room.</p><p>“I had given the information about you to Damien but I never expected you to actually join him. How have you been, old friend?” Azazel asked, looking at Merlin.</p><p>“Fate works in mysterious ways. I quite like this half-brother of mine. So much better than those stuck-up pricks. Moreover he’s so….interesting. A true miracle if you will. I wouldn’t have been able to sleep with the curiosity if I had let him go.”</p><p>“It seems you remember most of your past life.”</p><p>“Most.”</p><p>Looking at my confused look, Azazel clarified, “I was the one who had helped Merlin back when he had escaped. We bonded over the beauty of the female body and research of magic.”</p><p>“Those were the times.”</p><p>No lies.</p><p>“What is your opinion on this matter?” Azazel asked Merlin who simply shrugged and slumped back into his couch.</p><p>“I will follow whatever my new King says. Last time I had helped Arthur grow just to piss off the Devils. I never skived my duty mind you but my motivation was pretty personal. This time I want to see this King of mine grow, while teaching some of the people with the most potential in the whole world.”</p><p>Azazel raised an eyebrow and picked up another glass. “You sound very relaxed this time.”</p><p>“I am. The ones I had a grudge with are already several feet under the ground or hiding like rats. The new ones while still containing some of those annoying oldies are still much more bearable and I am with people similar to me. Vienna is so adorable. I would have thought that after what I did to them, they would have known better than to harm the mothers of half-devils like my previous self but….some people never change. Well this time I would like to see just what kind of punishment Damien delivers unto them. It is a rare chance to see The Devil in action.”</p><p>“Are you really going to fight them?” Azazel asked, looking at me.</p><p>“Do you truly think they would let me go if I did nothing? Moreover, I have made a promise, a deal and my deal is my bond. Rizevim and Euclid will die. I couldn’t care less about the others.” I said in a monotone. There was just too much to just turn back now.</p><p>“<em>Sigh</em> Let’s put that aside for now. What do you plan to do with the current situation?”</p><p>“What do you advise Merlin?” I asked, looking at him.</p><p>“War is out of the question. War would drag us into this mess despite you wanting otherwise, just because of our identities. Moreover the Old Satan faction would definitely use this as an opportunity to take advantage of. It is even more so for Heaven and the Church than for us so the only thing they can do is negotiate. I think getting back the swords of the Norse along with something that belonged to the Church as compensation. Punish the people who were involved and get some of the children who were a part of the Project. They after all contain the blood of Odin, no matter how dilute. The Church will obviously be resistant to the advice of a ‘Mere Fallen’ or a ‘Pagan God’ so pressure and blackmail them.”</p><p>Azazel nodded back, “I had similar thoughts. Michael would agree. He already has more than enough trouble managing the System as it is. He wouldn’t want to be stuck with it in the middle of a war.” he turned towards me, “So, what do YOU want out of this?”</p><p>Me.</p><p>What do I want?</p><p>“A nun in training named Asia Argento. She is currently in one of the Churches of Italy and possesses the Twilight Healing. I want her.”</p><p>There was a very important reason for choosing her. It was not because she was a so-called canon character. I had already gotten over that.</p><p>The main reason was her Dragon Tamer ability. The strongest creatures in this world are Dragons and Gods. My Denial of the Divine can somewhat restrain a Divine but the Dragon is still an uncontrollable factor.</p><p>I have been using all my power to prepare for it.</p><p>My own Bune’s Dragon tamer ability from Gregory, Ingvild’s Nereid Kyrie and even some other Sacred Gears with anti-dragon abilities, are all my preparations.</p><p>Asia Argento is someone whose Dragon tamer ability allowed her to tame hundreds of Evil Dragons. She is a must get for me.</p><p>This is the only reason why I have put her value above even the piece of Holy Grail which can help and enhance the power of the Sephiroth Graal or anything else.</p><p>Azazel and Merlin both looked at me weirdly. “A girl?”</p><p>“Twilight Healing, while rare, is not a unique one. Why do you want her specifically?”</p><p>“I have my reasons.”</p><p>He raised both his hands, “Hey, who among us has never had a nun fetish? In Fact Merlin has had his fair share.”</p><p>“Ehh, boss, could it be that you were inspired by my joke today? You want a confession from a naughty nun too?”</p><p>I deadpanned at the man, “And you wonder why Gretel is so annoyed with you all the time?”</p><p>“Ah Gretel-chan is very strict with anyone who is not you. By the way….” He got closer to me and whispered, “What’s the deal between you two? I mean, everyone already thinks there is something going on but no one dares to confirm that. I bet the only ones with the courage to do that would be Lavinia and Vienna but they are too innocent to be set on such a risky venture.”</p><p>“Yeah yeah what <em>is</em> the deal between you two?” Azazel poked too.</p><p>“I am thirteen. What do you expect me to say?”</p><p>“Ehh, I lost my virginity at 11. Don’t disappoint me lil bro.” Merlin cried.</p><p>“Exactly. Don’t tell me you are waiting for adulthood or some crap like that? Above 18 is something humans have decided. We grow differently.”</p><p>“Hah….it’s not like that. Gretel and I….we have been through too many things together. She probably knows more about me than anyone else in this world and has pulled me out from a situation which could have left me as an emotionless murder-machine. We have been together since our childhoods and I wouldn’t be surprised if our relationship went further and developed into something more but….she is also too emotionally reliant on me. If I ask her, she would agree without a doubt but I would never know if she is doing that because she wants to or just because she felt she owed me. That’s why I am waiting for her to grow a bit more emotionally independent. I don’t want her regretting her decision later.”</p><p>….</p><p>“Heh, so you have thought about it.”</p><p>“Good to see that my dear brother is so thoughtful. But….that doesn’t mean you can’t what’s the current term….well get to know someone else?” Merlin elbowed me slightly.</p><p>“Yes yes there’s a saying from a very wise man, ‘Practice makes a man perfect’.”</p><p>“Isn’t that the line you invented to seduce married women back in the middle ages?” Merlin suddenly said something utterly unbelievable out of nowhere.</p><p>“YOU INVENTED THAT!?”</p><p>“Hey, it was meant for good. Not my fault that it also worked as a wonderful pickup line.”</p><p>I somehow feel violated having used that line so many times in my life.</p><p>The talks went on from one topic to another and I returned back to my base late at night.</p><p>It was decided that we will meet Odin a week later.</p><p><strong>- Scene Change –</strong></p><p>I came here with Vienna to possibly make a Deal for a Sacred Gear.</p><p>The special thing about this visit is that this is the one Albion was waiting for a long time.</p><p><strong><em>“Are you sure that he will agree?”</em></strong> Albion called out from Vienna’s wings?</p><p>“Absolutely. I just want you to remember your promise afterwards.”</p><p><strong><em>“I don’t go back on my words.”</em></strong></p><p>“And neither do I.”</p><p>I found my target trying in front of us.</p><p>“Is that the person?”</p><p>“Yup.”</p><p>Vienna however was a little pissed off. “How is that possible? My rival? THAT? Are you sure you didn’t hit your head in some training, Dummy?” she asked, pointing at the brown haired kid staring at the girls walking by and guessing their breast sizes.</p><p>I am honestly amazed why no one is carrying him off to his parents and giving him a strict lecture.</p><p>“Okay, I’ll go and make the deal.”</p><p><strong><em>“Be sure to record it.”</em></strong></p><p>“I am.”</p><p>I walked to the kid who looked at me and….had the fucking gall to click his tongue. “Damn pretty boy. What do you want?”</p><p>….Yeah, no regrets.</p><p>Oh who am I kidding, I am the fucking Devil. I do not regret.</p><p>“Oh! You have a problem with me? And here I was thinking of trading these Oppai pictures with you.” I brought out a few pictures from Merlin's collections.</p><p>He had been too enthusiastic to lend them to me, giving me a knowing look. Oh, if only he knew.</p><p>“OPPAI!”</p><p>He looked at the pictures almost drooling and I seriously tried to check if he had some kind of spell on him.</p><p>I pulled the pictures back. “Now now, I said trade not donate.”</p><p>“What do you want?”</p><p>“Hmm, I want….lets say a certain artifact you have.”</p><p>“Artifact? Like in Dungeon Hunter?”</p><p>“Kinda similar. Anyways, you just need to agree to give me an artifact of my choice from you and I can give you five boob pictures. How about it? Fair deal?”</p><p>He nodded as a pendulum and I for a moment felt sorry for Ddraig. “Yup Deal.”</p><p>And I brought out five pictures from my pocket and gave them to him.</p><p>“Here, deal complete.”</p><p>He took the photos and opened them, “HEY THESE ARE ANIMAL BOOBS. I DON’T WANT THAT?”</p><p>“What do you mean? I never said I would give human boob pictures. Giving such things to children is illegal.”</p><p>His cries didn’t matter.</p><p>I had completed the deal according to my words.</p><p>And I already had the Boosted Gear.</p><p>I signed a premade contract to store the Boosted Gear in it before Ddraig could say anything and teleported.</p><p><strong>- Scene Change –</strong></p><p>“My Eternal Rival was a pervert.” Vienna sighed for I don’t know how many times now.</p><p>“You don’t have to get so down about it Vi. He is no longer your eternal rival.” I sighed.</p><p>“You don’t understand Dummy. How am I supposed to show everyone how awesome I am if I can’t even fight a good opponent and win my fated duel?”</p><p>“You get defeated by almost everyone here, shorty. I think you should concentrate on that.” Sean commented earning a glare which was more adorable than intimidating in return.</p><p>“Hmph. You people don’t understand it. Tell them something, Albion.”</p><p><strong><em>“I am going to hold this over Ddraig’s head till either of us dies.”</em></strong> Albion didn’t sound unhappy. In Fact the deal we had was that he won’t start unnecessary fights with Ddraig if I give him something extraordinarily embarrassing to hold over Ddraig’s head. I bet being traded for five pictures of animal breasts did the trick.</p><p>“So now you have both the Dragon Emperors on your side? Any idea who gets the Boosted Gear?” Merlin asked. He was a bit disappointed when he found out the reasons for me borrowing the pictures.</p><p>“No idea. I will see who gets it? Do any of you want it?” I asked, looking towards them.</p><p>“My sword is enough for me.” Musashi denied.</p><p>“I just need a good spear.” Sean looked uninterested too.</p><p>Sigurd looked very lost so I didn’t ask him.</p><p>“Miss Helena has offered me the Innovate Clear after she is done researching it. I think that one would suit me better.” Merlin denied it as well.</p><p>Helena has been keeping Innovate Clear under enchantments while researching it but such a thing could be disastrous if it was found by anyone.</p><p>It would raise too many unnecessary questions and suspicions on her and I don’t want that.</p><p>She has basically been using Innovate Clear to temporarily make plants for ingredients and suitable conditions for making certain drugs or conducting experiments.</p><p>Innovate Clear is extremely suited to such things.</p><p>It’s like having a place where you can do any experiment or practice. Basically a Room of Requirement without any caps.</p><p>What Merlin does however is different. His idea of using it is like a Reality Marble which assists him in his spell casting which is truly terrifying.</p><p>He could fight an Ultimate Class but that was only because of his current level of magic reserves. His knowledge and skill level are a solid Satan Class. The way he runs circles around Vienna and the new recruits even if they are all working together is a sight.</p><p>If Innovate Clear is added to it….</p><p>Yeah, that would be a sight to behold.</p><p>“You know, you could always try to learn Albion’s abilities. With the powers I have given you, learning them should not be impossible. I am pretty sure you would become stronger if you could use it in tandem with Albion.” I suggested.</p><p>“I can?” she asked confused,</p><p>I had kept the true extent of the abilities of Archmage from her because knowing her, she would try something <em>‘awesome’</em> and get hurt in the process.</p><p>I touched her forehead and softly incanted, “Divide.”</p><p>I felt a tiny amount of power enter my body. Well tiny for me but half her power for Vienna.</p><p>“Hah?”</p><p><strong><em>“You really did succeed. I had my doubts when you had asked my permission but this….”</em></strong> Albion was stunned.</p><p>“Hey, if young welsh dragons sealed in the Boosted Gear could do that then why not me?”</p><p><strong><em>“True I suppose. But even then, even a single count of Divide can help you immensely in battle. My abilities show their true power if my wielders are stronger. The more energy they can bear, the more useful my abilities will be for them.”</em></strong></p><p>“Hmm. It is still incredibly hard to do.”</p><p><strong><em>“It is obviously hard. It is a part of the Principle of Supremacy. It is one of the handful of magics that I can use despite my full power. That’s the price I paid to learn it. You learning it is already nothing short of a miracle. Moreover my abilities are much harder than the Red One’s. The Red One only needs the strength of his soul to Boost the power of a spell while I and my Divide need to overcome the will and magic of others to divide their powers and then change it into my own. Moreover there is always a chance that the other party might be too strong and just let their power go, in which case, the user will overload and die. The Red One doesn’t have to worry about these things.”</em></strong> Albion explained patiently.</p><p>“You know, if I didn’t know better, I would say you respect the Red One, as you call him, a lot.” Sean asked, intrigued by our conversation.</p><p><strong><em>“I might despise him but that is because of our very beliefs. I divide while he boosts. We are the antithesis of each other so we fight to prove whose way is better. In a normal fight my user can just keep siphoning power from him while his boost would at most keep him at his normal level while I become stronger. In such cases it should result as my complete win. But there is also the case that the Red One doesn’t need anyone else to increase his power while I do. He could make his attacks stronger even without anyone or anything to siphon from. So, I might despise him but I also respect him. Just no common weakling can be called the Eternal Rival of the Vanishing Dragon.”</em></strong></p><p>“It does put a lot of strain on the soul.”</p><p><strong><em>“Dragon’s Magic is especially reliant on the soul. Boost and Divide are the strongest among such magic below the Dragon God Levels. Obviously they will put a lot of strain on the soul. You should work on improving your soul’s power.”</em></strong></p><p>I have been trying to do so but there haven’t been any results yet.</p><p>I am quite wary of letting anyone near my soul because of what that ‘Devil’ might have done or from the fear of them figuring out that I am not from this world.</p><p>Maybe if I can bind Valerie but the Vampire faction has been closed off. They have been trading with Ophelia but the knowledge of the happenings of the Tepes Castle has been closed off.</p><p>I have tried to discover what has been happening there but with no results. Even the nobles who trade with Ophelia either kept their mouths shut or just had no idea.</p><p>Infiltrating the Vampires is hard because those bastards never leave their homes. All trades are carried out by the thralls or lower class vampires.</p><p>For a self-proclaimed noble race, they are just a bunch of pussies.</p><p>As I was thinking about these, I got a message from Ophelia, <strong><em>“Master. We have got information about the Naberius House. The people from the branch house are conducting experiments on the Youkai as you had predicted. I made some of them sign our loyalty contracts and made them a part of the project. One of the twins is reaching his limits while the sister is not involved in the experiments. There are talks about her being included. What are your orders?”</em></strong></p><p>“Have you found enough information to make sure that they cannot hide it or shirk responsibility.”</p><p><strong><em>“Yes Master. That said we have caught a hint of something else.”</em></strong></p><p>“Oh!”</p><p><strong><em>“The Head of the Naberius has had something imported from the flying city Agreas.”</em></strong></p><p>“The one where the crystals of the Evil Pieces are produced?”</p><p><strong><em>“Yes Master. We have no idea what it is but apparently it was something that was done with the help of Abnus Beelzebub. It might be prudent to find out about it.”</em></strong></p><p>Abnus Beelzebub, the elder brother of Shalba, while not as strong as him, was still relatively strong. He had attacked the underworld after he had mutated somehow and gained enough power to liquefy the surroundings with his poison.</p><p>He was killed by Sirzechs who had to use his True Form to do so. I am pretty sure that it means he was above Satan Class.</p><p>No one could find out how those mutations occurred though.</p><p>The Naberius have always been close to the Beelzebub. Do they have something to do with it?</p><p>Agreas was the city where the research and experiments of the Original Satans were carried out.</p><p>Enhancement Drug or some kind?</p><p>Somehow the topic made me uneasy. Maybe I’ll look into it.</p><p>“Keep watch. If any of the twins snap and there are accidents, help them escape and hide them. Make sure your identity is not revealed. Also try to get someone inside the Naberius House. I have an uneasy feeling about this.”</p><p><strong><em>“Yes Master.”</em></strong></p><p>“We will meet the Youkai when we disclose the Naberius incident. Make sure that the involvement of the Old Satan Faction is hidden. Not completely but not enough to pin the blame of the experiments on them.”</p><p>_________________________________x__________________________________________________________________x_________________________________</p><p><strong>Beta Reader: LuluViBritania(FF.N, SB and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note :</strong></p><p><strong>I was supposed to complete this chapter two days ago but got stuck with work.</strong></p><p><strong>Anyways, Damien has gotten his hands on some of the people Azazel informed him about.</strong></p><p><strong>Some people complained about there being too many OCs but in my opinion in a world like DxD, using only a handful of characters is an utter waste.</strong></p><p><strong>I won’t be adding any more OCs who will be a major part of the story so no need to worry about it but these characters bring more depth to the story.</strong></p><p><strong>To be honest the characters in DxD and how they were portrayed was downright awful. Issei made me cringe so bad that I stopped watching the anime all together after season three. The LN was more bearable but then again I am of the opinion that Ichibumi made all the characters so dumb so that Issei may look….well normal in comparison.</strong></p><p><strong>Then again that is my opinion.</strong></p><p><strong>I wanted Damien to have some bro characters because the group was getting too serious.</strong></p><p><strong>Merlin was an absolute genius of an idea suggested to me.</strong></p><p><strong>Half Incubus and in many mythologies mentioned as a Cambion, was the perfect fit for this role.</strong></p><p><strong>He could be a teacher figure for the group as well as a comedic relief. I have also tried to make him somewhat different from the versions we know of.</strong></p><p><strong>The Cu and Sigurd inheritors were added to make a bigger fighting force for Damien.</strong></p><p><strong>The five people he had marked couldn’t appear in public to fight for Damien because of their own identities so he needs to make a decent force for himself.</strong></p><p><strong>A force enough for others to not challenge him willy-nilly.</strong></p><p><strong>Making alliances will allow him to make his group recognized and not be considered a bunch of strays or terrorists.</strong></p><p><strong>The Old Satan faction cannot be declared as terrorists due to political reasons but that doesn’t mean that a runaway from that faction who refused to join the current government is in the same situation.</strong></p><p><strong>Damien is trying to avoid all this.</strong></p><p><strong>This requires both power and influence(favours) with other factions, one of the major reasons why Damien is planning all this.</strong></p><p><strong>As for Valerie, please remember that no matter a Dhampir or not, she is still the daughter of the Leader of the Tepes faction. Kidnapping her might cause too much trouble if done without proper planning. Damien cannot just walk in and take her away. That would cause huge problems.</strong></p><p><strong>We will see some major plot advancements in the future chapters.</strong></p><p><strong>I also remember someone saying that Damien should control the minds of some businessmen or the underworld. Well logically speaking, in a world so well connected with the Supernatural, what do you think are the chances of high profile people being connected with the supernatural? Very high in my opinion. It could and would attract too much attention if such a thing happens and gets caught. Damien doesn’t have too many Binder Slots for everyone.</strong></p><p><strong>The Underworld would without a doubt be under the control of the real underworld. Damien is still trying to hide himself until he reaches the Super Devil level at the very least so he can’t make any moves that are too overt.</strong></p><p><strong>If you find any other plot holes regarding the story, please message me. I am trying to reduce them as much as possible but I am pretty sure I will miss one or two.</strong></p><p><strong>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br></p>",

    "content": "<p><strong>Disclaimer: I own nothing.</strong></p><p><strong>Chapter 11: Meetings.</strong></p><p><strong>- Damien –</strong></p><p>I sat in the private room of a bar, waiting for the other party to arrive. The only one accompanying me is Gretel in case we need to leave with Dimension Lost.</p><p>It has been six months since we escaped from the Old Satan Faction.</p><p>These six months have been extremely productive for my entire group.</p><p>Kuroka had been the first one to get a hang of Chakra in merely two weeks followed by Shirone. Youkai had an innate advantage when trying to control their life-force and spiritual power. Those are basically Touki and Youjutsu. I wonder if Kuroka can somehow use the Naruto style Senjutsu by absorbing Nature’s energy and balancing it within her own body. That would surely increase her strength by a lot.</p><p>The Nekoshou however unlike normal humans from the Naruto world had much more chakra reserves due to being a supernatural race.</p><p>It kind of made me wonder the similarities between the Senjutsu of this world and how the Otsutsuki’s like Kaguya, Hagoromo, Hamura and the others used chakra – without any hand signs, directly manipulating the chakra.</p><p>It was probably due to the Chakra fruit or maybe due to their affinity to chakra.</p><p>That said, I noticed that Kuroka and Shirone can manipulate and control Chakra even better than me and I have been using Shadow Clones for a few years now.</p><p>I put in trading the senjutsu and chakra affinity from a Youkai prisoner for myself and my subordinates.</p><p>And while a little slower than those two, others picked up the skill as well. Helena taking the lead this time, surprisingly. I saw for myself why she was called the best female researcher in the entire Underworld. She had that….that look of a possessed person when she was busy in her research. The normal calm and composed girl somehow vanished as soon as she took up research and was replaced by a true mad scientist.</p><p>When I had explained to her about the Shadow Clone jutsu and its applications, she had started practicing it like a woman possessed.</p><p>Then again, it was understandable. The Shadow Clone Jutsu was basically the wet dream of every mad scientist. Several copies of yourself to do the experiments that you don’t trust others to do, perfect feedback of all that data and no injuries in case of experimental accidents. It was everything a researcher could ask for.</p><p>As for the mental load of the feedback, we are devils. We can get used to it or find ways to overcome it.</p><p>She was currently working on creating a new dimension in the Dimensional Gap. We realized that the bases in the Underworld can only carry us so much. I mean despite everything, what we were doing there was hiding from everyone. The area was still under the control of the current government. What we needed was a place of our own, a place that no one could claim any stupid legal right and use it as an excuse to declare a war.</p><p>Thus came the idea of creating a new dimension for ourselves.</p><p>The Underworld, Heaven and many other dimensions are connected to the Human world but there is the Dimensional Gap surrounding it.</p><p>The Rating Games are conducted in the temporary dimensions created in the Dimensional Gap.</p><p>The popular belief that Ophis and Great Red would attack anyone who trespasses the Dimensional Gap, the truth is very different.</p><p>They just don’t care.</p><p>It was also understandable in many ways; after all, would you kill every ant that wanders around in your entire property.</p><p>Ophis is fine as long as she is left alone.</p><p>Great Red is fine as long as he is free to do whatever he wants.</p><p>Helena was currently reading over the ancient ways of making a dimension. After all, many of these dimensions were made by someone. If it was done before, what stops us from doing it again? A new dimension will also give us a place to be free.</p><p>Gretel has been assisting her with this enterprise.</p><p>Dimension Lost can create dimensions and its Balance Breaker is known to seal things inside an unbreakable dimension of sorts.</p><p>Dimension Lost has a spirit inside it but nothing was known about it. It never talks and even the barest communications that it makes with its user is instinctual than anything vocal.</p><p>Just what kind of being was sealed inside the Dimension Lost and just what is its connection with the Dimensional Gap. This is a question that we are trying to figure out.</p><p>I gave Innovate Clear to Helena to use temporarily.</p><p>The power to create a world and life within it.</p><p>It is a combination of both Dimension Lost and Annihilation Maker because it can make both different dimensions and living creatures within it.</p><p>We are studying ways to replicate these powers.</p><p>Helena hides the presence of her Sacred Gear under several enhancements.</p><p>She has been sending her Shadow Clones to public gatherings in her place since she learned the technique and only attending a few of them herself.</p><p>I also made progress with my own Sacred Gear.</p><p>Telos Karma is a piece of art.</p><p>I tried using it with my Mad Doctor experiments.</p><p>Recreating the enhancement drugs was not hard. I even made some improvements to it. The good part came when I was checking it on the prisoners.</p><p>With the use of Telos Karma, each of those prisoners survived two doses. Above two doses, the probability became lower and the rate of survival was reduced. The probability varied from person to person.</p><p>That said I was using the weakest of the low class devils I could.</p><p>The increase was also different for each person despite surviving the same amount of drug.</p><p>A mid class devil got a higher increase in Demonic Power compared to a Low Class Devil.</p><p>A five times more increase.</p><p>To understand it in a simpler way, imagine both Rock Lee and Might Guy opening the fifth gate. Lee couldn’t even beat Gaara while Guy could smack Kisame with it.</p><p>It was the difference between basic stats. The Enhancement Drugs provided a percentage increase in strength.</p><p>Anyways, a low class devil was elevated almost to the level of a High Class within two weeks after the enhancement while a Mid Class Devil became a Peak High Class.</p><p>The problem that arose after this was that they became mentally unstable or their bodies began to slowly degrade after a few months.</p><p>Only 40% of them survived and among them only 20% were left sane.</p><p>This was not the result I was looking for.</p><p>I will need more samples of blood from other people.</p><p> I wondered if I could make a drug from the blood of a Super Devil. Would it be a lower or higher grade than the current one?</p><p>I did have my own but my blood was unusable due to the King’s Essence’s power so this route was closed.</p><p>There were other projects too.</p><p>As I was thinking about how to expand my network and influence around the world, the one I had been waiting for arrived.</p><p>A man with black hair and golden fringes, dressed in a purple yukata walked into the room.</p><p>He stared at me and I noticed his eyes widening for a moment before he controlled himself and then he burst out into a laugh “Hahahaha Damien Lucifer, I really didn’t believe him when he told me how you looked but color me surprised….half the underworld would have gone to war just looking at your face.”</p><p>….</p><p>“I am not into men.”</p><p>That cut his laughter abruptly as he spluttered.</p><p>“And neither am I, brat.”</p><p>“Your words seemed to imply otherwise.”</p><p>“….fuck, what I meant was who you look like. Do you not realize that you look hauntingly similar to Lucifer?, so much so that people would rather call you his twin than Michael?”</p><p>Huh?</p><p>THAT, I had no idea about.</p><p>“I’m afraid that I was unaware of that. There were no pictures of Lucifer I could peruse.”</p><p>“Well just look at a mirror.” He snorted before picking up a glass of whiskey and downing it in one go. “That hit the spot.” He then looked at Gretel, standing behind me. “Is she the Lucifuge girl? Greta?”</p><p>“Gretel Lucifuge, my aide.” I introduced myself as she bowed slightly.</p><p>“Lucifers and their maid fetishes.” I heard the man whisper which earned him a death glare from Gretel which he ignored.</p><p>This was the strongest Fallen Angel in history and I could sense that he was stronger than anyone else I had seen except Rizevim. He was almost twice as strong as Razevan and that is beyond a Satan Class Devil. Wasn’t he supposed to be as strong as Serafall and such? Why is he stronger? He also has the Downfall Dragon Another Armour on top of it to increase his power.</p><p>But in hindsight, this also makes sense. After all, which faction doesn’t have a trump card or two. It wouldn’t make sense if they didn’t have any back hand to at least stop a Super Devil level threat if not defeat them. They did fight in the Great War after all.</p><p>Gretel and I stand no chance against this person in a straight out fight and we can only escape with Dimension Lost if such a situation arose.</p><p>“So, Razevan told me about the change in plans. Apparently you have a few followers of your own that you would like to bunk with.”</p><p>I felt the wild fluctuation in Gretel’s emotions. She had almost collapsed when she heard the truth about Aria and Razevan. Although she didn’t need the Vritra type Sacred Gear anymore, she was still moved from the care of those two towards an orphan like her.</p><p>Too bad that Razevan had passed away a month ago….or at least that was the news circulating round. He was killed in the Old Satan Faction’s main base but not before causing more than half of it to collapse.</p><p>Euclid lost almost half of his limbs and I don’t know how but Rizevim lost an eye to the madman on a death run.</p><p>Later on Katerea informed me that he had taken in suicidal amounts of Enhancement Drugs and something else that increased his power enormously for a short period of time but at the cost of all his vitality.</p><p>Rizevim had underestimated him and paid the price for it but when he had gotten serious, Razevan stood no chance.</p><p>The good news is that while he had caused chaos in the base, Katerea and Ophelia had taken the opportunity to free some of the high profile war captives from the main base. This included several of the 72 Pillar Devils who were thought to have died in the Great War and the Civil War. They also emptied the research base for valuable materials.</p><p>That is mainly what we were using for our research.</p><p>She informed me that Euclid was planning to conduct an experiment on a very special test subject but she couldn’t find out who that was.</p><p>I had an idea but there was no way to bring the test subject – Lilith out. No one knew where Lilith was at the moment.</p><p>Too bad Euclid somehow survived the ordeal. That said more than two dozen Ultimate Class Devils had died in the fight.</p><p>I pushed the thoughts out of my head and concentrated on the conversation. “I feel more comfortable with them.”</p><p>He raised both his hands, “Hey, whatever’s good for you. In any case I have already gotten the payment and I owe Razevan so I will help you out at a later date if you need. That said, I have heard that he managed to collect some good specimens. I was wondering if I could trade them for something.”</p><p>“Sorry, those have already been used by my people. I don’t have the habit of trading my people.”</p><p>“I’d be fine for a chance to study the Sacred Gears alone. I could provide you with anything you need from me in return.” He continued.</p><p>“What are you studying?”</p><p>“Hmm let’s see. I am trying to create Sacred Gears of my own. It is obviously much harder than one might think. Centuries of work and I can only make some half-baked ones. My current biggest project is to create a Draconic Type Sacred Gear so I was wondering if I could study the Divine Dividing. I assure you that no harm will be caused to Razevan’s Daughter obviously.” He added the last part when Gretel’s demonic power leaked slightly at Vienna’s mention.</p><p>“I will have to ask her about it but it will not be without one of us supervising and not in the next two years. She needs her own training.”</p><p>“I can help her master her Sacred Gear if you want.” He offered.</p><p>I did sense that he wanted to study the Divine Dividing but he had no intention of actually harming Vienna. The Prince of Lies makes it almost impossible for people to hide from me. On second thought, Razevan being the true user of The Prince of Lies still wanted to entrust Vienna to this person and should have already given me the answer about his intentions. Azazel had no intentions of any harm towards us.</p><p>“I want her to study some of the basics first before making her concentrate on her Sacred Gear. Albion agrees with my training method as well.”</p><p>“Oh, The White One agrees. Now that is a surprise. The Heavenly Dragons are usually too aloof to talk to anyone but their hosts but from your words it seems that you have a good relationship with him.”</p><p>“He has lived a long life and has many valuable experiences that I can learn from. I like talking to him when I can.”</p><p>“No no, the surprising part is him talking back. So any experience you want to share?”</p><p>“He seems to hate your father second only to Ddraig.”</p><p>“Ahahahaha that is a funny piece of information. There are many who do the same though.”</p><p>The talks were interrupted by the waiter knocking and bringing some food in for us.</p><p>“So what made you think of inviting us to….this place for a meeting?” Gretel had been on edge since we entered the place and I somehow couldn’t find words to soothe her either.</p><p>“What! You don’t like the Oppai Club the members of Grigori have set up? I dare say it is one of the most successful businesses in the country.”</p><p>“Using lust based Fallen Angel to indulge in their habits and earn money as well as make connections among the upper class society people that come here is indeed a brilliant idea. What I was asking is why did you call a twelve and half year old to <em>this</em> place?”</p><p>“Eh, details aside, you <em>are</em> kinda my nephew. I was just doing my part as the cool uncle showing you fun things to do. Father knows what Lucifer did to raise Rizevim to make him the way he is? I’d rather you steal girlfriends and wives from humans than their souls like my brother dearest had been preaching back then. In that way Razevan was much better than both his father and grandfather. One of the reasons I got on so well with him.”</p><p>I looked at the man in front of me and surprisingly…..<em>extremely</em> surprisingly….there was no lie in that statement.</p><p> “You really like humans, don’t you?” I asked curious. All the knowledge I have about this….this ancient being, someone who is older than all the devils currently in existence, came from the light novels and anime, that I have learned first-hand not to rely on at all or from the mouths of other people.</p><p>“Of course I do. I was thrown down because I taught them some fun things to do. Apparently my father didn’t like my enthusiasm. It is too early, he said.”</p><p>“I heard you slept with a human woman and that got you kicked out.”</p><p>The man almost choked. “Hey, I was teaching her that not everything comes free. If she wanted beauty products, she had to pay for them. Teaching people to work to earn their keep, isn’t that good stuff?”</p><p>I sensed some inconsistencies in his words and called him out for it. “You loved her.”</p><p>His eyes widened slightly, and he recovered so quickly that it might as well have been a mirage. “Obviously I liked her. Why would I sleep with someone I don’t like?”</p><p>“You <em>loved</em> her.”</p><p>“Hah? Me? I am Azazel, the Angel of Playboys. My love cannot be reserved for a single woman.”</p><p>Lie.</p><p>“Is that why you don’t have a single child in all your life of sleeping around?”</p><p>He winced. “We have too low fertility rates.”</p><p>“I can sense when you lie.”</p><p>I saw his mouth hanging open. “T-that’s Razevan’s Trait.”</p><p>“It is.”</p><p>“<em>sigh</em> That brat left this as a surprise for me. Say, how about you forget that bit just now. It just doesn’t go with the image.”</p><p>“You mean all that ‘Angel of the Playboys’ image.”</p><p>“Yes yes that one.”</p><p>“Hmm sure, why not.” I smirked. “You owe me one”</p><p>This is probably the best conversation I have had with a male in this whole world. The men in my base all call me boss and are a bit reserved.</p><p>Desmond and the members of Cleria’s Peerage are also similar.</p><p>“Heh, a devil through and through.”</p><p>I merely raised my glass towards him.</p><p>“So, can we get to the main topic for today?”</p><p>He straightened up. “You said that you wanted to cooperate with the Fallen Angels through me while hiding your identities.” I nodded. “With what?”</p><p>“Information, resources, jobs that you might find difficult to do with your people among other things.”</p><p>Money.</p><p>Funding and influences with Alicia’s and Ophelia’s companies alone wouldn’t cut it for our needs. For the initial period, my people would need more, much more funds to establish ourselves, expand and gain more people.</p><p>I couldn’t let both Alicia and Ophelia become the center of attention if they tried to expand. They would immediately be contained and shut down by both the Current Satan Faction and the Great King Faction when they find out about it.</p><p>Those two factions almost always keep fighting with each other but wouldn’t hesitate for a single moment to cooperate and crush a third force from making a foothold in the Underworld.</p><p>Every move made between the members of these two factions is because of this.</p><p>From the recent news it seems that Sirzechs has had a child named Milicas. This has sent out some murmurs about the next Gremory Heir.</p><p>The traditionalists don’t want Millicas to become the heir because that would mean that the future House Gremory would be in control of the New Satan Faction completely. There is also a fact that boys can easily have more children with harems whereas girls would be restricted and thus preventing the house from having more members, restricting its power.</p><p>The House of Gremory is already strong enough to be a threat in the eyes of the Great King Faction.</p><p>Zeoticus with his connection to Zekram via Venelana at least maintains a mirage of ties with the Great King Faction and they don’t want that to be broken.</p><p>This in turn puts a lot of pressure on the current heiress, Rias.</p><p>Zeoticus has been talking about arranging an arranged marriage of Rias with the House of Phenex, the so called richest house in the Underworld to provide her with enough backing to fend off the future pressure as well as any puppets sent by the Great King Faction to take Rias’ hands and gain control over the house.</p><p>The cooperation of two of the biggest houses of the Underworld would make a power base that wouldn’t be trifled with easily. The children part was just an excuse for it.</p><p>There is another girl in a similar position, Sona Sitri. She is currently engaged to a puppet of the Great King faction.</p><p>I have heard through the grapevine that they wanted to make the engagement binding but Serafall had personally visited the other party and that decision had been held off. Ophelia later confirmed that to be true.</p><p>The Sitri are the biggest medical service providers in the Underworld with their services being used by other territories just as much as their own.</p><p>Phenex Tears, while marvelous in their effect, were not able to cure sickness, only injuries and physical and mental exhaustion.</p><p>This made the services of the Sitri that much more valuable.</p><p>Demonic Power is very chaotic and thus healing powers are almost non-existent among Devils.</p><p>The sleeping method only works as the user circulates their demonic power to the other party to mend their wounds. It does nothing for sickness either.</p><p>This is where the Sitri’s command over water magic comes into play. Water Magic is second only to Holy Magic and Senjutsu for healing and even then Holy magic cannot be used to heal Devils. Previously the followers of the Original Leviathan were almost always well versed in water magic. Houses like Vepar, Halphas and others. Now among them, only the Sitri are financially well enough to maintain such business. One has to wonder how all the other houses were so conveniently bankrupted. Yes, bankrupted. There are still three such houses left but they cannot maintain their households anymore.</p><p>These kinds of power plays were pretty common among the people of the Underworld.</p><p>Now if such things happen so regularly inside a faction, one can already imagine what happens between two different factions.</p><p>Thus Azazel’s reaction to my offer had been completely expected and actually more on the good side.</p><p>He kept staring at me and I knew that I had to throw in something here. He was the leader of an entire faction and I was a twelve and a half year old runaway with two factions and potentially three Super Devil's chasing behind me. Why should he cooperate with us?</p><p>“I have some prisoners to exchange with you. Prisoners from the Great War thought to be dead.”</p><p>Now that got his interest.</p><p>“They were locked away in the main base of the Old Satan Faction and I made it a point to retrieve them when the chaos with Razevan was happening. Not all of them wish to join you though so my apologies for not trading them back.”</p><p>“Names. I want a list of names and your price.”</p><p>I handed them a note with all the names on it. The highlight would probably be the name of the son of Penemue, another eight winged Fallen Angel who was thought to be dead two hundred years ago.</p><p>“The price will be – connections. I want your connections to other factions. The Youkai, the Norse, the Shinto, the Celtics, etc.”</p><p>“You want me to give my millennia long connections to you through a backdoor and also help you to hide your ass.” I nodded pretty confidently about this one. That list had some pretty high profile names. “Tch, you have that annoying pride of Lucifer too. Any one faction, choose.” He replied, still looking at the list.</p><p>“Two and you give me information about potential recruits, Sacred Gear users, talented fighters and magicians and Hero Descendants.”</p><p>“One and I will give you information about potential recruits without any Sacred Gears and you allow me to study any Sacred Gears that you get your hands on.”</p><p>“ Agreed but not all Sacred Gears.” I didn’t expect Azazel to tell me about Sacred Gear users to begin with. That’s his hobby after all. It was just added to be haggled down. “The Norse.” I answered after a moment of thought. I can get the connection among the Youkai through Kuroka and the Shinto from the Youkai.</p><p>The Celts have declined a lot. The Greeks have a mile long stick up their asses.</p><p>The Hindu Pantheon is too dangerous and like to keep to themselves.</p><p>The only reasonable choice was the Norse.</p><p>He took a few minutes to look over the list and kept it down with a sigh resting his face in his palm.</p><p>“You said there were a few that didn’t want to join us anymore. Can you tell me their names?”</p><p>“….some of them have their privacy that I respect but I can give you an example.” He raised an eyebrow and continued. “Celine, the daughter of Uriel.”</p><p>I saw his eyes widening and a hint of guilt in them. “We thought she was dead. She….”</p><p>“Was captured and abused for over four hundred years until she was merely a shell of her former self. She didn’t have any sense at all when I met her, like a soulless body. She is currently under rehab trying to regain her senses. She didn’t want to have anything to do with the Fallen Angels.” I saw him lowering his head and asked. “Who was it?”</p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p>“Who was behind that attack? The incident didn’t seem to be your style at all.”</p><p>“Obviously. I had fought wars against the Angels but I never gave commands for people to rape them. My problem was with Father. To be honest, after a few centuries, I didn’t care. The life of a Fallen was good….much more suitable to me. For good or for bad they are all my siblings or nephews and nieces. I attacked them to save my people but THAT….that was something I would never allow.”</p><p>“However….”</p><p>“….there are some people in the Grigori who bear too much hate for the angels and heaven to do something like that. It was wartime and I couldn’t control all of them. I know I have made some decisions that were brutal but that was the Governor General of Grigori leading his troops but even I had lines I do not cross.”</p><p>No lie.</p><p>But thinking about it, Azazel was the first one to pull out of the War. It earned him the ire of many of the Grigori members but he held his ground and as a result, the fallen were the ones who suffered the least in the Great War….well relatively.</p><p>“Who was behind the attack?” I asked again.</p><p>“I can’t tell you.”</p><p>He won’t tell me.</p><p>So he is still in the Grigori.</p><p>He is someone relatively higher up so Azazel wouldn’t give up on him even with all this.</p><p>That higher up the command chain in Grigori can only be a Cadre.</p><p>Semhazai is not the type.</p><p>Penemue actually fell because of the incident herself when she chased after Celine, dissatisfied with the decision of Heaven and losing trust in her father. Kokabiel would rather kill than do such a thing. Barakiel was not the type either. The ones left are Sataneel, Amaros, Arakiel, Asmodel, Gadreel and Tamiel.</p><p>The others are not people who would survive this kind of a thing.</p><p>“Okay.” I can find that myself.</p><p>….</p><p>….</p><p>“What? Just that? No arguments, no persuasions?”</p><p>“No. Any information you give me now won’t be something I would trust.”</p><p>“Not holding back anything eh.” He took another sip from his glass while I ate the food in front of me. “Fine. I will send the information about the potential recruits to you. As for the Norse, wait for a few years. Deals are made between people of similar strengths. Weak ones can only submit or die. Get stronger. Be in a position where you can use the connections I offer you. Right now talking to Odin will only be suicidal to you. I had heard from Razevan about the two of you. A decade or so and you three can easily be a Leader Class and then you will have enough backing to negotiate with a major faction like the Norse.”</p><p>Reasonable.</p><p>As for him backing out….that was never the matter anyways.</p><p>I thought over it for a bit and nodded.</p><p>“So, when can I meet them?”</p><p>“Hmm, I will send you the address at a later date.”</p><p>“Fair enough.”</p><p>We discussed more things after that. He told me some stories from his time in Heaven and that’s when I asked him about something I had been trying to search for a long while.</p><p>“Can you tell me something about Lucifer?”</p><p>“Interested in the good old’ Dad' eh? Sure.” He poured himself another glass before leaning back on his seat. “Lucifer or rather Helel was the first of the two angels created by Father, his dearest son.” I raised an eyebrow and he chuckled. “Father valued him because he was the only one who didn’t agree to everything Father said readily and actually questioned. The ability to think is very precious is what he used to say. He was the most brilliant of all angels. Charismatic, talented and strong, always the center of attention and always the first to do any work. He loved his siblings more than anything. Compared to it Michael was a jealous middle child. He has grown up a lot since then.” He took a sip as a hint of nostalgia seeped into his voice.</p><p>“You seem to respect him a lot.”</p><p>“I did.”</p><p>“You don’t anymore?” I asked intrigued.</p><p>“Helel, yes. Lucifer….I don’t know.”</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>“The more someone loves something, the more they can get hurt by it. Helel….he loved father, adored the very ground he walked on. That’s why when He started working on humans, Lucifer didn’t say anything. He carried on with his job. But with time, he started questioning Father's decision about the <em>unworthy</em> humans. Why should my siblings act as chauffeurs for them? He desperately tried to show everyone the faults of humans and how they were sinful and not worthy of Father’s love. Say what you will about the Old man but he was stubborn but so was Helel. Something happened. I don’t know what but Helel had left Heaven with Lilith. Father never told us what had happened and we only knew that Helel rebelled. Yes, all of us fell but he was the only one who rebelled. Of all the angels who went against Father, Helel was the only one who was not thrown out of Heaven. He left voluntarily.”</p><p>Now THAT was something I didn’t know.</p><p>This world’s Christianity is not the same as what I had known so I had no idea what to think.</p><p>“The next time I saw Helel, he called himself Lucifer. His magnificent wings had lost their feathers and looked like that of bats and his magic corrupted. I won’t lie but that was the first time I felt fear. I had fought against Gods of other Pantheons when under Father and had seen Father at his full power, not weakened when he was in the Great War and still….that day Lucifer….scared me.” His voice seemed a little hollow. “The brother I knew had changed. Didn’t fall but had become something else entirely. He had completely rejected Father’s powers. It seemed as if he was the antithesis of everything Father stood for and fallen I might have, I still had the power of light. I felt instinctively revolted. There was insanity in his eyes unlike anything I had seen before.”</p><p>He took a deep breath and continued.</p><p>“To truly hate someone, you have to love them just that deeply. After all, have you seen people hating random strangers with all their beings? He still had his charisma. He got together allies and created an entire Race, a feat rivaling Father but….that caring person whom we knew had turned into a proud tyrant. So yes, while I loved and respected Helel, Lucifer was another story. If I didn’t know better, I wouldn’t even believe that those two were ever the same.”</p><p>The atmosphere quieted down after that.</p><p>Azazel didn’t seem to be in a mood to speak anything else and I didn’t force him either.</p><p>I had asked him about Lucifer to know more about his myth in this world to find a clue about my Lucifer House Trait, if I had any. Till now, I had no idea what it was.</p><p>The Prince of Lies was from Razevan and I was pretty sure I didn’t have that ability and same was the case for ‘The Denial of the Divine’. So I had to have something else that Lucifer was known for. I had thought that I might get a clue if I asked Azazel. After all he was someone who knew Lucifer from even before the Devil Race was created.</p><p>We left after finalizing some other matters.</p><p><strong>- Scene Change –</strong></p><p>I walked into the meeting room, Gretel following me.</p><p>Vi was playing with Shirone who had come to visit.</p><p>Cleria was there with some other members.</p><p>I took the seat at the forefront of the table as Gretel stood behind me.</p><p>“How was the meeting, Master?” Cleria asked.</p><p>“It was satisfactory. Azazel seemed amiable enough.”</p><p>“He might seem like it but that is the most cunning of the Fallen Angels. I wouldn’t be surprised if he had cards hidden as well.” Ophelia commented.</p><p>“I never expected anything less. We got a decent deal. Here is the list of some potential recruits. Check them and see if they can be recruited.” I handed the list to Ophelia.</p><p> “I don’t understand something, Young Lord.” Lavinia asked. Lavinia was….well an airhead. She was never afraid of asking or doing things or rather it would be better to say that she lacked common sense. I think Glenda didn’t care about her common sense and general knowledge at all.</p><p>She had once entered my bedroom and cuddled Vienna who was sleeping with me. When I woke her up, her words were, ‘Are, why are you in my room Young Lord. Do you need hugs for sleep?’ and then she proceeded to hug Vienna and me to sleep. I was too tired that day during training and didn’t even bother saying anything.</p><p>The main problem had been when Gretel had come to wake us up the next day. She was furious but was pulled into the bed by a sleepy Lavinia whom she was trying to scold.</p><p>She had been a little hostile to the airhead but was slowly won over by Lavinia’s simple and pure-hearted nature.</p><p>Nowadays she treats her like a younger sister even though Lavinia was the older one.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Why are you sending the Fallen Angels away? There are so many good people in them. We could have been friends.”</p><p>Ah.</p><p>“I have to say that this is something even I had doubts about. They mightstand up against us, after all they were captured by Devils and tortured for years. It wouldn't be surprising if they wanted to take revenge. They could also make the other Fallen take actions against us.” Victoria spoke up, albeit meekly.</p><p>“You didn’t understand either, Victoria? Well then let me explain to you. Each one of them had to sign a loyalty contract to me. The contract states that they will work normally and live their lives in the Grigori but their ultimate loyalty will lie with me. They are my sleeper cells inside the Grigori in case we stand on different sides in the future. Some of them will make other spies for me inside the Grigori.”</p><p>“So the ones who didn’t want to leave?”</p><p>“Haven’t signed the contracts yet. If they don’t be of use then I can only make sure that they end up as a way to increase Celine’s powers.”</p><p>This was my goal from the very start. This is why I didn’t insist when Azazel lowered the number of factions to one because my goal from the very start was not his connections….but to make my spies gain entry inside the Grigori without being suspicious.</p><p>Now, although they will be suspicious, they will monitor these people but will find no anomalies. Moreover their release was due to a reason so Azazel himself will cover for them.</p><p>Azazel, as good as he might be, was still the leader of a faction. If there ever came a time where the profits of Grigori and my safety clashed, he would stand against me in a heartbeat.</p><p>That is why I had to make sure to infiltrate the organization. These released prisoners will do nothing odd or betray Grigori….that is unless Grigori acts against me.</p><p>“I will send some people to recruit them.” Ophelia said after looking at the list.</p><p>“Observe them first. Don’t make your presence known. Azazel might have put similar people in position to insert his own spies among us. It won’t work but it’s still good to be cautious. Anything else?”</p><p>“I am sorry to inform you Master but our funding cannot sustain all of our projects without attracting the attention of others. Currently most of the funds come from me and Alicia. A part of it comes from Helena’s patents and some from Diehauser Belial helping Cleria. Most of our forces are recruited from the Old Satan Faction and stray devils and thus cannot roam around freely which restrains our use of our manpower severely. We need some other ways of earning money. I apologise for our incompetence.” Ophelia informed me.</p><p>Her incompetence?</p><p>No.</p><p>The reason for this is my urgency.</p><p>I never realized this in the Old Satan Faction because I used to get whatever I wanted there. What with me being a child and the ‘Young Lord’. Here however we needed more money.</p><p>I had made it a point to keep Ophelia and Alicia funding me a secret but the construction of the new bases, the research, the widespread search for Sacred Gear users and even arming the armies for the raids….have all taken a ridiculous amount of money.</p><p>They didn’t inform me of this earlier because it was somewhat shameful for them and a bit because I was already busy with trying to escape the Old Satan Faction.</p><p>Now however our spending is bordering on a line from where the shifts in funds can be noticed by everyone.</p><p>Now, how to raise money?</p><p>I closed my eyes and thought of a few plans.</p><p>“If I remember correctly, Alicia has a firm grip on the entertainment industry, right?”</p><p>“Yes Master.”</p><p>“Does that include the Human World?”</p><p>“I do have some industries dealing in the human world as well.”</p><p>“Which industries do you focus on, Ophelia?”</p><p>“Mainly construction.”</p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p>Construction and Entertainment.</p><p>I wonder if I can plagiarize the manga and anime from my previous life. I don’t want to draw manga on my own but I can use illusions to show them to others from my memory and they can recreate it. The Mind Palace technique does give me an exceptional memory. I can recall almost all the plots perfectly.</p><p>“Do you have any reach in the Manga and Animation industry?” I asked Alicia.</p><p>“Not directly. I do have acquaintances that do.”</p><p>“Buy a small studio. Hire mangaka and animators. I will send you the recordings for the plot. See if it works. If it does, then continue. If not then drop it. It will be a small project.”</p><p>The entertainment in this world is shit.</p><p>Drag-so-ball.</p><p>I was tempted to burn the TV with my Blue Flames.</p><p>I mean if Serafall Leviathan’s show was a superhit in the underworld, it has got to say something about the stupidity that this world’s entertainment is.</p><p>“The major project will be other industries. We cannot start medical industries in the underworld without stepping on the Sitri’s and Phenex’s toes. The only way would be if we make a contract with one of these two. I’ll let you pick. In the meanwhile, Helena and I will try to make some medicines for humans to use. The Human world is much better for such kinds of things. Start a Pharmaceutical Company in the Human world.”</p><p>Alicia nodded.</p><p>With Helena and me working together with the Mad Doctor Essence, we could make a top rated Pharmaceutical Company in the Human World.</p><p>Later on, this industry can be spread in the territories of my subordinates on a lower scale. In the meantime if we can make a contract with any of those two houses, preferably with the Sitri, we will spread the industry through them.</p><p>“Ophelia.”</p><p>“Yes Master.”</p><p>“What about the agriculture and plantation industries?”</p><p>“There are no major industries for these things. Lords of various territories can simply buy it from others. It is only the lower class Devil who participate in such things and they have to pay taxes to the Lords. There are small factories but nothing too extravagant.”</p><p>“Oh? Why is that so? With so much area in the underworld and so little population, I would have thought that they would be farming huge areas to make profits.”</p><p>“It is not that anyone hasn’t tried it but the Underworld has had too many wars. These wars have left a majority of the land uncultivable due to the blood of extremely strong beings corrupting the places. Even three quarters of my own lands are like that. Thankfully the lands we have under our control are much larger than other Pillar Houses so we can make do with it. Because of these reasons, the farming part is not possible in most of the lands and where it is possible, it is more difficult. Water is not that easily available in all parts of the Underworld making it difficult to do agriculture. The main source of water in such places is magic and low class devils can only use so much of it. No High Class Devil would waste their time in agriculture now, would they?”</p><p>“Yes. I have heard that before the Great War, the Original Leviathan would use her Sea Serpent of the End to form massive water bodies in different parts of the Underworld. This would help the people of the Underworld grow their crops. Now however, no one does such a thing. Serafall would put the land in permafrost if she tried such a thing.”</p><p>Apparently seeing my bewildered look from Helena’s information, Ophelia continued. “While it might seem that Lucifer and the other three Satans had an easy time establishing the Devil Race in the Underworld, it was not so. The Underworld was a barren place at the start. It took a lot of effort from all the four Satans to make it habitable. While Beelzebub is known as the King of Flies and is known to bring ruin to crops, he could also control worms to tilt lands and make them more suitable for cultivation. Leviathan alone has created more water bodies in the Underworld than there are cities. They might have had their faults but there is a reason why even the Current Satans have to use their names to rule. They literally used their blood and sweat to create the Devil Race. The general population is also long lived and thus the Current Government cannot just vilify and bury the deeds of the Original Satans like they normally do in the Human World.”</p><p>Villains of one place, heroes of another.</p><p>Watching a story from a different perspective really does show us different things.</p><p>“Is there any way to reclaim the corrupted lands?” I asked.</p><p>“Hmm, there might be one but it is too difficult to try.”</p><p>“Oh!?”</p><p>“The Youkai and Spirits of the Land can use Senjutsu to purify the land without the use of light or holy magic. They can also enhance crop growth exponentially. It is just that, getting help from the Youkai is near impossible.”</p><p>The Youkai.</p><p>Kuroka is too young to use her to make a connection with the Youkai.</p><p>It seems I will have to make some moves myself.</p><p>“The Naberius. Have you found out any information about them? Any Youkai among any of their peerages?”</p><p>They looked slightly weirdly at me but continued nonetheless. “There has been news of a pair of twin Kitsunes in the peerage of a Branch House member of the Naberius. They are around thirteen years old and are doing very well in the lower leveled Rating Games. Both Brother and Sister are very talented in Senjutsu and might even rival Kuroka without your mark.”</p><p>So they did start the experiment.</p><p>I will have to find a way to get an insider in that place.</p><p>I need to find a way to use this incident to profit as much as possible.</p><p>A Kitsune twin pair.</p><p>“How many tails do they have?”</p><p>“Four.”</p><p>Not bad.</p><p>While not a Nekoshou, their talents will not be behind either.</p><p>“The Naberius are conducting experiments on those two and possibly more Youkai. Find a way to get an insider among them.”</p><p>“Experiments?”</p><p>“To use Senjutsu to create a Super Devil. I have no idea what they have in mind but they might be related to Shalba and the Old Satan Faction. Find and talk to Katerea if possible and see if you can find any information about them.”</p><p>Until the connections with the Youkai can be made, the land cannot be reclaimed. Or is there any other way?</p><p>I thought about it and a certain power came to my mind.</p><p>Growing plants and absorbing Demonic chakra – Mokuton.</p><p>If Hashirama Senju knew that his famed power was being planned to be used in this way, on a second though Hashirama would have been happy about it. Madara would have burned everything to cinders.</p><p>Can Mokuton be used?</p><p>It is a highly valuable power to use.</p><p>Even the ingredients for our research and medicines will need to be grown.</p><p>I am pretty sure I can recreate that power or one of my marked subordinates can. Probably Kuroka. Maybe some other additions as well.</p><p>She did have talents in Chakra and Senjutsu to fully use the power of Mokuton.</p><p>This is however a long term plan.</p><p>“Alicia, Ophelia, try to recruit the members of the pillar houses that have become broke and lost their nobility. They might have lost their nobility but they haven’t lost their blood. They are still more talented than the normal low and mid class Devils. If they join and sign contracts, inject them with the Enhancement Drug and employ them in your peerage. Do you have any peerage members who have their own Evil Pieces?”</p><p>“My peerage members are all over two hundred years old, Master. All of them are High Class Devils.”</p><p>“Same for me. All of my household members are High Class Devils.”</p><p>“Fill their Peerages with the talented members. Keep the top members out however. The Pharmaceutical Business we will be making will serve as a double as a way for making Deals. Deals with the rich and the influential people of the Human world. Businessmen, Sportsmen, Politicians, target them. We will be selling some drugs that are unavailable to humans. Drugs like Cancer Suppressants. Not cures. No. Employ a method of dividing our memberships in different levels, for example Cancer Suppressants will be in level two for which they will have to make 100 Deals with us to unlock, Anti-aging medicines will be for level for which they will have to make 10,000 deals with us unlock. We will use only mundane materials so no supernatural factions will be able to do anything to us. This method has a legal loophole that no one can blame. It will help your peerages to qualify for Mid Class and High Class level promotions very quickly without having to show their strengths in the Rating Games.”</p><p>“No joke Master but you sound like a Black Hearted businessman.” Charlene joked. She had a very lively personality with her friends.</p><p>“I am the Devil. What else did you expect?”</p><p>“It will attract the attention of the Current Government and the Old Devils. They will not like others gaining powers so quickly.” Ophelia commented.</p><p>“Don’t worry. By the time we start this business, they will be too busy putting out the fires in their own houses.”</p><p>I sat back thinking about what needs to be done.</p><p><strong>- Azazel –</strong></p><p>Azazel sat in his private room. There were two other occupants.</p><p>The Vice Governor of Grigori, Shemhazai and Penemue, the latter having tears in her eyes as she drank from the glass of whiskey.</p><p>“You wouldn’t believe me till you saw him for yourself. He looked like a mini Helel. I thought for a moment that he was trying to pull a prank on me but apparently he didn’t even know how Lucifer looked.”</p><p>“Hehehehe I wonder what Heaven and the Devils will think when he reveals himself?” Semhazai laughed in amusement.</p><p>“Michael will probably have a heart attack.” Azazel joined in.</p><p>It was the only woman in the room who joined the conversation then. “You said Helel. Helel not Lucifer.”</p><p>Semhazai quieted down when he realized the words and looked pointedly at Azazel.</p><p>“He….he reminded me of Helel. Something of both him and Lucifer mixed in. I would never imagine holding such a civil conversation with Lucifer for Father’s  sake. The boy….the boy was a bit like….him. The him before he became….that.”</p><p>“Oh, how was he?” Semhazai asked, finding it rare for Azazel to be using these words. Helel had been a complicated topic for every Biblical Faction for different reasons.</p><p>“Apart from the looks, he had that charisma but then again Devils had that too. There was something, I don’t know, something familiar that reminded me of him when I looked at the boy. He was calm. Sure he was wary of me and had kept some guards in a mirror dimension to protect him. Ah that reminds me, they have the Dimensional Lost user.” Azazel threw in the bomb in between the conversation stunning the two easily but continuing the conversation without bothering with their reactions. “He had power too. A Satan Class Devil without even entering his teenage years.” Another bomb was thrown. “It was just the way he managed himself. There was a certain calmness containing the insanity that Lucifers generally have. He seemed more….more balanced in a weird sort of way. Just an instinct. I told him stories about the old days and he listened to everything attentively and had more emotions, no matter how much he tried to control them, than I would ever see in any Lucifer. Knowing what the boy has been through, I expected him to be a ball of angst waiting to burst but he was far more collected for his age. I saw how the Lucifuge girl was relying on him and him supporting her. It was in their body language. Lucifer would never allow that. No. That was a quality of Helel, something Lucifer would never show.”</p><p>“Is that why you agreed to share your connections, even an important one as the Norse with him?”</p><p>“The fact that he asked for the connections is what makes me more attracted to him. Alliances and friendships were not something Lucifer would ever make. In this aspect, he was better than even Helel. Helel was a daddy’s boy and never saw anyone worthy to be allied with Father. Lucifer on the other hand never saw anyone worthy of their Devil race. Damien however is more accepting in these areas.”</p><p>“What are you planning Azazel?” Semhazai asked, looking into the eyes of his longtime brother. “You know how much of a shit storm the boy can cause with just his presence. Isn’t that why there are only three of us in this room and not every cadre? They will not care whether he is like Helel or Lucifer. They will demand for blood. And that is not even considering the Devils. Both the new Satans and the Old Satans will be after him just because of his identity. I hope you know what you are doing here.”</p><p>Azazel simply looked into the sky outside the window.</p><p>“Call it a hunch, brother but I know that Damien Lucifer will change the world. For better or for worse remains to be seen, but he will. And when he does so, I want to see what the new world will look like.”</p><p>Semhazai quieted down while Penemue took this opportunity to speak.</p><p>“I don’t care about your hunches Azazel but this boy has saved my son and brought my niece, my student Celine out of that hellhole. For this alone I agree to support him. If it hadn’t been for you, I’d have torn off Sataneel’s head centuries ago but now knowing what Celine had gone through, I am rethinking my decision. He has been moving suspiciously nowadays. Keep a watch on him. If he does go stray though….”</p><p>None of the other two required any more words about what would happen. ‘Hell hath no wrath’ was true for all races. The Fallen Angels were no exceptions.</p><p>Unlike what most would believe, Penemue had fallen from Rage, rather than Lust.</p><p>_________________________________x__________________________________________________________________x_________________________________</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Beta Reader: LuluViBritania(FF.N, SB and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p><p><strong>Wow, this chapter took very long.</strong></p><p><strong>I was trying to make an outline for the plot of this arc. Something to work on as a frame of reference. I want this story to have less plot holes. God helps because DxD would give a fucking seive a complex about the number of holes it has.</strong></p><p><strong>This planning took more time than I was expecting.</strong></p><p><strong>I will be concentrating on the characters that Damien has recruited, fleshing them out more in this arc. I will also be adding some new characters as well. Not all OCs.</strong></p><p><strong>DxD is a BIG world. It is illogical to think that only the so called canon characters have value in such a world.</strong></p><p><strong>I will be posting a chapter containing the information about the OCs soon.</strong></p><p><strong>Now, a few things happened in this chapter.</strong></p><p><strong>Razevan went full Rambo on the Old Satan Faction.</strong></p><p><strong>Too bad he didn’t have the plot armor of Sylvester Stallone to get through that alive.</strong></p><p><strong>He did take out Rizevim’s eye and Euclid’s limbs.</strong></p><p><strong>As for Azazel’s personality. Azazel was shown caring for Vali even after being betrayed. He worked to help Vali be adopted by Odin and recognized as a free man in the Underworld.</strong></p><p><strong>That goes to show that Azazel genuinely cares. I just tried to flumble around to explore this aspect of his personality.</strong></p><p><strong>The talks about Lucifer and Helel and the Satans in their early days and what they did for the Underworld was done to carve out the world in more detail.</strong></p><p><strong>DxD’s Christainity and ours are very different. We cannot assume that there is no change in the world due to this.</strong></p><p><strong>As for the financial aspect of the organization. Remember that Alicia and Ophelia have been using secret funds to support Damien. The same is the case for his other subordinates. It is to hide his organization and the full size of it. (Azazel only knows that he has some people. Not how many. He thinks that Damien is recruiting people.). This has restricted Damien in several ways.</strong></p><p><strong>He has to think of ways to get money and wade through the political mess that the supernatural world is. I know some will say that Telos Karma can make money easily but Damien needs a sustainable long term solution and not winning a lottery a few times.</strong></p><p><strong>I hope you like the next arc.</strong></p><p><strong>Enjoy the new chapter.</strong></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.<br><br></strong></p><p> </p><p> </p><p><br></p>",

    "title": "The Deal: Chapter 10 : Breaking the Shackles",
    "content": "<p><strong>Disclaimer : I own nothing.</strong></p><p><strong>Chapter 10 : Breaking the Shackles.</strong></p><p><strong>- Damien–</strong></p><p>I watched as the crowd clamored behind me.</p><p>My Shadow Clone is in the room with Gretel while Cleria is hiding and keeping watch.</p><p>I have no idea how many people were bound just now so a little drama was needed.</p><p> I kept an eye on the gate and soon got the signal.</p><p>“So are you people ready to follow me to the battle?” I raised my voice and a slight use of magic carried it off to the rest of the crowd.</p><p>“YESSSS!.” The crowd roared.</p><p>“Then,” I turned back, my Observation Haki spread, “<strong><em>KNEEL</em></strong>.”</p><p>Almost 90% of the crowd kneeled as if their bodies were controlled by a remote while the clueless ten percent remained standing.</p><p>A blast of Conqueror’s Haki stunned the ones standing, making all of them collapse suddenly.</p><p>I turned back and looked at the crowd, “Please arrest the ones who were standing.”</p><p>That they were standing only means that they didn’t agree to the deal. There are only two ways for them from here on. One is to submit and two is….to die.</p><p>While two hundred mid class devils can be a large number, if they don’t sign the contracts, I will have no choice but to kill them. There is a high chance that some of the people can easily leak information to the higher ups of the Old Satan Faction and that would be a pain to deal with.</p><p>It didn’t even take a full minute as eighteen hundred vs two hundred surprised and stunned people was not even a fight.</p><p>I looked towards Desmond who had entered the barrier earlier. “Search the entire area and capture anyone who has escaped the search.”</p><p>“Yes Master.”</p><p>I left the rest in the care of the other attacking forces as I walked towards the room where Cleria was guarding my Shadow Clone.</p><p>This fight had truly been much better that I had expected in all my calculations. 90% of people being subdued by a single speech is not something I had expected. The best case scenario was 70%.</p><p>In that case there would have been a decent resistance….assuming that any of them withstood my Conqueror’s Haki.</p><p>Well it’s good for me I guess. Time to take care of the last problem</p><p><strong>- Clone Pov-</strong></p><p>The door of the room opened and Gregory Bune entered the room. So it was him and not Lord Paimon.</p><p>Ophelia is among the crowd. She seems to have already decided the fate of Lord Paimon in her mind.</p><p>“Gretel, the Young Lord needs your help outside. The enemy side has more Ultimate Class Devils than us and two of them also have Longinus. I don’t think the Young Lord can hold on all on his own. You are well versed in Space Magic and can be of much better help to the Young Lord against the Dimension Lost than someone like me. Support the Young Lord and leave the barrier to me.”</p><p>A reasonable statement albeit a little exaggerated.</p><p>A barely teenage devil, no matter how talented, holding against an Ultimate Class Devil with one of the Top level Longinus is impossible, let alone two at the same time.</p><p>It can easily be seen that he either wants her to die or simply just send her away from this place quietly.</p><p>Gretel turned towards me and bowed, “Miss Vienna, please remain in the room. It is dangerous outside.”</p><p>I simply nodded my head sticking to Vienna’s quiet personality when she is with anyone except Gretel and me.</p><p>She gave me one last look and left the room leaving Gregory in the room with me.</p><p>Gregory for his part didn’t do anything first and waited for around 10 minutes while making sure that the area was isolated and then cast a small barrier around the room.</p><p>He walked towards me and stood directly in front of me. “I am sorry for this young Miss but this is for the future of our Devil Race. Your sacrifice will not be in vain and it will push the Young Lord to regain the throne of the Underworld. You should go with pride like a Lucifer.” And then he struck.</p><p>And all that remained was darkness.</p><p><strong>- Cleria –</strong></p><p>Cleria channeled her power as her peerage members reinforced the barrier around the place.</p><p>The Bune Devil failed to notice that the one he struck seemed to have popped into a mass of smoke and instead looked at the floor. He noticed the barrier soon enough and quickly took on a defensive position with his experience as an Ultimate Class Devil.</p><p>“Who are you people? Come out.” Gregory shouted as dragon scales began to grow on his arms and face.</p><p>Cleria instructed her peerage to proceed as she herself used her Worthless Trait to prepare against her opponent. She had already made it a point to understand every Clan Trait of the 72 Pillar Houses from her brother.</p><p>Worthless matched with the power Damien had given her was a nightmare for her opponents.</p><p>Her Rook cast a spell to bind him in the place but considering the difference between the two people, it wouldn’t last more than half a minute but that was all that was needed. Her other Knight rushed in and slashed his sword towards the man’s chest and used his Sacred Gear Gravity Prison but was stopped by the dragon scale covered arms. Even under the spell and the effect of the Sacred Gear, the man’s movements were barely affected. Only his legs were temporarily frozen in place.</p><p>Her Queen took this opportunity to strike and threw several curses all aimed at his eyes and knees while she made her move too.</p><p>The greyish power of Worthless spread over and attacked him as he was defending a second attack from her rook, dissolving the dragon scales momentarily. Her Knight took this opportunity and rushed in to cut off his arm with his sword while his defenses were still down….however at that very instant, his aura burst out blowing them all away. The room was blown away while her entire peerage took a defensive position to block any following attack.</p><p>The demonic power burst in waves from the Bune Devil as he started changing into his dragon form.</p><p>The Bune’s Clan Trait doesn’t only allow them to tame dragons but also change into them and this was the Lord of the House of Bune who had fought in the Great War and even in the Civil War and survived. If he went down that easy, then the Devil Race wouldn’t have lasted this long.</p><p>The bindings on his legs broke as his size slowly increased taking the form of a green western dragon around twenty meters tall with a wingspan of over thirty meters. “Plan B.”</p><p>A wave of energy passed over her with her queen at the center. “Balance Breaker.”</p><p>Cleria assisted by using ‘Worthless’ to suppress the dragonification as much as she could and in the very next moment the ground shook and hundreds of swords sprung up from under the ground. Holy Swords of Dragon Slaying attribute. Two of the strongest weapons one could use against a Bune Devil.</p><p>The Sacred Gear collection plan had not only been used to collect the Longinus but almost any good Sacred Gears or Sacred Gear users around the world.</p><p>Her queen was someone with the power to use Fire Magic. Unfortunately she couldn’t control her powers well when she was under stress.</p><p>She had once lost control and burned down some soldiers who had been harassing her family for protection money. The unfortunate event also led to the death of her family. The poor girl was severely traumatized.</p><p>The thugs were well connected as they were commanded by the Lord of the place himself and she was declared a ‘Witch’ and was being hunted. That was how Cleria had found her.</p><p>She was later found out to have been a natural born Holy Sword wielder when she had touched Masaomi’s Ame No Murakumo no Tsurugi by mistake and was not affected by it. Thus they decided to use the Blade Blacksmith obtained from the search on her.</p><p>The swords tore through his defenses and the poison of the Dragon Slayer  and the holy attributes spread through his blood. The dragon let out a loud cry and released a terrifying amount of Demonic power. Her Rook and pawn cast several Barriers in front of them which began to crack as soon as they were cast. This power is almost several times higher than any of the other devils they had hunted in the past. The only one she had fought who was stronger than this was Diehauser and he was not even serious while Gregory was completely going for the kill.</p><p>The Demonic power burst crushed the entire surrounding. An Ultimate Class Devil is capable of destroying a small country. This estimate was not an exaggeration. The swords crumbled under the power of the attack.</p><p>Dragonification increases regeneration rate. That was however countered by the Dragon Slaying attribute. Cleria moved on to the third step.</p><p>Her pawn had collected the opened a space channel and brought out their weapons.</p><p>Her Knight once again increased the Gravity on Gregory however this time, the effect was only concentrated on half of his body. The dragon was injured enough to be imbalanced. Her pawn took this opportunity and threw a bomb right at the face of the Bune. A massive flame intercepted the bomb but the work was already done. The bomb set off leaving a massive flash of light burning the skin of any devil that was affected by it as well as temporarily blinding the massive dragon. “Amira, do it.” She used her Worthless power on one of the wings of the target and her Queen took this opportunity to bombard it with Holy Dragon Slayer swords. The thin draconic wing gave out as the dragon collapsed to the side.</p><p>It let out a burst of flame in all directions to get an opportunity to balance itself and gain some breathing room.</p><p>“Promotion Queen.” Cleria declared as her Pawn increased the output of the Barrier and temporarily stopped the approaching flames.</p><p>Suddenly black flames of incredible power burst out from her Queen and enveloped the flames of the dragon attacking them.</p><p>A head on collision between the two would have been a decisive defeat for her Queen but this was just stopping the stray flames from the attack. Amira could easily manage that. After all, if the Black Flames of Grudge lost so easily, then Amira would really shame her family name of….Dantes.</p><p>Amira Dantes, the great granddaughter of Edmond Dantes had inherited a part of his power. The fabled black flames of grudge which is strong enough to burn a High Class Devil to death.</p><p>After training, she had gained a certain bit of control over her power but still cannot use it to their full extent as it might harm her soul. However, stopping an attack like this is easy enough.</p><p>The injured wing of Gregory Bune was enveloped in the black flames and he let out a loud cry. His eyes turned red and it looked as if he was going to enter Outrage Mode.</p><p>“Quick, start Emergency Measures.”</p><p>Cleria’s fighting style was the style of Deihauser Belial. She was tutored by him to use strategies to overcome enemies stronger than herself.</p><p>Diehauser didn’t become the Emperor of the Rating Games solely relying on his strength. That would have been impossible.</p><p>A Rating Game’s rules sometimes makes it impossible to rely on strength alone. Diehauser was a master of strategies and since she was caught in the conspiracy, he began to actively coach her in these.</p><p>In these two months, she had already devised all possible counters against every known skill of Gregory Bune and Lord Paimon.</p><p>The poison in the Black Flames of Grudge took its effect and the left wing of the massive dragon while the anti-magic effect ate away at his flames.</p><p>Amira unleashed another barrage of Holy Dragon Slayer swords but this time it was defenseless. A sword struck its eye, destroying it instantly. It quickly hid its face behind its remaining wing trying to prevent itself from going completely blind.</p><p>Cleria wanted to take out its maneuverability so that even in its outrage form, it cannot cause too much damage. With the other wing damaged as well, this task was also accomplished.</p><p>The eye was just a bonus.</p><p>The dragon’s remaining eye turned red and its outrage mode was almost engaged when a voice stopped everything.</p><p>“You look to be in trouble, teacher.”</p><p>A wave of blue flames surrounded the dragon, making a protective circle around it and from within the flames a young, silver white haired boy with bright blue eyes slowly walked in.</p><p>He waved a hand and blue flames spread onto the dragon’s body but instead of harming it, it ate away at the flames of grudge, burning it with sheer power.</p><p>“I have stopped those flames but it would be better if you amputate that wing fast or the poison will kill you.”</p><p>The dragon almost on the verge of outrage was broken out of the trance by the soft voice. Cleria realized that it was not simply the voice. It was the Clan Trait of the Paimon. She would have never even doubted it if she hadn’t known the means of Damien.</p><p>The Clan Trait of the Paimon can be used to calm people down but to use it to calm down a dragon on the verge of outrage…. Only Damien Lucifer would be crazy enough to even think of something like that.</p><p>Damien stared at the dragon as his eye turned back to his orange colour and slowly changed back to devil form. Gregory Bune looked at the boy as he slowly collected himself, breathing heavily on his knees. The poison in his body affecting his movements.</p><p>“Y-young Lord.”</p><p>“Where is Vienna, teacher?” Damien turned towards her and her peerage and she felt a chill in her spine.</p><p>Gregory looked towards him and his eyes widened slightly. Looking at his back and then towards Cleria, he quickly breathed out. “I-it was t-them, Young Lord. They killed Miss Vienna.” He shouted pointing towards her.</p><p>A heavy pressure fell on the bodies of everyone present. She felt everyone in her peerage except for herself fall to their knees.</p><p>Damien’s face looked emotionless while she was completely bewildered. “One last thing teacher.”</p><p>“Yes Young Lord?”</p><p>Sphhhlt!</p><p>A hand pierced through the back of Gregory Bune ripping through his chest and tearing the heart out.</p><p>Cleria felt goosebumps all through her body.</p><p>The Damien in front of Gregory Bune faded while appearing behind Gregory with a heart in his hand.</p><p>“Why would my own subordinates attack my sister?” The pressure on the whole area was lifted and her peerage members got to their feet.</p><p>Cleria took on the lead and everyone, even the attacking army surrounded the place and kneeled in front of Damien. “Master.”</p><p>Blood flowed from Gregory’s mouth as he looked stunned at Damien. “Y-y-you!?.”</p><p>“You know teacher, I really wanted you to be on my side. In Fact I was actually hoping that it was Lord Paimon who was given the job.” Damien said as he looked at the heart in palm. “You were after all my teacher. One of the best I have had too. So…. Why did you have to do that? Rizevim is an idiot who enjoys the suffering of others. Why did you have to involve yourself in that?”</p><p>“W-why? W-hy do all this? “ He breathed out choking on his own blood.</p><p>“Hmm isn’t that obvious? Freedom and revenge.  Remember you said that the main family of Lucifer doesn’t get Death Marks in their House Crests.” He simply looked at me. “Well that was wrong. Everyone except Rizevim had a kill switch in their House Crest. Technically he could have killed Vienna while in his office. So the only way I can see all this happening is him trying to cause me unnecessary pain. Did you want to cause me pain, teacher? Did you betray me?” The silence was deafening in the whole place. “If that is so then I only did what you taught me – to kill all traitors.”</p><p>The innocent tone of voice sent severe chills down the spines of everyone present.</p><p>Gregory lost a bit of light from his eyes as he understood that he was nothing but a pawn in the game played by Rizevim. “I-is this because of the human?”</p><p>Cleria's pupil shrank as she expected Damien to blow up the man in a fit of rage. The result however was different.</p><p>“Among other things, yes. Rizevim is responsible for many deaths of the people connected to me, including my ‘father’….” The dying man’s head snapped in the direction of Damien, “Lucifer had actually survived the battle against God and even Leviathan was only half-dead. The one to kill them was….Rizevim.”</p><p>….</p><p>Cleria had not known….<em>that</em>.</p><p>She didn’t even know if it was true or Damien was lying.</p><p>“So you would understand why I am doing all this to get away from my <em>dear brother</em>? I can’t stand to live under the same roof as the killer of my parents. You were merely used as a pawn to cause more chaos.”</p><p>Somehow Cleria truly believed that statement. The only doubt was the identity of the parent that Damien was referring to.</p><p>Gregory Bune lowered his head. The shock of having their beliefs crushed and being betrayed is hard for anyone to recover so quickly.</p><p>“I-I am sorry.”</p><p>“If you are really sorry, then tell me, who else was involved in this? Who else wanted to kill Vienna?”</p><p>The man who lost almost everything breathed out the words, “Euclid Lucifuge made the plan and Lor….Rizevim agreed to it.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>The pain, poison and the loss of heart took its toll on the man as he crumbled down.</p><p>“As you have betrayed me, I cannot send you off in a proper manner….but I do want to do so….so will you teacher, make a deal with me?” he looked at Damien with half glazed eyes and blinked. “Offer me all your power and in return I will give you an ending worthy of your name.”</p><p>“O-k-ay.”</p><p>“Then goodbye Teacher.” A pillar of Blue Flames burst around Damien and rose to the skies. It stayed like that for a minute after which it dissipated.</p><p>No one said a word.</p><p>The body of Gregory Bune, The Lord of the House of Bune, the son of the Original Bune, disappeared along with his soul in the legendary flames of Asmodeus.</p><p>Damien stood up in this place. “Set up a spell strong enough to vapourize the whole place and teleport us to our base.”</p><p>Cleria bowed.</p><p>It was finally the end of this farce.</p><p><strong>- Damien –</strong></p><p>I did feel a tinge of sadness despite everything when I ripped Gregory’s heart out. I didn’t have to lie when I said that I really wanted him on my side.</p><p>That said that option went down the drain as soon as he agreed to attack Vienna.</p><p>I walked towards the place where Ophelia was waiting for me.</p><p>“Is it done Ophelia?”</p><p>“Yes Master. Father has sent a ‘dying message’ to the headquarters that everyone in the base has been killed and that you died while killing eight Ultimate Class Devils in a fight along with Gretel.” She showed me a contract. “He signed the suicide contract before heroically self-destructing to take down an enemy Ultimate Class Devil.”</p><p>Her tone was emotionless but I felt a bit of emptiness inside her. He was after all her father, no matter how much of a scumbag he was.</p><p>“Keep that for your brother or yourself. Use it when your brother is stronger than your father or on yourself or else he might not be able to withstand the energy.”</p><p>She bowed slightly, “Yes Master.”</p><p>I gained all of Gregory’s powers at the last moment and I could feel my Demonic Power reserves almost at the level of Mid Satan Class Devil. It is just that the potency of his Demonic Power was much less than my own so the gain was less.</p><p>The best gain however was the Clan Trait of the Bune. The dragonification aside, the Dragon Tamer abilities alone are one of the best things I could ask for.</p><p>It would have been harder to make him agree to the deal if he hadn’t been injured, poisoned and on the verge of death. My ‘Bewitching Voice’ wouldn’t have worked so well on convincing him. He would have noticed the change in his thoughts in an instant.</p><p>All I had to do was push his thoughts in a direction and take all the benefits. I stopped using the ‘Bewitching Voice’ directly before the deal so that it doesn’t affect the deal itself.</p><p>Dragonification also has a lot of room to progress. I remember that Ophis could make a body out of Great Red’s flesh which would be far stronger than any natural Devil Body. Dragons naturally have a higher power limit than Devils. This obviously doesn’t apply to me as I have The Blank’s Essence but Dragons power is also useful for something else. Dragon’s souls are exceptionally strong.</p><p>I mean Vritra’s soul was chopped into pieces for centuries and could still be combined and even awakened as a whole again.</p><p>This shows the tenacity of a Dragons soul.</p><p>Can the Dragonification Trait help me replicate this Trait?</p><p>I looked forward as Gretel came towards me.</p><p>No words were said. I went ahead and washed my hands.</p><p>Gretel used her magic to dry them.</p><p>I somehow didn’t know how to feel.</p><p>This is the opportunity that I had been waiting for all this while but now I don’t know how to feel.</p><p>The attacking force set up the spell. Cleria returned to me along with Ophelia. Their peerages stood behind them.</p><p>The rest were teleported by the user of Dimension Lost.</p><p>“It is done Master. You can activate the spell anytime.” Ophelia bowed slightly.</p><p>As I thought of the scene about to appear in front of us, a sudden thought came to my mind.</p><p>“Do you know what true art is?” I asked, smiling a bit.</p><p>They had a confused look on their faces and I chuckled at my own joke.</p><p>“True Art is an….EXPLOSION!.”</p><p><strong>BOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!</strong></p><p>“Let’s start the next part of our lives with an explosion.”</p><p><strong>- Scene Change –</strong></p><p>We teleported to the base after the wonderful exhibit of art.</p><p>“Dummy!” Vi ran into me, hugging me tightly.</p><p>She almost forcibly had to be kept here when she found out about my plans.</p><p>I had kept the whole plan and the supposed dangers of it from her till the very last moment so that she didn’t do anything stupid.</p><p>She had denied staying back as soon as she heard that Gretel and me will be in the very center of the fight.</p><p>It took a lot of convincing from both Gretel and me to finally get her to agree to this and stay behind at the base. She was after all the target of the assassination.</p><p>There might have been more than one person and attempts. Even a stray hit from an Ultimate Class Devil could have killed her.</p><p>She is strong. Much stronger than probably any other Devil her age right now….but she is still at best as strong as a strong Middle Class Devil. Not even a High Class one.</p><p>There was no way I was going to bring her to such a place where there were dangers at every corner.</p><p>“It is fine. We are free from now on.”</p><p>Yes. Finally free. No need to hide my talents. No need to pretend to have stupid reasons for everything I do. No need to hold myself back anymore for anything.</p><p>Right around the age of twelve when the children of Devils start their fastest growth period, till the age of twenty five.</p><p>I am going to abuse the fuck out of this time.</p><p>Next goal is to make my subordinates into Peak Satan Class and my marked subordinates into at least Pseudo-Super Devil Class in the next few years.</p><p>I plan to use every skill from every world I can think of in this aspect.</p><p><strong>- Scene Change –</strong></p><p>I stood in the training field of the underground base and watched Vienna and Gretel learn the Shadow Clone Technique.</p><p>It has been two weeks since I became free.</p><p>The first thing we did was pass on the ownership of Dimension Lost to Gretel. The Ultimate Class Devil who possessed it had already signed the loyalty contract and had easily given up the Longinus but not before making a Spatial Barrier around the whole base. Helena and Gretel had then worked on the Dimension to stabilize the barrier even further.</p><p>I want to start their training but to truly milk every bit of time, I decided to teach them the Shadow Clone Technique.</p><p>This Technique can be learned due to the effect of The Archmage Essence. It not only allows me to use any type of energy but also teach others any system of energy usage.</p><p>The Shadow Clone Technique can be used to learn any magic or studies as they need the experience and the physical training can be done by the main body in the meantime for the all-round development of skills.</p><p>I haven’t seen any devil except for the Bunes and Barbatos able to fight at close range and even they only do that due to their Clan Trait being physically attributed. Apart from Sairaorg, there has almost never been a Devil who has trained in Touki. Not even Diehauser Belial.</p><p>Sairaorg could crush any High Class Devil with Touki alone without even trying. This goes to show just how much potential was being wasted by all the Devils.</p><p>We don’t have any alternative other than to become stronger to even live. &gt; The Old Satan Faction will be hounding us like mad dogs should they ever discover Gretel, Vienna and I are still alive and the Current Government would be too wary of us to not try anything. People in places of power more often than not become too resistant to give it up and react extremely hard when they feel any threat to their power.</p><p>Power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely.</p><p>I don’t know how much the current government is corrupted, but one thing is sure and that is….the old guys will absolutely not give up their power.</p><p>Not to mention the other factions.</p><p>So for the sake of our freedom, there is only one way out – To become so strong that they will not even dare to fight against us.</p><p>Why is it that even with all the bullshit the current government is pulling with the Evil Pieces, no one declares war on them and just watches the entire devil race accumulating power?. Well there is only one reason….well kinda two reasons Sirzechs Lucifer and Ajuka Beelzebub.</p><p>Two of the top ten strongest beings in the various worlds are in the Devil Faction.</p><p>The old guys use them as shields and do whatever they want.</p><p>As for the two themselves, from what I have found out from Charlene, the younger niece of Falbium Asmodeus, Sirzechs Lucifer is someone who genuinely wants peace. He has seen too much war and was in a similar position as the current us during his childhood, hiding his power alongside Ajuka to avoid the attention of the Satan Descendants and their lackeys who were then the ruling body.</p><p>From that they rose and took over the rule. In a way I can sympathize with them as I have seen the behavior of the Old Satan Faction and I know their feelings…. but that will probably have no effect on our relationship.</p><p>Ajuka Beelzebub. Probably the person whom I respect the most and am the most wary of despite not having met the man himself is someone according to Charlene who will support Sirzechs in whatever he does. It’s Sirzechs who keeps quiet when the old devils cause trouble to not start off disputes and solve things in a peaceful manner so Ajuka also keeps quiet.</p><p>I can understand Sirzechs’ thinking as well. The Devil Faction might seem like the strongest of the three factions but its strength is in fact not stable at all.</p><p>The Fallen Angels might have people with different opinions but if there is a war, they will all fight for the Grigori, there is not a shred of doubt about it, but the Devil Race would likely go into a Civil War between different Houses as well as between the Reincarnated Devils and the Pillar Houses as soon as the news of a war arrives and internal disputes at the time of war is probably the worst thing one can ask for. The dissatisfied parties grit their teeth and bear because they are afraid that a rebellion in normal times will be crushed and even if the Satans are involved, they will not give anyone any mercy. They have no hope of winning against such monsters so they bear everything.</p><p>If that changes somehow, then well…. Lucifer save the Pillar Houses.</p><p>All of this is however Charlene’s honest opinion. I will have to see things for myself.</p><p>I for my part have started to use the Shadow Clones to work on several things. Those are first, my Illusion. After getting a feel of Razevan’s ‘The Prince of Lies’, I have started implementing it in my illusion technique. Hiding the manipulation of energy under a lie. This step requires experience with the Clan Trait itself and is not like the normal Fidelius which is just a simple spell and is just done by using it once. I am using the prisoners as test subjects. Hopefully I can gain enough experience with it soon enough.</p><p>The Illusion is going to be absolutely stunning. I can already feel it.</p><p>The second is the training of my body. While I broke and healed my muscles repeatedly with my demonic power and so my body is far stronger than a normal Devil (or else I couldn’t have torn out Gregory’s Heart so easily), there is still a lot of room for improvement.</p><p>Touki is an obvious skill to learn.</p><p>Another thing that I want to learn is….Armament Haki. It is the only Haki that I haven’t been able to use so far though.</p><p>Armament Haki has extremely high potential. Especially for someone like me who has an endless supply of Haki that I even have to consciously suppress so as to not accidentally crush everything suddenly. The training basically involves the Clones trying to….well….will the Haki into existence. It hasn’t been too successful though. I can feel myself getting stronger but I am not sure if I have Armament Haki. I remember that the Kuja doesn’t all have black coating for Haki. That is supposed to be one of the stronger ones. My current level was like the Kuja crew. To advance forward, I followed the words of Rayleigh and fought with my clones.</p><p>Haki develops under pressure.</p><p>The third is my Sacred Gear.</p><p>I have finally used Telos Karma permanently on myself.</p><p>The Power of Luck is really a cheat. There is a chance that something can happen and Telos Karma just increases that chance several thousands of times over depending on my power levels. If the power is enough, even Gods can be killed. This fact is in fact not wrong at all. Telos Karma is overpowered.</p><p>For example if there is a chance that someone will slip during a fight. Telos Karma can manipulate that probability which is say one is ten thousand to absolute if the user is strong enough. I don’t know what the Balance Breaker is or how to reach there so I am only using the normal form.</p><p>This Longinus is a cheat among cheats.</p><p>Need Money. Manipulate the probability and you can win a lottery very easily.</p><p>Need to kill someone. They might slip on a banana peel and get stabbed with a fork during the slip.</p><p>These are probably the easiest uses.</p><p>The better ones are just manipulating the probability of an experiment to succeed, manipulating the probability of someone breaking their limit during training or even some conceptual tier manipulations simply. Imagine using the Enhancement Drug on a low class devil and manipulating the probability so that they survive. Continue it a few times and we have a High Class or even an Ultimate Class devil.</p><p>This Sacred Gear was born to be paired with The Essence of the Mad Doctor.</p><p>The fourth is my attempt to search for my own Clan Trait of the Lucifer House. Did I inherit one? If yes then what is it?</p><p>Razevan proved that I might have one completely different from other people. Something associated with the Myth of Lucifer.</p><p>While not having one might not make much of a difference for me as I can always pass off The Broker Essence as the Clan Trait, having one will no doubt be helpful to me.</p><p>Till now there has been no progress.</p><p>“This thing is too hard.” Vienna pouted as she huffed in exhaustion.</p><p>“It is supposed to be. You don’t even know the basics about chakra, how do you expect to learn the Technique which is Ranked B in terms of difficulty? Moreover due to our Lucifer lineage, we are far stronger than normal devils, who in turn are already stronger than humans. Chakra is dependent on someone’s physical energy which is life force which we have in spades and mental energy which is our magic which we also have much much above the rest. With such enormous amounts of Chakra, it is only obvious that you will take a lot of time controlling it. Once you do it however, you can reduce your training by several times. So stop complaining and concentrate already.”</p><p>She pouted but as the first step of training, took a leaf and tried to stick it to her forehead.</p><p>I made a calculation and found out that I had enough chakra to make around one thousand Shadow Clones. It is just that the information that I get back after even twenty minutes of that is enough to make me faint.</p><p>To be precise it was around two week worth of information. A devil’s brain is much stronger than a Human’s but that much information was like a mental attack. I won’t be taking that risk anytime soon.</p><p>I decided to test my limits. To do so, I started with dispelling twenty Shadow Clones after twenty minutes, then forty Shadow Clones, then sixty and then eighty until I would feel serious discomfort.</p><p>My limit to such a method was three hundred and twenty clones at once for twenty minutes. I would have a serious headache for an hour after that. I did discover that my limit to the information overload was increasing with each such mental attack. The process is a bit slow but it is definitely there.</p><p>Today I also have something to look forward to. Ophelia will be bringing Kuroka and Shirone here for training.</p><p>They had been treating Celine all this time to try and heal her mind.</p><p>As soon as I had transferred over to the Russia Base, Katerea had gone over to the prison where Celine and others were kept and proceeded to kill a few of the prisoners to vent her frustrations. It was obviously done on my orders.</p><p>Celine being killed there allowed me to use The Binder’s Essence and summon her with Ophelia.</p><p>She has since then been in treatment for the mental injuries.</p><p>I want to test how Senjutsu interacts with Chakra and if the youkai of this world can use Chakra easily.</p><p>I sensed some auras entering the training ground and stopped my training, looking back.</p><p>Ophelia, Cleria, Kuroka, Shirone, Lavinia, Victoria, Helena and Alicia came together.</p><p>Except Charlene and Celine, all the people bound by me are present.</p><p>Alicia, Charlene, Helena and Victoria often have other jobs to do so they cannot stay away from public view for very long. Even here, the Shadow Clones are extremely useful, that is why I called them all to come over and start learning the technique.</p><p>Kuroka is the same age as Vienna, which is ten years and a few months old and hasn’t had to go through the experiments. Although her strength was supposed to be a lot lower than her current self, the nerfed essences made up for the absence of the experiments and even more.</p><p>She has been trained by an expert of Senjutsu since the very beginning without the interference of the demonic power. She is in a sense even better than she would have been if she hadn’t met me.</p><p>“Damien-samnyaa~” the little black cat rushed to me and hugged my arm, her tail swishing behind her in joy.</p><p>We have talked several times since I bound her through her link so we were not strangers.</p><p>Shirone on the other hand was much more cheerful than the emotionless self she would have ended up as. She was three years younger than Kuroka at slightly above seven and had an extremely cute pixie cut with a white kimono which had a space for her tail. Her ears twitched as she looked at me shyly but didn’t come closer without asking. Her ears twitched as she watched Kuroka hug me.</p><p>I beckoned her with my other hand and she shyly came forward. She is so cute.</p><p>I caressed her head and she literally purred and I couldn’t help but smile.</p><p>“Hello Shirone, how have you been?” I asked the girl who had almost melted with the headpats. She looked up at me and merely nodded shyly.</p><p>Someone on the side was perhaps equal parts jealous and fascinated by the while haired cat loli. Vienna looked at me with a pout and came and took my other arm, asserting her place. Such behavior reminds me of the time when Aria was alive. Vienna had gotten much more reserved with such things.</p><p>“Kuroka, Shirone, Lavinia, meet these two. The gremlin hanging on to me is Vienna Lucifer and the other one is Gretel Lucifuge. They are the closest people to me and you both can trust them as much as you trust me. Vienna, Gretel, the black haired one here is Kuroka, the blonde one is Lavinia and the cute one here is Shirone. I think you already know the rest. They are all people whom I have directly marked. You can ask them for any help if you want. Shirone and Kuroka will also be joining us from time to time while Lavinia will be staying with us from now on to train.”</p><p> “Ooh what will we be learning today nyaa?”</p><p>“Ninjutsu.”</p><p>Helena raised an eyebrow. “Isn’t that a specialty of the Ninjas in Japan? I had no idea that you also recruited a Ninja, Young Lord.”</p><p>“I haven’t. The ninjas in Japan use different techniques than the one I am talking about. I will only be teaching all of you a few tricks which will be useful for everyone. But first of all we will have to learn how to use Chakra.” I stopped Kuroka from speaking up, already knowing what she was going to say. “This Chakra is different from the Nature Energy you use. It is a combination of the Physical Energy or Touki with the Spiritual Energy that the Onmiyoji generally use in equal parts. That energy will then be manipulated with the use of several hand signs. Each hand sign aligns with an animal and a sequence of these hand signs will be used to perform a technique. As all of you have already been marked by me, you can use almost any type of energy as long as you have a complete idea about it. We will be practicing the use of chakra first and learn how to control it.”</p><p>I made ten Shadow Clones for them to practice with.</p><p>I have to think about some basic ninjutsu too.</p><p>Some of them are extremely useful.</p><p>But for now I need to concentrate on Martial Arts.</p><p>The Essence of the King gives the user an extremely high talent and proficiency with Martial arts and all kinds of weapons but I still need to learn them because of the nerf. I asked Cleria for help and she suggested practicing with her Knight Desmond for starters.</p><p>As for Touki, Kuroka has learned the basics and I just need to raise my basic strength.</p><p>For a long uninterrupted training period, I made only one hundred and twenty clones. With ten clones guiding the rest, I assigned the other ten to practice the swordsmanship stances, twenty five each for Mad Doctor research, Illusion Training, Magic Training and Haki Training.</p><p>This is going to take a long while even with the clones.</p><p><strong>- Euclid Lucifuge –</strong></p><p>Euclid smashed the bottles on the table, shattering them in rage.</p><p>The bottles of alcohol both filled and empty made a mess of broken glass on the entire floor.</p><p>Again.</p><p>He lost again.</p><p>Again to some guy who claims to be Lucifer.</p><p>This time however Gretel died as well.</p><p>Unlike Grayfia, he cannot even see her anymore.</p><p>He had high hopes for her when she started improving in the Lucifuge House’s Magic. An Ultimate Class Devil at 12 years of age. She would have surpassed Grayfia. She would have surpassed that red haired fake. She would have been his masterpiece.</p><p><a href=\"https://BUT….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">BUT….it</a> was all gone.</p><p>Another attack.</p><p>Euclid would bet his life that it was the red haired bastard trying to finish off anything and everything related to him. They must have found out about Damien Lucifer and Gretel, two potential Super Devils in the making so they had attacked in advance. It was something he would have done as well. It was something anyone with a shred of brain would have done to remove future threats.</p><p>And Gretel had to follow that entitled brat who was born in a test tube.</p><p>He had already been the reason for his mother’s death because she chose to carry him for nine months as a service to the late Lucifer.</p><p>Carrying someone with the blood of two Super Devils without being related to them by blood took a toll on her, sucking her remaining life away leaving her with only four to five years of lifespan. She might have already known that and choose that way to kill herself, ending any chances of any other Lucifuge being born from her. Euclid knew this but he still couldn’t do anything to stop it. He wanted her to pay for her betrayal. The betrayal which had cost him his beloved Grayfia, yet….</p><p>Now everything is gone.</p><p>Dead.</p><p>They were all dead.</p><p>He had denied it once but no matter how much he checked, it was the truth. The trackers on their souls were gone. The kill switches on both Damien Lucifer and the half breed were gone. He went and personally witnessed the scene of battle and the only thing left there were the eerie blue flames threatening to devour the souls of anyone who came even close to the place in the midst of a gigantic crater as if some ancient Titan had simply torn out that piece of the world.</p><p>While thinking of all this, he got a call from the Headquarters.</p><p><em>“Euclid.”</em></p><p>“Lord Rizevim.”</p><p><em>“It seems that the blood of my father and Asmodeus turned out to be a failure. If he couldn’t even survive against a bunch of trash, then he was of no use to begin with. And here I thought that he would be better than Razevan.”</em></p><p>A part of his mind asked him if he could do the same? Taking down eight Ultimate Class Devils and two Longinus wielders at eleven years of age but a larger part of his brain, the one which was filled with rage and envy pushed this aside. Damien <a href=\"https://Lucifer….no\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lucifer….no</a> he was not a Lucifer. A Lucifer wouldn’t be so weak. He wouldn’t have failed to save Gretel. There was no way he was a Lucifer. Euclid clenched his hand as he listened to Lord Rizevim.</p><p><em>“I think it is time that mother dearest picked up the slack and helped us out. I want you to collect the best team of scientists that you can and start experiments to make new devils. Those insects are very proud of their numbers, so we will face them with numbers.”</em></p><p>“Yes Lord Rizevim. I will do so as soon as possible.”</p><p>An idea came to Euclid’s mind.</p><p>The Mother of All Devils who gave birth to the entire Devil Race. The one who gave birth to the first Lucifuge. Couldn’t she be used to make another Lucifuge? one better than every other.</p><p>The idea stuck to his mind and everytime he thought of it, he became more convinced of his plan.</p><p>A new devil race.</p><p>If the current devil race will keep denying him his dreams, then he will create a new Devil race to work with.</p><p>__________________________________x__________________________________________________________________x________________________________</p><p><strong>Beta Reader: LuluViBritania(FF.N, SB, WN and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note :</strong></p><p><strong>It's been a long time since I got back to this story.

    "title": "The Deal: Chapter 9 : Breaking Free",
    "content": "<p><strong>Disclaimer : I own nothing.</strong></p><p><strong>Chapter 9 : Breaking Free.</strong></p><p><strong>- Damien –</strong></p><p>I woke up the next morning upon hearing Gretel’s voice in my mind through our connection.</p><p>Aria’s letter was too much for me and inside the barriers I let all my emotions out crying all of last night.</p><p><em>“Master, are you alright? Please answer.”</em> Gretel’s voice sounded once more.</p><p>“I am fine, Gretel. You can return back. It is safe now. I need you and Vienna beside me.”</p><p><em>“Yes Master.”</em> The reply was instant and within a minute I felt the barriers in the place being pierced by a teleportation. Observation Haki confirmed the identity of the arrivals.</p><p>I got up and left the room to go back to my room.</p><p>I hadn’t realized it but I had fallen asleep in the meeting room after Razevan hand left last night.</p><p>Gretel’s emotions were on her face and Vienna looked like she would shrink into a ball all of a sudden….and that hurt.</p><p>I can just imagine how much it would have hurt Aria when she saw Vienna being this scared or crying over her. Lying to her children and then even dying for them.</p><p>How much would it have hurt for Razevan who would have been known and remembered as a villain by the person he loved and valued the most in the entire world even after his death?</p><p>I don’t know how much this world is similar to what I know but what I do know is….that it has changed since I came here.</p><p>Razevan and Aria were barely mentioned in the story I read. An abusive father who killed his wife. I clenched my fingers tightly.</p><p>I went through many emotions last night. I wouldn’t say that I was not angry. Someone played me. There was anger. I was angry even with Aria….but after objectively thinking things through though, I realized that their actions were perfectly reasonable. Hell, I would have done something similar in their situation.</p><p>Their ultimate goal was for Vienna to live safely and from what I know they would have succeeded even without me.</p><p>If anything it was my arrival that might have made things worse. It did give Aria three more years with Vienna than was supposed to happen but still.</p><p>And the worst part is that I need to keep this burden to myself. Looking at Vi’s face, her small hands clutching at Gretel’s skirt I couldn’t stop myself and went ahead and hugged her. She returned the hug and her tiny hands gripped me with so much force as if she was afraid of letting me go, as if I would disappear if she did.</p><p>I brought Gretel into our hug as well.</p><p>This right now is my family.</p><p>“Don’t worry. It’s fine now. I am here.” I reassured the young girl who was holding me for dear life as I repeatedly caressed her hair.</p><p>It took me a couple of hours to coax them.</p><p><strong>- Scene Change -</strong></p><p>Razevan’s ability was experienced by me and I used Archmage to make a copy of it. It was much faster because the experience was direct instead of just looking or learning the said power.</p><p>It was both a blessing and a curse. I could see why Razevan who was born with this power was so reluctant in trusting someone.</p><p>There is almost nothing that can hide under this ability. Obviously Vienna is still young and Gretel is connected to me and won’t even try to hide from me but still if I don’t turn this ability off, there is a high chance that I would lose my trust in the world.</p><p>The servants, the people around me in general all say one thing and have something else entirely in their hearts. It is honestly disgusting.</p><p>This ability is much more precise than Observation Haki.</p><p>Two weeks left till the attack. I am looking for the people who are here to protect this place and the people who are here to plot against me.</p><p>The main person here is the one who is sent to assassinate Vi.</p><p>We don’t allow anyone to come near her at any time, so the chances of them being a mid or low class devil is near to none. The only way they could harm her is by poisoning and even if the Mad Doctor Essence I have shared with her is nerfed, it is strong enough to take care of such poisons.</p><p>That leaves High Class and Ultimate Class ones. The High Class ones wouldn’t be able to touch her normally if they don’t gang up on her and with Gretel being beside her all the time, even that is somehow doubtable.</p><p>That leaves the Ultimate Class devils by the method of elimination. The two who are sent with me. Paimon and Bune.</p><p>A slight conversation with Paimon revealed that he was a bootlicker of Rizevim of the highest order. He is the kind of selfish person who would sell anything of his just to rise up higher in the social ladder.</p><p>Ophelia, despite being looked at like the Old Satan Faction remnant, still brought her house to be one of the strongest ones economically speaking in the entire Underworld, all on her own…. and this bastard is ready to waste all of that just to stand on the top.</p><p>I can see why Ophelia hates him so much.</p><p><em>“My Lord, we have found a person matching the description of the one you asked for.” </em>My thoughts were interrupted by Ophelia’s message.</p><p>“Oh!”</p><p><em>“In the Forneus Territory, there is a hospital where a girl named Ingvild, no last name, was found with Devil’s Sleeping sickness. She has been there for the last one hundred years. I did not dig deeper so as to avoid detection but the one who found the information said that she was being guarded by a pair of High Class Devils at all times while the Hospital itself had an Ultimate Class Devil in-charge of the whole place.”</em></p><p>Finally,</p><p>Someone I had been looking for a long time.</p><p>“Good job. Make sure not to lose sight of her. I will be arriving there soon.”</p><p><em>“Yes My Lord.”</em></p><p>“Ophelia…. I have received information that someone here is planning to assassinate Vienna. The major suspects are Gregory Bune and….”</p><p><em>“My Father.”</em></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><em>“I assume they will try to throw that on the heads of the attacking forces or the current Government to get you against them?”</em> She got it in one go too.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><em>“I will leave whatever you do to him to you, My Lord. There is a high chance that he will be killed no matter whether he completes or fails this mission, to cover up the loose ends. I suggest taking away his powers before killing him.” Her voice was completely emotionless and I couldn’t see her directly to know what she was feeling through Observation Haki either.</em></p><p>“Ophelia.”</p><p><em>“I am fine My Lord. I had truly hoped that he would change. He didn’t, not in the last four hundred years. There is no chance for him to change now. Even if there was, it’s too late now. I have a family to protect. I don’t want him to ruin everything we have here.”</em></p><p>“Okay. Would you like me to pass his powers to you or your brother?”</p><p><em>“I leave it to you, My Lord.”</em></p><p>“In that case I will send the contract after taking his power away. However in the off-chance that he is not the one behind the assassination….”</p><p><em>“There is a high chance that he will still be killed one way or the other. If possible, I would like to meet him in the last moments.”</em></p><p>“Alright….”</p><p>With that said, she cut off the communication.</p><p>I looked towards the training room. Vienna was training with Gretel.</p><p>I had already told both of them about the assassination order for Vienna and Gretel hasn’t left her side since then.</p><p>I would pity anyone trying to fight Gretel when she is in this mood.</p><p>She starts off with her space attacks instead of the usual ice ones.</p><p>I need to find an opportunity for them to leave this place without being noticed. If Vienna suddenly disappears then the one targeting her would easily know and inform this back.</p><p>A Shadow Clone transformed into someone else with Illusion Magic can help me out with this. I don’t want any unnecessary risks.</p><p>I just need to find a suitable opportunity to sneak Vienna out. She can’t be put in any danger.</p><p>She is barely High Mid Class Devil strength right now, without her Sacred Gear. Gretel is a solid Mid Ultimate Class Devil and with her insane control in space magic, she can easily fight a High Ultimate Class equally.</p><p>I wouldn’t have called them back at all but their absence would have raised questions and even if I diverted everyone with transformed Shadow Clones, Vienna and Gretel would have been worried sick and would have done something stupid in their anxiety. Thus I can only delay.</p><p>The last encounter with Razevan has been making me quite iffy about any hidden dangers. Honestly if it wasn’t because of the random Lucifer Trait coming out, I don’t think I would have been caught. Occlumency that I use simply makes my mind blank for others to see or feel nothing. It doesn’t show any emotion at all.</p><p>A normal empath might not succeed but Razevan is someone who is born with a gift to break through such defenses. That said his theory was also correct.</p><p>If I make my mind blank, that means I am trying to hide something. A mind is almost never blank in a normal situation. The trick of false memories can be used but I don’t know the exact method. It is all theoretical and I would need to spend a lot of time to grind it into something more….solid.</p><p>Anyways I thought about the Sacred Gears that I received from Razevan.</p><p>Innovate Clear. I wonder what I can do with this and Telos Karma.</p><p>Razevan’s Trait however did easily provide me with something that I had been missing for a while.</p><p>The way to hide my energy.</p><p>The last step to my illusion spell.</p><p>I am starting to incorporate that into my illusion but it will need a lot of work. I am not as proficient as Razevan in using the Trait. I can only train in earnest after getting out of here.</p><p>“Is there something wrong, Master?” I heard Gretel’s voice from beside me.</p><p>“Hmm….nothing for now. I am wondering when we should evacuate. I still need to do something. You stay with Vienna and retreat when I tell you to. I will be fine. Just don’t come back until I tell you to.”</p><p>“Master!”</p><p>“Please take care of Vienna, Gretel. I can only trust you with her. I still have something to do here.”</p><p>I looked into her eyes and said once more.</p><p>“As long as you are by Vienna’s side, I will be able to concentrate on the work here….please.”</p><p>She looked extremely reluctant. Her emotions were practically screaming at her but her loyalty towards me drove her.</p><p>Sensing her emotion I brought her into a hug and soon we were jumped by the small gremlin in the room.</p><p><strong>- Scene Change –</strong></p><p>I used an illusion on myself to look different from my normal self.</p><p>Ophelia had already arranged for someone to pick me up and take me to Ingvild’s room. This time however the wielder of Dimension Lost followed me.</p><p>“The Forneus Territories’ hospitals are quite prosperous. I have heard that they are linked with the Sitri as both have similar House Traits.” My guide, Desmond Valentine spoke. He is Cleria’s Knight piece. A knight of the Medieval Age who was resurrected by Cleria after he was stabbed by his companions. Politics was a bitch even back then.</p><p>Cleria had warned him beforehand, which was highly unusual but at the same time a very smart move on Cleria’s part, but he had refused to believe in the words of a ‘devil’. Well he did pay for it. Cleria was summoned by him at the verge of death when he had used his own blood to draw the circle and summon her.</p><p>The condition had been to avenge himself of the traitor and he would serve her forever loyally.</p><p>She took it. Desmond slaughtered everyone.</p><p>He has been following Cleria since then. His wife had died in the plot back then and he never took another lover or wife. A model knight from the stories.</p><p>“I have heard that but on the other hand, the rumors about the current members of the Forneus are also quite prevalent. They are quite a….well bully.”</p><p>“It is mainly the younger ones and the branch members. The actual Lord Forneus is actually a very principled man. I have had the opportunity to accompany Lady Cleria and Lord Diehauser to some events and talked to the person. He is a man with a knightly spirit.”</p><p>“A knightly spirit eh. So he is still loyal to the original Satan Houses because of his knightly spirit?”</p><p>“That is the case. Arnack Forneus has been one of the commanders in the Great War and was especially promoted to the rank by Satan Leviathan. He was chosen over many of the original seventy two pillar devils for this position and that was a very high class honour during the Great War. He has been loyal to the House of Leviathan since then. The house however does not share his views. They are all in the Old Satan Faction for power.”</p><p>This world was so much bigger and everyone had a connection with each other. While the three factions were at each other’s necks all the time, if a foreign power tried to attack, they fend off the force together.</p><p>The Old Satan faction are people who don’t give a fuck about this balance and that is why there is a high chance of the Angels and the Fallen attacking them together with the current government. The current government while poaching others from different factions, try to maintain a semblance of peace.</p><p>As we were talking, the person with the Dimension Lost took the lead and covered us in the Fog.</p><p>This place is a whole other dimension, kinda like Obito’s but much more versatile. We walked in towards the hospital room Ingvild was kept in.</p><p>I don’t have another Binder’s slot right now so I choose to take her with me instead. She was simply replaced by a disguised clone which will dispel after a while. By then she will be far away. The equipment has already been prepared by Ophelia. Everything is ready and is only waiting for Ingivid to reach there.</p><p>I put an Illusion on the two guards outside which were almost half step Ultimate Class. The security was also settled. Ingvild’s value can be seen just from this. She has High Satan Class Demonic power despite being inactive for the last hundred years. If she had trained, who knows what level she would have attained?</p><p>This was also considering that she has the ‘Sea Serpent of the End’ and ‘Nereid Kyrie’ subspecies. Her potential is no less than Vienna and I am not going to let it go to waste at all.</p><p>“My Lord, shall I?”</p><p>“Hmm, the guards have been neutralized.</p><p>Desmond signaled to the other member and he let the fog wrap around her. I picked her up in my arms and left a shadow clone in place. We were gone before anyone could find anything.</p><p>The fog opened up in a place far away from the swampy Forneus territory. This place was a small town not unlike a town from the west. The buildings were wooden and the place was full of people going about their day to day lives. The only difference was that these people had different appearances from a human. Some had reddish skin while some had blue horns, some had scales in their arms while some had blackish cornea. These were all devils.</p><p>To see the normal devils from a close distance was a relatively new experience for me. I haven’t been allowed out in the underworld and the people around me were at the very minimum, High Class devils in general.</p><p>We have to remember that the Seventy Two Pillar devils are actually a minority. Even if all of them are collected together, they won’t even form a thousand in total. It is on the lower side to be precise, a few hundreds.</p><p>When it was said that the devils had lost a large part of their population and that High Class devils were endangered, it was not a joke at all.</p><p>These devils are what Nobles would be to normal humans. So it is reasonable that if there are nobles, there will be peasants. That much is obvious.</p><p>A Noble only takes care of the administration and security of the territory. The whole territory is still mostly consisting of these common low and mid class devils.</p><p>It kinda makes me wonder just how Lucifer and Lilith did this. They created an entire fucking race. That is absolutely a Chief God level power.</p><p>Anything lower than that is impossible. It is completely a mystery how Lucifer who was as strong as a Low Class God at best could do something like this. Even if we attribute his fighting against his father to his power of ‘Denial of the Divine’, it is still absolutely confusing how just these two could do it.</p><p>I do have some theories though. The most sound one is that it was due to the Fruits of Eden. It is always women and fruits. *<em>Kaguya</em>*</p><p>Lilith eating them might have changed something in her. She would have eaten some considering she knew and even hid some of them, so it is not unreasonable to think that she didn’t eat even one. The fruits of the Garden of Eden have a lot of power. I haven’t heard the slightest news about them and neither about Lilith.</p><p>I am not even trying to find her using other people because I know that she is probably hidden away somewhere by Rizevim. If I try to find her directly, there is a high chance that Rizevim will catch on and I don’t want to leave any kind of trail that may point to me.</p><p>After I am free, it is all fair game though.</p><p> Anyways, these low class devils still have ten thousand years of lifespan on average. The ability to train themselves to the highest degree and reach Satan Class. Yes, each one of the Low Class Devils has that potential. The only difference is that while the ones from High Class Devil Households become stronger even if they do practically nothing, and still reach a level of peak High Class Devil while the Satan Clans reach Satan Class just by lazing around, these people have to bust their muscles for every bit of power gain. The rate is also slower than any of the people with High Class families.</p><p>These people will take around a hundred years of hard work normally to become a Satan Class and it’s Sairaorg level hard work. Not to mention the expensive food and resources to go with it too.</p><p>These people can’t afford it at all. This is also a reason why these people have so few strong devils coming from within their ranks.</p><p>Lucifer and the Original Satans carried out dealings in souls which would have easily increased the powers of these devils at a fast pace but that was no longer allowed. A normal soul would pay around the same as 10,000 deals. This was also considering that the deals are of decent value too.</p><p>This made the speed of growth of Devils very slow.</p><p>This combined with the innate laziness and sense of superiority of devils, especially those who are especially gifted with stronger bloodlines, like the Old Satan Faction, they stagnated their growth even more while the few like Serafall and the others who trained became much stronger than the Original Satan’s Descendants. Sirzechs and Ajuka are an exception to this rule as even without training they would have been at least twice as strong as a Peak Satan if not ten times by my estimate.</p><p>This however doesn’t discount the potential of these low class devils who were never mentioned in the books.</p><p>Anyways, redirecting my thoughts back to what I came here for. This place is also a base made by Ophelia.</p><p>We walked to a rundown shop in town and Desmond talked softly to the shopkeeper who then directed us to the back of the shop.</p><p>The back of the shop had a room with a trapdoor under the carpet hidden with magic.</p><p>Normally opening such a door would show someone a wine cellar but if the right code and a certain magic circle is used, the door becomes a passage, or to be more precise, a lift.</p><p>“This is pretty cool. If I remember correctly, such a thing is also used in the stations which brings travellers from the human world, right?”</p><p>“Yes Master. This one however has codes instead of pass cards. These codes are directly passed by Milady when she wants someone here. The reinforcements of the wards are done by Lady Helena using the Dantalion wards and thus no one can teleport here except the ones registered by her. Even I haven’t been allowed this privilege and only your direct subordinates will have this power. I have been instructed to lead you to Lady Helena who will register your magic here so that you can teleport here directly. You can then allow anyone inside. This was also the reason why we had to take this meandering route instead of directly teleporting.”</p><p>I nodded my head while the lift brought us hundreds of meters underground until I felt a shift in space.</p><p>“A new dimension?”</p><p>“Yes Master.”</p><p>Wow. Ophelia really went all out. I guess this was also the place that Helena worked the most to make. It is understandable that space magic was used so blatantly with the Dantalion’s powers over space. I haven’t seen Ophelia’s ability but even when she is not as strong as Gretel, her control and understanding of her Clan Trait is phenomenal. It is easily deserving of her title of ‘The Smartest Woman in the Underworld’.</p><p>The new dimension is like a town itself. The size is not too big but it is enough for a middle sized town to easily exist here. The place has a construction team working even now as they rapidly make buildings everywhere.</p><p>The main area has already been constructed. It consists of the main residential area, hospital, labs, training areas as well as prisons.</p><p>The other areas will be for the people who will work here.</p><p>We walk towards the Hospital while Desmond explains everything to me.</p><p>The Dimension Lost user carrying Ingvild behind us.</p><p>The ones at the gate of the hospital were Ophelia and Helena.</p><p>“Master” the two greeted.</p><p>I nodded back to them. “Is the room ready?”</p><p>“Yes Master. Please follow us.” Ophelia led the way and Helena walked beside me while Desmond and the last devil followed carrying Ingvild.</p><p>“Would you like me to register your magic in the barrier Master?”</p><p>“Please do. I will send Gretel and Vienna to this place later, make sure that they are received and registered as well. The time is near.”</p><p>“Yes Master.”</p><p>“By the way, has everyone else been registered?”</p><p>“Yes Master. There are four bases of this capacity in the Underworld at different places. It is being managed by Lady Ophelia, Miss Victoria, Lady Cleria and Lady Alicia. I am unable to leave my home for long periods of time and thus cannot manage the base. I apologise for that.”</p><p>“Don’t. You have already done more than I could ask for. Even teaching Gretel over the connection. This is already beyond anything I was hoping for at this point. I have seen the barriers and you have done a remarkable job here. After the attack is over, the barriers will be reinforced using the Dimension Lost. You should spend more time with your family. Being absent for long periods might make someone notice your absence. That would be more problematic.”</p><p>“It won’t really matter, Master. I have always taken long time alone during important research. My family is used to it and my elder brother Lord Dantalion is someone who supports me in my pursuits. He won’t be angry with it.” she assured me with a smile and her feelings clearly showed her love for her family.</p><p>It seems that the Dantalion House is quite close to each other. At least the main house is.</p><p>“In that case I won’t insist but do take care of yourself.”</p><p>“Thank you Master. To answer your previous question. Everyone directly marked by you has been registered to the barrier. The only ones allowed inside here are the ones who have signed the contracts so there are no chances of them disclosing anything. As for the raw materials, they have been obtained by the various business ventures of Lady Alicia and Lady Ophelia throughout the world under different names. The collection of materials can never be tracked back to our group at all. We even made sure to take materials from the stocks of the construction companies under us throughout the world just in case. The data was erased after the transfer.”</p><p>“Very well. What is the status of the experiments and subject collection I had asked for?”</p><p>“The collection of criminals of different races has progressed quite well. The research on the Sleeping Disease however is not something positive. We haven’t been able to find anything about it. We already have 32 subjects but there has been no progress.”</p><p>“Ingvild here is also suffering from the same disease. She however will wake up in around eight to ten years due to her Sacred Gear’s awakening. It might also be due to her Demonic Power growing. You are allowed to observe her but do not do any experiments on her. Only observing. If that can help your research further, it's good, if not, then no problem either. I will be taking the matter in my own hands after I arrive. As for Ingvild, she will be cured by me when I mark her in a year.”</p><p>“A Sacred Gear’s Awakening can cure the Sleeping Sickness? No, that can’t be the reason. Maybe the amount of energy released gives the body a kick-start of sorts.”</p><p>“It might also be something connected with souls. The Sacred Gears are attached to the soul. Their awakening can affect the soul of the people as well. That might have some effect on the disease as well. On second thought, this idea is much more probable. All this time, all the research that I have heard about was general medicines and no one focused on the spiritual level at all. This side of the theory was never explored and might just have the answer.”</p><p>Helena thought for a while and then answered. “It’s not that it was not proposed but the souls of Devils hold many secrets of the House they belong to and permission to study that aspect never passed. The major dissenters of this approach were the Great King Faction and the Satans couldn’t take any steps and earn their ire for a bunch of sick people. It was never carried out and the idea was dropped soon after.”</p><p>The Great King Faction, as expected.</p><p>“Yes. I remember the argument. Ajuka Beelzebub wanted to continue the research but was heavily opposed. Even Zekram himself appeared and stated his opinion against the bill. It caused quite a lot of ruckus but ultimately not many of the stronger Houses had sick members and thus no one really cared leading to the bill to be dropped.” Ophelia explained from the side.</p><p>“Continue the research on the soul. Also try to recreate the drug itself. I want to see how the Great King dances when his own behind is on fire.”</p><p>“Master….you….”</p><p>“I am just preparing for eventualities. Even if we want to live in peace, the greatest hurdle will be the Great King faction and Zekram. The Satans can be managed. I have more than one way of handling that. I just want a way to curb the arrogance of the Great King faction without any kind of threat to ourselves.”</p><p>“Will you be researching the disease yourself Master?” Helena asked intrigued.</p><p>I had given her the nerfed Mad Doctor and she knew that I had a stronger version of the power. She had progressed extremely fast since gaining the skill.</p><p>“I will. Medicine and Drug research will be a major source of our future development. There are only so many Stray Devils for us to steal powers from. A Super Devil has two hundred and fifty times the Demonic Power of that of a Low Ultimate Class Devil. Where do you think we will find so many Ultimate Class or High Class Devils to make a Super Devil? The only way is training and research. Training will still be a slower method. I know for sure that within a decade, Gretel, Vienna and I can reach the level of a Super Devil even without any extra power from others. The same cannot be said for my other direct subordinates.”</p><p>I saw the stunned looks on the other people who were staring at me completely gobsmacked.</p><p>“What? Surprised? I did remove all your limits after all. As long as you continue training, you will continue to grow. No limits at the Peak Satan Class. Not even ten times Satan Class will be a limit. That said, this accumulation can take a lot of time. I don’t want my subordinates to die for me….I want them to live for me and that….takes strength. All this is only preparation for that.”</p><p>The stunned girls slowly gained their bearings back and Helena asked almost stammering, “Master….you….our limits are removed? How? I mean we haven’t felt anything different since.”</p><p>“I have my ways. Anyways, back to the topic. The research will focus on Enhancement Drugs and various other medicines to both heal and increase the power of our people.”</p><p>The group didn’t question any further.</p><p>“Heal? Is it like the healing of the Phenex Tears maybe?”</p><p>“It can be similar, it can be different. I won’t say no to that either. I want medicine that can be prepared without relying on any one house so that it cannot be used as the political capital of a single house and freely used for our people. I do have some ideas. We will continue the research further when I am here. The next part will be the research on poisons and disease causing viruses which can affect other species as well as the devils.”</p><p>“Diseases? Biological Weapons?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>The atmosphere quieted down a lot after this reveal.</p><p>“It is the most secure way to carry out assassinations. I don’t want anyone to spread a pandemic. Just something that can target someone and achieve a result. It will only be used when we have an antidote too. Normal poisons can lead to suspicion of murders but diseases are generally considered as accidents. The Great King Faction has been using the Devil’s Sleeping sickness for quite a while. It’s about time they got a taste of their own medicine.”</p><p>Ingvild was laid on the bed and all the instruments were connected to her.</p><p>The doctors soon arrived when called by Ophelia. Our conversation was however shielded by Ophelia and thus no one could hear anything except those inside the barrier.</p><p>While the doctors checked her, Helena took me to the place that controlled the barriers and registered my energy signature in it.</p><p>With a few more discussions and further instructions on what to do regarding the attack on the Russia base in a week, I left.</p><p>It is almost time.</p><p><strong>- Scene Change –</strong></p><p>I looked towards the empty room and counted inside my head.</p><p>Today is finally the day.</p><p>The day of the attack on the Russia base and the day of my first show.</p><p>Gretel has already sent Vienna to Ophelia and she will be staying there. The tracker on Gretel and my marks had been transferred over to a couple of butlers who were sent to spy on us.</p><p>And that’s when it happened. I sensed the shift in dimension. Dimension Lost was at work. Gretel sensed it too. She was more sensitive than even me to the changes in space.</p><p>“Master!”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>I made a shadow clone and put an illusion on it making it look like Vienna.</p><p>“You will stay here Gretel. In case someone asks, you will say that you are trying to break the barrier to call for reinforcements. Just in case, put a barrier around the base. Keep Vienna by your side. As for the rest, you already know it.”</p><p>“Yes Master.”</p><p>Sure enough, the other devils sensed the change and sirens and alarms went off at the same moment throughout the entire base. A knock was heard on my door.</p><p>“Young Lord. We have been attacked.” The maid’s voice cried out.</p><p>I gave a slight hug to Gretel and went ahead.</p><p>The maid outside was pale white from the fear.</p><p>I simply walked towards the main gathering area while instructing the people. “Call for Lord Bune and Lord Paimon as well as the rest of the staff in the gathering area. Be there in ten minutes. I will put a barrier up till then.”</p><p>The servants ran as soon as the command was finished.</p><p><em>“My Lord, when do we attack?”</em> I heard Cleria’s voice on the other end.</p><p><em>“Hold it for a while. I am putting a barrier up. Make a show but do not break it.”</em></p><p><em>“Very well my Lord.”</em></p><p>I reached the main gathering area and in front of me there were around two thousand devils of Ultimate class and below, all gathered there in lines.</p><p>The High Class Devils occupying the front and the Mid Class the back with both Gregory Bune and Lord Paimon taking the lead.</p><p>“Young Lord, there is an enemy attack.” Gregory rushed up to me as soon as I arrived.</p><p>“I know. Did you get the numbers?”</p><p>He nodded back and began the report, “There are around eight Ultimate Class Devils and over two hundred High Class Devils and around a thousand Mid Class. The main problem however are the Sacred Gear users. There are monsters occupying the front lines. These monsters according to some of the researchers are the products of the Longinus, Annihilation Maker. In addition to it, we are also locked inside this alternate space by what we presume to be another one of the top class Longinus Dimension Lost. We have no idea if the enemy has any more Sacred Gear users or Longinus but these two alone put us at a backfoot. Until we can find and take out the user of the Annihilation Maker, we will be facing an endless attack of monsters and this task in itself is near impossible with the arrival of Dimension Lost.” He was sweating buckets of sweat. I guess the last minute plan to use Annihilation Maker really got the ball rolling and made the entire situation worse for the defending party.</p><p>“I have asked Gretel to put up a barrier and I myself have put one up to hold them back for the time being. I will be facing the enemy Ultimate Class directly while Gretel will take care of the Barrier. You will follow me while Lord Paimon will try to manage the base and take out any rebels that may emerge within?”</p><p>“Rebels, Young Lord?”</p><p>I looked back at the man with a deadpan, “We are being attacked by devils and I can recognize some of them as former Old Satan Faction people. Do you really think there is a chance of there being no spies among our ranks? They even prepared enough Ultimate Class Devils to fight us and even two Longinus to hold us back and keep us locked in. It is already evident that they have a mole among us. Can you guarantee that they won’t attack or start a rebellion inside when we are out there fighting?”</p><p>With each word I spoke, he began sweating more and more but I felt a twinge of happiness within as well.</p><p>So he is the assassin.</p><p>“Pay attention. Let me talk to the people.” He nodded and went back.</p><p>I walked up to the stage and looked at the gathered crowd. The crowd looked a mess and were extremely agitated, not paying attention to me.</p><p>Well, time to grab their attention.</p><p>A burst of Conqueror’s Haki ran through the entire place.</p><p>It was strong enough for people to go weak in their knees but not to lose consciousness. It however was good enough to grab the attention of the crowd.</p><p>The crowd quieted down in an instant. Gregory took this opportunity to rush forward and shout, “The Young Lord will speak to everyone. Be quiet and pay attention.” Turning back towards me, he continued, “Young Lord please.”</p><p>I walked to the front and the crowd clapped and bowed.</p><p>I hope this speech works as well as it did for the one I am copying. Taking a deep breath I started.</p><p>“My brothers, my sisters….my friends.” The crowd quieted down as the ‘Bewitching Voice’ trait worked in tandem with the Charisma of the Essence of the King. “The gift of your applause is not for me….No. It is for yourselves.”</p><p>The audience listened quietly and I continued, “We are here today because we are craving….because the old ways serve us no longer. We came here today because we want something new….something different.</p><p>At these words a wave of murmurs spread out in the audience. Even Gregory and Lord Paimon looked at me incredulously.</p><p>“It is said that we hate humans, reincarnated devils, the fallen, angels and the youkai.”</p><p>A wave of agreement was the reply.</p><p>“But I do not hate them.” The agreement stopped. “No….I do not. For I do not fight out of hatred. I see them as not lesser….but other. Not worthless….but of other value. Not disposable, but of a different disposition.” Seeing the stunned and even some hostile looks on the faces of the crowd, I smiled, “What confused?”</p><p>Gregory nodded back, “Young Lord, what do you mean?”</p><p>“Let me explain. But first….everyone here. Do answer a question for me. Who was the first Reincarnated Devil?”</p><p>The crowd fell into silence and different replies came.</p><p>Some said human, some said the servants of the fake Satans.</p><p>“It might be one of Ajuka Astaroth’s servants maybe?” Lord Paimon replied unsure.</p><p>“Is it? It seems that your history is quite weak, Lord Paimon. Teacher, would you like to give it a try?” I looked towards Gregory.</p><p>Lord Paimon’s expression bristled with anger but he reigned it in very quickly while Bune looked contemplative but replied after thinking for a while. “It might be some test subjects of the Evil Pieces.”</p><p>I shook my head. “The truth here is so obvious and yet people have forgotten it so quickly. The answer to the question is….Lilith.”</p><p>Eyes widened.</p><p>“Lilith, a human created by the Father of the Angels made into a Devil by Lucifer. Yes, my friends, The Mother of All Devils was a human and is and always will be a Reincarnated Devil.”</p><p>The shocked expressions are obvious but even with all these emotions, none of them could quite refute this statement.</p><p>“The Leviathan was made into a Devil from a Sea Serpent. The Asmodeus from a Demon and the same was the case with Beelzebub while Lucifer himself was an Angel before becoming a Devil. While all of them were strong, it is a fact that none of them were born Devils.”</p><p>The crowd went up in a panic and I let them stew in the tension of the situation. “I am not comparing the reincarnated humans or beasts to the Satans or Lilith. They have done too much for the Underworld, for our entire race for there to be any comparison. I have the blood of two of them flowing through my very being. No. What I am doing is trying to tell all of you that reincarnated devils are not abominations, not untouchables. They have their values. It is just that their value is different. And haven’t we all seen this value already?”</p><p>Now even the two Ultimate Class Devils looked confused.</p><p>“What exactly are you trying to say, Young Lord.”</p><p>“Isn’t it obvious teacher? I am talking about the numbers. The current government relied on these increased numbers to completely make us run into hiding for hundreds of years. The Reincarnated Devils with Sacred Gears are always as strong as Mid Class Devils and many of them easily become High Class Devils. Even the two devils outside in possession of Longinus….do you think they are all unworthy, of no value?”</p><p>The murmurs spread again.</p><p>I looked at them and smiled, “is it not proof enough that the army outside has us cornered inside our own base with numbers lower than ourselves and yet….and yet we stand in this place….worrying about the battle….worrying about our very lives. Tell me, are they still unworthy, are they still of no value?”</p><p>There were no answers and my words continued.</p><p>“They were at the forefront of the rebel armies in the Civil War and are now the private troops of each High Class Devil and above. Each one of them has fifteen pieces worth of potential in front of them as a shield while we all….while we all lie bare. Ask yourselves in your hearts that if all the Reincarnated Devils under the current government attacked us today, would we be able to win? Would we be able to survive? The answer my friends is ….no.”</p><p>The morale went all low and their voices died down, while I smiled inwardly.</p><p>“But does that mean we will give up?”</p><p>Some people looked up. Anger, pride, all the emotions and sins of the devils bursting up in a smoldering flame just for me to fan with my words.</p><p>“NO.”</p><p>“IF THEY THINK THAT THEY CAN CRUSH US SO EASILY, IF THEY THINK THEY CAN FORCE ME TO BOW, THEN I WILL SHOW THEM JUST HOW WRONG THEY ARE. I DAMIEN LUCIFER, REFUSE TO BOW. WILL YOU?”</p><p>The anger burst out and shouts of denials filled the place.</p><p>“TODAY I WILL FIGHT….AND I WILL FIGHT TILL THE END.” I sent out a burst of the Asmodeus’ Blue Flames until it surrounded the barrier cast by Gretel, completely making a firewall around the base. “I CANNOT PROMISE THAT EVERYONE WHO FIGHTS WITH ME WILL SURVIVE….BUT I DO PROMISE THAT THOSE WHO SIDE WITH ME….WILL WIN. I MAKE THIS DEAL WITH YOU, JOIN ME, GIVE ME ALL YOUR LOYALTY, HAVE FAITH IN ME AND FOLLOW ME WITH YOUR MIND, BODY, HEART AND SOUL….AND I PROMISE YOU THAT TODAY WE WILL WIN…. And when we do so, we will see a new tomorrow, the future of the Devil Race rewritten by us. Will you join me in this? And will you, my brothers….my sisters….my friends….make this Deal with the Devil?”</p><p>The crowd erupted.</p><p>The charisma from The King’s Essence and ‘Bewitching Voice’ driving their shame, helplessness and anger against their so-called enemy and ultimately to side with me.</p><p>The cries of yes and the number of deals I made kept on increasing while with my Observation Haki I observed the feelings of the people. The ones who accepted the deal instantly became completely subservient to me.</p><p>Soon enough almost everyone in the crowd had done so. The only ones I didn’t sense accepting the deal are Gregory and Paimon. I turned towards them and smiled, “So Lord Paimon, Teacher, will you be accepting my deal?”</p><p>The Conqueror’s fluctuating around me. They had sweat covering their foreheads.</p><p>“Yes….yes Young Lord….I accept.” Lord Paimon hurriedly replied.</p><p>“I will protect you with my life, Young Lord.” Gregory didn’t exactly accept.</p><p>Too bad.</p><p>I already have more than what I expected.</p><p>Now I just have to catch the attacker and then the final part of the show.</p><p>The Death of Damien Lucifer.</p><p><strong>- Cleria Belial –</strong></p><p>Cleria stood among the crowd of people cheering for the Young Lord. Everyone was singing praises and all falling deeply into the web of words spun by the one twelve year old kid whom they were all looking down on a few minutes ago.</p><p>She was brought in by the Young Lord along with her entire peerage to assist inside and take down the enemies that were left over. They had to show a scene of a fight after all.</p><p>Someone was trying to attack Vienna Lucifer.</p><p>Cleria had already seen the retribution that Damien had brought over the entire Old Satan Faction after Aria’s death. More than three thousand devils died in the attacks till now and the number of forces under Cleria had only been bolstered after every raid.</p><p>It was nothing like what happened today. This base would probably be the easiest capture yet.</p><p>She didn’t know if the one who was going to attack Vienna accepted the deal or not.</p><p>Now, that would be funny.</p><p>She walked towards the place she was told to while her peerage occupied their predetermined places as well.</p><p>Vienna was already in Ophelia’s care and today she was here to take care of two matters. First would be to disable anyone attacking the Vienna decoy and second to capture Lord Paimon.</p><p>She took a last look at the crowd who now had a completely different feel from before and a deep fear formed inside her as she thanked her luck that the Young Lord had taken a much….easier path when binding her.</p><p>Damien Lucifer had changed. She had always known that he was capable of great cruelty as well as great love but Aria’s death had changed something fundamental.</p><p>There are some incidents in life that shape a person’s entire personality. For Damien, Aria Lucifer’s death was one such incident.</p><p>He has since then become much more decisive in his way of dealing with people. Before this he had dealt with Katerea in the same way but he left her mind alone and that too was just for her to know and regret her decision of trying to tame the Devil.</p><p>These people however were all Old Satan Faction and no mercy was shown to them. All had only two paths, either submit or perish.</p><p>At such times she desperately wanted Damien to leave that place and live with her. Such a mentality is not good for a child. The only ones he keeps close to himself and really opens up to are Gretel and Vienna and even the directly bound subordinates while close still cannot get Damien to truly open up. And even those two children needed help.</p><p>Gretel would happily kill an entire country with a smile on her face if Damien ordered her to do so and Vienna….she was clinging to the one light she had in the world left for her.</p><p>While understandable that after such a loss, he would avoid getting close to other people easily, it is still not good for his mentality. She believed that the childish innocence of Lavinia and Shirone or the mischievous Kuroka might get through his defenses and make him open up a bit more.</p><p>She took her position in the room as she watched the clone of the Young Lord reading a book.</p><p>In her heart she wondered who the attacker would be and what end he would meet.</p><p>But one thing was for sure….the end won’t be good for the attackers.</p><p>__________________________________x__________________________________________________________________x________________________________</p><p><strong>Beta Reader: LuluViBritania(FF.N, SB and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th Britannian Emperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note :</strong></p><p><strong>Wow, this one took much much longer than I was thinking.

Other bases have been attacked as well and until we can fortify those, we need more people with us.” Shalba said the first thing after looking at the list of names I gave him. “Anyways, any reason to choose these three? I can understand Gregory Bune as he was your teacher but Octavius Paimon? I don’t think you have had any meetings with him unless I am mistaken?”</p><p>“Lord Paimon is my Mind Magic Teacher Ophelia Paimon’s father. The Paimon’s Trait of the ‘Bewitching Voice’ is very useful in calming people in distressing situations which is something I might need in case of attacks. He also has experience as a frontline general and can take command of the defending troops in case I am engaged in a fight. Gregory Bune, by his own claim, while a good fighter, is not a capable general. That said I am more familiar with his working habit and can work well with both Gretel and him as a team.” Too bad I can’t get the third person in the list. He would have been a great addition to my side according to whatever plans Ophelia had for him but well, next time.</p><p>As for Octavius Paimon, he needs to either join my side or die in this attack. Ophelia expressly requested it. He has been a constant terror on Ophelia. It was because of him that Ophelia was tied to the Old Satan Faction and cannot leave at will. She wants him away from her brother Ace and I think I can work it out quite easily.</p><p>“Hmm….a well thought out choice. Very well, you can take the people and teleport to our base in Russia. I will leave the rest to you.” he patted my shoulder and left.</p><p>I gave the list to Shalba’s assistant who was left behind and went ahead to make the required contracts.</p><p>A two month posting.</p><p>Right around the time for my one year goal.</p><p><strong>- Scene Change –</strong></p><p>Russia is….cold.</p><p>The base was obviously in an alternate dimension under heavy wards but the outer regions of Russia were generally avoided by the Church and the Fallen alike. It was known as the place where Devils held an upper hand during the Great War and it had successfully repelled many attempts to take over the area.</p><p>This area was currently under the Houses who support the Old Satan Faction….namely the supporters of the previous Beelzebub.</p><p>The Dimension was warded quite well against detection but not that well against attacks. I might not have an expertise in Warding but Gretel has a comprehensive knowledge about any and all techniques on the matter from the Dantalion’s Libraries. The Space Affinity made the House Dantalion a pioneer in Warding, especially the ones which involved alternate dimensions.</p><p>In fact, the current Rating Game’s arenas were also based on the same spells….just a dumbed down version of it considering the people who do normally are not Dantalions. The matches between the top level Rating Games are always held in Dimensions made by the Dantalion Devils because normal ones wouldn’t be able to withstand the power.</p><p>“Cleria.”</p><p><em>“Yes, My Lord.”</em></p><p>“Report….what is the status of the ones you are preparing to send here?”</p><p><em>“We only have four Ultimate Class Devils right now and all of them are my peerage members. Two other Ultimate Class Devils are from the ones who we turned into us in the attacks. They are both Low Ultimate Class. We have Peak High Class Devils but even if we push them, the most we can do is make them Low Ultimate Class in a month and a half at best. We can arrange eight Ultimate Class devils that way but they will be of no use against you if you want to show a strong fight but even that would be pushing it. We just don’t have enough resources and the Old Satan Faction have started to investigate us fervently. We can’t hunt more Stray Devils freely to collect more power.”</em></p><p>“Hmm….I would prefer if things go according to my plan but still make sure that the ones who come here are prepared to die. As for the strength of the attacking force, get the two to Mid Ultimate Class if possible, and use the Dimension Lost on the expendable one after making them sign the Suicide Contract. We need a strong opposition to truly put some pressure on the people. If possible use the Annihilation Maker on the other and give them a few doses of Chaos Drive drug. I want them to use Balance Breaker in the fight. Make sure the whole area is isolated when I tell you to.”</p><p><em>“The Longinuses? My Lord, are you sure?”</em> she asked suddenly in an incredulous tone.</p><p>“The Suicide Contract will make sure we don’t lose it. Just do what I say. I don’t want to take any chances here. This might be the last play I make here before I leave the Old Satan Faction.”</p><p><em>“….Yes My Lord.”</em></p><p>A month and a half until the attack.</p><p>I checked the room for any surveillance and put up a few barriers of my own and then turned towards my sole companion in the room.</p><p>“Gretel.”</p><p>“Yes Master.”</p><p>“Ward the place. I want it so that no one can send any information from or to this place without my notice. I will get the books and information about the subject to hide your knowledge about the Dantalion Wards. I want every room, every corner of this dimension mapped.”</p><p>“Yes Master.”</p><p>There is a high chance that this place will be rigged by the lackeys of Rizevim who were sent along with the group.</p><p>Now though, I have a reason to simply torture and kill them if I find them sending information behind my back on the guise of them being spies.</p><p>Vienna is sleeping in the other room and resting.</p><p>Razevan has left us alone since my little outburst at Aria’s funeral.</p><p>He made no efforts to contact Vienna, directly or through any servant but most of the time he has been wandering to places that I have no idea about. I had no way to investigate him without causing problems for myself and I have more than enough on my plate as it is.</p><p>I finally got the chance I was looking for for over a year now.</p><p>The chance to roam around free without being tracked and I had more than a few things I had to take care of.</p><p>The first being….choosing a weapon of my choice.</p><p><strong>- Scene Change –</strong></p><p>I walked down the dirt road towards the corner of the forest. My goal is the house there or more precisely the girl in the house.</p><p>The entire forest is calm and has an extremely peaceful environment. Despite the whole plot….or a majority of the plot of the series being in Japan, this is my first time in this place.</p><p>I am accompanied by Antonio Amy, one of the two Ultimate Class Devils we had managed to turn to our side. He was the one chosen to use the Dimension Lost in the fight that I was organizing. There was a certain amount of time provided for him to get used to the Sacred Gear before the attack in a month.</p><p>I brought him with me to simply shield this area and prevent unwanted distractions.</p><p>“Young Lord, this is the place. The girl you have been enquiring about is inside there.”</p><p>I nodded my head and walked inside.</p><p>Almost as soon as I knocked on the door, I felt something lock on to me. My Observation Haki couldn’t detect anything. No detection spells gave me any indication about what this was. It was completely instinctual. The Observation Haki makes people’s instincts extremely sharp. It was only due to my knowledge about who or rather what I was facing made me push Rizevim’s Sacred Gear Canceller Skill to use. The feeling disappeared as soon as I used it.</p><p>So this was the reason she was isolated from everyone. It was understandable to some extent. Sad….but still understandable.</p><p>What was not understandable was their attitude towards this girl who had nothing to do with it in the first place. She was born with it without any choice in the matter, so it was not fair to hate her.</p><p>The door opened and I saw a girl around the same age as Gretel, looking at me. She was petite, slightly smaller than her own age. Her eyes had slight dark circles around them, an indication of her current health.</p><p>“Are....you.. here to try to kill me too?” came a soft but feeble voice from inside.</p><p>Despite knowing the whole story, I couldn’t help but feel a twinge in my heart.</p><p>There are sad stories everywhere. I need to harden my heart and deal with it. This was not time for getting lost in such thoughts. If everything goes as I want to, then this girl might have a better life after today.</p><p>“No. I am here to offer you a chance to live.” I spoke softly, trying not to scare the girl away, although I don’t think she would be scared so easily. She was too depressed for that currently. After all, what kind of person opens the door to a would-be assassin?</p><p>She looked up, her eyes showing too much pain. Who knows how many times she has been told the same words….only to meet with a disappointing result at the end. It was understandable why she didn’t have even a glimmer of hope at my words….sad but yet understandable.</p><p>“Many have said the same and tried. If you feel like you can do something, I will not reject it.”</p><p>“I will not try anything….I WILL do it. What I am not sure is if you will be able to pay for it?”</p><p>“If you can make this….this stop, I can ask Ryota Onii-sama to pay for it. Beyond that I cannot say anything.” There was a hint of determination in her voice and the assurance that her brother would pay for it went a long way to show her confidence in the person.</p><p>Ryota Nakiri was the current heir of the Nakiri Clan of the Five Principal Clans and the first in line to inherit the Divine Spirit of the Oryuu.</p><p>He was also very close to his cousin and was extremely distressed when the Clan decided to isolate her and has been trying to find a way to help the girl since then.</p><p>“I don’t need anything from your brother. What I need is the same thing you want to get rid of, along with a promise that your Clan will not try to come after me or mine.”</p><p>Her eyes widened for a moment before she collected herself, “Are you sure? Can you remove it safely?”</p><p>“I am. Don’t you see that you cannot use it right now.” I pointed out to her.</p><p>It was quite easy to stop the Sacred Gear from being used after all.</p><p>My Observation Haki sensed her increased heart rate and for a moment I saw a ray of hope glimmer in her eyes. “Do it. I agree.”</p><p>Although I knew about it, I still couldn’t help but ask, “Are you sure you want to give it up? People all over the world, both humans or supernatural, would kill for this power. Would you just give it up and not even take a chance to be able to control it in the future?”</p><p>“Would you agree to it if I said that I won’t follow you. I won’t join your peerage. Will you still help me with it?” she asked looking directly into my eyes, no hint of anger or disgust shown in her face or even in her emotions.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Then what is there to talk about?”</p><p>True.</p><p>I kinda like this girl. Wish she could have joined me.</p><p>“Well in that case, here,” I gave her a contract, “Read this and see if you can agree to this. Sign it and we have a deal.”</p><p>She went through the contract without any more words.</p><p>“My life will belong to you in case someone from my clan tried to attack you or yours with the purpose of taking revenge for this.” She raised an eyebrow towards me.</p><p>“I would like to keep my assurances. Don’t worry. I have no interest in making you my slave or anything like that. What I need is your Sacred Gear. This contract is only so that my identity and powers remain a secret. The rest is just an assurance for my close ones. As for your Clan, I am not trying to brag or anything….but….even if your Oryuu were to fight me at its peak, I can still assure myself of a way to win. I am not worried. That said, if my loved ones are hurt, I will retaliate in the most brutal way possible….so let’s spare the bloodshed with a simple measure.”</p><p>“What will you do if you are attacked even after my clan warns its people about it? After all we can only say but cannot control the minds of all the members.”</p><p>“A fair question. Hmm….let’s say, I will negotiate for that person’s life with your brother in return for yours. He is going to be the Oryuu’s host after all.”</p><p>She looked at me for a moment before taking a deep breath, cutting her finger and signing the contract with blood.</p><p>My mouth opened a bit.</p><p>“I had a pen.”</p><p>….</p><p>Her mouth hung open as well.</p><p>My Observation Haki told me that she probably thinks that I cannot read the room in the atmosphere.</p><p>I could….but that was so….so unnecessary and….so unsanitary.</p><p>The contract however didn’t care about the sanitation and was completed.</p><p>I had the Telos Karma stored inside the contract and her memories regarding my identity and powers locked away permanently.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>The one I was after was Telos Karma. The one aspect of everything that I needed on my side….is Luck.</p><p>The Ultimate Karma.</p><p>The power to control Luck to such an extent that it even allows humans to kill Gods. The power that can make Ajuka Beelzebub, that absolute beast of calculative perfection’s spells go awry.</p><p>I don’t have ridiculous plot armor like the protagonists of anime but that doesn’t mean that I can’t take my own measures regarding it.</p><p>Luck is one aspect that can change the course of a whole battle in a single instant….and I need that instant on MY side.</p><p>This is the power that might give me the edge. One moment to get an attack in and I can turn the whole fight into my palm.</p><p>Technically Boosted Gear is a wonderful power and could help me immensely. But I have the Essence of the Archmage and I could very well copy the Boost Magic. It would become easier to use as my soul grows stronger. I know I can use Divide if I work on it.</p><p>Annihilation Maker is another great choice that can give me the edge in a fight. Matched with my ever growing Demonic Power, it can be a nightmare for almost anyone to handle.</p><p>But manipulating Probability is extremely difficult to learn. Mastering it to the level of Telos Karma is even more difficult and just as time consuming.</p><p>That said….there was never a rule that said I could only have one Sacred Gear now was there?.</p><p>“Then with this finished, I declare you free….Momiji Nakiri. Rejoice in your freedom.”</p><p>With my words said, I left the place in a flash.</p><p>I have to return back soon.</p><p><strong>- Scene Change –</strong></p><p>It has been one week since the incident. I finally have in hand the best Sacred Gear for me.</p><p>The warding of this base has been completed in a way that Gretel can drop the entire warding scheme in a matter of moments if she wanted.</p><p>Finally things are looking a bit good. Now I just need to wait for Cleria to get ready for the attack.</p><p>“Dummy, come with me. I have something to show you.” a very excited gremlin jumped on me and dragged me from my couch towards….somewhere.</p><p>“What is it, Vi? I need to inspect the place and see if the work is going well.”</p><p>“This is very important. It won’t take much time.” she insisted and I went along with her.</p><p>We came outside Gretel’s room and I looked weirdly at the one dragging me.</p><p>“Now close your eyes. Oh and no peeking….or using Observation Haki either.”</p><p>….</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>I closed my eyes and she pulled me by my hand to the room.</p><p>“Now open your eyes.”</p><p>I did and what greeted me was a brightly decorated room with a cake with twelve candles in between.</p><p>Ah….I had forgotten my own birthday.</p><p>“HAPPY BIRTHDAY DUMMY!.”</p><p>“Happy Birthday Master.”</p><p>Vi and Gretel greet me together.</p><p>“Come on, cut the cake already, Dummy. I’m hungry.”</p><p>“Lady Vi.”</p><p>“B-but….”</p><p>I was dragged towards the cake. It looked just like the cakes Aria made on our birthdays. For all three of us.</p><p>I looked towards Gretel. She has been working extra hard since Aria passed away, just to maintain a sense of normality in our lives.</p><p>I had completely immersed myself in my plans and studies to bring us out of that place and had in a way neglected our time together. I didn’t spend as much time with Vi and Gretel but the two never complained. For an adult, this would be understandable but Vi is not even ten years old right now and Gretel is barely fourteen and yet they are so understanding and supporting.</p><p>Now I feel like an idiot all of a sudden.</p><p>“How is the cake, Dummy? Awesome right. Gretel made it but I am the one who decorated it. Now come on blow the candles and cut the cake. Fast.”</p><p>I smiled and nodded towards her before embracing her. With my other hand I took Gretel’s hand and brought the surprised girl in the hug too.</p><p>Yeah, this feels much better.</p><p>“Master?”</p><p>I put a finger on her lips and she quieted down. Vi’s grip tightened on us and slowly Gretel also relaxed herself in my embrace. None of us spoke anything and stayed like that for a while.</p><p>A while later I cut the cake and fed the gremlin, my cute maid and enjoyed a peaceful time among us.</p><p><strong>- Scene Change –</strong></p><p>I heard the knock on the room and looked at the door.</p><p>My Observation Haki already having identified the person.</p><p>Gretel looked up from the side of the bed wanting to get up while Vi was asleep. I had dragged her to sleep with us because Vi wanted to spend some time together. I wanted it too.</p><p>I waved her to rest with Vienna while I myself got up to the door.</p><p>It was the maid.</p><p>“Young Lord, I-Its Lord Razevan. He wishes to talk with you and is requesting your presence.” She stuttered a bit.</p><p>My fingers twitched slightly. The maid was afraid, no doubt already aware of my relationship with the person and was worried that I would nuke her too.</p><p>“Okay. Lead him to the guest room. I will be there in a moment.”</p><p>“Yes My Lord.” She bowed immediately and almost ran from the place.</p><p>I closed the door, many thoughts running through my mind.</p><p>“Master, should I?” Gretel called out from behind me.</p><p>I looked back at her and shook my head. “No. Stay here with Vienna. If I give an order, take her and escape. Go to Alicia’s base.”</p><p>She looked a little reluctant but agreed nonetheless.</p><p>I changed into my formal clothes and left the room.</p><p>Why would Razevan come here and why now of all times?</p><p>Is he here by himself or is Rizevim pulling the strings?</p><p>I soon reached the guest room. The maid was standing outside the room. On seeing me arrive, she bowed to me and opened the room.</p><p>I entered the room and closed it behind myself.</p><p>Inside the room Razevan was sitting on the couch with an unnaturally serious face. Not the usual cowardly one but a serious face with similar emotions that were verified by my Observation Haki.</p><p>He looked around the room and then began setting privacy barriers. “Set up any barrier that you can. I believe that these discussions will be a little noisy.”</p><p>I watched quietly. Setting barriers? Does he want to assassinate me?</p><p><em>“Gretel, be on full guard. Something is not right here. Keep checking the surrounding areas for barriers and as soon as you get a hit of one being put around the location, run. Do not wait for me. I leave Vi’s safety to you.”</em> I called out in my mind.</p><p><em>“Yes Master”</em></p><p>I went on and set up a few barriers with some concealed traps inside.</p><p>With everything done, he took a seat on the couch back once more and then signaled me to take a seat as well.</p><p>And that’s when the first attack came.</p><p>“I want you to do whatever you did to Katerea and Ophelia, to me as well so that you will believe whatever I say.”</p><p>I stilled for a moment, my Occlumency working overtime to maintain my expressions.</p><p>“That trick only works when the other party is not an Empath. Frankly speaking, it is more suspicious if you show no emotions than if you had an outburst. Your tricks to hide your emotions are good but there are a lot of holes in it. Did you really think that Devils, especially ones from top of the Underworld are that much of a fool? Even without empathy, your muscle movements, breathing and even heartbeats are enough for a trained person to see through your guise. You are suppressing your emotion or distracting yourself from it. That however doesn’t erase the emotions all together. Those emotions are still there.” He went on a rant while my head was running through the implications of those words.</p><p>Occlumency is a skill that I have more or less self-created. It is something that I later refined with Mind Magic from Ophelia but that wasn’t until I was eight years old that I started working on it. I made barely any progress until the age of nine years give or take six months after I had devised the Shadow Clones who bombarded me with Legilimency probes that I had to defend against.</p><p>I still had almost seven to seven and a half years in the place with barely passable defenses. Could it be that my mind was read?</p><p>No.</p><p>I would have at least felt anything wrong with it.</p><p>Even if I didn’t, they wouldn’t have let me act that freely if they had any idea about ‘any’ of my skills.</p><p>Empathy however is not something I was expecting. It was not even in the list of things I was considering.</p><p>Occlumency was not a skill from my Essences. It is something that I have created myself and thus there could be problems in it.</p><p>Whether he truly knew what was wrong or was just shooting in the dark was to be seen though.</p><p>He took a gulp of his drink and then looked at me for a reply.</p><p>“Did you come here simply to give me this speech?”</p><p>“No. I have work to do, that’s why I want you to do whatever you did to Katerea and Ophelia to me so that you can trust what I am going to say next.”</p><p>I merely looked at him impassively though.</p><p>He sighed and then continued, “I could sense the change in emotions of Ophelia Piamon towards you after the first day she met you. I had some idea about what Rizevim had sent her to you for. Her emotions were also in line with that goal. You were also wary of her because I could sense your unease throughout the time since you were informed about the Mind Magic lessons. But as soon as she met you, there was a complete change in her emotions to downright worship towards you. It is obvious that you did something because you were suddenly extremely comfortable in her presence too. The same was the case with Katerea. She, while didn’t worship you, was extremely afraid of you. It was like you held her life in your palms or something even more. As far as I know Katerea Leviathan, she would rather die than suffer a defeat so you must have done something to forcibly control her. Blackmail won’t work. She is too stubborn and prideful for that. So the only option I can think of is Mind Control somehow. I want you to use whatever you can to assure that I am not lying or there is no way you will believe me.”</p><p>I stared at the man completely slack-jawed.</p><p>That a simple Empathy skill could fuck my plans so bad is not something I had imagined. All of his words were true according to my Observation Haki. I couldn’t even imagine what consequences this would have to our escape plan or if this was all a play for Rizevim or him maybe.</p><p>“Why are you even talking about all this? If you can read my emotions so easily then you should have known that I would kill you the first chance I can get away with, so what is even the point of all this?” I asked a little confused.</p><p>I am prepared to kill him right now but I still want to know why.</p><p>“Are you thinking about killing?” He simply raised an eyebrow before continuing. “Sure. I don’t mind that. Still I want you to hear what I have to say first. As for killing me.” A massive burst of power exploded out from him and before I realized it, I was in the corner of the room, several barriers in between us and the Flames of Asmodeus ready to attack at the moment’s notice.</p><p>My heartbeat picked by as I saw his power increase from High Ultimate Class to High Satan Class in a single instant. No. It was slightly more than High Satan Class and was approaching Peak Satan Class.</p><p>That is around five times stronger than me in terms of sheer Demonic Power. That was almost as strong as Serafall Leviathan from what I have heard.</p><p>“Members of House Lucifer have on average four times more Demonic Power than other Devils. Almost all Satan House members achieve Low Satan Class Demonic Powers by the time they are two hundred years old, without any kind of training. That is one of the reasons why they are considered the strongest bloodlines around. I am talking about bloodlines, not stronger devils. Super Devils are exceptions. If Shalba, Katerea or Creuserey had trained themselves, they could have easily achieved Peak Satan Class without any problems. Their elder siblings were such devils. They however were too hung up on their ancestor’s glory to bother training. That said, even they have talents in many other fields. We don’t just waste hundreds of years doing nothing. Every devil of the Satan Clans is born with enough potential to reach Peak Satan Class….minimum.”</p><p>This time I was paying too much attention to his words as one after one my assumptions of this world were being broken down. Observation Haki was my most used skill along with Occlumency. It was the first skill I had developed and have been working on even now.</p><p>For it to be fooled so easily, was a major blow to my confidence.</p><p>“There is more than one way to fool a sensory skill. Don’t rely on just one. If you see someone’s power, always prepare for at least four times more strength. That way even if they were hiding, you will have a chance to escape. Anyways, are you ready? I don’t have much time. My disappearance and appearance in this place will be noticed very quickly. I want to make sure the talks end before that.”</p><p>“How? How did you do that?”</p><p>He sighed again but explained nonetheless.</p><p>“The House Trait of Lucifer is varied. Every member normally has a different Trait and it is almost impossible to guess who has what Trait that said I have discovered that there is one common fact for all these powers. They are all things for which Lucifer was famous for.”</p><p>“Wasn’t his power to reject the Miracles of the Divine?”</p><p>“No. That was ‘one’ of his powers. ‘The Denial of Divine’ is the power that Lucifer was most well-known for because he could render almost any divine attack useless. That is how Lucifer and the other Satans fought his Father to a standstill despite the other party being vastly stronger than them. It is why he is known as the one who rebelled despite there being numerous Fallen Angels who had done the same. What Rizevim has is a severely watered down version of that power. Lucifer on the other hand had many other powers and legends associated with him as well. He is after all the second most famous individual in the Abrahamic religion second only to his father. I too have a Trait similar to one of his titles. I call it ‘The Prince of Lies’.”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>He sighed once more and indicated to me to sit. I looked at him for a moment but decided to do the same. There was no point. If we fight, I would have to self-destruct to be able to take him down with me. Let’s see what he has planned first.</p><p>“Lucifer was called ‘The Father of Lies’. He had the power to look through everyone’s inner feelings while hiding himself in his lies. My power comes from that. I can see anyone’s inner feelings while lying without being caught. My power that was visible was actually a Lie from me. I can hide the truth behind my lie. The concept behind a lie can be stretched quite a lot. Devils have the power to train their Traits to slightly manipulate the concepts. Like the Bael’s Trait of ‘The Power of Destruction’ if trained and powered enough can erase anything. I have trained my Trait to lie to the world around me. I don’t have enough power to go beyond this right now.”</p><p>It was as if my whole being shivered when I heard this Trait.</p><p>What the actual fuck?</p><p>Is that even normal?</p><p>I mean even ‘The Power of Destruction’ is just a joke in front of this.</p><p>Conceptual Erasure requires extremely large powers. The only such being in this world is Shiva, The God of Destruction of the Hindu Pantheon, One of the Trimurti. Even Sirzechs can only use just a fraction of that power in his true form at the cost of all his sanity and control during his transformation.</p><p>What even is the limit of this Trait?</p><p>Can it lie to the world itself to an extent like the Izanagi?</p><p>He did say that he was lying to the world to show his power as a High Ultimate Class instead of his true power.</p><p>“Why though? Why hide it? Your….”</p><p>“I will answer everything if you are sure that you can believe me.”</p><p>There is no way that I am letting him leave this place alive right now.</p><p><em>“Gretel, take Vienna and leave somewhere safe for now. Do not alert anyone of your disappearance. Do not go to Ophelia or Katerea however.”</em></p><p><em>“Master, is everything alright?”</em></p><p><em>“I don’t know Gretel….I really don’t know. I will be safe. You take care of Gretel till I return.”</em></p><p><em>“Master….”</em></p><p><em>“Gretel please….just….please.”</em></p><p>“I will agree to listen to you if you agree to speak only the truth while in this room, no half-truths, no twisted facts, just the plain truth, do we have a deal?” I asked him in a normal tone.</p><p>He looked at me for a moment before a look of realization came over him but before I could do anything, he agreed.</p><p>I am using my Essence’s powers directly instead of using any skills I have learned or created. His Trait might be able to lie to others but my Essences cannot be broken that simply. The Broker Essence even more so.</p><p>“Fascinating. It is like a binding on my very soul. Is you’re your Trait? A Deal with the Devil? Very Lucifer indeed.” He didn’t look stressed in any way and was talking casually. “I have bl-silver hair. Oh! So I can’t lie even with my Trait. I can see why Katerea would be so terrified of you. This does change a lot of things. Anyways, are you sure this method can make me speak the truth?”</p><p>“If this doesn’t do it, then I have no idea what will. I don’t really have many options with me though.”</p><p>He looked closely at me and sighed again. “You are prepared to go suicidal and take me down here. Are Vienna and Gretel both in this place?”</p><p>I didn’t reply at all.</p><p>“Doesn’t matter. I need to talk to you. That is the most important thing. First things first. I did not kill Aria.”</p><p>My heart almost stopped for a second before I noticed a hole in the statement. He must have read it from my emotions so he clarified it. “She actually committed suicide.”</p><p>….</p><p>My head went blank for a moment and I couldn’t reply at all.</p><p>He continued, “I have never once hit Aria in my whole life with an intent to harm her.”</p><p>At this point, I was beginning to worry if my Essence was even working.</p><p>“Wait. One more deal before the next statement.”</p><p>He raised an eyebrow at me but nodded nonetheless.</p><p>“From now and till the time you leave the room, your Trait of House Lucifer will be mine along with any other supernatural powers that you can use to lie, directly or indirectly and in return I will listen to your words. Deal?”</p><p>His mouth opened slightly. “That is….how even….” His eyes widened but he agreed nonetheless.</p><p>I felt the gush of power inside me as my Archmage Essence started to scan every part of the power and understand it.</p><p>I saw his hands shaking a little as he looked at himself, staring at his hand.</p><p>“DO NOT, I MEAN ABSOLUTELY DO NOT REVEAL THIS POWER TO ANYONE. IF YOU DO, MAKE SURE THEY CANNOT EVER REVEAL IT. This whole world will be after you out for blood if this is revealed.”</p><p>“I know. I am still prepared to kill you if your words do not convince me. I don’t have anyone I care about a hundred miles around this area. I am prepared to disintegrate this whole place if I have to. Now talk.”</p><p>He looked at me closely for a moment before continuing.</p><p>“I have never once hit Aria without her permission or with the intention to hurt her, nor have I ever made anyone do it for me. I did not kill her. She committed suicide.”</p><p>The words were the same but this time I could <em>feel</em> that he was speaking the truth.</p><p>“Why?” I asked, my hands clenched tightly.</p><p>“It goes back a long way. You will have to listen to the whole story to understand everything. But first answer a question for me. Who killed first Lucifer?”</p><p>“The Biblical God.” I answered as I felt a slight tinge in my head.</p><p>“No. The Biblical God killed the Beelzebub, Asmodeus and left the Leviathan on the verge of death but Lucifer was still alive if only exhausted….yet he would have survived. The one who killed him was….his own son Rizevim. Leviathan was also killed by Rizevim.”</p><p>….huh.</p><p>“Rizevim is a madman who desires nothing but chaos and wants to see the world burn. He knew that as the Biblical God had died along with three of the Satans, the factions would call for the end of the war. The Fallen Angels had already dropped out of the war and there was barely anything anyone could do. It would have been relatively peaceful….so he killed Lucifer because he knew that the descendants of the Original Satans would want to continue the war. Lucifer, prideful as he might have been, would have stopped the war. After all, it wasn’t him who had started the war. The Biblical God had been the one to do so. He was injured while sealing ‘The Beast of Apocalypse’ and was dying. He wanted to take down the Original Satans before that so that they wouldn’t gain an upper hand and take over Heaven before that. He made sure that all three sides were culled so much that no one would cause a war without risking extinction. A brutal but clever move if you ask me.”</p><p>The Archangels wouldn’t have done well if their father had passed away and the Satans and the Fallen had started the war then. It is understandable. Also knowing Rizevim, he is someone who would do such things without a doubt.</p><p>“Anyways, Rizevim was cursed by Lucifer to die at the hands of another Lucifer for his betrayal.”</p><p>….what? A prophecy, curse? Are you shitting me?</p><p>Then again Rizevim in canon also died at the hands of Vali even after being hit with an overloaded Booster Gear and Fafnir’s dream attacks.</p><p>In a way this actually happened.</p><p>He however unaware of this continued, “It is unknown how much of the curse is real and how much is fake but Rizevim since then has made it a point to torture every Lucifer and break them just to mock his Father’s last words. The Lucifer Magic Circle given to the main house members all have a kill switch bound to the soul. I was marked at the age of six.”</p><p>“No it does not. I checked. There is only a tracker and I can remove it easily. There are no soul marks.”</p><p>“There was a mark in your Magic circle as well but….who do you think gave you the crest?”</p><p>….It wasn’t Rizevim who gave me the mark. It was actually Razevan.</p><p>“So Vienna?”</p><p>“This is why I didn’t want Vienna to learn magic because it would have required her to be marked as well.”</p><p>“No wait. Kill Switches and such magic are always connected to the Master and I can’t see Rizevim giving the leash to you. If the Kill Switch hadn’t been applied, he would have known.”</p><p>“Who says it wasn’t applied?” He raised his hand and the Lucifer Crest appeared on it.</p><p>I pushed a little magic inside it and scanned the Crest. I had enough experience to know what it looked like by studying my own. This one however had marks that were bound to the soul itself….three of them.</p><p>I stared at the man.</p><p>No lies.</p><p>….</p><p>“Aria?”</p><p>“Aria is someone I met after my second wife was killed or rather as reported to me….met an unfortunate accident while I was away. The first one had died in a similar manner. Both of them were killed by the kill switch in the Lucifer Magic Circle. In frustration, I left for the human world. There I met Aria and had saved her from being sold by her own family. She stuck to me since then. I had no intention of being in a relationship with her but that changed…. when she got pregnant. Vienna is my first  and only child in all my six hundred years of life. I wanted to make sure that she stayed as far away from me as possible but Rizevim’s people who followed and kept an eye on me found out about it. Aria was marked before I could hide them somewhere.”</p><p>The energy levels around him rose as he kept speaking further. Taking a deep breath before the energy levels were calmed again, he continued.</p><p>“We were brought here and both of us were trapped here with a knife to our necks. We didn’t want to lose the child. She was adamant to keep sticking to me and give birth while I wanted to have a child as well. Rizevim’s sick twisted thinking helped for once when he allowed Aria to give birth to a Half-Devil Lucifer despite being opposed by the entire Old Satan Faction. It was also your birth that took their attention away from Aria and Vienna because they were too busy planning everything about you. Aria and I both were already prepared to die since we were bound. What we simply wanted was for our daughter to survive and spend as much time as we could with her. I had been planning her escape for years.”</p><p>My head was already starting to hurt from this ridiculous story so I interrupted him.</p><p>“If you knew all this, then why didn’t you talk to me before?”</p><p>“Why didn’t you do the same?” he returned back.</p><p>“I didn’t trust you. You say you didn’t hit Aria but there were bruises on her body. Was she inflicting self-harm?”</p><p>“No. It is a simple trick with Demonic Power. Demonic power, while good for Devils, is corrosive to humans. Simply concentrating demonic power at a spot for a moment can cause a bruise. It doesn’t hurt and is only cosmetic. Most Devils here don’t know of it because they never take interest in humans and the only time they use demonic power on them is to kill. It was to keep others from discovering us. Rizevim wanted to see me suffer and I showed him just that. As for why I didn’t talk to you, it is the same….I didn’t trust you.”</p><p>“You didn’t trust a child that was raised in your own house, in front of your own eyes?” I gritted out the words out of my mouth barely controlling my anger.</p><p>He seemed completely unphased by the question and replied just as calmly.</p><p>“I could trust a child….but you are not a child, are you?”</p><p>And for another moment, my heart stopped.</p><p>“It seems that you forgot that I am an Empath….well was. No two year old child that has been shut in an Observation Pod since birth can have that many and such precise emotions. The only possibility was….a reincarnation.”</p><p>A cold chill ran through my spine as he looked towards me with a casual expression.</p><p>“Reincarnation is not unheard of in this world. Souls of the famous Heroes are reborn now and then. There are various types of reincarnations as well. Some with only the special soul, some with their instincts and general memory, some come back and regain their entire memories over time by adulthood. I wasn’t sure whose reincarnation you are and what kind. I couldn’t trust you if you were, say….the reincarnation of a Christian Hero. Aria however trusted you. She was very adamant about protecting you, so I decided to observe. If there were indications that you intended to harm anyone of the two, I would have found a way for you to have an accident as well. I would have thrown you to Rizevim the first moment I could. Even if I hide my Trait from everyone, I have more than one way to expose you. It was not needed thankfully. I saw that you were genuinely protective of Aria and Vienna as well. Then you became close to Gretel and tried to help her. Although your general unawareness about many things makes me think that you only have a very basic knowledge of the world with some of your instincts. It is not a perfect reincarnation. That said, you can understand why I was wary of you.”</p><p>I watched the man while things kept falling in place one by one.</p><p>Why Aria had rejected every time? Why she refused to leave him?</p><p>There were never any fights between them. The pain in her eyes was not about her bruises….but that she was forced to hide everything.</p><p>She knew that she was going to die anyway. She didn’t know that I could remove the kill switch from her soul.</p><p>There was no chance for her according to her.</p><p>I know I had hidden about my powers from her and I didn’t have any right to question anything but still a traitorous part of my head was screaming just one thing repeatedly.</p><p>“She could have told me.” I whispered very slowly to myself.</p><p>Razevan however heard this and replied, “Do you really think Aria is the type of person who would burden a nine year old child that she considers her own with something like this? Put yourself in her place and tell me if you would do that. No matter how strong you are or how talented you are, would a mother really willingly put her prepubescent child in danger, especially in such a case. You were too busy thinking about yourself that you never considered her point of view. It was already killing her to pretend and hide things from you and yet she kept it all inside so that you don’t do anything reckless and get hurt. Also, would she really leave Vienna?”</p><p>My hands clenched tighter….because I knew that she wouldn’t….I wouldn’t.</p><p>“You say that you didn’t talk to me because you didn’t trust me but why didn’t you talk to her?”</p><p>“I was worried that you would read her mind. I couldn’t risk others finding out.”</p><p>He nodded his head, “A wise decision. Too bad you snapped at the wrong time.”</p><p>My head almost whipped in his direction.</p><p>“The day you had the argument and little outburst with Aria, did you check your surroundings continuously?”</p><p>I recalled it. I hadn’t. I was too upset to check. My mind was immediately flooded with several dangerous possibilities.</p><p>“Your outburst was felt by a servant outside the room and while he didn’t find out the topic discussed, this was reported to Rizevim. I was called and asked to bring Aria later so that he could have a ‘talk’ with her. We were very near the time for Vienna and you to escape and thus couldn’t afford to make any mistakes. She didn’t want to take any chances so Aria committed suicide. I pretended that it was me. The normal plan was to send Vienna, you and Gretel to a friend of mine. He would have kept you safe from the Devils and given you three asylum in his own faction if Aria somehow died. That however was delayed because you would have attacked me if I had tried to talk to you any sooner.”</p><p>My mind was blank right now. His words were being heard but I was not sure I was processing everything though.</p><p>“Who? Who was the servant?”</p><p>He stopped for a moment and then answered, “It was the one you burned that day.”</p><p>….</p><p>Not even his soul was left so I can’t resurrect him back to life anymore to interrogate or even torture.</p><p>I pulled out of my thoughts and asked the next question.</p><p>“What changed? Why now?”</p><p>“If I am not wrong then someone among the people here is going to try to assassinate Vienna during an attack here. They are planning to sic you on the current government by claiming that they were behind the attack. I couldn’t take this risk so I rushed my plans forward.”</p><p>My Conqueror’s threatened to burst out as my eyes became colder “Do you have a name?”</p><p>He unfortunately shook his head. “No. I only got the gist of the plan. It was decided among Euclid, Rizevim, Shalba and Creuserey. They didn’t invite Katerea for this because of your previously close relationship though.”</p><p>I didn’t say anything. My mind running at full power to process everything.</p><p>The Trait which I received from Razevan was telling me that it was true. My Observation Haki was telling me that it was true. Even my Essence was telling me that it was true.</p><p>This utter bastard whom I had zealously hated for all these years was actually the one trying to protect everyone while I was the one who fucked up and caused Aria’s death.</p><p>I rested my face in my palms while rubbing my forehead.</p><p>“What is your plan? Who is this friend of yours?” I asked in a low voice.</p><p>I will obviously stay in the bases that my people have prepared but it still doesn’t hurt to hear his plan.</p><p>“The Governor General of the Fallen Angels, Azazel.” He spoke just as softly.</p><p>I looked up incredulously from between my palms.</p><p>“Yes. I know it seems very strange but I have been in contact with Azazel for over four hundred years since I had saved his life once. It was a chance to pull one over Rizevim and stop a second Great War from starting. We have stayed in touch after it although barely. I again reached out to him a few years after Vienna was born. She was detected to have a Longinus Class Sacred Gear. Azazel is known to collect and study Sacred Gear users. Her having a Sacred Gear would give him an excuse to shelter her despite any protests under the guise of studying the Longinus. I would have pretended to attack you all and chase you to the boundaries of the Fallen Angel territories where he would have saved you and taken you in. It would have convinced Vienna and Gretel and you could have managed the rest.” He went on babbling while I was thinking about something else.</p><p>It all started to make sense now.</p><p>How could a seven year old Vali escape from this….this hellhole all by himself and be miraculously found by Azazel?</p><p>Sure it could have been luck but then again there were several incidents just like this all over the world for all of this to be a coincidence.</p><p>No way could a normal servant have taken Vali away.</p><p>Azazel being connected to Razevan made sense. Also after that there was no real mention of Razevan Lucifer….most probably because Razevan….had died.</p><p>I pushed it to the back of my mind to ask something else for now.</p><p>“Azazel would keep Vienna, sure. But what about Gretel and me? We don’t have Sacred Gears and I don’t think the Fallen Angels would welcome a Satan Class Lucifer-Asmodeus spawn with open arms.”</p><p>He shook his head. “Unlike what you would believe, some Fallen Angels have a close relationship with Devils. The Vice Governor General of the Fallen Angels, Shemhazai is in a relationship with a devil in secret. There are many such cases. If anything, quite a few of the Fallen Angels would want someone as strong as you and Gretel on their side. That said, I have already prepared for such an event. It is why this plan took this long. I had to find the last pieces for it to complete. Aria was adamant about not leaving the two of you behind and you would have caused too much trouble if I had tried to forcibly take Vienna away from you.”</p><p>He opened a hole in space and brought out two bright orbs from inside it.</p><p>“These two are for You and Gretel.”</p><p>I looked at the orbs with an open mouth. I knew what it was. I was collecting these for a while.</p><p>“Which ones are these?”</p><p>“Innovate Clear and a Vritra Type Sacred Gear- Delete Field. I have already sent two more Vritra Type Sacred Gears to Azazel as a payment to take the two of you in.”</p><p>Innovate Clear?</p><p>What the fuck?</p><p>“How? Where did you even find this?”</p><p>This was one of the things I had been searching non-stop for a while and no methods I had thought of or we had used could get to it. How did he even?</p><p>“It was a lucky hit. I borrowed the Sacred Gear Extractor from Azazel and extracted these. Unfortunately Sacred Gears, while very strong for the rest of the world, are almost useless against Rizevim. Although it’s not that I would get a chance to use it anyways. Don’t be foolish and try to fight him with a Sacred Gear. I have sent previous wielders of Longinuses towards him in hope to know of this fact.”</p><p>I know. I know that already.</p><p>Still Innovate Clear.</p><p>“I had been hunting for the Sephiroth Graal for a long time and even more so since Aria was marked but the previous wielder had actually died recently and that meant it would probably be reborn in a newborn. That was the only Sacred Gear I could think that could be used to free me. But it seems that I was out of luck. The previous wielders have often tried to kill the spawn of the Devil when I contacted them. They were all killed by me without any exception. Azazel had recently invented the extractor and I was looking forward to finding out the wielder of this generation but I am out of Luck. Aria is no more. Vienna will be safer without me around her and….and I am too tired.”</p><p>I couldn’t help but whisper out.</p><p>“I can remove the mark.”</p><p>H’s eyes widened a bit before a bitter smile came over his face which was followed by a self-depreciating, quiet laugh.</p><p>“I can still save you if you want.”</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>“No. The Fallen Angels would not accept me. It would indicate them siding with the Old Satan Faction. My face is too well known. They wouldn’t have taken Aria in either. If Azazel was taking a child, he had to show that they would not be influenced by any adult. Aria And I were out. They wouldn’t trust an adult with prior connections with the Old Satan Faction. Moreover Aria’s position as my wife would have led to severe political repercussions. The Fallens would have blamed her to be a spy while the Old Satan Faction would have blamed the Fallen to seduce the wife of a Lucifer. Trust me, I had already thought of all the possibilities.” I tried to open my mouth and was stopped. “I have assigned Azazel as the guardian of Vienna. As for you and Gretel, I had documents snuck in and signed which would indicate you being disowned from the House of Lucifer and Gretel as the Head of the Lucifuge. It was before her mother had died. They have no legal claim over you all. It is also a reason that I have to die. They will never let me off when this is discovered.”</p><p>“I have places where you can hide.” I countered. He has been helping us for all this time, bearing all this by himself. His experience and strength would help me a lot.</p><p>He however shook his head. “It wouldn’t. It would only give people more reasons to target you using me as an excuse. If you have a place to hide, then you should hide there. Train and become strong. With the tools and potential you three have, you can all become Super Devils for sure. At such a time, any faction would think twice before attacking you….well except the Hindu Pantheon. I have no more patience nor mental fortitude to take it any longer. Six Hundred Years of servitude is more than enough.”</p><p>“But what about Vienna? You can live with her. You can be a parent. I will even bring back Aria as soon as I can. There are ways to bring back the dead after all.”</p><p>His eyes fluctuated for a moment before he closed them. “No. It wouldn’t work.”</p><p>“Why?” I asked, getting a little angry now.</p><p>“Vienna should never find out the truth.” He looked up at me and said very seriously. “I should always remain a villain in front of her.”</p><p>“Why do all this? There is no need.”</p><p>“There is. Vienna has the Divine Dividing Sacred Gear. If she finds this out, there is a high chance that she will snap. Juggernaut Drive is not something I want my daughter to experience, much less an uncontrollable one. Dragon Type Sacred Gears are extremely dangerous to their hosts. I cannot and will not take the risk. If you want Aria to be revived, do it after all three of you are strong enough. Make your place in this world. If you want anything from me, I can support you, even my life but <strong><em>I will not place my daughter in any danger</em></strong>.”</p><p>We both stared at each other for a few moments and although I understood it, it was still hard not to hate this bastard, just slightly.</p><p>“So what will you do now?” I asked, keeping this conversation in the back of my head. I will resurrect this asshat whenever I want, along with Aria. As soon as I am strong enough.</p><p>He does plan anything for me.</p><p>“I will most likely be killed soon enough as soon as they discover everything. I will keep in hiding for a while and then kill as many as I can before I am killed. You all however need to run.”</p><p>“I will remove your Kill Switch.”</p><p>I couldn’t bind him because he was far stronger than me but using Broker was good enough.</p><p>I brought out two contracts. One was for not betraying me. The other was for transferring the Kill Switch to the ones who sign it.</p><p>I thought of something and brought out a third one. This was a modified Suicide Contract which would send all the abilities and power back to the contract if the one who signs it dies. I can then transfer that power to someone at a later date.</p><p>“Read these. You will know what you have to do.” I said and he was already on to the contracts.</p><p>After reading the first one, he looked towards me. “I can see why Katerea was so afraid of you now. There must be some conditions to this power as well. If I had to guess, then the one signing it must be aware of the terms of the contract and willingly sign it or I can see you slipping one of these in every office of the Old Satan Faction.”</p><p>I nodded my head. This fucker is a genius. He already figured out a vital part of the contract.</p><p>“It is still a fearful power. Anyways, change the first contract to, I will not betray you as long as you don’t betray or harm Vienna. I don’t want to trade myself from one master to another, especially one who can even control my mind.”</p><p>I added the changes along with a penalty and removed the mind control effect.</p><p>He nodded and read the other document.</p><p>The second one had him open his mouth in astonishment but it was the last one which totally blew his mind.</p><p>“You….this….just what kind of a monster have they made?” he all but whispered.</p><p>“The kind that shouldn’t be messed with.”</p><p>“If this works, this I want you to give all this power to Vienna.” He replied stoically.</p><p>“She is not strong enough to assimilate all this power that said, I promise that I will give all your powers along with the Lucifer Trait that I have gained from you to her as soon as she can handle it.”</p><p>“Make another contract.”</p><p>I shook my head at the man. This bastard trusts me with his daughter but not with the power?</p><p>“Don’t mind me. Power makes people blind. I want you to make a contract that you will not betray Vienna and give my powers to her when she is capable of handling it. I have left enough leeway in the contract as a show of trust towards you. I have lived too long in a place with no trust. This is already more than I could afford to.”</p><p>Is this the result of living in a place where one couldn’t trust anyone? Would I have turned out like this too?</p><p>I modified the contracts while he added his comments and signed when the two of us were completely satisfied with it.</p><p>I passed back his trait to him. I had already seen it work and personally experienced it as well.</p><p>The Archmage has already made an outline of this magic.</p><p>He passed me the time and meeting place with Azazel.</p><p>“Wait till the fifteenth of this month. You will hear about the news of an attack on this place. If you want to attack someone, do it after that.”</p><p>His eyes widened and he spoke or rather scolded me, “You….”</p><p>“I have already sent Vienna away with Gretel, the moment you revealed your power. They will stay there. I will arrange a way to cover for them but I want to leave a nice surprise for Rizevim, one that will keep him indisposed for a long time if possible. Don’t worry about it. I will talk to Azazel myself. But before going there I am going to personally tear apart the one who wanted to kill Vienna.”</p><p>“Don’t let your personal emotions cloud your judgement. There is still risk. You can get killed in the attack.”</p><p>“No chance. After all….why would my own people kill me?” I smiled this time.</p><p>This bastard was pulling one nuke after another on me. It is just so satisfying to make the last hit myself.</p><p>His eyes widened comically, almost threatening to pop out and then….then he burst out into a laugh.</p><p>A laugh that contained joy, humor, pain, satisfaction and even a bit of hope but the most prominent emotion no doubt was his vengeance.</p><p>I saw tears in the corner of his eyes.</p><p>“….ha hahaha….yes. This is the best. Turns out that Lucifer was right after all. This is the best result I could have asked for.”</p><p>He laughed a little more and then left the place in a flash of magic circle.</p><p>I sat back down on my own seat. In front of me was a letter.</p><p>A letter from Aria.</p><p>I took a deep breath and opened it.</p><p>That night there would be a dreaded quiet on the outside while a storm of emotions raged inside my mind.</p><p> ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p><p><strong>Beta Reader: LuluViBritania(FF.N, SB and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th BritannianEmperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note :</strong></p><p><strong>I kinda took a break from writing. It was becoming too much for me to update fast.</strong></p><p><strong>A little rest and a few good stories have recharged me.</strong></p><p><strong>Now this chapter had a lot going on.</strong></p><p><strong>I know I am going to get severe flames about some of these things but I had this planned for a while and I am not going to change it just because some people would be unhappy. (B/N ‘;..;’)</strong></p><p><strong>Anyways, I was asked about which weapon I would choose for Damien.</strong></p><p><strong>Telos Karma was the best I could think of. Controlling Probability(B/N: at the level that gives a base human the potential to kill Deities.

Y . )]. I don’t want to do that.</strong></p><p><strong>I will be making(or trying to make any) sense of whatever incidents happen in this story.</strong></p><p><strong>Turns out Razevan was a Snape(who didn’t get cucked).</strong></p><p><strong>It would explain how Vali magically encountered Azazel and Azazel even took him in much better than <em><u>just because</u></em>.</strong></p><p><strong>Also the Innovate Clear and a Vritra type Sacred Gear, which Gretel would obviously not be using, because Dimension Lost is better was a nice surprise.</strong></p><p><strong>I wrote this to show that not everyone is a fool.(B/N: As Overpowered as Damien will be he ain’t no Gary Stu)</strong></p><p><strong>Rizevim was probably smirking at the whole Damien pretending to be a big boy thing because he thought he had the Kill Switch and never thought of Damien as a danger to himself.</strong></p><p><strong>He did say that Aria’s death was an accident. As in it was highly likely Razevan accidentally killed her than purposely. He even mocked that he was now torturing children and women, and that he grew up.</strong></p><p><strong>I mean why would Razevan whose single stray slap could have killed Aria kept her alive for so long.</strong></p><p><strong>And we don’t hear anything about Razevan Lucifer in the whole story after that.</strong></p><p><strong>This explanation made more sense to me.</strong></p><p><strong>Just deal with it.</strong></p><p><strong>Anyways enjoy the chapter.</strong></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br><br><br><br><br><br></p><p> </p><p><br><br><br></p><p> </p><p><br></p>",

    "content": "<p><strong>Disclaimer : I own nothing.</strong></p><p><strong>Chapter 7 : Innocence Lost.</strong></p><p><strong>- Damien –</strong></p><p>I hurried back to the Old Satan Faction headquarters as soon as I heard Vienna’s message and my mind ran into an overdrive.</p><p>Why so suddenly?</p><p>The possibilities made me clench my fists in frustration and rage though.</p><p>The only things I could think of was Aria speaking of these things to Razevan and him killing her in rage or him maybe…. looking through her mind, seeing our conversation and attacking her.</p><p>….</p><p>I should have removed her memory of our talk.</p><p>Guilt threatened to overwhelm me while the infinite Willpower was raging to come out and tear everything in its path apart.</p><p>I ruthlessly crushed it all under my Occlumency Shields.</p><p>We appeared directly outside the residence and I ran inside as fast as possible.</p><p>The house was clean.</p><p>No one was present.</p><p>I spread my Observation Haki outside and sensed someone approaching.</p><p>Thousands of thoughts racing through my head.</p><p>Was she alive and only unconscious?</p><p>Did Razevan leave after simply attacking her and Vienna found her unconscious?</p><p>Yes….she can still be alive. Keep control. I don’t know everything yet.</p><p>Katerea appeared inside soon after, “They are in the public cemetery.”</p><p>All that hope died.</p><p><strong>- Scene Change –</strong></p><p>We teleported to the cemetery right then.</p><p>I pushed all my emotions down and walked in.</p><p>Public Cemetery. In simple words a place where the servants are disposed off. A place where not even pillar devils would bury their deceased.</p><p>There were few people, mostly servants. I saw Razevan standing beside the coffin with an emotionless face. Shalba and Creuserey were there but it would be to merely watch a show. Rizevim and Euclid were not present.</p><p>I could care less about it though.</p><p>I walked and there Vienna was sitting beside the coffin with her body shaking. Her sobs were heart wrenching and for a moment I felt….fear.</p><p>I didn’t want to see inside the coffin. A silly cowardly part of me was telling me that if I would wake up this would just be a dream. I pushed those thoughts aside and walked forward.</p><p>Gretel was holding Vienna but she was holding herself back as well.</p><p>Aria had been a mother figure for the poor girl as well but her position didn’t allow her to do anything. She couldn’t even cry to keep on the mask.</p><p>“Damien! When did you return?” I heard Shalba’s voice but I walked forward robotically.</p><p>The voice however got Vienna’s attention as she turned back. Gretel looked at me at that very instant as well.</p><p>Her eyes were red from crying for a long time. She ran towards me and hugged me tightly and sobbed even more than before while I could only hold her and walk towards the coffin slowly.</p><p>In that coffin lay Aria’s body. She looked so peaceful. As if she would wake up any moment and….and….</p><p>“D-dummy mama is <em>sob</em>….mama is <em>sob</em>” Vi’s grip became tighter on me.</p><p>I stretched my hand and touched Aria’s face. Her skin was cold. The same skin that was hugging me not a few hours ago was now cold.</p><p>The scene when I had left her hug rudely came back to me and the guilt threatened to crush me with every instant that passed.</p><p>I took a strand of hair from Aria’s head and slowly slipped it inside my sleeve.</p><p>I will see her alive.</p><p>After all this is taken care of.</p><p>I hugged Vienna as the servants proceeded with everything. Her grave was covered while Vienna wailed and I kept a tight grip on her all the time.</p><p>After everything was done, she was desperately hugging me.</p><p>By now, her wails had been reduced into choking sobs.</p><p>“Vienna, what do you think you are doing? Get away from the Young Lord and return back to your room.” Razevan’s voice sounded behind me.</p><p>My hand clenched.</p><p>This Bastard. THIS BASTARD was responsible for everything.</p><p>The miserable life of Vienna, the death of Aria, <a href=\"https://everything….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">everything….it</a> is his damn fault.</p><p>It is all <em>his</em> fault.</p><p>However I couldn’t feel anger at all.</p><p>There were no eruptions of rage or demonic powers. Even my Conqueror’s Haki was extremely calm.</p><p>….</p><p>Unlike what people say, anger is not always explosive in nature.</p><p>No.</p><p>When any negative emotion crosses a certain limit, the mind goes blank.</p><p>There is only a field of white inside one’s mind. It may be the mind’s self-defense against extreme emotions.</p><p>I just couldn’t feel any rage at all. No sorrow. No nothing.</p><p>Not even fear or caution.</p><p>“VIENNA GET BACK HERE NOW.”</p><p>I then looked towards Vienna and took her hand in mind, “Say goodbye to mama. You don’t want to send her away with tears.” She looked unwilling but still waved towards the grave.</p><p>I took her hand and led her out of the cemetery.</p><p>“Young Lord, Vienna needs to be alone for a while. She has to learn how to behave.” Razevan said glaring towards Vienna who trembled at the voice.</p><p>I turned back.</p><p><strong>- Katerea Leviathan –</strong></p><p>Katerea was dreading the thoughts of what would happen today since she found out what had happened here through Damien.</p><p>She had felt Damien going stiff after their meeting was over and when asked that the human wife of Razevan had an accident.</p><p>She already had an idea about what could have happened and she was probably the only one here who had <em>any</em> idea just how close Damien was with the Human woman.</p><p>It was something he had hidden extremely well.</p><p>While she was actually quite miffed about the fact that someone like Damien would put that much value towards a lowly human, it didn’t change the fact that it was true.</p><p>It was the same for the half-breed daughter of hers too.</p><p>So when Razevan shouted just now, her heart almost stopped beating for an instant.</p><p>Damien turned back.</p><p>The look in his eyes is something that would haunt Katerea forever. There were no heavy Demonic Power suppressions or whatever it is that he normally does, no anger, no rage, not even a hint of emotion in those eyes. Even back then when he had enslaved her, he held a hint of superiority in his eyes. It was as if his very presence mocked her. It enraged her every time she thought of it but now….now she would rather have that look in Damien’s eyes than whatever….whatever <em>this</em> is.</p><p>She had to stop him before he did something terrible. She took a step forward but before she could say something, he spoke.</p><p>“Are you questioning me?”</p><p>Katerea’s words got stuck inside her throat. She felt a cold chill run through her spine.</p><p>Those four words were said with extreme causality. So much so that it was eerily terrifying.</p><p>Razevan too seemed to have a sense of self-preservation so he kept quiet as did Shalba and Creuserey too.</p><p>He turned back and took the girl with him while the Lucifuge girl followed.</p><p>Katerea let out a breath that she had been holding.</p><p>Suddenly a voice interrupted. A servant stepped forward and spoke loudly, “Young Lord Please don’t be rude….”</p><p><strong>BOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMM</strong></p><p>It happened instantly and Katerea put a barrier in front of everyone.</p><p>A tall pillar of blue flames erupted all around the servant and rose through the cemetery into the skies.</p><p>The demonic blue flames of Asmodeus. The Strongest Demonic Flames of the Underworld. It was the form of passion flames taken to the extreme capable of burning off even souls.</p><p>She had no idea that the Young Lord had reached <em>this</em> level with his Clan Trait.</p><p>A full minute later the flame pillar subsided. And not even ashes were left.</p><p>She turned around to see the haunted look in Razevan’s eyes. It was not surprising after all. Razevan was only a High Ultimate Class devil and this attack could have absolutely destroyed any Ultimate Class Devil. Even the Phenex’s famed Immortality would be absolutely useless. A soul cannot revive after all.</p><p>Shalba was looking dazed while Creuserey was clenching his hands while his eyes were wide in shock.</p><p>While all this was going on, she had only one thought in her mind – Had Damien Lucifer finally snapped and stopped holding back?</p><p><strong>- Euclid Lucifuge –</strong></p><p>He looked from a distance at the pillar of flame that rose to the sky as a shiver ran through his back.</p><p>“Uyahahaha Asmodeus’s flames. Now isn’t that surprising? This is indeed a very interesting development, what do you say Euclid?” He heard Rizevim’s voice behind him and turned back.</p><p>“It is indeed unexpected to see the Young Lord have this much proficiency with the Asmodeus Clan Trait.” Euclid said while wiping off the sweat on his forehead. This was way more than anything he could have imagined. “Still it is a surprise that Lord Razevan’s wife died like this. After all the first two….”</p><p>“Were unfortunate accidents.” The statement was interrupted by Lord Rizevim and he wisely kept quiet.</p><p>“Yes….unfortunate accidents indeed. It is just surprising that this one happened while Lord Razevan was present himself.”</p><p>“Ehh….he might have grown a spine and become a real devil for a change, who knows. Bullying women and children….Uyahahahha maybe there is hope for that useless brat after all.”</p><p>Euclid was about to say more before he realized that Damien Lucifer was walking in this direction.</p><p>“Hahahaha Damien….that was a glorious display of Asmodeus’ Flames. He was one of the Devils that I respected. A true embodiment of evil. Took whatever he wanted, destroyed whatever he disliked. Truly a marvelous Devil. So….what made you use those flames?” Lord Rizevim questioned the boy while the half-breed was already asleep and floating beside him. A sleeping spell maybe?</p><p>As much as Euclid disliked that brat, his manners never left anything to be desired. He bowed slightly towards Lord Rizevim and then gave an answer that made his blood chill.</p><p>“His voice was annoying.”</p><p>There was no change in his tone, no extra emotion. It was as if that was the most simple answer and the one asking the question should have known it for a fact already. It was as if a common response for finding someone’s voice annoying was to nuke them with the most dangerous flames in hell.</p><p>It was an answer so surprising that even Lord Rizevim was stunned for a moment before he broke out in a loud laugh that echoed through the halls of the place.</p><p>“Uyahahahahhaha wonderful, wonderful indeed. Spoken like a true devil. Devils are the embodiment of all that is evil. Destroy anything you dislike. I like that attitude. Hup hup then, don’t let me hold you back from doing any evil you want.”</p><p>He bowed and left.</p><p>No words were spoken.</p><p>“This is what a devil should be like Euclid. Yes. He will be interesting indeed. Much more interesting than that disappointing son of mine. I wonder how long he will last though.”</p><p>“Lord Rizevim….about….”</p><p>“About your sister? Well if things can be rewarded, then it can always be taken away for any mistakes. Don’t worry about it.”</p><p><strong>- Gretel Lucifuge –</strong></p><p>Gretel followed the Young Lord at a distance to avoid being stopped by others.</p><p>Her Master has been the light of her life these years. Since she met him first at the age of eight. A white haired blue eyed boy asked her to play with him and then ordered her when she couldn’t gather enough courage to do so.</p><p>Gretel had been ordered basically each day to do things before, things that were painful, things that she disliked but that was probably the first time that an order made her feel happy as she followed it.</p><p>That was her first meeting with the person whom she would swear her life to. Over the years her time spent in the hall of her Master’s house became the brightest time of the day for her. He ordered her to do things that would make her happy, things that normal girls her age should do. For normal people it would seem that he was an egotistical control freak who liked everyone following his orders and to be honest for the first few months even she thought the same. It took her about a year to understand that those orders were actually to protect her. No one could complain if it was Damien Lucifer giving the orders though. Thus no one could stop or punish her for doing things she wanted to.</p><p>It made her truly happy then and her trust in Damien Lucifer rose as a person and not just the Young Lord.</p><p>Things back where she stayed were never good. She could barely count the number of times she had seen her mother since she turned four. If she used her fingers, she would have enough to spare even if only one hand was used. She hated everything about that place. She hated the person….taking care of her.</p><p>Euclid Lucifuge was the one she hated the most in this world.</p><p>He tried to make her into a clone of Grayfia. She didn’t even know or have any desire to know that woman. As far as she was concerned, she was the reason for her mother to be in that state, the death of her three elder brothers and now this state of hers.</p><p>She was never good at the Lucifuge Ice magic because she didn’t inherit that power and yet she was forced, tortured to excel at it….just because Grayfia was so. When she didn’t succeed, she was caned, and verbally abused for being useless.</p><p>She hated it. She absolutely detested it. To become like the one responsible for her pains, for her mother’s pains.</p><p>Her Mother had once told her not to hate Grayfia and that she covered for her of her own violation. Grayfia didn’t do anything….but she was wrong. If Grayfia hadn’t betrayed the family, none of this would have happened.</p><p>And now she was being molded into a copy of the person she detested.</p><p>She hated it with everything. Later she found out that it was also this aversion of her to Grayfia that slowed down her training in Ice Magic.</p><p>Devil Magic is based on imagination. If one doesn’t want something from the core of their heart, their magic would always hold itself back.</p><p>Her hesitation became the source of her weakness which in turn took a toll on her confidence. She was literally on the verge of a breakdown when her Master had first found her.</p><p>The small meals with Master Damien, Miss Vienna and Lady Aria were the happiest times of her life.</p><p>It was a place where she had no pressure on her to excel in everything she did. No one asked her to be perfect, no one asked her to be….someone she was not. She had always considered that place as her home more than anything. It was the place where she had sworn herself to her Master.</p><p>He had given her all of this power. He had seen through all her insecurities, fears and hesitations and in return for all of this, all he asked was for her loyalty and….to be herself.</p><p>Damien Lucifer wanted Gretel Lucifuge as his aide….not a copy of Grayfia Lucifuge, not anyone else….just her. She remembered those words clearly even now and she doubted that she would forget it till the day she died.</p><p>She was finally wanted by a person for who she was. Although Gretel had never said it before, she was always afraid of being unwanted. She knew how she was born and she always held a fear that even mother didn’t want her. Her mother had never been anything but kind and caring to her and had given her all the love she could but in the passing years this thought had always eaten away at her mind.</p><p>This was the first time that someone had wanted her….just her, Gretel Lucifuge and that broke down all the dams that had been holding back her emotions all these years. Her training to keep her emotions in check was all bypassed and she cried. She cried like a child.</p><p>On that day she swore herself to her Master and….to herself. She would become someone worthy to stand beside Damien Lucifer, The Devil.</p><p>It was the reason why she begged him not to interfere when things became worse when she started excelling in her studies.</p><p>Euclid made her feel disgusted whenever he even looked at her. She felt dirty. She knew what his thoughts were. Lady Aria had taken and fulfilled the duties of a mother as well for her. But she didn’t involve her Master in this. She didn’t want to burden him any more than he already was, thinking of a way to escape from this place and survive, protect his loved ones and train. He was two years younger than her and yet he worked much much harder than her so how could she ask for his assistance in this matter. If she couldn’t even take care of this, then how would she be worthy of standing beside him.</p><p>He had chosen her as his aide. She knew about Lady Katerea, even about teacher Ophelia and other girls who were bound by her Master. Each of them were experts in their own fields. They were beautiful and able and he could have chosen anyone to be at his side and yet….and yet he chose her. So she would do her best to respond to his actions.</p><p>This is why she trained. She mastered everything that was taught by the teachers and then everything that her Master taught her. She even explored her Trait of the Power over Space from her father’s side all that so she doesn’t become a burden to her Master and could become useful to him one day in the future.</p><p>She had known her Master better than anyone here so she could understand just how angry he was at this moment. She was desperately shouting through their link for him to not attack when Razevan had tried to take away Miss Vienna.</p><p>Master had held himself back desperately for all these years and all this pain was simply for them to have a chance to escape this place. She didn’t want him to throw all that away in a moment of rage.</p><p>Now she was heading to him in fear that he would be angry at her for her interruptions.</p><p>Gretel opened the door to his room. She noticed the barriers around the place and was relieved that she was allowed inside.</p><p>Her Master was on his bed with Miss Vienna sleeping beside him with her head in his lap.</p><p>She closed the door behind her and bowed, “I am sorry for interrupting you Master.”</p><p>“No….I am actually thankful that you did what you did. I was not in the right state of mind back then. I am not sure if I am in control even now. I really would have attacked and killed Razevan if you hadn’t interrupted me.”</p><p>She calmed down a lot on hearing this. At least he wasn’t angry with her.</p><p> “It would have created unnecessary complications. We need to prepare Gretel. We will be leaving this place soon. I just need Vi to get upto pace before leaving.” He kept speaking but Gretel noticed something wrong with his voice.</p><p>Her Master always kept a stoic face and a simple cold tone but she always felt his emotions through his voice….but right now she couldn’t feel anything.</p><p>She hated it.</p><p>This type of voice from her Master made her feel suffocated. This is not how her Master should be. His eyes looked vacant as he stared towards the wall and spoke.</p><p>It was as if there was no life in them at all and Gretel HATED! it with all her heart.</p><p>She didn’t realize it as she was inching forwards towards him and was almost near the bed.</p><p>“….arrangements will be made….Gretel?”</p><p>And then she hugged him.</p><p>She didn’t know what brought this upon her or how she even thought of it but somewhere in her heart she knew that if she didn’t do this right now, she would lose something very precious to her. Something that she would regret for the rest of her life.</p><p>She felt him become still for a moment but she kept holding and slowly caressed his hair.</p><p>“It is fine to cry sometimes, Master.” She whispered slowly to him, her own voice cracking.</p><p>His breath hitched and she felt his heartbeat increase a little.</p><p>“Please….just let it out.”</p><p>She kept holding her Master and slowly he hugged her. She didn’t feel any sobs or cries but she felt wetness on the place his eyes were at and she tightened her grip to take the boy further in her embrace.</p><p>They stayed like this for who knows how long while Gretel vowed to herself to become stronger.</p><p><strong>- Damien –</strong></p><p>I woke up the next day between Vienna and Gretel and suddenly the memories of the previous day came rushing forward.</p><p>The pain was enhanced by the guilt that I was probably the cause of Aria’s death.</p><p>In a way I am extremely grateful to Gretel for last night. If not, I don’t know what I might have done.</p><p>Occlumency suppresses the emotions but doesn’t remove them. There is only so much one can suppress until it breaks all the restraints.</p><p>My actions last night were extremely unlike the normal me.</p><p>It would probably cause some serious surveillance on me from now on though.</p><p>I looked towards Vi.</p><p>With Aria now gone, she will probably be the target of all the pettiness that Razevan throws towards her and I am not sure if she can take it.</p><p>No.</p><p>I won’t take any risks anymore.</p><p>I have to leave this place as soon as possible and do it in a single chance.</p><p>One year.</p><p>Even with everything, I will still need one year for this to work.</p><p><em>“Alicia.”</em> I called inside my mind.</p><p><em>“Young Lord, are you….?”</em></p><p><em>“I am fine. I want you to follow a new set of instructions.”</em> I instructed before she could ask anything else.</p><p><em>“Yes, My Lord.”</em></p><p><em>“I will be leaving this place in a year. I want a base of operations in a dozen countries. Make sure that the development of each base is completely independent from each other. You can make it look like a new business development or anything else, I will leave it to you. I would like it better if the entire place is hidden from everyone else. Use all the contracts I have passed onto you all if needed. I will be sending more contracts for this purpose and you can pass on any suggestions about the contracts if you want. I don’t want any complications in the development of these bases. Try not to contact Ophelia directly throughout this period. Maintain your usual business with her. I assume that she will be under watch too. The contracts will be left in a secure location and you will be informed about the location of the place by me. You can also discuss the plans with Cleria. She will be able to move much more freely than you.”</em></p><p>There was a slight pause on the other end. <em>“A year Master? Very well, it shall be done. We had already prepared a few bases before this in case you needed to leave suddenly. A dozen is just an unexpected number but nothing impossible. Do you have any preference on which place to occupy? Although I will relay that India will be next to impossible. The Hindu Pantheon’s rule is extremely strong in the place. ”</em></p><p><em>“I have no wish to have a base in India or tussle with the Hindu Pantheon. Italy, Japan, Britain, and America preferably. I would also like a place near Romania. Others I leave it to your choice. Consult with Helena and Charlene regarding all the Warding and Security details. I will be adding more from my side when I leave this place myself.”</em></p><p><em>“Yes My Lord, it will be done.”</em></p><p>I laid back and thought about the next steps to be taken. Looking at the two girls beside me, I wondered just how involved I had gotten with the two of them.</p><p>This coming year is going to be an absolute hell.</p><p><strong>- Cleria Belial –</strong></p><p>Cleria watched the photograph of her deceased lover. Unlike her, he was not marked and thus could not be brought back. His body was already taken away and disposed of. The Church refused to have anything to do with a traitor and Heaven's side was silent as always. Hypocrites all of them.</p><p>She knew the real reason why she was prosecuted. It was also one of the reasons why she followed the Young Lord so vehemently because he promised to get justice for Masaomi.</p><p>She looked forward towards her student and someone she has come to adore as a little sister now as she practiced her magic.</p><p>“Maintain the barrier and do not let the water freeze. Try to reduce the thickness of the shield for every barrier slowly but do not reduce the amount of energy in any of them. Concentrate.”</p><p>Diehauser, although stoic in front of everyone, is a very emotional person. Her cousin who treats her like nothing but a real sister has also taken a liking to her new Bishop.</p><p>Maybe it was her airheaded and pure personality or maybe it was the Absolute Demise Sacred Gear in her possession. Both made her a very interesting student to teach.</p><p>She knew that Diehauser was also teaching the Young Lord and was actually quite fond of him as well, not that he would say it out loud anytime.</p><p>Suddenly she received a communication and on checking found out that it was Victoria.</p><p>“Hello Victoria? It is extremely rare for you to call me. How can I help you today?”</p><p><em>“Something bad has happened Cleria!”</em> Victoria’s voice was hurried and tense.</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p><em>“Our Lord’s….Aria Lucifer is dead. She was killed by Razevan Lucifer yesterday. Lady Ophelia found out that Young Lord was extremely angry.”</em> Cleria felt her heart sink. Damien Lucifer’s closest subordinates, the ones he had bound all knew that he was extremely close to three people. Aria Lucifer was one of them. If she really died, then he was bound to do something erratic.</p><p>“How is he doing? Is there any information about him?” she questioned hurriedly. Her voice was heard by Diehauser who looked worriedly towards her but she just shook her head.</p><p><em>“Alicia received a communication ordering her to establish bases around the world. He has left some instructions regarding those. Lady Charlene and I were instructed on different things though.”</em></p><p>“What instructions?” she asked a little absentmindedly.</p><p><em>“We will soon be getting new contracts. These ones will be used to increase our powers at a faster pace. However we will have to hunt stray devils and some less than savory devils for this. The instructions will all be delivered to us about their hiding places and bases, defenses and skills. Lady Charlene will help in this matter as well. We both will point in the direction and you will have to take care of the matter.”</em> Cleria tensed a little at this but pushed the thought aside. The Young Lord’s gift had increased her power to identify magic and disable it much better than before. She has been training with her cousin and has gotten much stronger than just a few months ago. She was now steadily in the low Ultimate Class Devil level, moreover just the fact that she can be revived by her Master whenever she dies is already a big support for her. <em>“You will also be offered ways to carry out the operations such that no one can doubt you are behind these attacks. The Young Lord wants the Old Satan Faction to be a bit roughed up so their attention is scattered. Moreover, the more we can curb their power now, the lower their ability to send people to search for the Young Lord when he escapes. If anything he wants all of them to be turned over. You are allowed to use torture of any kind for it but if they are being difficult, just kill.”</em></p><p>“Will we be targeting only the Old Satan Faction members?” she asked while pondering over her thoughts.</p><p><em>“The mindless Stray Devils need to be killed and the members of the Old Satan Faction if not turned, will face the same end. We will also be hunting down powerful Stray Devils. As long as they have powerful abilities and Demonic Power, we will hunt them.”</em> Victoria explained. <em>“Our Master has asked that our identities, especially yours, should not be revealed. You will start the hunt after you receive the first set of contracts soon.”</em> explained Victoria quickly. <em>“It is said to be a gift for you and your peerage members. Master has also said that he will be binding Lavinia too as soon as he gets a chance. He needs to prepare for it though.”</em></p><p>“Any ideas what this gift might be?” she asked, a little intrigued. Her Master’s last gift had been the powers he gave her. Her magical prowess soared since she obtained these abilities so she was quite excited about the prospect of this new gift. As for Lavinia, she had already known that Master would mark her. He went through so much effort to find her after all. The increase in powers would also help Lavinia grow stronger. To be honest, she wanted to see Lavinia together with Damien. As far as she knew, Damien only had two girls with him and one of them was eight and someone he treated as a sister. The Lucifuge girl is also said to be stoic and serious, not that she blamed the poor girl. She just thought maybe Lavinia’s pure and simple nature will be a welcome change for him and also help his mental state a lot.</p><p>As someone who liked staying in the human world, Cleria knew about the mental health of people be it normal humans or supernatural beings.</p><p>The place where Damien and those two girls stayed was one of the worst places to nurture a healthy mind even by Devil standards.</p><p>Maybe Lavinia will be a breath of fresh air in Damien Lucifer’s life.</p><p>On the other hand Damien’s temperament might have a positive effect on Lavinia too. It could make her serious and mature a bit.</p><p>In all this time, Lavinia had grown on her and she had come to consider her bishop as a little sister. This little sister however needed someone to support her as well.</p><p><em>“I have no idea. These are just Lady Ophelia’s guesses of it being a gift. That said, I do not believe that Master would send any of us into danger without making us prepared for it.”</em></p><p>“True.”</p><p><strong>- Damien –</strong></p><p>I put down the last contract in my dimensional storage. This is the four hundredth one.</p><p>One hundred of four types of contracts.</p><p>It has been one week since Aria passed away.</p><p>The house had become hauntingly quiet.</p><p>Vienna would simply look at Aria’s room and cry while Gretel would try to support her during such times of distress and console the poor girl.</p><p>She also supported me by just staying by my side, simply holding my hand and sitting quietly at times. It was more than anything I could ask anyone for.</p><p>Especially her whom I knew was suffering much more than me.</p><p>The girl I was becoming the pillar or support has become the same for both Vienna and me.</p><p>I felt extremely useless for a few days but then decided to push those feelings aside and work even harder to leave this place as soon as possible.</p><p>If I want to escape the Old Satan Faction the planning has to be extremely elaborate, meaning that it should not only include how to escape but how to prevent myself and the ones I take with me from being dragged back and I can’t even imagine what would happen in such a case.</p><p>The first step was to gather a core group which has influence and money.</p><p>Yes, influence and money – Power can always be acquired later. Strong people have their movements monitored.</p><p>The team I have right now – all the people under my Binder Essence’s effect are the core group and the only one even close to that is Katerea who is bound by a deal.</p><p>Together they have enough resources and money to make a network for me. Information and knowledge is the most important commodity in any powerful organization.</p><p>Even thinking of fighting the entire world alone is the height of stupidity.</p><p>This is the same world which sealed even Trihexa and has beings like the Trimurti, Ophis and the Apocalypse Dragon Great Red. I can’t even fight Rizevim right now let alone those monsters.</p><p>They can always pull an Uzumaki on me and seal me.</p><p>Honestly the Biblical God must have been an Uzumaki descended from Naruto. Blonde and with a fetish for sealing.</p><p>Currently with the network established, the second part is to establish a base of operations.</p><p>Supernatural construction services are <em>extremely</em> fast and efficient.</p><p>That said, we took extreme care not to reveal our location. Each person involved in the construction had to sign a contract of loyalty until the work was complete after which they would lose any and all memories of the place constructed. There were other details involved which ironed the finer points until I was satisfied.</p><p>This will make it easier to make the location of the bases a secret.</p><p>To make sure that they sign the contract about the memory clause, this whole thing was divided into two parts with the memory clause being a part of a second contract which was signed after the loyalty contract.</p><p>Devils are very particular about loyalty, so they don’t want to sign a permanent contract but still a contract that ends when the work is complete is doable.</p><p>The simple glitch in this is….<strong>I decide when the work is complete</strong>.</p><p>The loyalty of so many experienced people at one go is always appreciated.</p><p>Several bases to hide all over the world is one of the basic requirements.</p><p>The third part is power.</p><p>Even if I can simply hide, it won’t be enough because I want to reveal myself eventually. This will need for me to make a strong enough force to back me up.</p><p>Supernatural Factions don’t want wars in general. The Old Satan Faction is an exception because these people are basically whiny sons of bitches who think the world owes them everything. But then again there are such people everywhere, raring to cause war for their own means without any care for others though.</p><p>The people I have bound directly, my core team can increase their powers easily with a nerfed version of my Essences. That said, only one person per year is not enough. Also the current rate of the increase in their powers is not enough.</p><p>Even a small faction like the Youkais in Japan have an Ultimate Class like Yasaka. And that is not to say that she is weak with their being so many Ultimate Class Devils in the Underworld. Nope.</p><p>With the help of the Leylines, Yasaka can exert as much power as a Heavenly Dragon, which is stronger than even Sirzechs, a Super Devil so no one would try to directly attack Kyoto until they can fight off such a power.</p><p>I remember that Kunou had to be used to catch Yasaka off-guard to capture her when the Hero Faction was opening the Dragon’s Gate.</p><p>That was however extremely absurd and if it even succeeded it would have been due to the three top level Longinuses along with several other Balance Breaker Sacred Gear users, Khaos Brigade’s support, Ophis’ power, etc. Yasaka in her Nine Tailed Fox’s True Form is absolutely no joke.</p><p>That said the main part of the faction’s power is the over a few hundred thousand population of Youkai in the faction. A dozen people can’t declare themselves as a sovereign country just because they have a nuke. A few million people together is a whole other story.</p><p>Every Faction has their hidden card which can temporarily offer them a power up to fight others off. A small group of strong people can only be like the Vali Team, strong but forced to flee every time.</p><p>That however is not acceptable to me. I refuse to simply just hide away my whole life.</p><p>So, we will be recruiting many people, through hook or by crook and establish a base such that it would make lives extremely miserable for others if we are touched. Find information and blackmail materials and put spies in every place.</p><p>This however is a long term plan. The short term goal is to attack the Old Satan Faction while also collecting power to increase the strength of my core members.</p><p>The next set of contracts are the ones which make contracted people give away their powers and unique abilities to the ones who sign the contract.</p><p>Increasing the Demonic Power by this method has already been observed by Katerea using the two contracts of the Amon and Shax devils I had killed earlier last year.</p><p>There were however some problems.</p><p>One of the devils who had obtained those powers didn’t have any negative consequences because he was at the same level of strength as the one’s whose power he absorbed. The other one however was not that lucky as he started vomiting blood, his internal organs were damaged and he died.</p><p>We obtained a rough idea that any devil could only increase their power by the amount of Demonic Power they already had at the very maximum.</p><p>It can take anything from one week to a month for a devil to get used to this new power. The control can be extremely shaky.</p><p>Imagine suddenly gaining double weight and trying to fight with it. I tried to write a contract for the memory transfer….well it didn’t end well.</p><p>Almost no devils train in mind arts. Just the usual brute force erasing of memories and hypnosis and almost nothing else.</p><p>The transfer of memories even if it was just their combat experience was not good especially with the extremely long lifespans of devils.</p><p>Two dozen brain-dead experiments later I decided to let that project rest.</p><p>The current mission given to Charlene, Victoria and Cleria will be to hunt down Stray Devils and make the targets sign the contract to give up their powers. This power will then be used to increase their own powers.</p><p>The Old Satans will be attacked and those who cannot be converted will be disposed of to reduce the power which can be employed to search for us after we run.</p><p>Charlene will give us the information about the Stray Devils since she has access to the information of Falbium.</p><p>Victoria will search for the targets using her ability which she has been studying using the nerfed version of my Archmage Essence and has progressed more.</p><p>Finally Cleria will be wrecking some havoc. I have already thought of a way to hide her identity. She will be using the Amon House Trait that I have in my possession.</p><p>The House Traits of the other houses will be used in these hunts to throw off the trail and leave false trails.</p><p>This will cause several internal problems and lack of trust in the already shady bunch of the Old Satan Faction people.</p><p>The Old Satan Faction will be facing a team of undying Ultimate Class devils out for blood.</p><p>Katerea has already collected the names of several people and information about various bases to target.</p><p>The attack will start in a month or so after Cleria finishes reigning in control of her new powers and reaches at least a Mid Ultimate Class stage with it.</p><p>But I have to take several measures before this and I have just an idea in my mind.</p><p><strong>- Eleven Months Later –</strong></p><p>I walked out of the room and washed the blood off of my hands.</p><p>The place developed by Shalba to conduct experiments to create Super Devils and increase the power of the devils is extremely disgusting.</p><p>Dozens of test subjects of different breeds are in this lab.</p><p>This place used anything from new medicines and serums to King Pieces to obtain an increase in power.</p><p>I am actually surprised that the Old Satan Faction was shown to be so weak or was destroyed so easily in canon because right now the average power of the people following the Old Satan Faction is almost double that of the current government.</p><p>Some of these methods have extremely high efficiency although the side effects leave much to be warranted – not that Shalba would worry about it.</p><p>So how did I come here in the first place though?</p><p>I realized that I had encountered a roadblock in the development of my Illusion Technique. Almost every race has a different type of energy inside them and the versatility needed to mold all these types of energies into the illusion of my choice is extremely tough to achieve. This could only be achieved through ceaseless experimentations. And what place better to acquire test subjects for the experiments….and maybe even some future recruitments.</p><p>So I approached Shalba and asked for help because I wanted to learn torture and interrogation techniques.</p><p>Although maybe a little bit hesitantly, I was granted access to the dungeons of the Old Satan Faction first.</p><p>It was like I had won a lottery.</p><p>Prisoners of almost every race imaginable were present there.</p><p>The simple variety and background of many people present here was astounding. Starting from other devils to even Demigods are all present.</p><p>I even learned that in all these years many of the prisoners have died but some of these prisoners have been kept here since the time before the Great War and there were many Devils who belonged to the houses which were assumed to be extinct by everyone.</p><p>Too bad I only had one Binder Essence slot open right now after my birthday as one of them was used on Lavinia a few months ago so I had to choose.</p><p>I did choose one.</p><p>She was just too perfect to let go.</p><p>Celine is an Eight Winged Fallen Angel who has been here since the end of the last Great War.</p><p>Her mind was on the brink of destruction and she was almost a hollow at this point but this is something I simply couldn’t allow to happen.</p><p>Celine was not an ordinary Eight Winged Fallen Angel.</p><p>Nope.</p><p>She was a second generation Angel originally.</p><p>The daughter of the Great Seraph Uriel or the Holy Flames, one of the four Archangels of the Heavens.</p><p>She inherited her father’s Holy Flames and was a major power during the Great War. This however attracted the attention of some Fallen Angels who ambushed her and her team. Her entire team was raped, tortured and killed in front of her eyes but she was spared. She heard each of their cries, saw each of them pleading and witnessed the lights fade from their eyes all the while the other Fallen Angels laughed and held her down, taunted her and jeered at her. Almost everything was done to simply make her feel despair.</p><p>Safe to say that she snapped and she snapped <em>hard</em>.</p><p>Emotions surged and her Holy Flames burned through everything as she let her rage take over and completely lost herself in it for the sake of vengeance.</p><p>She succeeded. Each and every Fallen in the area had died a horrible death <a href=\"https://but….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">but….it</a> was too late for her.</p><p>Celine had already Fallen from God’s grace.</p><p>Her wings had turned black the moment she gave into rage having fallen to the sin of Wrath.</p><p>She had returned with the bodies of her deceased comrades back to Heaven but was not allowed to enter.</p><p>Even the Angels who had fallen during the torture were disallowed for their remains to even enter the gates of Heaven.</p><p>The one who had stopped her….was her own father Uriel.</p><p>It was safe to say that Celine was utterly lost at the point.</p><p>And people wonder why the biblical Heaven is currently the weakest Faction.</p><p> It was as if the Biblical God never even considered the possibility of his death. What would happen if he died?</p><p>For someone who preached forgiveness, he threw his own so-called <em>children </em>away for a single mistake….just because he could simply make others easily.</p><p>I mean imagine humans doing the same. What would happen if all parents started disowning children right after their first mistake?</p><p>There wasn’t even a trial or a hearing or anything. They were just abandoned.</p><p>The biblical Heaven’s system was extremely faulty.</p><p>Lucifer had once said that God threw him out because he was the most similar to him. Too prideful to admit that his perfect creations were not so perfect after all, to admit that he, God, had failed at something. After all, he was also not immune to anger and other sins or else why did he put all his malice, hatred and anger into the curses of Samael making him the abomination he was.</p><p>He too made a mistake and was still mutilated to such an extent.</p><p>I had considered it a bias from Lucifer’s point of view….but now….seeing things like this, makes me question everything.</p><p>There are always two sides of a coin. Some people might say that the Biblical God did everything for the good of humans, but these same people forget what he did to the other races. Albion’s account just gave me a new point of view. Even his own children as he called his creations, the Angels had their emotions almost completely restrained at the threat of falling.</p><p>I mean what kind of stupid rule forbids a girl from getting angry when they are being sexually assaulted.</p><p>The saying that the darkest of the shadows is beneath the brightest of the lights has never hit harder than this before.</p><p>Celine refused to join the Fallen Angels because of what was done to her comrades. She hated the entire Heaven Faction with all her heart. Unfortunately all this didn’t save her from the fires of the Great War.</p><p>She was captured by the previous Beelzebub and had been in this prison ever since.</p><p>Beelzebub and later some of his descendants had taken centuries torturing her, almost leaving her a soulless husk of her previous self.</p><p>This is how I found her.</p><p>What attracted my attention first were her wings. That said it was still common. What really made me turn to her was her non reaction to my illusions.</p><p>Illusions which could make even Satan Class like Katerea crumble on her knees had no effect on her at all.</p><p>This was the main reason why I started to research her and found out about her history.</p><p>I bound her without any hesitation. There was simply no resistance.</p><p>The link of the Binder made it possible for me to probe into her mind which she offered no resistance to at all and start the process of healing.</p><p>I had no idea about healing someone’s mind at all and such a thing was not even a specialty of the devils who simply focused on destruction.</p><p>I asked my subordinates to look for a mind healer for supernatural races and found to my surprise that Youkai are extremely good at this.</p><p>Kuroka’s training is progressing at a very fast pace and she was introduced to the Eastern Youkai with Nurarihyon being acquainted with her mother, she was easily taken in to be taught about Senjutsu and Youjutsu.</p><p>Although this happened only two months ago, her progress made her a favourite of Magari, a seven tailed Nekomata Youkai who is an expert in both the arts. Through her, I found out that Youkai can also heal mental traumas with the application of Senjutsu and Youjutsu.</p><p>This was actually developed to treat those youkai who were injured in battle or had sustained mental injuries due to the use of Fear.</p><p>I just have to carry Celine out to those people and they will help her is what Kuroka has assured me.</p><p>The encounter with the different races helped me increase my Illusion Magic to a new level.</p><p>I however met with another problem.</p><p>The Fidelius part of the spell caused a load on my soul for every person who was put under an Illusion. I could only keep so many secrets. So, I had to remove that part completely. Back to the drawing board.</p><p>Four months later I was given access to the labs of Shalba when he saw that I was actually only learning interrogation and torture techniques maybe to try and get closer to me and was more interested in their biology.</p><p>He had been hesitating to make closer contacts with me due to an incident that took place soon after Aria’s death.</p><p>I had burned Katerea Leviathan in a spar. She had the arms completely scorched when my flames tore through her Sea Serpent of the End. If not for that, she would have been a black scorch mark on the wall behind her.</p><p>It was a move we both had decided for her to slowly drift away from me. If she had suddenly started avoiding me, people would have doubted.</p><p>So, I made a plan where she was ‘teaching’ me how to behave because I had been moody after Aria’s death. The spar was something beyond her and she started avoiding me afterwards.</p><p>It was quite acceptable too. A centuries old Devil, the descendant of the Satan Leviathan was defeated by an eleven year old, even by a fluke.</p><p>Actually the only reason it was even believable was because that eleven year old was me.</p><p>Also Katerea was also slightly holding back. However now in the eyes of the others, she was avoiding me because of her pride.</p><p>Shalba didn’t want any baked bees so he was maintaining a safe distance from me.</p><p>This however didn’t stop him from providing me with anything I needed.</p><p>The labs in this place produced the Enhancement Drug which I was being injected with. I was actually interested in it as well.</p><p>I wanted to see exactly what was used to make it and if I could improve it further with my Mad Doctor Essence….after I left this place.</p><p>The analysis made me want to bang my head on the lab’s tables.</p><p>I finally understood why even after 200 doses of the Enhancement Drug, the effect was so reduced in my case. I mean sure, I was actually becoming the strongest devil ever recorded to have such amounts of Demonic Power at my age but still, even with the acquired resistances from the repeated uses of the Drug and my Mad Doctor Essence, the effect was lower than I had expected.</p><p>The reason was extremely simple.</p><p>The Enhancement Drug used the blood of the previous Satans and some other chemicals which threw the user’s DNA into an excited state and then tried to integrate a part of the Satan’s DNA into them to increase their demonic powers. It was basically what Madara and Danzo did with Hashirama cells and just like Hashirama’s cells being too strong and killing the users, the Original Satan’s blood killed the random devils. It was just too much for their untrained bodies to endure and it gave way.</p><p>I however was different because whereas others were trying to get close to the Original Satan’s DNAs, I was MADE from their blood directly.</p><p>I was already the closest possible in fact my DNA was stronger than both the Original Lucifer and Asmodeus. When the drug was being injected into me, my DNA was being attacked by the Original Satans that tried to take over but were not strong. My body however became resistant to those assaults and strengthened itself even further.</p><p>These idiots were trying to increase the purity of 100% pure material by mixing it with a 75% pure drug. Pure geniuses.</p><p>My sarcasm would have drowned them in shame if I actually revealed any of this information. I however didn’t want to become a blood donor for the next Enhancement Drug experiments and thus simply kept quiet.</p><p>While I was spending my time in the labs, Gretel was in my house with Vienna.</p><p>The house was something we had separated two weeks later and I had taken Vienna with me. The last house had so many memories of Aria that none of the three of us were ready to face right now.</p><p>Razevan tried to simply stay away from my place. In fact I had only seen him a handful of times since the funeral and none of them were when we were alone.</p><p>It was something that each of us three appreciated.</p><p>On the other hand, the attacks on the Old Satan Faction were getting larger. Cleria had really let it go after the first four times.</p><p>In these last ten months of hunting, she and her peerage of four members had taken down over seventy Stray Devils and made thirty eight of them sign and give up their powers. They were getting better with each attack and had a torture regime in place that broke their enemies and had them sign contracts easily.</p><p>Now some might wonder just how much power would someone need?</p><p>To understand this, let us first remember the levels of powers.</p><p>Low, Mid, High, Ultimate, Satan, Super Classes of Devils.</p><p>Now each level was divided into five parts. Low, Mid, High, Peak and Borderline next Class.</p><p>Each of these sublevels were the multiples of the low level of the Class.</p><p>For example a Mid Ultimate Class devil had two times the Demonic Power of a Low Ultimate Class Devil while a High Ultimate Class Devil had three times the Demonic Powers.</p><p>So to increase from a Low to a Mid Level, even in the same class meant doubling someone’s entire Demonic Power reserves.</p><p>It was the reason why A Peak Satan Class like Serafall was one of the Satans while the same was true for a High Satan Class like Falbium. Grayfia was also at High Satan Class, while Diehauser was barely at Mid Satan Class.</p><p>The Satan descendants had a higher amount of Demonic Powers by birth and still were only at low Satan Class to Mid Satan Class at <a href=\"https://best….in\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">best….in</a> terms of Demonic Powers….not skill.</p><p>I am at a Low Satan Class right now only in terms of Demonic Powers. The youngest to have achieved this level as even Sirzechs and Ajuka had reached this level only in their teenage years although they were born with Ultimate Class reserves from the start.</p><p>The only difference is between the Super Devils because that would mean at least ten times stronger than a Peak Satan Class devils, which is what the Original Satans were.</p><p>There were barely just a handful of Ultimate Class Stray Devils. Devils of those levels were already accommodated quite well and the Strays normally didn’t survive till they became that strong.</p><p>The thirty eight Stray Devils however pushed her peerage of four all to an average of low Ultimate Class while Cleria herself is at a High Ultimate Class level. One has to remember that an Ultimate Class Devil with the Absolute Demise is a force of nature itself.</p><p>The entire Old Satan Faction was as if their asses were on fire. Each of their bases were now being filled with Ultimate Class devils and they were only allowed to leave when their posts were taken by another of the same rank.</p><p>In the last two months four Old Satan Faction’s bases were destroyed. I made it a point to target the houses using the House Traits of the other supporter Houses of the Old Satan Faction.</p><p>At first there was a speculation that someone had gone rogue but as the attacks persisted and more bases were attacked, the situation became extremely volatile.</p><p>Rizevim himself downright rejected coming out to take care of this matter. His exact words were – Some kids are spreading evil. Who am I to stop them?</p><p>It basically meant, I am having too much fun seeing all of you suffer so fuck off already.</p><p>We were lucky enough to gain 2 Ultimate Class and 7 High Class Devils’ allegiance in these. These bastards were extremely cowardly and even their powers from experiments and drugs and they gave up as soon as Cleria Nullified their attacks. I have four more of the House Traits from the Seventy Two Pillars now.</p><p>“Damien.” I turned back to see Shalba approaching me along with a few other Ultimate Class Devils. “Are the studies going well?” he asked, making small talk.</p><p>“Hmm….Yes. This place has been very helpful to my studies. Thank you for allowing me to use it.” I slightly bowed towards him and he nodded back tersely to me.</p><p>“I wanted to discuss some matters of importance with you.” he slightly hesitated but I nodded to continue.</p><p>“As you might have already heard, the attacks on our Faction have been increasing in the past few months. We think that someone is rebelling or it might just be a move from the fakes to try and destroy our faction before we can resurface. Many places need to be protected until we can upgrade our security and hunt down the attackers with our own teams. Each major base needs a Satan Class Devil and we want you to protect one of our Russian bases. You can take four Ultimate Class devils along with you and a dozen High Class devils. If possible capture, if not then no need to hold back. Kill anyone who attacks the base.”</p><p>Well well….now isn’t this a great opportunity.</p><p>“Okay….when do I have to leave?” I asked without much thought.</p><p>“As soon as possible.” He answered.</p><p>“I need a few hours to prepare. Can I get the list of people who I can recruit?” I asked after thinking for a moment.</p><p>Shalba pointed towards his lackey who brought out a file of the people under the Old Satan Faction and I had to sigh at the stupidity of these idiots. No wonder they lost the war so badly.</p><p>“I will be taking Gretel and Vienna. So three Ultimate Class and eleven High Class devils need to be chosen. I will send you a list in an hour or two.” I accepted the file and walked teleported to my new house.</p><p><em>“Ophelia.”</em> I immediately contacted Ophelia through our link.</p><p><em>“Yes Master.”</em></p><p><em>“Give me the names of three Ultimate Class Devils and a dozen High Class devils that you think will be the most beneficial as thralls.”</em></p><p><em>“Master?”</em></p><p><em>“Names Ophelia. I need the names of people you want eliminated or thralled by us. I am being assigned to protect a base and have to submit a list of names. Give me the names as well as a reason each for why they need to be removed and a reason for me to give Shalba to recruit the said people. Make it ready in an hour.”</em></p><p><em>“Cleria.”</em></p><p><em>“Young Lord.”</em></p><p><em>“Among the new group of thralls and stray devils, prepare the strongest but disposable ones and make them sign the suicide contracts. I want you to prepare a team of five or more Ultimate Class devils and over a dozen High Class devils for an attack on a base in Russia. None of them will be returning.”</em></p><p>The Suicide contracts were contracts which basically stated that all the power of the donor will be transferred over to the contracts on the event of their deaths and they will be transferred over to whoever signs them later.</p><p>These contracts took more effort to make than the normal ones but the true power of the contracts is truly broken. The only flaw being that the user has to sign the contract after knowing about the exact contents of the contract which makes it nearly impossible for anyone to want to sign.</p><p>“Who will be in that base, Young Lord? Is it one of the leaders?” she asked lightly intrigued.</p><p>“I will be guarding the base with Gretel and Vienna.”</p><p>_________________________________x__________________________________________________________________x_________________________________</p><p><strong>Beta Reader: LuluViBritania(FF.N, SB and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th BritannianEmperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note :</strong></p><p><strong>Phew, finally done.</strong></p><p><strong>I was going to make this chapter much shorter but the last part kinda kept on going.

    "content": "<p><strong>Disclaimer : I own nothing.</strong></p><p><strong>Chapter 6 : Rising tensions.</strong></p><p><strong>- Damien –</strong></p><p>Me acquiring Dimension Lost, an indirect encounter with Rizevim and meeting Kuroka and Shirone were far from the only incident in the last year though.</p><p>Soon after that another incident happened that I had known was about to happen.</p><p>The execution of Cleria Belial.</p><p>It happened just as I had known it to happen. The love story of star crossed lovers meeting a bad end. I kind of wanted to call out the shit on Sirzechs and Grayfia because of this.</p><p>It did cause a massive political shit storm and while not direct, I did contribute to it as well through rumors that Zekram Bael was attacking Diehauser Belial because he was not on his side and such. These rumors were spread by people through discrete sources that had been planted months before the execution had even taken place and were just waiting to be triggered at the correct moment.</p><p>The rumors stated that Cleria merely wanted to recruit a Knight and a Holy Sword wielder like Masaomi Yaegaki was an excellent option.</p><p>Zekram Bael however feared the Belial’s getting such a power and had organized it. It did hold weight because seducing church members to the devil’s side was not something new.</p><p>I heard from Alicia as well as Ophelia that the Satans were running around in circles like mad dogs trying to find the source of the rumors to no avail.</p><p>The rumors also gained weight because it was accompanied by several other well hidden facts that were buried away and could cause massive reputation damage to the Great King faction.</p><p>They were naturally incensed and on not finding anything, they started targeting Diehauser but couldn’t make any overt move in fear of provoking a bad image.</p><p>Now while I personally don’t have anything against the Great King or the new Satans, it is also a fact that if my identity is revealed, I would become one of their most sought-after targets in an instant. The Great King faction would especially be threatened by my very existence and would do anything to remove me permanently or bring me under their control, more chances of the former.</p><p>That will just not work in my favour when I am out of the Old Satan Faction and on my own. This is why I am trying to undermine their credibility among the common populace as much as possible and make a network that can oppose that of the Great King Faction.</p><p>Political and social assassinations are very common among the high class society like these.</p><p>Diehauser was however supported by many other houses due to his reputation and thus was relatively unharmed from all scandals. I personally think that now that a scandal had been caused and there were blames being made on their names, Zekram personally backed down in fear if Diehauser knew and revealed about the King Pieces.</p><p>This however was not the correct time.</p><p>The implications of this incident were that Diehauser Belial had grown disillusioned with the current government and had joined the Old Satan Faction siding with Rizevim….to spy for me.</p><p>I had taken the opportunity to revive Cleria because she was bound by The Binder’s Essence and thus her soul was under my control.</p><p>Diehauser had almost blown a gasket when he had seen a revived Cleria due to him thinking that someone was using her disguise to mock him. Thankfully Cleria’s use of the Worthless calmed him down although it left him utterly confused. Everyone had witnessed the death of Cleria Belial with their own eyes.</p><p>She then proceeded to state things that only the two of them knew thus solidifying her identity. Safe to say Diehauser Belial was confused as fuck. I couldn’t talk to him directly either. So Cleria had to convince him that she was safe and was protected by someone(namely me).</p><p>He did put off signing or pledging his loyalty towards me, that said Cleria has repeatedly reassured me of his support. That however didn’t make me angry though. If anything I now had even more respect for Diehauser Belial. Not that I will be revealing myself to him anytime soon. I would like to keep myself a secret till I am sure of it.</p><p>Respecting someone and trusting someone are two completely different things.</p><p>Finally he decided to move on his own. His reason was that if the Great King Faction were responsible for his sister’s death and the reason due to which she had to pretend to be dead even after being brought back to life, then he would bring them to their knees. It was quite different from what it had been originally but something that I actually appreciated nonetheless.</p><p>He joined with the Old Satan Faction and worked with them ultimately to use them as a means to get his sister justice.</p><p>And that is where the twist happened.</p><p>As Rizevim was already trying to separate me from Katerea but there hadn’t been a good enough replacement for her(who would fucking dare), Shalba and Creuserey were smart enough to stay aside while Euclid doesn’t come anywhere near me since the last incident. Now with the appearance of Diehauser Belial, this changed completely.</p><p>No one could complain about Diehauser’s competency in magic or even teaching. The title of ‘The Emperor’ was enough to put down any objections at all.</p><p>So I got my new teacher in strategy and advanced magical theory as well as live combat….and I couldn’t be any happier.</p><p>The first meeting between me and my new teacher was amusing for both of us as it suddenly appeared out of nowhere….unknown to both of us. Rizevim thought that he had pulled a prank on us. Putting a suspicious newcomer and me in a situation like that to test out both of us. And that too right after the whole drama about spies. If that wasn’t mocking me, then I had no idea what it was.</p><p>That fucker.</p><p><strong>- Flashback –</strong></p><p>I had been interrupted from my usual training and was called out to meet Rizevim. It was supposed to be my training with Katerea soon.</p><p>The old butler had been outside my door and had escorted me to the meeting place.</p><p>Three people were waiting in the room for me. Rizevim, Katerea and another man whom I identified only through pictures and videos.</p><p>“Oh Damien, you are here. Come on in. Meet your new teacher ‘The Emperor’ Diehauser Belial.” He waved his hands towards Diehauser who had slightly raised eyebrows and was hiding his surprise quite well with it. “And Diehauser, meet your new student, Damien Lucifer.” Now that got his attention.</p><p>“Lucifer?” he asked, surprised.</p><p>“Yes yes….Lucifer. To be more precise Damien Lucifer Asmodeus…. created from the blood of my dear <em>Father</em> and uncle Asmodeus, a satanic miracle child if you will.” His words were almost as if he was singing with happiness while Diehauser finally had wide eyes as he looked at me.</p><p>“T-that….” Katerea started to speak but a single gaze from Rizevim shut her up.</p><p>“Are you doubting my choices Katerea?” his voice was simple and smooth with almost no change of tone from his previous jovial one yet the warning was still clear.</p><p>“N-no Lord Rizevim.” She stuttered and backed off.</p><p>I for myself was pushing my Occlumency to the best of my ability to keep a neutral expression.</p><p>Revealing my identity to someone just out of the blue was….</p><p>“Now Damien listen carefully. Diehauser here will teach you about House Traits, Strategies, Advanced Magical theories as well as combat. While Katerea is a very capable teacher, there are very few who know magical theories and House Traits as well as Diehauser.” Rizevim chided. “Say, do you accept? Of course you accept. Who wouldn’t want The Champion of Rating Games as a teacher.”</p><p>Although his patronizing tone was annoying, none of his logic could be refuted at all.</p><p>Katerea will still find a way to bring me for classes but this would most definitely reduce our time together by a lot.</p><p>I put the thoughts aside and nodded slightly towards the surprised Belial who nodded back in reply. “I would be glad for anything I can learn from Lord Belial.”</p><p>I ignored the hurt look from Katerea right now because if I completely disregarded Rizevim’s opinion and threw a tantrum here, it would make him doubt Ophelia’s brainwashing….that’s if he is not doing so right now.</p><p>It was fascinating how much she had learned to act in all this time. Normally she would have been happy to stay away from me but now she knows that I have involved her too much and if we get caught now, she will not be forgiven at all and will die with me.</p><p><strong>- End of the Flashbacks –</strong></p><p>Since then I have spent the last eight months being taught by Diehauser and it has only served to increase my respect for the man even more.</p><p>The man was an absolute genius and equally hard working as well.</p><p>I hadn’t known anyone to deconstruct unique abilities be it House Traits or absolutely unreasonable Sacred Gear abilities to overcome them with worthless.</p><p>I had a wonderful opportunity to analyse the Worthless ability too.</p><p>It worked by eliminating a vital part of the Magic. Like imagine if a sequence of steps are needed for a certain result to occur, the Worthless just disrupts the sequence by completely removing a part of the sequence.</p><p>This would also explain the weakness of Worthless. First being that the user has to know everything about the type of magic being cast.</p><p>Now imagine a fire spell. Even if one doesn’t understand every step of the spell, they can still remove the component used to increase the kinetic energy of the surroundings and thus making it powerless instantly.</p><p>Obviously without accurate targeting, a large part of the spell has to be overcome and thus a large amount of energy is required, which is coincidentally the second part of weakness – the amount of Energy.</p><p>There is a reason why Diehauser can’t just Worthless Sirzechs or Rizevim. He simply can’t match them in power.</p><p>Ajuka would however simply outmatch him in processing speed and amount of magic he can use before the question of power even comes to place.</p><p>I had been looking into developing this ability for a long time now and with a front row seat to it, I just had to do it.</p><p>I can use Worthless now. The analyzing part of the ability was taken care of by my Archmage Essence and as for power….I think I will have enough of that in time.</p><p>Then came Strategy and combat classes.</p><p>Diehauser was a master of strategies as seen in his Rating Games. The King Essence made me able to adapt to it very quickly and it was honestly extremely helpful.</p><p>Until now I hadn’t had a chance to learn these in detail. It was definitely the most productive period of time I spent here.</p><p>As for our personal relationship, he tried to remain professional as much as possible, trying not to make emotional connection with me. A wise decision too.</p><p>Rizevim wouldn’t have let any weakness go by.</p><p>That however changed once when Gretel and Vienna joined us.</p><p>It was something that I had taken up on myself.</p><p>It started when Vienna, who was now eight years old, had asked to be taught magic. I had been teaching her exercises about Occlumency till now but real magic was something that needed the House Crest.</p><p>I didn’t think I could teach Vienna to control her Demonic Power enough to cast magic all the while hiding her abilities from everyone. She was still a child and she was one of the few people on whom I wouldn’t enforce the loyalty of my Binder’s Mark. That was there only to protect her life in case Rizevim or anyone else did something. The others being Aria and Gretel.</p><p>So I could only wait for the Lucifer Crest to be applied to Vienna. I could technically force Katerea to use the Leviathan Crest on Vienna but the amount of bullshit that would cause not to mention the questions it would raise were not worth it. The same was the case with any other self-invented Crests.</p><p>Vienna had been very cheerful about learning ‘Real Magic’ as the cheeky brat had called it. Occlumency being boring….not that I denied it though. Occlumency had been boring without a doubt.</p><p>All that had come to crash when Razevan the fucker had denied it altogether.</p><p>‘She will be taught with the other children of the servants when she is ten.’</p><p>I wanted to rip off that utter bastard’s tongue when I heard that. Shalba and Creuserey agreeing to it didn’t help the matters either.</p><p>Katerea also had to keep up with the façade.</p><p>Vi almost had tears in her eyes while she was clenching her fingers.</p><p>They had done so in front of the servants after all.</p><p>The servants laughing and trying to show their approval to kiss their asses was what made her cry finally.</p><p>She looked at me at that instant, looking at her teary eyes, I felt something crack inside of me and let out something that I had thought I had finally gained control over….Conqueror’s Haki rumbled and the mob characters fainted, the glasses and the wooden furniture in the room cracked as Razevan skipped a breath while the other three took a few steps back in shock.</p><p>“Why are you laughing?” I looked towards a servant on his knees heaving for breaths. “A child with Lucifer’s blood will be taught with servants? Since when did we fall so low? Such an insult will not be tolerated by me. I will look over her studies myself.” and with that said, I left the room taking Vi with me.</p><p>Not giving anyone any time to say otherwise.</p><p>Since then I had taken up all the responsibility for teaching Vi. Gretel, as my personal aide, helped too.</p><p>She teaches basic Magical Theory and Elemental Magic to Vi while I help her with Occlumency and mind magic. We have decided to keep these two magic as the only ones to teach her for now. mind magic will be much more useful to her than anything else….whether it be keeping calm herself or to overcome the wills of all the previous wielders of her sacred gear.</p><p>She accompanies us when Diehauser teaches me magic along with Gretel but she sits on the side only listening to everything that is being taught.</p><p>The nerfed Archmage Essence helps her understand magic much better than normal.</p><p>When Diehauser found out about Vi’s situation and that I had taken it upon myself to teach her, although he didn’t show it outwardly, I sensed his emotions and all of it was respect and approval for my action. This was also a reason why he allowed Vi to stay with me and Gretel during the class.</p><p>This also brought our relationship closer. Although nothing was said outwardly, his behaviour had subtle changes.</p><p> The other significant progress happened after four months of that.</p><p>This time by another one of those five girls, Victoria Valac.</p><p>She was honestly one of the most cheat existences I had ever seen.</p><p>Like seriously, the Clan Trait of the Valac was utter fucking bullshit.</p><p>The Seeker’s Eye had been rare and rarely strong enough to be of significance. Except for the first Valac, the others hadn’t really measured up to the mark.</p><p>Victoria however was a unique case because she actually had a decently strong Trait. Despite her average demonic power reserves, which most of the foolish devils considered as the measure of power, she was absolutely flawless.</p><p>A light blonde with blue eyes who had what a lot of new devils lacked nowadays, patience and common sense. I like her especially because she is someone who could plan for the long term and choose allies whom she can trust(if we leave the cases of The Binder’s Essence) out of it. Then again, that might have something to do with her Trait too.</p><p>Seeker’s Eyes helped lead the user to whatever they desired. A simple pull depending on how strong their Trait is.</p><p>It reminded me of the compass of Jack Sparrow.</p><p>She was the key to my next plan to search for sacred gear users. Like Vienna, some of the others might have changed so I had no idea who might be who.</p><p>Victoria’s presence helped narrow down the line of search by a lot.</p><p>This led me to my next target.</p><p>This time however I didn’t leave to meet them myself but sent Cleria for the job. Lavinia Reni was recruited on her way to Grauzauberer with the promise that she will be helped to find the whereabouts of Augusta, the Witch of the East and will be helped find any information about Glenda.</p><p>I had known some of it from my knowledge of the novels but Glenda, The Witch of the South of ‘The Wizards of Oz’ had taken Lavinia as an apprentice with the intent of studying her Sacred Gear. She however had pretended to be a kind and loving mother to her and had trained her as an apprentice….only till she had completed the research. After that she had sent her away to Grauzauberer with an excuse of making friends while she had faked her death at the hands of Augusta. Later her research had been used by the strays of the Five Principal Clans, the Utsusemi agency to create Utsusemis.</p><p>All the while Lavinia herself searched the world for her teacher’s supposed killer.</p><p>Now, the story in this world might be different. Vi being a girl alone had changed a lot of things so relying on the knowledge of the future won’t help unless in special cases.</p><p>It had been easy to collect the information about those people if you had sources and after providing some of it to Lavinia, it was easy to make her agree to collaborate with the Belial devil.</p><p>Cleria, who had supposedly died, still had her Evil Pieces because it was ‘lost’ before her execution and since she was ‘dead’ no one could summon the pieces back. Then again those pieces couldn’t be used by anyone other than Cleria so the devils were not really worried about it either.</p><p>Cleria used both of her Bishops to reincarnate Lavinia as a Bishop under her, the Devil heritage empowering her further and increasing her magical reserves.</p><p>This had happened four months ago and since then Diehauser had been teaching both Cleria and Lavinia magic aside from me. For Cleria it was simply so that his sister could live peacefully. I haven’t had the opportunity to visit them yet but I do plan to do so soon. I just have to find an opportunity for it.</p><p>The other Longinus Wielders are all in areas that are under surveillance which makes it difficult for me to reach them right now or in places that I have no idea about. Apart from the Longinus, the other top Class Pieces or Hero descendants are already under other powers or hidden.</p><p>Dulio had somehow gotten under the church’s eyes and was taken in almost instantly. Same was the case when the child holding the spirit of the ‘Maiden of Orleans’ had been discovered.</p><p>I had no luck trying to find Cao Cao so he was probably already taken in by Indra or Sun Wukong. Kuoh is currently under extremely high surveillance. Hopefully my next targets are reachable.</p><p>Not being able to leave much is becoming a massive problem for me.</p><p>I did get another task started while inside this place though.</p><p>Gathering and inspecting the servants of the Old Leviathan who were loyal to her and had a noble status. Then inspect if any of them had a business in healing or medical services. The names of the hospitals in the areas of those nobles and their own personal details.</p><p>The goal this time was to find Ingvild Leviathan.</p><p>This world had two of the three strongest beings being Dragons. Ingvild’s power was extremely attractive to anyone even if you discounted her ability as a Leviathan Descendant and High Satan Class demonic power itself. She was just too much of a prize.</p><p>Information about said Devil was not available though. It was almost as if she didn’t exist because none of the Old Leviathan’s servants actually betrayed her. Some of them did stay back but they still worked for the Old Satan Faction. Thus, I could only conclude that whoever it is that was hiding Ingvild had hidden her from even the Old Satan Faction and Katerea….which was actually a wise decision.</p><p>Seeing how Vienna would have been treated if not for me, I would actually like to praise the nobles who hid Ingvild actually.</p><p>The search had been carried out by Ophelia this time. It was the task that I had assigned her. I also asked her to get me the list of all the devils diagnosed with the Sleeping Disease.</p><p>The disease was EXTREMELY rare.</p><p>And from what I have found, it is neither genetic or communicable.</p><p>I didn’t have a lab to study it but the cases of the disease were easy to spot because of the sheer rarity of the disease.</p><p>I had asked Ophelia to covertly gather as much information as possible about any patients.</p><p>On the other hand I did find some extremely interesting facts about the Disease itself. Or rather than calling them facts (because I cannot verify them for myself right now) it is better to call them….observations.</p><p>I did find out a surprising fact that almost 40% of the affected people were either political opponents of the Great King Faction or neutrals.</p><p>Then the fact that the first case of this disease was found after the death of the Original Satans and before the Civil War and has continued on till today.</p><p>Misla Bael conveniently gets affected by the disease after she is ousted from the Bael House.</p><p>I searched my memory for other patients and found that in the future even Lord Sitri is affected by the disease.</p><p>Now some would wonder why Lord Sitri if the current Satans are also sided with the Great King faction.</p><p>Well that assumption would be a false one because the Great King Faction doesn’t mean the Great King himself.</p><p>The Faction consists of hardcore devil traditionalists who believe in blood supremacy of the devils above all. In simple words, stuck up old men, too used to being in a position of power to know the reality of the new world.</p><p>They have engaged in more than a fair share of their own shady deals. After all, the economic situation is also a factor in being a Pillar House. There are currently eight suitable Houses which have Pure Blooded Houses which can easily be revived but are not because that would mean distribution of power and no one likes to lose power, especially not old dudes with a mile long pole up their asses. Second, they don’t have enough money for it.</p><p>Yeah, blood supremacy was ultimately a farce to keep most of the economic profit to themselves.</p><p>Now where Lord Sitri factors in all this is Sona. Her School would have made it so that many low, middle and reincarnated Devils would have done well in Rating Games and made the higher positions harder to rigg with a handful of King Pieces.</p><p>Him dying suddenly would have led to a massive problem too. So he oh so conveniently fell into the Sleeping Disease and Sona was forced to become Lady Sitri thus diverting her attention from the Rating Game School for the low, middle and the reincarnated Devils.</p><p>Conspiracy Theory? Maybe. I would still like to err on the side of caution.</p><p>This disease needs a cure and I need to somehow contact all the Pure Blooded Devils of the ‘Extinct Houses’ to perhaps make a better support system.</p><p>They can make decent candidates for the Sacred Gears that I have been collecting all this while.</p><p>I mean as strong as Humans can be, Pure Blooded Devils have a natural advantage over them and I am not going to give up any advantages to myself on the account of devils being evil. I have seen and know for a fact that in this world Devils are just like humans in terms of thought process.</p><p>Humans can be just as corrupt if not more if provided with opportunity.</p><p>No need to beat myself up over a redundant moral dilemma now.</p><p>I had more important things to concentrate on.</p><p>I looked at Vienna throwing around a wave of ice magic at the Training dummy(ughh), no pun intended. Although she has only been learning for four months, she has progressed a lot.</p><p>Divine Dividing’s training can only progress slowly for now. We are all too strong for her to divide right now and thus we can only make a magic directly for her to try and divide.</p><p>Believe me, trying to put your hand directly in any kind of offensive magic is hard to do. Much harder than just touching the user and dividing their power.</p><p>Both Gretel and I are too strong for Vi to use her powers on directly so the only thing we can do is make blocks of ice that she tries to Divide till she is at the limit of her Demonic Power and then hold that state as much as possible, forcibly expanding the size of her energy reserves.</p><p>Although this training is well and good, there is another problem with it.</p><p>“BORINGGGGGGG. DUMMY, GIVE ME ANOTHER EXERCISE ALREADY. TEACH ME A COOL MAGIC.” Whined the adorable ball of fluff who is currently jumping all over the place.</p><p>I hadn’t encountered this with Gretel and had completely forgotten to consider this problem at all.</p><p>Vi was a child. Fortunately a child that was more or less shielded from most of the horrors of the place. Gretel had seen too much and had barely had a sense of self when I had first met her, thus when she got a chance to become something that could break through those shackles, she took it with both her hands. She had already been very mature….too mature due to her circumstances whereas Vi while still a little better than the other dumb kids of the Devils, still had her childishness.</p><p>It was something I was quite glad about. I wanted her to enjoy her childhood, at least as much as she could. The fact that the Essences helped her learn any magic taught at an incredible speed also didn’t help.</p><p>Children don’t really have the concept of mastering things.</p><p>According to her, if she can make ice, she has already learned Ice Magic.</p><p>“Tell you what Vi. If you can hit me using your Ice Magic in one minute, I will teach you another Magic.” I offered with a slight smile.</p><p>She brightened up for an instant but then soon frowned, “You are trying to trick me Dummy. You are too strong for me to hit.”</p><p>Ah….she has become smarter.</p><p>“Ow come on, I will even close my eyes and will only dodge without using any magic. Don’t tell me you can’t hit me even with a blindfold?” I mocked.</p><p>“Hahhh. A blindfold. Line up Dummy, I am going to kick your ass and then you will teach me cool magic.” She punched her palm with the other hand getting ready.</p><p>“Lady Vienna, you shouldn’t use such language.”</p><p>“But Gretel….see….Dummy was teasing me. It’s….it’s his fault.”</p><p>Ah….yeah. Somehow Vienna is afraid of Gretel’s lectures. She had told me in our private time that it was because she didn’t like seeing Gretel disappointed or wanted Gretel to hate her.</p><p>As for me, the little gremlin doesn’t think I will hate her for these things.</p><p>Hah….a child has me figured out and I want to beat the likes of Rizevim.</p><p>I sighed.</p><p>“You should still control yourself. You are the Young Lady of the prestigious Lucifer line. Please handle yourself in a suitable manner.” Gretel preached.</p><p>It was kinda funny to see an eight and half year old being scolded by a thirteen year old. It would have been funnier if I hadn't been in the body of an eleven year old.</p><p>I tied a blindfold to my eyes. “Okay ready when you are Vi.” I need more practice with my Observation Haki. This skill becomes stronger as I push it. Currently only the spars with Gretel and my clones in the rare cases when I am inside Katerea’s private grounds can help me.</p><p>While Gretel is nowhere near as strong as me, her Space Magic is very annoying. The prediction of those moves helps me push my Observation Haki further while helping Gretel make her techniques even more refined. Short distance teleportation, distorting the space of a certain area and then releasing it like a stretched rubber sheet to shatter anything in that area.</p><p>She has invented her own version of a Kamui-like attack. That shows the sheer genius she has in terms of space magic. She has been working on increasing the number of attacks and the invocation speed all this time. Now there are beings who can break space with their attacks, weapons that could replicate the same feat but….they are rare, very rare. Or the Dimension Lost wouldn’t be considered the strongest Defensive Type Sacred Gear. If she masters this technique, she will have a very strong and almost unavoidable type of attack for anyone who was lacking in a detection type technique.</p><p>She has even developed a few variations of this technique. Imagine pinching a sheet of rubber at a point and pulling it back and releasing it. I hadn’t known it could generate that much force. Apparently Gretel knew.</p><p>Her Space Bullet as she calls it to tear a hole through a ten meter Ice Wall she had made through her own Magic. A wall as strong as reinforced steel of four times the width.</p><p>Space Magic is such a cheat.</p><p>“Ready Dummy. Here I come” shouted Vi so loud that I wouldn’t have needed the Observation Haki to know her place.</p><p>The surprise however was when the attack came from the opposite direction.</p><p>The midget had tried to trick me much to my happiness.</p><p>I simply moved towards the left a little dodging it. “Tch tch tch….really Vi, I thought you had better aim than that.”</p><p>What followed was a shower of icicles around me while I danced in between them.</p><p>Her frustrations increased and her control over her attacks became weaker but the power behind them increased….although at the cost of more demonic power. However in a situation like now, where precision, speed and tactics were needed, it was bound to inevitably fail.</p><p>Soon after, the match was called off by Gretel but not before Vi threw a small car sized ice block at me.</p><p>I stepped out of the way and walked towards her as she collapsed on her knees breathing hard.</p><p>“You <em>huff</em> had to <em>huff</em> have been cheating. That blindfold <em>huff</em> was <em>huff</em> fake.” She pointed her finger at me indignantly.</p><p>I tied the blindfold on her eyes, shutting her up completely although she struggled to open it. I hugged her and sat on the floor, slowly caressing her hair.</p><p>“Tell you what. If you can master Ice Magic till the level Gretel teaches you to and learn Occlumency to defend against my attacks, I will teach you the technique I just used. Till now only I and Gretel know how to use Observation Haki and she was also taught by me. A special technique that was created by me. Don’t you want to learn this Vi?” she twitched and I continued, “To be able to fight even with your eyes closed. That would look so cool right?” I looked towards Gretel, “That’s a fair deal right Gretel?”</p><p>“Yes Master. The Occlumency lessons will also help Lady Vienna learn the technique faster.” She answered from my side.</p><p>I pulled her hand making her sit beside me and caressed her hair too.</p><p>She might show off the stoic face everywhere but she probably needed this more than Vienna or me.</p><p>“Promise?” Vi whispered, getting her breath together.</p><p>“Pinky promise.”</p><p>“Hah….who makes Pinky Promise. Are you a kid Dummy?”</p><p>….</p><p>This brat….I chuckled.</p><p>Although a little finger took hold of my own soon after.</p><p><em>“You should do that Vienna. The mind magic will help you handle more of my power without being influenced. Dragons are temperamental beings. That said people are like the steel of a blade, when they lose their temper, they lose their worth and power.”</em> commented the voice from Vienna’s wings as Albion joined the conversation.</p><p>I, despite myself, snorted at that “Like two dragons during the Great War.”</p><p><em>“Oh….please. As if they were preaching sermons about world peace there. They were fighting and so were we. The battlefields happened to coincide. Not much of a coincidence if you ask me considering how much of the whole world they were fighting in though. But that hypocritical old father of the Angels sealed us inside to ‘Empower Humanity’. What gave him the right to do so? What gave him the right to seal us? It is not as if they weren't killing and fighting? So, they can fight but we dragons cannot fight? If he wanted to empower humanity, he had more than enough angels which he could have sealed but….NO, I want to make a Super Powerful weapon which will help increase my influence on the people to make them pray more. And since the distribution is random, no one can sue me either. Well having fun with all that aren’t </em><a href=\"https://you….in\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">you….in</a><em> the bland afterlife.”</em> The old dragon went on a rant.</p><p>If I hadn’t known better I would have thought that Big G had accidentally sealed Lucifer inside the Divine Dividing or Albion somehow had a feud with Big G instead of Ddraig but they would be surprised at the amount of resentment that Albion had with the Creator of Heavens.</p><p>“You really hate Big G….or rather Grampa, I suppose don’t you?” I smirked in a good natured teasing.</p><p>After one gets through the rough exterior of the cold and aloof Dragon, he is one of the best people one can know….although my surrounding people here don’t exactly set the bar too high….but we can get the hint.</p><p>“He is a close second to Ddraig on my list of the most hated beings. He has done too many things, things that many don’t even know about to create the Sacred Gears. The lower class Gears like the Twice Critical have been made from the souls of young Welsh Dragons, the Sword Birth’s were made from the souls of Demonic Beasts….even so called Blacksmith of the Holy Swords, the Blade Blacksmith Sacred Gears were made with the souls of High Faes.”</p><p>“Faes? As in the Fairy Race? Weren’t they the allies of Heaven?” I asked surprised at the reveal.</p><p><em>“As if that self-centered person would ever have allies? He couldn’t even trust his own children. For someone who always preached forgiveness, he was too quick to throw his children out when it was inconvenient to his image.” the Dragon took a breath and continued, “The Faes had demanded that the Excalibur and other Holy Swords be returned to the Lady of the Lake for the arrival of a chosen one. The Biblical Heaven had outright denied it along with the church and declared the swords the property of the Church, just like the Norse swords. The Faes had protested and broke their alliance with them and isolated them in Avalon. Why do you think they cannot repair the broken Holy Swords? It was because they never made one in the first place. When some of the High Ranking Faes had come out to retrieve the swords, they were killed by the Church. The Creator of Heaven had then taken an opportunity to use those souls to make the Sacred Gears known as Blade Blacksmith to arm his people with Holy Swords against the Devils in the Great War. The Faes have since then isolated themselves from this world completely.” </em>The Dragon just casually revealed news that would break the faith of many people if disclosed.</p><p>Then again the simple fact that the God of the Bible was dead was already more than enough to do the job and much easier at that too.</p><p>“So the Fae are still alive?” I asked, interested in the subject.</p><p>I wasn’t taught about this in an….well unbiased manner so it was always nice to find another opinion on the matter.</p><p><em>“Oh they are safe for sure. I don’t think anyone can find them if they decided to hide in their little garden. No one can enter there without invitation either. This was the reason why they, despite not being a warrior race, survived so easily during the Great War while many spirits allied with Heaven didn’t live through the War.”</em> he said with complete surety in his tone.</p><p>It did give me much to think about.</p><p><strong>- Scene Change –</strong></p><p>I was taking a shower when I received the news of Alicia. <em>“There has been a development Young Lord.”</em> She said directly through the connection of The Binder’s Essence.</p><p><em>“What development?”</em> I asked while proceeding to turn off the shower and dry myself.</p><p><em>“Two hours ago, a child was admitted to a hospital under my family in Verona, Italy under the social service programs to help the poor. The child was diagnosed with an extremely powerful Sacred Gear at the levels of a Longinus.”</em> She hastily told me everything she had found out. <em>“A four to five year old child with grayish blue hair, tan skin, purple eyes and named Leonardo was brought to us by some social service workers. One of these people had reported that the parents of this child were poor workers in the construction sites around the town. The child was diagnosed with mild malnutrition along with a case of flu. What do you wish to do with the child?”</em></p><p>This was a way for me to search for Sacred Gears. I have asked all of my people to start groups to help people, especially children all over the world.</p><p>Making orphanages, introducing health care programs, scholarship groups, educational tournaments and such groups were starting to find children with sacred gears as well as rare talents as in Hero Descendants.</p><p>Stealing sacred gears from those who have already activated them is slightly risky so this method was used.</p><p>It was basically what the Church did. Only they experimented with the children to make super soldier wannabes.</p><p>We are instead providing them with options as we are taking care of their studies and living arrangements and providing them with job offers. If they accept it, they will be trained in combat or other fields. If they don’t, we will simply trade the Sacred Gears off and continue funding their lives until they are self-sufficient.</p><p>This method has wielded a significant yield already in finding us four high class Sacred Gears already.</p><p>Anyways, Leonardo? The kid with the Annihilation Maker?</p><p><em>“Do you have the contracts I have made for such cases?”</em> I asked, suddenly remembering the contracts.</p><p><em>“The ones for Sacred Gear exchange? Yes, I do. Each of us have a dozen of those at hand? Do you wish for us to extract the Sacred Gear with the contract?”</em> she asked to make sure if I wanted to recruit the child or extract the Sacred Gear.</p><p><em>“What kind of people are his parents?”</em> I asked, thinking about something.</p><p><em>“They are devout church followers. If we don’t complete the extraction soon, I doubt that the child won’t be recruited in the church.”</em> She replied.</p><p>Normally I would have recruited the boy without a single moment of hesitation….but still had his parents?</p><p>Yeah….I’d rather take the Sacred Gear and find another suitable Host for it.</p><p>Lavinia had no one with her and could easily be recruited. If this boy had been an orphan or else shunned by others, I would have recruited him too.</p><p>If I had to train a host from the ground up, I would rather pick up someone with more potential and no other ties to the world.</p><p>I wouldn’t lie that the Binder’s Essence was useful and I would probably be dead without it… but being surrounded by yes men all the time could be incredibly bad. It can make me lose all my inhibitions and that is why I am choosing my targets very carefully. Not to mention the powers I can offer.</p><p>This was one of the reasons I haven’t used the loyalty function on a few people despite them being marked and have only put a confidentiality contract with it and even that was skipped with Vienna.</p><p>Moreover I doubt that the parents of Leonardo would be happy. Imagine the parents of devout church people agreeing for their child who might have a World Destroying Weapon made by God, being sent to the literal child created from the blood of two of the most hated enemies of Christianity.</p><p>I am already thankful that I even had the chance to get Leonardo under Alicia’s search radar for a moment.</p><p><em>“Extract the Sacred Gear. Offer him complete treatment in return and a reasonable amount to provide for his education and welfare.”</em> I commanded as I proceeded to wear my clothing.</p><p><em>“It will be done, Young Lord.”</em> She replied.</p><p>This was a windfall. If I get this one, I would have enough power to hold myself and be independent soon. Not to mention that it will have crippled the Hero Faction before it can even be born. I doubt that without the Dimension Lost, any quick escapes that they made would be possible so their operation would already have been extremely difficult. Now with the Annihilation Maker out, that would be near about impossible.</p><p>While it is true that the ‘True Longinus’ is still the strongest, Cao Cao alone with his bunch of Hero wannabes won’t be much of a problem.</p><p>I would have tried acquiring the True Longinus too if it hadn’t been for ‘The Will of God’ inside it. I have no idea how it would react to me.</p><p>Could I even bind something like that? Theoretically, I would need to be stronger than the Biblical God to bind him….but the question was, was it worth it?</p><p>Which people do not realize something extremely important, I know it for a fact.</p><p>The Biblical God’s disappearance has caused a heavy imbalance in the System. It was especially the disappearance of the Biblical God. This has caused the Sacred Gears to attain Balance Breakers and even evolve. This has caused something like the Holy Demonic element to exist.</p><p>Most of these are the powers that I am using. If suddenly the Biblical God reappeared due to my Binder, and the balance is somehow restored, I will lose much more than I will gain though.</p><p>So binding the True Longinus’ will is out of the question.</p><p>I came out of my room. Today was a day that I was being taken outside and not with the likes of Shalba who had only taken me out to the labs where experiments conducted by his people were present, all the while bragging about it all.</p><p>No finally after a six month period, I was being taken out by Katerea again.</p><p>It is not like I hadn’t tried binding both Shalba and Creuserey too but it is just that both of them had been maintaining a certain distance from me since the Rizevim incident. It was clear for everyone that even Katerea was endangered last time due to ‘Rizevim’s Ploy’ so no one wanted to take the risk.</p><p>That however didn’t mean they stopped contacting me though. It is just that….they were a little more wary of me….well fuck that, they both looked like they were walking on pin-cushions. It was quite suffocating.</p><p>If I had tried something during those times, things would have been bad.</p><p>Simply because the meetings were never in private and there were just too many people around.</p><p>Today’s meeting was for another trade. I had considered meeting Kuroka and Shirone but till now we can only talk through our mental links after a single meeting. I cannot meet them without exposing them to the Old Satan Faction and I know for a fact now that Shalba was experimenting on Youkai subjects.</p><p>Pushing the thoughts out of my mind, I walked out of my room.</p><p>Aria was waiting there with breakfast already. Razevan had left a while ago.</p><p>Vienna was still getting ready in her room.</p><p>I looked at her. A new bruise was on the corner of her lips. I clenched my hands, digging my nails into my palms almost drawing blood from the skin.</p><p>Again, she is putting on that cheerful face. She looks at me and hides all that pain and puts on her smile to cheer me on again.</p><p>I hate it all.</p><p>Fuck!.</p><p>If I can’t even help the woman I like almost as a mother, what good are these powers?</p><p>I gritted my teeth, breaking the unspoken rule between us.</p><p>“He did it again?” I whispered slowly.</p><p>She looked at me for an instant before realizing what I had said as her eyes widened.</p><p>“Why do you bear this?” I spoke as I walked forward holding her hand.</p><p>I can help her in many ways but if she herself doesn’t want it, then I will do nothing. I don’t want to change her mind with magic. No matter how beautiful the cage, it is ultimately a cage. No matter how well a bird is treated, it is still a prisoner. I don’t want her to trade prisons from this place to her own mind and masters from Razevan to me.</p><p>“Y-young Lord.” She was surprised by the question, then proceeded to hug me.</p><p>“It’s because he is my husband. He is under a lot of pressure and sometimes loses his control in anger. It is my duty as a wife to always support my husband, always.”</p><p>Bullshit.</p><p>“Once is understandable….twice can be forgiven somehow. So many times? Do you even remember how many times it has been?” I asked not giving up here.</p><p>“It doesn’….” </p><p>“Eighty three times in the last four years, sixty two in the last one and a half years itself. I know. I have counted it all. At this rate he will kill you sooner or later. So answer me why?”</p><p>She looked into my eyes and answered, “ He will never kill me. It’s because he is my husband.”</p><p>FUCK IT.</p><p>“THEN WHAT ABOUT US? WHAT IS VIENNA? WHAT ABOUT….what about me?” I almost pleaded.</p><p>The last few years had been much more painful because of the torture that Aria has been going through. It had escalated when Vienna’s Sacred Gear was revealed and even further when I had killed those people during the spy incident. I have somehow been able to keep Vienna out of it as much as I could but Aria suffered.</p><p>All I need is that one word.</p><p>Anything.</p><p>Just a single help….a single please.</p><p>She however proceeded to hug me softly, placing my head in her bosom. “Vienna is my sweet daughter….and you are my….” She cupped my face in her hands and looked me directly into my eyes. Her eyes were soft and filled with love and affection. Please say that word, my whole being urged again…. “Cute little,” only to be crushed “….Young Lord.” She smiled.</p><p>The glasses in the room shattered. My heart shattered along with them. I looked back at her and her face was shocked but right now I needed some time for myself.</p><p>I pushed my Occlumency and swallowed the lump in my throat and spoke in my usual stoic voice, “I will eat outside today. Thank you.” and left without turning back.</p><p>Tears threatened to fall but I didn’t turn back and left, hiding everything under my mental shields.</p><p>On the way, I saw Razevan walking back and if my hate could kill, Razevan Lucifer would have been a mangled corpse on the floor right now but I simply walked ahead, not paying any attention to him at all.</p><p><strong>- Scene Change –</strong></p><p>We teleported to the decided place in a flash of our Magic Circle as I scanned the area to check for any spies again.</p><p>“All Clear. No one followed us this time.” I announced as we waited for the other party to arrive there.</p><p>I had more than enough thoughts going inside my head so the time spent was quiet and soon a black car arrived.</p><p>Katerea set a barrier to keep our identities hidden.</p><p>The trade this time was a unique one.</p><p>Soon a young boy of around eighteen years arrived on a bike. I sensed no one else in the area so this was the only person here.</p><p>I used an illusion to change myself to look older. A young child doesn’t look good at negotiations and a young boy like this might not take me seriously after looking at my young form.</p><p>The boy soon came inside the warehouse and looked around to check if anyone else was present.</p><p>I sensed the metal around the area vibrating but didn’t say anything except merely keeping an eye on it. The Sacred Gear responds to the will of the user and this is one of the stronger ones. It is inevitable that something like this would happen. I would doubt the situation if something like this didn’t happen.</p><p>If anything it showed good instincts. He was checking the area for anyone else using the vibrations of the iron in this place.</p><p>I can see myself not regretting this decision now.</p><p>“Are you the one who left the message?” he asked, getting straight to the point.</p><p>“That would depend on what that message would be?” I asked.</p><p>“The offer about the job?” the man</p><p>“Technically I didn’t leave the message but yes, the message was from me.” I smiled trying to lighten the mood. The boy looked at me with suspicion.</p><p>On one hand, meeting someone for the first time in such an abandoned warehouse didn’t do much to invoke feelings of trust on the other hand, I didn’t have any other choice.</p><p>After the last meeting, I didn’t want anyone to get any idea about where and who I was meeting. Any public area would have made it extremely hard to look for spies either so this was the only place I could think of. Considering that I haven’t even met Lavinia yet and I am here to meet this boy personally, it is already evident how important he is for my plans in the near future.</p><p>“I will tell you outright that I have no intention of doing anything if it is illegal. I am preparing to join law enforcement. I just need money to pay my bills right now. So if this is any of the shady business, I am out already.” He spoke upfront.</p><p>Katerea’s emotions flared a little at his straightforward attitude, what with her not being used to such instances of communication and she was about to say something but I raised a hand and stopped her.</p><p>I actually liked his attitude and smiled. It is good to have such open-hearted and honest people around too.</p><p>“I assure you that it is nothing illegal. We will provide you with payments for all your bills and in return you just have to work for me. A bodyguard’s job if you will.” He raised an eyebrow at this and I smiled and explained. “I require a bodyguard against certain….special people.” I replied while an icicle formed above my hand.</p><p>The boy tensed before I dispersed the icicle and looked directly at him.</p><p>“I can’t tell you much about me right now except that I need help from people with special talents. When I start my business, it will ruffle some feathers of extremely influential people and while none of them can do anything to me politically or socially by then, it is a sure shot assumption that I will be targeted. I want to hire you for a protection routine for myself.</p><p>“Why me?” he asked, voice neutral and guard up.</p><p>I smiled, “We know about your special talent. I have no idea if you know what that power actually is but it is something that will be invaluable for my protection. In return, we will provide you with training and resources to develop that power to its fullest extent and reach your full potential in return for your services to me.”</p><p>“Isn’t this just magic?” he asked, bringing his hand up as iron dust in the surrounding swirled into a spike of iron just like my icicle and floated right above his hand.</p><p>“If we go into technicalities, then yes, it is magic <a href=\"https://but….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">but….it</a> is different from what I used. I will explain everything later on.”</p><p>He looked a little pensive but after a moment of thought looked at me and sheepishly rubbed the back of his head, “Umm sure. As long as it’s nothing illegal, I am all for it….although I don’t even know the name of my employer yet.”</p><p>I chuckled at this too. “I will tell you my name after you learn some methods to protect your mind. There is no shortage of people in this world who can read minds at will or simply hypnotize you easily. Protecting your mind is the basics of the. basics.”</p><p>“You’ve got to be shitting me man. Mind Readers are real? That is so scary. Imagine some creep looking into my mind directly. They have got to be rare right?” he asked, suddenly looking pale.</p><p>I laughed again, “I can estimate over a few million beings who can do so easily.” I mean almost all devils can use some form of mind magic however weak against normal people. The same is the case with normal supernatural beings. “To keep the existence of the Supernatural world a secret, it is one of the first things taught to anyone before being allowed in the open in the human world.”</p><p>“Shit! So people can get the password for my computer directly from my head?” he asked looking horrified.</p><p>I burst out into a laugh, “And even know the location of your hidden stash in your hard disk drive. It is very easy.”</p><p>“I’m in bro. You give me your training and I will protect you as you have asked. No illegal stuff though. I am not into criminal stuff.”</p><p>Well….that went off easier than I had thought.</p><p>Perhaps his simple nature along with my use of Bewitching Voice and inhuman Charisma from my King’s Essence worked to make this easier.</p><p>I brought out a contract with the details already written in it. “This is a contract between you and me. Make sure to read it properly.”</p><p>The thing with contracts with normal people is that – they don’t take it seriously.</p><p>The saying – ‘Read a contract properly before signing,’ is true no matter the world.</p><p>“The contract is cool. I would like to clarify that I have a girlfriend whom I do not intend to leave.” He spoke a little hesitantly.</p><p>The offer was too good to give up anyway so it was understandable why he was hesitating.</p><p>“That’s fine. If you want we can arrange teaching sessions as a scholarship program or even in this area. You can meet your girlfriend whenever you want. Just be reminded of the confidentiality contract. You cannot disclose any information about the general existence of magic without our permission.” I looked a little conflicted and I was more calmed by it than anything. It showed his inherent loyalty which I want to be directed towards me. “Don’t worry though. If you two are married, we can even extend teaching Magic to your wife….that is if you continue the service properly.”</p><p>And thus the bait was hung in the front. He steeled himself and signed the contract and handed it back to me. I looked it over and felt the contract solidify and smiled.</p><p>“It is nice doing business with you Mr. Magnus Rose. I know that we will get along well.” We shook our hands and smiled at each other.</p><p>We stayed till Magnus left and were about to visit Lavinia to check her progress when I heard a voice.</p><p><em>“Dummy….please come back. Dummy please. Mama….she’s….she is not talking. She is not waking up. Dummy come back. Please Dummy.”</em> Vi’s voice rang through our mental link and as my brain comprehended the words, my blood chilled instantly.</p><p>_____________________________x___________________________________________________________x______________________________</p><p><strong>Beta Reader: LuluViBritania(FF.N, SB and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th BritannianEmperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note :</strong></p><p><strong>This chapter is slightly shorter than the normal ones. There are many reasons behind it.</strong></p><p><strong>First being, this was supposed to be the second part of the previous chapter. I had to make two chapters because the last one extended a bit more.</strong></p><p><strong>Second, things will start picking up pace in a chapter or two probably so I couldn’t write the next scene here. It will be in the next chapter.</strong></p><p><strong>Anyways, I got some complaints - first, there has been a lack of character development in the previous two chapters.</strong></p><p><strong>I will like to continue the story at my own pace. 44.5k words are not enough for me to show a completely new scenario and also develop all the characters including the OCs I have added.</strong></p><p><strong>It will take time. There is absolutely no reason to just develop a character the instant after they are introduced. If you are expecting a story where all characters are well knitted and developed from the start, maybe try other things. I am planning to take it slow.</strong></p><p><strong>Also, I remember reading that Kuroka and Shirone’s scene should have been described better. I will describe their bonding later on when Damien will be free to meet them. As it stands now, he has barely met them once in months and I can’t see a reasonable bond development in such a short period of time.</strong></p><p><strong>Damien is under heavy surveillance right now and can’t meet his subordinates freely. His movements with Katerea are being reduced and Diehauser was also added into the equation.</strong></p><p><strong>If anything he cannot afford to make any overt movements right now.</strong></p><p><strong>Second, the situation with Damien’s indecisiveness with Aria.</strong></p><p><strong>I would rather call it his sanity.</strong></p><p><strong>We don’t just Bind a person to keep them alive even against their own will and claim that it is because of love or what’s good for them or whatever shit.</strong></p><p><strong>Aria loves Razevan due to whatever reason it is and it is her choice on how she wants to live.</strong></p><p><strong>Damien is simply mature enough to understand her choices, even if he doesn’t like it.</strong></p><p><strong>The outburst was due to Aria’s stubbornness and Damien’s puberty. Damn hormones.</strong></p><p><strong>As for the plot, even if some things don’t make sense now, it will start making sense in a few chapters. Just hang on there.</strong></p><p><strong>I tried to show some point of view from Albion’s side here. For so much of the plot based on the Heavenly Dragons, we barely know anything about them at all. A slight glimpse of Albion’s thoughts regarding God were shown here.</strong></p><p><strong>We got another member for the team.</strong></p><p><strong>We might get a few developments regarding the lore like this.</strong></p><p><strong>Anyways stay hanging from the cliff….till next time.</strong></p><p><strong>Enjoy the chapter for now.</strong></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br></p><p> </p><p> </p><p><br></p>",

    "title": "The Deal: Chapter 5 : First Blood",
    "content": "<p><strong>Disclaimer : I own nothing.</strong></p><p><strong>Chapter 5 : First Blood.</strong></p><p><strong>- Damien –</strong></p><p>A year has passed since I celebrated my eleventh birthday a week ago and a lot has happened in this year.</p><p>I only have one Binder slot open right now and even that was only acquired a day ago.</p><p>The last year has been extremely eventful considering how much progress I have made in my goals, both in personal development as well as making a network.</p><p>Ophelia won me the lottery with the five girls in the party.</p><p>Each of the girls are a gem in their own right, whether it is with their connections or their own personal talents.</p><p>Helena Dantalion.</p><p>Dantalion was known as The Keeper of the Forbidden Library of Bibliotheca. A devil related to knowledge and that was for a certain reason.</p><p>The Dantalions held almost all the knowledge of hell except the most private secrets of a House. No one could claim to hand over that knowledge either.</p><p>It was bound by blood. The Head of the House can remove anyone of the blood from the list of the people allowed into their Library with a mere thought. They also removed any daughter or son married off to another family from this list so that others don’t get access to their knowledge.</p><p>Now most would wonder why they don’t just destroy the castle Dantalion and siege the library.</p><p>Well, it turns out that The Forbidden Library of Bibliotheca was an entirely separate dimension. The Dantalion House’s Trait was an affinity for spatial magic. Their children could get into the dimension only when the path is shown by someone in their house and this secret is guarded with zeal.</p><p>To keep the knowledge close to their hearts is a saying that they have taken up to the T and this was proven to be a wise decision.</p><p>The Dantalions were one of the least affected Houses in both of the wars. In the Great War, they were kept back to provide help in logistics while in the Civil War, none of the sides dared to lay a finger on them fearing that they would side with the other side. This helped them remain neutral for a long time.</p><p>They did side with the current government but that was because the Civil War was leading the Devil Population to their end. Ultimately the Dantalions were a House that wanted the development of the Devil Race as a whole. A rarity that I have come to respect.</p><p>Helena Dantalion was a beautiful lady who looks to be in her early twenties with deep navy blue hair and similar coloured eyes and had the look of a refined lady of the nobility. She had a very calm and composed demeanor and high intellect which along with her access to the Forbidden Library made her one of the top most scholars in the world.</p><p>This has helped me immensely in my research with my Illusion Technique. I can now put Katerea under an Illusion within 12 seconds and that is when she has regularly been used as a practice dummy for me and has developed some semblance of resistance to normal illusions.</p><p>My masterpiece is different though. The longer someone is under its effect, the easier they will fall under it the next time because their energy gets used to the new pattern of flow and changing it becomes very difficult. A conditioned reflex of the body. So even if I remove someone from under the effect of the Illusion, the next time I can catch them much easier and faster too.</p><p>Helena’s teachings on even normal elemental magic and their effects on the world as a whole was fascinating and although some of her theories are still ….well theories as they need enormous levels of powers and extreme Mastery to achieve, my powers and Essence of the Blank makes it easier for me.</p><p>She has made it a point to teach me about spatial magic even the special cases from the Dantalion House considering they have an affinity for space magic. This in turn enabled me to help teach Gretel the same and she could use it too considering that her father was a branch house member of the Dantalions. She had inherited her father’s Trait instead of her mother’s which was the reason why she had lesser Affinity in Ice Magic compared to a normal Lucifuge. That said there was a reason why Dantalion was called the Duke of the Devils.</p><p>Spatial Magic is pretty fucking insane if used properly.</p><p>I am actually stunned to see that it is a pretty underused class of magic except for out of battle teleportation and making pocket dimensions.</p><p>I estimate that if Gretel can reach her full potential with this type of magic then by her twenties, she will become a pseudo-Super Devil, something beyond a normal Satan Class but not yet a Super Devil Class. Although, I have prepared a last push for this as well.”</p><p><strong>- Flashback (Ten Months Ago) –</strong></p><p>It happened two months after the party Ophelia had organized.</p><p>I was informed by Katerea that the meeting she had been trying to set had finally been decided. One of my targets was ready to meet me. The meeting was scheduled like the previous one but this one instead at a different site.</p><p>We had to improvise because ever since the last meeting, I sensed that I was being followed. I informed Katerea about it and it took me a few minutes to realize who they were when I described their appearances to her.</p><p>They were the lackeys of Euclid or rather the lackeys of Rizevim who controlled them through Euclid. Rizevim would never let any of these incompetent idiots anywhere near him.</p><p>Euclid was turning into a bigger pain in the neck with each passing day. He was going to die, that was for sure. I just won’t be able to live with myself if I left him alive after all the suffering he had caused Gretel. I was even planning to bind him if possible to make any use of him till it was convenient for me. That bastard Euclid had continuously kept a constant distance from me. The previous measurements of my power reserves were now done by random people that were sent to check up on my health regularly and monitor my progress.</p><p>Still this was the limit. Sending people to spy on me.</p><p>I think that the last meeting might have been tracked somehow. It is not that we had lied and disappeared somewhere though.</p><p>It was a minor inconvenience though. I left a clone with Katerea while she invoked a barrier in the place. The aim of this action was to simply cover my demonic power which I used to put an illusion around myself and then jump behind them with a short range teleportation. The Illusion was to make me look like ….Rizevim and the barrier covered my clone and Katerea temporarily during the invocation for me to slip.</p><p>I slowly put the two of them in an illusion. The same one that I use on Katerea however this one will simply make them fail to notice me. I then scanned their bodies to check for any surveillance devices or spells. Finding nothing, I heaved a sigh of relief. If I had found something, I would have had to bind both of them till they could be disposed of without any suspicions towards me.</p><p>With a second illusion prepared to subdue them if necessary, I took a deep breath and prepared for the next part.</p><p>Time to play this out.</p><p>“How is the work progressing?” I tried to imitate Rizevim’s look to the best of my ability. The ‘Bewitching Voice’ making it impossible for them to ignore me or notice anything awry.</p><p>The two for their part jumped back to a defensive position as quickly as possible, each ready to attack at the moment’s notice.</p><p>“Keep your Demonic Powers under control. If they notice your presence, no matter the Demonic power you use will change your fates.” I spoke casually all the while my eyes remained on my clone and Katerea.</p><p>“L-lord Rizevim.” Stuttered the shorter one.</p><p>“How long have they been here?” I asked, remaining unphased.</p><p>The stooges collected themselves quite fast however. Perhaps they were not that incompetent after all. “About ten minutes ago My Lord.”</p><p>“Have they met anyone in this time?”</p><p>“No My Lord.”</p><p>I stayed silent for a few moments while looking at my clone and then turned towards the stooges, eyes bringing about all the seriousness I could, “I take it that you both are aware of the seriousness of the mission.”</p><p>“Y-yes my Lord. We are to assess the motives of Lady Leviathan regarding the young Lord and find out what they are doing.”</p><p>I nodded. “I hope you understand what would happen if you were to be discovered?” I however gave them no chance to reply and sighed. “To think that Katerea wouldn’t even realize that she was being followed in all this time, just what have the descendants of the proud Leviathan come to?” I then looked at the two of them. My Observation Haki sensed their overflowing fear which had fluctuated with a tinge of disdain when I bad mouthed Katerea and went back to fear when I again looked back at them. “Or perhaps the two of you are much more competent than your age seems.” Their emotions jumped to one of pride for an instant.</p><p>I then pretended to ponder for a moment and then looked at the two of them again, “Say…would the two of you like to work for me directly?” I found that the shorter one was happy while the taller one didn’t show it directly. He was a little suspicious at the sudden offer. Nope that wouldn’t do. I expanded my demonic power slowly to just expand the two of them. The Illusion helping me to disguise my presence and making it seem to them as if it was Rizevim’s power instead of my own. “Or is that a No!?.” I glared at the taller one who went completely white in the face. His suspicion completely drowned under the overwhelming fear.</p><p>“N-no my Lord. I-I accept.” He stuttered while the other one nodded frantically.</p><p>“Then pledge your loyalty to me and in return I will let you live for this slight.” I smiled just slightly, “Is that a Deal?”</p><p>“Y-yes My Lord, I Sectus Amon, swear my eternal and undying loyalty to you in body, mind, heart and soul.” The taller one breathed heavily as the pressure kept increasing on them.</p><p>The other one, Aractus Shax soon followed and my smile widened.</p><p>Deal complete.</p><p>I looked at my two new thugs with a smile on my face. The idiots had sworn off their minds, hearts and souls as well. That made any conscious betrayals impossible.</p><p>The illusion dispersed and I again returned back to my true form. The two in front of me however didn’t have any reaction to it. They were already completely loyal to me.</p><p>The Essence of the Broker is….broken as fuck.</p><p>“Who sent you and why?”</p><p>“Euclid Lucifuge to monitor you and find out if Katerea Leviathan was influencing you in any way.”</p><p>“What would you do then?”</p><p>“We were to be called in front of Rizevim Livan Lucifer by Euclid and report that Katerea Leviathan was meeting with the members of the new Satans and bringing you to them to plan a coup in return for the Leviathan title.”</p><p>….that….what the fuck?</p><p>“Who else is in on his plan?” I asked as hundreds of thoughts raced through my mind.</p><p>“When we were ordered, only he was present, my Lord.”</p><p>“What do you mean ‘when you were ordered’? Give me all the information you have.” I asked impatiently.</p><p>“I have heard that Creuserey Asmodeus was also in on this plan. They were a bit wary of how close you were with Katerea Leviathan and wanted to spread suspicions about you.”</p><p>“That does sound like something that Creuserey would do, Young Lord. As for Euclid, I can hazard a guess as well,” Katerea’s voice brought my attention to her, “but I assume that you already know the reason.”</p><p>“Gretel.” I whispered softly.</p><p>“To be honest Young Lord, you have been keeping her around yourself almost constantly,” she said a little hesitatingly.</p><p>It is because Gretel has been forcing herself to overcome her fears. I don’t want her to snap and break due to stress. She is making a lot of progress but the amount of stress that she is under is not something someone barely into their teenage years should have to bear though.</p><p>“And that has led to me being targeted by that piece of shit or rather you being targeted with me being discredited.” I clenched my fists.</p><p>That said, what should I do now?</p><p>If they return, they will be expected to relay the false report which would get me restricted, if they don’t, they will be marked as traitors and be killed. Not that I care about them but then why? Why do I have a bad feeling about all this? ….just what should I do?</p><p>“I can just kill them. I will say that I caught them following me and thought that they looked suspicious. Not that someone like Euclid can call me out or anything and Creuserey knows better than to say anything to me directly. He can only try to make moves in the background.” Katerea offered.</p><p>I would consider it too but something….something didn’t sit right here.</p><p>How could Euclid just make a plan like this? I know that the man is borderline crazy for Grayfia and now some of it is being transferred over to Gretel but….is it still crazy enough to actually come for me directly?</p><p>And not just me but even <a href=\"https://Katerea….no\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Katerea….no</a> matter how I think, something is wrong here. After all….this plan didn’t do anything but aggravate me and Katerea and at the very worst, it would make some people suspicious about Katerea. Not like anyone would dare to question the Leviathan about it.</p><p>Should I let this be as it is? Even if we get caught there is nothing that can be done to us and it would show that we were of no danger to Euclid if we could be targeted so easily.</p><p>But the actual question was….would it stop at that? Would Euclid try something else and if that could lead to more scrutiny on me. Even if we are not called out on it, they would still try to keep a closer eye on us.</p><p>I need more information.</p><p>“What would you have done if the two of you were caught spying on us?” I asked the two.</p><p>“We were told that we were to say that we came to keep guard on you two to keep you safe My Lord.” answered Aractus. “And that we were told to stay hidden so as to not hinder your training.” completed the second one.</p><p>“Do you know for sure that it was Creuserey Asmodeus who was with Euclid in this plan?”</p><p>The two looked at each other for a while and then answered, “We have heard this through rumors.”</p><p>So not sure shot information here.</p><p>One last doubt I needed to clear, “Are any of your Houses involved with this?”</p><p>Aractus nodded while the other denied. Sectus continued, “My House is close to the Astaroth House and supports Ajuka Beelzebub. I joined the Old Satan Faction because I am from a Branch House and was promised the Head of the House position when we take control over the underworld’s devils.</p><p>So the Shax were sided with whoever was making this plan.</p><p>I closed my eyes and reviewed all the facts that I had on my mind and ran through every possible situation that I could and thought of a plan to utilize this situation in the best possible way.</p><p>I brought out two pieces of parchment and made two contracts and then passed it off to the two of them to sign. “Read this and if you agree, sign it.”</p><p>The two read the contract and signed it without any hesitation. The Essence of the Broker for the win any day.</p><p>I looked at Katerea and then back to the meeting place, “Call Shalba and ask him to verify that these two were sent by Euclid. If asked why, say that Euclid himself wasn’t reachable. If I remember correctly, his lab has measures against communications. Record the conversation and when it is done, return. We will continue with the meeting.”</p><p>And so we did. We waited for the other party to arrive and he did twenty minutes later. A boy who was barely 10 years old arrived with another Human magician and another Devil who I didn’t have any idea about.</p><p>I looked at the boy who had black hair and was wearing glasses but those eyes hid ambition in them. I could sense his trepidation but he still held up despite this. This is the person I was looking for.</p><p>Georg Faust. The descendant of Faust, the Magician who had made a contract with Mephisto Pheles but more importantly for me….the wielder of the Longinus Dimension Lost.</p><p>The other two left the boy with us as they left. They were both Alicia’s people and she had already made them sign the required contracts that would wipe their memories about anything to do with this deal as soon as they returned back home and forbid them to ever talk about it before then.</p><p>I had taken precautions for every step that I could think of.</p><p>Katerea took the initiative to talk while I merely watched. She had to assert that she was the one teaching here. “So you are the child who wanted to make a contract with us?” she asked imperiously to the little boy who looked a little nervous but nodded quickly.</p><p>“Why do you want to make a contract with me? You could have chosen anyone else, even your ancestor’s benefactor, Mephisto Pheles?” she continued.</p><p>“T-they are not as strong as you. The Old Satans made the Devils and many magics to increase powers much faster than what the new ones do. I want that power.”</p><p>“Proposing a deal are we?” she smiled and then looked towards me, “In that case Damien, you will take care of this deal.”</p><p>I nodded in return. “So you want the magic of the Old Satans to increase your magic powers quickly?” I asked slowly.</p><p>“Yes. Any ritual or similar magic.” He clarified.</p><p>There are several such magical rituals that I have read upon. It was also when I discovered there was a reason the Old Satans were hated so much. Sacrificial Rituals containing simple sacrifices from an animal to the blood of a virgin to even a newborn child. The horrors and sheer extent of human depravity that was written in those books almost made me puke if not for my Occlumency.</p><p>Those rituals were strictly banned right now and any devils found teaching them to humans are penalized heavily, although it is mostly reincarnated devils but this is a law that is followed quite strictly even for the pure blood devils. After all, the world already had more than enough with the Evil Piece System. If they added the rituals and soul based contracts again, it would surely lead to the other factions to target them aggressively.</p><p>Thus, the only place to acquire such rituals was….from the creators of the said rituals directly.</p><p>“I assume that you will arrange for the materials for the rituals on your own?” I asked.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>“Very well. I can provide such rituals.”</p><p>I felt his emotions bubble up in excitement when it suddenly calmed down a little and he reigned his expressions in quickly, although his true feelings were easy for me to see. “W-what do you want in return?” he asked slightly hesitantly.</p><p>“I want….ehh an artifact or item of my choice. Your ancestor is said to have many trinkets. I want an artifact of my choice from you.” He raised an eyebrow but I changed the subject and directed him towards his desired rituals. Katerea had brought out the piece of paper and I brought out the contract. “But before that you should check the contract and see if it is acceptable.” And pushed the books about rituals towards the other end of the table.</p><p>He quickly looked through the book and then back at me. After a few looks, he nodded and I passed the contract and he raised an eyebrow. “What is this?”</p><p>“A contract. It states that you will offer me an item or artifact of my choosing from you and that you cannot tell anyone about what happened in this deal. We don’t want anyone to just search your mind and find out about it so after the deal is complete, you will forget everything about this meeting. If you don’t remember, no one can find the information out of you so this is to protect both of us,” he seemed a little reluctant at the memories part but I pushed on slightly. “After all, we wouldn't want any of the new Satan’s people to find out about this deal, now do we?” I used my trump card. Fear.</p><p>And the result was expected. Trepidation flooded his emotions and he looked pale at the thought and then I took the opportunity to pull in a little. “If you don’t have the memories, you can pretend that you were kidnapped and experimented on or even that someone is trying to frame you….however if you are caught with the memories….well I….” I let my words drift and watched the pale face of the boy all the while enjoying myself.</p><p>As expected this was too much for the inexperienced little kid and he folded in quite fast.</p><p>“I-I agree.” He took the pen that I offered to him and signed the contract and I smiled inwardly. I had sensed the presence of his Sacred Gear already.</p><p>The deal was completed.</p><p>I got up from my seat and shook hands with the boy. “It was nice doing business with you. I hope that we can make more deals in the future. I will await it.”</p><p>“Y-yes. Thank you very much.” He hugged the book close to his chest and turned around walking out of the house.</p><p>Sensing that he was out of the range, I scanned the area for any spells, and upon finding nothing, I looked at Katerea and ordered, “Ask the person who will deliver him back to take away the book from him when he falls asleep. His memories of anything even remotely related to the deal will be removed in an hour.”</p><p>She nodded and walked out. What? I had promised to offer the Ritual Books but nothing about not stealing them back.</p><p>With all this taken care of, I waited for Katerea to complete her work. She returned very soon.</p><p>Now onto the harder part.</p><p>I looked towards Sectus Amon and said, “I am sorry but for this plan to work, you will have to perish.”</p><p>The power of the Essences showed when the man simply bowed and accepted it without a work.</p><p>I continued, “To make it seem real, attack me, but first attack Aractus. Just injure his arm with your House Trait.”</p><p>He looked conflicted for a moment after which he steeled himself and brought out his demonic energy to attack me. The Poisonous Flames, a special trait of the House of Amon, flared and first burned Aractus’ hand but before any flames could come out towards me, he was frozen into an icicle.</p><p>Well….what can I say? I have mastered the elemental magic to borderline Satan Class already.</p><p>“Young Lord?” Katerea was about to ask but hesitated. This was actually the first time I have killed something and despite being a devil, the remaining human parts of me from my previous life still wanted to vomit seeing the frozen countenance of the Amon Devil.</p><p>I pushed the memories out with my Occlumency. I still have work to do now. Time cannot be wasted as every instant counts.</p><p>“Katerea, put a barrier around us. Make it a strong one.” I instructed.</p><p>She complied with it as soon as she regained her bearing and made a strong water based Barrier, a specialty of the Leviathan House.</p><p>I brought out a hand from inside the Barrier and used something that I hadn’t had a chance to use at all. Something that I didn’t even dare to train inside the Old Satan Factions hideout either.</p><p>The Reactor inside me worked full time as a ball of energy manifested in the space in front of us just outside the barrier.</p><p>“T-that….” Katerea stuttered. I however paid her no mind as I concentrated on the ball of energy. I had only seen this in videos and this was the first time I was even attempting to use it. Not that I didn’t know the theory behind it.</p><p>It expanded quickly in size and soon there was a twenty meters big ball of….light in front of us. “Hold the barriers tight.” I commanded and this time Aractus joined in on it too and slowly I exerted my control over the light. The ball was shaped into numerous spears of light and then with a simple wave of my hand, it rained.</p><p>Any Fallen or Angel would have laughed at the inefficient use of the light energy. This took a lot out of me but still….when considered that this was done by a Devil, the situation became just that much more incredulous.</p><p>The entire area was riddled with holes and explosions and while the other two were looking at the carnage, I kicked Aractus out.</p><p>Before he could even say anything, his body was pierced with several spears and was riddled with wounds all over.</p><p>Aractus Shax died.</p><p>Did I feel bad about killing them?</p><p>Yes….the human part of me was disgusted.</p><p>Did I feel regretful?</p><p>No….if things had been different, these idiots would have accused Katerea and me of being traitors and while that wouldn’t have been completely <a href=\"https://incorrect….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">incorrect….it</a> was still them who made the first move.</p><p>“Young Lord!”</p><p>I dragged the pin-cushioned body of Aractus inside and ordered, “Blast the area with a high powered Demonic Powered attack to mix with the light magic. You discovered the two and they informed you that they were sent by Euclid. You verified this information. Sectus Amon however was plotting with the new Satans and had leaked the information about our meeting point to stray Fallen. We were ambushed and Sectus attacked Aractus and burned his arm but was killed before he could do anything to me. You then killed the rest of the Fallen with a high powered attack. You are to make sure that everyone! hears this as you then put the entire blame of this whole incident on Euclid for his incompetence that had caused the two of us and especially me to die. Then call out that he might be following Grayfia’s footsteps and take this opportunity to bring Gretel under our supervision.” My eyes grew colder with each world I spoke…. “If they are playing the blame game, then they should be prepared for it to. Make sure that you are as angry as you can be and create a scene that the entire faction watches.”</p><p>I was barely holding back with Gretel suffering due to her request to not interfere and let her handle it and because I was going to bring us out of that hellhole sooner or later….but if he is targeting me directly….well all bets are off.</p><p>I looked towards the three pieces of parchments from the contracts made today.</p><p>The contracts had taken hold.</p><p>Georg Faust already had his sacred gear removed on my command and memories about it forgotten.</p><p>As for the contracts signed by the other two….they were made so that anyone who signs the contract apart from them, will gain all of their powers, even the clan traits in their entirety after their deaths. If they die before anyone could sign the contract, their powers will be stored in the contract itself.</p><p>The Broker Essence’s powers depended on the words used to make the contract. The two were High Class Devils and while their powers were not much of a deal to <a href=\"https://me….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">me….it</a> can still make someone like say….Vienna, more than double in power.</p><p>The Clan Traits were always a benefit too.</p><p>I wanted to add memories to this list too but Devils had hundreds of years of memories and people would die if bombarded with that much memory in an instant.</p><p>A two edged sword which can harm both sides. The worst part about the Broker Essence was that even I had to follow the conditions and I cannot put a mind control on someone or lie to someone about the conditions when I make them sign it. This also prevents me from making those I bind using The Binder’s Essence to sign the contracts because they are in essence, being mind controlled. The Broker Essence however was different. Those two had literally sworn off their entire beings to me.</p><p>That was their reality.</p><p>There was no ‘active’ mind control involved.</p><p>Yes….the word active is the key here.</p><p>I could easily condition someone to make the deals without conditions.</p><p>I could even beat someone to submission and make them sign the deal. Blackmail was a fair deal too. The Essence was pretty fine with that because in all those <a href=\"https://cases….in\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">cases….in</a> a twisted kind of a way, the decision was still theirs. It was not like people didn’t break down under torture. If they did, then it is their fault though.</p><p>We returned back to the Old Satan Faction’s Headquarters and Katerea showed me that despite her imperious ways, she was still very similar to a normal woman.</p><p>And boy did she throw a tantrum to cause a scene.</p><p>Euclid never knew what hit him until it was too late.</p><p><strong>- Scene Change -</strong></p><p>Katerea walked into the base with her Demonic power flaring all over the place in an unrestrained fury.</p><p>Any no named mook who even sensed her approaching in the direction hurried away.</p><p>I merely followed her at a slight distance making sure I am not too far behind her.</p><p>Upon reaching the door to the place where Euclid normally sat, there was no waiting l, knocking or anything, a jet of highly compressed water cut through the door as she stepped into the place.</p><p>“What is the meaning of this Lady Leviathan!?” The pond scum shouted but Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned….(I did scorn her quite a bit in my free time) and now poor little Euclid was going to face all that wrath.</p><p>“No, you will tell me what you meant by sending spies after me!?” Katerea didn’t back down either.</p><p>The attention that the place was getting by now was considerable. I mean you didn’t walk with Satan Class powers flaring in the place full of Ultimate Class and Satan Class Devils and not expect no one to check.</p><p>Euclid frowned but replied frostily, “It was to protect the Young Lord. I thought you had already confirmed it.”</p><p>“That I did but none of the reports ever said that one of them was sent to assassinate Damien and me!. He was colluding with the Fallen to ambush us!.” And she dropped the bomb stunning Euclid completely.</p><p>“What?” he whispered.</p><p>“Sectus Amon was a spy!. If you hire someone to a job as important as guarding Damien, at least make sure that you check their backgrounds!. The Amons have been the greatest allies of the Fake Beelzebub’s family. He might have been colluding with them. We were trying to keep the Young Lord’s existence a secret until he was strong enough but You!… You had to go and assign a traitor of all people to guard Damien!. Are you out of your damned mind!?”</p><p>The bastard still looked shocked, “What?”</p><p>I decided to intervene. A few words from the ‘innocent’ me would give weight to Katerea’s statements.</p><p>“Sectus Amon attacked us at the same time the Fallen’s ambush started. His Poisonous Flames burned Aractus’ arm and was heading towards me before I had to kill him. Aractus however didn’t survive as he was caught off guard and was struck with light spears all over his body.” I brought out the bodies of the two from my pocket dimension.</p><p>The still frozen body of Sectus and the pin-cushioned body of Aractus with a burned and rotting arm.</p><p>“Nooo my son!.” another voice joined.</p><p>It was Lord Shax I think. I could care less however. This bastard was in on it too.</p><p>I continued, “Lady Leviathan’s barrier saved us but Aractus had been disoriented from being burned and had fallen into the shower of light spears.” I pointed out the wounds. No one can claim anything otherwise because both the Poisonous Flames and the Light magic had a unique aura to it.</p><p>I turned towards the now grieving Lord Shax and apologized for not being able to save his son.</p><p>….appearances are always helpful.</p><p>Shalba and Creuserey had arrived at the place too.</p><p>I immediately used my Observation Haki on the two and saw that the two were also just that surprised at the scene. I decided to observe the scene from the side.</p><p>“Katerea, what is going on here?” Shalba tried to mediate.</p><p>“Why don’t you ask that to the person who assigned a traitor to guard Damien and me. We barely survived death just now.” She growled, making the man recoil in fear. She then turned towards Euclid and continued, “Tell me, has that been your plan from the beginning? Assassinate me? Betray us?....Just like your sister.” Euclid’s power flared and I could see him clenching his hands tight. “After that the bitch even had the gall to fight for the title of Leviathan against the Fake. Tell me something Euclid, are you colluding with the Fake’s Whore, that sister of yours?”</p><p>“Katerea!.” He barked as a silver magic circle started to light up….but it was instantly dispersed by the sound of a clap.</p><p>Enough power to suffocate everyone present was released and I found myself hard to stay on my feet.</p><p>“Now….we don’t need another Civil War among ourselves do we? We have more than enough people for that already, so calm down.” No one needed to turn back to know who was talking but they did still.</p><p>Rizevim Livian Lucifer walked down with his sarcastic self and that condescending gaze on everyone.</p><p>“Calm down Katerea. This incident, I am afraid, was my own doing.” And even Katerea jerked at that. “You see, I was curious. Curious as to how Damien’s studies were progressing.” He put his hand on my head and caressed my hair while I pushed my Occlumency to my limits to not give away any expression that might suggest anything to bring his suspicion towards me. “Damien has been progressing very quickly in his magic studies but….a real life experience was necessary.” He bowed towards me looking me directly in my eye and continued, “Devils are cruel beings, beings to evil. They do many unspeakable things Damien because….that is what they are. To survive and stand at the top of such beings, you have to become crueler than them all. An assassin to kill you was a test of your resolve. To see if you could handle yourself in a fight or would you stutter and hesitate. If you failed….very sad but hesitation is not worthy of the Lucifer name. Katerea was chosen because she is extremely experienced and would help you survive and also because you trust her as a teacher.” and he then turned towards the frozen statue, “and I see that you have done a very fine job at it, killed in a single attack. No hesitation was shown…. extremely worthy of the Lucifer name.”</p><p>Somehow every word he spoke made my skin crawl with disgust but the Occlumency was helping me keep my calm and maintain a neutral expression.</p><p>Unminding of my reaction, he turned towards Katerea, “Well, Katerea….how did you like my prank.” He smiled jokingly but no one here wanted to refute. Survival instincts sharpened through centuries of experience wasn’t needed to know what would happen if anyone dared to refute. “Ahh, I see that you are upset….so why don’t you take some rest for now. Relax and chill out. See even little Damien here deserves some reward for such a spectacular performance. Euclid, send your little sister along with them. She is Damien’s playmate right?. Uyahahahaha….has Damien decided to choose her as his aide?” He looked at me and laughed. “Oya Oya….has that really been the case, and here I was just joking. Sure sure. As a reward for the first blood, Damien Lucifer now has an aide of his own in Gretel Lucifuge. Clap everyone.” He looked around to see the stunned faces of the people, “What’s this….little Damien just got his aide and no one is happy. Ahh, don’t worry Damien, I will clap for you even if they don’t.” and clap he did.</p><p>The others regained their bearings soon enough and started clapping together.</p><p>Even the Shax had joined in though one only needed to see their faces to know their true feelings.</p><p>It was at that instant that I realized just what kind of a being Rizevim Livian Lucifer was – He was a cruel and remorseless bastard with not a shred of positive feeling who relishes in the pain of others.</p><p>This man was a master of psychological torture and manipulation, knowing just what string to pull and what button to press to get a certain reaction from anyone.</p><p>Devils bear dissension.</p><p>Rizevim Livian Lucifer was a living, breathing example of this.</p><p>I could feel the palpable rage of Euclid as he looked at me maintaining a neutral face.</p><p>The anger and the utter humiliation that Lord Shax hid inside himself as he clapped along. This plan was supposed to change their stance from Rizevim’s side to mine after losing their child. Now I doubt that it will ever happen.</p><p>The moment that I had thought to turn the suspicions of Euclid and his side to get some scrutiny from me was completely overturned with a few words. A certain win to my side was changed to a begrudging draw which has gained me enemies instead.</p><p>Shalba and Creuserey looked almost lost solidifying my previous feeling that the Asmodeus was not involved in this.</p><p>I stood there among the claps of the devils in presence of two dead bodies and a family of grieving relatives thinking about the repercussions of this incident.</p><p><strong>- End of the Flashback –</strong></p><p>That was the first true encounter between me and Rizevim Livan Lucifer ever.</p><p>That was over ten months ago and while I did get Gretel out and officially as my aide, things had somehow become even more tense as if it was even possible.</p><p>I had gained a top tier Longinus, one of the four World Ending ones, The Fog of Extinction, the Dimension Lost as a result of all that.</p><p>Dimension Lost was so important because it solved so many of my problems after we left. Making an isolated dimension to stay, run away from any battle and hide, a threat to keep dangerous people away….but the most important one is that it will be the last push to help Gretel enter the levels of a Super Devil.</p><p>The strongest space type sacred gear with a pseudo-Super Devil specializing in space magic and add on to that the Dantalion’s space affinity.</p><p>Being a one trick pony can be dangerous but Gretel was bordering on Ultimate Class in other magic as well. That said, if one skill is practiced beyond the limits that were initially perceived by people, one can become something beyond the comprehension of people and enter the realm of monsters….become a Super Devil.</p><p>Sirzechs Lucifer is one such monster too.</p><p>The fact that despite the existence of Ajuka and Rizevim, he is still called the Strongest Devil in existence alone is a proof of this fact.</p><p>I want my Gretel to be someone of that level.</p><p>That said not everything was sunshine and butterflies since the incident.</p><p>Ophelia was ordered to keep me away from Katerea more often now to increase the brainwashing. Fortunately Gretel accompanied me for this as well.</p><p>I was now being slowly distanced from Katerea and while we still met quite often, it was significantly lesser than previously.</p><p>During my visits to Ophelia, I even got a chance to meet the two Nekoshou sisters.</p><p>Kuroka and Shirone had been saved by Ophelia. The scumbag of a scientist who was their father had an unfortunate accident. I found out that their mother had passed away while she worked in the branch house of Naberius. The two were barely scraping by each day and so when Ophelia had offered them a job, the elder of the two had jumped at the chance to take it.</p><p>Kuroka was much different from what I had read in the light novels or seen in the anime. She was still just as loving towards her little sister but much more cheerful.</p><p>She reminded me of Vi with how cheeky she was at times. Although there was a hint of maturity in her eyes due to her taking care of herself and her little sister. The weight of responsibility made her mature quicker. Ophelia was personally teaching them both with assistance from Victoria. I had specially asked her to not recruit any of them into peerages. While becoming a devil would no doubt boost their powers, it will also bind them to the current government.</p><p>As long as they are not devils, they are outside the jurisdiction of the current government and can be free whenever they want.</p><p>As for powering them up….I was looking into something of my own for that.</p><p>Shirone….is a bundle of joy. She is exactly like Vi. The trauma must have hit her really hard if she had been reduced to….to that thing, a puppet with muted emotions. Looking at the current Shirone who was as bright as the morning sun, it was hard to imagine.</p><p>Kuroka was of Vi’s age while Shirone was five years old right now.</p><p>I had taken the opportunity to Bind both of them.</p><p>Kuroka had been over the moon when she had heard the powers that she would get from the bindings.</p><p>Apparently she was developing an inferiority complex because Ophelia hadn’t taken her into her peerage and was keeping them away from her normal acquaintances. She thought that Ophelia might have been ashamed to have someone like her with her.</p><p>The Bindings helped remove those doubts and we explained the situation to her.</p><p>She was hidden under my orders because the Naberius connected with the Old Satan Faction might demand or try to plot to use Kuroka and Shirone for their results.</p><p>I know for a fact that the Naberius were working under the orders of Shalba to study Senjutsu in an attempt to create Super Devils.</p><p>I wonder what will happen now that I have taken Kuroka and Shirone with me.</p><p>There are no villages of Nekoshou as I had previously read in the fanfictions in my previous life and finding any Nekoshou was extremely hard. I haven’t found any in all this time either.</p><p>Like seriously a massacre like that would have started a war that the Devils wouldn’t dare even think about. Hunting an entire race because a reincarnated devil who was ‘previously’ of that race decided to rebel\\went mad, would have brought out the wrath of the already oppressed Reincarnated Devils on their masters not to mention the wrath of the other races whose members were being poached by the devils. The current Satans themselves would have killed the ones involved if only to satiate the anger of the other factions.</p><p>However, without the said experiments, Kuroka was not as strong as she was supposed to be. This will hopefully be compensated by the Binder’s and all the mini essences it grants those tagged with it help.</p><p>The commonly known Youkai are spirits which are either born from nature or born from Human feelings, both positive or negative. The former ones are generally known as Land Gods or Spirits and they sustain themselves with nature's energy….Senjustu. They are generally animals who live for a long time and have gained the ability to use senjutsu to extend their lives. They slowly change their forms and become Youkai. These Youkai can then reproduce normally and each of their children will be a Youkai.</p><p>The others born from Human emotions can be anything depending on the type of emotion they were born from and were called Ayakashi or Yoko, demonic spirits. At least that is the general view of the people. They used the fear of people as means of gaining power and fighting too.</p><p>Ayakashi are mostly evil in nature although they also have a sense of self and can change. These Ayakashi can also reproduce normally to give birth to Youkai children.</p><p>The difference however is that when a Spirit type of Youkai gives birth, the child carries the progress of their parents as well. For example a Nine Tailed Fox will give birth to another Nine Tailed Fox and there are no half breeds even with humans. All are full blooded Youkai. An example of such would be Kunou, the daughter of the Head of the Kyoto Youkai, Yasaka.</p><p>Ayakashi however do inherit the bloodlines of their parents but not their progress. A Nine Tailed Fox Ayakashi would give birth to a single tailed fox although it will be stronger than a normal single tailed fox. They can also be half-blooded and such even when mating with humans. An example of such would be, Rihan Nura, the son of Nurarihyon, the Supreme Leader of the Western Youkai.</p><p>That said, both types of Youkai can become stronger by two different methods. One, by simply living long. For example a simple Fox Youkai would gain a single tail every one hundred years. In nine hundred years, even if a Kitsune sleeps in a cave or eats potato chips while watching anime, it will become a Nine Tailed Fox. A being at High Ultimate Class to borderline Satan Class power.</p><p>Such a fucking cheat.</p><p>There are obviously more ways to increase their powers faster through training, fighting and other means.</p><p>Kuroka was a spirit type Youkai but her mother was a single tailed Nekoshou and thus she and Shirone were both the same.</p><p>That said, just like the Kitsune, they can also train to increase the number of tails that they possess.</p><p>There might be some doubts that Kuroka despite being a SS Class Stray devil with Ultimate Class strength still had only two tails? Then surely the method to measure the strength of the Youkai was wrong?</p><p>Not really. The Kuroka who was a SS Class stray devil was just that….a devil.</p><p>The devil heritage added to her powers but at the same time also suppressed her Youkai heritage which would have flourished much easier without any Demonic Powers present inside her. This time I intend to develop their powers to the best of their abilities.</p><p>A Nine tailed Nekoshou….I laughed maniacally at the mere thought and maybe just maybe….a ten tailed Youkai Goddess!.</p><p>These two are too precious to let anyone else get a hold of them.</p><p>According to my estimate, I want them to become at the very least as strong as an Ultimate Class Youkai by the time shit gets real.</p><p>A pure Ultimate Class Youkai would have a much better control over Senjutsu compared to the Half-Youkai, Half-Devil Hybrid.</p><p>The chaotic demonic powers not being there to deviate their minds are also a major reason.</p><p>Senjutsu is an art based on control and peace. A calm mind is a basic requirement for Senjutsu. The demonic power of devils is based on emotions and is violent and chaotic by nature. These two powers are completely different.</p><p>Trying to master the two at the same time would be extremely hard….and slow.</p><p>Thus no matter how I see it, despite the temporary boost from the Evil Pieces(if I manage to recreate them for myself), the change into devil is not a good thing for Kuroka and has to be put off.</p><p>_________________________________x__________________________________________________________________x_________________________________</p><p><strong>Beta Reader: LuluViBritania(FF.N, SB and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th BritannianEmperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note :</strong></p><p><strong>Phew. This chapter was originally supposed to have more parts but then I started writing and it kept becoming longer and longer until I completed only one part and found that almost 7k words were written.</strong></p><p><strong>If I decided to write more, that would have made this chapter around 16-20k long and would have taken a week longer at least.</strong></p><p><strong>So, I decided to post the chapter as it is with a slight infodump for the Youkai.</strong></p><p><strong>I know that Nurarihyon was a different series but it was included in the DxD LNs special chapters and I have read Nurarihyon being referred to as the leader of the Western Youkai. That said, as someone who has read the Nurarihyon series, I have noticed several differences between the DxD Youkai and the Nurarihyon Youkai. I thus decided to separate them both into two different types.</strong></p><p><strong>This would also help us understand why Kuroka and the others had different a number of tails while Kunou had nine tails from birth.</strong></p><p><strong>Anyways, Damien has had his first encounter against Rizevim(even if it was indirect) and we got to see the undercover moves being made.</strong></p><p><strong>I will explain other incidents that have happened over the last ten months in the next chapter.</strong></p><p><strong>This year is quite important after all.</strong></p><p><strong>Now, I have had some comments stating that Damien is too weak and has been entirely wasting his time.</strong></p><p><strong>(HAHAHAHA!)</strong></p><p><strong>Well, apart from giving me a hearty laugh I would like to clear this misunderstanding.</strong></p><p><strong>Information :</strong></p><p><strong>Damien Lucifer :</strong></p><p><strong>Age : 11 Years</strong></p><p><strong>Demonic Power : Borderline Satan Class.</strong></p><p><strong>Magical Prowess : High Ultimate Class in Elemental Magic, Barrier Magic. Low Satan Class with the Asmodeus House Trait, Mid Satan Class Mind Magic, High Satan Class with Illusions.</strong></p><p><strong>Gretel Lucifuge</strong></p><p><strong>Age : 13 years</strong></p><p><strong>Demonic Power : almost Mid Ultimate Class</strong></p><p><strong>Magical Prowess : Low Ultimate Class Ice Magic, High Ultimate Class Space magic, Peak High Class Barrier Magic, Low Ultimate Class Mind Magic.</strong></p><p><strong>Vienna Lucifer</strong></p><p><strong>Age : 8 years 6 months.</strong></p><p><strong>Demonic Power : Mid Class Devil.</strong></p><p><strong>Magical Prowess : Low High Class Mind Magic, Low High Class Elemental Magic.</strong></p><p><strong>Their fighting prowess will be slightly lower because they don’t have any experience fighting against others. This experience is the only reason why Damien will be ranked Ultimate Class instead of a Satan Class.</strong></p><p><strong>Now for the part of Damien being surpassed by Gretel, my question is….where?</strong></p><p><strong>The mere fact that an eleven year old Damien is someone who can destroy a country is already scary enough as it is. I don’t need anyone to say that he is under powered especially considering he is being monitored and any sudden increase in power could lead to others dissecting him for answers.

    "content": "<p><strong>Disclaimer : I own nothing.</strong></p><p><strong>Chapter 4 : Laying out the foundation.</strong></p><p><strong>- Damien –</strong></p><p>It has been a year since I took control of Katerea.</p><p>Many things have changed.</p><p>Some for the better while some for the worse.</p><p>It did make me realize my weakness. How I alone couldn’t control everything.</p><p>Power matters….but it could only take me so far.</p><p>After all Trihexa was strong, Ophis was strong and I know that the former was screwed over while the latter became no less than a mascot.</p><p>What is to say that even if I become as strong as them, I can’t just be sealed?</p><p>What I need is control.</p><p>I need to establish a team of my own. A force to back me up.</p><p>There is only so much a lone man can do after all.</p><p>I looked towards Katerea whose eyes were unfocused as she stared blankly in space.</p><p>She has been like this for a few minutes.</p><p>I ended the spell and she fell to her knees and looked all around, deep fear entrenched in her eyes.</p><p>“It seems like my work with Illusions are paying off if I can put you in one. I still need to work on my casting speed and power. Hmm….maybe Yojutsu will help. The fear system of the Western Youkai could help but only so much. Chakra, spiritual energy, fear, demonic power….do I really have to use ‘THAT’ to gain the last bit of advantage.” I mused to myself. “You can excuse yourself Katerea. Get leaned up and be back in 10 minutes.” I commanded offhandedly as I sat and took a sip of my tea.</p><p>The last four years I have focused my personal research solely on illusion and mind magic.</p><p>It picked up in speed after I gained the allegiance of Ophelia.</p><p>Her sources made gathering any information I wanted much easier. Infact her ‘Bewitching Voice’ was also an extremely strong trait when used perfectly.</p><p>Lord Paimon, her father, only used it to instigate the people to cause war and chaos. It is probably also a reason why he is so close to Rizevim. Fucking psychopaths.</p><p>I needed 30 seconds to use the spell on Katerea who is a mid satan class devil.</p><p>I don’t think any satan class would stand still for that long.</p><p>The goal was to develop a technique similar to Aizen’s Kyoka Suigetsu Kansen Saimin….taken to a whole nother level.</p><p>There are many ways in this world to detect other people so normal Kyoka Suigetsu wouldn’t work.</p><p>No.</p><p>My goal was to create an Illusion that can trap….Ajuka Beelzebub.</p><p>Anything less than that was a failure.</p><p>That said, even an estimate about the power of such an Illusion scared me.</p><p>That is not to say that I didn’t have any clue as to what to do. The Archmage was too good for that.</p><p>It is just that I didn’t want to use that option until I had no other way left at all.</p><p>I didn’t want to keep all my eggs in just one basket. What would I do if I had an enemy who had Clairvoyance or Future Sight? that is a one way road to fuck me.</p><p>Safe to say that normal Illusions were out the window.</p><p>The second part that I introduced to cover up the detection aspect of the Illusion was mind magic.</p><p>I had choices of using something of a notice-me-not charm aspect to my spell so that the target doesn’t really pay attention to the spell on them.</p><p>This obviously led to two problems – One, the fact that the second add on becomes and added component thus increasing the complexity of the spell and thus making the spell….ughh how do I say this….bulkier, which in turn makes it easier to detect which is a complete reverse of what I want the spell to do so that is out of the way. The second is the fact that if they don’t even realize that they are in an illusion(even when I tell them so myself), it makes any psychological methods of combat useless. That is what I call a bad illusion.</p><p>No….what I want is an illusion which even if the people realize they are caught in the Illusion, can’t do shit about it. I don’t want them to realize HOW it is that they were caught in the Illusion and…. if it is still active. That paranoia they experience when fighting me will be the greatest weapon I can use.</p><p>Easy to say, I was back to the drawing board.</p><p>So I thought of something else. I went back to the crux of the problem.</p><p>What I needed was for them to not realize how! they are caught under my spell, which is due to my energy inside their body. So obviously somehow I needed to hide that energy. This was however easier said than done. I needed to hide it in such a way that even magical diagnoses performed by Ajuka himself didn’t show any results.</p><p>I needed to make it….disappear.</p><p>And then it struck me….what I needed was to keep my energy in other’s body a secret….the Fidelius Charm.</p><p>Who cares if they figure out that they have my energy inside their bodies if they can’t even find it?</p><p>And thus the second part of the spell was ready.</p><p>I obviously had to take around a whole year to develop a suitable Fidelius. The concept of hiding a secret inside one’s soul did take a lot of time.</p><p>It was at this time that I wished I had the Sephiroth Graal.</p><p>Then came the third part.</p><p>Protecting the spell inside anyone.</p><p>I mean even if it is hidden there and people can’t find it, it doesn’t mean that they can’t make their energies go haywire for a while to break the illusion.</p><p>I mean even if a house is hidden, if someone drops a nuke in the general area, it can still be destroyed.</p><p>A big enough bomb works as well.</p><p>So how to protect it.</p><p>Also how to make it so that it can last long enough….I mean last forever.</p><p>After all, Kyoka Suigetsu’s Kansen Saimin lasted forever until broken.</p><p>I had to think about it forever and the few things I postulated all led to only one answer.</p><p>Aizen’s Zanpakuto was just too bloody cheating.</p><p>The only way a spell can last so long on someone even when they go through exercises almost on a regular basis like the 13 Court Guards did was one, if the user was constantly feeding it energy to prevent it from breaking which no matter how small the amount for a person would have sucked Aizen dry in a day.</p><p>Second, if the target was the source of that energy as well.</p><p>In general most beings produce energy of their own, souls or in general people of the Bleach universe produce Reiryoku no matter how small it is.</p><p>What Aizen’s Kansen Saimin did was use that very energy to constantly feed itself.</p><p>It was also one of the reasons why the spell was unbreakable….because as long as Reiryoku existed inside a person, they would remain under the Illusion while if someone became completely devoid of Reiryoku, they would simply die.</p><p>At least this was what my little brain could think of.</p><p>They will never realize the spell because the spell was being used by their own energy and they will never find it while their own energy cannot harm itself.</p><p>I had simply left all my research for a complete day and gone off to sleep when I had realized the sheer insanity of it.</p><p>The difficulty level just soared insanely because unlike Aizen, I was dealing with many races of people who use different types of energy.</p><p>A spell to manipulate different types of energy to form the spell when all the energies behave in unique manners is just….</p><p>It would have been very simple if I had seen Kyoka Suigetsu at work even once.</p><p>That is not to say that I stopped working on it.</p><p>If I have to understand how to cast that spell on everyone, then I will do so.</p><p>I have already completed the spell for the Devils and other beings with demonic energy as Katerea is an example of.</p><p>I still need to use it on other races….needless to say, it is a long term project. I do have an idea for it as well but it is so insane that even I had to laugh at the ridiculousness of it all.</p><p>But then again if someone like Ajuka Beelzebub was caught in simple Illusions, he wouldn’t be Ajuka Beelzebub.</p><p>This is the guy who designed a spell to search and erase anything supernatural from the internet.</p><p>The entire fucking internet.</p><p>The mind wipers from the Harry Potter world need a fucking lesson right here.</p><p>“These are the reports, Master.” My thoughts were interrupted by Katerea’s voice.</p><p>I looked and saw that she was carrying a file with black cover.</p><p>I promptly took and opened it and my lips turned up in a smile.</p><p>“So it seems that I was right. What is the progress on this one?” I asked Katerea and she stood straight.</p><p>“He was said to have a connection with a Devil and an old one at that.”</p><p>“It’s Mephisto Pheles, right. I know considering that I am the one who gave you this news after all. What I ask is if you have been able to contact him?”</p><p>“I have had some agents contact him. It was received quite well. Apparently the boy was quite insecure about his talents due to his very heritage. It made any agents we sent his way being accepted quite well.”</p><p>“In that case arrange a meeting. I wish to meet this person. I believe that you can arrange a way for me to be taken outside without anyone watching over you?”</p><p>She did look a little reluctant despite all her fear but I knew that it was nothing that she couldn’t do.</p><p>“It will be done Master.”</p><p>“Very well. Make it as soon as possible. Also no one should catch wind of this. What about the others?”</p><p>“The other one has been taken by Glynda Goodwitch when her Sacred Gear awakened. We have no idea where she is right now.” Her voice quivered when she reported the last part.</p><p>I slumped back down into my chair. I had expected it already.</p><p>The time for that had already passed….not that I had expected anything in the first place. The fact that there was even a match in this case was already a miracle. I had only even asked for this because she was supposed to have been born before me and any butterflies wouldn’t have affected her being born or her sacred gear.</p><p><em>“Any news about the Vampires?” </em>I thought in my mental link with Ophelia.</p><p><em>“Yes Master. I have been able to secure a trade alliance with the Vampires. The Tepes faction producing bloodstones have been specially welcoming.” </em>Her voice calmly replied through the link.</p><p><em>“Did you hear any news about any child in the Vladi House? A Dhampir to be precise along with a Damphir of the Tepes as well.” </em>I asked back.</p><p><em>“We haven’t been so close as to enquire into such things directly but I did receive some information from the servants and a few other nobles who seemed to be enthralled by a prospect of trading with us or simply receiving of favour.”</em> She replied.</p><p>“What exactly did you learn?”</p><p><em>“Your information was correct, Master. The Tepes Head has a daughter with a human woman. She is obviously not treated well like any other half-blooded vampires. Apparently she is also close to something called the ‘Monster of the Dungeons’. I haven’t been able to hear anything more concrete about this person due to this being a well-kept secret but there are rumors of it being involved with the death of a concubine of a High Ranking Vampire.”</em> She replied back.</p><p><em>“Very well. Keep an eye on the situation but do not make it look like you are looking into it. This task is extremely important to us. The girl possibly has a very high level sacred gear. Just keep an eye on her and if she or the other person tries to escape, take them in as soon as possible. Also, if any other Devil is seen lurking around, inform me directly. Do not engage them. Do not contact them.”</em> I ordered.</p><p><em> “Any information about the other targets I told you about?”</em> I asked, leaning back.</p><p><em>“The case with Cleria Belial has some undercurrents that are not profitable for us to interfere in for now. I wouldn't have even known about it if you hadn’t warned me about it. The location of the Holy Sword Project is still being investigated. The church seems to be putting a lot of stress on it after their Project Siegfried was a disaster. The other targets haven’t awakened their Sacred Gears yet. On a positive note, I have found the pair of Nekoshou that you had asked me to inquire about. Contracting the Naberius had been easy enough, though it did take some time to narrow down who it was you wanted to find. I found the two and the elder one seems to be around seven or eight years old while the younger one is three to four years of age. Their mother had recently passed away and she was a servant, a maid in particular, not a peerage member of the Nabeirus Branch member. They have no legal right over her. I did arrange for them to be discreetly taken away to a specialized location and am only waiting for your orders.”</em> She gave her report to me.</p><p><em>“They might still have a claim over the two sisters as a scientist under the Naberius is the father of the two Nekoshou. It is obvious though that he doesn’t care about the two however as I doubt that he even knew that they were his daughters. That said, when we start our plans, they can interfere using this relation and demand a claim over the two sisters. If possible, make sure that he is finished off….preferably in an accident though. Make sure that the two sisters disappear and it appears as if they encountered an unfortunate accident when you take them away. Taking them away is important because the elder might be recruited by a member of the Branch Family and that would be a problematic situation to deal with.”</em> I instructed after thinking over the plans. <em>“Do you have any idea about the whereabouts of any other Nekoshous?”</em> I asked in hope.</p><p>“<em>My apologies. It is still being investigated. I did find out that the mother of the two girls was a resident of the Eastern Youkai under Nurarihyon. They have a clan of Cat Youkai there and one of his Lieutenants is a seven-tailed Nekomata named Magari. From there she moved to follow a human man she loved, which as I was just informed earlier by you is a scientist for the </em><a href=\"https://Naberius….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Naberius….it</a><em> will make it easier to narrow down the search.</em>” She completed a little disappointed.</p><p><em>“No need to take any unnecessary risks. Our strength is not enough to be able to afford being doubted by anyone right now. I am finding a method for you to be able to take down our opponents in a less conspicuous way soon enough. By the way, have there been anymore orders from the Old Satan Faction?”</em> I asked.</p><p><em>“I-its Master….”</em></p><p>I caught the hesitation in her voice and raised an eyebrow to myself. <em>“What is the matter, Ophelia?”</em></p><p><em>“I was given an order today.”</em> She answered meekly….fear lacing her tone. However unlike Katerea, her fear stemmed from disappointing me rather than me trying to hurt her.</p><p><em>“What order?”</em> I insisted.</p><p><em>“I was ordered to brainwash Gretel Lucifuge to make her loyal to Euclid Lucifuge, make her acceptable to all of his orders without absolutely any question. They want me to subtly program her over time.”</em> she answered in a low voice and then became quiet.</p><p>I absolutely quieted down for a moment.</p><p>Thousands of thoughts running in my mind.</p><p>Gretel….I have vowed to protect her….or at least take revenge for her if she joined me and she had blindly decided to put all her trust in me.</p><p>A sinister part of my mind laughed at the childish naivety but I forcibly crushed that thought with all the brutality I could muster to defend the honour and innocence of the one person whom I call my first friend in this world.</p><p>I had already decided that I needed to make Euclid pay….very dearly for all the….all the sufferings that were suffered by Gretel and when I think he couldn’t drop any lower, I am always amazed.</p><p>When Gretel was behind in her Ice Magic, she was being scolded and physically hit for it. Now however when she was improving with my nerfed Essences, she was being harassed in a whole different manner.</p><p>The worst part is that Gretel refuses to tell me anything about it. I did read her surface thoughts and found that she wanted to prove to me that she was strong and not disappoint me with every problem. So, she simply smiles every time we meet. I could see that she was starting to sometimes have dark circles under her eyes which for an ultimate class devil was saying something.</p><p>I had even ordered her to tell me….without using any compulsion though and she had begged on her knee to let her handle this….that she wanted to prove herself.</p><p>I was almost blank that day….until I realized that….she didn’t want to prove herself to me….She wanted to prove herself to…her own self then.</p><p>Gretel’s inferiority complex and crippling fear ran very deep and she was making an effort to fight it, to go against it on her own to prove to herself that she was worthy of being with me.</p><p>I tried to open my mouth several times but no words came out when I saw her face….her teary eyes.</p><p>This was the first time that Gretel had asked me for something….I just couldn’t say no at all then to her, no matter how much I wanted to.</p><p>Thankfully my Occlumency levels are now extremely high since I practiced with my Shadow Clones so I reigned my temper in and replied.</p><p><em>“Okay. You are to give them a false time with a reason that Gretel is very advanced in mind arts due to her practice with me. Tell them that it would take around five years to complete the work. If they do not agree, point out that Gretel Lucifuge is currently ultimate class even if only a low ultimate class level.”</em> I answered in an extremely even tone. My mind throwing aside any signs of emotions with my Occlumency because I knew it would be nothing positive. <em>“I will inform Gretel about it. You are to help Gretel increase her mind magic to the levels where even your father can’t touch her mind.”</em></p><p><em>“Yes Master, it will be done.”</em> With that I felt the telepathic link cut off.</p><p>I closed my eyes and thought about my future plans.</p><p>As long as the Illusion is not ready, I will not be safe if we run away. Casting it on others will only be useful if I can have them lower their guards for me.</p><p>The Binder slots are all counted. I have to prepare them for the eventualities.</p><p>No matter how I calculate, it is still three and a half to four years for me to establish a base where I can comfortably separate from them.</p><p>But….things won’t be quiet until then.</p><p>Razevan’s own jealousy had been focused on me after a few of Rizevim’s comments. I never paid any attention to any of this and he doesn’t dare try anything with me. This had led to the load being increased on Aria and Vienna. I couldn’t take it at all and had even asked Aria if she wanted me to interfere. The sight of blood on her lips had made me plan ways to butcher that son of a bitch then and there but Aria had known me too much for my own good.</p><p>She made me promise to absolutely stay out of this and to not hurt Razevan until he first attacks me, making me swear on her life. The only thing she asked me was to protect Vienna.</p><p>I can’t understand why she is still so insistent on protecting Razevan. Even Stockholm’s must have a limit right?</p><p>Yet, I couldn’t take it when she just smiled and hugged me while saying it will all be fine.</p><p>This woman was my mother for all sense and purposes. She has raised me as her own child….I can sense her emotions all the time and that is why I know that she has no bad intentions and doesn’t think of me as any different from Vienna. This makes it all the more painful.</p><p>Why are all the females in my life so….complicated?</p><p>Yes…. All.</p><p>This includes Vienna as well.</p><p>Vienna Lucifer awakened the Divine Dividing sacred gear at the age of seven, half, a year ago….and things turned worse.</p><p>Rizevim’s provocations along with the jealousy of Razevan soared after this event.</p><p>I still don’t understand why Razevan would be jealous of his own daughter. If he is so jealous, then why doesn’t he train?</p><p>These reasons have forced me to accelerate my plans.</p><p>However this is easier said than done. If anyone finds even a hint of this, it could turn into a shit show extremely fast. Katerea can cover for me but not that much.</p><p>No matter how much these people flutter around, Rizevim is still the one who keeps them all under control. I don’t have a shred of doubt that if Katerea displeased him even once, she would be killed.</p><p>Katerea’s sources are vital for me.</p><p>Ophelia’s people can move freely in the light using her business and networks and it has its problems as well. Katerea’s people have no such problems and can do many of the darker works openly….that said their identities make it difficult for them to get around.</p><p>Currently I am having Katerea focus on getting sacred gear wielders. She is using it under the agenda that it could be used against the ‘False Satans’.</p><p>Rizevim is not really bothered by it because of his abilities. He can negate Sacred Gear. His overconfidence blinds him to any idea of this being the plans of a coup.</p><p>The ability, as absurd as it is, is still half baked compared to the true ability.</p><p>Rizevim just couldn’t fill Lucifer’s shoes in this one.</p><p>Despite the extremely high demonic power, the skill at using the Unique Trait of the Lucifer is still not strong enough for Rizevim.</p><p>The reason why this hasn’t been revealed is because Razevan hasn’t inherited this trait and neither has Vienna….yet.</p><p>I have seen and analyzed his powers already and can use it to some extent but haven’t shown it in front of anyone.</p><p>I did figure things about the Lucifer trait though.</p><p>It is the same as the Uzumaki.</p><p>Enormous reserves and….too many unique abilities.</p><p>My personal ability is something I haven’t yet discovered yet.</p><p>In the meantime I did get an alliance with someone trustworthy – The White Dragon Emperor, Albion.</p><p>Vienna stayed close to me since her Sacred Gear awakened even more than before.</p><p>It did help ease the suffocating tension in the house a little however. It was once when she was asleep that I probed her Sacred Gear using Legilimens for the first time ever.</p><p>It was through my clone though. I have to say that the sight of a hundred meters tall White and Blue dragon was something to behold.</p><p>He was more surprised than I had expected and showered my clone’s consciousness with his poison breath.</p><p>Safe to say that I had to send another clone to work when my first clone popped.</p><p>The second meeting was much calmer however.</p><p>I don’t know about Ddraig but Albion is a very calm dragon….when he is not pissed at the very least.</p><p>We had a very pleasant conversation. After enquiring how I was inside this place, he sat down and talked to me for a long time.</p><p>I did find out that he had no intentions of harming Vienna. It was merely their hosts who get drunk on power and use life threatening powers(Juggernaut Drive) when someone shows them their place and hurts their fragile egos.</p><p>The Dragon part does help in that a little too.</p><p>Dragons tend to be aggressive.</p><p>Almost every single dragon is like that.</p><p>The Divine Dividing made a small part of her into a Dragon and this part makes her a bit impulsive. The wills of the previous wielders of the Divine Dividing inside the Sacred Gear didn’t help either. They were the prime examples of what we call ‘Sore Losers’. because they died of their foolishness, they want to drive others insane and kill themselves similarly too.</p><p>With this in mind, the first task that I decided upon was teaching Occlumency to Vienna. I can’t have my sweet Vi going Juggernaut and throwing her lifespan away.</p><p>Perhaps the Occlumency and mind magic will also help her strengthen her mind and overcome the remnants of the wills of the previous users of the Divine Dividing.</p><p>After all it was a fight inside her mind.</p><p>I could care less because if she was endangered, I would go inside and tear apart all their wills myself.</p><p>The meeting with Albion made me think of a ridiculous thought.</p><p>Albion’s soul is sealed inside of the Divine Dividing Sacred Gear….so what would happen now if I used The Binder’s Essence on him in this sealed state?</p><p>Will I be able to summon him into the void like all the souls bound by The Binder’s Essence?</p><p>Will I be able to create a new body for Albion?</p><p>I thought about it and realized that there were two main problems right now.</p><p>First being that I didn’t have enough strength for that.</p><p>Albion at his prime was as strong as Sirzechs’s True Form at the very least….and that’s without going into outrage.</p><p>I don’t think I can reach that level of power anytime soon.</p><p>The second was that Divine Dividing was made by ‘The God of the Bible’ who was a Genius beyond compare.</p><p>Like sure Ajuka had invented the Evil Pieces to reincarnate humans into Devils but The Biblical God had done the same for Metatron ages ago.</p><p>He just didn’t make it into technology and distribute it among others.</p><p>He didn’t really have any reason to.</p><p>Safe to say that I am nowhere near the level of cracking this right now.</p><p>I however have no doubts that I can do so in time.</p><p>The Archmage Essence and Lucifer’s original power which is an advanced form of Rizevim’s power, the Sacred Gear Canceller is….Negating the Divine Powers.</p><p>If I can advance it to the level of the previous Lucifer, I do hope that I can get a Heavenly Dragon as a team member too.</p><p>As for Vienna, the Essences even in their nerfed forms would make sure that she would be as strong as a super devil by the time she reaches twenty.</p><p>I did make an agreement with Albion to keep a watch over Vienna though and in return I will find a way for him to be free again.</p><p>“Katerea, arrange a meeting with the target as soon as possible. You can make an excuse of taking me outside for some experience. A fight if possible.” I breathed out.</p><p>This much thinking was causing me to have a serious level of stress.</p><p>Maybe letting it all out will help.</p><p>“I-I will arrange for it My Lord.” She said and I got up and walked towards the door.</p><p>“In that case, our lesson ends today.”</p><p><strong>- Scene Change –</strong></p><p>I looked at the scrolls of parchment in front of me.</p><p>These parchments are a way of speeding up the plans that I have thought of.</p><p>It is a little dangerous but something that I can get out of unscathed even if these are found out. These can never be tracked down to me.</p><p>The scrolls are made up of contracts with The Broker Essence which is a pact that asks for complete and undying Loyalty to the writer.</p><p>These scrolls have a seal which has a pact to open it as well. If the seal is opened by someone, the pact is considered accepted and if not, the writing destroys itself.</p><p>I have made similar contracts to extract sacred gears which will be transferred to me automatically. The price will be negotiated before signing if any.</p><p>I am particularly sure that Katerea will simply forgo the negotiating part and try to beat the other party into signing the contract.</p><p>To avoid any complications from this, I made a clause that any memory about the Deal will be completely removed from the target’s mind.</p><p>I know Katerea will not try to do anything too outward due to the conditions I have set on her but some extra bit of caution never hurts.</p><p>These can help the collection of sacred gears quite fast.</p><p>I have to make another for the collection of unique powers.</p><p>Those will need finer details to them due to many complicated kinds of powers however.</p><p>I stored the scrolls in my hammer space and massaged my head.</p><p>I could trade demonic power too….but with the number of times I am tested, I would be found out in an instant.</p><p>This plan has to wait till I am ready to be out of this place.</p><p>The people normally think that as a losing party, the Old Satan Faction doesn’t have enough reach.</p><p>Well, they would be very surprised.</p><p>Among the current thirty four surviving Pillars, seven are siding with the Old Satans and work together in secret.</p><p>Then there is the matter of the so-called extinct houses, whereas actually twelve of these Houses are alive and actually thriving, no small contribution to the experiments and drugs though.</p><p>The Civil War was far more political than it was shown outwardly.</p><p>The root being the descendants of the Old Satans but at some place also Zekram Bael.</p><p>While people say that Zekram Bael wants the good for the Devil Race and puts it above all, it is not completely right.</p><p>The Old Satan descendants were complete fucks back then but the extinction of more than a few Houses laid in the hands of Zekram Bael too.</p><p>The Houses which stayed neutral. And ones when pressured to join with the other side to save their hides, they were then simply vilified.</p><p>The aim of this was to remove political competitors.</p><p>Then all of the cliques who were directly under Zekram were promoted to high positions.</p><p>It was not really all coincidences that the only strong Devils that survived that war were the clique of Sirzechs who was directly related to Zekram.</p><p>If I had to relate him to anyone, I would say….Danzo.</p><p>Similarly the case of Cleria Belial would also be the same.</p><p>If I had to predict, I would say that Cleria didn’t find out about the King Pieces all on her own coincidently.</p><p>The Emperor was becoming a popular figure among the masses and had the Strength to back it up too….real strength and not due to doping so controlling him through blackmail would be impossible.</p><p>A more political play to make the Belial’s name turn bad however would work.</p><p>After all…. simply fucking a priest doesn’t deserve a death sentence.</p><p>Thousands of devils have fucked nuns and priests over time.</p><p>It might….just might have been the doing of Rizevim….but knowing the person he normally is, it’s doubtable.</p><p>Rizevim doesn’t do subtleties. He is the type to hurt someone while showing that it was him who did it and even taunt the other party.</p><p>No….this type of move was different.</p><p>Unfortunately I don’t have much power to do anything about her right now but maybe….just maybe I could later on turn Diehauser to my side.</p><p>The Worthless ability matched with my Archmage Essence and demonic power would be phenomenal.</p><p>To be honest, I am more surprised why Belials are not ranked higher.</p><p>Knowing how much work is put under the use of this ability, I wouldn’t doubt anyone if they told me that Diehauser Belial has more understanding of magic and powers than three of the four Satans.</p><p>Such a person would be a boon for me to have on my side.</p><p>Now, just how to get him to side with me.</p><p>A meeting with Cleria is impossible….</p><p>Then what?</p><p>I tried to remember the names of other potential recruits for myself.</p><p>Ophelia had arranged it quite well.</p><p>They mainly consisted of the Neutrals who didn’t want to fight and were forced to. The second group were the ones who were not treated well by the current government.</p><p>Not everything was sunshine and lilies.</p><p>The Belial House’s own head had to sell off his clothes and his wife had to sell off her jewelry to send their Heir to school. This shows that not even the Pillar Houses were all Hunkey-Dunkey. Some were oppressed by the others under the guise of laws. The territory distribution also saw to it.</p><p>This made it hard for them to gain money faster.</p><p>The laws on Devil Contracts didn’t help either.</p><p>If I could make even a few of them to side with me, I can expand my network much bigger.</p><p>Some might ask me why am I even doing these things?</p><p>The answer would be simple.</p><p>It is because this is a dog eat dog world!.</p><p>In this world, only just because I want the others to leave me alone, doesn’t mean others would leave me be.</p><p>Either control or remove is the way of the world.</p><p>The only way to get out of it is to become so strong or so important that they either couldn’t do anything to you or have to tolerate you despite their crappy insecurities.</p><p>And my case is special even among these anomalies.</p><p>My power and potential aside, my very name could cause too many waves if disclosed. The fact that a child was born from the blood of two Satans….directly will make me a symbol that can be used to heavily influence the Devil race.</p><p>This would make me a thorn on the side of all the current leaders of the three factions and when I leave the Old Satan Faction….to them too.</p><p>This network will help me collect leverage on the people who matter.</p><p>I was broken from my thoughts by movement beside me and I looked at the adorable ball of cuteness holding onto my waist while drooling at the corner of her mouth and even in this situation, the scene brought a smile to my face. Vienna always makes my day happier, no matter the time.</p><p>I had brought her with me on the pretext of playing and we did play around but then she fell asleep. I just couldn’t bear to wake her up.</p><p>It will also give Aria some time to rest.</p><p>However, today there was something I needed to do.</p><p>I caressed her head for a while and when she relaxed, I removed her arm from my waist and put a pillow in my place and then leaned in to kiss her forehead.</p><p>She opened her eyes and held onto my fingers, “Where are you going Dummy?”</p><p>She whispered very softly.</p><p>I smiled at her while patting her head with my free hand. “I need to go for a mission today. I will tell you the story about it when I get back tonight, okay?”</p><p>She looked every bit reluctant for this but if today hadn’t been something that had been organized by Ophelia and Katerea together with much effort, I would have even relented.</p><p>….but this is necessary.</p><p>This is for our own future and Vi’s own safety as well.</p><p>“You can stay in my room and only go out when Aria calls you, okay? In the meantime you can play the games I bought yesterday.” I kissed her forehead lightly again as she nodded.</p><p>Unlike me who got Gretel, she has no one to even call a friend…. I am somewhat of a big brother to her, even if she never calls me one. She has been too adamant about it since she was five and I didn’t force it.</p><p>It made me realize that she and Gretel had been isolated without anyone of their own age for years. I didn’t count myself to be the same because of my mental age right now. This has led them to stick onto me and each other as a source of support. Gretel has it even worse because unlike Vi who has me and Aria, she doesn’t have anyone though.</p><p>I got up and flushed those thoughts aside. Today….I can’t afford to mess up.</p><p>I had plans to carry on….plans that might bring forward my estimates by a year if I succeeded at it.</p><p>“Good Luck for work, Dummy.” She called out from behind me and I smiled at her and left after waving at her.</p><p><strong>- Ophelia Paimon –</strong></p><p>Ophelia Paimon looked around towards her guests and smiled, quite satisfied at what was before her.</p><p>The five that were sitting in the room right now were among the most renowned devils of her generation.</p><p>Not in terms of strength maybe but in terms of network and influence. Each one of them held important posts or connections in their families that could be used to gain support easily.</p><p>Her Master had been quite adamant about building a support base among the people without attracting any unwanted attention. She had her business but that could only reach so far.</p><p>The moment someone doubts her, most of her resources will come to a standstill and thus necessary preparations are to be made.</p><p>The five currently in front of her were a part of this.</p><p>Alicia Sallos, the Lady of House Sallos, Ranked Duke, was someone similar to herself. She had taken the position as the Head of her House after her parents retired after the Civil War. However in her case, she had the support of her parents and thus it was easier for her to establish herself as the number one actress of the Underworld.</p><p>Serafall Leviathan might have a higher position in the popularity polls but that was only due to her position as a Satan.</p><p>Alicia was a renowned social worker.</p><p>The Sallos were the Generals and had the gift of insight.</p><p>This led them to establish a prospering business in the Underworld as well as a few other factions.</p><p>Her business especially flourished when it came to stock markets in the human world.</p><p>The number of successful business ventures she had in the human world were many.</p><p>Infact while it is not well known, Alicia was one of the richest people in the human world.</p><p>Her network would make it easier to find Sacred Gear users among the humans.</p><p>Helena Dantalion, the second in line for the Head position of House Dantalion, Ranked Duke is the younger sister of Lord Dantalion.</p><p>Her elder brother is the current Lord and his son the current heir but that didn’t make her position any worse.</p><p>Helena Dantalion was one of the best scholars among the devils and while not at the level of Ajuka Beelzebub, she was a person whose talents were recognized by many.</p><p>She had a lot of connections among the education sector of the Underworld.</p><p>The next person was Victoria Valac. A member of the Valac’s Branch House.</p><p>The Valac’s Clan Trait alone makes them invaluable for most people.</p><p>Seeker’s Eye, while not an offensive trait, was bordering on cheating. It was one of the reasons why the Valac’s were not sent to the frontlines or even in The Great War by the Satans and were still valued so highly in the Underworld.</p><p>The Seeker’s Eye guided the user to whatever they wished for. It obviously doesn’t give out the direct location but the users desire or rather gravitates towards the particular wish.</p><p>It has many conditions and restrictions and the User’s experience and control matters a lot for selective use. A normal user might have a negligible tingling in their minds while an experienced user might have a much stronger feeling.</p><p>This made the Valac’s a one of the most wanted Houses others wanted to marry.</p><p>Victoria, while not known by many, not even her own house, was the strongest user of Seeker’s Eyes.</p><p>She knowing her condition hid her abilities so that she is not sold off as some goods on high demand.</p><p>Victoria had started working for her around a century ago and had shown remarkable skill in business. They had grown closer and Ophelia had taken her under her own wing.</p><p>She had confided with her about her powers when she was confronted by her and she had made Victoria her personal secretary.</p><p>The fourth person was Charlene Glasya-Labolas, the Heiress of the Glasya-Labolas House, Ranked Earl and….the younger sister of Falbium Asmodeus.</p><p>The Glasya-Labolas were a military family and that was also partly due to the Satan Asmodeus being the chief strategist and in-charge of the Devil's armies.</p><p>The thing about the Satans being neutral and not favouring a single house, let alone their own….is a load of crap.</p><p>If that had been the case then all the idiocy that Serafall Leviathan does to spread news about her sister would never happen.</p><p>If anyone even remotely follows this law, it would be Ajuka Beelzebub.</p><p>The other three are extremely involved with their families.</p><p>Falbium is the same. Infact while he doesn’t show it outside, he is more involved than the other two.</p><p>The other two don’t involve their families with their work.</p><p>Falbium on the other hand takes the help of his family to maintain the reports of the armies as well as many other works.</p><p>This was mainly done by Charlene Glasya-Labolas.</p><p>The final person however was a surprise to even her.</p><p>While she had sent the invitation, she herself hadn’t expected her to arrive today.</p><p>Cleria Belial was hardly someone who attended parties after all.</p><p>So her surprise was reasonable when the Belial arrived at the party.</p><p>Her Master had been wanting to get into contact with her but had brushed it aside as something that was too difficult to do without attracting the wrong kind of attention.</p><p>This was disguised as a normal meeting of friends which was quite reasonable as she had a healthy friendship with everyone.</p><p>She wondered how surprised her master will be.</p><p>While his cold and collected face was cute. She always liked watching him break that façade whenever possible.</p><p>The maid brought tea and snacks by then and had left the ladies alone.</p><p>“So, what is the secret Ophelia?” Helena chimed in from beside her.</p><p>She raised her eyebrows.</p><p>“Oh, please don’t pull that one on me. Come out with it. Who are you seeing?”</p><p>The other girls seemed equally intrigued by the sudden question and Ophelia had to do a double-take and consider what had led her to this.</p><p>“I mean, look at your skin. That smile. It is not the usual business looks that you give people. I am telling you all, this is the look of a maiden in love.”</p><p>Ophelia rolled her eyes.</p><p>Her Master’s Essences had increased her attractiveness a lot along with her powers.</p><p>Love however….she had to think. Her Master was without a doubt someone who would be the top choice for any female Devil in a few years.</p><p>She had never seen him smile yet. Then again all their meetings had been inside the classroom and Damien Lucifer was a Master at maintaining a mask. He was years if not decades above his physical age and at times Ophelia had wondered if one of the original satans, if Lucifer himself had reincarnated into his body.</p><p>Her case had been different as she had to keep the façade of the successful Head of the House while attending to the business of the Old Satan Faction as well.</p><p>Her father’s foolishness had led to the death of her mother and left her newborn brother without a parent all this time.</p><p>She had raised him as her own son and it forced a young Ophelia to grow a lot more than even she had expected initially.</p><p>And she was proud to say that little Ace had grown into a fine man.</p><p>As for her dating someone, she just couldn’t even think of anything like that.</p><p>Her husband would have to be someone secretly aligned with the Old Satan Faction or someone neutral and under her control and if she knew her father, only for show while he forced her to have a child with some other higher ups of the Old Satan Faction. She just couldn’t allow any of this.</p><p>It was through great effort that she had kept Ace uninvolved in all this.</p><p>So that even if she was caught, he would have a way out.</p><p>Bringing a husband from the Old Satan Faction aligned Houses would put all her plans into jeopardy.</p><p>As for the question….her Master….maybe in a few years if he wanted. After all he was someone who already knew everything about her….things that she kept from the whole world too.</p><p>“Ohhhh just look at her, lost in her thoughts….so spill already.” Helena prodded.</p><p>Alicia and Charlene enjoying the moment a little too much too while Victoria had a slight smile on her lips and Cleria looked equally amused.</p><p>“It is no <a href=\"https://one….at\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">one….at</a> least not anytime soon.” She whispered the last part giving the girls something to talk about.</p><p>The girls showered her with questions which she diverted but gave them some false hints about having a tryst with a Human during one of her visits in the Human World for travel. It was a one time thing and nothing else.</p><p>She was the Head of her house. If anyone wanted to marry her, they will have to marry into her house. Keeping her virginity wasn’t something she was obligated to do.</p><p>“If we are on this topic however….you all seem to have ignored Cleria. She has the same look as well.” she expertly diverted the conversation towards the now stunned Cleria who looked like a deer caught in headlights.</p><p>“W-what are you talking about Ophelia? There is no one.” She hurriedly denied it.</p><p>Her stutter was like blood to hungry sharks around her and they pounced on her metaphorically.</p><p>She however didn’t reveal any details. Only a somewhat similar answer to hers.</p><p>The party was going on until her guests suddenly started to fall dizzy.</p><p>The confusing part however was that no one noticed anything.</p><p>The first one to fall was Helena and she was soon followed by Alicia, Victoria, Cleria and then Charlene.</p><p>What truly stunned Ophelia was that none of her guests even knew what happened or showed any kind of reaction at watching others fall suddenly.</p><p>When the last person fell silent, she heard footsteps coming from behind her.</p><p>Looking around she saw her Master, Damien Lucifer walk in followed by Katerea Leviathan.</p><p>He still had that calm and stoic look on his face as he looked at the downed bodies of the women.</p><p>Then he turned to her and for the first time Ophelia saw her Master smile and it was….adorable.</p><p>“You have a beautiful house, Ophelia. Won’t you show me around? This is my first time out after all.”</p><p>Ophelia was stunned and looking at the eyes of Katerea Leviathan, she seemed to have a similar reaction.</p><p>He understood it and laughed softly, “What? Just because I don’t smile out in the open doesn’t mean that I can’t or that I don’t like to. We don’t have sex in the open and yet most people still like and want to….so then why is my smile being blamed here.”</p><p>Ophelia had her mouth hung open for a moment….unable to reply at all….before she saw that mischievous smile on his face and burst into laughter.</p><p>It seems like she will be repaid well for her part in the plan today. Knowing her young Master smiled was a good enough payment after all.</p><p>________________________________x__________________________________________________________________x__________________________________</p><p><strong>Beta Reader: LuluViBritania(FF.N, SB and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th BritannianEmperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note :</strong></p><p><strong>Phew….I tried to give out Damien’s plans for the future and the reasons why he is not taking any overt steps right now.</strong></p><p><strong>Damien is still learning.</strong></p><p><strong>You have to notice that not everyone can plan perfectly or has a certain mindset from the very start. Especially someone like Damien who still has the memories of his previous life.</strong></p><p><strong>As a teenager, he might have been a little angsty but his rebirth has forced him to mature faster.</strong></p><p><strong>The one who wanted to conquer the world in the first chapter simply just because he was a reincarnator has been replaced by a colder and more mature version of him trying to survive.</strong></p><p><strong>You also have to remember that while it has only been four chapters for us, it has been ten hellish years for Damien.</strong></p><p><strong>Ten years can change anyone.</strong></p><p><strong>New relations are formed and people are influenced by others.</strong></p><p><strong>I have read many and I do mean….many fics where the MC trains solitary for a decade, and all the while nothing in the world changes due to him and then when the ‘plot’ starts, he is still in the same mindset.</strong></p><p><strong>Like the hormones, and the psychological effects have no work here at all.</strong></p><p><strong>People change and I want Damien to experience growth too.</strong></p><p><strong>Don’t expect a flawless protagonist in Damien.</strong></p><p><strong>Damien will have his flaws. He will make mistakes and he will learn from those mistakes.</strong></p><p><strong>This is what growth is.</strong></p><p><strong>This chapter dealt with Damien’s current plans and a look into the current situation.</strong></p><p><strong>We also saw what and how Damien views the political scene of the Underworld as. Do remember that these are his own thoughts and there might be some changes too because Damien is not Omniscient.</strong></p><p><strong>I added a few more characters and for a world like DxD, a few more characters are nothing.</strong></p><p><strong>I do have to point out that the original Heir of the Glasya-Labolas died or was murdered, I don’t remember particularly but the one in the Youth Devil’s Meeting was the second-in-line who was taken as an heir.</strong></p><p><strong>The name of the deceased Heir was never mentioned but here Charlene is her.</strong></p><p><strong>We also learned about Ophelia’s life here.</strong></p><p><strong>What exactly does Damien plan on doing with these five will be shown soon enough in the next chapter.</strong></p><p><strong>I would also like to point out that this is a fic. I will be doing some original parts so if you find something that doesn’t match with the LNs don’t shout at me. I am trying to make sense here and Ichibumi’s writing is vehemently against it.</strong></p><p><strong>This world doesn’t have any plot armour or sudden protagonist aura so don’t expect things like in the anime here.</strong></p><p><strong>Anyways, enjoy the chapter.</strong></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p> </p><p><br></p>",

An organization of idiots who want to take over the world despite being thrown out of their own homes and not being able to do anything about it.</p><p>I truly worry about the sanity of these idiots….or their IQs sometimes.</p><p>That said….was this even the world that I knew of?</p><p>I had to take a full month to convince myself that I am in this messed up world and stuck in a den of psychopathic terrorists.</p><p>Almost nothing was shown about them except the fights where they died.</p><p>Like three times and they all died in the very first fight.</p><p>Except for Rizevim, the amount of screen time they got was less than a single episode.</p><p>If that didn’t tell someone about their condition, then I don’t know what would.</p><p>These were the thoughts that ran through my head in the first month.</p><p>There was not even a mention of the name Damien in the entire LNs. Was I a new character? or was I someone who had originally died before even getting a mention at all. These thoughts plagued my mind. Existential Crisis at its finest.</p><p>I guess being shut in an observation pod for two years didn’t do my mind much favours.</p><p>If this is the same world or not, I didn’t know. There were already a few indications that my existence has changed a few things. If the real Damien was someone who was supposed to not even exist or die without any mention, I had no idea. The one thing that I knew for sure was that….I am going to mark this world with my own bloody name.</p><p>I will not be forgotten like a side character.</p><p><em>Baam</em>.</p><p>A servant fell while walking beside me.</p><p><em>Sigh.</em></p><p>This is something I have been trying to control as well.</p><p>I have no idea how but I have awakened Conqueror’s Haki. It might have been when I died.</p><p>The problem with this is control.</p><p>I am basically a Naruto in this case.</p><p>Umm, not the idiot ‘I wanna be a Satan’ or something like that Naruto(I would have shot myself before doing that). I mean in terms of willpower, I have….well an infinite amount of willpower.</p><p>The first time my death might have been due to being crushed under my own haki.</p><p>I always prevent that line of thought though. That was embarrassing to even think about.</p><p>Anyways, this didn’t automatically make me a Hokage as you can guess.</p><p>It is basically a reservoir of power that I can access. The pipe which draws from it is still my body. I have to train myself to make the pipe bigger.</p><p>Peak Human is nothing in comparison to a devil’s physique.</p><p>Even then idiots who do not! work out, like ever….still have physiques much much stronger than a base human.</p><p>A High Class devil is physically 20 times stronger than a normal human….without training.</p><p>Let’s not talk about ultimate class, satan class and super class.</p><p>I will however have to train my physique.</p><p>What I have to worry about now is controlling this power.</p><p>My body has been strengthened quite nicely due to my race….but it is still not enough to completely suppress the flow of the haki that always tries to erupt from my body when I lose control of my emotions.</p><p>I have been told to do some mental exercises by the doctor.</p><p>I know it is quite evasive for a doctor and I would have normally called him a quack if I didn’t know the reason for it.</p><p>The idiot trio (Crusery, Shalba and Katerea) are elated by my power.</p><p>It shows them that their plans are way in towards fruition.</p><p>If some people fall unconscious or cannot stand in my presence because of it, then they were not worthy of standing in the presence of the young lord.</p><p>Bloody fuckers.</p><p>If the cost of letting the entire weight of my Haoshoku wasn’t death, I was sorely tempted to crush them all under the full brunt of it.</p><p>I sighed and woke up the servant. After all, he was the one guiding me to my destination today.</p><p>After four years of being taught the basics of reading and alphabets, which I aced easily due to my cheats, I was finally getting a chance to learn magic.</p><p>Yes, Magic!.</p><p>I mean sure I can already do that but I have never learned it formally. No one tries to teach me anything that is not decided by the idiot trio or Rizevim maybe.</p><p>There were no books regarding magic in detail in the house.</p><p>I doubt it was child safety. These people have a very strange idea about safety after all.</p><p>So it leads me to only one conclusion. I am being controlled. They are trying to control all the aspects of my learning to know what I can do so that if I turn against them, I can be put down very easily.</p><p>If I had to guess then it is the Conqueror’s Haki which had them….or rather Rizevim on edge.</p><p>The idiot trio are just that….idiots. Their jealousy is suppressed by the fact that I am made from the DNA of both Lucifer and Asmodeus.</p><p>Yes, artificially from the DNA of two Satans.</p><p>Not their descendants but THE Lucifer and THE Asmodeus themself.</p><p>These fuckers take the blood thing too seriously.</p><p>Well that aside, many things have happened in these four years.</p><p>I was taken by Razevan Lucifer….who was surprisingly a decent person. Well as decent a devil in this place can be.</p><p>The one who was the main source of all the pain was Rizevim.</p><p>He browbeat any shred of confidence out of Razevan. I personally think that he was told that he was useless so many times that he actually believed it. The imagination based magic can be a bitch sometimes. That subconscious change in body is not always advantageous.</p><p>That bastard didn’t drop his guard even a little against me.</p><p>Euclid did come over sometimes to check upon my physical condition and measure my demonic power.</p><p>My power has grown by almost double in the last four years.</p><p>The process will speed up when I become eight. Eight years is generally the age when a Devil child starts developing faster.</p><p>It is also an age where Clan Traits awaken.</p><p>That is not to say I haven’t been doing anything on my own.</p><p>I have been carrying on the process of breaking and repairing my muscles with demonic energy flow.</p><p>This counts as a use of magic too and magic like muscles can be grown through work.</p><p>This however is still inferior to the Zenkai or Enhancement drugs.</p><p>I however will have to find a way to keep my power in check.</p><p>It was because I have seen the amount of power Rizevim had.</p><p>It was almost impossible.</p><p>Ten times as strong as the original Lucifer.</p><p>I had thought that the original Lucifer was somehow as strong as Shalba or something.</p><p>That was completely wrong.</p><p>If my estimation is correct, a Satan Class devil is at the very least five times stronger than someone like Euclid.</p><p>A Super Devil was however a completely different story.</p><p>A Super Devil is ten times as strong as a Satan Class devil.</p><p>It was really humbling to know how weak I was.</p><p>I have estimated that currently Euclid is fifteen times stronger than me. A Satan will be five times that so seventy five times stronger than me.</p><p>A Super Devil however is….seven hundred and fifty times stronger than the current me.</p><p>Euclid was stronger than a normal ultimate class devil but then again apparently the original Satan Descendants especially Lucifer had immense demonic power. Four times more than normal.</p><p>Razevan who was considered an Ultimate Class devil was actually considered a waste of a Lucifer.</p><p>We also have to consider that power reserves don't translate to being strong.</p><p>It is like having giant chakra reserves. If one cannot use it properly, then it is meaningless.</p><p>But this barely matters to me….well in a good way at least. Either way they are stronger than me, enough to crush me with a thought.</p><p>What I need right now is a way to utilize my power.</p><p>I did try out some magic based on my imagination.</p><p>It was honestly too wasteful for my taste. That Dress Break was only viable at the upper levels because of the Boosted Gear. Without that, it would have been much easier to just rip armor off with my own hands considering the amount of demonic power that would be required for it.</p><p>A magic after making it needs to be refined over and over. The magic circle plays a major role in this as well.</p><p>This is one of the reasons that clan devils were so ahead of clanless devils. The simple magic circle increased their efficiency by several times.</p><p>For example a clanless devil has to use a hundred units of demonic power for let’s say a Dress Break. A clan devil can use a magic circle to do it in twenty.</p><p>This sheer difference on top of an already distinct genetic advantage is extremely hard to overcome. Even someone like Sairaorg had this genetic advantage despite not having any demonic power.</p><p>This is also the reason why Ajuka Beelzebub(Astaroth) was so feared. It was because he could use almost 99.99% of his demonic power.</p><p>He could use a tenth of the Demonic power of Sirzechs to do the same work.</p><p>Goes to show how much of a monster Sirzechs must be to be considered the Strongest Devil.</p><p>That said, Rizevim was by no means weak. I doubt he was even at the level of Sirzechs. There is a reason why Sirzechs’ peerage doesn’t have any Sacred Gear users after all.</p><p>They are specifically chosen to fight off against the man who can render all Sacred Gears completely useless.</p><p>And, right now, I am stuck between these monsters….I am not even considering the likes of Ophis and Great Red now.</p><p>It is now that I truly comprehend the importance of a Longinus.</p><p>The Biblical God was like a cheatbook.</p><p>I could just imagine the amount of work I will need to surpass these people. Assuming that all the shit starts when it does(which already seems unlikely, damn butterflies), I have something around from a decade to fifteen years to reach the mark.</p><p>I asked Razevan and the idiot trio for a magic circle but apparently it was decided that I will be getting the Lucifer Magic circle and that I will only be allowed that when I start my formal magic education.</p><p>I did try to analyze it using my Archmage and cut off some of my power waste but I soon had to give up my training when I realized that….I was being watched.</p><p>Every fucking second of it, I was being watched.</p><p>Euclid started visiting me a lot during that period, which was three months ago. I promptly gave up the training with the excuse of it being boring.</p><p>Children are quite unpredictable. Deal with it.</p><p>If it was not clear to anyone then I would like to restate it. I am basically their weapon. When I said I was like Naruto here, I was not kidding.</p><p>Our situation is the same in more than one way.</p><p>Although the presence of the three idiots keeps anyone from bullying me.</p><p>“This is where your teacher is waiting, young lord. Another student will be joining the lessons with you today. She is two years older than you but very talented.” The servant Fredrick who brought me to the room added.</p><p>I nodded in reply.</p><p>Apparently I have to act as if I have a stick up my ass.</p><p>“I apologize for delaying you and taking your time young lord.” He bowed once more.</p><p>“Very well. Leave now. I need to attend the class.”</p><p>Oh and speak like a douche as well.</p><p>So I basically had to act like a silver haired Uchiha.</p><p>“Thank you very much Young Lord.”</p><p>“Hn.”</p><p>I entered the room thinking about the one who will be joining me today. Knowing the idiot trio, it is doubtful that they will allow someone normal to get anywhere near me. Then again knowing Rizevim, it could very well be someone to keep an eye on me.</p><p>The room was quite spacious facing the garden.</p><p>Inside the room there were three people. Razevan, another middle aged man, Observation Haki shows that he is at least as strong as Razevan too, an ultimate class devil and the final one, a young silver haired, red eyed girl.</p><p>She has no human part to her so she is a pure blooded devil too or rather a full devil.</p><p>Pure blooded devils are more of a symbolic thing rather than biological.</p><p>Only those born from both parents from the Satan families, 72 Pillars and Extra Demons can be called pure blooded devils.</p><p>Others are called natural born devils or full blooded devils. They are all different things.</p><p>“Come in Damien. Come take a seat.” Razevan beckoned me.</p><p>I bowed slightly to him. It was more of a nod and less of a bow but he is someone who is content with that.</p><p>“He is your teacher for magic and combat arts. His name is Gregory Bune.” The man bowed to me. “The other child is your companion who will be studying magic with you. Introduce yourself girl.” Razevan spoke to the girl then.</p><p>“Greetings Young Lord. My name is Gretel Lucifuge. I am honored to study magic with you.” The girl spoke in a slightly shy yet stoic tone of voice.</p><p>I however had to do a double take inside my head.</p><p>Lucifuge?</p><p>I had no idea that there were other Lucifuges alive.</p><p>“You wouldn’t happen to be related to Euclid would you?” I asked and my now sharper senses observed a twitch of fear run across her eyes but she schooled her expression quickly and answered me. “I am his younger sister, my Lord.”</p><p>….huh?</p><p>Euclid had a younger sister?</p><p>I looked towards Razevan. His expression was a little complicated.</p><p>“I thought Euclid’s parents had passed away during the Great War and the Civil War? Adopted?” I asked a little curious.</p><p>“Her mother survived the Civil War and was taken in because she covered for Grayfia Lucifuge which helped her betray the true Satans. She was then used to give birth to other Lucifuges as a punishment. The three boys before her couldn’t stand the enhancement process and perished. Apart from you, she is the only one who withstood the Enhancement drug and process with five doses. This is why she was chosen to be your companion for this class.” Razevan explained in a plain voice while my head ran at the speed of a supersonic jet.</p><p>I observed her look of pain when her mother was mentioned, a look of anger at Grayfia’s name and then the rest was fear.</p><p>Observation Haki was extremely useful for observing emotions.</p><p>She was even afraid of me.</p><p>Given the extremes that these bastards go to, I can only assume what they did to her mother.</p><p>Give birth to other Lucifuges….what a fucking polite way to say that she was turned into a breeding stock.</p><p>“So half-sister.”</p><p>Razevan however shook his head. “No, Euclid himself conducted the experiments. He even used his own father’s genetic samples for the process. They are siblings in every sense of the word.”</p><p>I completely blanked my mind using Occlumency.</p><p>I had to do it to not let my Houshoku crush them all.</p><p>THAT FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT.</p><p>He did that himself?</p><p>If I remember correctly then he was obsessed with Grayfia.</p><p>Did he try to make a Grayfia of his own?</p><p>Did he kill off those three before her because they were boys?</p><p>I had to forcibly push down the urge to vomit at the very thought of it.</p><p>The girl herself was barely holding herself from crying. Her hands were clenched and her emotions were all over the place but even with her quivering lips, she still tried to maintain the stoic appearance.</p><p>Was she trying to be brave? Or was this another way for Euclid to mould her into a copy of Grayfia?</p><p>Thousands of thoughts ran through my mind and I kept pushing them out of my head.</p><p>I couldn’t even take a deep breath as that would show my emotional instability in such a situation. They will pounce on every weakness I show.</p><p>fuck Fuck FUCK <strong>FUCK!</strong></p><p>“It doesn’t matter what her mother or brother or sister did.” I spoke up and all three looked at me. “What matters is that she is with us.” I then looked towards the teacher and spoke, trying to ignore the look of surprise on the girl’s face. “I wish to start our lesson for today. Let us not waste any time.”</p><p>The teacher was a little flustered but still nodded back.</p><p>Razevan nodded and then asked me to raise my hand. He then put the mark of the Lucifer House on the back of my palm.</p><p>“Concentrate on the mark and try to invoke the magic circle.”</p><p>I did as was said and pushed my demonic power towards the mark and just like that a palm sized silver coloured magic circle lit up on my palm.</p><p>The feeling of power and control were not the prominent ones on my mind at that moment….It was the beauty of the magic circle.</p><p>The thing was beautiful.</p><p>It was the only thing I could think of.</p><p>“This is the mark of the Lucifer House, created by Lucifer himself. This is our mark as the rightful rulers of the Underworld. Use it with pride.” Razevan spoke and then strolled out of the room.</p><p>“In that case let us start our first lesson on Devil magic.” The teacher started teaching. “The foundation of Devil magic was created by Lucifer himself. The basics of this type of magic is image, desire and power.” He looked towards us as if asking if we understood. We nodded and he continued. “The first part is imagining something. Having a clear image in your mind. The clearer the image, the easier it is to cast the magic. The difference between a clear and unclear image can lead to anything between a failed spell to a hundred times the cost or even an accident that could kill the user. This step is the most important. Please remember this young lord.”</p><p>I nodded and observed that Gretel did it too.</p><p>The girl was supposed to be smart enough to be put beside me so this much was to be expected too.</p><p>“The second part is the Desire. To use magic, we have to desire it. The stronger our desire, or conviction in wanting to achieve the result, the easier we will achieve the magic. Desire and intent are the driving force behind the spell. A spell with just image and power can only result in so much. Let us take a simple fireball for example. We can imagine a perfect fireball and then add power to it to make it manifest too, but if we don’t intend to harm anyone with it, if we don’t desire for an intended result, the damage will always be held back by our own magic. Our demonic power is a part of ourselves, an extension of our own selves. If we don’t want to attack, it will always hold itself back. So desire is extremely important for a spell. In the case of the fireball spell, imagine the Image being the shape and creation of the fireball and power being the fuel that keeps it burning, then desire is the temperature and the force with which it is thrown. Did you understand that?”</p><p>I nodded again.</p><p>“The last part is the power. It is basically the fuel for the magic. The more power you add, the bigger the fire will be.”</p><p>I raised a hand and asked the question that had been on my mind for a while. I wanted to verify if what I knew about Magic circles is true.</p><p>“Why do we use magic circles if we can use magic without them?”</p><p>The teacher smiled and answered, “A good question young lord. A magic circle is primarily used as a focus. It has other uses as well but we will come to that later. Let’s say that a clanless devil has to use a magic spell, a fireball for example. He will have to imagine the spell, desire and then use his own power to create the spell. Supposedly he takes 100 units of energy for it. If he creates a magic circle however, it can be programmed to reduce the consumption of the spell by taking many factors like the flow of power, unnecessary uses, extra wastes and other such factors and cutting them out. If such a circle can be used, the clanless devil can, let's assume, do the same magic with 80 units of energy and thus prevent a 20% loss of power. Are we clear till here?”</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>“The Clans however have specialized magic circles for themselves. These circles have been refined over millennia and unnecessary uses are cut off. It is like polishing a sword or a diamond, scraping off unnecessary materials for the best results. The family sigils that are used to mark someone’s hand contains the family’s original Magic circle. This can be used by simply pushing their magic into it. There are differences between the ones used by the family and the servants. The sigil is also used to protect the magic circle itself as the code itself is safe inside the sigil. It works like a machine where you enter the power and get the results and know nothing of what and why it happened. The original magic circle is only passed down to the Heir or Heiress when they take over the House as it’s one of the family’s most guarded secrets. I am proud to say that my own House Bune’s Magic circle can conserve 68% power.” He sounded very proud of it.</p><p> I wonder how much this magic circle conserves.</p><p>“I assume that there are safeguards regarding the runaway servants as well?”</p><p>He smiled, “There are. Most of the traitors remove the mark and then run because if not then they can be tracked back or a kill switch can be activated in it. The fools in the underworld don’t use the kill switch part right now because of the reincarnated monstrosities they are defiling our noble race with, something about causing unrest. No wonder there are so many strays roaming around.”</p><p>I felt a sudden chill down my spine. I wonder which one I have. I need to learn of a way to remove the sigil and the mark soon.</p><p>Fucking shit. They put a curse mark on me and I didn’t even realize it?</p><p>“Hahahaha don’t look at it like that young lord. The Heirs and family members don’t have a kill switch in their marks. This is especially true for the Satan Clans. The Satan Clans have servants from the Extra demon clans. They all have their personal magic circles. The Lucifer clan has servant clans of Lucifuge, Satanachia, Agaliarept, Fleurety, Sargatanas and Nebrios. Each Lucifer has their own aide from the Lucifuge Clan when they come of age.” He said that while looking at Gretel.</p><p>The girl seemed to shrink under the gaze.</p><p>I change the topic again to avoid her being under scrutiny.</p><p>Right now, anything would be better than the thought of Euclid and his depravity.</p><p>“What other uses do the Magic circles have?”</p><p>“Hmm. They can be used to store any spells that the user has created or mastered. These spells can then be called at a moment’s notice. The Magic circles have a function to identify and store the most efficient use of the magic. So you don’t have to actively keep on trying to bring the best spell for recording. It keeps improving as long as you train.”</p><p>That is absolutely genius, though it raised another question.</p><p>“Then can’t someone older simply store a magic in the magic circle for the children to use?”</p><p>“Hahahaha if only it could be so easy. Every devil is different young master. magic involves the thoughts, imagination, desires, willpower and even the instinct of a person casting it. You can replicate the spell but you cannot replicate all these factors. Take for example a 100ml glass that has 50ml water in it. For some, it will be half full but for others it will be half empty. Everyone has a different thought process so simply copying a spell into the magic circle doesn’t work.”</p><p>It is like platform dependent programming languages in computers.</p><p>The only exception is that no one can create a Byte Code because there are too many variables to manipulate and the language is too complex.</p><p>“Can control over demonic power be improved so that we can avoid wasting energy?” I asked again and the teacher thought for a moment.</p><p>“It can be done. It is extremely hard though. demonic power is extremely chaotic by nature and to control it is even harder. It is hundreds of times easier to just create a magic circle that will waste 20% less energy than controlling our demonic power to do the same.”</p><p>“But if we can do both at the same time, we can conserve 34% demonic power instead of just 20%.”</p><p>“True. Such things come with experience though. Anyways, you are a Lucifer young lord and also part Asmodeus. demonic power will never be an issue for you either way. By the time you are an adult, you will be a Satan Class at the very least. There will never be a necessity for you considering that all the Satan Houses have magic circles that conserve above 80% energy.”</p><p>Fucking lazyass.</p><p>The magic lesson went on for a few more hours.</p><p>Say what you will about them but these people don't skive with my training, provided they want me to learn something.</p><p>I did complete my basic education within four years. So it was more or less established that I am a genius.</p><p>“Then that is all for today young lord.” The teacher ended the class and then left us alone in the room.</p><p>I had to wait for the other servant to pick me up. Although I knew that he was waiting right outside the door, it is always my choice when I decide to leave. If I am needed anywhere I can always be called.</p><p>I turned my attention to the girl sitting beside me. She was suddenly a bit more tense but slowly loosened herself or rather pretended to be comfortable.</p><p>It’s like I am some sort of monster, well I am….kinda ….sorta….but still.</p><p>I mean I am not really bad looking.</p><p>I have silverfish white coloured hair and blue eyes. My hair colour is more on the white end than her darker shade. I have my haughty emo look practiced to perfection in my bathtub while looking at my reflection.</p><p>If anything I looked even cuter, like a cute Killua.</p><p>Hell, I even have a psychopathic family like Killua.</p><p>Anyways I think she is too afraid of me eating her, something I would think of if she was at least a decade older.</p><p>“Umm, so what do you do in your free time?” I asked, trying to start a conversation.</p><p>Pretending to be a kid is such a pain in the ass.</p><p>The only other kid I know is a joy….and three and a half years old.</p><p>I can act like an older person in front of her.</p><p>This however is a new situation.</p><p>“Eh…m-me?”</p><p>“Hn.”</p><p>On second thought, maybe acting like the emo Uchiha is not good to get along with an emotionally damaged and less confident girl like Gretel.</p><p>“Don’t worry I don’t eat people. I was thinking if you are free and want to, we can play together sometimes?”</p><p>“W-with me?” she stuttered and looked completely stunned.</p><p>“Hn.”</p><p>“B-but that would b-b-be impolite. I am from the Lucifuge house. W-w-we are servants of the L-l-lucifer House.”</p><p>It’s like talking to Hinata.</p><p>“In that case play with me if you have free time. This is an order.”</p><p>“O-o-order? That….o-kay.”</p><p>Ah, if I wasn’t sure that we were being watched right now, I would have hugged this girl and let her cry.</p><p>“Good.”</p><p>I want to see how much influence I really have. If all of this is just a hoax to send me into a sense of false security. I have seen the emotions of the idiot trio and even if Rizevim has plans for this. The idiot trio will no doubt push it if it is only due to Euclid even if it is just to show a servant his place.</p><p>Pride is a major part of their personalities.</p><p>I hope I can get her away from him and if possible attached to me.</p><p>If five doses of the Enhancement Drug is something to go by, she is supposed to have strong potential.</p><p>I have only marked one person with my Binder and I have five slots empty.</p><p>If she is really trustworthy, then I can get my other Binder slot in use too.</p><p>The room quieted down a little after that.</p><p>She didn’t speak anything but she did sneak a peek sometimes at me.</p><p>Not being able to stand the quiet for any longer, I spoke again.</p><p>“Want to play now?”</p><p>“Eh?”</p><p>“I mean it’s not like we are doing anything?”</p><p>“Eh ah o-kay.”</p><p>“We can play the Word Game. Do you know it?”</p><p>She shook her head sadly at this.</p><p>“I will teach you.”</p><p>And then I did teach her how to play the Word Game.</p><p>The girl despite her lack of confidence is very smart.</p><p>She did keep up with me but seemed reluctant to try to win.</p><p>It will take some work to change this. I need her to gain some confidence.</p><p><strong>- Scene Change –</strong></p><p>The servant apparently had enough after an hour and decided to knock.</p><p>I didn’t create any problems for him either.</p><p>I had more than enough time for starters with this adorable girl and now she needs her time to adjust to me.</p><p>I returned back to the residence of Razevan.</p><p>The man himself was not present. The one who was present was a woman in her mid-twenties with jet black hair and blue eyes with a baby in her lap as she tried to feed it.</p><p>“young lord, you are back.” She smiled at me and it honestly made me happy.</p><p>I don’t know what good deed Razevan had done to get someone like Aria. Aria Smith was a half British half German lady in her mid-twenties.</p><p>People might not recognize her by her name but she has another identity.</p><p>The identity given to her by her baby in her lap.</p><p>I went ahead and softly pinched the cheeks of the adorable ball of fluffiness which turned and pouted at me.</p><p>Vienna Lucifer….or the ones who was supposed to be Vali Lucifer.</p><p>I know this is exactly who she is and not someone else because I have checked the presence of an extremely powerful Sacred Gear inside her.</p><p>It was also one of the main reasons that a half devil like her was allowed to live here with her mother.</p><p>Although, I would have personally preferred if Aria had taken her somewhere and hidden her away. The bastard Rizevim has already started poking Razevan and while Aria would never show it, she had had marks on her body.</p><p>Marks from being hit.</p><p>Obviously Razevan held back. The man’s fault right now is being a coward with pride, not a heartless jerk. This might soon change however.</p><p>I do not have enough demonic power to just Bind him with Binder or I would have done that before he could become something irredeemable.</p><p>The child however has been bound by me so that even if she accidentally died, I would be able to bring her back.</p><p>Being a young girl will only make her troubles worse.</p><p>My presence might have caused worse butterflies than I could have expected.</p><p>“Umm, I am back.”</p><p>I smiled at the lady.</p><p>She patted my head. She only did this when no one was in the house except her, Vienna and me.</p><p>Shows of affection from a lowly human is seen as a weakness for someone like me.</p><p>Motherfuckers.</p><p>“How was the lesson? Did you have fun learning about magic?” she smiled gently at me.</p><p>“Umm. The lesson was nice. The teacher was….adequate.”</p><p>Her face twitched as she tried to control her smile.</p><p>“Obviously. For my genius young lord, teachers can only be…. adequate and nothing less is permissible?”</p><p>Oh her teasing while still maintaining the respectful tone.</p><p>“I also played the Word Game with a girl after class.” I said concentrating on Viennas soft cheeks.</p><p>“Oh. A girl you say? What is her name? Was she cute? Does the young lord have someone whom he likes?” her face took the look of a cat that caught a canary.</p><p>I deadpanned at her. I don’t know if kids my age can deadpan but I couldn’t care less at this moment.</p><p>She burst out in giggles at this.</p><p>Really. Women and their habit of gossip.</p><p>“Her name is Gretel Lucifuge. She is Euclid’s sister and studies magic with me. I invited her to play when she has free time.”</p><p>Apparently she knew about Gretel as her face took a hint of sadness which she pushed aside quickly and took a motherly look for me. “The young lord is very kind. I will be glad to make some cookies for you when she comes to play.” She said as she half hugged me, squishing me to Vienna who was trying to free her cheeks from between us.</p><p>“Chocolate cookies.” I added.</p><p>“Hmm. Chocolate cookies then.”</p><p>This woman is the closest thing I have to a mother in this world.</p><p>….and probably the only thing that has kept me sane in all this chaos.</p><p>I would have bound her too but I didn’t want to force her. Call it whatever shred of humanity I have from my previous life.</p><p>The logical part of my mind shouts at me for being a fool and not taking advantage of every resource I get but even then I firmly keep it at bay.</p><p>Maybe I am afraid.</p><p>To become like these….bastards, cruel, remorseless, unloving.</p><p>I mean what is even the use of becoming all powerful if I am left alone with a bunch of sex toys at the end of it all?.</p><p>The calm logical part of my head screams at the openings that I am leaving for her.</p><p>But really, can you blame me for being….just myself even if just a bit in front of someone.</p><p>I know that someone like Rizevim can and will use her against me if he finds out about our bond.</p><p>I don’t act like this with her if there is anyone except us in the room or even outside of this room.</p><p>This room is the only place where I don’t get the feeling of being stared at all the time.</p><p>The reason why I am not binding her even if I know that I can control her trust towards me, provide her the free will of her own is because despite of the domestic violence which would have landed Razevan in jail in any civil society(sI scoffed at my thought), she actually loved him.</p><p>Weird right?</p><p>Is this what they call love being blind?</p><p>Razevan had picked her up during his rebellious phase when he had gone off to the Human world.</p><p>She had no one and was about to be sold off as a prostitute.</p><p>The point was that the pimps or whoever it was picked a fight with Razevan who was a moody bastard right then and fair to say that he slaughtered everyone of them leaving only Aria alive.</p><p>I could take a guess that she then latched onto him and Razevan probably used her to ‘relieve’ himself.</p><p>If it was a twisted case of Stockholm Syndrome or if there was something else going on, I don’t really know.</p><p>Razevan kept her after that and she stayed as his servant\\stress relief after that.</p><p>Humans being kept as servants for the devils is not unknown.</p><p>Some part of me felt disgusted at this mockery of fate….but some part of me to my great disgust felt thankful because it is the only reason why I am sane right now.</p><p>I felt someone approaching the house and pulled away from her. She is a very smart woman.</p><p>“I will be in my room practicing my lessons. Please send something for me to eat.” I spoke stoically and she nodded with a smile.</p><p>A smile that held pain, helplessness and….acceptance.</p><p><strong>- Scene change –</strong></p><p>I laid on my bed as I thought of what I had learned today.</p><p>My mind running it through analysis with The Archmage Essence.</p><p>The theory that the teacher taught us today was no doubt the most basic of the basics.</p><p>I put my hand in front of me and imagined a ball of fire.</p><p>Only the fire, no general shape, no size, nothing.</p><p>Just that I needed a fire in front of my hand.</p><p>I felt my demonic power move and I didn’t do anything to change its flow either.</p><p>The result was a normal flame in front of my hand for a decent cost in demonic power.</p><p>The second try was to think of its shape and size, colour of the flame and heat.</p><p>The result was a fireball with much more stability and power and less than half the cost.</p><p>The effect of imagination was evident here.</p><p>The third try was to imagine the phenomenon. The fire igniting, imagining more oxygen being fed into it and containing it within the previous shape and size.</p><p>The colour of the fire changed and the heat increased a lot.</p><p>The cost decreased instead of increasing too. It gave me the conclusion that pinpointing the exact reason instead of just thinking about increasing the heat will avoid wastage of demonic power instead.</p><p>I can understand why Ajuka wastes so little demonic power.</p><p>I can hardly imagine any of these idiots studying basic sciences before doing magic. Only the scientific-type do so. And even fewer use that in their magic.</p><p>The reason is not because they are fools…..It’s because most of them are….lazy.</p><p>To consciously put thought and concentration on something as trivial as creating fire when they can just brute force through it because of their magic and not even put a noticeable dent in their power reserves is stupidity for them.</p><p>I however intend to make this a habit. An instinct as simple as breathing.</p><p>The Archmage Essence will help me with this.</p><p>I tried the same spell once more but this time while controlling my demonic power and guiding it towards the spell.</p><p>The result was faster invocation and decrease in the cost of the spell.</p><p>The last time I tried the final spell with my magic circle. The result was almost cheating.</p><p>It barely took 5% of the first spell’s demonic power cost but had almost 12 times the power.</p><p>So the efficiency changed by a factor of 240.</p><p>And this was for a simple fireball spell.</p><p>There are still improvements that can be done. The control of demonic power can be improved further, the theory behind the fire’s power can be changed and refined more.</p><p>I wonder if I can use atomic fissions and fusions as a theory for this spell. Not that I am going to try. A nuclear explosion to the face is not something I am willing to endure right now.</p><p>Maybe….when I am Ophis level strong then.</p><p>I closed my eyes and thought about my progress in the last four years.</p><p>How long do I have to stay here?</p><p>The fact is that I could escape if I really wanted but….they would easily find me.</p><p>Also, annoying as this place might be, they are willing to train me with knowledge that hardly anyone would use without any kind of a catch.</p><p>There is obviously a massive catch here too. That said jumping from a frying pan into the fire for no reason at all seems to be a bit stupid.</p><p>I plan to wait here for a while.</p><p>At least until Vienna is grown up. If Aria wishes to leave, then until that point….however unlikely that may be.</p><p>In these past few years, I have had to hold back my progress to keep them in an illusion about my full power.</p><p>Geniuses provoke feelings of admiration, monstrous geniuses however provoke fear and envy.</p><p>I have more than enough eyes on me as it is, I don’t want more.</p><p>That said I did take measures to cover up for these as soon as I am free.</p><p>The three things that I have been concentrating on right now are….Thought Acceleration, Parallel Processing and….the mother of all training cheats….the Shadow Clone Jutsu.</p><p>The Archmage core provides me with any kind of energy I want. There is no reason to waste that.</p><p>I haven’t used it properly though but just reverse engineering the theory is a pain in the neck and two.</p><p>Thought Acceleration and Parallel Processing on the other hand was easier.</p><p>The Astaroth House used these magics as a base of their spells.</p><p>Ajuka Beelzebub being the biggest example of the potential of these spells.</p><p>If I had to take a guess, I would say that the Monster had at least around 11 mind partitions.</p><p>Yes, 11 bloody partitions and that is a shoddy estimate from around over 400 years ago. 285,311,670,611 parallel processes.</p><p>A rough estimate considering the feats he has done in the civil war.</p><p>The fucking monster.</p><p>That said what is to say that he hasn’t improved again or even that it was the best he could do.</p><p>He had turned every spell cast by Tsufame Tereaku Leviathan, enough to submerge an entire city, those numerable weapons made from water and even her attacks from her True Leviathan’s ‘Sea Serpent of the End’ from with his calculation based magic, ‘Kankara Formula’.</p><p>The amount of calculations that would require is not something that my little mind can even fathom right now.</p><p>That is not to say that I am completely useless right now. I have a respectable 4 Partitions thanks to the cheat that my Archmage Essence is.</p><p>I have been trying to work on something completely different though.</p><p>Is it possible to make a part of my mind act on a different thought process? I haven’t been able to make any headway regarding it though. It is like looking towards the left and right at the same time and I am not fond of the idea of having a Shadow Clone inside my head.</p><p>I would have greatly appreciated a part of my head dedicated to controlling my Haoshoku Haki.</p><p>Well, I will try that when I get a lead somewhere.</p><p>The second was Thought Acceleration.</p><p>A 40 times normal speed after four years of work is quite nice considering I was mostly shooting in the dark.</p><p>Now that I have started my magical studies, I do hope I can get enough materials.</p><p>The advantage of these skills on my Occlumency is immense and I now have decent Occlumency Shields. Although how decent they are remains to be seen because I haven’t been mentally attacked yet.</p><p>I don’t even dare ask anyone about this. This is one of the main reasons that I want to reverse engineer the Shadow Clone Jutsu as soon as possible.</p><p>A Shadow Clone has an independent thought process and can attack my mental defenses while maintaining my secrets.</p><p>The cameras and surveillance spells in the room however are a major problem. I dread to think of what will happen if any of these bastards get a whiff of how to use a skill like the Shadow Clones. Although the lack of chakra will prevent them from easily deciphering it, it’s better to not discount the possibility of it.</p><p>That has ultimately led me to a final choice.</p><p>I must follow the footsteps of Aizen-sama.</p><p>Illusion Magic for the win.</p><p>I have to become so good at Illusions that even if I do the moonwalk on their dinner table, they will not be able to sense it.</p><p>This is easier said than done though.</p><p>demonic power is used to weave hologram like illusions. They are also used for communication circles so it is actually easily known.</p><p>The ones I am interested in however control the senses of the victim and that means working inside the victim’s mind.</p><p>Genjutsu is absolutely out if I use the Naruto method.</p><p>The Naruto world’s genjutsu acts after the user sends a thread of chakra into the victim and uses it to manipulate their chakra.</p><p>This thread of chakra can easily be broken if the chakra is pulsed. Obviously the higher the control over someone’s mind, the harder the victim finds it to break out of the Genjutsu.</p><p>This is however useless on a devil.</p><p>demonic power is naturally chaotic enough to break the thread if it is injected into the victim.</p><p>That completely cuts off the chakra method unless I can work it on Kotoamatsukami or Infinite Tsukuyomi levels.</p><p>That is however extremely hard….not impossible….but extremely hard to do without the cheating eyes.</p><p>I also have to find a way to study Illusion Magic without anyone knowing about it.</p><p>If they know I am interested in illusions, they will know what to expect.</p><p>The reason why Aizen-sama was so successful was because; no one knew what hit them until it did.</p><p>I have a basic plan on what to do but for now the most I can do is to wait and learn magic.</p><p>With that in mind I concentrated on using the fireball spell without my magic circle while trying to imitate the flow and movements of the demonic power as it was with a magic circle.</p><p>Time to ramp up my demonic power control.</p><p>I have no idea when I will have to throw away this Lucifer Magical circle. It is better if I start preparing myself for it early on.</p><p>Add magic circle creation to the list of things I need to learn.</p><p>And with that I started the mind numbing cycles of fireball creation.</p><p><strong>- Katerea Leviathan –</strong></p><p>“The Young Lord has started his magic studies and was assigned to Gregory Bune along with Gretel Lucifuge as a student.” The man reported.</p><p>“Very well. Keep reporting to me about his progress.”</p><p>The man left in the flash of a magic circle.</p><p>Katerea laid down on her bed after throwing aside her robes.</p><p>One of her hands crawled up towards her breasts and the other between her legs as she closed her eyes while her digits worked on her insides.</p><p>Her mind in a haze with thoughts about the adult form of the young lord, Damien Lucifer.</p><p>Katerea was easily over 500 years old and in all this time, if she had wanted, she could have easily bore a child to continue the Leviathan line.</p><p>She however didn’t do this.</p><p>Why?</p><p>The reason was extremely simple.</p><p>She didn’t find anyone worthy.</p><p>The other Satan descendants were the same as her. They were of the same station….but Katerea didn’t want that.</p><p>No, she will never be satisfied with something that simple.</p><p>She wanted more.</p><p>She wanted someone who surpasses all of them.</p><p>And due to the latest experiments, among five hundred and forty two subjects, one successful result. The Ultimate piece of art was born.</p><p>Damien Lucifer.</p><p>The one who defied all logic.</p><p>The one who will bring a new era to the devils. The true rulers of the devils….and this entire world.</p><p>Even after his birth, he had shown that he surpassed all the plebian devils and proved his superiority over all of them.</p><p>Two Hundred Doses of the Enhancement Drug.</p><p>The idiots administering the drug had no idea what that thing actually was….but she knew.</p><p>It was no simple medicine made from chemicals and herbs.</p><p>No.</p><p>It was beyond that.</p><p>The Enhancement Drug contained the Blood of the Original Satans.</p><p>The pure blood of the Original Satans if injected into any human will enhance their abilities to an extreme degree….obviously such lowly races will never be able to contain that blood and will wither away and die.</p><p>If injected inside a devil, they can withstand it better than a Human….but in the end the result is the same.</p><p>The blood of the original satans contains the traces of the birth of demonic power. It makes all the demonic power in normal devils boil in agitation in the presence of their rulers.</p><p>She had personally seen hundreds of devils die and wither away trying to gain a speck of power from that blood.</p><p>She did succeed obviously….but none went beyond three doses of the drug and even that one didn’t live long enough.</p><p>When Gretel Lucifuge had survived five drops, it was calculated that she would become satan class by adulthood.</p><p>It had made her envious beyond compare to think that <em>her</em>, the daughter of a traitor and the sister of another had gained such power from the blood of her ancestors.</p><p>The only assurance is that she will be trained to obey the True Satans and that Euclid will himself see to it that the training was able to calm her mind.</p><p>And then, two years later it happened.</p><p>The Project that was almost considered dead, the project to merge the DNA of two Satans to create a child had borne results.</p><p>A child had finally lived. <strong>[AN : The-Boy-Who-Lived LOL] [BN: - . -]</strong></p><p>The only success of Project Genesis and the only one who had the blood of not one but Two! Satans. That is the person who Katerea Leviathan wanted to be the father of her child.</p><p>Others couldn’t just match up.</p><p>Who else could withstand 200 doses of the Enhancement drug by the age of two?</p><p>It was as if the Enhancement Drug, the Blood of the Original Satans was a part of his own body.</p><p>The one who had caused problems in the experiments was due to his overenthusiasm and injected more than the prescribed enhancement drug into his body. The drug contained other chemicals other than the blood of the original Satans which in themselves are harmful to the body.</p><p>She had personally executed that man.</p><p>That said the Young Lord had survived.</p><p>Unsurprisingly if someone asked her.</p><p>And then he had released the burst of power that had knocked anyone not worthy of standing in his presence out.</p><p>A two year old child had knocked high and ultimate class devils out with their own power.</p><p>The sheer presence of the True King.</p><p>Oh she couldn’t wait for him to grow up.</p><p>Even Gretel Lucifuge had only been able to bear five doses by the age of four and she was predicted to become a Satan Class by adulthood.</p><p>Then what would Damien become?</p><p>She had no idea but she most definitely looked forward to it.</p><p>To the growth of Damien Lucifer, the future father of her child.</p><p>_________________________________x__________________________________________________________________x_________________________________</p><p><strong>Beta Reader: LuluViBritania(FF.N, SB and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th BritannianEmperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note :</strong></p><p><strong>This one took some more time than I had thought. I was working on my other fic.</strong></p><p><strong>Anyways, I tried something almost impossible in this chapter – ‘To Make Sense of The DxD Magic System’.</strong></p><p><strong>The DxD Magic System is something that was never really explored upon except that you have imagination based magic.</strong></p><p><strong>….</strong></p><p><strong>That in itself was a big piece of crap if you ask me.</strong></p><p><strong>I refuse to believe that all the devils were That! stupid that they couldn’t make anything out of this magic.</strong></p><p><strong>There had to be reasons for that.</strong></p><p><strong>I tried to throw in some of my thoughts. Please do tell me about them.</strong></p><p><strong>Damien’s growth had been stalled because he had to learn the normal childish stuff.</strong></p><p><strong>He couldn’t pretend to be a normal child because he sucked at that and might have slipped somewhere, so he didn’t even try.</strong></p><p><strong>The stoic child façade is something that works well with the people who see him as the ‘Young Lord’ and keeps the people who want him to behave as ‘Young Lord’….well satisfied at his behavior.</strong></p><p><strong>Also, yes.

    "content": "<p><strong>Disclaimer : I own nothing. (Seriously though, I wouldn’t be writing this if I did, duh)</strong></p><p>____________________________________________________________</p><p><strong>Chapter 1 : Awakening.</strong></p><p>Awakening in a different world might be a fantasy of many people, dreams of breathing fire and throwing meteors with fancy eyeballs or simply using swords to cut souls and stuff, it has always been the highest degree of allure among people….but believe me when I say that the feeling of truly being reborn is….surprisingly….normal.</p><p>It may have something to do with the fact that I still had my memories and cognizance from my previous life but even then it was quite <a href=\"https://normal….at\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">normal….at</a> least until I was put in an observation pod a few hours after my birth.</p><p>I do remember hearing what seemed like a woman’s cry, probably my mother but the baby senses were not doing me much favour at all.</p><p>I did feel the several needles shoved into my limbs quite well though and let me tell you….those damn things hurt like a bitch.</p><p>It would take me a few months to realize that I was in an observation pod. A baby body barely has enough energy. Apparently even my cheats can only do so much while my own body is not developed.</p><p>That brings us to the cheats, wishes or hax I got before being thrown….here.</p><p>It is the first thing all reincarnators and transmigrators think about right.</p><p>Well I got some of my own too.</p><p>Something that was <strong><em>supposed</em></strong> to make me OMG, TOO OP PLEASE NERF level strong.</p><p>I wonder if you saw that ‘supposed’ in the previous statement.</p><p>I use the word ‘suppose’ because the abilities were nerfed….brutally.</p><p>When I was offered a choice to throw a dice to decide how many Essences I could choose and I had gotten a six, I was overjoyed by it. The smile on that….DEVIL’s face was supposed to clue me in as to what I was up for.</p><p>Apparently my body and soul were not strong enough to bear the power of all those Essences and thus the power was reduced.</p><p>Well at least that was the explanation that I had gotten.</p><p>The fact that I was thrown into a random world and a random family, which judging from the Observation Pod somehow doesn’t fill my heart with joy, it also says a lot about the reincarnation itself.</p><p>I mean sure I was offered the customary cheats but if I don’t get to live past the moment I was born, what was even the point of that?.</p><p>If I had known that I was going to be caged like this, I would have chosen Essences to help me escape this situation rather than something to become OP and live a lazy life.</p><p>Well, so much for that.</p><p>The Essences that I had chosen were,</p><p>The Essence of the Binder</p><p>It had the power to bind anyone and make them as loyal to the binder as the user decides. The one who is bound can also bind others and this could give me a potentially infinite army under my beck and call. The bindings were also almost unbreakable until the one who is bound was ordered to kill themself or was basically too against the orders received. They were unalterable by anyone but me and were untraceable by anyone but me too. I could even revive anyone dead and bind them as long as I had their body, soul or even a very close belonging of the person and could repeat it an uncountable number of times since once bound, the souls become my property and I can summon them to me at will. It was a one way cheat to conquer almost any world with the least amount of work possible.</p><p>Instead,</p><p>What did I get?</p><p>The number of people I can bind has been reduced to one per year which will increase further as I age but still I can only bind people who are close to me or lower than me in power.</p><p>The other aspects of the power were thankfully almost untouched.</p><p>This made me almost useless as a newborn was not really strong and I didn’t even get the chance to touch anyone to bind them first.</p><p>Fucked from the very start.</p><p>The Second Essence that I had chosen was,</p><p>The Essence of the Broker.</p><p>It basically enabled me to make any deals I so wanted. They would be followed regardless. I just had to get the consent of the other party and they had to do so of their own free will while knowing the contents of the deal. I couldn’t just….let’s say Imperio them and make them do whatever I want.</p><p>The deals could be just about <em>anything</em>. From a simple pencil to a fucking sharingan, just about anything could be traded.</p><p>Pretty fucking broken right?</p><p>On the side note, beating someone up and making them sign something or accept a deal was considered fair as it was done of their own free will.</p><p>The free will here was debatable but according to the ‘DEVIL’ (I refuse to call him anything else), even if beaten up, someone could always choose to deny it. The simple fact that they had chosen not to do so shows that it was their free will.</p><p>Well, who am I to say anything else? It is, after all, to my own advantage.</p><p>This however was useless again as….I needed to be able to talk or write to make a deal.</p><p>Well fuck it all.</p><p>The third Essence was,</p><p>The Essence of the Archmage.</p><p>It was supposed to make me a cheat class magician like Solomon or something. A power generator or sorts which could make any type of energy I wanted, mana, spiritual power, chakra, ki, etc….you name it and it made it. I was to start with enough power levels that would let me throw around high level spells for hours before I became somewhat tired.</p><p>Super intelligence and the ability to make as well as analyze and re-create any magic was also included too.</p><p>Instead, my powers were highly suppressed due to my body not being able to bear the brunt of it.</p><p>I couldn’t cast anything right now though as I still had to theorize the spells or simply learn how they worked.</p><p>The fourth Essence was,</p><p>The Essence of the Mad Doctor.</p><p>It basically made me a mad scientist and was honestly something that I was counting on the most.</p><p>It also gave me the knowledge of alchemical and medical lores with the ability to make potions to do practically anything. And by anything I mean literally anything.</p><p>Immortality, Regeneration, you name it and it had it.</p><p>The biggest cheat about this however was the ability to spawn the ingredients for the potions or anything involving the Essence.</p><p>It also had the immunity to most diseases and poisons.</p><p>This again was nerfed and almost fucked out the window.</p><p>The ability to spawn ingredients was scaled now according to my mana....which was honestly not much.</p><p>The fifth Essence and the one which I was probably counting on to survive whatever this is was,</p><p>The Essence of the King.</p><p>It gave me infinite stamina and will power.</p><p>Or rather was supposed to.</p><p>Instead it is currently changing my body and I would probably have inhuman amounts of it when I reach adulthood.</p><p>Fat good that did for me right now though.</p><p>Along with it, it also gave me pain immunity, which I can positively say hadn’t taken hold yet because those motherfucking needles hurt my butt.</p><p>Then there was peak human physique and inhuman amounts of charisma.</p><p>But again Peak Human baby was….still a baby and I don’t think my charisma as a baby was helping me so much right now.</p><p>The part I was counting on however was the ability to create a bloodline that this Essence gave me within reason of course.</p><p>I went all meta on it and chose a mix of Heracles’ bloodline that allowed him seven lives, A Saiyan’s Zenkai and super regeneration.</p><p>It was fair to say that it was not accepted.</p><p>Instead I got an extra life for every year I live till I have seven. If I died, the extra life will however be regenerated in one year and without immunity to whatever killed me. I did get a nerfed version of the Saiyan Zenkai too but no regeneration however. I did bargain in the fact that my blood couldn’t be used by anyone else without my permission. No stealing Daddy’s bloodline. Fuck you Danzo, Orochimaru and people like that. I am not sharing the sweet sweet bloodline I have with anyone until I want to myself.</p><p>The last Essence was,</p><p>The Essence of the Blank.</p><p>This one however was not nerfed at all, not that it mattered at all.</p><p>This one didn’t give me any super special power or anything. It just removed all limits from me.</p><p>I can learn and do things even if I should not be able to do it without let’s say a bloodline.</p><p>For example, I could use the Ice Bloodline even if I didn’t belong to the Yuki Clan in the Naruto world.</p><p>This however came with the clause that I had to work my ass off for it though.</p><p>I will be able to develop my abilities to unnatural degrees and will not be stopped by anything due to incompatibility either.</p><p>None of the not enough potential or sorry not born of the bloodline crap though.</p><p>So I, ‘Insert my name here’ (Because I don’t know my name yet) with all my cheats was now shut inside an observation pod, trying to think of what and why as well as planning my eventual breakout and then maybe conquer the world if I was motivated enough by then.</p><p>Well, I could have lived with it if that ‘DEVIL’ bastard hadn’t thrown me into a random world because it took my world choosing privileges as compensation for saving my life.</p><p>I mean what the fuck dude, I was offered the chance to roll the dice fair and square. How is it my fault that your products had problems? If it was so, I should have been informed at the very start.</p><p>The bastard then had the audacity to tell me that I could have chosen to bring the Essences with me and not just drink everything at once.</p><p>Well then, next time write it in a bloody manual.</p><p>And this is the brief story of how I am currently floating in an Observation Pod whose greenish liquid hurts my eyes if I try to keep them open for long.</p><p><strong>- Time Skip –</strong></p><p>Two years have passed.</p><p>How did I know?</p><p>I honestly wish I could say that I counted the seconds and despite how cool that would have been, I did no such thing.</p><p>Yeah, fuck you Senku.</p><p>I had more than enough on my plate to count as it is.</p><p>The experiments done on me, whatever it is that was injected into my body and the reactions it had on me.</p><p>Honestly I think that without the Mad Doctor Essence, I would be dead meat. I could hypothesize a few things about what was injected inside my bloodstream but without actually conducting any experiments, I couldn’t say for certain. Anyways, what I could say for certain was that Mad Doctor saved me.</p><p>I am pretty sure that the medicines that were pumped into me would have poisoned even adults let alone a newborn.</p><p>I would have been dead meat already if I didn’t have the immunity to all the poisons.</p><p>I didn’t know if it was the immunity to poisons or something else that they had discovered which led them to increase the dosage on me.</p><p>That is not to say that I haven’t done anything in these past two years at all.</p><p>I have been concentrating on my body with Archmage and found that even outside of my inbuilt power generator my body had some sort of energy. It was violent and chaotic and extremely hard to control.</p><p>It was decently high in amount as well….but then again I didn’t have anything to compare to so I was completely lost.</p><p>What I needed before anything else was to first figure out where I was.</p><p>Sounds pretty simple right?</p><p>Well, there was a small problem….I was still stuck inside of the same Observation Pod.</p><p>Well there was however a ray of hope because now that it has been two years, I had two extra lives.</p><p>These two years had been the worst thing that I have experienced and as I had stated it, the essence of the King did help me live through it because the pain resistance was increasing and the infinite willpower was apparently a thing because I can still think about these things which means I haven’t broken down yet.</p><p>Any man would be rendered half mad if stuck inside a child’s body without any kind of extra help and that is assuming that the child gets proper care and even has other people around them to keep them company.</p><p>Humans are social beings. One can only stand being alone for so long without breaking down.</p><p>The fanfics and anime that show the MC being a badass motherfucker and practicing chakra control right out of their mother’s wombs without any kind of support….are big fat liars.</p><p>This is where the Essence of the King helped me because of the infinite willpower, it prevented me from losing hold of my sanity and helped me focus on what I wanted to do.</p><p>So, what is it that I wanted to do?</p><p>What I wanted to do was try out a hand on my Essence of the Archmage.</p><p>This ability allowed me to theorize any fictional ability with enough time and recreate it.</p><p>So I did just that.</p><p>I need information and to do that I needed to hear, see and listen well basically….<em>observe</em> my surroundings.</p><p>Remembering Rayleigh’s teachings about Observation Haki.</p><p>Close my eyes, already closed and concentrate on the surroundings.</p><p>The fact that I had no one to hit me and that the Observation Pod was supposedly soundproof was also a barrier but I somehow got past it.</p><p>I concentrated on my own heartbeat, the sound of the medicines and food being injected into me, the sound of air that I breathed which hit the oxygen mask on my face, the movement of the hair on my head when the air bubbles that sometimes appeared in the liquid made contact with me.</p><p>The air bubbles that hit my body and burst were a major part of my training.</p><p>Well, I am proud to say that it only took me two weeks (I based it on the fact that they injected me with food four times a day) to sense when a bubble would hit me next.</p><p>This however was insanely hard to grind.</p><p>Observation Haki did work on the principle of making the sense hyper sensitive and forcibly awakening the sixth sense, at least that is what I had theorized.</p><p>I needed around another seven months to sense anything outside of my Observation Pod.</p><p>The world appeared like it was through heat vision….only that this one had many more colours to it.</p><p>I observed that my own body had a reddish black coloured energy. The same was present in the few that came around my observation pod sometimes.</p><p>The height would make them adults, that said I do hope that they didn’t just let children play doctor on me. The amount of reddish black energy they had however differed for everyone.</p><p>I am assuming that the reddish black energy is some kind of a magical power like mana or chakra maybe.</p><p>The few that came around me had several times my own energy. I am pretty confident that if I use the energy from my power generator, then I can overcome them in a few years of natural growth.</p><p>This thought however went out of the window very soon.</p><p>It was the day that I had observed an energy source around a hundred times my own.</p><p>I pulled back my observation haki almost on instinct so as to not catch the attention of the ‘being’ that was around me.</p><p>It was like I was doused with a bucket of cold water which made me rethink my plans for the future.</p><p>Was that monster really the strongest one here?</p><p>My Observation Haki was not strong enough to get the definite shape of people to high contrast. I couldn’t read their lips and that would be assuming that I knew what language they were talking in at all.</p><p>I sure as hell didn’t want the attention….well even more attention of this being on me if it were to catch a wisp of my Observation Haki.</p><p>The information gathering mission suddenly became a lot harder.</p><p>It took me almost all of my waking hours of five more months of work to extend the range to an almost 10 meter radius around me.</p><p>The change in colours showed the change in emotions. If someone was feeling sad, the aura around them changed to a different colour.</p><p>I did push my luck with the lower powered beings that approached my observation pod and soon found out that they didn’t realize what was happening.</p><p>It took me a while to theorize that Observation Haki worked by super enhancing my senses to a ridiculous degree and using it to forcibly drive my sixth sense into a hyper sensitive mode. That was how the future sight ability activated.</p><p>Different people have different makeups as their personalities and bodies were different and that is why the advanced version of the Observation Haki manifested in different ways among people.</p><p>I could see the auras of people. The brightness and size of the aura represents the strength and quality of power they have. The colour of the aura around the person represented the emotions felt by them as well as the type of energy they might hold inside them.</p><p>It must be made clear that the aura of a person and the energy they held inside them were completely different things.</p><p>I could understand how they felt and this made my chance of gathering information much easier too.</p><p>However, it was also at that moment that I realized a very major problem.</p><p>I myself couldn’t control my emotions.</p><p>I am sure that they are monitoring my heart rate and all the vitals. A severe chill ran down my spine when I realized that the being who had visited me might have noticed my nervousness in its presence. I didn’t want anymore (If that was even possible) attention towards me.</p><p>What if they just extract whatever information I had in my mind and then mind-wiped me into a drone?</p><p>That thought alone chilled me to the bones. I should have taken a mind protection Essence dammit.</p><p>What should I do?. The fuck should I do?</p><p>….</p><p>….</p><p>….</p><p>….</p><p>It took me an entire day of thinking to decide the next course of action.</p><p>I needed to learn Occlumency.</p><p>The thing that was quite vague in the Harry Potter universe yet entire volumes of books were spent hinged on that same field of magic.</p><p>It didn’t just protect one’s mind, something that I desperately needed right now, but it also helped to control one’s emotion quite well.</p><p>I needed both these things for myself.</p><p>And thus started my long journey to theorize Occlumency and recalling everything I did about it from everything I had read and using my Archmage Essence to juice out any sense from it. This however took a lot of work.</p><p>I remembered that we needed to clear our minds before anything.</p><p>This part was hard….much harder than I had thought it would be for me because I had nothing to do but float inside an observation pod.</p><p>My brain was working too fast and a super intelligent brain is not always a boon, especially when it can calculate several thousands of things that could go wrong at any given instant during my experiments.</p><p>The fear of the unknown is something that is extremely hard to ignore and being shut inside of a fucking observation pod didn’t do wonders for a mind.</p><p>It took me a whole month this time around to attain any progress.</p><p>What was the progress that I attained?</p><p>I learned to empty my mind.</p><p>But apparently to make Occlumency shields, I needed to have my defenses attacked which are quite hard right now. I’d rather no one ever tried to look inside my mind.</p><p>How do I even put up any defense?</p><p>Where do I put up any defense?</p><p>Believe me when I say that the MCs in those fanfics who can do all this right out of their mother’s wombs….are all fucking liars. It doesn’t work like that.</p><p>Even with my cheat skill Archmage Essence, it doesn’t work like that.</p><p>It may be because of the nerfs but it still wouldn’t be easy.</p><p>I tried to theorize anything I could but how do I create a dish if I only know its name and that it is supposed to taste sweet.</p><p>It is just not possible.</p><p>There are literally an uncountable number of trials and errors that I could make.</p><p>If I had an example of any of my thoughts being dragged out, I could have understood, I could have felt how and what to protect.</p><p>What to do to prevent that part from happening.</p><p>Now however I had no clue how to work this out.</p><p>So I tried to work with something else.</p><p>I grinded something that I already knew.</p><p><em>As Bruce Lee had once said, “I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.”</em></p><p><em>Bruce Lee, bro, I seriously hope you were not just pulling my leg with this or I am more or less screwed.</em></p><p>I repeated the process where I could empty my mind, repeatedly. It started off as repeatedly thinking of different things completely unrelated to each other so that my thoughts couldn’t be tracked.</p><p>This changed in about two months where the speed of changing my thoughts increased by a lot.</p><p>When you don’t have anything to do but concentrate on one work, infinite willpower and the Essence of the Blank, things mix up to become pretty fucking broken.</p><p>Throwing my thoughts away constantly did give me a pretty insane control over my mind.</p><p>Now I know that there was another method of bombarding someone’s mind with random thoughts and I could have tried.</p><p>It would honestly have been much easier.</p><p>Then again it was not an assured method either. I could overwhelm a human’s mind with a hundred thoughts per second but….whatever these monsters are outside my observation pod are not humans….or they are not normal humans. Who knows if it will be enough to overwhelm them?</p><p>But there was a thought that stopped me from doing it altogether.</p><p>Supposed I could bombard them with random thoughts….the question still stands about….from where and how I did I manage to have those memories.</p><p>That would put me on the top of the list right off the bat.</p><p>That was a big no.</p><p>The second was….I didn’t know where I was exactly.</p><p>On the off chance that I bombed someone with the memories of this world, I could probably screw everything up too.</p><p>….I know that the chances of me having the memories of this world is astronomically low….but it doesn’t change the fact that the possibility does exist.</p><p>Sure I could try changing thoughts with endless expanses of single colours, for example first white then black then yellow and so on and so forth.</p><p>That however had its own problems.</p><p>Last but not the least, running through all those memories increases my heartbeat and vitals. I don’t have control over my body and with all these instruments attached to my body, I am not risking anything towards me at all. So this plan was thrown right out of the window.</p><p>What? You thought this was easy? Well fuck no.</p><p>So I went off to my ten thousand kicks….ahem, I mean the practice of clearing my mind.</p><p>Five more months and I noticed a qualitative change in myself.</p><p>The control that I had over my thoughts gave an extreme boost to my control over the strange power in my body. I could move it much easier now.</p><p>Previously this had been quite hard to do because the energy was very chaotic.</p><p>Sure it worked how I said but….how do I say this.</p><p>If I had to use an example then I would say that previously it was like a bunch of sheep being led by a shepherd, that is to say it moved but it wandered around a lot and I had to work extra hard to keep it in line whereas now it moves like trained dogs. The effort needed to control it was very easy.</p><p>And that led me to the next part of my training.</p><p>The strange power that I had inside me, it was increasing with time but it was not being used for anything.</p><p>I didn’t dare use my internal power generator to produce different types of energies to compare it with my own power.</p><p>Observation Pod and all.</p><p>You would be surprised how limited your options become when you are one wrong step away from being dissected by who knows what.</p><p>That last but absolutely not the least advantage that I gained was my control over my thoughts. I could make my mind go blank with just a thought. That also brought along with it an extreme awareness of my own mind.</p><p>Now awareness was an essential part of my only other skill.</p><p>Observation Haki was jump kicked to a higher level. I could now feel everything in a fifty meter radius around me.</p><p>The images that were transferred to my brain also changed a little as they now held much more contrast compared to what it was previously.</p><p>Still not enough to observe their lip movements but enough to make a human shape clearly. It was an honest to goodness upgrade over watching humanoid blobs of light running around.</p><p>I also discovered something interesting.</p><p>The medicines that were pumped inside my body actually had more effects than I had previously thought.</p><p>It actually increased the strange energy in my body every time it was injected.</p><p>I kept a close eye on my energy’s growth.</p><p>That specific drug was injected inside my body at an interval of two weeks. Over the period of the next three months I noticed the pattern.</p><p>Every time the drug was injected inside my body, I felt slight pain (despite my increasing pain resistance from the Essence of the King) and then the strange power inside of me became even more chaotic. It broke my muscles if the pain I felt in my body was any indication.</p><p>This process continued for two whole days until the chaotic energy in my body was suppressed or rather accommodated by my body and then after it calmed down a little, that same energy started to heal my muscles over time.</p><p>I did notice that the calmer the energy, the faster the healing was. Also the more it moved inside my body (which it normally didn’t), the faster the healing was.</p><p>The power did settle down a bit but every time after it did, there was a distinct increase in the amount of that strange energy inside of my body.</p><p>It brought both relief and an urgent fear inside of me.</p><p>Whoever these people were, they were making a weapon.</p><p>This world was obviously not a peaceful one if they had to raise newborns in observation pods and artificially increase their power levels.</p><p>I really hoped it was not the DragonBall Z verse and the planet was destroyed by Beerus because he burned his tongue with tea.</p><p>What? I had too much time.</p><p>An empty mind is the Devil’s workshop.</p><p>And the only Devil I have known was not a pleasant person.</p><p>The good thing however was that the chance of them simply killing me off was reduced considering I lived through their ridiculous experiments.</p><p>In the last two months the dosage increased because I had figured out how to stop the pain and assimilate the drug inside my body faster. With my increased control over my powers, I could simply guide my power to my muscles and increase the rate of my own healing.</p><p>The motherfuckers must have realized it as they increased the dosage to once a week instead of once every two weeks.</p><p>That pushed me to the limit. I mean even if I could heal faster than before there was still a limit to how much I could stand.</p><p>I however didn’t increase my healing rate any further.</p><p>The bastards however didn’t hold off. I don’t know what kind of sadistic feeling they were attaining from this but after four weeks of no results, they dozed me with twice the amount of the drug than normal.</p><p>It should have been somewhat manageable but when my body started assimilating and adapting to it, another dose was added.</p><p>This was apparently too much for my body and for the first time since I was born in this world, I blacked out completely.</p><p>The Observation Haki dimmed down until I couldn’t see anything and all my senses started faltering as well.</p><p>I did try to use that strange energy and even used some from my power generator but the healing effect couldn’t keep up.</p><p>I did notice that the bastards around my observation pod were suddenly in a flurry rushing around like headless chickens near every machine they could to figure out what was happening.</p><p>It was only when I observed it further I found out that this drug was different.</p><p>Much more powerful than the previous one.</p><p>I once again felt that familiar blackness and for the second time in my life….I died.</p><p><strong>- Time Skip –</strong></p><p>I do not know how long I took to come back to life. This was after all the first time I died after being reborn with my cheats so I had no way of knowing.</p><p>The sudden sense of dread washed over me as I realized that I was screwed now because they would leave it at nothing to dissect me and find out the reason for my revival.</p><p>I hurriedly checked my vitals. Occlumency working overtime to push out all the stray thoughts and Observation Haki checked the state of my body.</p><p>I realized that my overall power had grown by almost twice.</p><p>I could attribute this to the drug as well as my nerfed Zenkai.</p><p>This growth was enormous compared to what I have had till now.</p><p>Still, was it worth it?</p><p>I died because of this.</p><p>If I didn’t have that Essence, I WOULD have died for real.</p><p>What is to say that they will not repeat this again just to get this result once more?</p><p>Among all of these worried thoughts, I didn’t realize a new fact for a while….I could hear again.</p><p>The realization hit me like a truck as I hurriedly pushed my Observation Haki outside my body and towards the surrounding and I for the first time in two years….cried.</p><p>I cried like a baby.</p><p>I hadn’t realized in my previous life that hearing sounds could be this good?</p><p>To hear my own voice felt like a blessing.</p><p>My throat was parched and my voice a little unnatural due to almost no use since my birth but my body was still well maintained due to the Essence of the King and the strange energy inside my body continuously healing any damage that I might have had.</p><p>The sound alerted all the people observing me.</p><p>The flurries of shouts and orders were shot around but I could care less.</p><p>The voice which would have been annoying to the almost unused ears of mine now sounded like music.</p><p>It is true that we don’t know the value of something until we have lost it.</p><p>The ability to hear something was so common that we almost always neglected it or took it for granted.</p><p>“It cried. The subject gave a signal. Hurry send a word to the Head. We need assistance. The purging of the drug was successful. Give me the vitals.”</p><p>“Blood Pressure, Normal. Heart Rate, a little above normal, attributed to first sensory contact in two years. No atrophy in muscles detected. The subject has a higher than average regeneration. The energy levels have stabilized to two and a quarter times the level prior to the drug injection. The vitals are all normal except for minor signs of stress and hysteria.”</p><p>“Obviously he will have stress.  The kid almost died. We had listed its vitals for around a whole minute before we could resuscitate him. I would be worried if he didn’t have signs of stress and hysteria.”</p><p>“The boss had killed off almost everyone in the team who were involved in the increase in the drug dose. They were under orders to report about the increased adaptation to the drug but they pushed it too far.”</p><p>“It was for the sake of results. This child can be what we need to throw those fakes out and reclaim what rightfully belongs to us. Those bastards almost messed this chance up. This was the only specimen that survived the correct genetic recombination. Every other subject died. The value that he has is beyond anything we can imagine.”</p><p> “I agree. They got what they deserved. I would have tortured them more before killing them.”</p><p>Okay…. I could understand their language.</p><p>The things that I heard are giving me mixed feelings.</p><p>The fact that the fucking cunts that killed me are dead makes me happy but at the same time the talks about taking down the so called fakes is giving me a bad feeling.</p><p>It seems like they are trying to overthrow a government or some kind of coup d’état and are planning to use me as some kind of super weapon.</p><p>Okay again not a heartening thought but still something that can be used to my advantage.</p><p>If they want to use me as a weapon it will mean that they will have to train me.</p><p>It will give me a chance to learn….but more importantly interact with someone.</p><p>The thoughts did soothe my heart to a great deal as I stopped crying.</p><p>The fact that I was feeling hungry might have been another reason.</p><p><strong>- Scene change –</strong></p><p>It has been two weeks since I woke up.</p><p>Believe me that I never thought I would say this but floating in the Observation Pod did have an advantage…. I didn’t need my diapers being changed.</p><p>That seriously sucks.</p><p>I was still being observed but now I was kept under the constant eyes of people. All my vitals are being observed so no random movements.</p><p>I did however keep my training up in a different way.</p><p>I still kept moving my strange energy around my body and found a way to increase my strength. With the control that I have over my power, I can make the energy more chaotic or controlled with a mere thought. Concentrating the chaotic part of the energy on a single part of my body, more specifically the muscles during a time when the energy is stirred more violently by my thoughts can lead to minute tears in my muscles. The Observation Haki is an insane skill in this matter as I can ‘feel’ the wear and tear in my body. This is followed by healing the same part with the smoother flow of the energy. It is really amazing to see the same energy acting in such different ways with different applications of it. Repeating this process over and over did give me a slight increase in power every time. The Mad Doctor Essence’s knowledge of medicine helped me maintain stable growth over my body.</p><p>My body, as I had already noticed, was different from a human’s. That said I couldn’t keep away the probability of the biology of humans in this world being different altogether.</p><p>I also observe everyone’s emotions around me to know that this was not recorded by anyone or else they would have been like monkeys with their butt on fire.</p><p>That is not to say that everything was going fine.</p><p>These people hardly came around me and I was still given food artificially.</p><p>I couldn’t hear their voices.</p><p>That did put a damper on collecting information.</p><p>Sometimes a few of them did speak and I remember being called ‘Young Lord’.</p><p>The reverence and adoration in that voice, a woman I guess was almost dripping and it reassured me that I am not going to be screwed that easily….maybe.</p><p>It was a plus to know that they were talking in English.</p><p>I don’t know what I would have done if I had to learn the language to start collecting information. Now that would have sucked major balls.</p><p>I however decided to keep the Binder slots free for now.</p><p>It was because I didn’t know how that would work and if others can see when I invoke the power.</p><p>I know that the marks cannot be seen or altered by others but it never said anything about the invocation.</p><p>It was too tempting to just mark the first person that I had a skin contact with to know what was going on around here.</p><p>The woman who called me ‘Young Lord’ had slightly lower Power Reserves than me.</p><p>Well what can I say? I am a very powerful baby.</p><p>The other thing that I have been able to advance was my Observation Haki.</p><p>Now I could use my sight and hearing better so the Observation Haki did gain a significant boost.</p><p>We never realize how much we depend on our sight and hearing to observe our surroundings until it is taken away.</p><p>Right now I can use Observation Haki upto 500m around me. Apparently that near death? Or rather, the second death for me did more than enough to push my Observation Haki to another level.</p><p>I could feel them but still couldn’t hear them properly because the room in which I was kept was again soundproof, that said the beeping of machines was a welcome noise this time.</p><p>I could also identify the difference between the different people using their auras only.</p><p>It helped me to keep track of their identities and how I could remember who came to change my diapers and when.</p><p>The shift in rotation is completely random because I cannot find any pattern in it.</p><p>The woman who called me ‘Young Lord’ has only come twice now.</p><p>The other time was nine days after her first appearance.</p><p>I am not even sure if there will be any use marking them with my binder if they are mere nurses.</p><p>So there is a fair chance that I could mark them despite all of the risks that are involved in it and then find out that she couldn’t come to me regularly.</p><p>I would be wasting a mark unnecessarily.</p><p>Jeez, can’t someone give a two year old a break in his plan to conquer the world?</p><p>Really, is it too much to ask?</p><p>This was finally the day there was a change.</p><p>The door opened and a few people came in while I merely turned my head in their direction.</p><p>My eyes work much better now that it has adjusted to….well seeing.</p><p>The one in the lead is the scientist that comes in most frequently while I was in this room followed by three more people.</p><p>I pushed my Observation Haki out once more and stilled.</p><p>One of them was the same monster as the last time. I couldn’t forget that energy because it terrified me for the first time in this world.</p><p>At least this time I saw the face of this person. Silver hair and red eyes. The bastard was quite handsome.</p><p>The only thing that soothed my heart somewhat was the fact that he now only had around 30 times more power reserves than me.</p><p>Then again raw energy wouldn’t be that much of an indicator. The skills of this person was definitely something if all these scientists were actually sucking up to him.</p><p>The second and third ones were not that far behind. The second one was another man with brown hair and was even stronger than the first one. Not too much of a difference but a difference nonetheless. While the third one another silver haired one with blue eyes and was slightly less around 15 times more than my power reserves.</p><p>The last man was a black haired one with purple eyes and….is that a pointed ear?</p><p>Elf? Dark Elf?</p><p>The fuck….just where am I?</p><p>The final one was a woman who was around the same level as the first two and she had brown hair and wore glasses.</p><p>“What is the situation of the child?” asked the monster.</p><p>A scientist started answering, “The subject is <a href=\"https://fine….”….it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">fine….”….it</a> however was not completed as I saw that the head of that person was blown off into a rain of blood and flesh all across the room.</p><p>“The child is not a ….<em>subject</em>.” growled the brown haired woman stilling every scientist in the room and I swear that if I hadn’t peed a while ago, I might have just let some of it lose right now. My Occlumency ran its full power at the moment’s notice as I pushed all the thoughts out of my head making it blank again.</p><p>If anything was observed right now, it would only be my surprise at the explosion and nothing afterwards.</p><p>Newborn….technically, babies are not supposed to be afraid of death….or even understand what blowing someone’s head is supposed to be.</p><p>“It will do well for you all to remember whose blood flows through this child’s veins. I will not stand any insult to this blood.” She growled out.</p><p>Hot damn lady, is it that time of the month?</p><p>While I would have liked to ask this, my mind was currently running at a fast pace to take in every bit of information.</p><p>“Y-yes My Lady.” The scientist who led them stammered.</p><p>“T-The Young Lord has recovered completely from the m-mishap of two weeks ago. He slept for eight hours after that but his body had recovered well enough during that time. We found his healing to be several times faster than others. He has also exhibited a resistance to normal poisons which would have harmed anyone of his age. This enabled us to continue administering the enhancement drug to him for a whole two years in which he was administered over one hundred dosages of the drug which is a record whereas the one who had survived longest before this was only about two and a half months with five dosages. In the period of two years there has been a massive increase in his power reserves.”</p><p>So I slept for a period of eight hours after that. It does narrow out how much time had passed.</p><p>“That is to be expected considering his lineage. He is our key to defeating those two abominations,” growled the brown haired one. “What is his current power level?”</p><p>“Currently, he is around the High level of High Class and could almost be considered a Peak High Class if it is only in terms of his reserves. We do not recommend any further usage of drug enhancement as it can cause harm to him. It would be prudent to let him associate with the world and learn more about it.”</p><p>“Then so be it. Razevan,” the silver haired one looked towards the brown haired one, “I hear that you are having a child as well….even if it’s a half breed.” Spat out the brown haired one. “Bring the child there and raise him. We will plan out further training till then.”</p><p>The silver haired one looked a little red and Observation haki did observe how angry he really was. He however merely nodded which was a good decision knowing the difference in power between the two.</p><p>“Has your father said anything about the child yet?” asked the black haired one who had been quiet till now.</p><p>The man shook his head but didn’t comment.</p><p>“In that case allow me to name the child since he contains the blood of my ancestor as well.”</p><p>The others probably were alright and nodded.</p><p>The black haired one picked me up and raised me and all the while I was having ‘The Lion King’ flashbacks. Dude just don’t yeet me of any cliffs!.</p><p>“I name you Damien Lucifer. The one who contains the blood of two of the True Satans, Lucifer and Asmodeus. You shall bring us to our true positions as the rightful rulers of the Underworld, the whole Devil Race and then the whole world.”</p><p>The room cheered while I…. peed.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>I am in Highschool Dxd.</p><p><strong>- ??? Pov –</strong></p><p>“Report.”</p><p>“The subject has regained its consciousness. The vitals are normal. The physical conditions are all normal. The increase in the power reserves is 2.25 times during the last dosage although the target had lost its vitals completely for a whole minute before it was restored.”</p><p>“Was there any information about the power that blasted from him before losing vitals?” the unknown voices asked.</p><p>“No Sir. We still haven’t been able to find anything about that power. The surrounding staff had all lost their consciousness and the range was a whole kilometre around the subject. Only the more powerful ones barely held on to their consciousness. There were however some exceptions as well on both sides where some of those with more reserves fainted while some with lower reserves remained unaffected. We are still unsure about the reason as to whether the attack was irregular or whether it was for some other reason and are trying to find out a common pattern among all those who were conscious.”</p><p>“Do whatever test is necessary and make reports about each person’s experience when stuck with that power. I want all important and unimportant details to be covered. DO NOT MISS ANYTHING. I would hate to lose a capable person like you due to some petty carelessness.” The voice ordered almost uncaringly….almost.</p><p>The listener however was completely aware of what it was.</p><p>It was a do or die statement.</p><p>With sweat running down his forehead, he bowed and stepped back leaving the person to his lonesome.</p><p>After the scientist left, the man stood up and walked to the wall in front of him and a magic circle lit up while the wall folded in itself revealing a lab behind it.</p><p>In the middle of the lab was an Observation Pod with a woman with black hair floating in it.</p><p>The man walked up to the pod and touched it softly while his face lit up in a smirk. “Soon mother. I will have all the actors needed for my final play. The world shall watch and I shall enjoy their despair.”</p><p>The sound of laughter echoing throughout the room after that would have made anyone’s skin crawl with fear.</p><p>__________________________________x__________________________________________________________________x________________________________</p><p><strong>Beta Reader: LuluViBritania(FF.N, SB and QQ)/-LuluViB|99th BritannianEmperor(Discord)</strong></p><p><strong>Author’s Note :</strong></p><p><strong>I have started another fic.</strong></p><p><strong>It has been a year since I started ‘The Game Must Go On’ and I wanted to write something new.</strong></p><p><strong>I am absolutely not dropping the previous story.</strong></p><p><strong>I have the plot more or less finalized for that one to give up now.</strong></p><p><strong>This one on the other hand is a work in progress.</strong></p><p><strong>I do hope that you will like this.</strong></p><p><strong>Damien will be much darker than Shin because unlike Shin who was thrown into an adult body, Damien will have to live his childhood again and that too among the likes of the Old Satan Faction.</strong></p><p><strong>I had thought about the background that I wanted and had decided on many choices.</strong></p><p><strong>One was a normal Human.</strong></p><p><strong>That would have been interesting to say the least.</strong></p><p><strong>Both easier and harder at the same time. I have already stated that I intend to make this one darker as I have no intention of skimming over the darker parts of the story like I do in ‘The Game Must Go On’ and show a new take on the background of the Old Satan Faction according to me.</strong></p><p><strong>This will lead to his views becoming darker over time.</strong></p><p><strong>And yes Razevan is Vali’s father. That means Vali is about to be born and thus Damien will be around two and a half years older than Vali.</strong></p><p><strong>Their relationship will be shown later on.</strong></p><p><strong>I know that Essence CYOAs break the world very easily but as you have seen already….death is on every step.</strong></p><p><strong>How he survives this time will be totally on him. Damien will use plotting and seduction, murder and politics….everything he can use to get a higher ground.</strong></p><p><strong>The thoughts that Damien has about the world will be changed further.</strong></p><p><strong>It will not be the same ‘I have the cheats so others can fuck off’ for the entire fic.</strong></p><p><strong> I know that this chapter has mostly been him ranting off bitching about things but….semi sensory deprivation inside an Observation Pod right after the birth kinda does a number on anyone’s mind.</strong></p><p><strong>Anyways, hold on to it. I promise that it will be worth it.</strong></p><p><strong>(This one will have more lemons, you leechers.)</strong></p><p><strong>Good Day, Peace Out.</strong></p><p><br></p>",
