    "content": "<p>I waited until Aviada was reasonably aroused until I started pumping my mana inside her, triggering a flood of experience for her. </p><p>[-915 Mana]</p><p>Her eyes widened in shock, one that would have been suspicious even as she struggled under the growing throes of pleasure, but luckily, Carla was too focused on the location where our bodies were meeting with each other repeatedly to actually pay attention to Aviada’s face as she looked at me questioningly. </p><p>Luckily, she proved to be a touch wiser than I had given her a credit to, and kept her mouth shut when I sent her a warning glare. Or at least, that was what I assumed was the reason, but considering her personality, I feared that it was more about the growing pressure of her orgasm. Only a few seconds later she let out a string of moans, suggesting that her not blurting what happened might be more about the rush of pleasure than any genuine sense of trying to keep things hidden. </p><p>Just to be safe, I grabbed her discarded panties and stuffed her mouth, continuing to pump into her vigorously. </p><p>And with that, the risk carried by Aviada’s mouth was effectively disarmed, allowing me to focus on the other sexy martial goddess in the room, who was absentmindedly playing with her beautiful red hair as she watched us with a shocked expression, still having trouble believing what was going on. </p><p>I expected that state to last for a while, thinking what I should do, when she opened her mouth. “You look red,” she said mockingly as she looked at Aviada, earning a frustrated groan, but when Aviada tried to answer by removing her panties out of her mouth, I was quick to prevent it. But true to her personality, she tried to push her hand, making me continue to grab her hand. </p><p>“She’s a bit occupied,” I said calmly even as I continued to pump inside her, enjoying the way she tightened as I exerted direct physical control over her. It was interesting to see just how similar the magical star of the school, Cornelia, and one of the more infamous martial students, Aviada, was similar despite all their outward difference, creating an alliance of submission, requiring forceful suppression more than occasionally. The only thing that differed was their preferred mode, Aviada preferring direct applications of strength while Cornelia enjoyed fanciful indirect displays of casting, especially in terms of explosive spells. </p><p>“Why don’t you entertain me a bit, then,” Carla answered, looking at me directly, no matter how much her eyes stirred toward Aviada’s tits. </p><p>Her words, if taken at face value, were filled with innuendo. But at this point, I was rather good at reading women —especially when it came to the matters of intimacy— and her words lacked that kind of intent. It was just an automatic response. She was just saying what came to her mind directly. Of course, that didn’t mean I would actually let that slide. “If you wish so?” I answered in a tone laced with erotic intent. Considering I was fucking her best friend in front of her mercilessly, it wasn’t exactly hard emotion to exaggerate. “Any preferred method?” </p><p>It took a second for her to realize what I meant. “N-no,” she stammered before continuing with a sharper, panicked tone. “Not like that! How can you say that, while fucking Aviada? Have you no shame?” </p><p>“I clearly don’t,” I said with a mocking smirk. “Also do you think Aviada looks like she would mind if I buried my face between your glorious tits,” I said, letting my gaze dip down her bosom, which was rather visible thanks to her nightshirt. </p><p>“She might not, but I’m not a pervert,” Carla answered, which might have been more convincing if she hadn’t been watching me as I fucked Aviada passionately. </p><p>“Oh, really?” I asked, the mocking edge in my tone intensifying. “Is that why you have been watching us from a corner while playing with yourself like a horny little slut? Or is that why you’re still here even as I fuck poor little Aviada,” I said, using the opportunity to flood Aviada’s insides with my mana once more. </p><p>[-1318 Mana]</p><p>“N-no,” she managed to stammer, her eyes wide open, too distracted with her own arousal to react to my words, especially since she was clearly feeling quite aroused. “T-this is nonsense, I’m leaving!” she managed to exclaim a moment later, standing up to leave. </p><p>Though, after getting up to her feet, she continued to stand rather than moving toward the door, spending a couple of extra seconds watching us like she was trying to etch it to her memory. It was a fatal mistake, I decided even as I grabbed her arm and pulled her back on the bed. Though, considering her lack of panic despite the yelp that escaped, it was hard to say she didn’t want that mistake. </p><p>Her reaction was understandable. It might be a bit vain to say, but my looks were hard to match. Not only I was a spectacular physical specimen, but also I had more than fifty points of Charisma supporting me, giving me an extraordinary aura. Dominating such a spectacular beauty like Aviada while easily immobilizing her with one hand, just added another layer of attractiveness to a martial student like Carla. “Let me go,” she stammered, but her voice was lacking conviction, trembling weakly. </p><p>“Really, that’s what you want?” I asked mockingly. </p><p>“Yes…” she said after taking a deep breath, but despite her preparation, what escaped her mouth was a soft tremble, lacking any kind of conviction. She clearly said that just to play hard, her eyes glazing whenever it slid down, watching my hips as they continued to slam inside Aviada again and again. </p><p>Which was why she was surprised when I loosened my grip around her wrist. She looked at me, shocked, unhappy with the sudden change. “Is there a problem? I did what you asked?” </p><p>“Nothing…” she murmured, trying to process the sudden change, which wasn’t made any easier by Aviada’s muffled yet enthusiastic moans. </p><p>“Is that so?” I said even as I decided to finish our little game. I slipped my hand inside her pajama bottoms, which was already straining to cover her wide hips, dipping directly into her wetness, making her moan. “It seems that your body disagrees.\"</p><p>“What are you doing!” she exclaimed in shock before another moan interrupted her, but the movement of her body was much more telling. Rather than trying to pull back, she slid even closer, even widening her legs to give man easier access. </p><p>“What am I doing?” I said mockingly even as I slipped my fingers deeper without the slightest issue, making her gasp in shock. “I’m fingering you, just like you want, you dirty girl. Or are you going to say that you usually hang around people having sex with no ulterior motive?” </p><p>“B-but-” she tried to stammer an answer, her gaze falling on Aviada, realizing that it was rather presumptuous for me to finger another woman next to her. </p><p>“Don’t worry,” I said even as I decided to move forward in a more memorable manner, and ripped off her pajamas with a rough pull along with her panties, leaving her bottom bare. “It wouldn’t be the first threesome she experienced,” I added even as I slapped her ass, my other hand still around her wrists, preventing her from retaliating. </p><p>She opened her mouth to argue, but when my fingers returned to her entrance, she was quick to abandon those. “You don’t need to talk,” I said even as I let my fingers loose inside her, ramming furiously. “You clearly want this, you don’t have to be a coward. Just admit it.”</p><p>The first reaction came from Aviada, who finally managed to get rid of her makeshift gag. “Wait-” she tried to argue, only to be silenced by a stiff spank to her ass, even though it forced me to abandon Carla’s fingering for a moment. </p><p>“Don’t be rude! You don’t have a right to speak, not before you can free your hands,” I commented even as I let my hand return to Carla’s body, but this time, grabbing her lush red hair, pulling her into a searing kiss. </p><p>Unsurprisingly, the insult and the challenge were more than enough to silence Aviada, while my display of physical dominance tightened her even further, earning another moan. Her submissiveness was such a convenient trait. </p><p>I pushed my shaft deeper into Aviada’s tightness while my lips launched a surprise assault to Carla’s unprepared mouth, attaining victory immediately, my tongue ravaging it freely. She just obediently accepted my assault, her body aching for my touch. </p><p>With both of my hands occupied —one around Aviada’s wrists, the other wrapped around Carla’s hair— I couldn’t rip off her shirt. Luckily, with my magic, I didn’t need to. A simple air spell was enough to shred it into nothingness, earning a shocked gasp from Carla, who didn’t appreciate the rather risky display of my magical competence, unaware of the limits of my magical capabilities. But with my tongue still buried in her mouth, she didn’t have the chance to vocalize her argument, and it wasn’t clearly important enough to pull back to deliver it. </p><p>So, I continued to kiss her aggressively even as her gloriously large breasts, big enough to rival Marianne’s, pushed against my chest, the hardness of her nipples rather noticeable against my chest. </p><p>Enjoying the lips of beauty while the other one continuously tightened around my girth made it rather hard to resist my body’s desire to explode, so I did so, filling Aviada with my warm seed, triggering another climax of hers. As she collapsed, I finally pulled out of her and let her hands go, turning my full attention to Carla. </p><p>The muffled gasp she let out as my hand found her breasts, sinking into the depths of her supple flesh, was rather spectacular. Maybe it was her body type, maybe it was the advantage given by her stats, but her tits were spectacularly sexy. </p><p>Carla’s sensual moans made things even better as I continued to squeeze her breasts, enjoying their texture to my heart’s content. Said moans finally exploded without muffling when my lips trailed down, kissing down her neck, leaving aggressive hickeys behind. </p><p>She pressed her hips against my body, capturing my half-erect shaft between her thighs, though, in their embrace, it didn’t take long for it to return back to life, squeezed between her meaty embrace. </p><p>Even if I hadn’t been aroused before, the delicious gyration of her hips would have solved the problem, using her best advantage to a great effect. She might be a voyeur, but she had no problems in adapting my touch. And her juices slowly coating my already glistening shaft, it wasn’t hard to guess where things were going. </p><p>Then, Aviada reminded one important detail, that I had forgotten her presence. She reacted as violently as I had expected her to, replacing my hand around Carla’s hair, pulling her back with an aggressiveness that made her cry in pain. I was about to react to prevent violence when I realized Aviada’s aim, and relaxed. </p><p>Meanwhile, Carla found herself forced down her lips inches away from my shaft which was hardened thanks to her efforts. “Open wide, bitch,” Aviada gloated smugly even as she pressed Carla’s head forward. “Do you think you can mock me without a cost,” she added gleefully, but weirdly enough, her anger felt rather mischievous. Apparently, it counted as a friendly move in Aviada’s dictionary. </p><p>No doubt she had problems making friends, if that was the way she could treat her best friend. </p><p>Carla opened her mouth, whether trying to argue or asking for a reprieve I didn’t know, because Aviada didn’t miss a beat before pushing her head forward, clogging her mouth with my thickness…</p><p>Apparently, things were about to have an unexpected —but no means unwelcome— turn…</p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 30    Experience: 447193 / 465000 </p><p>Strength: 41    Charisma: 53</p><p>Precision: 35    Perception: 37</p><p>Agility: 35     Manipulation: 40</p><p>Speed: 34       Intelligence: 44</p><p>Endurance: 34      Wisdom: 46</p><p>HP: 5370  / 5370\tMana: 6600  / 6600        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Master Subterfuge [97/100]         </p><p>Master Arcana [95/100]        </p><p>Expert Speech [70/75]</p><p>Advanced Craft [50/50]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 21/25]</p><p>[Helga - Level 17/21] </p>",

    "content": "<p>As much as I wanted to continue playing with Emma and Aria, ultimately, I decided to stop for two reasons, and sent them back to their room. First, despite the confused enjoyment they had derived from the treatment, the girls were getting pretty exhausted, which made pushing them more was a dangerous affair. It was evident by the exhausted walk of shame they displayed as they walked back to their room, carrying the scraps of their dresses in their hands rather than bothering to put them on. </p><p>Second, and more important was the upcoming meeting with the Queen in the club. The previous visit had been an accidental stumble, but I was able to handle that because Sapphire was as unprepared as me. However, I respected her enough to expect her to be better prepared this time, meaning I needed to have some tricks to rely on. Luckily, I had watched her as she had cast that tantric spell using my ‘gift’, meaning she had no intention of flooding the club with a bunch of knights trying to imprison me. </p><p>Too bad that after my last sabotage, she would be working with sabotaged spells, making success a virtual impossibility. </p><p>Still, that was no reason to slack off, I decided as I once again left the palace grounds. Unlike the previous times, it wasn’t as much risk. Aria and Emma were already aware of my freedom, while Lancelot and Isolde were away to discover the cache I had sold the Queen in my other guise. The only possible visitor was the Queen, but it was the middle of the day, meaning unless there was an important reason, she wouldn’t just disappear from the throne room to interrogate me. </p><p>It was a reasonable risk to take. </p><p>It turned out that arranging the safety measures was easier than I had first assumed. A short trip to the spy I had discovered after following Emma’s councilwoman friend had proved quite useful on that aspect, as it turned out that he had some connections with the club itself. A pleasant surprise that cut my time quite a bit. After arranging a few spies disguised as customers to be used if needed —and extorting quite a bit gold to be used as needed— I went to the club, using the introduction to smooth things further, easily arranging a private room. Things had turned a bit more interesting when I asked the Seductress —Sapphire’s stage name— to be sent to the private room I had arranged once she arrived. </p><p>“I’m afraid that’s impossible, sir,” the manager said with a trembling tone, smart enough to realize he was in front of an extremely dangerous man despite the commoner clothes I had been wearing. No wonder he could successfully manage a club successfully for a noble clientele. “She’s not a part of the club officially, so we don’t have any right to order her anything. She has never done a private show before.” </p><p>“Don’t worry about it,” I said even as I passed her a note. “Just pass this note to her, and she’ll handle the rest. If she doesn’t follow the recommendation, it’s something between us. No need for you to worry.” Then, I paused for a moment, then chuckled. “However, I would recommend you to arrange a satisfactory replacement for her, because your customers might be unhappy with the sudden change.” </p><p>“I’ll do that, sir,” he said in appreciation, earning my admiration. It was always hard to find proficient help that was smart enough to understand the situation with such clarity, while still maintained a healthy level of ambition that wouldn’t lead to backstabbing at the earliest opportunity. </p><p>After that, I didn’t have much to do other than enjoy the perks of the private room, which included spectacular food —poison-free, even— and a luxuriously decadent bath with a lot of bubbles. I didn’t waste all my time lazing around, though. Instead, I tinkered around with the wards of the room, enhancing the privacy wards several times, making sure no sound or errant mana would escape its confines. After I finished, it could even function as a temporary fort in case of an assault, standing still quite a bit after the rest of the building turned into cinders and dust.</p><p>However, as the sun was about to set, I went back to the palace using the secret tunnel, and started waiting near the queen’s entrance, just in case she decided to drop by my cell before the visit. </p><p>I waited for almost an hour before the secret entrance of her room finally opened, and she stepped in the dark shadows of the secret tunnel, once again wearing a thick cloak over her disguise, turning her beautiful golden locks into a luscious black, reflecting her sharp personality quite a bit better. Luckily, she was far too occupied with the ‘mysterious spy’ character to actually pay a visit to the poor dark lord rotting in her dungeon… </p><p>I followed her until she was safely inside the club, but as I watched one of the secretaries pass the note to her, I slipped back to the private room I had arranged earlier, once again shedding my prisoner clothes in favor of the new ones I had acquired during the day. </p><p>When the side door opened —one that was dedicated for the dancers— I turned toward the noise with a smirk on my face. “Welcome, my Queen,” I stood up, giving an exaggerated bow that turned into a mockery. </p><p>“Hello, sir,” she answered even as she pushed her cloak down, revealing her body, wearing a variation of yesterday’s costume, mysterious yet transparent blacks and reds covering her curvy body, hinting everything without revealing anything. At the surface level, her tone was sharp, revealing her frustration. I had to admit, she was a good actor. If I hadn’t already known about her plan to get the upper hand, I would have missed the domineering echoes of a victorious opponent. </p><p>I was having trouble reading her, because, unlike the previous time, she wasn’t unbalanced by a couple of unexpected climaxes. </p><p>Luckily, I could feel a tantric connection being slowly established between us, following the latest updates I had added to the spellbook she had stolen from my library, meaning it was even easier to turn her into the panting and moaning mess of the previous day. Just to make things perfect, it would be impossible for her to detect that, because it would be hidden by her own spell. Just a mistake, and her victory was unattainable. </p><p>How tragic. </p><p>“You shouldn’t have bothered to dress, I have already prepared an outfit for you,” I said as I pointed at a screen at the end of the room, smirking as I said so. She looked angry, smart enough to understand that the stuff that lay behind the screen door wouldn’t be exactly flattering to her position in life as the Queen —maybe even as a respectable dancer— while being extremely flattering to her curvy figure. </p><p>“As you wish, sir,” she muttered, this time, her coldness slightly more genuine, which was understandable. She managed to climb to the top of the Empire, taking control —as much as possible in such an unwieldy entity with many different political powers, especially since open assassinations and frequent disappearances were frowned upon, unlike my dark faction. The fact that she had to follow my orders, even fleetingly as she tried to use the opportunity to emotionally enslave me, must burn in her heart fiercely. </p><p>Though, that fury reflected the sway of her hips in a very productive manner, creating a delicious view that turned my pants into an unbearable prison in an instant. The frustrated gasp that she let out the moment she disappeared behind the screen didn’t help my frustration, even if I had spent the morning fucking the princess of the Empire along with the spectacularly famous Elementalist Emma. </p><p>“Also, don’t forget to get rid of all of your disguises,” I warned her. “I don’t want to see your mask, or that fake hair color. I wanted to enjoy your … service properly.” </p><p>“As you wish, sir,” she repeated, even colder than the precious time before disappearing behind the screen. </p><p>Luckily, I hadn’t had to wait for long, as after a couple of minutes, Sapphire stepped out in the open, her elegant costume as the Seductress gone, replaced by the mockery of a maid costume that was worn around the palace. The maid costume worn around the palace was black and white, giving a sense of decadent elegance while managing to look impervious at the same time. </p><p>Sapphire didn’t have the same luxury when it came to her costume. Unlike the original form, the cleavage was deep and loose enough to make a watcher pray for the whole dress to came down accidentally, staying up only as a miracle. The skirt was no better. If it was an inch shorter, it would be classified as a belt rather than a skirt, and its frills weren’t making it any easier to stay properly in place as she walked, occasionally revealing the absence of any kind of underwear. </p><p>The glorious shine of her golden blonde, combined with the lack of a mask, got rid of the only possible mental trick she could use to isolate herself from the situation. </p><p>However, the real killing blow was the choker. Made from a mixture of silver and gold, it was an implied conveyor of my ownership over her, which, considering her position, extremely insulting without considering the design choices. “Do you like your choker?” I asked even as I wondered whether she had already put the second accessory I had put there. “I have designed it especially for you, inspired by your crown.”</p><p>“T-thank you, sir,” she managed to say, even curtsying as she did so, which, considering the deficient costume she was wearing, provided me with a delicious view of her current costume. However, neither the stammer, nor the flash of cleavage deep enough to show her nipples was accidental, because that was followed by a subtle spread of magic that would enhance my infuriation with her significantly, one that I would have missed if it wasn’t for my own expertise in the area. Still, for me, it was just another topic I had learned to defend myself, she was an expert. </p><p>Too bad for her that due to faction preferences, I had much better access to knowledge, forcing her to rely on my second-hand notes to cast her spells. Since I was the one that created the trick she was trying to use, dispelling its effects without making her aware was trivial, so was reflecting a part of the spell back. Unlike her attempt, I wasn’t trying to entangle her emotionally, but making sure to enhance the physical backlash she would receive from the subsequent spells. </p><p>And since I had already noted that short-term arousal was a common side effect of the spell, she shouldn’t realize anything was wrong until it was too late. </p><p>“Why don’t you take a seat so we can have a discussion before we start,” I said to her, but when she turned toward the other armchair in the room, I gestured her to stop. “That’s not your seat,” I said to her before pointing at a thin cushion in front of me. “That’s your seat.” </p><p>The anger that flashed in her blue eyes was simply spectacular. And since, unlike the last time, I wasn’t afraid of a sudden outburst due to updated isolating wards, making it easier to tease her. Not allowing her to sit, but crouch in front of me like a supplicant definitely counted as such. Still, she stood frozen for a moment, making me wonder whether I pushed too fast too quick, but that thought evaporated when she took a step toward the cushion. “As you wish, sir,” she repeated as she slowly crouched, somehow managing to turn the simple movement into a delicious show. </p><p>I looked down as she completed the movement, enjoying the spectacular sight and the power implied in the position equally. The revealing cleavage had turned obscene from my superior viewing angle, revealing the tempting hardness of her nipples. The skirt part of her costume didn’t fare any better, riding up to reveal her delicious ass, especially from the side, barely able to hide her core. However, her utter lack of any kind of disguise turned it from an erotic scene into a true picture of victory. </p><p>Maybe I should have a painter to immortalize the moment, I thought absentmindedly, smiling as I imagined that. However, even as I did so, I couldn’t help but wonder about the reason for her obedience. Why the hell they were treating Eternal Core with such importance. From the subtle probes I made when they were too distracted by arousal, it didn’t seem like Aria or Emma knew much about the reason, other than it being very important to Empire’s survival, supposedly to power an ancient weapon, but I wouldn’t put it past the Queen to mislead them intentionally for a different objective. </p><p> Taking the risk of imprisoning me was one thing. It was extremely inadvisable, but since I was already captured, and immobilized with a supposedly unbreakable artifact, it was somehow understandable. </p><p>However, for a prideful person like Sapphire to accept such indignity with no resistance other than the occasional whimper, it must be really important. Today was even more noticeable than the precious time, where she had the luxury of blaming her shock… </p><p>Maybe I should try interrogating her about her need. After a round of proper fun, of course. </p><p>Or maybe two… Three at most…</p>",

    "content": "<p>Despite the significance of all of the slaves except me escaping, I didn’t felt much pressure as I watched Theodora disappear in the darkness of the night. After all, for better or worse, I was the only merchandise in their hands, the only hope to turn any kind of profit during the trip, so even if they overstretched and decided to blame me, they couldn’t take it on me. </p><p>Not with all of their money and slaves gone. The money they would get for me was the only hope for them. </p><p>Still, I wanted to keep my involvement secret, more to prevent them from alerting my new so-called owners if not for anything else. Luckily, I had the perfect scapegoat, and an excellent way to display that. So, after carefully casting  I went to my cage and dragged the idiot that I killed earlier with me, and broke his neck before dropping it to a location where I could theoretically reach to break his neck using my legs. Since he already made that particular tale very convincing by drugging the whole camp, I didn’t see any problems convincing the rest of the slavers about the real responsible. </p><p>I spent the rest of the night creating a small magical hole to hide the rest of my riches in the cart —to be buried once I was closer to Rome— and reshaping the spearhead into some kind of bracelet. I had to sacrifice some of the explosive power of the spearhead, but the ability to carry that with me as a gladiator was more than compensated for it. After all, who would take an extremely ugly iron bracelet, even from a slave. </p><p>The commotion that I expected to happen finally exploded after the first lights of the morning. “What’s going on,” shouted many people as they groggily woke up from their drugged sleep, realizing that their riches had disappeared while they had been betrayed. From there, it didn’t take long for them to discover they still had one slave. “What happened here,” asked the leader in shock, looking like he was about to have an aneurysm.</p><p>“I don’t know,” I answered with a shrug. “That waste of space tried to kill me at midnight while whispering about making everyone pay, so I broke his neck,” I answered with a shrug.</p><p>“He must be responsible,” said one of the guards, desperate to find someone to lash out, raising his spear, only to receive a slap from the leader. </p><p>“Are you a moron or what?” said the leader. “Why would he be here if he was the one to free the other slaves, rather than escaping with them,” he called. “And he’s the only merchandise we have, do you really want the whole trip to be wasted.” </p><p>“No, sir,” said the first one, properly chastised. </p><p>“Good. Now, we’re going to split into four groups. Three people will accompany me to Rome so we can deliver him to Ludus Dacicus, and get our money. He’s worth almost as much as the rest of the stock combined, so we don’t have a great deficit. The second group will stay here, defending the carts and other heavy equipment. Group three and four will do their best to track the escaped slaves,” he ordered, unaware that their cursed brand had been already sabotaged by me, leaving them helplessly locked in place. </p><p>They didn’t ask my opinion before mounting me onto a horse, but they weren’t complete idiots, so they kept my hands tied. Still, they were lucky that I wanted to follow their plan —if one calls losing all of their stock and money at the same time lucky in the first place. </p><p>The ride passed in silence. Who knew that losing all of their money and prisoners would make slavers such unreasonable travel companions.</p><p>So, rather than focusing on them, I watched the surrounding countryside. As the afternoon sun hit, we finally left the mountainous area completely, descending onto the plains of the Italian countryside. A vast expanse of farmland sprawled out before us, filled with endless fields, hordes of slaves working on them. It reminded me of Britanium, only with a nicer climate and denser farms. </p><p>The only real difference was the density of the estates sprawled around, which had two big differences compared to back home. First, the country villas were much bigger and fancier than what we had back on the island, rivaling many nobles. The second surprise was the surprising sparseness of the estates, suggesting that, unlike the colonies, these huge fertile farmlands belonged to rich landowners rather than the peasants. </p><p>The pattern continued as we got closer to Rome for a long while, villas getting both bigger and more distant from each other, only for the trend to reverse once we were a couple of hours away from Rome on horseback. The villas continued to get bigger and fancier, surpassing even the governor’s house back in the island —not that I had an opportunity to see the inside of that place, only a distant glimpse— though the distance between them got smaller, the area leveraged as orchards and carefully-maintained gardens rather than grain farmland. </p><p>Then, Rome appeared on the horizon, its walls creating an intimidating view. However, even more, impressive were the wards that were attached to those walls, radiating a domineering magical presence constantly. No wonder the city had never been invaded by a foreign presence, even when Hannibal had ravaged the countryside for two decades, evaporating Rome armies one after another, until my distant ancestor finally reversed and invaded his homeland. The city only fell against Julius Caesar —my accidental benefactor— and even then, it was deserted by the defenders rather than being sieged properly. </p><p>I needed to be careful inside, because I wasn’t exactly willing to test myself against the walls directly. Being a sorcerer might be an amazing achievement out in the colonies and provinces, but in Rome, at the heart of the Republic, it was certainly not so. </p><p>Luckily, they were still rare enough that no one sane would suspect a slave of being one, not when even an ordinary mage with proper experience could save himself from the slavers. My disguise as a Thracian warrior made the situation even better. </p><p>The guards at the walls didn’t create many problems, requiring only the slavers to show their credentials —as well as flashing me flashing my mark in my hand, magically created to replicate their stamp, but consisting of illusion instead— before they let us inside. It wasn’t entirely surprising. Rome was a big city, too busy to give a detailed assessment of every single entrant. </p><p>“Quite a sight, ain’t it, boy?” said the slaver, finally feeling cheerful as we moved toward the center of the city, almost toward the Pomerium itself. I could feel the legendary magic-blocking wards of Pomerium, trying to suppress the elements surrounding me even from a distance. I could push through it, but not without a great effort, but luckily, my assumption about the ward was correct. It had limited effect on non-violent contained effect, and almost none on internal spells. </p><p>“A bit crowded,” I said gruffly, still playing the proud warrior. </p><p>He chuckled. “You’ll grow used to it. Ludus might be a hard place to live, but also you’ll eat better than you ever did, and fuck more beautiful women than you could ever imagine in your dinky little tribe.” I scoffed, which earned a laugh as we finally arrived at a large series of buildings surrounding a courtyard, very close to the famous Colosseum. I had never seen it before, but it didn’t take a genius to identify its impressive marble walls filled with statues and posters of famous gladiators. </p><p>Meaning, the estate we were riding toward was likely the Ludus Dacicus, the Dacian Gladiator School, my new home for the foreseeable future… </p><p>“Who are you?” barked the guard at the door, a large, intimidatingly muscular man with a spear. </p><p>“I came to bring a promised Thracian slave to great Ludus Dacicus,” said the leader of the slavers, which didn’t make the guard as impressed as the leader had assumed. </p><p>“Show your documents,” he said, and after examining, he pointed at a corner of the courtyard, where eight other slaves were standing there under the sun. “You there, your first test is going there and standing without collapsing for three days, and if you fail, we’re going to send you to mines. You’re not allowed to talk as well.” </p><p>“That’s not what we were promised. The great Dacicus himself-” said the slaver, only to receive a loud slap from the guard. </p><p>“Did I ask your opinion, you idiot?” said the guard, before stamping the papers. “You’re just a fucking slaver. Normally, I wouldn’t even bother talking with a worm-like you, but feel lucky that we’re looking for new warriors after the disaster. Go the first building, they’ll pay you, and you then you can disappear before dirtying these hallowed grounds.” </p><p>“Take care,” I said mockingly even as I walked toward the area guard mentioned, which only earned a stiff laugh from the guard. It was clear that even a prospective gladiator was much more precious than a disposable slaver with a mistaken idea about his importance. </p><p>I walked toward the area the guard had pointed to without saying anything. As I walked, I extended my senses, trying to get a feeling of the place, which was only limited help. There were far too many people around, both in Ludus itself, and the area surrounding it, and my techniques, perfected in the chaotic magic fields of the sparse mountain proved too sensitive to actually yield any useful results. </p><p>The only advantage was that the school was actually not located in the Pomerium itself, unlike the Colosseum, receiving only a limited effect of the wards. So, if needed, I could use magic in relative ease, though that didn’t mean I had a carte-blanche. Doing so might still reveal my position. </p><p>So, I stood in the area that was pointed. It seemed like no one was paying attention to me as I stood there other than a passerby that threw insults, but after spending a year as a fugitive, my danger senses were developed enough to know there were several very dangerous people currently watching me, probably from one of the nearby windows, behind a curtain. I pushed the temptation to look up, not wanting to reveal the extent of my sixth sense. I wanted to impress them, but no need to impress them too much. </p><p>As I stood there, among a bunch of other slaves in various states of exhaustion and delirium, I said nothing, not even when the men that passed around me cursed and insulted, occasionally throwing rotten vegetables. I didn’t even feel anger, because their actions were clearly staged. They were testing us, not only in terms of endurance, but also in temperament. As I waited, one of the other slaves finally felt helpless enough to dash forward, attacking one of the gladiators, only to be slain with a stab of the sword, teaching the cost of disobedience to the rest of them. </p><p>Too bad for the school that I was magically aware enough to notice the illusion on the slave’s face. Not to mention the attack was too tame to contain true anger, but choreographed to look so, or the fact that the gladiator’s attack was delivered at the perfect angle to create a lot of blood, but actually make it extremely easy for a competent healer to handle. </p><p>Still, I liked their approach. It was vicious enough to know the threat of violence never worked as well as the display of violence, but smart enough not to waste a new slave just for that purpose. It suggested a dry competency I didn’t expect from a Ludus, but maybe I should have. After all, they were in the business of making death look good for centuries. It wasn’t surprising that they had figured out a few tricks to minimize their loss. </p><p>Standing there without food or water wasn’t a struggle for me, not even before my ascension, mostly thanks to the horrible training I had gone through as a child. This test was nothing compared to some of his tricks. Instead, I looked around, examining my surroundings. </p><p>A fifty-foot-high stone wall surrounded the inner courtyard. At the first glance, it looked like it was designed to keep people inside, and without a doubt, it was one of the aims, but a careful examination of the placements of the pens and smaller buildings inside suggested that it would work exceedingly well against the external attackers as well. </p><p>Considering their history, definitely a sensible precaution. </p><p>Inside the courtyard, there were a number of buildings, pens and training areas. Training areas were filled with blunted weapons, dummies, and many different types of weights, some suspiciously similar to stuff I had trained as a child, used by gladiators using them in familiar ways. </p><p>My childhood pain suddenly got a lot more understandable if my grandfather had leveraged the same training method as a bunch of slave-warriors fighting for show and survival… </p>",

    "content": "<p>When I arrived back at the school, I wasn’t surprised to meet with utter chaos. After all, as intimidating as they were, just one monster horde was hardly enough to dent the defensive measures of Silver Spires. There was a reason for its reputation as the greatest learning center in a world where everything was determined by combat capability. </p><p>But multiple monster hordes, forcing the school to choose between dispersing most of its elite fighting force to destroy them and losing all of its supporting infrastructure, leaving it isolated for a long and costly siege. </p><p>I started searching for Titania among the chaos, but a few discreet inquires I had initiated failed to give any useful result. So, I decided to try the same trick I had applied to track Cornelia and Helga. Since Titania’s progress was far from completion, getting an accurate sense of her direction was neither as effective nor as effortless, but luckily, it still worked from a close distance. I could easily feel Aviada’s and Oeyne’s locations.</p><p>Unfortunately, neither Titania nor Marianne was in the school. Not really the thing I had been looking for. </p><p>Paradoxically, I worried more about Titania than Marianne despite the huge gap in their strength. After all, Marianne was one of the better healers among the students even before the progress she had made thanks to my assistance. So, unless the team she was assigned was filled with complete morons, she would be protected to the best of their abilities as not everyone had my luxury of self-healing. </p><p>Titania, on the other hand, had been the target for at least one ambush, which would have been successful if it wasn’t for my accidental interruption. And during such an important mobilization, she was too important to be kept hidden completely. While asking a few random soldiers yielded no result, I was operating under the assumption that our enemies had better spying capabilities, meaning, they had the ability to arrange another ambush for her. </p><p>I was afraid that, even with forewarning, Titania lacked the personality to avoid a complicated ambush. She was in a habit of preferring direct solutions. I could only hope that without the constant interference from the source of her light magic forcing her to be emotionless and aggressive, she could be more cautious. </p><p>However, since I was already at the school, I decided to pay a visit to Aviada first. Even if Titania was going to be targeted, they would only do so after she properly exhausted herself, meaning I had at least half a day to visit her. </p><p>Visiting Aviada was important. She would probably be sent out for a mission as well, and unlike Marianne, she didn’t have the implicit protection of being a healer. As a front-line fighter, she was under tremendous risk, and several extra levels would come in handy. And after my interactions with the headmistress and the upcoming danger, revealing my leveling ability to Aviada wasn’t as dangerous. At this point, it was inevitable that it would be revealed sooner or later. </p><p>As another side benefit, I would be able to test whether the Companion progress was developing further. </p><p>I once again walked through the familiar corridors of the fighter section, easily slipping into the female dorm. Aviada was in her room, but she wasn’t alone. A familiar face was accompanying her, Carla, the sexy redheaded archer that had become the unwitting voyeur during our first encounter, before she evolved into a shy yet willing voyeur the last time. </p><p>Hard to believe it was just a few days ago, with everything that happened in between.</p><p>“Good evening, girls,” I said with a cheerful tone as I closed the door, barging in without even asking. Since it was Aviada’s room, it wasn’t rude, not that a little social nicety would have stopped me. </p><p>“Caesar,” they said immediately, Aviada with deep enthusiasm, but Carla’s tone was more shocked, no doubt remembering our last encounter, where I caught her masturbating while watching my private time with Aviada. </p><p>“So, how are you going in this fine evening?” I said even as I walked toward the bed, where Aviada was sitting, while Carla occupied a chair next to the bed. </p><p>“We’re discussing the mission for tomorrow,” Aviada answered. “We’re tasked to patrol the perimeter tomorrow, and Carla here is the squad head,” she added, just a touch </p><p>“Because you still think that direct violence is a solution for everything,” Carla countered exasperatedly, suggesting it wasn’t the first time Aviada had raised that exact topic. Not even close.  </p><p>“Well, she’s not wrong,” I said, which made Aviada sent an annoyed glare at me, but Carla didn’t have enough time to enjoy her small victory, too distracted by my movements as I pulled off my shirt, earning a strangled gasp rather than a smug acknowledgment. </p><p>“What are you doing!” Carla exclaimed. </p><p>“Undressing,” I said in a matter-of-fact tone. “Couldn’t your sharp ranger eyes decipher even that?” I said, then smirked. “We know that they can’t detect everything,” I added, referring to the time where I had fucked Aviada in front of her, all the while she was thinking Aviada was simply sitting on my lap, while bragging about the sharpness of her perception. </p><p>“That was-” Carla tried to argue as her face took a deep red color to match the hue of her hair, but interrupted by Aviada’s amused laughter. </p><p>“He got you there,” Aviada said simply, removing her top as well, revealing her perky breasts. Apparently, she wasn’t wearing anything underneath. </p><p>“Hey!” Carla said, her blush achieving the impossible as she watched Aviada’s uncaring nakedness. Though, since they used a communal shower, it was clearly more about the implicit action it was about to enable rather than simple nudity. </p><p>“What?” Aviada said even as I removed my pants and underwear on the background, and Carla shut her eyes. </p><p>“You’re both getting naked!” Carla answered, shocked that her objection wasn’t seemingly obvious for us. </p><p>“So,” Aviada shrugged even as I lay next to her, while she finished removing her clothes. “It isn’t like the first time you’re going to watch us having sex, is it? Or you can only handle watching while hiding in a corner like a coward, like all rangers.” </p><p>Aviada’s words were harsh, but from the way she uttered them casually, and Carla’s resulting blush and a lack of anger —except the frustrated, friendly kind— it was clear that it counted as banter to them. I might have attempted to judge them, but after watching Cornelia and Helga trying to one-up each other during a threesome that lasted hours, it wasn’t exactly extreme. </p><p>“It’s called patience and tactics, not that I expected a meathead that required her full intelligence to figure out how to swing a big sword to understand it,” Carla shot back, almost automatic, using the familiar grounds of the banter to </p><p>“Don’t judge your friend, sweetie,” I said even as I hugged Aviada’s waist. “She’s clearly feeling self-conscious, it’s not something to be mocked. We should understand that,” I said, which earned a quirked eyebrow from Aviada. Then, I grabbed the cover and pulled on us, hiding our bodies from her view. “Here, it’s done,” I said, my smirk widening even further. “You can surely handle it like this, right?”</p><p>“I don’t think she can,” Aviada jumped in before Carla could answer. </p><p>“Of course I can,” Carla answered rapidly, her pride overcoming her common sense. “You should be more concerned. Can you focus on our mission while you moan like a slut under his cock!” </p><p>“What can I say, he has a nice cock,” Aviada countered her, but before she could continue, my fingers found her entrance, caressing aggressively to moisten her entrance. Not that I needed to spend a lot of time doing that. The possibility of having sex in front of her friend was already doing wonders for her. </p><p>“So, about the patrol route,” Aviada said after a moan escaped her mouth while I lodged my shaft to the inviting embrace of her ass, enjoying the warmth of her plump curves. “What should be the role distribution?” </p><p>Carla replied with several names and their strengths and weaknesses, but Aviada wasn’t exactly in a point to give her all to listen to those words, occupied by the way my free hand landed on her breasts, teasing her nipples. The occasional moan that burst out informed Carla that her explanation wasn’t being listened to. </p><p>Not that Carla seemed torn about that particular fact. Even as she explained, her gaze was sliding repeatedly toward the blanket on the bed, or more accurately, the movement that gave a general idea of what was going on under it. She continued speaking, but it was more droning while her earlier shock slowly melted into desire and arousal. Her legs, subtly rubbing against each other, was another sign of her growing arousal. </p><p>“It sounds-” Aviada said once Carla finished her explanation, though the latter half of her explanation was mostly gibberish. I chose that exact moment to slip inside her, which extracted a delicious moan off her lips. “- nice,” she completed after her moan subsided. </p><p>“Really?” Carla said, amused at Aviada’s attempt to act like everything was normal, though that didn’t subtract anything from her growing arousal, her beautiful green eyes shining with desire. “I’m not sure about the third rotation, what’s your opinion on that?” she asked. </p><p>“Third rotation?” Aviada flinched, though, it might be more about me pushing my shaft even deeper into her wetness rather than the question. Still, that didn’t change the fact that she had clearly missed most of Carla’s explanation. “I agree with your plan completely.”</p><p>“Really?” Carla said even as she rotated on her chair to display her side to us, which was a subtle adjustment to hide the way her legs rubbing furiously, though it wasn’t successful as she was clearly thinking. “So, you don’t have any problem taking the rear guard both for second and third rotation,” Carla said smugly, saddling Aviada with the most annoying job during such a patrol, with lots of risks, but little actual excitement, responsible for defending the group for unexpected ambushes while they dealt with monsters.</p><p>It wasn’t the worst job in general, but with her personality, it was clearly the worst job for Aviada, forcing her to stay alert for the duration of the duty, but depriving her of the excitement of combat. For a combat junkie like Aviada, it was an excellent punishment. And the best part was that all Aviada needed to get out of it was to tell her she had made a mistake, but her pride would never allow her to do so. </p><p>That small jab had elevated Carla’s position in my mind a couple of ranks. She might be quite shy and a little perverted, but even in her distracted state, she was cunning enough to squeeze a little punishment despite her passive position. </p><p>Of course, her little victory might satisfy her mentally, but it was far from satisfying her physically as she watched Aviada’s face contorting with pleasure as I pushed deeper and deeper, the blanket moving violently. She could have beaten a hasty retreat, or accept her defeat with grace, but she did neither, her womanly pride blocking both paths. Instead, she decided to push back the only way she could, by messing with Aviada. </p><p>“Another question,” she said, trying to suppress the huskiness of her tone, before asking Aviada a detailed one about the team logistic, one that was actually forcing her to talk, biting her lips toward the end of the question. </p><p>“I’m not - SURE!” Aviada tried to answer, only to explode into a cry as I sank my fingers to her plump breast, enjoying the treatment. I listened to the rest of the explanation amusedly, using that to suppress a particular frustration. There was no progress in her Companion tracker, meaning, it was being sourced from the same source, cutting the second most important source of growth for me as well. </p><p>It meant that the power I had been giving to the girls had been coming at the expense of my own personal growth, with an unknown exchange ratio, or whether the different stages of the Companion process had different costs. I almost hoped that it did, because otherwise, I had wasted quite a bit of potential by spreading it half-completed across several targets rather than focusing on a few. </p><p>At least Helga and Cornelia had completed, giving me the permanent perks in the process. My life would have been much more inconvenient without the permanent Mana Regeneration, multiplying my combat potential significantly. </p><p>It wasn’t all bad, however, as the similarity between the Companion Process and the weird emotional suppressing aspect of Titania was rather similar. And since my Companions were powered with this so-called divine spark, chances were it was the same for Titania. Though, while having a strong clue was good, the destination it was pointing to was less so. After all, the headmistress already invited me to receive the ‘blessing’, meaning that the elusive item I was searching for was either in her possession, or she had a strong connection to someone that had it. </p><p>In either case, not the easiest target to pillage. </p><p>Aviada moaned loudly, interrupting my thoughts, which was a welcome interruption. “Sorry, I didn’t get that,” Carla said smugly. “Would you mind repeating it?” </p><p>“I said—” Aviada tried to say, but I squeezed her tits once more, cutting her explanation again. </p><p>“Really, Aviada,” Carla said gleefully, enjoying Aviada’s struggle as much as she was clearly enjoying the erotic aspects of our show. “You are almost strong enough to graduate, you should answer such a simple question easily,” she added, amusement dancing behind her beautiful green eyes. “I can’t even imagine the reaction of the instructors if you took this long to think during an expedition.” </p><p>“You’re pushing your luck—” Aviada answered, the pleasure making her needs too urgent to continue with their little challenge, but her argument got interrupted when I decided to change position, laying on my back before pulling her on, creating a delicious reverse cowgirl. Since it was time to change the pace, I let the blanket slip during the shift, revealing her delicious body, even as her weight pushed her down deeper onto my shaft. The change in the angle allowed my shaft to reach a different sensitive spot, which was the end of Aviada’s —admittedly halfhearted— attempts to chastise Carla. </p><p>To be fair, Carla wasn’t looked torn up about Aviada’s sudden silence, her eyes locked at our midsection, where my thickness was disappearing inside Aviada again and again. Her expression of arousal was unmistakable as she abandoned any attempt to keep it hidden. She just watched, her legs rubbing against each other as she tried to solve her own arousal, too self-conscious to actually start playing with herself in front of me. </p><p>A minute passed, the room slowly filling up with moans and grunts. Carla watched the way our bodies slammed against each other repeatedly without blinking, the last scraps of her resistance slowly disappearing under the strain… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 30    Experience: 447193 / 465000 </p><p>Strength: 41    Charisma: 53</p><p>Precision: 35    Perception: 37</p><p>Agility: 35     Manipulation: 40</p><p>Speed: 34       Intelligence: 44</p><p>Endurance: 34      Wisdom: 46</p><p>HP: 5370  / 5370\tMana: 6600  / 6600        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Master Subterfuge [97/100]         </p><p>Master Arcana [95/100]        </p><p>Expert Speech [70/75]</p><p>Advanced Craft [50/50]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 21/25]</p><p>[Helga - Level 17/21] </p>",

    "content": "<p>As the girls dashed away in the horizon, I faced against the second monster horde of the week, preparing to cut through even as I grabbed a disposable sword, my heartbeat quickening. I was about to delve into the belly of the beast, ready to meet the challenge. </p><p>However, it wasn’t going to be as easy, because the area-effect spells that I used to handle the previous horde were not available for me. While Iomene and the rest of the group had been dashing away, they weren’t far enough to miss a number of explosive fire spells illuminating the night sky. No, I had only one flashy option to use, and that was triggering the wards as an explosive, which would destroy the air gem unless I extract it from the mutated monster. </p><p>And even then, I was facing a time constraint, because Iomene and others would be expecting an explosion. Meaning, I had a couple of minutes at most to slip inside the monster horde, slay the mutated monster, and get away to trigger the explosion, getting rid of the rest of the horde in the process. I had to rely on my melee skill to achieve it, I realized even as I squeezed my dagger tightly, preparing to dash forward. </p><p>It wasn’t greed that motivated me to take the riskiest approach possible —well, not only greed. I wanted to test my melee skill to the limit while also developing some experience in the process. I wanted to test the true limits of my melee skill, which I had been neglecting due to my recent focus on magical abilities. It hadn’t been the worst of ideas as I had been discovering a new magical ability every single day, but with my leveling stalling —hopefully only a temporary setback— I needed to make sure I was using every single skill to their utmost limit. </p><p>Still, it didn’t change the fact that charging toward thousands of monsters, armed with only a knife —albeit a custom-designed magical one— didn’t look like a glorious suicide. </p><p>Rather than using arcana to sharpen the knife, this time, I decided to use the elemental mana, air in particular, using it to extend the cutting edge of my daggers. Running at full speed, I burst into a crowded mess of low-class monsters, only for them to turn into a neatly-sliced meat pile before they could react. </p><p>I was about to rush forward when I felt a shift in the wind, my reflexes allowing me to dodge the attack of a diving dire falcon before I could even process its presence. “Not bad,” I murmured as I analyzed my own reaction, trying to understand the reason. Yes, I had strong senses, but for some reason, it felt different. </p><p>I realized the reason after I dodged a few more assaults in the same manner. It was the airflow. To use air elemental on my daggers, I was constantly circulating the same type of mana in my body, and it seemed that it was granting me an instinctual connection with the airflow around me. It was such a nice surprise, as on the books I had never read something close to that, though, on second thought, it shouldn’t be a surprise. After all, how many elemental mages there were strong enough to connect with their surroundings in such an instinctual manner, yet had the physical capabilities and reflexes to leverage such a minuscule input. </p><p>“Come on, you bastards,” I murmured even as I dashed forward with a renewed enthusiasm, each slash taking the life of multiple creatures, leaving a deadly trail of blood behind. I received a wound here and there, but time was more important than staying untouched, and luckily, I had HP to spare. </p><p>[-196 HP]</p><p>I could feel the small nuggets of energy splitting from their presence, floating to nothingness as they failed to find purchase in my connection. What a waste, I thought before a wild thought entered my mind. I had a permanent connection with the girls, and maybe, I could use the connection as a conduit to transfer experience. It wasn’t particularly critical for Helga, as I could still use my own mana to boost her further, but Cornelia was about to hit the transfer limit. </p><p>I pulled my mana, once again guiding these nuggets of energy like I had done earlier, while hunting with Cornelia, but this time, pushing them through our connection rather than shoving them in her soul space. </p><p>“Perfect,” I murmured as I saw Cornelia’s experience counter stirring as I pushed the transfer. It wasn’t a perfect transfer. I could feel the nuggets losing a significant amount of power as they traveled through the connection, but it was significantly better than wasting all those kills —particularly so since I lacked the time to properly harvest anything. </p><p>With that done, I turned my attention toward the horde, dashing forward. However, as I moved deeper, facing against stronger monsters, I was glad that a monster horde was nothing more than a mindless crowd held together by hunger and madness, rather than a coherent strategic unit, because even with all my abilities, I wouldn’t have liked my chances if they were trying to anticipate my moves or surround me like the wild monsters usually did, their animal cunning enough to create a very dangerous threat. </p><p>I cut and sliced, driving toward the center of the horde, falling into a weird monotony as I did so in seconds, following the instincts provided by my melee skill. My body moved almost automatically at first, while I carefully observed the reactions of my own body, trying to learn from my own movements no matter how paradoxical and weird it felt. </p><p>As I moved forward, the sound of my own slices, the sprays of blood, cries of monsters all mixed together, creating a confusing blanket that prevented me from using sound as a source of alert despite my perception. Luckily, I had my new trick with elemental magic to help me cut through the mess. </p><p>I moved forward, like the calm center of the storm, displaying perfect control in a radius of two yards centered around me, killing any monster that dared to step in that distance with a calculated slash. With every blow, I could feel my movements getting noticeably smoother, something that was only possible through a combination of my agility and intelligence, creating a dangerous learning curve. In a minute filled with murder and danger, I could feel learning enough to surpass months of effort from the others. </p><p>The deeper I pushed, the faster I started to move, turning into a scythe of death despite having the form of a simple dagger. Identifying the location of the leading monster wasn’t too difficult, as the closer to the center, the more rabid the monsters become. </p><p>Even with my increasing skills, getting closer was not without its cost. I had to buy every step with gallons of blood, mostly belonging to monsters, though occasionally my own joined the crimson carpet that covered the ground. It had been barely a minute, but I was starting to feel like I had been fighting for an hour. </p><p>[-329 HP]</p><p>Then I finally found what I had been looking for in the form of a giant Elephant, one that looked remarkably like a normal one supposed to look like, though the way ground cracked under its feet with every stomp suggested otherwise —or its bloodshot eyes shimmering with power, but for reason, mini earthquakes were slightly more attention-grabbing. </p><p>I had prepared to rush toward it, only to barely realize my mistake before it was too late. The elephant rushed toward me with a surprising speed, reminding me that an air gem had been used to drive it crazy, and the constant flow of natured elemental mana had managed to transform its nature correctly. </p><p>I managed to throw myself away as it charged without touching me, but even the wind it created was enough to throw me away, not unlike a hurricane, killing a huge chunk of its own monsters in the process. Still, despite the incredible friendly fire it just caused, I had to respect the one who had selected that elephant as the target creature. Clearly, it was something around class eleven or twelve even before the transformation, and air gem not only increased that power several times, but also its elemental nature had turned the creature’s biggest weakness —its speed— into its greatest weapon. </p><p>Adding its surprise nature, I wouldn’t be surprised if it could break down the walls of the town before a proper response could have been mounted. </p><p>A dagger might be the worst weapon to actually challenge such a creature, bulky yet strong at the same time. Meaning, it was the perfect way to push my skills to the limit. </p><p>I decided to confront the monster directly, rushing toward it just as it managed to turn, swinging its trunk like a bludgeoning weapon, as quick as a storm. It wasn’t the only one that could use the power of the air, however, as I managed to dodge at the last moment, swinging my dagger to cut through the devastating wind it created, protecting me while the attack killed many monsters behind me. </p><p>“Too slow, big boy,” I said mockingly as I closed in the rest of the distance, and swung my dagger three times before it could attack again, turning its trunk into a useless, bleeding mess. It might be strong for a monster, but it was nothing against me. </p><p>The monster might have been maddened, but it maintained enough presence of mind to realize its most versatile weapon had been disabled, and tried to ram me with its tusks. It was just as quick as the previous assault, but this time, I was expecting its crazed rush. I waited until the last moment before jumping backward, using its momentum to cling into its body, and stabbing its head. </p><p>A crazed monster’s bone strength was near-unbreakable, but the former part of that statement was more relevant when its supposed untouchable was being challenged by a magical dagger with almost forty points of strength behind to support its assault. For all its thickness, neither its skin nor its bones prevented my dagger from slicing them like a hot knife through butter, allowing me to slide my hand and pull the gem. </p><p>After that, a point-blank spell delivered inside its skull destroyed its life utterly, leaving the rest of the monsters to roar in confusion. </p><p>I used that confusion to create an air elemental and beat a hasty retreat, though received a couple of wounds from confused monsters as I concentrated to create the elemental. Despite my increasing practice, creating such a complicated construct still took several seconds. </p><p>[-2142 Mana]</p><p>[-132 HP]</p><p> triggering the explosion of the wards the moment I was out of the confines. The explosion was spectacular, destroying most of the creatures in one attempt, while I strained to transfer all that experience to Cornelia, with rather spectacular results. Despite the huge loss during transfer, Cornelia still gained a level, and completing most of the transfer for the next one. </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 21/25 - 92%]</p><p>Pity I didn’t have time to get my reward. Even more annoying, I saw in my vision the familiar flickers of the light show that happened just before achievement, but it faded away before it was completed, indicating the lack of power. </p><p>“Fuck,” I murmured, annoyed by losing the benefits of another achievement. After losing all the riches such a big horde represented, losing the potential benefits of another achievement was rather annoying. I cursed loudly as I turned my attention toward the gem, trying to assess the chaotic spell that they had used to trigger the monster horde, but like before, it dispersed before I could get a decent read of the spell. </p><p>Maybe I should try to capture the next one alive, I thought, ignoring the inherent craziness of my thoughts, mad enough for other people to lock me up. But ultimately, the only difference between madness and genius was a success, and I had enough power to attain success under the worst of circumstances. </p><p>I sighed as I dismissed that particular track for the moment, and even if I could capture such a specimen live, I lacked a place to keep it. </p><p>I directed my mount toward Silver Spires at full speed, to have another strategy talk with my favorite librarian…</p><p>And maybe to spend some quality time if the opportunity allowed… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 30    Experience: 447193 / 465000 </p><p>Strength: 41    Charisma: 53</p><p>Precision: 35    Perception: 37</p><p>Agility: 35     Manipulation: 40</p><p>Speed: 34       Intelligence: 44</p><p>Endurance: 34      Wisdom: 46</p><p>HP: 4912 / 5370\tMana: 4201 / 6600        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Master Subterfuge [97/100]         </p><p>Master Arcana [95/100]        </p><p>Expert Speech [70/75]</p><p>Advanced Craft [50/50]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 21/25]</p><p>[Helga - Level 17/21] </p>",

    "content": "<p>It was a rush to see Nicole falling down to her knees just because I asked her to, in the middle of her living room, wearing nothing but a skimpy maid costume. The level of control she had surrendered in the last few days was simply unbelievable. </p><p>She said nothing after her initial half-hearted complaint, focusing on her task. She spread her legs wider to balance herself as she pulled down my shorts, allowing her skirt to ride even higher. It didn’t add much due to the current angle, but if anyone walked in the room, they would see her plump ass, under the limited cover of a g-string. She didn’t seem concerned in that, too occupied by the sight of my erection, throbbing aggressively </p><p>Her hands met at the base of the shaft, but she didn’t waste any time before grabbing the crown with her beautiful pillow lips, her tongue jumping on immediately. She didn’t push deep at first, but the enthusiastic pumping of her hands compensated for it, so I let her act to her heart's content for a while, enjoying the vibration of her soft moans. </p><p>However, I decided to change things a bit when her hands left their post, landing on my thighs to give her strength as she pushed deeper, swallowing half of it in one go. I put one of my hands through her beautiful brunette locks, leading her as she moved back and forth, while the other hand slipped down into her cleavage, cupping her breast. </p><p>That quickened her pace quite a bit as her head started pumping up and down, but she didn’t neglect to pull out occasionally to give an aggressive lick to the side, showing just how far she had come from her earlier passive acceptance. Not only all thoughts of denying me had a well-past, but also she was eagerly experimenting on new things. </p><p>She was such a good landlady. </p><p>Her desire intensifying with every passing second, Nicole clearly cared nothing but the cock sliding back and forth between her lips as she hungrily sucked with all the enthusiasm of a new housewife cleaning her house, making my shaft harder and harder as it slipped repeatedly through her moist lips. She obediently followed my directions as I pushed her deeper and deeper, grabbing my thighs tighter to push herself. </p><p>Meanwhile, her nipples had turned rock hard under my fingers as I treated myself with her soft breasts, stretching the costume more and more, not that I cared about much. It was already a miracle that it was able to resist Nicole’s curves. Moreover, if I wanted her to dress with that again, there were no problems making her wear a ripped costume. Not like it was going to stay on her for too long in any case. </p><p>But the real reaction came when I brought my foot to her crotch, the deficient cover of the g-string utterly unprepared to hold back her fire as it turned into a wet mess through her arousal. “Damn, you’re wet,” I commented, amused by the sudden blush it created. Apparently, sucking someone in the middle of her living room while wearing a maid costume that would have fit perfectly to a porn movie wasn’t as shameful as commenting on her arousal —like it was a secret in the first place. </p><p>However, that only made Nicole moan louder, which in turn made me groan as the vibrations traveled across my shaft. I started pushing my hips forward to match her greedy gobbling, once again probing her throat. She accepted the change of pace obediently, giving in to my control utterly, letting me guide her back and forth as I literally fucked her mouth, not neglecting her tongue movement even for a second. </p><p>I pulled my hand out of her bustier, instead grabbed my camera. “Smile,” I said as I took a few rapid photos, enjoying the way her eyes widened. “Don’t worry, they are for the private collection,” I reminded her, which managed to subtract the panic from her mood, leaving the only arousal it awakened. Her pushes quickened, enveloping my shaft with her throat, finally taking it all the way. </p><p>Then, she stopped, holding my shaft imprisoned in her throat as she gagged helplessly. “Damn, girl, you know how to keep your employer happy,” I commented as I groaned once more, getting closer to cumming, my cock twitching in a warning.</p><p>However, Nicole stayed in the same position, even when my cock twitched as a threat. Only when it started bursting with my climax, she pulled herself back, but kept the head in her mouth, catching all of it, not letting even a drop go to waste. Watching her hum as she caught my cum, treating it like a spectacular wine, was an amazing rush. “Excellent, now swallow,” I ordered, and she did so with great gusto. </p><p>“Amazing work,” I commented even as I made her turn and pushed down, until she was on all fours on the floor. It was the most appropriate way to spoil a maid, I decided. </p><p>She barely reacted as I caressed the inside of her legs briefly before pulling down her g-string, leaving her lips naked, though her moans rose immediately when my fingers easily slipped into her slit, her hips bucking at the sudden—but welcome—intrusion to her core. \"You’re so wet,\" I murmured as I steadily moved my fingers up and down, rubbing her clit in the process.</p><p>Nicole could do nothing but stand on all fours, trying not to collapse as her body eagerly accepted my treatment. The faster my fingers moved, the louder her moans become, steadily climbing toward a climax as she was being finger-fucked in the middle of her house. However, as I felt the first hints of clenching, I pulled my hand back. I didn’t want her climaxing under my fingers. </p><p>“What do you want, Nicole?” I asked even as I aligned myself to her entrance, ready to slam into her delicious expanse. “Tell me what you want?” </p><p>“I want your cock, sir,” she gasped loudly, her voice strained with arousal, but somehow still managing to stick into her role. Or maybe, it wasn’t. </p><p>“Good, but on one condition,” I said even as I pushed the crown into her entrance. “You’re going to promise that you’re going to dress better around the house. I don’t want to see you wearing frumpy sweatpants anymore. Instead, you’re going to wear short skirts, even tinier shorts, and anything that covers your delicious belly is forbidden.” </p><p>“But-” she started, only to receive a spank. “What about the girls?” she muttered. </p><p>“They are both adults, they can handle it,” I said, enjoying the desperation as she pushed her hips back, only for me to pull back. “Promise, or I leave you like this, panting and aroused.” </p><p>“Please, sir,” she gasped desperately while I caressed her ass lazily. </p><p>“No, you either dress better around the house, or we stop for the day.” I chuckled before continuing. “Be thankful that I’m not ordering you to walk around in lingerie.” </p><p>Her gasp of panic was delicious enough to tempt me to invade her, but I managed to wait until her surrender. “I agree, sir. Now, please, fuck me.” </p><p>“As you wish,” I said I pushed forward, finally treating myself to the warmth of her pussy, enjoying as she stretched for my girth. And as much as I wanted to grab her tits, dangling as I slammed inside her, my hands were once more occupied by my camera, taking photo after photo. There was something delicious in recording the way her back arched as I invaded her once more, this time in the middle of her living room, essentially completing my conquest. </p><p>She was mine, there was no doubt about that. </p><p>However, after a while, the dance of her tits got too attractive to deny, so I put the camera on the side —after switching it to movie mode, to create another exciting home movie— and let my fingers sink into the great expanse she had on display.  </p><p>“Oh, god, yes,” Nicole moaned, surprising me with her initiative. Usually, she was too shy to speak —which was an interesting juxtaposition, as she wasn’t too shy to be recorded while wearing transparent panties and being fucked— so the change was rather entertaining. “It feels amazing, fuck me harder,” she added, and since I was a gentleman, I quickened my assault. With the quivering brunette in front of me, it wasn’t exactly a chore. </p><p>“So, you want to cum,” I whispered even as I started spanking her ass. “Such a slutty whore,” I said even as I squeezed her ass. “Luckily for you, I’m a kind employer.” I caressed her spine gently, contrasting my aggressive pumping, which finally triggered her climax. </p><p>I pulled out, just enough to flip her, so that she was laying on her back, with only the carpet to soften the floor. I lifted her legs and plunged, so that her ankles were around my shoulder, forcing her to bend whenever I pushed. </p><p>I kept one hand on her tits, the other reaching for the camera. “Smile for the camera, sweetie,” I said even as I continued to pump inside her, and she was yet to process the aftermath of her initial shock. It was going to be normal sex, when I heard the sudden click of a door. I raised my gaze while a pair of shocked gasps reached my ear, one from Nicole… </p><p>One from Nancy… </p><p>They had a matching shocked expression on their faces, though luckily, neither could see the other thanks to the couch blocking Nancy from seeing parts of the carpet, including Nicole’s face. That was a dangerous moment, one that potentially ruined everything I had established here, but rather than making me fear, it made me even more aroused. “Play along,” I whispered to Nicole even as I grabbed her costume, pulling it up aggressively. It left her naked, but in exchange, it covered her most important part, her face. </p><p>“I can’t believe what are you doing in the living room,” Nancy gasped in shock as she walked closer, her red hair dancing in a way that reflects her fury. At this point, she was close enough to see Nicole’s face if it wasn’t for the costume covering her face. “You’re unbelievable.” </p><p>“Oh, hey, Nancy,” I said even as I grabbed my camera, still pointing at Nicole, taking photos. “Long time no see.” </p><p>“Long time no see,” she repeated, shocked, stalling for a moment. And her shock allowed me to focus on her dress, wearing a short skirt and a conservative top that nonetheless looked delicious on her fit body. The flashing anger in her eyes made it even better. “That’s all you can say?” </p><p>“What exactly you expect me to say,” I said even as I continued to pump into Nicole at the same pace. “I’m having a photoshoot here.” </p><p>“Photoshoot, that’s what you call it! You’re doing porn.” she gasped in shock, her green eyes flickering with fury, and no small amount of jealousy. “And stop fucking that slut.” </p><p>“No can do,” I answered. “And to your knowledge, we’re not doing porn, it’s just that my model was feeling a bit shy, so I’m helping her to relax.” </p><p>“Yeah, because that slut clearly needs relaxing,” Nancy said with a cutting tone, making Nicole whimper helplessly, but also made her tighten even more around my girth. “What do you think Nicole would say when she learns that,” she continued, which made Nicole relax just a bit, ensuring that she wasn’t being recognized yet despite her recognizable hair and body type. </p><p>Apparently, for Nancy, such a possibility was so unlikely that it wasn’t even worth considering. </p><p>“Sure, go ahead,” I said with a smirk. “I look forward to having a discussion with Nicole about how I treat my models.” I watched them smugly as both women reacted that in their own way, thinking that the target was themselves. Nancy sputtered a bit, then I smirked wider. “And, are you really the best one to talk about the sanctity of the living room,” I added, subtly reminding her of the naughty times we experienced on the couch, when I caught her watching porn. </p><p>“That’s different,” she immediately replied as her arms wrapped around her body, as if she was trying to cover herself. Meanwhile, Nicole tightened significantly, to the point of making me suspect whether she had another secret side as an exhibitionist. But that was something to be tested under less sensitive circumstances.  </p><p>“Really, how?” I said, but when she didn’t answer, I let it slide. As much as it was a rush to mock Nancy while fucking Nicole in front of her —though she was unaware of her identity— I was pushing my luck. Any moment, Nancy could recognize Nicole, or she could say something that would inform Nicole that she wasn’t the only beauty I was tasting in the house. “Anyway, feel free to stay and watch, your presence is doing wonders for her shyness,” I said, reminding Nancy that, in her arousal, she was effectively watching a live erotic movie. </p><p>“You’re a pig!” Nancy replied with a shout as she dashed back toward the door. “I’ll be back in an hour, make sure you finished with that whore, or I’ll tell Nicole!” </p><p>With that last threat —and a completely ineffective one considering Nicole’s current position— Nancy left the house. Only then, Nicole dropped the costume. “Well, that was exciting,” I said mockingly even as I started taking photos. </p><p>“We need to stop,” she gasped, though she didn’t make any move to actually do so. </p><p>“Really? Why?” I said. “She’s already gone, what’s the harm in finishing. Or do you really want to stop without cumming once more?” </p><p>That last part effectively cut her complaints. “Can’t we just go to my bedroom,” she begged. </p><p>“No,” I said. “Not when I’m this close to cumming. She stayed silent, and I took it as an opportunity to turn on the intensity, the sound of hips slamming filling the room. “You want to cum, don’t you?” I asked.</p><p>“I want to cum!” she moaned after a moment of silence, the temptation of the pleasure overwhelming the mortification she had just experienced. Not to mention, she was panting helplessly. </p><p>“Do you want me to cum inside?” I asked. </p><p>“Yes,” she moaned. “Please, fill me in!” </p><p>I smirked like I had just got an idea. “Then, why don’t you wrap your beautiful legs around me and pull me deeper, so that I can properly fill you?” </p><p>She said nothing, not that she needed to when her plump legs curled around my waist, slowly pulling me deeper inside her. Drunk with pleasure, she just moaned helplessly while I found myself imprisoned inside her, which finally triggered a climax. “Yes,” she moaned deliriously as her legs turned into prison bars, imprisoning me inside her as I burst forth… </p>",

    "content": "<p>My bet with Emma had concluded with her loss. Luckily for her, my promise to reveal the identity of spies was not conditioned to her victory, only her participation. Unluckily for her, I hadn’t promised to stop once the bet was concluded. </p><p>“So, Emma,” I murmured after Aria pulled away from the kiss, watching as my seed was slowly slipping out of Emma while my shaft was still inside her, trying to recover after its latest exertion. “Did you enjoy the cost of defeat?” </p><p>“You’re an evil man,” she replied, which would have been an effective admonishment if it wasn’t for the pleasure still coloring her tone, or the way her hips rocking absentmindedly like she was trying to milk the last scraps possible. It was an even better reaction than I had expected, suggesting that she had been affected more than I presumed during the memories I had made her watch during her ill-advised attempt to read my memories, in particular the relationship between me and the Valkyrie. </p><p>“Really,” I said with a snort. “You’re the first person that ever called me that. Evil, how inconceivable,” I said, which earned an earnest laugh from Aria, who was watching the way my body was connected with Emma in a mixture of desire and jealousy. </p><p>“Shut up,” Emma countered, blushing despite her terse tone. “You know what I meant.” </p><p>“Oh, I know what you mean,” I said. And since my body was already recovering after the last climax, I followed that by grabbing her waist and lift her up, only to slam her down back again. Still feeling sensitive after the last encounter, she cried in pleasure. </p><p>“The deal is over,” she said as she moaned. “Now, tell me about the spies.” </p><p>I had to admit, the fact that she could keep her eyes on the prize despite circumstances was admirable. After our first time, Aria had folded completely to her new role, accepting the treatment happily. “Sure, let’s start,” I said. Unfortunately for her, I had no intention of keeping that as dry information delivery. So, even as Emma finally stood up from my lap, I gestured Aria to sit down on the floor, and part her legs. </p><p>Aria followed my request, but not before bending down to grab her dress to create a comfortable seat. “She has a nice ass, doesn’t she?” I asked Emma, whose eyes were locked at the sight of Aria’s tantalizing ass, the current pose displaying it to perfection. Emma’s jealousy was understandable. She was a beautiful woman, but Aria was unbeatable from that particular angle. The fact that her core was still oozing my seed, reminding Emma about her second-string situation, made it even more heated. </p><p>Distracted by her jealousy, Emma watched as Aria prepared herself a comfortable cushion before sitting down, missing as I cast a telekinesis spell to pull her dress in front of Aria, creating another comfortable seat. Then I pushed her. She let out a cry, preparing herself for a painful fall, but I grabbed her waist, preventing that ignoble event from occurring. She was too beautiful to bruise carefully, after all. </p><p>“What was that!” Emma cried as she found herself in all fours. She tried to stand up, only to realize that was a difficult task to achieve with my hand pressing between her shoulder blades, pinning her in place. </p><p>“Well, you’re still responsible for poor Aria’s plight, after all.” </p><p>“And what do you want me to do about that,” she bit back even as I pressed my erection against her entrance. I was amused to note that she didn’t make the slightest attempt to pull back, too occupied by her outrage. Anger was one of my favorite emotions on others, especially the bright and explosive kind like Emma had. It made it much easier to manipulate them. </p><p>“Simple, help her clean up the results of my little intrusion,” I said even as I pushed inside her, easily sliding into her well-lubricated entrance. </p><p>“No-” she cried in anger, but that statement was cut short when Aria gave another uncharacteristic show of independence, and grabbed Emma’s beautiful red hair, using it as a painful handle to bury her face between her legs. </p><p>“Good work,” I said, followed by a thumbs up. It was a rather amusing display of approval, one that hardly fit into the circumstances, but for someone as starved for explicit positive approval, it worked even better than a more thematic approach. Aria smiled back cutely even as she pulled Emma’s head tighter, trying to extract the desired in a surprisingly forceful manner. “Try ordering her,” I reminded her. </p><p>“Really? That works?” Aria gasped even as I plunged deep into Emma, who was trying to keep her balance despite her lack of leverage, keeping her mouth pressing against Aria’s core. Emma tried to contradict, but due to her position, all that left her mouth was an indecipherable murmur, one that made Aria moan. “Lick it,” she said, though it felt more like a question than an order. </p><p>I sighed. “Not like that, you need to be more confident. You’re not kindly requesting something. You’re her princess, and you’re giving an order. Make it sharper, otherwise, she won’t follow your order,” I explained, underlining my statement with a spank on Emma’s bottom, earning a cry, and leaving a red mark behind. “And a sexy insult wouldn’t go amiss under this particular circumstances, though I don’t recommend to replicate in the throne room.” To make things even more fun, I was still impaling her furiously, leveraging the position to the limit, yet somehow, both girls accepted it as a natural part of the situation. </p><p>Emma tried to complain about Aria’s overreach, but Aria’s tight grip prevented her from doing so. “Lick it … you whore,” Aria murmured, her eyes closed as she focused on her words. </p><p>“Not bad,” I said, nodding approval. “It didn’t sound like a question, and the choice of insult was workable.” Then, I slapped Emma’s ass. “Did you hear that, whore?” I said with mocking laughter, but still sounding much more commanding than Aria could ever achieve. “Your princess gave you an order. Lick.” </p><p>A spank landed on her ass even as Aria kept her head pressing against her core, then another… And another… “Lick, you bitch,” Aria ordered repeatedly after each spank, her tone getting more and more confident through repetition. Emma seemed determined to resist, but I decided to cheat a bit. </p><p>Even as I continued to pump into her furiously, I cast a quick spell, the same that I used to give commands to Aria without being noticed by Emma, only in reverse. “You better follow the order of your princess if you want to hear about those spies. My tongue will stay tied as long as yours stay immobile,” I warned her. The threat of wasting all of her other sacrifices finally broke her stubbornness, and her tongue darted out, licking Aria’s nether lips, still stained with my cum. </p><p>Her movements looked unimaginative and repetitive, but that didn’t prevent Aria from moaning in joy. I wasn’t particularly surprised about that. The way the human mind worked, especially during sex, was rather predictable. Physical pleasure played an important yet overrated role, while the real pleasure came from a complicated ball of power dynamics and expectations. And Emma’s tongue might move mechanically, but for Aria, it was the first time she was striking out of her role as the meek princess, signaling her achievements and developments. Her joy was expected. </p><p>The same applied to me as well. Emma was a delicious beauty, but I doubted I would enjoy dominating her to such a degree if I hadn’t had the vivid memories of her fire spells burning the castle I had spent so much time decorating, playing not an insignificant role in dismantling the dominion that took years to assemble. Luckily for her, I wasn’t like my predecessors, who would have done their best to torture and kill her for doing so, but I wasn’t a saint that would just write it off either. </p><p>Turning her into a toy that was addicted to my cock was a happy medium. </p><p>Distracted by the fact she was licking the slit of another woman —and one that she clearly disdained as a weakling, to make it more fun— Emma barely paid attention to the way her body was reacting to my repeated invasion, her reflexes leading her hips to move in a heavenly circular motion, supporting the rhythm of my invasion. Her instincts didn’t care about her reputation as the foremost offensive mage of the Empire. I started telling her about the spies, but I doubted she could memorize all information perfectly while she was under the combined assault of pleasure and stress. </p><p>Luckily for her, I was a cooperative partner, and would refresh her memory about it if asked … for a price, of course. </p><p>And, Emma wasn’t the only one that was struggling under the unfamiliar grasp of pleasure. Aria had long lost herself in pleasure, her voice surprisingly loud as she pulled one hand away from Emma’s hair, squeezing her own breasts, leveraging her sensitivity to push toward another climax. Meanwhile, her other hand stayed around Emma’s hair, pulling and pushing recklessly —well, recklessly in her kind princess standard, the same amount of force would be classified as kind if deployed by anyone else— enjoying her newfound power on Emma. </p><p>For the first time, I could properly see her familiarity with the Queen other than their beauty. </p><p>I couldn’t delve into Emma’s mind without alerting her about the whole scheme, which was a pity as I was curious about her exact thoughts, whether frustration or pleasure was ruling her mind. Though, if I were betting with someone, I would have selected denial. She had the perfect mixture of hotheadedness and blind confidence to convince herself that it was just a temporary setback, one that she could resolve once she pilfered my secrets. I wouldn’t be surprised that with her misplaced confidence about her abilities in the mind arts, she believed she could scour those humiliating memories from our minds. </p><p>I had no problems with such illusions. In due time, I would enjoy breaking them one by one, once she got addicted to the temptation of pleasure. </p><p>“Lick harder, whore, that’s all you’re good for,” Aria moaned as she finally climaxed, cumming furiously. As the pleasure invaded her body, she pulled Emma tighter, breaking me from my absentminded musings, unaware just how Emma stiffened under her domination, ready to lash out. It seemed that Aria’s reckless enjoyment finally broken her desire for obedience. I could even feel her magic starting to gather —a particularly easy task when I was lodged deep inside her. </p><p>“Pay attention to your partner, sweetheart,” I warned Aria even as I slapped Emma’s ass. “Dominating a redheaded slut is never a straightforward affair. You need to pay attention to their movements, they might react violently.” </p><p>Aria reacted just like an overenthusiastic nerdy student that received a subpar review from her favorite professor, a shocked flinch, combined with an immediate fervor to do better, even when she was still dealing with the aftereffect of her climax. “Sorry,” she uttered, while Emma’s magical fluctuations paused after being challenged openly. </p><p>“No need to apologize,” I said magnanimously, which made Emma even angrier at being dismissed, her magic starting to gather once more, more as a pointless threat than an actual danger, as it was rather hard to ignore such a threat without actually integrating the other aspects of their game. “You just need to be careful, either don’t push them too much…” I said, then let my voice linger even as I grabbed Emma’s hair, pulling it much harder than Aria did, making her moan. More importantly, I used my own mana to dispel her spell construct, making her harmless. It was a novel trick, one I had designed during the early days of my imprisonment as a part of my efforts to reverse-engineer the magic-blocking shackles. </p><p>It wasn’t as useful as those artifacts, as it came with several drawbacks. In particular, it was completely useless for combat. Not only it required constant attention, but also required a direct physical connection to enable direct mana transfer, and at that point, a slice of the dagger was much more efficient to deal with an enemy combatant. Maybe I could improve it further after some more experimentation, but currently, it had no place on the battlefield.  </p><p>However, in the bedroom —or many other places I was having sex— it was the perfect trick to pull to destroy the confidence of an uppity mage. “Or make sure they know that they have no chance of fighting back. Under your power, they are helpless,” I said lazily, enjoying Emma’s shocked gasps. The sudden loss of her casting abilities had been shocking. She might not be planning to use her abilities for battle, but still, the loss of them meant she had suddenly lost her security blanket. </p><p>And it affected her profoundly. Earlier, even when she was being pounded mercilessly while being ordered around to serve Aria, her confidence stayed strong, believing that she could extract herself if things got too bad. It didn’t come from the rational side of her brain, as she knew that in close quarters against me, without the support of a carefully assembled party, she had absolutely no chance to resist me. But subconsciously, her magic gave her confidence… </p><p>A source of confidence that I broke completely. </p><p>“That’s not possible,” she moaned as her gaze slid toward the magic-blocking chains on the wall, like she was trying to convince herself that they were still in place. </p><p>“You see, Aria,” I said even as I pounded her mercilessly. “To dominate someone properly, you need to force them to face reality. Only by accepting the truth of their situation, they could fully give themselves to their new position in life.” </p><p>“Please,” Emma gasped, delirious in panic. “Give back my magic.” If she had been in a better state of mind, she wouldn’t have missed that such a trick was most likely to be an essentially useless temporary trick, otherwise, I would never reveal it under such circumstances. </p><p>“You see,” I said to Aria, ignoring Emma’s pleas as I quickened my assault. “Even a proud slut like Emma could fold easily if you have the ability to push the correct spot,” I explained, before pushing her head down once more, burying her face between Aria’s plump thighs. “Lick it, bitch, and convince me that you’re doing your best.” </p><p>Emma moaned in approval before she launched another assault through her tongue, this time her slurping aggressively loud. “I - I see,” Aria said, unable to prevent a shocking moan at the sudden change of pace. </p><p>“Do you love it, bitch?” I asked Emma when I let her rise enough to catch her breath, while I plunged as deep as possible. “Do you love acting like a two-bit whore just to extract a few useless nuggets of information?” </p><p>“Yes,” she moaned helplessly, but despite her desperation, the echoes of pleasure were just as clear. However, a better evidence of her newfound sense of obedience was the sudden tightening of her entrance, tightening around my girth, finally triggering my climax as well, painting her insides with a fresh layer of whiteness. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said even as I continued to pump inside her lazily. My initial plan was to let them go, but Emma’s newfound obedience was too delicious to waste. Or maybe, I should let her go to properly process her total surrender, which would make the next day —or an evening visit if I was feeling particularly randy— much more entertaining… </p><p>Decisions… Decisions… </p>",

    "content": "<p>I was tempted to let out an appreciative whistle as I watched Theodora shedding the rags she had been wearing, revealing her pristine skin underneath, the light olive tone adding an exotic taste for my viewing pleasure. After living all my life in the north, her tastefully tanned looking was a sip of freshwater. </p><p>No wonder the slavers never punished her even after she tried to escape. While the slavers were cruel —sometimes needlessly— even a semi-successful one like the ones that had captured me was aware of the value of such a beautiful slave, and her upper-class upbringing just enhanced her value further. Even the slightest wound would have reduced her market value significantly. </p><p>My mouth started to water as she freed herself from the oppression of her shirt, revealing her tits, perfectly sized to fill my palm with no excess, exquisitely perky. I bit my lips to not to make any noise even as I made a show of browsing the documents on the flimsy desk, while I kept my eyes firmly on the mirror, watching as her loose pants went down, revealing her stunning legs, toned to perfection. Apparently, the slavers gave her the baggiest clothes they had to limit her attractiveness, but with a limited effect. </p><p>She tried to fix her hair before she pushed her underwear down. Normally, it should have been an unimportant detail, but things changed when it caused us to make eye contact through the reflection in the mirror. She let out a cute gasp as she wrapped her arms around her chest, her face blushing immediately. “No,” she gasped in shock. </p><p>I just smirked as I turned to look at her, wearing only her bulky underwear, her arms hugging her body tightly, unaware of the popping effect it created with her breasts. “Sorry, I shouldn’t have peeked through the mirror,” I said with an exaggerated apology, which sounded sincere, but considering I was actually facing her while she wore almost nothing, it wasn’t particularly effective. I might have actually pulled back if she had shown any hint of actual panic or trauma, but the cute blush she sported told me a different story. </p><p>She said nothing, waiting for me to turn back, but I decided to tease her a little, and not because I wanted to see her naked body —at least, not just that— but due to a desire to test her attitude a little. She had just declared that she wanted to work with me, and before I could reveal any secret to her, I needed to know more about her personality. </p><p>Teasing her under the circumstances might not be the best choice, but it was certainly a fun choice. </p><p>“W-will you turn your back?” she stammered after a minute, the hesitancy adding a beautiful cadence to her musical voice. </p><p>“Sure, if you want me to turn back,” I said with a smirk, suddenly twisting the narrative. She froze at my words, realizing the implied subtext. </p><p>“I…” she started, only for her voice to fail midway, her noble upbringing fighting against the rush of emotions she had been feeling. The attack and the rescue were confusing enough without suddenly introducing a sexual angle to our little game, but I was certainly selfish enough to put that on the table if she wanted to use me as a shield for whatever trouble she was escaping from, to a point that she preferred to stay with a complete unknown like me rather than trying to make her way back to her family —if she had any remaining family. </p><p>“You…” I said as I crossed my arms in a way that mirrored hers, making her blush even harder. </p><p>However, her overwhelmed state didn’t last long, self-control exerting itself once more. At that point, I expected her to kindly ask me to stop teasing her, and prepared to turn, which was why her words surprised me greatly. “N-no touching,” she stammered, her blush getting even thicker. </p><p>“As you wish, princess,” I mocked her, only for her to flinch at the last word. It wasn’t a big flinch, almost impossible to catch in the dimness of the tent, and she managed to hide it almost immediately, but my senses were too sharp to miss that. Maybe I shouldn’t have focused on that, but after several days that passed without the gentle touch of a beautiful woman —especially after I got used to a very busy schedule thanks to Lillian and Astrid’s enhanced libido and competitive nature— I was more interested in the way her arms fell on the side, once again revealing her spectacular breasts to my gaze. </p><p>She said nothing, her momentary flinch superseded by the way she took a step forward, a simple yet elegant move that could be only possible through years of dance training. The step made her breasts jiggle just enough for my mouth to water. I sat on a nearby crate, watching as she turned to the side before pushing down her underwear, partially revealing her perky ass while hiding her core from the view. </p><p>As I watched her, I could feel my body heating up, my instincts flaring once more. </p><p>After living with them for more than half a year, I didn’t want to call them foreign instincts anymore. As I got used to them, I was having an easier time controlling the urgency they created, begging for me to step forward and dominate the naked beauty in front of me, but that didn’t reduce the burning desire it awakened. </p><p>The bodily reaction it created was noticed by Theadora, whose gaze locking into the tent in front of my pants, informing her about my impressive size. Her blush intensified even further. She reached for the clean clothes she was about to change —a bunch of clothes designed for men— but she stalled after grabbing the bulky underwear. I watched as she watched my shaft hesitantly, like she was trying to decide something, but unfortunately, her sense of propriety won over her desire and hero worship. </p><p>Still, it wasn’t without a benefit, as she was rather slow as she pulled them on, almost in a caressing manner, displaying her legs for the maximum effect even as she hid them behind the coarse cloth, doing it with such a sheer eroticism that forced me to adjust my pants to save me from the obstructive tightness. After pulling that on, she grabbed the shirt, facing me as she pulled that on with deliberate slowness, as if she was trying to pay back for my heroics, though her gaze dropping down for my bulge suggested that she was also feeling the effects of arousal. </p><p>I was tempted to pull my pants down to give her the full view, but despite the temptation, I held back, even when she gave me a pouty smile as she slowly buttoned up her shirt as she walked around in the room, her hips swaying temptingly. </p><p>“That’s a nice show,” I said lazily as she was halfway in putting up the shirt, hiding her breasts, but still with a large cleavage. “But you can never hide like that,” I added. “You’re too beautiful to pass as a man, and even if you did, I doubt it would protect you from ending in the bed of an aggressive noble.” </p><p>Her blush was spectacular. “What should I do?” she asked. </p><p>“Come here,” I said, patting my knee. She was hesitant as she walked toward me, excitement battling with trepidation, her expression actually making it harder for me to resist the temptation, but somehow, I managed to do so even as she perched on my lap. </p><p>“Are you going to cast a spell to disguise me?” she asked. “That won’t work, not when I’m trying to enter the city. </p><p>“I know,” I answered with a shrug. “That’s an amateur’s way,” I said, once again remembering my grandfather’s lessons. My training wasn’t as detailed in the area of disguise and other trickeries, but still, it included some crash-course details. The most important being my grandfather’s disdain toward the more magical tricks, actually turning your disguise into a lighthouse for any sufficiently sensitive mage. </p><p>Instead, I pulled the bag of makeup I found in the tent, which surprised me with their quality until I remembered they were actually in the business of selling people, which meant the better their merchandise looked, the more money they could make. </p><p>“Let’s make you ugly,” I said with a smirk even as I wrapped my arm around her waist, pulling her closer, though still half an inch away from my erection, her naked legs trembling in excitement. I dipped the brush on the concealer, and started caressing her chin, trying to add some clunky shadows that would ultimately look like the early stages of a patchy beard. However, rather than adding a thick layer directly, which would have worked perfectly, I added the thinnest layer possible. </p><p>Why keep it short when I had such a beautiful girl on my lap, with the sight of her beautiful cleavage just a bonus. </p><p>However, as much as I enjoyed her tight ass pressing against my thigh, it wasn’t the only reason to tease her. No, since she declared that she wanted to help me —and doubtlessly use me for her protection at the same time— I wanted to test her. Honestly, despite her beauty, if it wasn’t for her honest dismay when she accidentally triggered the string of the events that caused me to get captured, I wouldn’t have accepted despite the information potential she represented. “So, you want to help me,” I stated even as I caressed her face gently with the brush. </p><p>“Yes,” she answered, losing her stammer immediately at the mention of a more serious topic, though the same didn’t apply to the frustrated arousal that colored her face. “I can help you navigate the upper class of Rome.” </p><p>“That’s a nice offer,” I murmured. “And no doubt, using my help to get away from whatever disaster you’re trying to get away,” I added.</p><p>“N-no-” she tried to argue, her stammer immediately back, but I cut her off my tightening my grip around her waist, though considering just how low my hold was, it was more erotic than punishing. </p><p>“Don’t panic, that’s understandable,” I countered, calming her down. “It’s only fair that we’re both benefiting from each other. I wouldn’t want you to work for me just because I have saved you through a lucky break,” I said, which was a little trick. I wouldn’t have rejected her help even if she had been doing it for sheer kindness, but there was no harm in some fake generosity.</p><p>“Thanks,” she murmured, losing some of her tensenesses, even when I let my hand slide lower, comfortably resting at the small of her back, adding some more intimacy to the situation. </p><p>“So, what do you have in mind next?” I probed, curious about the way she would think rather than the plan itself, ignoring the throbbing of my shaft, or her aroused trembling.  </p><p>“The best way to establish myself in Rome,” she murmured. “They don’t have a lot of riches, but if I could get in the city, I could rent a small estate on the outskirts, playing the role of a young daughter of a minor noble, trusted by her father to set up a small trade business. That way, you could help ” </p><p>I shook my head. “That wouldn’t work very well, with the reputation as a merchant,” I said. It was one of the weird quirks I never understood about society. For some reason, merchants were treated in disdain even when they got incredibly rich, severely curtailing their potential to enter the high society, a place that I needed to enter. </p><p>“I know,” she answered. “But I don’t have a lot of options, not without enough money to spread around, and maybe bribe a couple of officials.” </p><p>“Hmm,” I murmured, trying to gain some time while considering the merits of giving her some of the hard-earned loot I had gathered while hunting back in the mountain. They consisted of a range of rare magical reagents, and represented a lot of money —not to a point of rivaling the net worth of a lower-rung noble family, but enough to fake being one for a few months if one being smart enough. While it was early to trust her with such a significant wealth, my decision to go undercover as a gladiator made it ill-advised to bring them with me into the city in the first place. The slavers missed the significance of the bag, but I wasn’t willing to risk the same for the gladiator school. </p><p>I expected them to be smarter than a bunch of slavers. </p><p>I could either bury them in the countryside, or give some of them to her, risking her possible disappearance. With a full purse, backing me in a dangerous scheme would inevitably be less attractive. However, before I could make a decision, she shuffled in her place, her naked thigh rubbing against my bulge, making it throb with excitement. I could have ignored that as an accident, but she repeated the same again a couple of seconds later. “You seem uncomfortable. Is there anything I can do to help?” </p><p>“Nothing,” she murmured, then her blush bloomed a little as her eyes slid down. “Isn’t it uncomfortable?” </p><p>“The tightness of the pants, or my erection itself?” I asked, amused. I would have given her points for an excellent attempt of manipulation, but with my hand pressing against her back, I could easily sense her out-of-control heartbeat, spiking as she brushed against my shaft. And while it was possible to fake expression, the same didn’t apply to bodily reactions. Maybe it was the hero worship, or maybe it was just that she hadn’t experienced such closeness with a man before, but regardless of the reason, she was showing clear signs of attraction. </p><p>“The first one,” she answered with a rapidness that betrayed that she wanted to answer the alternate. </p><p>While I had decided not to push her more under the circumstances, to respect her possible stress as well as considering the time pressure of the circumstances, but her words were making resisting her rather difficult. “A bit,” I said. I was tempted to pull it down to sit more relaxed manner as well as treating her to a nice sight, but I was afraid that if I did that, things devolve to a point that would occupy me until the first rays of morning. So, rather than pulling down my pants to follow her invite, I changed the subject. “Actually, I have an alternative idea,” I said even as I summoned my backpack, and flicking open the secret compartment. “What if you had some decent funds to start with.” </p><p>“That would be much more convenient. With this, I can rent a decent estate that’s worthy of a foreign noble that’s trying to penetrate into the polite society. It wouldn’t give results immediately as people of Rome don’t hold the foreigners in high esteem, but still, much better than a merchant,” she said immediately as she examined the contents, though I noted the absolute lack of awe on her face. It was clear that it wasn’t the first time she was holding a fortune in her hands, which, combined with her earlier reactions, suggested that she was coming from a much richer family. Combined with her reaction to the word princess, I was starting to suspect that she belonged to one of the small independent kingdoms between the Republic and the Empire. That, or one of the city-states that still maintained their nominal independence. </p><p>“That would be nice,” I said, approving her decision. After that, despite the sensual aura in the air, we discussed some of the vital details of the plan —or more accurately, Theodora explained while I listened, as I didn’t have the sufficient knowledge to assist her decision-making, and didn’t trust her to actually trust her on my actual objective. She just knew that I needed to access some patrician estates, and nothing else. As we discussed, I helped her to finish dressing, buttoning up her shirt by my hands as well as finish applying the disguise make up —and solidifying it with magic— so that she could pass for an effeminate man for a few days, giving her the opportunity to arrange her guard and other vital components. </p><p>After that, I helped her to choose a horse, which was untouched in their pasture as the other slaves I had freed were too focused on escaping to actually steal anything from the camp, afraid that they might wake up the guards. “Be careful,” I said as I squeezed her hand. </p><p>“I should be saying that to you,” she answered with a smile that tried to look brave, but flickered nonetheless. “The Colosseum is a dangerous place, and with the wards, you can’t rely on your magic to survive there. Be careful.” </p><p>“As you wish, milady,” I said, giving an exaggerated bow before sending her off, before I turned my attention back to the camp. I needed to set up a few things to create a compelling story for the slavers. Luckily, I already had the most critical component for it. </p>",

    "content": "<p>The girls dashed toward the outskirts of the camp after they fully activated the ward, covering the camp with a flickering dome of crimson energy, ready to destroy any creature that slams to it. Meanwhile, I climbed on top of a large rock, shadows around me erasing me from the view with the help of a nifty little trick I had embedded into the secondary wards, hiding me from the monsters and people alike. </p><p>And it immediately proved to be a good choice, because the first thing I had noticed was a huge horde of monster —several times bigger than the one I had taken down during our nighttime adventure with Cornelia— chasing Iomene and the rest of the students. </p><p>“Damn, she’s good,” I said even as I watched Iomene dashing fast enough to keep up with the other two students —one of the ranger students was absent— who had been using their fastest speed, their faces red with exertion, their weapons and backpacks abandoned. Iomene, on the other hand, not only still had her backpack and her weapons, but also she had her bow in hand, releasing an arrow smoothly whenever a flying monster pulled off from the group, either directly killing it if the monster was weak, or targeting a soft spot like an eye or a wing tendon to slow them down if it was a stronger monster. </p><p>She was impressive when she stretched her abilities to the limit. Also, I was finally seeing the magical features of her bow being displayed after she run out of arrows, sending glowing bolts of energy rather than physical arrows. “Interesting,” I murmured as I tried to decipher the magical nature of the arrows, but failed to do so. The distance was a factor in that of course, but still, I could have detected it easily if it was some kind of elemental or arcana trick. </p><p>“Interesting,” I murmured, my curiosity awakening. Unfortunately, as the monster horde closed in, I didn’t have time to pay attention to her, no matter how interesting her weapon was, my attention switching to the nature of the horde. </p><p>The horde was several times bigger than the one I had taken down before, the dust cloud they create threatening to drown the horizon. It was clear that, unlike the previous horde I had taken down, it had a chance to grow. Still, the sheer numbers weren’t exactly a threat to a well-fortified town. </p><p>Unfortunately, the real problem was the composition of the horde. As usual, most of the monsters were the low-class ones, but still, it had enough creatures above Class Ten —hundreds, as far as I could detect with a glance. The defensive structures of the town could probably hold them for a couple of days, but unless the high-level monsters were taken down quickly, they would eventually result in a breach. </p><p>It was a smart approach, I realized as I saw the presence of the horde. After our breach had told them their attack was no surprise anymore —while simultaneously destroying a majority of their cannon fodder in the process— apparently, they decided to follow an extended campaign. And monster hordes were the perfect weapon to be used for that, especially since they just triggered and directed the monsters, rather than actually commanding them. </p><p>I suspected that their initial aim was to use them as a blunt instrument against the defenses of the school before following up with their undead army, creating layered chaos, but honestly, their current strategy was better, forcing the school to disperse their forces to defend their supporting towns, exposing the high-level combatants in the process. </p><p>It was a sure bet that this horde wasn’t their only weapon. </p><p>“Such an interesting method of warfare,” I said even as I frowned. Humanity was already struggling to survive against the ever-growing threat of monsters, a careful reading of the history displaying the negative trend swallowing more and more cities, pushing humanity back despite all the advantages given by the System. And now, a bunch of nobles decided that the loss of even more cities was just an incidental loss in their struggle for power, potentially destroying the most important school for raising combatants in the process. </p><p>With a mentality like that, it was shocking that humanity had managed to survive until now. </p><p>“It seems that I need to take a more active role,” I murmured. I didn’t know just how many deadly threats we were facing, but I wanted to keep things under control. With that decision made, I started drawing a long string of runes around the ward structure, turning it into a bomb, even as I watched as Iomene and the students stepped into the protective area of Cornelia’s ward. </p><p>Only for the monsters to smash against the wards with their full strength, threatening to overwhelm them immediately. </p><p>Luckily, the assault triggered several fire spells at once, taking down a nice chunk of the horde, gifting Cornelia with a considerable amount of experience —particularly valuable since as the level difference between us dwindled, I was about to lose my ability to boost her level directly. Still, rather than focusing on the convenience of helping her farm experience, I turned my attention toward the single-minded focus the monsters were displaying to chase Iomene, something outside of their usual crazed behavior. </p><p>Just like the previous horde I had watched. </p><p>Very suspicious, I thought even as I expanded my senses, and caught the subtle aura of another magic gem, this time an air-natured one.  It was on the bag of the surviving ranger, which I suspected that he was aware of. Now that I was examining him carefully, I could see that he was calmer than necessary, and moreover, I was able to recognize the signs of acting. He wasn’t as exhausted as he was showing. </p><p>It seemed that I misread the group composition. They weren’t just a bunch of random students, they were a bunch of random students with a spy mixed in. </p><p>That particular mystery didn’t take long to solve. “Anton, where is my fiancee,” asked the healer girl panickedly even as the ranger collapsed on the ground, making a show of his exhaustion. However, as he did so, he surreptitiously slipped a dagger into his hand, one with a subtle magical aura that I only noticed because I was focusing on it. And since it was subtle enough to challenge my detection capabilities, it was clearly a very dangerous weapon. </p><p>“I don’t know,” answered the ranger, who named Anton. “We split for scouting before the horde appeared…” he started explaining, his tone signaling that he was probably dead. Personally, I doubted it, not the ultimate fate, but the exact way he had died. If the bloody edge of his dagger was any indicator, our little spy seemingly used the opportunity to slip the dagger between his friend’s shoulder blades before baiting the horde. “But don’t worry, I’ll protect you,” he added even as he grabbed the hand of the girl, signaling a rather interesting motivation about killing the other ranger. </p><p>I shook my head in amusement, as I watched Anton’s responses, the illogical pattern of attack started to make more sense. It would have been much more logical to trigger the horde when they were closer to the camp, giving Anton the excuse to be the only survivor while threatening the city at the same time, but our spy turned out to be too ambitious. Not only he wanted to get rid of his rival, but also he wanted to do it in a way that would ensure his hold on the healer girl. </p><p>I would have called him an idiot, but frankly, I was the last person to blame anyone for trying to seduce someone during mortal danger. The only thing I could blame the idiot was the methods he had used, not to mention his misfortune of trying to employ the trick against someone I care about. </p><p>“Cease talking, and focus on recovering,” Iomene ordered even as she sent arrow after arrow outside the wards, while the monsters smashed against the wards repeatedly. “We’re going to move in a minute,” she added before turning to Cornelia. “Can the wards hold on?” </p><p>“It can hold for five minutes, unless a stronger monster attacks,” Cornelia answered, her face contorted as she supported the wards actively, her mana draining at a steady pace. “We’re still at the outskirts of the horde, and the attacks are easy to push back, but soon, we’ll get enveloped. I don’t think we’ll last long after that.” </p><p>“Good, can you keep it going for a minute after we left the camp before triggering an explosion.” </p><p>Cornelia took a second to answer, and only because I was using a simple arcana spell to whisper her directions. “Yes, that’s doable,” Cornelia said. “But it’ll take three minutes for me to set it up.” </p><p>Helga was startled at the response, as due to the nature of their ward, it was not a viable solution. Luckily, she was smart enough to keep her mouth shut. Unfortunately, her acting abilities weren’t good enough to hide it from Anton, who started to watch Helga suspiciously, especially after Helga and Cornelia shared an extended glance. </p><p>I needed to train them about how to hide their attitude at the first opportunity. </p><p>Anton stood up, his bow in hand as he walked toward the defensive perimeter, but my attention was on his left hand, holding the concealed dagger, much more professionally than I would have expected him to be capable of. Apparently, Helga wasn’t the only commoner hiding her skills. I had no doubt that as a commoner, he had struggled a lot among the noble students, insulted for his efforts as he did his best to rise to the top, but unfortunately, he decided to save himself by trying to sentence thousands of people to death, which lost any possible mercy he would have gained. </p><p>“Rest as much as you can, we’re going to move in two minutes, Iomene warned Anton. </p><p>“No, I have rested enough,” he said as he started shooting outside the wards, aiming for the flying creatures. Iomene’s attention was on the horde that was pushing against the wards, doing her best to take down the stronger creatures before they could breach the wards. His voice was sharp and heroic, posing perfectly for the healer girl. However, he also positioned himself perfectly between Helga and the rest of the group, ready to act at a moment’s notice. </p><p>I was impressed with his reaction. Too bad that I had no intention to let him live. The only reason he was still alive was that I was hoping to find a way to take him prisoner alive to interrogate, though, if he dared to act against Helga before the wards were breached, I could easily change my mind. He was stronger than his role as a student required, but he wasn’t strong enough for his survival to be a certainty under the circumstances. </p><p>It was an important detail, because that meant that he had been deemed an acceptable sacrifice in the ploy if things went wrong, meaning he wouldn’t have access to top-secret information. Meaning, between an injured Helga and a dead Anton, the choice was clear. I watched him carefully, ready to cast a shield the moment he acted. Luckily, before he could do so, Cornelia acted. </p><p>“I’m going to create a gate at the other side of the camp in fifteen seconds,” Cornelia shouted. “Let’s move.” </p><p>“Move,” Iomene ordered, but the students were already moving before she could give the order, the imminent threat conveyed by a crazed horde of a monster destroying the last scraps of discipline they possessed. That didn’t apply to my delicious companions, of course. Not only it wasn’t the first horde they were facing —another monster horde in Cornelia’s case, and an undead horde in Helga’s— but also they were aware that with me present, they weren’t actually in any danger. </p><p>Unlike the girls, Iomene wasn’t aware of the insurance. Still, she bravely stayed at the rear guard, her bow elegantly singing whenever a dangerous creature pushed against the protective walls of the ward threateningly to delay breaking. She still moved with the group, but from a distance, giving the students a chance to get away. </p><p>Hence, she missed when Anton stumbled, falling behind the group as well. I easily recognized the fake stumble, one that was done to create an excuse for the small dagger that left his hand, flying toward Helga. I reacted immediately, deflecting the dagger with a simple shield, but added an illusion to make it look like a successful hit. I even asked Helga to stumble as well. She didn’t do a good job of it, but the spy was too confident, turning his attention to Cornelia, another dagger in hand. I cast another spell. </p><p>[-416 Mana]</p><p>That was the moment when an air elemental appeared inside the wards, and before the group could even react, pounced at Anton. Cornelia cast a fire spell, but she recognized my favorite mount, so she intentionally used a flashy spell with no actual substance, which functioned more as a visual screen than an attack. When the flames were down, Anton was grabbed by the elemental, being dragged away. </p><p>“No!” cried the healer girl, but apparently, there was a reason for Anton to make a show of his achievements, because it was all she reacted. She didn’t even bother to stop, just continued to run, along with the rest of the group. </p><p>Iomene sent a couple of energy arrows at the air elemental, which damaged the construct more than I had expected, slowing its flight significantly. Apparently, I had significantly underestimated the power of her bow. Though, her continued attacks were not without cost, and seeing her spells were not effective, she turned her attention to the more immediate threat, letting one of her students go so that she could actually protect the others, making me admire her even more. I never faced such a decision myself, but without a doubt, it was a hard decision. </p><p>I made my construct to take a detour over the concealed spot, making it drop the backpack —more importantly, the air gem it contained— before it continued its escape, carrying the spy along. With the security of the girls ensured and the spy secured, all I needed to do was to keep the horde from following them, before detonating my trap once they were sufficiently away. </p><p>“Move, it’s about to explode,” Cornelia cried, quickening Iomene’s escape, who had been alarmed by the fake breach of the air elemental, expecting the wards to fall in a few seconds. I had expected her to notice the ploy, but that expectation only lasted until I looked at her carefully. She was on the edge of exhaustion, about to collapse, but still attacking the strongest monsters she could see. </p><p>“I’m going to go back to the school to discuss the latest developments. Go back to the city, and stay away from others,” I asked the girls through another spell, receiving simultaneous nods. Then, in a flight of fancy, I added one last sentence. “Also, make sure Iomene doesn’t die.” That made the girls look back simultaneously toward my location even as they continued to run, their expression having a matching suspicion. </p><p>Pity they were too far away to see my smirk, I thought even as I shifted my attention toward the horde that was pushing against the wards. I could have easily destroyed them with a spell, but that would have cost me the opportunity to take the other air gem. </p><p>And, more importantly, where was the fun in that…</p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 30    Experience: 447193 / 465000 </p><p>Strength: 41    Charisma: 53</p><p>Precision: 35    Perception: 37</p><p>Agility: 35     Manipulation: 40</p><p>Speed: 34       Intelligence: 44</p><p>Endurance: 34      Wisdom: 46</p><p>HP: 5370 / 5370 Mana: 5121 / 6600        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Master Subterfuge [97/100]         </p><p>Master Arcana [95/100]        </p><p>Expert Speech [70/75]</p><p>Advanced Craft [50/50]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 20/25]</p><p>[Helga - Level 17/21] </p>",

    "content": "<p>When I stepped out of the inn, there was a flurry of activity going on in the city, preparing for the night. The civilians were moving quickly toward the city center —the richer they are, closer to the center— while many armored people started to move their posts for the night. The night was dangerous, as not only it was much easier for the creatures to ambush people, but also their heightened activity level represented more danger. </p><p>Silver Spires didn’t have a similar burst of activity during the evening because of two reasons. First, the protective wards were much stronger, blunting the risk of a monster breakthrough significantly, and more importantly, the hordes of students were more than enough to handle any sudden breakthrough that might happen, and anything that couldn’t be handled by the ordinary guards or the students would be detected before they could even reach the walls. </p><p>The only thing that the school was really vulnerable to was assassinations, evidenced by the ease I displayed as I repeatedly sneaked in and out without even a guard being aware. Not surprisingly, the city walls were even easier to slip through even when they tripled the number of the guards holding vigil. </p><p>I left the city limits to follow the party of the girls, but only a sliver of my attention was on them. How could I maintain my focus, when the notification I had received about the system being depleted of its power threw most of my future plans into a chaotic storm. I didn’t know whether my trick to hasten the leveling of the girls would even work —or indeed responsible for the sudden depletion in the first place— or even my Companion Acquisition process would continue. </p><p>The only silver lining was the fact that there was no visible drop in my actual abilities, both in terms of Stats and Skills. </p><p>Still, even as I started thinking about the best sources to start my research for divine spark, I couldn’t help but snort in amusement. “Such arrogance,” I murmured. A month ago, just gaining a level was an incomprehensible achievement that seemed like a miracle, and now, I was unsatisfied by my Level thirty status, a cap that many would be willing to risk their life to have, not to mention the decades they needed to spend and the support they needed to actually reach that point. </p><p>And it wasn’t even my actual cap, but a temporary stop. </p><p>Greed was addictive, I realized with a self-depreciative snort. </p><p>However, as the cover of the night darkened, I abandoned my introspection about the perils of powers or the ways to reverse my status, and instead focused on my senses. Yes, I trusted the abilities of Helga and Cornelia to stay safe before I could catch up with them, but it was better to be safe than sorry as they walked toward an ambush. </p><p>As a fringe benefit, I finally had the chance to see Iomene in action. During their day travel, the students had handled the monster appearances while she stayed in the back. During the night, however, she took the lead, showing her worthiness as a ranger. She had an ornate longbow as her main weapon, using it with an ease that suggested either an impressively high level, or a hyper-focus on her weapon skill. For some reason, I was inclined to think the latter was the case. If she had other abilities to match her bow skills, she wouldn’t be marked as an easy target, no matter her lack of political support. </p><p>Of course, just because she was hyper-focused on her weapon skill didn’t mean she was useless. The ease she was showing as she picked the targets hundreds of yards away easily, followed by a pinpoint accuracy arrow, suggested both a keen eye and significant experience. The cold yet clear orders she conveyed, allowing the group to move efficiently without losing strength or time also suggested a long leadership expert, though that was less surprising. Her abilities might be barely enough to make her an ordinary faculty member in Silver Spires would have made her one of the leading figures in most cities. </p><p>As they continued to move deeper into the wilderness, I was slowly reducing the distance between us, partially because the darkness provided a convenient cover for my presence —and any nearby monster attacking them first before they even noticed me— and partially because I was getting a better understanding of Iomene’s observational capabilities and her perception Stat, allowing me to better measure the distance. </p><p>From a closer distance, I finally had a decent view of Iomene. The first thing that popped out about her was her hair, a shiny silver cover that shone brightly under the moonlight even when she tried to use her hood to cover it to avoid notice. The color was simply too noticeable to actually keep covered. She wasn’t tall enough to be actually classified as such, and had more of a lithe build both in terms of her chest and her hips. </p><p>Her face, however, strikingly beautiful despite the sharp angles, reminding me of the myths about fey folk, especially with her glimmering eyes that shared her hair color, especially under the moonlight. No wonder the rest of the faculty didn’t accept her despite her capabilities. However, despite her beauty, her clothing was extremely conservative, consisting of brown featureless leather armor and pants that hid her body perfectly. </p><p>The only exception to her drab dresses was her longbow, made from a tree I was unable to recognize, ornate enough to make me assume it was a decorative piece if I hadn’t watched her take down many low-class monsters with a single hit, delivering her arrows directly into the weakest spot. I suspected that it was a magical item, but it was hard to be sure from a distance in the absence of a direct effect. </p><p>As they got closer to the mission area —a small, concealed valley, perfect for an ambush— I started to feel a subtle sense of danger, and prepared myself to act. Then, Iomene gestured her group to stop, showing that I wasn’t the only one that was feeling tense. She stilled for a moment, looking at the distant valley, about half a mile away, for almost a minute. “Prepare a camp,” she ordered, pointing at a nearby rocky area. </p><p>“Do we need to, madam,” called one of the students in an exhausted tone, no doubt unhappy with the night mission, and wanting to finish it as quickly as possible. Arrogance was a dangerous habit. </p><p>“Prepare the camp, that’s an order,” she repeated calmly as she climbed over a nearby stone, not even bothering to look at the guy that commented, expecting her order to be followed. The guy bristled at being dismissed, his hand tightening around the hilt of his sword, but ultimately, that failed. The others students —except Cornelia and Helga— started cursing under their breaths even as they set up a perimeter quickly. </p><p>Iomene just ignored them. </p><p>“Should we set up magical defenses?” Cornelia asked, whose expression was much more serious. </p><p>That earned Iomene’s attention, her silver eyes momentarily shifting toward Cornelia. Cornelia took her gaze without flickering, her calm arrogance different than the confidence of an ordinary student. Ordinarily, I would have blamed it for Cornelia’s noble ego, but there was no frivolity in Cornelia’s tone. Unlike the rest of the team, she was fully aware of the danger they were facing, maybe even more acutely than Iomene herself, who only had a subtle sensation that alerted her about the danger. </p><p>Surprisingly, Iomene was quick to pick on that as well. “Set up the strongest defense you can set up without compromising your combat capability,” she ordered. “I have a bad feeling.” </p><p>“Paranoid bitch,” murmured the same male student that first challenged her decision, loud enough to be heard by everyone. </p><p>Iomene ignored the insult easily, but Cornelia was not as calm. “Would you mind repeating it?” Cornelia asked, her tone intimidating enough even without the ball of flame that started crackling in her hand threateningly. </p><p>The boy gasped in shock, stammering in shock, but before Cornelia could act, Iomene interjected. “Enough,” she called coldly, no doubt losing some of the respect she had generated toward Cornelia. I just shook my head. She still needed to learn to keep a better handle on her fury. “Just prepare the defenses as soon as possible. You have twenty minutes,” she said as she jumped down the rock, and gestured to the angry boy, as well as two of the rangers. “You two, follow me, we’re going to scout,” she added. </p><p>Despite their grumbling, the boys followed Iomene helplessly. They weren’t like Cornelia, with the strength to challenge the faculty members, so, rejecting a direct order was not an option, especially with a lack of sizable support. </p><p>They left, which left only four people in the camp. Helga and Cornelia, as well as a random healer girl and another male warrior. “You two, stay on guard,” Cornelia ordered sharply even as she moved toward the center of the camp, pulling a large emerald from her pocket, already carved with several runes to support many types of wards. Since Iomene was gone, it was trivial for me to sneak into the camp, so I got closer. </p><p>Helga walked toward her even as Cornelia was about to cast a spell. “We can’t use that for the center,” Helga said even as her fingers closed on the diamond. </p><p>“What do you know,” Cornelia snarled angrily, but considering anyone else daring to do the same would have threatened a fireball on the face, I could confidently say that their relationship was developing nicely, if a bit slow for my tastes. </p><p>Helga’s development, on the other hand, was much more noticeable. “Hey, if I need a brute to burn a forest down, I would trust you to handle it, but wards are my area of expertise,” she countered with smug expressions. “Or, can you actually set up a ward that is balanced between five nexus in less than ten minutes?” </p><p>Cornelia didn’t answer, but the tightening of her hand was sufficient as an answer. Her arcana proficiency was less than useful to achieve such a monumental task. “Doesn’t matter how fancy your initial structure, it’s meaningless if you can’t tie the appropriate destructive spells into the matrix, unless you count grazing a monster as a win,” she countered. </p><p>As much as I would have liked to watch their low-key argument, we were under a potential ambush, and I wanted to secure the camp as quickly as possible. “How about you girls work together?” I interjected, enjoying the way they flinched at my sudden appearance. </p><p>“Caesar,” they once again whispered simultaneously, angry at my sudden appearance. </p><p>“Hey, I told you that I’ll be following,” I said. </p><p>“Shouldn’t you follow instructor Iomene,” Helga asked. “She’s the one that’s facing a likely danger.” </p><p>“Maybe,” I said, as I wasn’t entirely sure of that, mostly because I was yet to discover how the ambush was going to be launched. “But I do know that I would risk her life than you two,” I added.</p><p>“You jerk,” Cornelia murmured, but she clearly appreciated the weird compliment. “So, what should we do?” she asked, her earlier dominance immediately disappearing with my appearance. </p><p>“You two are going to set up a defensive ward together,” I said, enjoying the simultaneous flash of distaste that appeared on their face. “That’s nonnegotiable,” I added, not giving them a chance to reject the suggestion. As much as I would have liked to watch them bicker, we were facing a dangerous situation, and I wanted to get a handle on it as quickly as possible. “Understood?” I added sharply when I noticed their petulant expression. </p><p>“Okay,” they murmured simultaneously, pouting cutely. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said, smiling even as I took a step forward, and kissed Helga’s lips, using that to transfer some mana, while I observed my soul space to check if there was any reaction. </p><p>[-156 Mana]</p><p>After a searing kiss, I pulled back while Helga blushed, confident that there was nothing wrong with the mana transfer. Interestingly, however, unlike many other times, I didn’t receive no experience notification due to the level difference, something that I had been solidly ignoring for a long while. </p><p>Then, I looked at Cornelia, who was looking haughty, doing her best to be prideful and not ask for a kiss, but failing spectacularly. “Come here,” I said with a chuckle. She snorted in anger, but that didn’t prevent her from smashing her lips against me, her tongue similarly enthusiastic. This time, I transferred mana not to help recover her mana, but to give her some more experience. </p><p>[-192 Mana]</p><p>Once again, I didn’t detect anything extraordinary, even when Cornelia received her experience boost normally. “Now, go and create the ward,” I said as I slapped her ass. “And don’t worry about spending all of your mana, as I can always help you recover,” I reminded the girls, happy with the lack of performance degradation in my support capabilities. </p><p>The girls left for the edges of the camp, immediately starting to argue about the warding scheme loudly, while I started creating a secondary hidden ward in the center of the camp, one that would keep me hidden from even the strongest observer as a side benefit. I wanted to stay in the warded area just in case. </p><p>I started constructing a complicated, layered ward that would stay hidden until I triggered, many weaves of mana wrapping around each other, something that was only possible through my ridiculous Manipulation stat, allowing unprecedented mana flexibility. I spent my mana excessively for the next hour, spending quite a bit of mana than what was necessary for a temporary camp, my attention on the state of my soul space. It was another experiment. I wanted to see whether excessive mana spending would affect my leveling status. </p><p>[-8315 Mana]</p><p>[+4 Arcana]</p><p>Luckily, during the construction phase, I hadn’t noticed any adverse effect, either on my magic potential or my regeneration speed, suggesting that the only change due to the depleted Divine Spark was the lack of further leveling —though, even that was an assumption that I needed to experiment further. The fact that my Arcana skill continued to develop was just another interesting bonus. </p><p>Only after constructing the ward, I turned my attention outside the wards, only to see Cornelia and Helga still arguing about certain details of the wards. “No, that wouldn’t work with the other spells,” Cornelia cut in. “We’re wasting mana.” </p><p>“I don’t think so, you’re forgetting the resonance effect,” Helga countered. They were too focused on the glowing structure in front of them to notice my closing presence. While they continued to argue, I looked over from their shoulder, seeing the impressive ward they had created, both more elegant and more dangerous than anything they could have created alone. </p><p>“Looks impressive,” I said even as I leaned down and captured Cornelia’s lips in a searing kiss, refreshing her mana through a searing kiss, before I pulled and repeated it for Helga.  </p><p>[-1846 Mana]</p><p>“So, it seems that we’re ready for any kind of activity,” I said even as I watched their blushing faces. “So, who is going to stay on guard and who is going to accompany me in the tent?” I asked. </p><p>“Maybe we’re going in and leave you on guard,” Helga tried to counter, trying to beat her shame in a different way. Cornelia smirked as well, like they had trapped me perfectly. </p><p>Unfortunately for her, I was more than happy to turn her bluff into reality. “Oh, really, go ahead if you can handle,” I said, smirking in such a patronizing manner that they had no choice but to follow their threat and walk into their tent. </p><p>I just smirked, curious which was stronger, the bad blood between them, or desire to resist my mocking. Unfortunately, the sound of an explosion reached my ear just as they were about to step into the tent. </p><p>“It seems that your little show is delayed, girls,” I sighed in disappointment even as I moved to a hidden observation spot, determined to stay until I could catch the reason for it. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 30    Experience: 447193 / 465000 </p><p>Strength: 41    Charisma: 53</p><p>Precision: 35    Perception: 37</p><p>Agility: 35     Manipulation: 40</p><p>Speed: 34       Intelligence: 44</p><p>Endurance: 34      Wisdom: 46</p><p>HP: 5370 / 5370 Mana: 5121 / 6600        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Master Subterfuge [97/100]         </p><p>Master Arcana [95/100]        </p><p>Expert Speech [70/75]</p><p>Advanced Craft [50/50]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 20/25]</p><p>[Helga - Level 17/21] </p>",

    "content": "<p>I watched as Carrie fell on her knees in front of me, which was an amazing sight, with her beautiful blonde hair spilling on her chest, crowning her cleavage which enhanced greatly thanks to the angle. However, something else grabbed my attention. </p><p>Her smile. </p><p>It was a smile that I had never seen on her face before, one that scared me with the promise it conveyed, wordlessly warning me that she was going to subject me to the same delicious torture I had forced her to endure moments earlier. And that was a scary thought, because of the aptitude she was showing. Despite her inexperience, she was proving to be an amazing student with her penchant for deep research —as she proved by providing the most excellent service while we shared a shower the day before— meaning I needed to be ready for some wonderful surprises. </p><p>“Focus on your homework,” she murmured even as she dragged her finger over my erection, my shorts proving to be poor insulation. Her smile widened, though her bravado was unable to hide her fragile personality, as she flickered with a question, testing whether she was going too far. </p><p>“As you wish, miss tutor,” I answered in exaggerated obedience as I grabbed the pen, giving her the space she desired to be playful. As I leaned forward, I lost sight of Carrie, blocked by the desk. It was a unique experience to see Carrie grow like that, and I didn’t want to squash it too quickly, even though she was quick to tempt me to abandon that particular track when I felt a flurry of motion under the desk, followed by a distinctive pile of fabric flying away, which I recognized at her top. </p><p>Despite the temptation, I managed to keep my attention on the practice questions, even when I felt her fingers on the elastic of my short. I raised my hips to allow her to successfully tug them, and she proved to be rather ambitious, dragging down my underwear alongside my shorts. I could feel her excitement even without seeing her, her trembling fingers clearly conveying her desires.</p><p>When she wrapped her soft fingers around my shaft, I didn’t bother to keep down my moan, more than happy to give her positive feedback, to make sure she knew she was in the right direction. Her fingers started to move, trying to look calm, but occasionally jerking hard, falling under the sway of her excitement. I tried to ignore the resulting jolts of pleasure and focused on the dance of my pencil over the practice questions, but it was hard. Numbers danced freely as her hand slowly picked up speed. Still, I was able to slowly work on the questions, achieving a fragile balance. </p><p>Then, I felt wetness around my girth, destroying the fragile balance I had managed to achieve. My pencil slipped from my fingers, rolling on the ground as I squeezed my lips shut, trying to process the sudden rush of pleasure as the vacuum of her pretty mouth wrapped around my shaft. </p><p>My pencil clacked on the floor, and a second later, her lips left my shaft. Before I could even ask for the reason, her pretty yet blushed face peeked under my desk, and presented me with the pencil. “You dropped this,” she said, a satisfied smile dominating her otherwise shy expression. </p><p>“Thanks, pretty,” I answered as I grabbed it, once again returning to my task, my fingers tight around my pencil. She returned to her task as well, her fingers wrapped around my thick pencil. Her lips returned to their task soon after, slowly bobbing like she was savoring the taste. This time, I didn’t need to deliberately try to moan, grunts started escaping my lips as she worked on my shaft, the impact of it significantly better than our shower adventure. </p><p>Without a doubt, she had been studying since yesterday. </p><p>Time passed slowly, as I suffered delicious torture while I started to solve questions under the slow torture of her lips. Luckily, while she studied the technique, she lacked the experience, meaning as time passed, it was getting harder for her to maintain the patience required for a proper edge-play, evidenced by her speed, which was slowly increasing. </p><p>Soon, I could feel her lips passing the halfway mark around my shaft even as it resulted in occasional subtle gasps. I was considering the relative merits of slipping my non-dominant hand under the desk to give her a helping push, but before I could come to a decision, her lips departed my shaft. I would have been concerned if it wasn’t for another flying piece of cloth, this time a lacy white bra which would have doubtlessly looked amazing on her perky tits. </p><p>However, I didn’t feel disappointed to miss seeing them, not when I felt a particular fleshy warmth envelop my shaft, far too big to be her hands. I looked down, only to see her blonde hair trying to peek from the edge, trying to squeeze. </p><p>I pushed back my chair to help her a bit. She slid forward, finally stepping out the overbearing cover of the desk, blessing me with the sight of her naked body, her tits wrapped around my shaft. She raised her head up, and I displayed her the exercise book on my left hand and my pencil on my right, showing that I was still following her request.   </p><p>“Good boy,” she murmured hesitantly, still uncomfortable with the power play, even a caricature one like the current one —not that I cared much. Then, she leaned down, her blonde hair spilling down to hide her face while she captured the head between her lips, her tits massaging the sides as she moved up and down. And they were perfect, to a point that I was having trouble to believe they were natural, but their flawless nature, bereft of even the smallest mark, proved otherwise. </p><p>She was a natural miracle. </p><p>Unsurprisingly, under her multi-pronged assault, I didn’t have the slightest chance to actually solve the questions. Instead, I scribbled a few nonsense answers, slightly more legible than ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs. When she started to go deeper to take half of my length in her mouth, the other half under the warm grasp of her tits, the level of pleasure climbed past distracting and reached mind-blanking levels. </p><p>I bit my lips to resist, but it was hopeless. She was simply too beautiful, and the juxtaposition between her apparent shyness and the skills she had developed through self-study made resisting her impossible. After filling the rest of the questions with nonsensical answers, I threw my exercise book, and hit on the desk with a rough clap, followed by the clatter of the pencil that followed it. </p><p>Hearing the sound, Carrie tried to raise her head, but my hands were already sliding through her blonde hair, preventing her movement. “I have finished my task already, sweetie,” I murmured. “Now it’s your turn.” </p><p>The moan she let out in response was spectacular, especially since my shaft was still in her mouth, making me enjoy the delicious trembles the moan created. I pressed slightly, expecting some resistance, only for her to slide down effortlessly, reminding me of the excellent performance that she displayed toward the end of the shower. And if her enthusiasm was any indicator, she had enjoyed that particular part quite a bit. </p><p>Curious about her limits, I continued to push her head down. Her breasts slid down, abandoning their post around the base of my shaft, but it wasn’t a great loss considering Carrie’s lips immediately annexed the abandoned territory. Even as she started to gag and I lessened the pressure, she grabbed my thighs instead to push herself deeper. So, I continued to push. </p><p>And, she continued to moan as she continued to swallow obediently, until the full range of my not-so-inconsiderable length was hidden in her pretty mouth, her throat massaging my shaft ceaselessly, each gag, each moan, turning into a delicious source of pleasure. Deep in her throat, she continued her massage, her slight discomfort unable to rival the pleasure she was deriving, as evidenced by her hand, disappearing under her skirt. </p><p>Her own addition tempted me to do more, and I let one of my hands slid down, as one hand was more than enough to assist her in her amazing service. My large hand landed on her breast, my fingers, strong enough to direct a ball as I threw it sixty feet away with pinpoint accuracy, delved into the perfection that was her breasts, mauling her flawless skin hard enough to leave delicious-looking pink marks. </p><p>She managed to squeeze a few moans between her loud gags as she continued to swallow my full length. </p><p>The initial plan was to pull away before cumming, teasing her with the probability of a delicious dessert if she could double-check my answers —while I continued to tease her, of course. However, they said no plan survived the contact with the enemy, and as long as formidable enemies were concerned, Carrie’s amazing tits belonged to the dangerous category that was banned with international agreements, the tight grip of her throat classified as a war crime. </p><p>I was just a poor mortal, how could I resist the plump lips of such a spectacular example of innocent beauty. Soon, the inevitable happened. I exploded, filling her throat with my seed, after a delayed warning. </p><p>She managed to pull herself back slightly, but still reached an incredible achievement and kept her lips locked around my girth, rather than receiving the load on her breasts like she did yesterday. </p><p>The result ended up as a mixture of both. Some, she managed to swallow between her coughs, but quite a bit of my seed slid down her lips, staining her beautiful tits with my mark once again. Admittedly, I was starting to think that I wouldn’t mind making her mine in a more permanent fashion. Her beauty and her intelligence presented a deadly combination, especially with the considerable assistance of her enthusiasm. </p><p>She proved that she was deserving of my considerable respect for her next question. “So, have you finished your homework?” she asked as she stood up —only by my help, as her legs were trembling horribly. </p><p>“Of course,” I answered immediately. “Do you want to check?” </p><p>“Of course,” she said, and tried to sit on my lap, but I pushed her toward the desk. She looked hurt for a moment, but that was replaced by an aroused surprise when I stood up as well, and slipped my hands under her skirt, tugging down her panties. </p><p>She looked like she was about to say something, her expression hesitant, but when I crouched behind her, she decided against it. Her concern was not hard to understand, that she wasn’t feeling ready about her virginity. Luckily for her, I already had something else in mind. </p><p>“Start checking the answers,” I ordered even as I put my hand on the small of her back, and forced her to bend over, her short skirt unable to handle that particular angle successfully. It climbed up, revealing her wet lips to my gaze thanks to the angle I had chosen. The slightest pressure was all I needed for her to part her legs at a sixty-degree angle, giving me perfect access. </p><p>Even as I asked her to do, I didn’t want her to catch my haphazard answers. Not because of an important reason, just because I wanted to see whether I could push her deep enough into the haze that she couldn’t reach the end of the worksheet before she climaxed once more. </p><p>It was a pity I couldn’t see her expression as my tongue brushed against her knob, because her moan was loud enough to make me glad I wasn’t living in an apartment, but a proper house, with no neighbor to alert. I hummed in appreciation, both about her explosive reaction, and the delicious sweetness that tingled on my tongue. Fortunately, my task was delicious enough to blunt the impact of not seeing her face. </p><p>As my tongue danced around her wetness, a number of sounds exploded in the rooms, which included grunts, moans, cries, and desperate gasps. However, the gentle touch of a pencil on paper was suspiciously absent. I smirked victoriously, as distracting Carrie from the allure of studying brought considerable satisfaction, though not as much as watching her plump ass jiggle after I slapped it softly. “How’s checking the answers going, sweetie,” I asked when I pulled back for a breather. </p><p>“G-good,” she stammered, barely able to utter a word before exploding into another string of moans as my tongue aggressively assaulted her knob. I pushed aggressively until she was starting to shiver with the anticipation of another climax, and then slowed down at that exact moment. Just another hard push would have toppled her, but I maintained my slow pace instead. “I had a bit of challenge with the third question,” I said, using my fingers to tease her while I asked the question before replacing them with my tongue once again. </p><p>“R-right now?” she stammered helplessly. </p><p>“Yes,” I simply said, slapping her ass to punctuate my statement. </p><p>“The formula is-” she tried to start, only for a moan to explode off her, drowning her words. She tried it again, but this time, she only managed to utter half a sentence before her pleasure overcame her stubbornness. She tried a few more times, but the best she was able to achieve was two sentences before her moans took back the control, until she forgot where she had been. Caressing her folds with such an indirect manner was certainly delicious. So delicious that, after a while, I lost control, triggering her climax earlier than I intended. </p><p>Not that it was a great sin. I stood up while she collapsed on the desk, her naked tits resting gently against the open books, while her eyes were closed as she processed the great source of pleasure. I watched her gentle trembling while I enjoyed the delicious aftertaste of her climax, still on my tongue… </p><p>It took a couple of minutes for her to gather herself, and she once again needed my help to stand up. She stood next to me, naked except for her skirt, which was messed enough to fail to cover anything important. “Thank you for your help,” I murmured, leaning forward to deliver a gentle kiss on her cheek. </p><p>“T-thanks,” she murmured. “But I need to go, it’s too late,” she said, fixing her skirt before crossing her arms around her chest. </p><p>If I was an inexperienced virgin, I would have assumed that her attitude was a repeat of the previous evening, where she was feeling the panic of her realization with the help of the clarity that only happened after a spectacular climax. But I wasn’t, which meant that in her tone, I could detect a desire for more, rather than the blind panic of the day before. “If you wish so,” I answered. “But it’s too late, and you’re tired. Why don’t you stay here?” </p><p>“I don’t know…” she murmured. “I’m not ready for … that,” she said, but her tone disagreed. </p><p>“Don’t worry,” I said even as I put my hand on her naked back, gently caressing along her spine to calm her down. “We don’t have to do anything you don’t want. We can just hug and sleep,” I offered, making the most deceptive offer possible. She just nodded in approval, a relaxed smile twisting her beautiful lips. </p><p>I just smirked even as I enjoyed her gentle embrace, rewarding me for my understanding, unaware of the hidden danger in the offer. Hugging and going to sleep was a difficult task, and despite the misconception around it, it was actually harder on girls —assuming they were with someone they find attractive, naturally. For men, arousal was something explosive, that happened instantly when facing something we desired. For women, it was a subtle accumulation, getting harder through the passage of time. </p><p>Sleeping together, after everything we had just done… Well, if Carrie could resist the temptation to push further, I would just obediently accept her decision. And if she couldn’t… </p><p>Well… </p>",

    "content": "<p>As I looked into Aria’s blue eyes, only to find dark, vindictive arousal rather than her usual passive goodness that reminded me of a saint. It put an equally dark smile on my face, as corrupting a hero was always good, and corrupting a heroine, especially in my preferred manner, was much better. I was satisfied by the impression I got, not just because it indicated the progress that overwhelmed my expectations, but also it provided me the perfect angle to finally conquer Emma. </p><p>I wasn’t one to miss such an opportunity. </p><p>“So, you want mercy?” I whispered to Emma’s ear, only to receive an enthusiastic nod, her lips firmly shut to keep her moans in to protect the last sliver of her pride, although unsuccessfully. “Do you think you deserve mercy, my sweet Aria?” </p><p>“She doesn’t,” came the answer immediately, followed by a slap to her inner thigh, soft enough to trigger another moan rather than a cry. I met with her gaze once more, and nodded in approval, only for her to blush thickly despite the aggressive pace she had embraced, showing that her aggressive front was nothing but an enthusiastic veneer. Still, that was more than enough for my purposes, as I didn’t want to lose my little innocent princess. </p><p>“Do you hear that, Emma? Your precious comrade doesn’t believe you deserve mercy, because you’re panting like a whore under the slightest pressure,” I whispered into her ear. “Is this the limits of the famous Elementalist that intimidated armies with her magical flares? Begging for mercy just because of a couple of measly touches?” </p><p>“Bastard,” Emma managed to murmur between moans, only to trigger Aria to quicken her assault. </p><p>“Not the worst I had been called, sweetie,” I said with a genuine chuckle. A thick skin was a requirement if one wanted to become a successful Dark Lord, especially half-assed insults like Emma had just thrown. However, just because her insult failed to awaken an emotional response in me didn’t mean that I was going to let her insult slide without making her pay. Luckily, I didn’t need to change my plan for it, just quicken it a bit, in the most fun way possible. </p><p>“What are you doing?” Emma gasped when she felt my grip tightening around her thighs, only to force her to stand up. </p><p>“Punishing you, of course,” I answered cheerfully, while even Aria slowed down to see what I was doing. They received their answer a few seconds later, when I aligned Emma’s entrance to my shaft, the crown pressing against her entrance. </p><p>“You can’t do that,” Emma gasped. “That’s too much.” </p><p>“I’m not going to do anything,” I said as I shifted my hands, holding her body from sides rather than pushing her up. “It’s your additional punishment. You just need to stay in that position while Aria finishes her task, and then we can discuss business.” </p><p>“What if I can’t stay in this pose?” she asked. As we argued, Aria pulled her hands back, waiting for a resolution.  </p><p>I chuckled. “You’re a smart girl, Emma,” I said, then chuckled. “At least, smart enough to understand the implications of failure. Isn’t it clear?” </p><p>“It is,” Emma stammered, her legs trembling in the realization of the potential. “It is too much,” she declared, though she didn’t try to pull out of my grip. </p><p>“Your call,” I answered her with a sudden change, pulling back my hands, which let her free. “You can just leave.” </p><p>“Really?” she asked, shocked at the sudden change, which was a reaction that Aria shared. “You’ll just let me go.” </p><p>“Of course, it’s not like I forced you to come here and undress. You’re free to leave whenever you wished,” I said, and her hips started to move. Then, I finished my words. “As long as you don’t want any more information about the spies, of course.”</p><p>Her movement stopped immediately. “That’s not fair,” she gasped. </p><p>“Really?” I said mockingly even as I slapped her ass, enjoying her yelp. “In that case, I should immediately offer you a better deal. Because, as a Dark Lord, I pride myself for offering people fair deals, especially the ones that actually ruined years of my efforts just to maintain the status quo.” </p><p>“No need to be snide, Byron, I’m sure she understands,” said Aria, surprising me with her interjection, especially when her smirk was pointing to Emma. An actual attempt at sarcasm. Even if it was the result of the excitement she was feeling at the moment, it was a great development. </p><p>“See, even your princess agrees,” I said, like Aria wasn’t the one that was delivering her punishment, during her current visit as well as the previous one. “So, what is it going to be? Do we stop, or do you dare to take the challenge?” The silence stretched for a moment while I was busy smirking. “You’re a strong girl, Emma. A simple challenge shouldn’t scare you this much. You just need to resist for fifteen minutes. Not a second more.” </p><p>Emma said nothing, but the direction of her hips was sufficient as an answer. Instead of moving away, they took the previous position, her sopping wet entrance touching to the crown of my shaft, ready to be plowed at the slightest mistake. Her silence just completed her challenge. </p><p>“Go ahead, my sweet princess,” I goaded Aria. “Teach her a lesson, and make her share your suffering.” Aria had the slightest flicker on her face as she realized the magnitude of my request, but her confusion only lasted until our eyes met once more. With her submissive personality, a calm look and a gentle smile were all I needed to dispel her doubts. </p><p>She leaned forward, capturing Emma’s nipple between her plump lips, taking another irrevocable step after the loss of her virginity, helping one of her teammates to lose hers. </p><p>Corruption was an interesting concept, every step of the descent suddenly making previously inconceivable actions palatable. Especially a submissive soul like Aria, who instinctively worked to make people around her happy, including me, the poor prisoner that was suffering under the yoke of the empire —if one looked from a lens warped by excessive compassion. Luckily, Aria had one of those lenses. </p><p>Emma moaned as Aria once again started working on her breasts, alternating between kisses and bites just like I had previously applied on her spectacular breasts. Her moans intensified further once Aria’s fingers started to dance over her clit, pushing her steadily toward the climax.</p><p>Unfortunately, even after ten minutes of steady assault of Aria, Emma managed to resist, which was admirable. It was easy to forget by looking at her pretty face that she had to have iron willpower to rise as the foremost Elementalist of the Empire, destroying her rivals through her sheer power on both sides of the alignment spectrum. </p><p>Too bad for her that my challenges were too unfamiliar to allow her to properly tap into her willpower. </p><p>Still, she managed to hold on, even as her wetness intensified under Aria’s insistent fingers, dripping along my shaft, like she was trying to lubricate it for the eventual inevitable ending. Still, as time moved, she held on. </p><p>I decided to join the fray. </p><p>“Impressive,” I said. “Just another couple of minutes, and you’ll win,” I said, informing Emma about the eventual victory. The human mind was a fascinating thing. A well-conditioned person could run for miles and miles, ignoring their exhaustion, but once they realize the closeness of the finish line, the exhaustion shows its maximum impact. </p><p>Just like that, just by being reminded that the finish line was close, I increased the pressure Emma was feeling several times. Her legs trembled in anticipation, but still stood without toppling. There, I decided to use my second trick. It was no different than the first one, a subtle, almost invisible pressure. This time, I waited until Aria was pulling back after a particularly furious assault to breathe, and Emma was busy bracing herself for the next assault. </p><p>I chose the moment between Emma’s two breaths to caress her spine, to a particularly sensitive spot I had discovered during our previous activities, my touch as gentle as a breeze. Already on the edge, that gentle push was all that was needed to trigger an unexpected climax, hitting her like an out-of-control inferno of flames. </p><p>“No,” she gasped in shock as her legs trembled, losing their strength. She still managed to react in time and grabbed Aria’s arm, managing to save herself. I met with Aria’s eyes, and shook my head subtly. </p><p>Aria pulled back her arm, leaving Emma without support. </p><p>With the pressure of her full weight, and her wetness, she easily slid down my shaft, surrendering her virginity in the process. </p><p>“You lose, Emma,” I whispered into her ear even as I grabbed her waist. </p><p>“No,” she repeated. “It can’t be. It’s just a dream.” </p><p>“Really,” I said even as I grabbed her hips and raised her slightly, making her enjoy the friction as her nether lips clamped around my girth tightly. “What kind of dream. A nightmare? Because I don’t think you should be moaning like that during a nightmare.” </p><p>Emma said nothing, because resisting the pleasure brought by the climax was hard enough without the additional waves of pleasure as her body reacted automatically, clinching around my girth, trying to milk me. Emma was another evidence of the dangers of stringing harem members too long left them far too thirsty for actual physical attention. </p><p>As my shaft explored Emma’s depths while accompanied by her melodic cries, her red hair jolting as she jumped up and down. Aria, on the other hand, took a step back, watching what was happening with a shocked expression, only now realizing the significance of her actions. But it was too late. </p><p>Still, it would be an asshole move to neglect her, so I gestured her to come closer. Despite her dazed expression, she did so, and when I started kissing her —without changing the pace of impaling Emma— her realization was awash by a fresh wave of pleasure. “You’re a good girl,” I whispered to her as I pulled back, which made her smile even as I slapped her ass. </p><p>“You’re not,” I continued, this time slapping Emma’s ass, who was split between the anguish of her loss and the new land of pleasure that was open in front of her. “Luckily for you, I have enough time to teach you how to be a good girl.” I slapped again, which triggered another cry of joy. “Understood?” </p><p>“Yes,” she moaned. I was tempted to push her more, to make her call me her lord, or another pretentious title, but Aria made that impossible. Not by any kind of actual resistance, trying to protect her comrade in arms. No, it seemed that she was feeling neglected, because I found myself being buried in her delicious bosom, which prevented me from speaking the best way possible. </p><p>Emma widened her legs as the pleasure invaded more and more parts of her mind, making it easier for her to jump up and down, especially after I grabbed her bottom, boosting her range of motion. Soon, she was able to take most of my length in every single repeat, turning her tits into a delicious pendulum as she jumped up and down —though, not as delicious as the ones I had my face buried in. </p><p>A loud moan escaped Aria’s mouth as I took her nipple between my lips, sucking furiously. Momentarily, distracted, I stopped boosting Emma’s aggressive jumps on my lap. Surprisingly, that didn’t affect her speed or range of motion even the slightest bit, only making her slow down a bit as she had to rely on her trembling legs. </p><p>What a wondrous reaction, my mind raced as I enjoyed Emma’s rhythmic treatment. I would have expected her to rebel even under the current circumstances, even that way was as ineffectual as sitting on my lap passively. Instead, she was jumping up and down aggressively. Clearly, I underestimated the allure of the pleasure, even though I shouldn’t have. After all, hadn’t I seen many people sacrificing both virtue and power to get a flicker of pleasure. </p><p>Why should Emma be any different? </p><p>I alternatively enjoyed Aria’s enthusiastic lips and her perky tits while Emma continued to jump up and down on my lap, almost automatically under the thrall of pleasure, her tunnel getting more used to my girth with every repeat. It was a unique experience to pump Emma’s tight hole from behind, especially as she moved like she had a grudge —whether that misplaced grudge was aimed at me, herself, or Aria, was a mystery. </p><p>It was pure, unadulterated fucking. </p><p>“Oh, no,” Emma moaned soon after, but her tone conveyed anything but distress. Instead, her tone was coated with pleasure, amplifying my enjoyment. “Fuck, you’re tight,” I said, or more accurately, mumbled, as my words were blocked by Aria’s tits once again. In response, Emma grunted absentmindedly, focusing on the enjoyment she was harvesting, both the spies and our bet forgotten. </p><p>I decided to remind her that, as much as I didn’t want to abandon the delicious hug of Aria’s breasts. I grabbed Emma’s hair, her beautiful red hair that fluttered animatedly whenever she cast a strong spell, making everyone recognize her from a distance. I pulled her precious hair hard, forcing her to look at my face. “So, Emma,” I said with a victorious tone. “Tell me, are you enjoying your loss?” </p><p>She didn’t expect to be confronted as she was building toward another climax, so she froze, and her hips came to a stop. Of course, that didn’t prevent her from steadily climbing the stairs of pleasure, because I took where she left off, and started pumping viciously, each hit forcing her hips to rise, only for me to pull her hair to keep her in place. She cried and moaned alternatively, enjoying my treatment. </p><p>However, when she grunted like she was trying to prevent an explosion, only to be accompanied by a sudden tightening of her tunnel, things changed. She climaxed again, this time even more explosively than the previous time which started her unique and enjoyable plight. </p><p>I would have liked to continue slamming into her unaffected, but even I had limits. A sexy redheaded mage tightening around my girth as she climaxed while a blonde princess leaning forward to steal another erotic kiss turned out to be one of those, and I exploded inside Emma, spraying her insides with my seed, conquering her in an even more visceral manner than just stealing her virginity. </p><p>She just moaned helplessly, while my own grunts of pleasure were devoured by Aria’s enthusiastic lips. </p><p>Who said being a prisoner was boring… </p>",

    "content": "<p>My discussion with Theodora came to a stop only when the slaver caravan stopped to camp for the night, and it left me with more questions than it answered, particularly on two areas. The first was the mysterious identity of Theodora. At first, I was sure that she was yet another border noble, but the amount of detail she explained about the working principles of the city was suspicious. Even more suspiciously, her details got more accurate the more important our topic of discussion had gotten, at least according to my limited knowledge, mostly pieced from the limited information of Lillian and nuggets from a library that was five centuries old. </p><p>In particular, she knew about the politics and habits of the Patrician families than anything else, which was mighty suspicious. She was clearly not the daughter of an unimportant noble. </p><p>However, I didn’t push her about her true identity, partially because I had more than enough to deal with the mysterious people following me, and I didn’t want to interject myself into another dangerous conspiracy. More importantly, she only told me that much because she felt that I was an unlucky tribal warrior that was enslaved because of her mistake, and she was struggling to pay back the only way she could. Since she thought I was a tribal warrior with almost no political awareness, she wasn’t careful in the anectodes and stories she told, accidentally revealing a lot more than she was supposed to. </p><p>But if I pushed her about her identity, she would stop. </p><p>So, I decided to leave that particular string of thoughts, to focus on my other problem. My upcoming sale as a gladiator. If it wasn’t for the details Theodora shared about the position of a gladiator, in particular their celebrity status, I would never have considered bothering to do so. Initially, I was planning to pose as a sellsword until I could get hired as a guard by one of the noble families, giving me easy access to their internal structure. </p><p>However, clearly, my condition was quite rare, according to almost-utter lack of information in the library gathered by the great Julius Caesar. Even though it was more focused on raising combat mages rather than exploring esoteric effects, I expected it to be more comprehensive than the library of a regular Equestrian or noble house. And while I had some clues about the temple of Jupiter and my condition being linked, infiltrating the seat of power that was the foremost symbol of authority and the right to rule wasn’t exactly the first choice. </p><p>Unfortunately, that left Patrician families as the only viable option. Each of them had libraries aged almost a dozen centuries —some even older— which gave me hope to find something useful. Unfortunately, infiltrating the estate of a patrician family would have taken months, maybe even years. Barging into their estates as a thief was also a poor option. Admittedly, it was quicker, but with even greater risks. Patrician families stood at the apex of Roman politics for centuries, and I doubted they could have if any thief or assassin could stroll in through their magical defenses. </p><p>Compared to those, being a gladiator was a much better option. All I needed to put a good show in the arena, and soon, I would get invited to parties as a guest of honor —more like a favored pet, but I didn’t exactly care about that particular distinction while I was slowly transforming into a monster— which would bring me inside Pomerium, which was the most difficult location to enter in Rome. From there, infiltrating their libraries would be much easier. </p><p>And the fact that I would be having sex with the daughters and wives of the strongest men in Rome was not exactly a chore —as long as I could keep those indiscretions hidden, of course. </p><p>The only potential problem was the great wards that were rumored to protect Pomerium and the immediate surrounding areas, suppressing people’s ability to use magic. It didn’t mean the complete suppression for Sorcerers, but apparently, it still downgraded the casting abilities significantly. </p><p>It shouldn’t affect me much considering I was going to be there to infiltrate rather than fight, it shouldn’t change my plans significantly. Still, it was a big decision, so I decided to leave it to the morning, deciding to sleep. </p><p>However before I could fall into the depths of the sleep, the distinctive click of a rusty rock clicked in the darkness, awakening me from my light sleep —it was another effect of my changing body, my sleep was light enough to be jolted awake at the slightest move, like a wild animal. </p><p>It was a cloudy night, so it was dark, and the flickering embers in the center of the camp did little to illuminate the prison carts. But my changing body allowed me to see even in the murky darkness of midnight. </p><p>I found myself looking at a familiar figure, wrapped in bandages. It was the ‘friend’ I had acquired earlier, the unlucky slaver that first attacked me. Though, surprisingly, he wasn’t in my cage, but the cage next to me, which was Theodora’s. “Bitch,” he murmured angrily as he slammed the door shut with a surprising loudness, his tone carrying hints of hysteric anger. Theodora awakened as the door slammed close, but surprisingly, the woman that was tasked to guard her continued to sleep. </p><p>“What’s going on?” Theodora managed to ask, her tone calm despite the fear I could read in her eyes, proving her strength. </p><p>“It’s payback time, bitch,” the wounded slaver said as he took a step forward. </p><p>“You can’t touch me, your boss will punish you,” Theodora iterated, somehow managing to keep her tone calm despite the danger she was facing, earning my admiration. I had no doubt that she was smart enough to realize the hopelessness of her situation. The fact that the slaver didn’t bother to lower his tone, combined with her sleeping guard, told a hopeless story, and Theodora was smart enough to catch that. </p><p>“Why would my boss punish me, when you will manage to escape with that bastard Thracian,” he answered as he walked closer with slow steps, enjoying the growing fear on Theodora’s face. She rattled her chains, trying to pull herself free. </p><p>Luckily for her, I liked her much better than a worthless slaver who made it his life’s aim to deprive others of their freedom, even before she spent hours explaining to me the political structure of the Capital. I had already unlocked my chains while I first noticed the identity of the intruder, and another simple spell was enough to unlock my cage door. A few quick steps later, I was standing behind the slaver. “I don’t appreciate people calling me a bastard, slaver,” I said even as I twisted his neck, killing him immediately. I didn’t even bother messing with him at first, because ultimately, he wasn’t worth it. </p><p>“You-” Theodora gasped. “You have the spark. How?” </p><p>I shrugged. “It’s not like Romans has the monopoly on the magic, you know. I have a couple of useful spells,” I said lazily even as I waved my hand, unlocking her chains. I still didn’t reveal anything about the true extent of my powers, or my origin. </p><p>I liked her, but that didn’t mean I trusted her. </p><p>“Incredible,” she gasped as she stood up, checking her arms and legs, fascinated. “I’m free, we can run away,” she said, tears of joy slipping down her cheek. </p><p>“Not we,” I said, and she stiffened. “Just you, I’m going to stay in here,” I quickly clarified in case she misunderstood. </p><p>“But why?” she asked, her eyes wide. “If it’s about the slave stamp, don’t worry. As long as we steal their stamp, it would make their jobs very hard to track us. The curse of the slave seal is very hard to track without a focus.” </p><p>“I know,” I said. “But I need to go to Rome, and it seems that being a gladiator is much better than the alternative.” </p><p>She looked at me incredulously, her brown eyes wide in shock. “Being a gladiator is like a death sentence, only longer,” she said. “Maybe one in a hundred gladiators manages to earn their freedom. It’s a death sentence.” </p><p>I shrugged, not seeing the point of explaining my power to her. “Don’t worry, I can handle it,” I said even as I stepped out of her cage, and she followed. A quick spell showed the location of my backpack and my spear, both thrown into a pile of spare items. I grabbed my bag and my spear, before I moved deeper into the slaver’s tents, leveraging the sleeping guards to steal the money stash of the slavers. </p><p>It wasn’t an impressive amount, barely enough to handle the daily needs of their caravan for a couple of months. No doubt that they were desperate to deliver high-quality slaves. They were in desperate need of cash. I passed the cash pouch to her. “That should be enough for you to return to Macedonia, and back with your family,” I offered, only for her to flinch back in shock. “No,” she gasped. “I can’t do that.” </p><p>“Why?” I asked, curious. </p><p>“I just can’t,” she murmured, insistent. As she panicked, however, her accent changed a bit, the influence of Greek getting even stronger. </p><p>“You’re not from the border provinces, right?” I asked, and she stiffened. “Maybe a bit farther away into the border, near the sea? Maybe near another capitol?” I asked. She stayed still for almost a minute, desperation filling her face. Only when I didn’t push her to an answer, she relaxed slightly, just enough to nod. </p><p>Things suddenly made more sense. She was not from the Republic, but from the Eastern Empire. Suddenly, her deep insights about the politics of Rome made quite a bit of sense, as the relationship between Constantinople and Rome was always tight, considering the two entities were both the greatest allies —and the worst enemies— of each other. </p><p>I didn’t know much about the politics of the Eastern Empire, but considering the temping prize of a throne was dangling in front of every strong family, it wasn’t hard to guess that it was even more cutthroat than the Republic politics. </p><p>No wonder Theodora was scared stiff just by the mention of an escape. </p><p>“Your call,” I said with a shrug. “Still, you can run away and hide in the countryside. A smart girl like you should be able to avoid attention, especially with a bit of cash to support yourself.” </p><p>I turned and walked toward the large cage that held the other slaves, however, I felt the footsteps of Theodora following me. How intriguing. I would have kicked her out if she was a man —or a woman lacking in beauty. As my relationship with Astrid and Lillian had shown, I did have a tendency to make bad decisions when pretty women were concerned. And Theodora was certainly a pretty one, with her lithe body with just the right amount of curves, her light olive skin, and her luscious brown hair that looked alluring even after weeks spent in a cage. </p><p>“Stay on the corner,” I said as I reached the slave cage, and cast an illusion spell to change my features, adapting the look of the slaver that tried to kill Theodora and me. I then cast a spell to jolt them awake. They had been rendered unconscious with the same herbal mixture that the slaver had used on the guards. It was strong enough to ignore the noise. </p><p>It wasn’t strong enough to ignore jolts of electricity. </p><p>I opened the cage door and quickly walked away after making sure that the slaves had noticed that it was the slaver that opened the cage. I was planning to return to my cage, when I felt Theodora’s arms wrapping around my waist. </p><p>I said nothing, just turned to look into her eyes, not bothering to verbalize my question. “I want to help you,” she offered. </p><p>“Help me on what?” I asked.</p><p>“Help you search whatever you’re looking for in the Patrician Estates,” she said.</p><p>“Impressive,” I said, not bothering to hide my position. After all, while I hid my roots successfully, the same couldn’t be said for my aim. After all, I had asked her too many questions about the lifestyle of the higher class. Earlier, she was convinced that I was asking those questions because I had no choice but to be a gladiator, but the ease I had displayed while escaping indicated otherwise. “And how are you going to help me with that?” I asked. </p><p>That stumped her a bit. </p><p>I sighed. Unless her presence was a miraculous trap arranged for me, her help was really welcome, especially since she was offering that without condition. I needed to know more about the upper society. </p><p>Of course, I wasn’t an idiot, so I knew that she was throwing herself into my problem, because whatever mysterious problem she had was likely as dangerous. Or at least, she thought so, as she couldn’t have expected my enemy was strong enough to illegally mobilize legions. “If you wish,” I said. Meanwhile, the slaves finally gathered the courage to step out of their cages, and started rushing away with a mad dash to the mountains. Since I had already destroyed the stamp, they had a genuine chance to reach their freedom, as long as they could pass the Alps by climbing to the mountain rather than using the passages. </p><p>That was all I could do for those unlucky fellows. </p><p>“Are you sure you want to help me?” I asked. </p><p>“Yes, I owe you for my freedom,” she said sharply. </p><p>“As you wish,” I said before changing direction. A quick pilfering of the slaver’s tents resulted in a few good quality clothes, designed for men. “Change into them,” I said and turned my back, but not bothering to leave the tent, instead of grabbing a few large silver coins, to craft a protective item for her just in case. However, just as I started that, I noticed a small mirror on the desk near me, reflecting as Theodora slowly started to undress. The gentlemanly thing would be stepping out to avoid looking at her naked body. </p><p>I wasn’t a gentleman. </p>",

    "content": "<p>It was almost six hours later that a knock was heard on the door, distracting us from the sweaty three-person knot we had become as we rested after another particularly exhausting bout. The break was a necessity after the marathon we had shared, which brought great dividends to both for me and for the girls, not just in terms of the amazing pleasure we had all drew from our rest, but also in terms of their development, much to their fascination. </p><p>[Helga - Level 17/21 - 12%] </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 19/25 - 96%]</p><p>After all, around their power level, improving by even a single level was an incredible achievement. </p><p>“Cornelia, the professor is saying we are going to meet in the lobby in ten minutes,” she had called. </p><p>“Got it,” Cornelia answered as she tried to raise her head from my chest, disturbing Helga’s rest in the process, earning a stink-eye in the process. </p><p>Their relationship evolved in a way I hadn’t completely foreseen during our boundless marathon. They mellowed against each other slightly, not to a point that they were any close to be called friend, but their stings got a bit blunter, and their attacks on each other received a more sexual undertone, releasing their repressed feelings in an unexpected way. Though, the competition aspect that they had, in the beginning, had never disappeared, turning it into a weird competition where they ambushed each other with various tricks, sometimes physical, sometimes magical. </p><p>A much better alternative to a boring variant of battle. </p><p>“We need to move,” Helga murmured dispirited, her exhaustion sapping her desire for the mission. I slapped her ass, which I used to cast a healing spell to remove exhaustion, jerking her awake better than any external stimulant. Then, I turned to Cornelia, who was looking equally exhausted, but this time, I chose a different way to awaken her. </p><p>I slipped inside her, her tunnel already slippery due to a mixture of her wetness and my many releases, to a point of feeling bloated. If it wasn’t for the generous amount of healing spells I had used, all of us would have been scrubbed raw, and even walking would have been exhausting. </p><p>“We need to get ready for the mission,” she gasped, but that didn’t prevent her from pushing her ass backward to achieve deeper penetration. </p><p>“I know, but wouldn’t you like to have another level before you moved,” I said, reminding her that she needed less than a thousand experience points to level up. </p><p>“I would like that,” Cornelia gasped, her arousal peeking up immediately at the reminder. After all, while a level up wouldn’t bring up immediate benefits since she was yet to complete the skill development from her earlier spells, but it didn’t matter when she was about to step into level twenty, which was widely accepted as the mark of a true elite. It was especially important for Cornelia, who had been being plagued by the fears of being unable to level up until very recently. </p><p>Not to mention, any boost to hit points or mana was welcome. </p><p>“Then, shut up and shake your ass,” I ordered, followed by a playful spank. Meanwhile, Helga giggled before stealing a kiss, elated with the payback she had been able to extract from Cornelia. Cornelia didn’t just surrender, and gave as good as it got, however, it was a very positive development from Helga’s perspective, as their earlier interactions had been just Cornelia lashing out while Helga suffered helplessly for scraps discarded for Cornelia.</p><p>“Would you mind helping me with the shower?” Helga asked. </p><p>“Sure,” I said and cast a simple water elemental spell, which pulled a thick line of water from the bathroom, cleaning Helga up in less than ten seconds, even leaving her dry. I would have liked to clean her slowly, using nothing but my hands —or maybe some other parts of my body as well if we had enough time to get dirty, and clean again— but unfortunately, the mission was about to start. Considering the potential underlying risks, including a potential spy in the midst of the group or disguised as another customer of the inn, it was for the best if they weren’t late to the meeting, avoiding attention. </p><p>While Helga watched, I was pumping inside Cornelia furiously, not bothering to hold myself back during a quickie, blasting Cornelia with my hot seed and my mana at the same time, finally allowing her to step into the vaunted level twenty. </p><p>[-1484 Mana]</p><p>[Achievement: Superior Support: Help two companions to level up three times each in one day, to protect yourself from the things to come. +2 to All Stats +3861 Experience]</p><p>“You can take a shower as well,” I said to Cornelia even as I slapped her ass, pushing her out of the bed even as I summoned another blob of water to help her shower quickly. “You girls can dress and leave, I’ll follow you from a distance,” I said. </p><p>While they burst into a flurry of activities, I turned my attention to the latest notification. Receiving another boost was always nice, but for two reasons, that achievement felt different. The first part was the amount of experience it had granted. It was the first achievement that had granted such a broken level of experience, instead of the nice, rounded numbers I had been receiving repeatedly. </p><p>That was suspicious enough, but even the text itself was different, flickering weakly like a torch that was about the be extinguished. I barely paid attention as the girls finished dressing. But just as they were about to leave, I remembered the bracelets I had created for them. “Wait a moment,” I called as I pulled the bracelets, and quickly slid them to their wrists, followed by two kisses while they blushed. </p><p>Their blush was understandable, despite everything we had done together, and the amazing bonuses they had received as a result, it was the first proper gift I was giving them. “Thanks,” they murmured simultaneously, with matching shy expressions. </p><p>“Nothing is too much for my girls,” I said, distracting myself from the irregularity of the latest achievement. “I have crafted them myself, and they are also woven with several protection charms that are effective against necromancers, both to keep you hidden and defend you against death bolts,” I added, their eyes widening as a result. Understandable, as it was a rather innovative product that reflected my amazing skills in smithing, Biomancy, and general magical aptitude. Since Oeyne couldn’t replicate it, I doubted there were many blacksmiths in the Empire that could actually do so. </p><p>The girls looked like they were ready to reward me properly for my gift, but unfortunately, they needed to go for their mission. After one last searing kiss, they left the room with a cute blush on their faces. </p><p>I stayed back, and turned my attention to the notification of the latest achievement, examining the shape of the text. Surprisingly, it flickered off, and then appeared again. </p><p>Another irregularity that had never happened before. </p><p>[Achievement: Superior Support: Help two companions to level up three times each in one day, to protect yourself from the things to come. +2 to All Stats +4193 Experience]</p><p>However, I didn’t receive a double bonus, my experience just increasing by about three hundred points. Then, I felt a sudden emptiness, similar, but not quite the same with the sensation of spending the full amount of my mana. Then, another writing appeared on my sight. </p><p>[Warning! Divine Spark is depleted. Connect with more Divine Sparks to continue supporting the System of ———]</p><p>“Fuck,” I murmured as I turned my full attention inward, examining my soul space desperately. The notification was scary, especially since it wasn’t exactly clear on what the System lacking in energy meant. For a moment, I was scared that I would start losing my power. I used my Tantric skill to carefully examine my own soul space, to see whether my power was fading, but failed to find any evidence for that. </p><p>Unfortunately, it wasn’t sufficient evidence. I could only hope that my abilities wouldn’t suddenly start to fail. Still, I sighed, losing some of the tension. Lack of an immediate depletion was definitely better than nothing. Maybe nothing would happen to my acquired abilities, and even if something had happened, at least I would have time to resolve the issue. If the worst happened, I could always go and have a talk with the headmistress, who might have a better idea about what was happening, owing to her great age and mysterious connections. </p><p>I doubted that I could handle losing everything I had gained, not after already experiencing the clarity of the power. Compared to that, temporarily —or even permanently— joining her camp was a much better option. </p><p>Luckily, it didn’t seem like a necessary thing to happen, because my perks continued to maintain their activity without any apparent loss of power. I raised my hand and cast a simple water spell, before flaring it in a complicated pattern that stretched my control abilities to the limit, clearing that at least my elemental abilities were intact. Then, I repeated the same with a fire spell, checking the performance of the temporary skill granted through my connection with Cornelia, and it also worked like it was supposed to.  </p><p>Then, I moved onto my other skill, rapidly testing them, from other magical skills to melee, even testing crafting just in case. Luckily, they seemed to work without a problem as well. Now, the only problem was whether it was a comprehensive issue that prevented me from gaining strength from all sources, or whether I could continue to gain experience directly and through ordinary achievements. </p><p>Still, there was a silver lining in my challenge. Since other people in the inn wasn’t going crazy with the sudden loss of their power, it was clearly something unique to me, but the broken text of the notification was clear that my System was depleted of its unique energy source, strongly suggesting that my System was actually independent of the one that other people accessed. Its mysterious blocked name only confirmed it further. </p><p>In a way, it wasn’t surprising. The other people received experience through killing monsters, and absorbing a sliver of their potential in the process. However, I didn’t have any such source, and while sex-related activities triggered the development, I didn’t actually drain any power from the girls I was together with, or, at least, I didn’t do that in a noticeable way. </p><p>On the contrary, I could easily strengthen them with my mana. Or at least, I hoped so, because if using mana to enhance them was tapping into the same source with the experience, it would be a nasty surprise. The timing of the power depletion was suspicious, and whether it was the case needed to be confirmed through the experimentation. Hopefully, it wouldn’t be the case, not just because it would turn out to be a dangerous unforced mistake I had committed, but also it would significantly affect my future plans, forcing me to keep my supporting cast of ladies much smaller. </p><p>I certainly hoped that wasn’t the case. </p><p>“Such a nasty timing,” I murmured as I thought about the incoming undead attack. I had been planning to gain a couple of more spells by visiting Titania once more before the ultimate siege, but it doesn’t seem to be possible anymore. I sighed, and left the room through the window after a quick shower. </p><p>“At least I already have a clue on how to fix it,” I murmured, glad to have that notification. I didn’t know what a Divine Spark was, let alone where I could find them, or actually use them to enhance my power. Still, it was a clue in the right direction, and gave me an angle to research. </p><p>More importantly, it proved that there was a potential solution in the first place. I just needed to add another thing to my growing list of mysteries. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 30    Experience: 447193 / 465000 </p><p>Strength: 41    Charisma: 53</p><p>Precision: 35    Perception: 37</p><p>Agility: 35     Manipulation: 40</p><p>Speed: 34       Intelligence: 44</p><p>Endurance: 34      Wisdom: 46</p><p>HP: 5370 / 5370 Mana: 5121 / 6600        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Master Subterfuge [97/100]         </p><p>Master Arcana [91/100]        </p><p>Expert Speech [70/75]</p><p>Advanced Craft [50/50]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 20/25]</p><p>[Helga - Level 17/21] </p>",

    "content": "<p>Cornelia watched smugly as I laid Helga on her bed, to allow her to catch her breath after the spectacular orgasm she had just experienced, her mind further strained by leveling up. As Helga leaned against her pillow, Cornelia coughed, which sounded suspiciously like the word weak. But I was convinced that it was just my misconception. </p><p>Definitely. </p><p>Still, when I turned to Cornelia, I was just smirking in amusement rather than feeling the anger that I would doubtlessly feel. But despite her habitual bitchiness, she somehow gained a place in my growing area of influence. Admittedly, her current mode of dress —a sexy corset, and nothing else, not even panties— made it much easier to convert what might have been annoying disobedience into sexy playfulness. </p><p>Taming Cornelia was still not a completed task. </p><p>“So,” she murmured as she took a step forward, not bothering to hide her arousal. “Your warm-up is over. Are you ready for the real fun?” </p><p>“Oh, really,” I said even as I watched her close the distance, still amused by the great change Cornelia was displaying. It wasn’t long ago that the only thing she felt against me was burning anger, and barely a couple of weeks ago, she didn’t even see me worthy enough to lick her shoes. A month ago, before I get a glimpse of her beautiful body on that fateful night at the library, I actually wasn’t worthy to lick those shoes. </p><p>Life was interesting. </p><p>My introspection didn’t last long, abandoned when I felt a pair of lips pressing against mine, initiating a searing kiss. Cornelia was showing a surprising level of initiative, as while she had clearly enjoyed the previous times we shared together, she wasn’t always as enthusiastic in the beginning. Though, it wasn’t particularly difficult to realize it was still about proving herself better than Helga, as any good woman from a proper lineage should be compared to one from a merchant family. </p><p>I grabbed her ass when she jumped, her legs wrapping around my waist. “You’re already hard,” she whispered into my ear as she stopped kissing for a moment. </p><p>“My physical prowess shouldn’t be surprising at this point,” I whispered back, making her shiver in anticipation. After all, just because she was trying to prove herself to be better than Helga didn’t mean that she wasn’t enjoying the treatment she started to receive. I slid my hand down her corset, using magic to untie the strings until it fell on the ground as well, finally revealing her deliciously lithe body. She might not have Helga’s curves, but no one could argue that she was any less sexy because of it. </p><p>She grabbed my hand and gently led me toward the empty bed in the room, her hips swaying excessively with each step. I sat on the bed, my legs parted, and she crouched in front of me, without the slightest prompting. “Delicious,” she murmured as she grabbed the crown between her lips, her hands gently dancing on my thighs. As a reward for her initiative, I sent a flood of mana through our erotic connection, rewarding her with another level. </p><p> [-916 Mana]</p><p>[Cornelia - Level 18/25 - 2%] </p><p>She moaned in appreciation even as her movements froze, processing her level, while I made eye contact with Helga, who was slowly awakening from her explosive orgasm. The anal assault had been decisive enough without the addition of Cornelia’s fingers, which were rather skilled around the private parts of other women —an expected development considering the general direction of her taste. </p><p>I shared a conspiratorial smile with Helga while Cornelia impaled herself deeper onto my shaft, her lips swallowing enough of my shaft to trigger a little jump of anticipation. Still, Helga continued to lay as she tried to catch her breath, so I turned my focus back to Cornelia, letting my fingers slip through her flaming red hair. She moaned in genuine joy as she continued to swallow more of my length, showing that she had learned quite a bit from our earlier encounters. </p><p>She might have a poor personality, but still, she was really fitting to be my personal maid. And if I could simultaneously make the head of her noble family, even better. </p><p>A groan escaped my mouth as her tongue wrapped around my girth, and I pushed my hips forward in desire, finally penetrating into the tight grip of her throat. Despite my girth stretching her lips, I could see the twitch of a satisfied smile on her lips. It stayed there even as I started to thrust harder and harder, her tits jiggling under the constant rhythm. </p><p> Cornelia’s moans of joy started to echo louder, once again making me glad for the silencing ward, signaling that her lust had grown to an uncontrollable degree. Her hips started to move mindlessly even as she sucked, seeking stimulation, more than her silken lips could gain from my rock-hard shaft. Luckily, I saw Helga standing up in her bed, suggesting that Cornelia’s desires were not too far away. </p><p>At my level, multitasking was not a problem, which was why it was extremely easy to conjure a craft a strap-on for Helga from a distance, using more magic than material, while also allowing Cornelia to gain more experience. </p><p>[-1619 Mana]</p><p>[Cornelia - Level 18/25 - 11%] </p><p>The redheaded beauty moaned in appreciation as she climbed toward another climax, her body giving in completely for the pleasure, alternating between providing an excellent suction and taking my girth to her throat, wondrous enough to make me moan. Even better, she didn’t show the slightest hesitation as I finally put my hand through her red hair, stealing the control from her in favor of furiously fucking her face.  </p><p>She just accepted my furious assault, enjoying the impact. </p><p>But as I saw Helga walking toward us, the crafted strap-on firmly affixed to her waist, and nothing else. Her curvy body looked delicious as always, her tits jiggling with each step as if they were begging me to abandon Cornelia and bury into their comfortable depth. However, the most important thing was her expression. colored with the excitement of revenge, enough to convince me to move onto the next step of our fun activities. I pulled out, which earned a disappointed hiss. “I wasn’t finished,” she slurred, her tongue addled with pleasure. </p><p>“No worries, sweetie, I have better things in mind,” I answered even as I grabbed her waist and raised her to her feet, only to bend her down from her waist and force her to turn toward Helga. </p><p>“W-what-” Cornelia tried to comment, only for me to slide into her wetness, losing the rest of her sentence in a moan of pleasure. More importantly, Helga used the opportunity to slide her strap-on into her mouth, neatly preventing any other argument. </p><p>She tried to moan in protest, of course, but I just chuckled as I caressed her back. “Come on, honey, Helga is just being a sweetheart and helping you climax, just like you have helped her to reach there many times. Don’t be an ingrate. It doesn’t fit your noble bearing.” </p><p>She didn’t say anything, mostly because she couldn’t say anything. Unless she started using spells, of course, but she was smart enough to realize I wouldn’t appreciate such an activity. Instead, she twisted and moaned, trying to protest —which, surprisingly, did little to actually push Helga away, or stop the furious dance of her hips as she was invaded by Helga’s toy —the only saving grace was I didn’t craft it to be particularly large, a bit thinner and shorter than my own, which meant proven ability to handle it without complications. </p><p>I tried to make eye contact with Helga, but her eyes were locked on Cornelia’s struggling face, her face contorted with dark satisfaction. An understandable reaction. She was not an aggressive person, but she wasn’t naturally meek like Marianne as well, and the only reason she acted passively against all the abuse she had received was the —justified— fear of being targeted by the more established nobles. </p><p>And while it could be argued that Cornelia offered her a fair deal before dragged her into the role of a sadistic release, logic was rarely a tool that could be used to handle resentment. Helga needed a release, and despite the underlying shift in roles and the implied insults, Cornelia was clearly enjoying being double-teamed, so all was well. </p><p>Realizing I wasn’t facing a fragile situation that forced me to maintain a constant observation, I shifted my focus back on Cornelia’s delicious body, impaling her aggressively, every push accompanied by another moan. </p><p>[-916 Mana]</p><p>[Cornelia - Level 18/25 - 17%]</p><p>I decided to up the ante just as Cornelia started to tighten around my girth, trying to extract my seed, but failing to do so. I kept pumping without skipping a beat, but a simple cleaning spell ensured that her backdoor entrance was properly cleaned. I slipped a finger, earning a grunt, which would have been a bunch of words if it wasn’t for Helga’s toy, still invading her throat mercilessly.</p><p>I pushed forward, enjoying the way her tightness closed around my finger, getting even snugger as I added a second finger in short order. As usual, Cornelia’s tightness was spectacular, resisting my attempts to loosen her up successfully with an impressive resistance. Too bad that ultimately, it was doomed for failure, as the longer it continued, the more passionate Cornelia’s moans become, her red hair desperately sticking to her sweaty body. </p><p>Her moans of pleasure contrasted greatly with the gasp of disappointment when I pulled out of her, which was immediately followed by a louder moan of joy when I impaled her tight hole, especially as at the same time, I conjured a buzzing toy to plug her wet tunnel. With all three of her holes plugged in, Cornelia’s moans turned into a string of mindless gasps, her hips moving back and forth under the combined assault of me and Helga, picking up more and more speed. </p><p>Then, I watched as Helga pulled back and removed her strap-on, surprised by the sudden change. I hadn’t been expecting her to show mercy at this point. Then, she pushed her crotch against Cornelia’s lips as she grabbed her hair in a painful manner, replacing earlier shock with understanding. “Lick it, you smug bitch,” Helga exclaimed in a surprising manner, ignoring Cornelia’s shocked cry as her treatment got even rougher. </p><p>Still, much to my surprise, Cornelia actually followed Helga’s rude request, her tongue jumping out to caress Helga’s wetness. I couldn’t help but speed up even further, the collusion of flesh filling the room. Cornelia managed to achieve the impossible, and continued to get tighter and tighter as she moved toward another climax, while Helga’s unobstructed moans filled the room. </p><p>“Oh, yeah, just like that, bitch,” Helga continued, cursing in a very uncharacteristic manner as she tapped deeper into the frustration she accumulated as she tried to survive in Silver Spires, no doubt enhanced by the fact that her life was being targeted in a plot, and not even because anything she had done, but because she was a convenient target that wouldn’t be missed. Her free hand trawled down and arrived at Cornelia’s tits, slapping them mercilessly while tugging her hair even harder. </p><p>“Damn, girl,” I murmured in amusement, though my voice was also strained by a climax that was about to arrive. I transferred even more mana to Cornelia as she was proving to be an excellent sport, which deserved a special award. </p><p>[-2188 Mana]</p><p>[Cornelia - Level 18/25 - 32%]</p><p>Her reaction to the flood of experience was another joyful moan that didn’t particularly stand up amongst the chain she was continuously letting out, enjoying the fragile balance that was established. Her expression was not visible, unfortunately, but Helga’s was, her usually stoic face contorted with pleasure as her long-time opponent’s tongue let loose over her most sensitive spot, displaying her breadth of experience. </p><p>Since Cornelia was enjoying spankings too much, I decided to join in. My hand landed on her perky ass, the clap echoing hard enough to suppress their moans. Cornelia clenched harder, while Helga’s attention finally turned back to me —which didn’t stop her hair pulling or tit slapping activities— her eyes shining with mirth. She was clearly enjoying her reward immensely. </p><p>“Lick faster,” Helga ordered as she maintained eye contact with me, her expression quirked deliciously. However, Cornelia failed to follow that particular order. Not because she suddenly decided to rebel, however. No, instead, she finally toppled over the cliff, the impact of her climax hitting her like a tackle of a rabid dragon, draining every single scrap of energy from her body as the pleasure replaced every single thought she possessed. </p><p>“Such a weakling,” Helga commented as she pulled back, merciless enough to make Cornelia hit the floor painfully if it wasn’t for my reflexes, immediately grabbing her from the waist, even as I started spraying insides. I would have liked to say that I disapproved of Helga’s sudden meanness, but that would have been a lie. It was extremely arousing to discover another facet of my blonde beauty, despite the extreme conditions it required to extract. </p><p>I was barely able to put Cornelia on her bed when Helga pushed me on the same bed and sat on my lap, managing to impale herself to my half-erect shaft —which didn’t take long to return back to full life thanks to my endurance. Just a searing kiss from Helga had been enough to complete the task. “Don’t be rude,” I said to her after the kiss, though failed to hide the mirth from my tone. It was more or less a fair payback considering their relationship up to this point. </p><p>“Hey, we’re still going to have a talk about hiding important information,” Helga countered, though she failed to add an angry tone to her words as her wet tunnel was finally impaled with something other than Cornelia’s adventurous fingers, her wetness spectacular. </p><p>“Really, what’s going to be my punishment, then?” I asked even as I grabbed her hips and pushed my shaft inside her to the hilt, forcing a delicious cry off her lips which killed her argument before she could even verbalize it. A few strokes into her core, and her entrance was wide open, sucking me deep into her presence. </p><p>“I - I don’t know,” she managed to stammer after a minute of uninterrupted moans, finding it hard to speak as my fingers dug into her generous chest, while her hips rose instinctively to meet my strokes. “J-just make me cum,” she ultimately requested. </p><p>“As you wish, milady,” I said with a wide smirk as I grabbed her waist and threw her on Cornelia’s body, creating a delicious mixture of red and blonde before I slipped inside her once more. We still had a few hours until the arranged mission time, and I wanted to help them level up as much as possible. </p><p>After all, assisting others to level up was the selfless thing to do. And I certainly felt like a saint as I penetrated Helga on top of the exhausted figure of Cornelia… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 30    Experience: 443000 / 465000 </p><p>Strength: 39    Charisma: 51</p><p>Precision: 33    Perception: 35</p><p>Agility: 33     Manipulation: 38</p><p>Speed: 32       Intelligence: 42</p><p>Endurance: 32      Wisdom: 44</p><p>HP: 5070 / 5070\tMana: 2168 / 6300        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Master Subterfuge [97/100]         </p><p>Master Arcana [91/100]        </p><p>Expert Speech [70/75]</p><p>Advanced Craft [50/50]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 18/25]</p><p>[Helga - Level 14/19] </p>",

    "content": "<p>Unlike the previous times, I didn’t bother to leave a gap in the curtains. After everything that happened, her visit was inevitable. </p><p>The lights went off almost immediately. Then, she pulled my curtains open barely ten minutes after I faked going to sleep, immediately following my first fake snore, not even bothering to check whether I was fully asleep. Her usual caution was abandoned to the winds, which wasn’t surprising considering she had turned into a bundle of nerves thanks to the combination of her revealing clothing and my extended teasing. </p><p>However, keeping my reaction hidden as I watched the curtain being pulled from my cracked eyelid took everything I possessed.  as she pulled the curtain open to step into the area I deemed as my bedroom. I was expecting her to be either naked, or still wearing the same clothing she had been wearing ten minutes ago. </p><p>Instead, she met in the middle of those two options, dressed only in her lingerie. The same red, transparent lingerie she had been wearing during the day, which enhanced her deliciousness several times. The transparent fabric of the bra was barely able to contain her huge breasts, just adding a nice red hue to her fair skin. And that was before her nipples rebelled, doing their best to cut through the fragile fabric. And in the darkness of the room, her rosy areolas looked as beautiful as a poem. </p><p>Her panties were even better. The same fabric that struggled to contain her breasts fared no better in containing her plump ass, stretched to the limit the best way possible. And factoring in the fact that after a day of extended denial, her panties were absolutely drenched, making the transparent fabric almost non-existent in certain places, revealing her smooth core my pleasure. </p><p>Once again, I watched her beautiful body in fascination, unable to believe that somehow these high school boys failed to discover the treasure that lay beneath just because of their chase of more popular. </p><p>Well, their loss, my gain… </p><p> Despite her courage in the way she dressed, she was still careful as she pulled off my blanket, revealing my erection, which was still hard. It would have been suspicious, if it wasn’t for the fact that her whole frame of reference consisted of other times she sneaked into my bed, therefore assuming that a full mast while sleeping was completely ordinary. </p><p>I waited silently as my naughty goddess climbed on my bed once again, as silent as she could manage, uncaring just how much her movements stretched the capabilities of her underwear. Still, she surprised me immensely when she pressed her weight against the side of my shaft, giving it a nice caress with her wetness as she slowly moved up and down, her flimsy panties only thing preventing an accidental slip. I was never as glad to convince someone I was an unbelievably heavy sleeper. </p><p>As she moved up and down, her eyes were firmly shut under the rush of pleasure, allowing me to open my eyes to watch the full glory of her act. It was risky, that if she opened her eyes, I could have been caught easily, but watching her barely contained breasts jiggle was worth it, especially when the moonlight added a beautiful sheen to her skin, making the moment ethereal and erotic at the same time. </p><p>She was rather careless as she leaned forward, putting her hands on my chest, along with enough weight to wake up any sleeping person. But, lost in her desires, she didn’t care about the significance of it. She leaned harder and harder against my chest for a while, not caring that maybe she might wake me up. </p><p>I was struck with a desire to grab her wrists and pull her on the bed next to me, educating her about the risks of awakening the sleeping lion. It wasn’t the first time I was struck with that thought, but unlike the other times, I seriously started to consider it when she pulled one of her hands away, and it landed on her breast. She started caressing herself as her hips moved thirstily. </p><p>However, I was glad that I managed to hold back, because it seemed that it was just the start of the show. She bent down until her tits rubbed against my chest, the silky texture of her bra no better to separate our skin than her panties, existing there just to enhance the sensation. She started to move upwards, pressing her tits against my chest at first, but then, she started to climb upward. I kept my eyes firmly shut at that point due to our closeness, but I didn’t need my sight to know what she was doing when I could feel her globes caressing my neck at first, then my face got buried in the amazing pillow created by her cleavage. </p><p>For a fleeting moment, I was absolutely sure that I had died, and went to heaven. The touch of her breasts was just that soft. I let my lips move, faking the mindless movement of a sleeping person, giving myself an excuse to leave a lingering kiss on the edge of her areola, half an inch away from her nipple. </p><p>When she pulled back, I didn’t felt a sense of disappointment, mostly because her hips started to gyrate with a renewed fervor, tempting me to reach my wallet, pull a bunch of bills, and start squeezing her body while using tipping as a transparent excuse. </p><p>She proved that I wasn’t the only one feeling captured in the naughty scenario, because she reached to her back and unlatched her bra without stopping her breasts. It slid a bit, but her arms were ready to catch it, somehow enhancing the scene further by hiding the sight of her rock-hard nipples for a moment. Her hips continued to move more rapidly, torturing my shaft while she let her bra slid lower inch by inch, before ultimately letting it go. </p><p>It fell on my chest carelessly, but once again, Anna looked uncaring about the risk of waking me up, convinced that I slept like a rock. For a smart girl, she knew how to trick herself if it was for her benefit. </p><p>Her topless, grinding dance continued. Objectively, it wasn’t the smoothest lap dance I had ever received, but her amateurish abilities didn’t detract from the moment. On the contrary, knowing that every passionate swing of her hips was fueled by real emotion made it ten times better than any private show I could acquire, no matter how beautiful was the stripper, or how fancy was the club. </p><p>Now naked, her firm breasts started to sway freely with every repeat, creating a sense of motion I wanted to capture with my thick fingers, getting lost in the depths of her flesh. Her wetness that drenched her panties and my shaft alike didn’t help me to quench that desire either. She continued to rock her hips for the next several minutes, her eyes firmly closed to enjoy the sensation, allowing me to observe her show with open eyes. </p><p>I bit my lips in an effort to keep in a grunt. I was so tempted to cut through the veneer of acting to confront her, to push her to the ultimate end. I never felt such a sharp desire for someone to envelop my presence so acutely, the need burning my heart like a forest fire, wrapped around like scorched chains. Somehow, however, I managed to tap into the same well of willpower that kept me on track on my career rather than turning into yet another drug-addled bodyguard or a lazy waiter that hoped for the ultimate break to save his dreams to become an artist. </p><p>However, it was hard, especially when I felt her legs tightening around my torso, her body hit with a shattering orgasm that made her gush like a broken tap, drenching my crotch completely. Her hands landed on my chest carelessly once more as she tried to balance herself, her weight acutely present on me. All it would take was a sleepless move, and it would be skewered inside her, making her mine…</p><p>Luckily —and unluckily at the same time— she stood up before I could act. A part of me —a small, clinical part that drove me to make new year commitments— was glad, but that part was drowned by the intense desire I felt. Luckily, she was walking away. </p><p>Or so I thought when she turned her back… Only to be surprised when her fingers were hooked around her wet panties, pulling them down with a deliberate slowness that could have driven me crazy even without revealing the unobstructed sight of her smooth lips and her boundless yet firm ass. I expected her to drop them on the ground then go to the shower, only to be surprised at both counts. She grabbed them firmly in her hand, and she once again turned to face me. </p><p>Surprised, I was late to react, closing my eyes only after she completed her turn. Luckily, the moonlight wasn’t the brightest source of light, and more importantly, her attention was on my glistening shaft —her parted lips giving me an idea about what she had in mind— to notice my eyes. However, even then, she managed to compound my surprise by climbing on the bed again rather than reaching from the side, showing absolute confidence that I would continue sleeping. </p><p>Though, admittedly, since I ‘slept’ through her latest treatment, it wasn’t absurd for her to think so. </p><p>Even better, rather than facing the same way I did, she chose a different way, instead of positioning her hips over my chest while her lips pointed at my shaft, in the delicious position of sixty-nine. Everything was ready to push for the next step, the temptation burning brightly. She proved that she was doing her research by wrapping the base of my shaft with her still-wet panties, while she slowly lowered her lips, her breath caressing my throbbing shaft.  </p><p>Thanks to the limited line of sight the position granted to her, my eyes were once again wide open, enjoying the amazing sight of her parted legs, which spreading her nether lips slightly without the pressure from her thick thighs. Her arousal smelt sweet, reminding me of fresh strawberries, tempting me for a taste. When her tits pressed against my stomach and her lips enveloped the crown of my shaft, however, I was unable to resist the temptation for more than a second. </p><p>Her hips were low enough so that all would it took for me to caress her sweet entrance was to raise my head slightly, and let my tongue darted out. The only knowledge that kept me chained was knowing if my tongue touched at her entrance, she would have jolted away like a scared lamb, sentencing my poor throbbing shaft into a horrible fate. </p><p>Unknowingly, she provided me with a consolation prize. As one of her hands stayed around the base of my shaft, moving up and down in a desire to make me explode, the other landed in between her trembling nether lips, slowly caressing as she tried to push for the second climax of the day. My shaft moved deeper and deeper into my mouth, to a point that her lips were repeatedly hitting the thumb of the hand she used to pump my shaft. </p><p>Once again, she proved the determination that allowed her to attain the perfect grade record, and pulled away from the obstructing hand —only to land on her breast, squeezing her nipple— and swallowed even more of my shaft. She wasn’t smooth, but her desire and determination were once again more than enough to smooth her technical failings. The vacuum of her mouth enveloped most of my length, her tongue assisting occasionally. Considering the impressiveness of my length and girth, it was a true achievement. </p><p>It was like being trapped in a silk furnace, hot and soft at the same time, generating unlimited pleasure as she bobbed her head, her moans buzzing gently. When the head of my shaft finally hit the entrance of her throat, she pulled back, discouraged by her loud gag, but before I could even feel disappointment, she repeated the attempt again… Then again…</p><p>Soon, she was close to deep-throating my shaft successfully. If only my hands were near her beautiful blonde hair, ready to give a little assistance for her to achieve her aim… </p><p>When she finally pulled back and stood on her knees, I felt disappointed, thinking that she was sufficiently satisfied with her oral fixation. A second later, I realized that I was right, but not in the way I had been fearing. She moved forward along my belly, her core dripping a complete track, until finally, she had my shaft under her once more. Unlike the previous time, however, she aligned herself perfectly, that if she moved slightly down, she would have skewered herself. </p><p>“So big,” she murmured as the crown pressed against her entrance, preparing to abandon her virginity. “It’s all your fault,” she added softly even as she continued to align my erection for the ultimate move. “If you didn’t treat me like I’m a beautiful girl, I wouldn’t be burning with a desire that was impossible to quench with just my fingers. Now, you need to pay.” </p><p>It was time to act, I decided. Our little game was fun, but we needed to have a talk before she took a step that she couldn’t erase.</p><p>“Thank you,” I said with a smirk even as I grabbed her waist, and pulled her to my side. She found herself lying next to me, while I enjoyed the way her eyes opened in shock, inevitably making eye contact. </p><p>“I can explain,” she muttered automatically, frozen as she lay next to me. </p><p>“Sure, go ahead,” I said, though made sure to smile to prevent her from collapsing in panic. As I expected, she failed to say anything at first, her smart brain trying to catch up with the sudden emergency. I made a show of sighing. “It seems that we need to talk.” </p><p>She just nodded, her beauty as tempting as an innocent angel that found herself in the lair of the devil, begging to be tempted… </p>",

    "content": "<p>I had many achievements as the most dangerous Dark Lord in the last few centuries, but watching the naked figure of Aria munching on Emma’s breasts in the most secure prison cell of the Empire definitely ranked near the top. The only thing that could have made it better was to have Queen Sapphire here as well, wrapped in the same chains that they hoped to use to imprison me. </p><p>Like I was just a patsy that would spill all the information after their amateurish attempts to torture. </p><p>Silence ruled the room as Emma’s shocked gaze danced between Aria and me, no doubt shocked by the daring the princess was showing. Even if she was under orders, the fact that Aria was managing to touch someone else sexually without fainting was a small miracle. “How?” she finally managed to gasp after another minute of silence. </p><p>“Well, first of all, I’m an amazing teacher,” I said with a chuckle. “Though, I do have a good student here,” I added, patting Aria’s ass gently to leave no doubt about the target of my words, before returning to caress her lower lips. Aria shivered while Emma looked at me incredulously. </p><p>“You’re unbelievable,” she gasped in shock. </p><p>“I know,” I said as I shrugged. Her statement was accurate. There’s no more than a handful of people in the whole world after I had been captured, and the rest of them were consummate professionals with mechanical precision, and wouldn’t be daring enough to take the risks I did. </p><p>Still, there was the question of what to do next. While I was tempted to sit back as Aria worked on Emma, it went without a hitch mostly because Emma was still shocked by the scene she had stumbled upon. She must have thought that I wouldn’t have dared to take the final step and deflower the only princess of the Empire, though why did she think that, I had no idea. I was daring enough to take the throne of the Dark Lord, staking my claim on the obedient Aria was nothing in comparison. </p><p>Maybe she had bought my explanation about creating an alliance with them because I was afraid of the other dark houses seriously. Though, I was only surprised by the intensity of her belief, not that she had fallen to my flimsy explanation in the first place. When making a big mistake —like the one Emma believed herself made by freeing me— or facing a big loss, the decision-making process of most people somehow starts to fail, and like a gambling addict, they start to follow absurd totems to recover their loss. </p><p>My explanation to Emma was no different. I told Emma that, by cooperating with me, she not only had the chance of removing herself from a mistake that would see her imprisoned as a traitor, but she could also actually recover herself from the situation politically stronger than ever. The fact that she still believed that she had the chance to steal the location of the Eternal Core from my mind was her insurance. </p><p>Pity that, like a gambler, she was playing a rigged game from the start. </p><p>“So, let’s talk business,” I said while I took a step to the side, closing in the distance between us once more, even though I had to abandon the delicious sight of Aria’s ass. Still, all was not bad, because it gave me the opportunity to grab her tits to enjoy it significantly. </p><p>“Right now?” Emma said, hopeful as she turned to Aria. “Stop,” she said, expecting Aria to follow her order immediately like she always did due to her weak nature. Unfortunately for Emma, while Aria was still lacked the spine to push back, my orders were much more important than hers. I just needed to put my hand on her back gently for her to get the message, and continue biting and kissing Emma’s lips. “Stop!” she repeated, again in vain. </p><p>“Your punishment is not over,” I explained. “Still, I feel that the position we’re sharing is not conducive to business dealing, with one of us sitting while the other standing up. Both of us should be sitting down.” </p><p>“But there’s only one chair,” she said immediately, a little mistake in perception that could be blamed on her distraction. </p><p>My smirk widened. “I know.” </p><p>Hearing my salacious tone, it didn’t take long for her to realize my meaning. “That’s too-” she started, but under my gaze, she folded quickly and stood up. Her rapid obedience was not surprising, as after our last encounter saw her being spanked mercilessly and fingered at the same time while being stuffed with her own panties. Compared to that, sitting on my lap certainly wasn’t worse. She looked at my naked shaft indecisively for a while, but ultimately, she decided to sit down, trusting the isolation ability of her dress, which was still bunched around her waist. </p><p>It was another mistake, of course, but she wouldn’t realize that immediately. </p><p>“Nice,” I said as I felt her slim ass press against my naked shaft, the velvety texture of her dress adding an interesting layer of sensation in between. I let my hands rest on her waist even as I caught Aria’s eyes, burning with a sudden burst of jealousy. The reason and the target were not in doubt, as almost in the same second, Emma cried in pain. “Careful,” she gasped. </p><p>“It’s a punishment,” Aria said, letting her nipple go for a moment to reveal the red marks her teeth had left, surprising both of us. It seemed that our innocent princess was triggered by jealousy. It was good to know. </p><p>Emma said nothing, shocked by the sudden change of attitude in Aria, not that the said attitude was particularly biting. It was like a friendly kitten suddenly scratching, it wasn’t particularly vicious, but still intimidating due to its source. </p><p>To leverage the situation, I let my hands sneak under Emma’s skirt, resting gently on her thighs. “So, what exactly do you need from this humble prisoner?” I said, not bothering to hide the mocking edge in my tone. </p><p>From her bluster, it was clear that Emma didn’t appreciate my mocking comments, but her lack of power —not to mention her growing arousal, as evidenced by the wetness on my little finger when I let it move too close to her panties— kept that particular complaint wordless. “I need to discover another spy, this time higher in the hierarchy,” she said. “There’s a dangerous plot I had learned from this one,” she explained, though not explicitly mentioning her attempt to make a mental intrusion, “but he didn’t know anything apart from the needing some magical crystals and a lot of weapons. I need to discover more.” </p><p>I didn’t tell her that if she had been more careful, she would have easily discovered more about the plot from his compatriots, as her lack of ability only strengthened my bargaining hand. Still, preventing a dark plot worked to my benefit, as it would give other wannabe dark nobles something to do. “Not a problem,” I said. “Of course, it’s about the payment as well,” I said, letting my hands climb upward, caressing her soft spot through her panties. </p><p>Emma shivered erotically, which was followed by another gasp of pain as Aria once again bit hard enough to leave a mark. “W-what do you want?” she murmured resignedly, no doubt already having an idea about my request, inspired by the view she had stumbled when she first came in. Moreover, even though she kept her tone neutral, she couldn’t hide her wetness. She clearly wanted more after the spectacular fingering she had received the last time, and Aria’s continuous kissing and biting wasn’t exactly something to calm her down. </p><p>Since she was already giving signals of accepting my rather aggressive touch, I decided to tease her a bit more. “I want some decent furniture, and maybe some clothing,” I said. </p><p>“I acc-” she started immediately without properly listening, only to stammer halfway. “What?” </p><p>“I want a room that’s not just a wall and nothing else,” I explained. “I want a proper bed to sleep in, maybe a couch to laze around, and a couple of books,” I explained. “I might be freer, but I’m still locked in this room. And believe me, you don’t want me getting bored in here.” </p><p>“I-I see,” she stammered once more, trying to reorient herself from her near-surrender. “I don’t have the right to make those changes, though,” she said. </p><p>“Then go convince the Queen for it,” I offered, startling both girls, enough that Aria had pulled back from her task. I continued, disregarding their panic. “It should be easy, just tell her that you managed to extract another spy from me, and that should ensure Queen approving a few small comforts for me.” My smirk widened as I let my hands slip under her panties, teasing her wetness directly, extracting a moan. “And, if you can present it correctly, the Queen might even let you handle the rest of the interrogation. Wouldn’t that be fun?” </p><p>“No,” she immediately answered, but the actual meaning of her word was barely legible as her voice drowned in another moan. </p><p>“Really,” I drawled as I circled around her clit, slowly driving her toward a climax. “Because you don’t react like you’re disliking the treatment, even when I’m not forcing you to stay here,” I said. </p><p>She tried to stand up at that word, and for a moment, she even succeeded on that, only for me to use the opportunity to give a hard tug to her dress, pulling it to the ground, leaving her wearing only a pair of flimsy panties which turned even more transparent with her wetness. She was ripe for taking. However, since I wasn’t a brute, I didn’t plunge in directly. Instead, I used her shock at my daring move to pull her back on my lap, this time, my shaft trapped between her thighs. </p><p>“That’s too much,” she gasped as she felt my hardness against her entrance, protected only by her flimsy panties. Her back was still pressing against my chest, which made her face Aria. </p><p>“Really?” I asked even as I slipped my fingers in the confines of her panties, this time after caressing her stomach for a while. “You think that’s too much, after poor Aria is doing her best to fix your unnecessary mistakes,” I added. I pulled my hand out of her panties after a short yet aggressive caressing that brought her dangerously close to a climax, only to pull back. I grabbed her waist instead, only to lift her. </p><p>Rather than skewering her directly, I let her sit further on my lap, meaning my shaft was pressing against her shapely ass. “That’s her fault of being a cowardly slut,” Emma tried to counter, once again more than willing to throw Aria under fire without a need, proving the rather poor quality of their relationship. In her defense, looking at the used state of her tits, covered with Aria’s teeth marks, this time it was at least partially justified. </p><p>However, it also stroked Aria’s anger even more, which was the exact opportunity I was waiting to push her deeper into the pit of depravity. “You seem to be looking for more punishment,” I said even as I ripped her panties off, and parted her legs with my steely grab. I looked at Aria, and continued. “Finger her, just like I had taught you, but make sure she doesn’t cum,” I said. </p><p>“That’s too much-” Emma tried to argue, but in the position we were in, it was trivial to stuff her mouth with her own panties once more. I was ready to grab her wrists to pull her arms back, but being gagged with her own panties seemed to be sufficient as a warning. </p><p>“Go on,” I said to Aria even as I reestablished my grip on Emma’s toned legs, enjoying the sensation as my fingers sank into her flesh. </p><p>Aria had an ecstatic expression on her face as her fingers danced around Emma’s most sensitive spot, realizing that for once in her life, she wasn’t expected to accept the pointless insults of the others just to defend the reputation of her position. </p><p>For once, she could strike back. </p><p>Emma’s eyes widened in shock as Aria’s fingers started to tease her in a way she hadn’t expecting. It wasn’t the first time she felt foreign fingers around her entrance, of course, as I was the owner of that honor, acquired during our previous encounters, but Aria’s soft, gentle fingers doubtlessly felt different. </p><p>When she opened her mouth to ask Aria to stop, I reacted faster. “Let’s see for how long you’ll be able to handle Aria’s treatment,” I whispered to her. </p><p>Despite all her bluster, Emma was not a complicated woman, and her competitiveness was one of her easier triggers, especially against someone like Aria whom she had complicated feelings about. She took my challenge and stayed silent, daring Aria silently. </p><p>Aria flinched under Emma’s gaze, violently enough that if it wasn’t for my presence giving her confidence, she would have already retreated. Instead, our eyes met, and my smile calmed her down. </p><p>Emma was determined at first, but as time progressed, that determination started to get chipped under the weight of the moment. She found herself in a daze, at a loss about how to react, not expecting Aria to continue such a lewd task without pausing. </p><p>She was going to pay for underestimating my ‘student’. </p><p>I didn’t bother doing anything other than keeping her legs parted for Aria’s convenience, while Emma started shuffling in her place —which rather amazing effect on my shaft— showing signs of distress. The growing pleasure without a release started to take its toll, amplified by her situation.  </p><p>Barely five minutes later, Emma cracked. “Please,” she whispered, her voice raspy. </p><p>“So soon,” Aria said, showing a surprising initiative as her face was split with a victorious smirk. </p><p>“I have to agree,” I said even as I let my fingers caress her inner thigh, making her shiver helplessly. “Was that it? I expect you to withstand much more than that.” </p><p>Emma didn’t look happy with the disregard she was receiving from both sides, but apparently, the feeling of her body was more important. “Please,” she repeated. </p><p>I make eye contact with Aria even as I tried to decide how to progress.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Locked in the cage, there wasn’t anything I could do as the slavers gathered the camp before whipping the horses, and we started moving once more. Or more accurately, there were quite a few things I could have done, but those actions were more trouble than their worth, so I just lie on my back, enjoying the ride. Since I could easily escape whenever I want, there was no problem treating the cart as easy access to Rome, conveniently avoiding all patrols and other requirements. </p><p>Even better, the trip itself wasn’t boring. I did have a delicious eye candy for me in my fellow slave. Theodora might be dressed in rags and dirtied in her most recent attempt to escape, but even the grime was unable to hide her beauty. She had luscious dark brown hair, somehow managing to shine under a thin layer of dust and dirt, and her skin was flawless other than a few small scrapes she acquired recently. She had a lovely face, and even while she wasn’t trying to look attractive, her lips were curled in an attractive pout, begging to be tasted. </p><p>However, the most interesting thing was her eyes. Not their beauty —though they were plenty beautiful, reminding me of almonds both in shape and in color— but the way they shone with a sharp intelligence as she looked around, desperately looking for a chance to escape. I was impressed. For a girl with a noble upbringing, she was more unyielding than I expected. Even Lillian hadn’t been like that, and unlike Theodora, she had magic. Since Theodora hadn’t used any magic, it seemed that she was one of the unlucky ones without the spark of magic —or had come from one of the smaller cultures that didn’t allow women to learn magic. Unfortunately, I couldn’t recognize the accents of the eastern border enough to make an educated guess about her location. </p><p>As the slaver caravan lined up for the passage, waiting for their turn, I was starting to get bored. Luckily, I had a conversation partner nearby. The only inconvenience was her guard, standing next to her, who no doubt would interject if I tried to talk with her. </p><p>Luckily, I had the ability to bypass such small inconveniences. I pulled a sliver of my magic, letting it settle around both cages, isolating both mine and Theodora’s voice, before letting a thicker string of mana wrap around her guard, letting her fall asleep. Interestingly, when the sliver of magic connected to her guard, Theodora flinched in surprise before looking around in confusion. </p><p>Interesting, I thought. Her ability to feel the spell told me that my second assumption was likely correct. She did have the potential for magic —a strong one if she could feel such a subtle piece of magic— but she clearly didn’t receive the proper training, which immediately made her an even more interesting conversation partner. </p><p>I looked at Theodora, and she flinched when our eyes were connected. The guilt that shone in her eyes left no doubt about the source of her distress. “It seems that being a slave is a boring affair,” I said to her with a smile, mocking the situation as lightly as I could manage. </p><p>“How can you not hate me?” Theodora countered immediately, her tone soft, displaying her kind heart. “It’s my fault that you lost your freedom.” </p><p>I sighed. “We already talked about that, it’s just a coincidence. There was no way you could expect that, and even if you did, I’m not sure I could blame you. You’re just trying to escape from the same fate, after all. It’s justified.” </p><p>“Yes,” she murmured. “But it seems that it would not do. Escaping at the mountains was my last hope. If I reached the mountains, I could have avoided their search parties. After the passage, we have the plains of Italy. With the density of the population there, it’s impossible to hide from them.” </p><p>“That seems to be the case,” I said, though, as I listened, I was starting to feel suspicious for some reason. She was far too calm and collected to be a sheltered noble daughter, analyzing the situation coldly despite the distress she felt, which made my earlier assumption about her being a sheltered noble daughter into question. </p><p>The mystery behind yet another noble was not a particularly compelling one. It might have a number of reasons, she might belong to a particularly large branch of the family, she might be a bastard, or she might be deliberately kept from learning magic to make sure the house inheritance passed without an issue, especially if her brothers were less talented than her. Normally, it was expected for the eldest son to inherit, and technically, daughters couldn’t inherit unless all sons were unable to inherit, but like everything, things blurred when the said daughter was several times stronger than the sons… </p><p>However, the mystery behind her status might be boring, but locked in a cage, waiting for the line to move at a glacial pace, I didn’t have anything else to do. I decided to test her a bit. “So, what exactly awaits us in Rome?” I said, continuing to use the fake accent I had perfected while preparing for this travel. “They mentioned that someone named Ludus Dacicus is going to purchase me, apparently.” </p><p>“Ludus Dacicus not a person, but a gladiator school. The slavers probably didn't even know the name of their contact, and using the name of the school to refer him,” she explained. “They are not exactly the smartest,” she said with clear disdain. Her attitude was rather dismissive, but considering they were about to sell her to the highest bidder like a cattle, I couldn’t begrudge her for that little insult. </p><p>“They are not,” I agreed with her. “So, what exactly is that school?” I added, as my knowledge about the Colosseum of Rome was limited to snippets I had heard back in the school, where the noble students were discussing the tales about the great victories, however, considering the distance between Britannium and Rome, the trickling of news was hardly accurate in the first place, and the scraps I had heard was mostly useless. </p><p>Especially since I never bothered to learn them, not expecting to find myself in Rome in any part of my life. </p><p>“Ludus Dacicus, or the Dacian School is one of the gladiator schools based in Rome, and they are famous for their Gladiators from Thrace, especially Dacia, and they focus on using spears,” she explained immediately, perking up slightly. It was obvious that she was treating this as an opportunity to pay back. I knew that part despite my limited information about Rome, but I let her explain further, mostly to make her relax. ”More accurately, historically, it’s one of the four great gladiator schools, though, for the last century or so, they are in a great decline. The other three are Ludus Gallicus, the Gallic School, Ludus Matutinus, the Bestiaries School, and the greatest of the four, and the first real gladiator school, Ludus Magnus, the first true gladiator school, and the undisputed leader of the games.” </p><p>“How interesting,” I murmured. “Do you know why the Dacian School is in decline?” I asked, interested to finally learn some new information. </p><p>“It’s mostly because of the rivalry with the Gallic School. Ludus Magnus had always been the undisputed strongest of the four, and the Ludus Matutinus has their own special niche, training both the arena beasts, both magical and mundane, and training their gladiators to take down the wild animals,” she explained. “That made Gallic and Dacian Schools fight for the role of the second-best, turning their fights into a historical constant. However, the Dacian School had really suffered when one of the previous owners had tried to run as a Consul in the elections, and used the gladiators to intimidate some of his opponents. At first, things went well, considering the lack of military presence in Rome, but soon, his opponent allied with the Gallic school, and great bloodshed occurred.” </p><p>“The people in charge shouldn’t be too enthusiastic about that,” I said, smirking. </p><p>“They were not,” she said, stopping just a second to smile before she continued without prompting. “However, things took a dark turn for the Dacians when one of the senators had died after being stabbed with the sword of a Dacian Gladiator, and to make things worse, he died in the bounds of Pomerium, turning it into a truly unholy act.” </p><p>I didn’t ask what a Pomerium was, because even a tribal warrior was expected to know that, due to the incredible consequences of daring to violate the official borders. Pomerium was the official border of a Roman city, and technically, Rome only truly existed in these borders. Anything else was simply the territory owned by the cities. And like anything Roman, it was shrouded by a thick layer of history, religion, and tradition. The most important part, however, neither weapons, nor the military presence, was allowed to step into the borders of Pomerium, on the pain of death. It was even greater for the city of Rome, as even the Generals were not allowed to step into the Pomerium without resigning. </p><p>Yeah, killing anyone in the borders of Pomerium, especially with a sword, was not good. </p><p>“I’m assuming things weren’t simply forgiven,” I commented. </p><p>“No, they were not,” she said. “The Lictor guards of the Senate intervened, and joined the battle against the Dacian School. Many gladiators fell, and the Dacian School came close to extinction before they could prove that the Senator had been killed by someone else, and they were the scapegoats, but that only prevented their further loss. Their name was tarnished, and many of their experienced Gladiators fell in the purge. From there, they inevitably fell to the bottom of the great four, and they are struggling to maintain their position against the second-tier schools.” </p><p>“Interesting,” I murmured. Not only the information, but the fact that Theodora had such detailed information about the events that happened in the background of Rome. That kind of political maneuvers was not the usual training material for anyone but the house heirs, and even then, only the really strong houses at the colonies or borders taught their heirs anything about Senate politics. “Are you a fan of the games?” I asked, curious whether her deep knowledge came from a particularly strong interest in the Gladiators. Her detailed information would make sense if she was a fan of the blood games.  </p><p>“Not particularly, no,” she said with a great distaste, before realizing her error. “I’m sorry, it’s not about you-” she tried to apologize before I cut her off with a wave of my hand. </p><p>“Calm down. I’m not a gladiator yet, and even if I was, there’s no shame in disliking proud warriors dying like circus freaks for the entertainment of the masses.” </p><p>“Right,” she said, nodding in approval. </p><p>“So, is there anything else you can tell me about Rome?” I said. “Since it seems that I’m going to be living there for a foreseeable future, I would like to know more about it. To avoid insulting an influential person, if nothing else,” I added. </p><p>“Of course,” she answered immediately, still driven by her need to compensate for my capture. “What do you want to know?” </p><p>“Well, you can start by what’s expected from a gladiator other than the obvious,” I said, as it seemed to be the best way to open the discussion before I could nudge her toward the politics of the noble houses without alerting her further. </p><p>She considered my question for a while. “The most dangerous part would be the invitations from the noble families, especially the Patrician families.” </p><p>“Really?” I said, surprised. “Why would they invite a slave to their precious home?” I asked. “Wouldn’t they be afraid of it being dirtied by the presence of a barbarian?”  </p><p>A snort escaped her mouth. “You’re underestimating the popularity of a gladiator, especially the successful ones,” she said. “The famous gladiators could even be invited as a guest of honor for the important events, like the birthday of a Patrician, or the birth of a new son,” she explained, before her nose was twirled in distaste. “And the handsome ones like you are always invited as secret guests for the parties exclusive for ladies,” she added. </p><p>“So, you think I’m handsome,” I cut in, watching as the blush covered her face while she spluttered, avoiding my gaze. I chuckled, even as I followed up with several questions about Rome, only to receive very detailed explanations for every single one of them, and the more she explained, the more a new plan started to shape in my mind. </p><p>However, as she explained, the mystery of Theodora deepened. Why was the daughter of a border noble, unimportant enough to be captured by slavers, knew so much about the internal structure of Rome? </p>",

    "content": "<p>On my lap, Helga’s smugness was almost palpable, highlighting her position on my lap as the superior case, like she was sitting on the throne of a queen. It would be a lie to say that if I didn’t puff up my pride. “Oh, Caesar, you’re so hard,” she gasped, unnecessarily loud under the current circumstances, clearly aimed at Cornelia’s jealousy rather than the pleasure she was feeling at the moment. </p><p>Under different circumstances, I wouldn’t have let that go without making Helga pay for such shenanigans, but considering her warped relationship with Cornelia, I decided to allow it. It was a good way to initiate a controlled confrontation between them. </p><p>And if Cornelia got competitive to steal the throne, well, I saw no drawback in that. </p><p>Cornelia didn’t look ready to act, at least in the beginning, so I turned my attention on Helga while Cornelia made up her mind. My fingers found the zipper of her skirt, and after a pull and a brief tumble, it was removed as well, and since her panties were already around her ankles, revealing her smooth crotch. Her corset was the only piece of clothing she had on her. </p><p>A silence filled the room when I pulled my shaft out, and slid between her plump thighs, her wetness rubbing against the topside. “So, Cornelia,” I said even as my fingers reached the strings that kept her corset in place, aware of Cornelia’s hungry gaze. After all, despite their rocky relationship, there was no doubt that Cornelia found Helga attractive —though I couldn’t help but think that Cornelia had a rather clear type she liked, as both Marianne and Helga was curvy and blonde— enjoying the way I was about to divest the last piece of clothing Helga was wearing to reveal her amazing tits. “Tell me, what do you think our plan should be?” </p><p>“Our plan,” Cornelia stammered, her eyes firmly on Helga’s cleavage, getting wider with every loosened string, her tits jiggling every time she moved up and down. </p><p>“Yes, our plan for the evening,” I repeated, using the tone of a disappointed teacher. “Try to focus, please, we’re dealing with something serious.” </p><p>The shape of Cornelia’s face was almost as enjoyable as the sudden tightening of Helga’s hips, enveloping my shaft within her plump thighs, who was clearly enjoying the teasing Cornelia was receiving. Though, if her vindicated expression was any indicator, she would have enjoyed even more if I had been resorting to chains and whips, but despite everything, Helga was a realist, willing to take whatever that was provided to her. “Sorry,” Cornelia stammered after a moment of silence, trying to get her grips with the situation, but failing rather spectacularly. </p><p>My presence, my relationship with Helga, the possible ambush she was walking in, and the show she was receiving… It wasn’t shocking that she was feeling a touch overwhelmed. I kept my gaze on her while my hands continued to work on Helga’s corset, and when I finally removed it, I threw it to Cornelia, which worked perfectly to pull her out of her dazed state. She pulled her eyes away from Helga’s tits, only to be caught by my gaze. </p><p>“Come on, why are you wasting our time? We’re facing a great disaster,” I said even as I cupped Helga’s breasts, making her moan gently. </p><p>“Sorry,” she stammered again. “What was the question?” </p><p>“The plan for the evening, about the possible ambush,” I said, not bothering to hide my mocking glare. To Cornelia’s frustration, however, I wasn’t the only one that was looking at her mockingly. Helga even let out a little giggle as she tightened the grip of her hips. While Cornelia tried to put together an answer, I squeezed Helga’s breasts, making her moan repeatedly. </p><p>“T-there’s not much we can do other than staying in defensive and saving most of our mana, ready for an ambush. We don’t know what we’re facing against,” Cornelia answered, managing to recover her calm after a slight stammer, trying to focus on the problem, which was rather hard with the amazing show that was going in front of her. Helga’s moans were getting louder as I teased her nipples, especially after she had established a quick silencing ward around the room, making sure that her commotion wouldn’t be heard by the rest of the inn. </p><p>“Really, that’s the best you can come up with,” Helga cut in, her voice rather louder than appropriate for a strategic meeting, but considering my fingers were dancing above her entrance, bringing her great pleasure, it was an acceptable flaw. </p><p>“Why don’t you show your ability, then,” Cornelia answered angrily, not appreciating the challenge she received. </p><p>“Sure,” Helga answered, her smile widening like she was waiting for that exact opportunity. However, rather than answering immediately, she raised her hips, only to lower them directly on top of my shaft, her wet lips enveloping my shaft. A loud grunt escaped my mouth, which might have been partially faked to annoy Cornelia further. Teasing her until she displayed her impotent anger was still fun, especially when her green eyes looked as bright as a forest fire. “Let me show you my skill,” Helga said as she lowered herself, taking half of my shaft in one smooth push. </p><p>“Go ahead,” Cornelia said, </p><p>“First of all, we need to assess the possible enemies. There are several options. They might have an undercover agent as a part of the group, they might have arranged a group of assassins on the mission location, ready to launch, or they might have been relying on faulty mission description, and the monsters in the location might have been much stronger…” Helga started, giving a rather detailed breakdown of the possible attacks. It wasn’t comprehensive, missing a couple of options, but considering she was trying to give said breakdown while trying to devour my thickness, it was an excusable oversight. </p><p>Especially since she was continuously receiving experience-gain notifications. I was increasing my mana transfer speed as I made sure there was no drawback to the process. </p><p>[-3721 Mana]</p><p>Cornelia didn’t seem to appreciate Helga’s relative eloquence, her face once again taking its usual stormy quality. Her hands twitched, signaling that she wanted to rely on her violent instincts to teach Helga a lesson, like all the times she had relied on that particular strategy, but my presence made that path impossible. </p><p>I wasn’t messing with Cornelia because it was fun. Well, at least, not just because it was fun. While the entertainment value of watching her usual arrogant attitude split between arousal and impotent anger was entertaining, I wanted her to have some experience reigning her anger. Otherwise, her uncle —who seemed to be a political animal based on my impressions— could easily manipulate her during their confrontation. </p><p>“So, Cornelia, what do you think our plan should be based on the updated risk assessment?” I asked even as I let my hands slip down Helga’s hips, leaving her amazing tits to dangle freely as she jumped up and down on my lap. Helga’s face was contorted with a smug sense of victory, complementing the thick layer of pleasure. </p><p>For a moment, I was sure that Cornelia would have exploded in anger, which would have disappointed me rather immensely. She even raised her hand like she was about to slap Helga, but then, she noticed my disappointed expression, and lowered her hand. “Good girl,” I said in approval, making her smile for a moment. </p><p>“We need to scout the area first…” Cornelia said, starting a lengthy tactical breakdown of the actions we could take, along with a detailed risk-benefit assessment, surprising me positively. Her explanation almost lasted ten minutes, near-flawless despite Helga’s increasingly frustrated attempts to distract her, ranging from heated kisses to earth-shattering moans. </p><p>She impressed me, because it wasn’t a dry explanation. She stood up at the beginning of her explanation, slowly unbuttoning the buttons of her robe one by one as she swayed with the music. Soon, her dark robe was pooled on the floor, revealing that she was only wearing panties and a corset underneath. “Daring,” I murmured, approving her approach to fashion —no matter how ill-advised was to dress like that for a mission— especially the way her black and crimson corset wrapped around her body, enhancing her cleavage spectacularly. </p><p>She might not have the spectacularly large bosom of Marianne, but that didn’t mean they weren’t gorgeous in their own way. She continued to dance as she explained, even shedding her panties, but deliberately leaving her corset on, which added to her sexiness. </p><p>“Impressive,” I said after her explanation finished, much to her satisfaction, and the displeasure of the blonde beauty that was doing her best to milk me, so much that if our relationship was any weaker, she would have walked away, or in minimum, exploded in anger. </p><p>“Thanks,” Cornelia said smugly, glad that she had managed to prove herself. </p><p>Helga wasn’t happy with the sudden reversal. So much that, even the fact that she had managed to gain a level while watching Cornelia’s delicious explanation didn’t manage to uplift her mood. She didn’t appreciate the sensation of losing, especially coming from someone she had positioned as a rival. </p><p>[Helga - Level 14/19 - 14%] </p><p>However, since lashing out was on her cards, she chose to channel her frustration in a different way. She cast a familiar spell on herself, cleaning and lubricating her backdoor entrance before a quick switch, enveloping me with her tightness despite the pained grunt that escaped her mouth. As far as distraction attempts went, it was a spectacular one. </p><p>Cornelia had many negative qualities. She was rash, quick to anger, and her perceptions were colored by a sense of superiority. However, no one could call her a quitter. Seeing the smugness on Helga’s otherwise strained face, she didn’t bother to comment, instead walked toward me in a deliberate slowness, her naked hips swaying with the grace of a dancer. </p><p>She was leveraging her recently-enhanced Agility to the limit, with rather spectacular results. </p><p>“Smug bitch,” Helga murmured as Cornelia climbed on the bed, hugging me from behind. </p><p>I silenced her with a stiff spank, making her ass jiggle beautifully. “Don’t be crass, sweetheart,” I said, which made Cornelia’s smug smile widen even more, which received a spank of her own. “And don’t focus on enjoying other people’s misfortunes,” I told Cornelia, before devouring her lips in a heated kiss. </p><p>It wasn’t the first kiss I shared with Cornelia, but it was the most heated one. Not only she was feeling aroused by the show she had been watching —not helped by her own striptease— but also she was fueled by the desire to prove her superiority to Helga. Her tongue danced freely, trying to dominate mine, the hopelessness of the skirmish doing nothing to blunt her enthusiasm.  </p><p>Helga was clearly unhappy with the shenanigans that were going behind her. Luckily, she had an easy solution for that. She stood up, only to make a half-turn before impaling herself with my erection again, facing me instead of pressing her back against my chest. The moment Cornelia pulled back for a breather, Helga took her place, her tongue just as aggressive. </p><p>“Bitch,” Cornelia murmured, but I could hear a faint hint of respect in her tone. The fact that Helga was willing to confront her directly slightly changing her opinion. </p><p>However, she showed her growing respect in a surprising manner. While Helga continued to devour my lips, Cornelia’s hands passed around my torso landed between Helga’s legs, directly on her soft entrance, which was currently empty. </p><p>Helga gasped in shock as she felt Cornelia’s fingers slipping inside, reflexively pulling back. It wasn’t the first time she felt Cornelia’s touch, of course, but highly likely, it was the first time she felt Cornelia’s touch tenderly. </p><p>Cornelia just smirked smugly as she took back her place on my lips, her tongue battling with mine while she rubbed her body against my back, her hard nipples creating a delicious sensation. “Bitch,” Helga murmured, repeating the earlier insult, but with a broken voice littered with moans, as neither Cornelia nor I stopped the impaling her, the double-assault taking its toll. Meanwhile, I rewarded Cornelia with another flood of mana, the transfer eased further by my improving Tantric skills and the potency of my mana. </p><p>[-1491 Mana]</p><p>[Cornelia - Level 17/25 - 95%] </p><p>Helga wanted to counter-attack, I was familiar enough to read that particular conviction on her face despite the pleasure that flooded her, but as she moved closer to the edge, mounting a counter-attack was starting to get harder. </p><p>“I’m-Going-to-Make-You-Pay!” she managed to shout as Cornelia’s fingers disappeared deeper into her wetness, unable to prevent herself from crying in pleasure after every single word. Admittedly, my repeated spanks to her ass or my girth, stretching her puckered hole to the limits as I impaled her furiously didn’t help her much, especially when I picked up speed to turn it into a furious assault. She was getting closer and closer to a final explosion.  </p><p>“Don’t be impatient, sweetie,” I whispered to Helga’s ear when Cornelia pulled away from my lips to focus on the dance of her fingers, while using her free hand to grab Helga’s breast, squeezing mercilessly. “We’re about to switch, and you can do whatever you want after that,” I added, and Cornelia missed that particular discussion, too focused on the amazing perkiness of Helga’s tits. </p><p>[Achievement: Peculiar Pacification.

    "content": "<p>Thanks to my ability to track the location of Cornelia and Helga, I managed to find their exact location in the town easily despite the chaos that filled the stress during lunch hour. They arrived in a street filled with inns, though, before choosing one, a small argument went between Iomene and Cornelia. The distance between us was considerable, but Cornelia’s body language was familiar. She was clearly unhappy with the quality of the inn, and demanding to go for a luxury one, only to be vetoed by Iomene, who ultimately won the argument, and led them into a more modest one. </p><p>Cornelia didn’t look too happy with that conclusion, as evidenced by her glowing hands like she was about to launch a fireball while Iomene walked away from her confidently. I shook my head in amusement at Cornelia’s attitude. It seemed that her rash arrogance was alive and well despite my lessons. She had just learned not to use that on me. </p><p>Rather than following them directly into the inn, I went for the back entrance —the windows. That close, I could find them with my eyes closed, so it wasn’t particularly hard to identify their exact location. An illusion spell allowed me to climb the wall of the inn while avoiding notice. The inn was warded against the intruders, of course, but to someone with my skill, it was no different than not existing. To the defense of the inn, it wasn’t exactly their fault. </p><p>It was hard to defend against someone that could erase the town itself singlehandedly if they were sufficiently motivated… </p><p>I expected them to be in their private rooms, and was trying to decide which one I should be talking about first, Cornelia or Helga. Surprisingly, I detected them staying close, even after they went into their room. Curious, I moved toward their room and perched under their window, once again relying on my magic to stay hidden. </p><p>A simple arcana mirror allowed me to spy inside their room, to check whether the whole team was sharing a room, only to realize Cornelia and Helga were sharing a single one, looking at each other silently, the atmosphere thick enough to cut with a knife. </p><p>To make things more interesting, neither of them was aware of my relationship with the other. Cornelia’s information about my greater aims had always been limited even though she had a good understanding of my abilities, and while Helga had a better view of both my abilities and my greater aims, I deliberately didn’t inform her about my relationship with Cornelia yet, wanting to leave that particular fight to a later, less sensitive time. Looking in hindsight, it might not be the best idea, as instead, it turned into a timed explosive at the most sensitive time possible. </p><p>Maybe I should stop procrastinating the important things. </p><p>I could have easily sneaked inside, but I stayed out, resting in a concealed spot in the outer walls, watching them through the spell. I was curious about how they would react to each other, so that I could resolve it more effectively. If I interjected immediately, I would suppress their argument, which would keep the issues suppressed until they explode. </p><p>Neither spoke until Helga quickly cast a silencing ward, missing the curious glance Cornelia sent to her way. Helga tried to keep her development hidden, but I knew from experience that it was hard to fake that after experiencing a comprehensible improvement. And Helga did so, both in Levels and in Stats. The fact that Cornelia had also experienced a radical jump in both, allowing her sensing abilities to transform significantly, made it virtually impossible for Helga to hide her abilities. At least, not without paying much more attention than the dismissive way she cast that particular ward. </p><p>“So, how have you been since our last meeting?” Cornelia asked, unable to prevent herself from adding a victorious and vicious edge to her smile despite the clear intrigue she felt at Helga’s proficient magical display. Her outburst against Iomene first, now this… It seemed that I failed to fuck mindless arrogance out of her, and simply taught her to never employ it against me. </p><p>Step by step, I sighed in surrender. </p><p>“I have been well,” Helga said curtly, sending Cornelia a haughty look before focusing on organizing her wardrobe, once again making me shake my head. Apparently, Cornelia wasn’t the only one suffering from excessive arrogance. I understood Helga’s point of view intimately, and to be fair, I had also experienced the arrogance of rapidly improving, which led me to rather ill-advised actions, but it was always easier to criticize the flaws of the others.  </p><p>Unsurprisingly, Cornelia didn’t appreciate the lip Helga was giving her, not since their latest meeting had included Helga being wrapped in chains while being whipped by Cornelia. Though, she managed to react it better than she did against Iomene’s decision, and didn’t threaten her with a spell. “I see it has been a while since we had a session, if you have forgotten your lessons enough to bark,” she said instead. It was direct and combative, but from what I observed, it was closest to diplomacy Cornelia could achieve against someone she saw as inferior, which was an achievement in itself. </p><p>They weren’t resorting to spells yet, which was a fortunate miracle. </p><p>If it was before, I would have just walked in and helped Helga to suppress her, to help her take revenge against the previous indignity she had suffered in Cornelia’s hands, but things had since changed. For better or worse, Cornelia managed to earn a place in my life as important as Helga in my life, which meant I couldn’t just help Helga break Cornelia. </p><p>Helga huffed in dismissal. “There’s not going to be another lesson,” Helga said decisively. </p><p>“So, you found another ‘sponsor’ then,” Cornelia countered, her tone bitter. “How enterprising.” I snorted at Cornelia’s statement, as she herself had no problem acquiring a ‘sponsor’ to resolve her leveling problem or helping her to power-level. Trying to shame Helga for the same thing was rather ridiculous. </p><p>“I did,” Helga said with a wide smirk, prideful in her achievement. She opened her mouth to continue to brag, but a moment later, she stopped, smart enough to realize bragging might have endangered my secrecy. Of course, Cornelia was in the know for most of those secrets, but Helga didn’t know that yet. “Too bad that despite all your beauty, you have all the charm of a porcupine, unable to get anyone unless you buy their loyalty first.”  </p><p>Cornelia snorted in dismissal, which was a rather uncharacteristic response. “If you say so,” she added, her disregard clear. I realized that Cornelia was measuring the imaginary new supporter of Helga, only for that portrait to come short against me severely. </p><p>I couldn’t help, a snort escaped my mouth as well, making the girls aware of my presence under their window. “Who’s there?” Cornelia jolted to action, her hand once again glowing with a flame spell, ready to lash out. Helga was not too slower, immediately crafting an arcana shield, reinforced by two ancillary wards and a third connection ward ready to connect it to the inn’s general wards, showing the extent of her development. </p><p>And impressive development, for both girls. </p><p>I could have easily escaped, but doing so would have been pointless. I had already learned what I wanted to learn by observing them. They didn’t have a burning hostility ready to explode, and the rest of their problems could be better mediated through my presence. </p><p>“Hi, girls,” I said as I pulled myself into the room. </p><p>“Caesar,” the girls said simultaneously with an elated tone, though it lasted only until they were able to process each other’s tone. “No! Not her!”  they said angrily, again, simultaneously. </p><p>“I love how smart you girls are,” I said, making sure to smile roguishly, earning a pair of blushes, their emotional fluctuations enough to defuse their anger for a moment, which was all I needed. I walked to one of the beds with deliberate slowness and sat down, while they just watched, trying to handle the sudden change of pacing. I patted both sides of me, and ordered. “Why don’t you girls take a seat. We have quite a few things to talk about.” </p><p>“No, that’s too much-” Cornelia started while Helga already took a step toward the seat I showed. </p><p>I cut her off quickly. “Sit,” I ordered, my tone stiff and demanding. Cornelia quickly caught up with Helga, triggered by my order. She looked frustrated, but underneath, her arousal was not to be hidden. She was getting triggered by her submission more and more, which was a weird combination with her still-existent sadist tendencies. </p><p>[+ 2 Speech]</p><p>“So, do you girls learned anything more about the mission?” I asked after they sat down, putting my hands on their thighs, one each, and squeezing gently. </p><p>“Nothing much, it’s just a routine cleansing mission, for a reported pack of shadow beasts making night raids. Apparently, they don’t want to have any problem while the undead crisis is going on,” Cornelia answered immediately, quick to take the role of team captain. Helga looked frustrated by her assumption, but a tight squeeze of her thigh was enough to silence her. </p><p>“I see,” I murmured, not particularly surprised by the lack of useful information, but it was better to check to be through. “So, you girls don’t find it suspicious?” </p><p>“Not particularly, no,” Helga murmured, but her tone was indecisive. “At least, not until you suddenly appeared. It seems like just another emergency mission, many other students had received such orders.” Cornelia looked equally confused and alert, their hostility forgotten in the face of immediate threat. </p><p>“Don’t you feel the exact configuration of the group is a bit suspicious?” I asked, while moving both of my hands at the same time, pulling their robes high. It was evidence of our closeness that neither girl was bothered the slightest by my wandering hands, caressing their naked thighs underneath their clothes. </p><p>Helga continued to look confused, while Cornelia realized what I was talking about after a moment of silence. “It’s an ambush for me,” she gasped in shock. </p><p>“That’s what I’m suspecting,” I said. </p><p>“What?” cut in Helga, her surprise understandable since she was lacking critical information. “Who exactly is targeting her, and why?” </p><p>I gestured to Cornelia, wordlessly suggesting that there was no problem mentioning the truth. “Probably a rival house,” Cornelia said instead, electing to keep her situation undercover. Which was rather pointless in my perspective, but I was willing to leave that as her choice. “The important thing is, how are they planning to achieve that? Do you think instructor Iomene is on their side?” </p><p>“Probably not,” I answered. “Frankly, there’s more than one way, but from the way they had arranged the group with students without a background, led by a foreign newcomer with almost no internal support, I’m inclined to expect a blunt approach, rather than a surgical strike.” </p><p>“Should we retreat?” asked Cornelia. “I still have enough pull to cancel a mission, at least.” </p><p>I smirked at her suggestion, even as I let my hand travel higher on their thighs, caressing the soft inner side, making Cornelia mewl in unexpected pleasure. Helga managed to hold on, but just barely, speaking instead. “We shouldn’t,” she suggested, but her tone was soft and indecisive, waiting for my approval. I nodded, and she continued. “Since they won’t be expecting Caesar’s presence, we can counter their plan, maybe even discovering the identity of the attacker.” </p><p>“Exactly,” I said even as I pulled Helga on my lap before sliding down her panties until they hit her ankles, leaving her core free for my assault. Cornelia’s expression of jealousy was just delicious. </p><p>“No need,” Cornelia bristled as she stood up and took a step toward the door. It wasn’t an ordinary step, but more of a stomp, highlighting her displeasure. She was jealous, not because I had another girl in my lap, but because that girl was someone inferior to Cornelia, at least in her own perception. “After my latest level up, I can take whatever they throw at me.” </p><p>“Really?” I said even as my hands danced over the buttons of Helga’s robe, removing it with a rapid movement, not making a move to stop Cornelia, even when her hand landed on the doorknob, signaling that she was about to leave. Rather than turning it and leaving, however, she looked back angrily, waiting for me to ask her to stay. Rather than catering to her ego, I decided to bait her instead. “So, you’re saying that you don’t need an additional level?” </p><p>“Another level?” Cornelia gasped with no small amount of shock, her fingers pulling away from the doorknob. “This soon? How’s that possible?” </p><p>“I’m a man of mysteries, of course,” I said even as my fingers shifted to the buttons of Helga’s shirt after quickly removing her robe, leaving her wearing only a corset and a skirt. Helga moaned in arousal, enjoying the treatment immensely. “Do you think that I would allow my maid to stay as a weakling?” </p><p>Cornelia bristled at being called a weakling —which wasn’t an entirely unjustified reaction considering she was likely stronger than half of the faculty after her latest level up— her face colored with anger, though even with that, her eyes danced on Helga’s body for an extended stretch. Neither her anger, nor her desire for more power didn’t prevent her from enjoying the view, it seemed. She said nothing for a moment, just watching as I started kissing Helga, our tongues dancing with an extended dance, while using the opportunity to transfer some mana, but rather than directly helping her to level up, I reinforced her soul space at first, strengthening her leveling. </p><p>[-1679 Mana]</p><p>Then, after a minute of heated kissing, I pulled back. “Sit down,” I ordered once again. Cornelia looked reluctant to follow my order, though considering she had no problem with that before, it was likely about looking weak in Helga’s presence, who she deemed as lower class. Still, her reluctance was nothing compared to my dominance. “Now,” I added, my tone once again sharp, and this time, she started walking closer, her aroused expression contrasting with her hesitant steps. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 30    Experience: 442500 / 465000 </p><p>Strength: 39    Charisma: 51</p><p>Precision: 33    Perception: 35</p><p>Agility: 33     Manipulation: 38</p><p>Speed: 32       Intelligence: 42</p><p>Endurance: 30      Wisdom: 44</p><p>HP: 5010 / 5010\tMana: 5765 / 6300        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Master Subterfuge [97/100]         </p><p>Master Arcana [91/100]        </p><p>Expert Speech [70/75]</p><p>Advanced Craft [50/50]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 17/25] </p><p>[Helga - Level 13/18] </p>",

    "content": "<p>Despite my hopes, Carrie’s shyness and hesitancy were quick to reassert themselves after she unveiled her blowjob abilities to my great acclaim. With her face burning abashedly, she was barely able to mumble a coherent answer after calming down, so I left her alone in the shower. And after she spent almost an hour there, she stepped out completely dressed. She closed in the distance between the shower and her car quick enough to qualify for the Olympics, staggering just enough to mumble something about being late to home, and her family getting worried. </p><p>I sent her off with a wave and a smile, even though I wanted her to stay back, and maybe give me a preview on the topic for our next tutoring meeting. </p><p>Since our first encounter had kept her away for a full day, I didn’t expect her to come to talk to me during school, especially since we didn’t share any class, which wasn’t as sad as it sounded. I wanted to be left alone so that I could focus on studying. Luckily, my attempts to disguise myself with loose clothing and crooked posture worked sufficiently, and none of the popular crowd tried to talk. The same could be said for the less popular cliques, though in their case, it was a dash of disinterest, mixed with the lack of confidence, especially as I casually dismissed a few half-assed attempts. </p><p>Of course, that didn’t mean I was successful in completely avoiding attention, as I saw Sarah observe me from a distance, like she was trying to decipher me, but I acted unaware. Our earlier talk had proved that she had a rather overdeveloped sense of protecting her friends. </p><p>I just hoped that Carrie kept her mouth shut about our ‘tutoring’ session in the shower, as I definitely didn’t want to handle the chaos it might create. </p><p>Carrie didn’t contact me for the rest of the day, even when I sent her a couple of casual messages, mostly to make sure she didn’t freak out after not hearing from me. </p><p>After the last class, I left immediately, as I didn’t expect anything to happen. And even if there was a chance for something happening, I couldn’t exactly delay my conditioning exercises just for that. So, I took the bus and went back home, turned on the music, and started exercising… As usual, I kept my phone on silent, not expecting any communication other than the nonsense chain messages from my old acquaintances. </p><p>So, I was rather surprised to find several unanswered calls, and a number of messages, filling my phone screen. I sighed even as I read the messages, which was jumping between casual and frantic, though funnily, leaning toward the casual as they progressed. I could even imagine her face as she texted them, no doubt feeling that she came too strong in her previous messages, wanting to clarify, only to push herself a deeper pit. She never mentioned anything about tutoring in her messages, but true to her personality, she managed to do that in a very noticeable way. It was like avoiding drawing a circle, only by coloring everything but the circle on the page. The end result was no different than a circle, only more striking. </p><p>As much as I enjoyed imagining her cutely fizzled, it was for the best if I could intervene early enough to prevent a self-implosion. </p><p>Unsurprisingly, she answered the phone before the first ring could properly complete. “Hey,” I said. “I just checked my phone, is everything okay?” I asked. </p><p>“Yes,” she immediately answered, loud enough to force me to keep the phone away from my ear. “Sorry,” she murmured, realizing her mistake. “I was just worried.” </p><p>“Thanks,” I answered. “Everything is well, I just don’t check my phone while exercising,” I said. </p><p>“You were exercising? Again?” </p><p>I chuckled. “That’s more or less a daily thing for me. Only on Sundays, I skip exercising, and that’s only to rest my muscles.” </p><p>“Isn’t it a lot?” she asked, which was a fair question, since I was yet to explain my ambition to be a professional player. Considering the focus I was showing on my studies, I doubted she even considered it. </p><p>“Yes, my muscles need the effort to stay in shape,” I answered instead, avoiding the need to explain that on the phone. It wasn’t a big secret, but if it became known in the school, there’s no way to avoid the attention of the school coach, to galvanize his own quarterback to work more if not for anything else, which would be followed by the said quarterbacks posturing, ruining my chances of avoiding attention completely. </p><p>“Really, that much?” she asked. </p><p>“Yes, really,” I answered, biting my lips not to mention how she liked my muscles, mostly because I wasn’t sure how well she could handle suggestive talk over the phone, even the tame kind. “So, how was the school today?” I asked. </p><p>She answered, then countered my general question by a very detailed assessment on each of my classes, in proper order, showing that she had already memorized my schedule. I would have been scared if I hadn’t already seen how scary her memory could be. If she could remember a passage from a book she read several months ago almost verbatim, she could memorize a simple schedule in a glance. </p><p>Moreover, she was too cute to be threatening. Just like in her texts, she was doing her best to avoid any mentions of tutoring sessions, but in the same noticeable way, grilling me on the hardest aspects of the topics, mentioning potential importance and I needed to repeat them to make sure I learned them… There was no doubt that she was egging me to ask for a tutoring session. </p><p>I might have ignored it if she didn’t have the cuteness of an awkward gazelle —or wasn’t as beautiful, if I’m being honest— but ultimately, I bit the bullet. “Actually, I’m having trouble with some of the formulas. Do you mind helping with them?” </p><p>“Sure,” she said immediately. “In the library, after the last class?” she asked. </p><p>“Actually, no, I have a date … with my exercise machines,” I said, giving just enough pause to give her the slightest scare. From the little gasp she failed to suppress during my little pause after the mention of a date, it was clear that it worked excellently. “Do you have anything to do tonight? Maybe you can drop by?” </p><p>“I don’t know,” she said hesitantly. “Isn’t it a bit late? And aren’t you exhausted after your exercise.” </p><p>“No worries, I just need a shower, and I’m about to step into it. I’m already naked,” I informed her. This time, she failed to hide her gasp, no doubt reliving the memories of the shower. And since I was feeling horny after the exercise, I decided to cut the discussion short. “I need to go before the hot water is gone, I’ll see you in twenty minutes,” I said, and before she could say anything else, closed the phone. </p><p>I was curious whether she would come just because she failed to argue her way out of it despite her hesitancy. </p><p>She answered that question a couple of minutes after I finished my shower, in the form of her car’s engine, rumbling at my driveway. I quickly pulled on a pair of shorts and a sleeveless shirt that put my muscular arms to the best effect. </p><p>I wanted to impress her, but when I opened the door, I couldn’t help my eyes widening in shock at the way Carrie dressed. Technically, she wasn’t dressed nicely, her clothing didn’t fit with each other, and was out-of-fashion for at least a couple of years, something even I could identify, and my knowledge of fashion came from the nuggets that managed to stick around as I half-heartedly listened to the detailed explanations of my various girlfriends. </p><p>Another disadvantage of dating with the cheerleaders almost exclusively. </p><p>However, the fact that her outfit didn’t fit her body completely, or the fact that it didn’t follow the arbitrary tenets of fashion was the least important thing. The first thing I noticed was her top, which obviously bought at least a couple of years ago, maybe more, and definitely had been worn repeatedly. I knew it was old, partially because of its faded colors, but more importantly, it wasn’t fitting her properly. It clearly belonged to a time before her latest growth spurt. </p><p>And it became much better through that simple fact. The shirt stretched in a way that wasn’t supposed to, revealing her curves like it was painted, displaying her curvy body perfectly. It might lack any kind of cleavage, but it didn’t need it in the first place. Moreover, as it stuck her body, it suggested that this time, her underwear was more interesting. I couldn’t wait to see with my own eyes. </p><p>Still, it couldn’t compare to her skirt. Unlike her top, it didn’t look really old, but it carried the familiar pattern of a generic pattern of a catholic schoolgirl skirt, but only quite a bit shorter than its supposed length. Rather than reaching to her knees like it was supposed to, it barely covered one-third of her beautiful thighs, giving a perfect display of her plump legs, tempting me to slide my hands under them and explore her hidden depths. </p><p>Overall, with the way she dressed, there was no doubt about her expectations about our tutoring session, so I decided to mess with her a bit, curious just how much she would be able to resist. “You’re here, perfect,” I murmured even as I grabbed her wrist and dragged her upstairs, and her face was alight with excitement, only to freeze with my next words. “I have a particularly annoying math question that was driving me crazy.” </p><p>“S-sure,” she stammered, unable to hide her disappointment at my lack of reaction. She said nothing as I led her toward the study, where my books were piled open in a corner, in a room where the rest of it was filled with two different TVs, a large whiteboard, and piles and piles of printouts about different football tactics. I took my football seriously. </p><p>“Your father must love football,” she murmured as she looked around, probably assuming all those stuff belonged to my father. Not a bad assumption, though inaccurate. </p><p>“He does,” I said, not wanting to go into that particular tangent right now, not when she was dressed perfectly. I was still feeling horny after the exercise, enough not to extend my little teasing game for too long. I sat on the only chair in the room, in front of the problems, and pointed at a circled question. “This is the one.” </p><p>“I see,” she murmured disappointedly, thinking that I was more interested in the question than her delicious body on display. She looked around, looking for a chair, but failed to find any. “I should go and find a chair-” she started only to be interrupted when I grabbed her waist and pulled her on my lap. </p><p>“Why bother?” I whispered huskily in her ear as I pulled her directly on my erection, sharp enough for her to feel despite layers of clothing between us. “Is this uncomfortable?” Predictably, she didn’t answer, freezing on my lap. I grabbed her hand, and much to her surprise, sensually dragged it toward the math problem. “This is the question? Please explain?” I whispered with a trembling, low growl that worked excellently to get the girls in the mood. </p><p>And Carrie was no exception, if her tempting shiver was any indicator. </p><p>“Umm,” she murmured, trying to gather her nerves, but when I asked a math question in the same rumbling tone, she managed to focus on her answer. Then, I asked another question, and she answered that as well. Then a third one… She wasn’t speaking particularly fast even in the beginning, clearly distracted by my rock-hard erection under her, but after the third question, the space between her words started to get larger and larger, even though I was the perfect gentleman… </p><p>Except for her seating arrangement, of course, but nobody is perfect. </p><p>“Should we move onto the physics homework,” I said to her as I pointed at the next book with my left hand —which was an important detail, because my right hand gently landed on her naked thigh, just where her skirt ended. </p><p>“S-sure,” she stammered, and immediately latched on the textbook as if she was trying to use it to distract herself from the situation. But her hips told a different story, and started to rock. It was a gentle movement at first, like she was trying to search for a better position to sit. Then, she searched again, and again, until it became an unending and tireless adventure, like a miner looking for the mother lode. </p><p>I took that as the permission I needed to put my other hand on her thighs as well, making her shiver in anticipation. Impressively, she managed to continue her explanation, though quite a bit staggered and with several interruptions where she tried to contain her moans. Her hips started to get wilder as my fingers caressed her inner thighs softly, closing into her wetness. </p><p>Then, her explanation was finally cut with a whimper that seriously threatened my willpower to take things slow when my fingers had finally discovered the edge of her panties, though I was barely able to hang out. Without the delicious release thanks to her treatment in the shower the last night, I doubted that I could have resisted the sweet temptation that was packed in her sweet whimper. </p><p>I let her enjoy the touch as I slowly danced at the borders, letting her anticipate my touch, without actually moving to the dangerous areas. Her hips started to get wilder and wilder, the rhythmic movements of her hips abandoning any pretense of searching for a better seating position. Another needy whimper escaped her mouth as I finally caressed her entrance over her panties, followed by an enthusiastic moan. She dropped the pen in her hand, closing her eyes to enjoy the sensation. I could feel the texture of her underwear, which, surprisingly, both smaller and thinner than I expected her to wear, even with her current outfit. </p><p>“Why did you stop?” I asked, which forced her to open her eyes, an incredulous expression on her face. “If you stop, I stop,” I whispered in the same throaty rasp that was driving her crazy, letting my fingers that were circling around her clit stall just to make sure she understood the threat completely. </p><p>“But-” she started, only to stop in alarm as I reduced the pressure of my fingers. Her panic was almost as delicious as her hips, still rocking desperately on my lap. “You’re evil,” she finally murmured as she grabbed the pen, followed by another moan as my fingers returned to their task. The next twenty minutes might have been one of the most sexually charged events of my life. I continued to caress her inner thighs and her slit over her panties, enjoying her increased wetness, but I made sure not to take the final step, not until her panties were drenched with her juices. </p><p>“How about the final formula?” I whispered, as I dragged my fingers, leaving a wet mark on the paper, the source of the said wetness no mystery to either of us. </p><p>“Do I have to?” she whispered, panting and gasping as I had just forced her to run several punishment rounds around the track. </p><p>“Yes,” I whispered, even as I finally slipped my hand inside the already deficient cover of her panties, caressing her naked skin. The resulting moan didn’t come as a surprise, but she managed to squeeze her teeth and continue her explanation about the latest physics problem I had asked her. </p><p>“Congratulations, you finished it,” I said even as I suddenly turned up the heat, my fingers abandoning their slow teasing approach in favor of a merciless assault. Already on the edge, it proved to be the only thing she needed to topple over the edge. She started trembling on my lap desperately, her moans louder than I expected, forcing me to kiss her to suppress her moans —not that it was a great chore by any means. </p><p>I pulled my hand out to let her catch her breath after her spectacular orgasm, which took quite a bit of time, as she slid down a bit, just enough to press her head against my chest, listening to my heartbeat. Meanwhile, I tried to decide what to do next. </p><p>Then, she surprised me by sliding down, and crouched between my legs, hooking her hands around my waistband, her blue eyes burning with a desire for revenge. “Now, it’s time for you to solve some practice questions,” she whispered, her tone promising a session of extended pleasure as torturous as she had just received… </p>",

    "content": "<p>The awkward silence in the room was rather thick, broken only by the exhausted gasping of Aria.</p><p>I didn’t know who was more shocked. Aria, who had once again caught in the middle of a steamy embrace, but this time even more compromising than the half-naked blowjob she had been doing as a cover for our other activities. Or Emma, who just caught the only princess of the Empire being mounted like a two-copper whore, moaning in endless pleasure as she climaxed freely. It was a tough competition in between.</p><p>While the girls were frozen, watching each other, I pulled out of Aria, my shaft doing its best to return back to life, but struggling to do so after the spectacular explosion I had just experienced. “So,” I said even as I stepped between them and stood in front of Emma, which meant she was looking at my naked body. I wasn’t exactly getting a bad view of her as well, because she managed to surprise me with her choice of dress. Instead of a formal and conservative one she could wear as she walked around the palace, she chose to wear a tighter black dress, with a rather deep cleavage that displayed her breasts perfectly. More impressively, underneath her dress, there was no corset to hide her breasts. It was more fit to a concubine waiting for the visit of his lord. It seemed that she was embracing the sexual aspect of our deal quicker than I expected. </p><p>“Since you’re here, should I assume that you have checked and validated the identity of the double agent?” </p><p>“Y-yeah,” Emma stuttered absentmindedly as her gaze dipped down, catching the sight of my growing shaft, which was glistening with Aria’s juices, like we needed another evidence of our rather spectacular lovemaking while Aria was still behind me, hiding using my figure, in her birthday suit. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said with a smirk, amused by her stutter. For a woman that could erase a small town with just a couple of spells, she was ridiculously shy —though clearly, not as shy as Aria. From what I remembered from our last time, where I had requested a delicious strip show in exchange for information —and payment for putting poor Aria in such a compromising position— she was rather quick to calm herself, but what she had seen was shocking enough to keep her distracted for a moment. </p><p>Which was the best time to push her limits. </p><p>“Tell me, what do you want next?” I asked even as I felt Aria’s naked body pressing against mine from my back, which made me smirk. The fact that Aria was using me as a cover seemed unimportant, but actually, it was extremely critical. It meant that she started to trust me immensely, so much that she was willing to rely on me to protect herself, rather than putting her dress back on. </p><p>“D-do I need to have a request to visit?” Emma stammered. It was a clear attempt of distraction, a common tool from the negotiation toolbox. My words were signaling that she was the one that wanted something, which would give me the leverage. Her words were a basic attempt to push back to it, attacking the central premise of my assumption, trying to make herself some room. She was clearly studying the art of politics. </p><p>Unfortunately for her, like many novices, she completely misapplied the shiny new tool she had acquired, hoping that it would solve a completely different problem. Just by visiting the next day, she had signaled the weakness of her hand —which was probably a result of Isolde’s important crusade, a rather sizable benefit for my situation. I wondered just how panicked Emma would be when Isolde returned with a great success…</p><p>And how much she would be willing to pay to equalize the situation. </p><p>The silence stretched for a long while, extremely uncomfortable for the two-thirds of the occupants of the room, while I enjoyed the sensation of Aria’s voluptuous tits on my back, creating a spectacularly comfortable sensation. Emma said nothing, Aria couldn’t say anything, and I was more than happy to let the silence stretch, the suspense getting thicker as the time progressed. </p><p>Ultimately, it was Emma that surrendered. “Yes, I need something,” she admitted, her usual demeanor trying to flicker back to the surface. I let my silence stretch further, letting her speak. Sometimes, the silence was the strongest negotiation tool when applied by the side with the initiative. This time, it barely took half a minute for her to continue. “I need to find more double agents,” she added. </p><p>“So, the arrest and interrogation have been successful,” I said, curious about the speed Emma had achieved the success. I had strong suspicions that she once again relied on mind magic, as she was still unaware of its danger. And since it was strong enough to work on the Dark Lord —or at least, that was what she had thought— why shouldn’t she use it on others. </p><p>Of course, that was not completely unpredictable, which was the reason for providing her one of the lower-level agents. From the way she subtly nodded to my statement when I mentioned the arrest, I could see that she had actually arrested the double agent, which was clearly a mistake. Not because it was undeserved, but because arresting a spy was always the most amateurish way to go, which meant anyone in the same cell would receive a warning and disappear, limiting the reach significantly. Following them for a couple of weeks to map their connections —and the connections of those connections as well— before busting all of them at the same time was the much better option. </p><p>Not that I wanted to explain that to her, not when I feed the spies and their safe houses one by one, slowly disarming the spies of the other Dark Factions in the capital while earning many benefits for me. </p><p>Best of all, the one that would realize my ploy immediately, the Queen, was distracted by the fear of losing her own secret. </p><p>“Good,” I said after another lengthy silence, which was quite enjoyable, as by hovering above her, I was getting a spectacular view of her cleavage. “But before we move onto that, you need to be punished.” </p><p>“For what?” Emma answered immediately as she looked up, her expression flickering between anger and rebellion. </p><p>“For entering to my room without knocking, of course,” I commented lazily. “It’s my place, after all, and I would like to think my station and achievements in life deserve at least that much respect, doesn’t it?” I said, not bothering to hide the mocking edge in my tone. </p><p>“It’s not your room, it’s your cell,” Emma lashed out quickly before she realized what she was saying, enraged by my shamelessness. I just let my smirk widen while her face reddened, realizing her mistake. “Sorry,” she immediately followed it up, but her expression told me that she was aware that it was already too late. </p><p>“Thanks for apologizing, but your rudeness is becoming a habit. It seems that we’re going to need another punishment just to push that.” </p><p>“But-” Emma tried to cut in, only to stop when I raised my hand in warning. </p><p>“No, it’s not just you have disrespected me, but you also scared poor shy Aria,” I added even as I hooked my arm around her waist, easily pulling her next to me, displaying her naked body to Emma. Lulled into a false sense of security during the standoff, Aria failed to react until she found her body in full display. A cute cry escaped her lips as she tried to use her arms to cover her body, which, considering her amazing curves, was rather unsuccessful. </p><p>“She shouldn’t have too much of a problem after being a whore,” Emma countered immediately, the sight of Aria’s naked body giving her a shot of courage. I wasn’t surprised by the sudden flip in her attitude. Sense of victory always bred overconfidence —a flaw that I wasn’t entirely free considering I had been captured and imprisoned— which led to her careless words. </p><p>“Such a rude girl,” I said, shaking my head in disapproval. Then, I turned to Aria. “Isn’t she?” </p><p>“S-she is,” Aria stammered, immediately answering despite her distracting efforts to cover herself with her arms. </p><p>“What should we do, then?” I asked her, ignoring the anger Emma was starting to develop at being ignored. </p><p>“I don’t know,” Aria murmured, blushing. </p><p>“What did we do the last time?” I asked immediately, before Emma could interject. </p><p>This time, Aria stalled for a moment. “P-punishment,” she finally uttered. </p><p>“Look here-” Emma started, jumping up to her feet when she realized the direction of our discussion, only to be cut short by me. </p><p>“Silence!” I ordered sharply. I didn’t shout, but rather I used the same tone I preferred whenever I ordered my soldiers in a battle. It was a tone that dismissed any possibility of denial. Emma shut up, stumbling back to her chair. I turned to Aria, smiling gently. “Go and stand behind Emma,” I said. </p><p>Aria did so, and for a moment, I enjoyed the sight while both girls stood frozen. Emma, sitting on a chair, wearing a black dress that barely covered her knees, and with an impressive cleavage. Aria, standing behind her, completely naked, her skin still reddened by the rush of being revealed. Interestingly, I could see Emma’s nipples hardening in anticipation, pushing against the thin fabric of her black dress domineeringly. </p><p>“Now, Aria, slip your hands into her cleavage, and grab her nipples,” I ordered. As much as making Aria spank Emma had been surprisingly erotic, it couldn’t rival the beauty of actual sexual touch. She hesitated until I throw her a stiff glare. </p><p>Then, I watched as Aria’s hands slowly pushed into Emma’s cleavage, making her shiver with the touch. She found my eyes, with a hint of rebellion dancing in them, no doubt considering the merits of stopping it, but ultimately, she stayed silent. Maybe it was the importance of the information she was seeking, or maybe, it was the fact that Aria was the one touching her like that, somehow making it less threatening. </p><p>Unfortunately for Emma, while Aria was the one touching, I was the one in command. “Now, twist them,” I ordered, and Aria once again followed my command. </p><p>Emma gasped. “Hey-” she started, making Aria flinch, but once again, I cut her off. </p><p>“Silence,” I ordered, before looking to Aria once more. “Now, squeeze them as hard as you can,” I added, and Emma’s pained grunts increased. Though, it was still on the level of discomfort rather than actual pain, as even with my orders, Aria lacked the determination to push until it stopped being erotic and started being just painful —exactly the reason I felt confident in giving her those orders. “Pull down the dress,” I told her a moment later, and one of Aria’s hands sneaked backward while Emma leaned forward, allowing Aria to access the zipper easily. Their implicit coordination made me glad, showing that they were adapting to their new roles perfectly. </p><p>My shaft was already in full mast, but seeing Emma’s naked tits together with Aria’s even more spectacular ones, it started throbbing painfully. I had no doubt that, if it wasn’t for the earlier session with Aria, I would have abandoned the punishment scheme for something more immediately gratifying. Instead, I watched as Aria slowly mauled Emma’s tits, leaving little pink marks behind. </p><p>Slowly, Emma’s expression of indignation melted, leaving its place to a sense of arousal. It wasn’t as apparent as the one on Aria’s face —who had been biting her lips in arousal for the last minute as she squeezed Emma’s tits, showing that despite all her submissive attitude, she enjoyed the opportunity to lash out, just like the previous time— but still, it was an interesting development. </p><p>And, I wanted to push the possibility to the limits. </p><p>“You’re not squeezing hard enough,” I said to Aria suddenly, making her freeze, her expression turning into abject panic, showing the fragility of her self-confidence once again. “You better start biting instead,” I said to her. </p><p>“B-biting,” Aria stammered, and while Emma said nothing, her shock was no less than Aria. “But-” she tried to continue. </p><p>“Yes, biting,” I cut her off, however, I didn’t use the same domineering tone I used against Emma, which would have broken her easily. </p><p>“Hey, that’s too much,” Emma commented while Aria walked in front of her, replacing my view with her shapely ass instead. </p><p>“Why?” I asked Emma while Aria leaned forward, putting her puffy nether lips to a great display as she bent down. “It’s just pain as a part of the punishment. It shouldn’t be any different than her fingers. Or, is there another reason you’re feeling self-conscious?” I questioned. </p><p>“Of course not!” Emma answered immediately, reacting just like I hoped. Her abrasive personality, which had been suppressed since she stepped into the room, finally had a chance to appear. And, true to her character, it exploded in the exactly worst situation, robbing her of her best argument to keep her punishment from straying into very dangerous territory. </p><p>“Then, what’s the problem,” I said, even as I patted Aria’s plump ass in lieu of ordering her to go forward, and her lips finally clasped around Emma’s nipples. Emma gasped in shock, realizing that her nipples were extra-sensitive after the punishing massage she just received. Then, using Emma’s distraction as an opportunity, I whispered to Aria while using a spell to prevent Emma from hearing it. “Use your lips and tongue more. I want to see that my teachings weren’t a waste,” I whispered to her, which made her stiffen for a moment. Meanwhile, I let my fingers trail down to her nether lips, caressing them gently to encourage her further. </p><p>From Emma’s shocked moans, it seemed that Aria was following my orders perfectly… </p><p>I just stood there, enjoying the show as I considered what to do next…</p>",

    "content": "<p>As we traveled back to the camp while being dragged down, I was listening to the excited chatter of the slavers, who were far too happy about capturing just another slave, making me think that there might be another reason for it. Unfortunately, none of them mentioned it, and I didn’t want to receive another hit, afraid that they would hit my face —not that I couldn’t cure them, but I really didn’t want to go all the trouble of faking a face wound, controlling my magic from healing the wound. </p><p>Since I had nothing else to do, I examined my surroundings. My observations of the slave traders didn’t yield as much as I had hoped, other than the fact that their weapons and equipment hadn’t been maintained for a while, and their clothes were showing the signs of wear and tear. They didn’t seem to be making big money recently… </p><p>Then, I turned my attention to the unlucky woman that inadvertently resulted in my temporary imprisonment. The first thing that really caught my attention was her skin color, a bit too dark to be living close by. Her hands were smooth and lacking callouses, suggesting she belonged to at least minor nobility like an Equestrian house or higher, not to mention her accent carried hints of Greek as well as Latin, but both with a high-brow accent, making it likely that she was Illyria or Dalmatia, as those border regions had the best interaction with the territories of the Eastern Roman Empire, which predominantly used Greek rather than Latin in their daily lives. </p><p>It also explained her complexion and the smooth facial lines. Illyria had a rather complicated lineage, a mixture of Italic, Celtic, Thracian, and Hellenistic tribes, some that still maintained their cultural identity, which was helped by the occasional border wars between the Roman Republic and Eastern Roman Empire, changing the ownership of the region about every hundred years or so, allowing the cities in the border to maintain their distinct identity. </p><p>Such a great contrast to Britanium, which was filled with wannabe little noble houses that only dreamed to copy the great Patrician Houses in Rome itself, like little children aspiring to be as brave and strong as their father… </p><p>Still, with a complicated region like that, I wouldn’t be surprised if she belonged to one of the noble houses on the borderlands, which meant there was definitely a story behind her capture. </p><p>But whatever the story was, the slavers wouldn’t care, as for them, she was nothing more than a pleasure slave that would be sold to the highest bidder. Which, admittedly, made great sense from a merciless commercial perspective. Not only she was spectacularly beautiful with her dark olive skin and strikingly elegant face of hers, but she also had the loveliest brown hair I had ever seen, somehow looking great even after a desperate escape. </p><p>The slavers would have made a great amount of money if they sold her successfully in Rome, as she was just beautiful and high-blood enough to get the attention of the younger scions looking for a permanent concubine —or a temporary plaything if they were both wasteful and cruel. It also explained why she didn’t have a slave stamp on her skin. It would have greatly devalued her as a pleasure slave. The slave marks were magical, and once settled, they were nigh-impossible to remove without killing the bearer. Only the mages with particular expertise on both healing and curse removal could do that, which was a difficult specialty to find, especially for a runaway slave. It was a rare service that was only afforded by a few elite slaves —like the trusted household scribes of some of the biggest generals and other officials, and even then, those slaves had to spend the majority of their savings on it rather than buying a villa in the countryside. </p><p>Of course, it went without saying that any Sorcerer was capable of removing such a mark, but considering their importance and rarity, it wasn’t exactly top of their list. </p><p>Since I didn’t share the same protection with my fellow female slave, the moment we arrived at the slaver camp —temporarily established to avoid midday heat— four men dragged me toward the fire they were cooking lunch, while the leader went to the biggest tent, and get out with a menacing piece of iron, which radiated oppressing, ugly energy in waves, as well as many links that traced from it to other destinations, ready to track any escaped slave.  The oppressive evilness intensified when the stamp was buried in the burning flames. </p><p>“Where should we stamp this animal, boss,” shouted the one I had wounded enthusiastically. “Let’s put it on his cheek, and ruin his fucking face forever,” he added, gleefully. </p><p>The leader’s response was a backhanded slap. “Idiot,” he called. “First, you let that Thracian warrior die from that wound after he tried to escape, then, you let the girl escape in your watch, and now, you want to ruin the merchandise. We’re lucky to find another potential Velites by luck, and you want to damage the merchandise immediately. Do you want to ruin me completely?” </p><p>“But-” he tried to argue, only to be silenced with another slap. </p><p>“Enough, go see the healer for your wound,” the leader ordered, and he left, but not without throwing an ugly look to my side, like I was responsible for his stupidity. But that was the nature of such small men, lashing out against the weak while obediently taking the abuse of their betters without a complaint… Only after he disappeared, the leader pulled the iron from the fire, which radiated both heat and evil energy. </p><p>I made a show of struggling against the men that were holding my arms and legs in place, but not enough to actually get free. The owner pressed the stamp on my hand, which was not as ugly as a face-stamp, but also very hard to hide in case of an escape. Luckily, they chose my left hand rather hand right hand, as I didn’t have to deal with a claw suddenly popping into existence. </p><p>Meanwhile, my attention was on the way the cursed mark tried to push itself into my skin, trying to stick into my skin like the oil of expired meat, stinky and disgusting. </p><p>While it was hard to separate the curse once it embedded into the body of the target, preventing it from embedding in was much easier. I just flared my magic, and it dispelled the ugly cloud of the curse. Of course, daring to brand me as a slave —even if the attempt was ultimately unsuccessful— couldn’t be allowed to pass without retaliation. Counterattacking to the branding iron was a simple job, as unlike a living target, I wouldn’t be trying to keep the target alive. Just a stab of mana was enough to permanently destabilize the magical matrix of it when done with my overwhelming magical strength.  It didn’t break immediately, but in a few days, it would turn into an inert piece of iron. </p><p>The leader stood in front of me once the healer finished tending the wound, rather carefully. He even gave me some painkillers, which was a surprising expense to go for a slave. The healer wasn’t a mage, which didn’t surprise me, as healers were a valuable commodity, and a struggling slaver group couldn’t afford to have multiple mages in their group, and the priority was always on the tracker and combat mages. Even then, I would be greatly surprised if they could afford anything but bottom feeders. After all, while slavery was a part of the society, slave traders still didn’t get any respect, treated as carrions. Useful, possibly rich, but ultimately, disgusting. </p><p>This was why, even when the famous generals enslaved thousands, they just sold them directly to the slave traders rather than auctioning those slaves on their own. Apparently, wholesaling whole villages and towns into slave traders was not a problem, it was the direct sale part that was dishonorable… </p><p>“Look, boy,” the leader said calmly, sharp enough to push through the pain. “You’re a slave now, and the sooner you accept that, the better,” he explained, his tone taking a fatherly tone, like it was something outside his control. Not bad, I surmised. His oratory skills were not bad, certainly enough to trick innocent villagers or trick tribal warriors. His tone radiated warmth and caring, which would contrast greatly with the mercilessness of his other members, and in a few weeks, the slave would latch on the comfort he displayed. </p><p>I said nothing, but struggled against my bindings, acting rebellious, which was only to be expected. If I calmed down immediately, it would be suspicious. He continued. “You’re really lucky, because we just lost one of the merchandise on the way, one that was promised to Ludus Dacicus, one of the greatest gladiators that ever competed in the divine land of Coliseum,” he explained, no doubt talking about the Thracian warrior that fell victim to their incompetent handling. </p><p>“So, you have a choice. If you can act obediently until we arrive at our destination, I’ll make sure that you find a new home. And believe me, it’s not a bad life. Great food, amazing fans, and you only need to fight a few times every year. If you are successful, you can earn your freedom back in a few years, rich enough to buy whatever you want, with many noblewomen dying to taste your cock…” he continued, spinning a great tale. I had to admit, I was impressed. If he was talking to another brave boy from a Thracian tribe like he was thinking, it would have been really effective. </p><p>“Only if I survive,” I countered rebelliously, once again following the persona I had created. </p><p>“Oh, I’m sure that a brave warrior like you, strong enough to take one of my men down in a second, and brave enough to challenge eight of us, wouldn’t have a problem taking down a few overfed Roman slaves, would you?” he said, just patronizing enough to awaken </p><p>“Never, not even if the gods ordered!” I answered showily. </p><p>“Perfect,” said the leader gladly. “Now, I’m hoping that you’re smart enough not to act out. Keep your head down and follow the commands of the guards, and you eat delicious meat every day, and maybe I’ll even send one of the female slaves to keep you company for the night,” he said before departing. </p><p>Then, one of the burlier guards dragged me toward a cage that was pulled by two horses. There were six cages in total, and four of them were filled with many slaves, split between genders. The fifth one, which was for me, was dedicated just for me, no doubt trying to avoid whatever that happened to the earlier warrior that they had promised to the gladiator school. No doubt they were that happy finding me. Not fulfilling an order from an important client from a gladiator school, even if it was an ancillary order, would have ruined them completely. </p><p>The sixth cage was dedicated to the female slave that tried to escape, but unlike me, she was even accompanied by a female attendant, likely to make sure her looks wouldn’t get damaged, or a horny guard wouldn’t damage her purity. </p><p>She looked at my bounded hand sadly, looking at the edge of tears. I smiled at her gently. “Don’t worry, it’s not the worst thing that happened to me,” I said to her gently, using a simple spell to keep her attendant from hearing it, a spell that was easily missed by any observer thanks to my smooth casting. It was even true, as, under the bindings, the wound was already cured, and ultimately, the slave caravan was going to Rome, which was my ultimate destination. </p><p>“Still, it’s my fault,” she cried, showing a gentle heart. It was rare for nobles to care about slaves, but no doubt her perspective was gentler after whatever misfortune that caused her to end up as a slave. </p><p>“No help crying after spilled milk,” I said. “And since we’re going to travel together, we should properly meet,” I added. “My name is Mikkos, what’s yours,” I said, just to deepen my fake identity while not getting too far away from Markus, which would give me a credible excuse if I answer someone using my real name. </p><p>“Theodora,” she answered, her tear-streaked face showing a gentle smile for the first time… </p>",

    "content": "<p>I stayed in the forge for a couple of hours, processing an incredible amount of material, enough for a small arsenal. A larger arsenal wouldn’t have hurt against the danger that was knocking on the door. </p><p>When I finally walked out of Oeyne’s room, the sun was finally appearing on the horizon, marking a new day. But it wasn’t just another day, because the guards were moving around with a great hurry in the courtyard, their alertness much higher. The magical sword gleamed on the waists of anyone on sufficient rank, signaling that the school had finally tapped into its legendary arsenal. </p><p>The headmistress must have decided that there was no merit in holding back completely, not after our little assault had already revealed our knowledge to the enemy. There were even several student teams dashing around, no doubt preparing for an incursion. Most of those teams were moving toward the training forests even though they were too strong to get any kind of benefit from a slaying few weak dire beasts. They were probably doing that to remove a potential weapon from the arsenal of the attackers. </p><p>The monsters in the training forest might not be the strongest, but if the wards that kept them separate from the school proper, it might prove a dangerous distraction at a critical moment. </p><p> Interestingly, however, despite the preventative measures, the school didn’t go to a full mobilization of the wards, which meant the classes would continue for any student without an assigned task rather than being pulled as a part of the standing army. Not yet, at least. Maybe it was about the politics, I surmised, not wanting to risk the students unless it was absolutely necessary. Or maybe, she was trying to bait them into attacking by showing she was underestimating them. A panicked attack from them before our intelligence about their plan had degraded —or they had discovered the changes made into the defensive wards of the school— could prove decisive. </p><p>Unfortunately, there was no undead presence out on the walls yet. </p><p>Funny, though, how quickly one’s perspective could change with power. I could never imagine preferring to have an undead army attack directly as soon as possible, so we could ‘handle’ them, rather than trying to escape as far as I could manage to avoid the backlash. </p><p>Unfortunately, I didn’t have time to waste on introspection on the physiological impact of overwhelming power, not when I was facing a danger that forced me to accumulate even more power.</p><p>Then, just as I was considering the relative merits of focusing on Marianne or Helga first to maximize the potential of our little group, I noticed something that made me shelve that little plan. A couple of familiar figures stepped outside as part of a small group. It was a group of students, a total of eight, following an instructor as they dashed toward the main gate in a great hurry. </p><p>Cornelia, and Helga. </p><p>That was a rather interesting combination, I noted as my suspicion tingled. As, other than Cornelia, every single student was a low-leveled commoner. Helga was the strongest of them in terms of combat potential, even before my help, and considering Helga’s reputation for combat abilities and the fact that her recent developments were still a secret, it was entirely too suspicious. </p><p>And the identity of the instructor did nothing to actually limit that suspicion. They were being led by was a young female instructor with a tight expression on her face, one that I recognized only through reputation. Her name was Iomene, and she was a part of the school of tracking. I knew exactly three things about her. She came from a distant corner of the continent that was outside of the Empire’s borders —which was more of a technicality rather than the actual ability to project military power— that was populated by many city-states, relying on trade to survive. She was an excellent tracker, and a decent warrior. </p><p>And, she was a complete outsider, her extreme standoffish attitude keeping her distant from everyone else, teachers and students alike. </p><p>In other words, the perfect candidate to blame for the loss of one of the most promising noble scions. </p><p>I had to admit, the ploy was rather incredible despite its transparency. With the chaos going on, it would be too late for anyone to notice any mistaken paperwork about the assignment, and in the aftermath, it was almost trivial to blame the mistake to one of the dead clerks —as it was almost certain to happen, and if by some luck all the clerks survived, the conspirator could easily nudge one of the less important ones to the other side, before destroying his reputation as a traitor, working against House Antony. </p><p>At first glance, it seemed like a simple ploy. Cornelia’s uncle was doubtlessly looking for a way to take control of the house without risking a duel. Cornelia’s lack of leveling was a conjecture of their part, after all, and even if that had been the case —as it would have been without my intervention— direct combat was too unpredictable, especially when facing someone like Cornelia, with a perchance toward overwhelming firepower. </p><p>House Antony was certainly important enough that more than one instructor would be interested arrange an assassination in exchange for future favors. </p><p>However, what made the trick really impressive was the quickness of implementation. It was almost like whomever responsible knew that a crisis was on the door, and already arranged everything, ready to be initiated! </p><p>Finally, a clue toward the identity of the mysterious owner of the shade, but whether direct or indirect, it was a mystery. It was a possibility that they were the same people —as someone would be willing to sell the defense secrets of the school wouldn’t have felt torn about sending a few more students to death. It might be also one of his subordinates, trying to create some ancillary benefit outside of the knowledge of his boss.</p><p>Unfortunately, it was unfortunately impossible to discount alternative possibilities, that either the plotter had learned the ploy accidentally, and decided to use for his benefit rather than reporting it. Moreover, it was always possible that he had a different plot in mind ready to go, and was adapting it for current circumstances. </p><p>Meaning, rather than intervening quickly, I needed to wait for the plot to unfold. And to prevent it from turning into a total disaster, I needed to follow them. After checking the general direction they were traveling, I dashed to my room, to see if there was any note from Helga. I found a quickly scribbled note from her, telling me that she had been assigned to an emergency mission, but they didn’t give her any detail. </p><p>Cornelia’s note, which was in her room, hidden under a new ward —no doubt to prevent her maid from investigating its contents. Her note was marginally more detailed than Helga’s, which was a good indicator of their relative difference of authority. Cornelia mentioned that they had been assigned with a mission to reinforce one of the nearby towns as a precaution, then scout the surrounding area for any dangerous monster build-up. She also mentioned that she didn’t know who would be in her team, but since the team was led by Iomene, she wasn’t too concerned, as she knew that Iomene was one of the instructors famous for staying away from house politics. </p><p>I shook my head at her lack of awareness. For an heiress that was about to be deposed, she could be dangerously optimistic in certain topics. On the surface, Iomene’s apolitical stance seemed to be in her benefit, but she failed to think that together with her lack of support, also made Iomene a perfect scapegoat for the loss of a noble scion —especially if she was unfortunate enough to fall under the ambush as well. Since Iomene wasn’t really famous for her strength and her skill set leaned toward tracking and hunting, I wouldn’t bet on her surviving an ambush that was designed to take down Cornelia. </p><p>Sneaking into their rooms and reading the notes barely took two minutes, which meant that the group was still visible from the gate. I followed them. Since Iomene was a dedicated ranger, it was difficult to follow them closely under the bright sunlight unless I started relying on my spells, so I let them open a bit of distance first. Yes, Iomene was skilled in erasing their tracks as well, but due to the nature of the mission, she didn’t bother to do so. Which meant that following them was a trivial job. </p><p>I was experimenting with my magic in subtle ways to kill some time, when I noticed that by focusing on Cornelia or Helga, I could actually detect their location. I didn’t know whether it was a benefit of one of my perks —like Teleportation, which I didn’t dare to use yet considering the disaster Empowerment had almost created— or just a feature of the completed companion system, but regardless, it was convenient to feel their presence. </p><p>Since I didn’t have anything else to do, I tried to replicate the same feat with Marianne and Aviada, but had mixed success. I could barely feel a subtle presence, but actually deciphering the location was much more challenging, strengthening the assumption that it was another benefit of the Companion system. So, I focused back on Cornelia and Helga, to understand the limits of the connection. To my surprise, it wasn’t limited to just location, but also I could sense their general state of mind. It wasn’t exactly detailed, but at least I could separate immediate fear from low-level combat awareness. </p><p>However, despite my convenient alarm system, I didn’t let them open the distance too much. I didn’t know whether there was an ambush waiting for them, or the spy had sent them away in the hopes of a lucky accident as the undead started to act. I followed them from a mile away, which was distant enough that I could subtly hunt whenever I noticed a worthwhile creature, while close enough that I could intervene with an elemental mount in seconds in case of an emergency. </p><p>Conveniently, at this point, it wasn’t too inconvenient to remove myself in case of an actual emergency. </p><p>They traveled for almost half a day before they arrived at a small town, Tertullian. While Iomene spoke with the guards at the gate, I sneaked into the town by jumping over the wall, using illusions for temporary invisibility. Invisibility wasn’t the best solution to stay unnoticed as it created shimmers as I moved, especially under bright light, but it was good enough to trick the lazy guards on the wall, who were more interested in their lunch than any possible intruder in the middle of the day. </p><p>Who would be crazy enough to jump over the walls in the middle of the day, after all? </p><p>The town itself was decently large considering the lack of farming or other direct economic activities. Essentially, the town was an overgrown trading post, standing on one of the main roads that connected Silver Spires with the nearest big city. It wasn’t enough to be classified as a proper city, or even a large town, though the strength of its walls and wards, as well as the military presence in the town, was worthy of a city. Likely, considering the proximity, the town was being supported by the Silver Spires, to make sure the trade flowed without a problem. </p><p>It was an interesting place to arrange an ambush. The town itself was supposed to be safe. Considering the relative safety of the town, and its location —it was to the North of the school, while the undead camp was to the South— it wasn’t likely to become a sacrifice under the undead horde as well. </p><p>Interesting, I surmised. So, either the spy didn’t know too much about the necromancer plot, or there was something else under wraps…</p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 30    Experience: 442500 / 465000 </p><p>Strength: 39    Charisma: 51</p><p>Precision: 33    Perception: 35</p><p>Agility: 33     Manipulation: 38</p><p>Speed: 32       Intelligence: 42</p><p>Endurance: 30      Wisdom: 44</p><p>HP: 5010 / 5010\tMana: 6300 / 6300        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Master Subterfuge [97/100]         </p><p>Master Arcana [91/100]        </p><p>Expert Speech [68/75]</p><p>Advanced Craft [50/50]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 17/25] </p><p>[Helga - Level 13/17] </p>",

    "content": "<p> “Watch carefully, you need to check whether I’m making any mistake,” I ordered Oeyne even as I cast a spell, levitating the glowing glob of liquid silver, flying in the air under my control, even as I used my earth magic to create a casting mold for the design I had in mind, mixed with some ice magic to ensure rapid cooling. Meanwhile, I saturated the earthen construct with my mana, letting my mana fill the structure of the silver, essentially testing the limits of casting. </p><p>[-267 Mana]</p><p>[+1 Craft]</p><p>“That’s one way to optimize -” Oeyne murmured, her voice strained, cutting short as I plunged deeper inside her tight hole, stretching her further. </p><p>“Yes, a wide range of magical abilities doesn’t exactly hurt,” I said lazily as I slapped her ass once more, watching her vast flesh ripple. At this point in our relationship, I was intentionally revealing some of my abilities, with the full knowledge that she would mention those abilities to the princess. It was an indirect method of elevating my value. </p><p>Otherwise, the trick I had just done didn’t achieve anything that couldn’t be done by any normal blacksmith, but it did save me almost half an hour in terms of time. It was especially important because, unlike a normal blacksmith, I didn’t have multiple pieces I had been working on to leverage the waiting time more efficiently. </p><p>And while playing with Oeyne while waiting was certainly tempting, with the growing undead pressure, wasn’t really in the mood for that. The sooner I finish with this trinket, the sooner I could move onto the other items on my agenda. It was particularly bad, because I had no idea when the necromancers or their mysterious backers would react to our rather outrageous assault. </p><p>They might react later in the day before we could restructure our defenses to factor in the presence of their dangerous leader, or they might attack a week later, with a completely different plan. It was for the best if I prepare accordingly. </p><p>Oeyne was busy moaning under my repeated teasing as I broke the mold, floating the cold piece of silver toward me, along with a large hammer that would be used for shaping the silver further. Working on silver wasn’t as scary as it might sound, because, unlike iron and steel, most of the work was done through cold smithing, meaning there wouldn’t be inconvenient flying globs of burning metal or other dangerous features. </p><p>Not that iron smithing would have been too dangerous, as I was confident in my abilities to protect us, but still, it would have prevented me from enjoying Oeyne’s deliciously tight grip. </p><p>I raised the hammer even as I gathered a generous amount of mana, quite a bit more than what Oeyne had recommended earlier. “That’s too much-” Oeyne tried to speak, but I slammed the hammer down, leaving a strong dent on the circle-shaped silver piece, the ringing of the hammer suppressing her voice. </p><p>[-196 Mana]</p><p>[+1 Craft]</p><p>“Impossible,” she tried to speak once more as I raised my hammer, no doubt trying to communicate her disbelief as I raised the hammer again, the mana safely injected into the silver, obediently soaking into its internal structure. Her shock was understandable, as I imbued the hammer quite a bit more than what could be deemed safe. Any ordinary blacksmith —assuming one strong enough to gather sufficient mana in the first place— would have created an unstable explosion that destroyed the hammer along with a good part of their arm, and I doubted that even Oeyne could handle injecting that much amount of mana with one hit </p><p>Though, she certainly had the skill to create a stronger item with less mana. What I was doing was essentially bullying the mana through my exceptional mana control, which I owed mostly to Tantric, and skipping several necessary steps. Essentially, if I could perfect it, I could forge a decent magical weapon in minutes rather than hours and days others would require. That wouldn’t change the mana requirements, of course, which might be a reason why there was no such recorded technique. Usually, blacksmiths and other crafters lacked mana and materials, not time. </p><p>Still, I was glad that my experiment didn’t blow on my face. </p><p>Oeyne opened her mouth even as she watched the piece of silver, no doubt about to inquire more about the near-impossible success I had just achieved, only to gasp in shock as I impaled her hard, forcing her to deliver a delicious moan instead. And just as she was about to gather her wits, I slammed the hammer again, once again imbuing the silver circlet with more mana. </p><p>[-206 Mana]</p><p>[+1 Craft]</p><p>Oeyne attempted to speak once more, only to receive the same treatment again, my shaft invading her tight hole rather aggressively, until she let out a delicious moan, the sound of our flesh colliding mixing with her moans. The assault of pleasure worked even better than the sound of the hammer to suppress her attempts to talk. </p><p>Just like that, the moment fell into a predictable rhythm, each slam of the hammer imbuing more and more mana to the silver circle, strengthening the material both physically and conceptually, all the while I enjoyed Oeyne’s cries, indicating that the pleasure was building up spectacularly.</p><p>And what a build-up that was. As my shaft delved into the deepest recesses of her body, her moans turned into a boundless river, constantly flowing out, mixing with the silvery rings of the smithing hammer. There was only one problem with the position, as I couldn’t continue smithing and explore her body with my fingers at the same time. </p><p>Still, that didn’t mean I was completely helpless. </p><p>It was difficult to split my magical attention further, but using a simple arcana spell was still within my limits. I let my spell free, squeezing her breasts aggressively through a phantasmal hand, intensifying her moans further. All the while, I continued to forge, until the silver piece I was working on had soaked as much mana it could structurally handle without exploding despite my efforts to keep it contained. </p><p>[-1206 Mana]</p><p>[+2 Craft]</p><p>It was finally time to shape the enchantments. If I had been creating a sword, it wouldn’t have been that challenging in terms of enchantment, because unless the aim was to embed an exotic effect, the strengthening conceptual strength would have allowed the sword to be sharp enough to cut through the defenses that would normally resist such a blow, even from magically-reinforced steel. </p><p>It was a bit trickier when it came to the choker. The effect I was trying to create was different, so when I changed to a fine finishing hammer, I also connected directly with the mana, tying the whole mana structure under a Biomancy spell, creating a permanent obscuring effect that would help her to hide from death-energy based detection spells, as well as giving her some protection against surprise attacks.</p><p> Facing the potential necromancer invasion, some extra protection wouldn’t be amiss. </p><p>As I slowly shaped the enchantments, which required focus on fine control, both that I had in spades thanks to my monstrous stats, so much that I was once again able to turn my attention back to Oeyne, who had been watching my achievements with a dazed expression, the shock from my capabilities, combined with the pleasure that was filling her whole being, distracting her quite a bit. </p><p>Since she had no problems with my exceptional drilling, I continued the treatment, slamming harder and harder inside her, testing the limits of the lubrication I had applied earlier, while the arcana spell still caressing her body, pushing her closer to a climax. </p><p>Her moans rose even further, gaining a surprisingly melodic quality as she abandoned all attempts to contain her own voice even a bit. It was a pity I missed the expression on her face, as it was no doubt spectacular, but I didn’t conjure a mirror to watch her. Mostly because I was already dealing with too many things, and we were in a tricky part of the process. So, I let her drown in her own euphoria while I finished tying down the achievement, which stretched my capabilities to the limit. </p><p>I even added some precious reagents from my pack, including a core fragment from one of the crystal monsters, its diamond-like skin perfect for containing the pure spell. After a few soft touches, the item was done, other than polishing to add a spectacular shine, but once again, my magic helped me to skip that exhaustingly time-consuming step, replicating the effect with a simple earth spell. Since the enchantments were yet to settle, it was easy to repair it magically. </p><p>It wouldn’t be the case a few minutes later, hence the reason for the easily disposable nature of the magical weapons. Once the underlying mana structure was broken, it was near impossible to repair one. And even without being broken, while maintenance was simpler than crafting from scratch, it also carried a spectacular risk of backlash if the blacksmith failed at any step. </p><p>The satisfaction of completing my first proper magical item was overwhelming, but not as much as the way Oeyne tightened around my shaft once she saw the resulting item, climaxing spectacularly. Apparently, my successful display of skills had worked even better than my other seduction attempts. </p><p>A rare kink, not that I was complaining, as Oeyne’s tightness was enough to trigger my own climax, allowing her tightening bowels to milk me, my grunts accompanied her moans. And just to make things even more perfect, a notification rang. </p><p>[Achievement: Superb Smithing. Hard work and superb craftsmanship is its own reward, but sometimes with some extras. +1000 Experience, +3 Strength]</p><p>Once again, the achievement managed to put a smile on my face. It was nice to know that whatever the source of my unique variation of System, at least it had a working sense of humor. </p><p>“So, how was it?” I asked even as I pulled out of Oeyne, finally slapping her ass, making it jiggle. “Do I get a passing grade?” </p><p>Oeyne tried to stand up, which worked more or less as intended while she pushed against the stone surface of her forge, but hit a snag once she tried to rely on her legs exclusively. A sudden aftershock hit her, making her collapse on the floor, with her ass on the floor. “Would you mind helping me?” she gasped. </p><p>“Nope,” I answered even as I cast a water spell, quickly cleaning my shaft before I took a step toward her. Elemental spells were useful, and not just for skipping time-intensive aspects of forging. “I’m going to forge a few more trinkets to make sure I learned perfectly,” I said, then looked down with a teasing smile. “I’m sure you can find something to occupy yourself with…” </p><p>What I meant was rather clear, especially as when I took a step, my shaft stood inches away from her plump lips, growing rapidly as it begged for her attention. She was quick to follow the clue, and wrapped her plump lips around my shaft, devouring half of it with relative ease, while I started working on another set of silver jewelry, this time creating small bracelets, each with a different design. However, their design had one major difference, focusing more on defense and protection rather than saving them from detection, as for them, it was a higher priority. </p><p>I was lucky that the design of the others was relatively easier after the first attempt, which meant when Oeyne pulled back to leave my shaft free for a moment, only to rise just a bit and lean forward, only to capture my shaft between her caramel tits. With the soft skin of her breasts massaging my well-lubricated cock as she slowly moved up and down, it generated a lovely feeling, almost as lovely as the tight grip of her puckered hole. </p><p>However, it was even more distracting, because, unlike the previous time, I wasn’t the one in control, meaning whenever she leaned down to lick the crown of my shaft for some extra pleasure, it worked spectacularly. Under the entertaining distraction provided by her soft globes, the forging both passed too quickly, and somehow managed to extend in an eternity, her throaty moans almost as reliable as a clock counting seconds… </p><p>As she squeezed and loosened the grip of her breast to alternate the sensation, it barely took minutes for me to explode on her face, but luckily, using her advanced forge, it was more than what I needed to finish four protective bracelets. I groaned as I exploded, adding some milk to her caramel. </p><p>“It has been a productive lesson,” I murmured even as I grabbed her hand offered her help to stand up, but she shook her head, preferring to stay collapsed next to her forge, enjoying the aftermath of her latest climax. </p><p>“Yeah,” she murmured, trying to recover from the high of her arousal, but not being particularly successful about it. “Will you come again?” she suddenly asked. </p><p>“Well, that entirely depends on your skill,” I chose to answer, enjoying her blush against the double entendre that was created. “But yeah, I’ll make sure to drop by, to enjoy another beautiful lesson if nothing else. But make sure to send me the news if there’s any change with the princess situation,” I added, reminding her of the more serious aspects of our situation. </p><p>“Definitely,” she answered even as she tried to stand up, but I gestured her to rest. I didn’t need her help getting in, and leaving was even easier. </p><p>Just as I was about to leave, when I remembered something very important. I had lost my weapon against the death knights when I used it as an explosive weapon, meaning I needed replacement. And while I was getting more able, and could apply a number of really tricky effects without the assistance of an enchanter, I still couldn’t match Oeyne when it came to straightforward weaponsmithing. </p><p>“Also, please forge me another weapon, a sword this time, and maybe a couple of daggers,” I asked her directly, not even bothering to soften the request. Considering everything we were doing, a straightforward order wasn’t something to be discussed in detail. Especially not when I was concerned with price. </p><p>“Sure,” she murmured as she finally made an attempt to stand up, and I helped by presenting my hand. She grabbed and pulled herself upright. “I’m a bit beat, though, why don’t you prepare the materials, and I’ll start them as soon as I wake up.”  </p><p>“Excellent,” I said even as I caressed her cheek gently. She smiled naughtily before she stumbled toward her bedroom, somehow managing to add a delicious swing to her hips despite her trembling legs… </p><p>As much as I was tempted to follow her there, I stayed on the forge to process the required magical reagents instead. I still had undead to purge, and dangerous political intrigues to counter. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 30    Experience: 442500 / 465000 </p><p>Strength: 39    Charisma: 51</p><p>Precision: 33    Perception: 35</p><p>Agility: 33     Manipulation: 38</p><p>Speed: 32       Intelligence: 42</p><p>Endurance: 30      Wisdom: 44</p><p>HP: 5010 / 5010\tMana: 1871 / 6300        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Master Subterfuge [97/100]         </p><p>Master Arcana [91/100]        </p><p>Expert Speech [68/75]</p><p>Advanced Craft [50/50]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 17/25] </p><p>[Helga - Level 13/17] </p>",

    "content": "<p>Admittedly, what I had just done was quite evil, stopping just as she was about to experience her first climax where her fingers hadn’t played both the main and the supporting parts. I stopped, just as she was about to climax under my treatment, leaving her panting and in disappointment. I even declared that I would follow her to make sure she wouldn’t have a solo flight to solve her problem. </p><p>Of course, while it was evil, it was certainly not undeserved after all those secret nighttime visits that went quite a bit farther than what was acceptable, and that was putting in the mildest terms. After her actions, she deserved punishment, but since her misdemeanor was so enjoyable, I needed to make sure her punishment was just as fun. She might feel frustrated in the beginning, but there was a big pot of gold on the end of that particular grueling road. </p><p>We returned to the RV silently, and I caught Anna looking at the bathroom with a great determination, no doubt thinking that it was the only place she could hide away from my gaze. But a gaze and a knowing smile from me were enough to dissuade her from that. With her shyness, it was impossible for her to actually do that when she actually knew that I was aware of what she had in mind. </p><p>A rather stark contrast to her extreme actions on the times she thought that I wasn’t paying attention, but ultimately, it was a part of her charm. </p><p>I sat on one of the chairs, once again doodling on my notebook, drawing various quick sketches, all of them using Anna in her provocative skirt as a material, though not all of the drawings included her while wearing all of her clothes. Some depicted her without the shirt, relying on her flimsy bra to cover her tits, while the others omitted the bra instead. One of them even omitted everything but the skirt, showing her desperately using her arms to cover her tits. </p><p>I couldn’t wait to ask her to model for those exact poses. </p><p>Meanwhile, she once again grabbed her book and tried to find an innocent pose to read, which was impossible to achieve with her current clothing. In the end, she found the solution by displaying a side-view to me, which made sure I wouldn’t get the full benefit of her skirt mishaps or her deep cleavage. That also meant I had a perfect angle to assess the exact level of hardness of her nipples, but ultimately, it was a good trade-off. </p><p>However, things began to change after about half an hour of silence. As I watched from the corner of my eyes, I could almost see the real-time improvement of her self-confidence as she got used to the unfamiliar coverage —or lack of coverage— of her new clothes, her posture slowly changing. First, her shoulders lost their slouch, then her eyes finally moved away from the book, occasionally even looking at my way. </p><p>The real change, however, came just after an hour, when she changed her position slightly, looking at me more directly. Her legs parted a bit, just enough to give me a glimpse of her wet core wrapped in the insufficient protection of her transparent panties, though the shadow of her skirt made sure that I could only get a fleeting glimpse of it. And from that angle, her cleavage looked perfect enough to feast. </p><p>However, as much as I loved the physical aspects of the show, the thing that impressed me most was her blue eyes, burning with a frustrated challenge, daring me to ignore her. She even smiled in victory when our eyes met, unaware that she was giving me the perfect chance to counter-attack. </p><p>“Don’t move, even a bit,” I warned her even as I stood up, and quickly grabbed my canvas and paints, much to her shocked gaze. “The lighting is perfect. I don’t want to miss it.” </p><p>Just like that, her sense of challenge evaporated, leaving its place to panic, though her arousal didn’t move even a bit. “Raise your head just a bit,” I ordered as I dipped my brush in paint, letting it dance on the canvas quickly. I wasn’t being a perfectionist as I paint, not wanting to lose the heat of the moment. Twenty minutes with her heat still alive was much better than five hours and a stiff and bored model. I wanted to capture her emotions, her desire, her soul…</p><p>She followed my order and didn’t move, her face still frozen in that delicious mixture of fear and desire, while I stretched my abilities to the limit to immortalize her unique beauty, afraid of losing the moment. As much as I wanted to paint the rest of her beautiful body, I had to ignore that part, as based on the way our relationship was going, it wasn’t impossible to ask her to dress the same at a later date. </p><p>No, I wanted to capture the light dancing in her beautiful blue eyes, the curve of her beautiful lips that communicated her youthful excitement, the blushed cheeks that indicated her quickened heartbeat. Even more, I wanted to draw her dreams of finally breaking through her restrictive cocoon to blossom into a confident woman that owned her body and her desires, and the poetic contrast it created at the moment, a mind ruled by fears and desires of her body… </p><p>Even as I drew, a wave started to gather in the center of my chest, begging me to throw everything down and take a step forward, help her take the last step to freedom. My shaft hardened like never before, turning into true torture. </p><p>If it wasn’t for the arrogance that drove me to perfection in anything I chose, from my chosen career to my obsessive need for bodily perfection, I would have followed my desires and pressed my body against hers. I could already imagine the way her legs would wrap my waist if I did so, our hands free to explore each other. Ultimately, however, I managed to hold back, and focused on my painting. </p><p>Fifteen minutes of furious painting later, I finally talked. “Finished,” I said, letting out an exhausted breath, but my eyes were locked on the painting I had just created. I would have expected the dilemma I had been going through to distract me, resulting in a substandard painting, but it turned out to be the opposite. I had just created my most perfect painting. </p><p>It wasn’t just lifelike, as being lifelike implied being photographic, perfect to every little detail, yet still and lifeless. The painting was different. It had many imperfections, from smudges to accidental touches, but they somehow aggregated to add a supernatural sense of reality to the painting, somehow helping it to ascend reality. </p><p>“How’s it?” Anna asked, once again her shyness back as she stood up, unable to process my unusual reaction. </p><p>“Why don’t you come and take a look,” I answered. </p><p>She did so, each step hesitant, afraid of what she would find as she failed to read my reaction. When she finally stepped next to me, however, she froze in shock, her blue eyes shimmering like sapphires. “It’s beautiful,” she whispered. </p><p>“You’re my muse,” I whispered, still overwhelmed with my own creation. It was the best I had ever done, and not just by a small margin. It literally existed at an elevated level, one I had never thought I could have reached this soon in my career. Certainly not during with a fifteen minutes painting. </p><p>She smiled at my words. “Really-” she tried to say, but her words were cut short, because I silenced her with a searing kiss, my lips devouring hers aggressively. After inspiring me to this degree, she earned her reward. It wasn’t like the previous kiss we had shared, which was, despite all the naughty things it implied, ultimately tame and calm. This time, my lips launched a domineering assault.</p><p>Since it was a reward, the decent thing to do was to make sure it was a spectacular reward.  </p><p>And I did reward her, repeatedly…</p><p>Five minutes later, when I finally pulled back, Anna was panting hard, even though I hadn’t let my hands join the fray, just holding her waist softly. Her expression was numb, though that didn’t alarm me, as I recognized that numbness. It wasn’t an expression that came from a negative place. It only occurred when one’s mind was blanked with pleasure repeatedly, only to end up losing the sensitivity to anything for a fleeting moment, unable to force their brains to restart. </p><p>Just like trying to remember a dream… </p><p>“Nice painting,” she murmured, overwhelmed by the kiss, and admittedly, I wasn’t too far behind. I did enjoy the kiss, probably more than what was proper, but unlike her, I was able to hide the impact. She took a step back as she forced herself to breathe, trying to still her trembling legs. In her eyes, I could read the battle of her desire, her fear, and many other emotions flickering to join in. </p><p>As much as I loved to see that expression on her face, I could also see that she was just a step away from collapsing, overwhelmed by the rush of unfamiliarity. So, I acted quickly to prevent that particular track. “Do you mind helping me to cook lunch?” I offered even as I pointed at the small sink and board that functioned as the kitchen. </p><p>Far too small for two people to cook comfortably. </p><p>Which, of course, was a nice bonus, as the possibility of such close physical contact was just erotic enough to pull her mind from the spiral she was about to disappear into. “I-” she started, but before she could continue, I grabbed her hand and led her toward the small section that we marked as the kitchen. “Would you mind dicing those,” I whispered as I passed a couple of tomatoes to her, making sure our fingers touched liberally. </p><p>She started immediately, more than happy to have something to distract her from her current situation. When she bent over a bit to better grab the cutting board, however, her micro skirt moved up, revealing most of her ass, which was incredibly much considering her transparent panties weren’t up to the task of covering her modesty, not to mention her hips were wide enough to make the attempt rather challenging in the first place. </p><p>Which immediately made me abandon my initial plans of letting her relax. After all, in life, some temptations were too hard to resist. Anna’s ass, clad in her transparent red panties, barely contained with a micro-skirt was one of those. As she reached, forgetting or ignoring her current mode of dress, my self-control frayed further. I took a step behind her while she washed the tomatoes and grabbed a knife, enjoying the way her hips danced whenever she leaned forward. Still, I needed to something more. </p><p>The excuse presented itself in the way she was holding a knife. “Stop,” I called her even as I took the last step to dwindle the distance between us to nothing, locking her body between mine and the kitchen sink.</p><p>“W-what’s wrong,” she stammered, caught flatfooted by my sudden closeness. </p><p>“You’re holding the knife wrong,” I said even as I took the knife off her hand, and displayed the proper way of handling it. “You need to use two fingers to pin the blade, and use a circular motion to slice up the tomatoes. Just pressing will bruise the tomatoes,” I explained, before leaning forward to show her by example. </p><p>However, rather than focusing on my display, she whimpered helplessly, as she didn’t bother to change positions, meaning she was still locked with mine pressed behind her, my erection hard enough to be felt as I pressed against her almost-naked ass. “Got it?” I asked after finishing it with one tomato, and passed the knife to her, only for her to fail spectacularly. </p><p>“Pay attention,” I admonished her, which she shyly accepted. “Let me show you properly,” I said as I grabbed her wrists and gently directing her to follow a soft, circular motion with the knife, while I also replicated the same with my hips, rubbing against her ass repeatedly. She whimpered helplessly as she tried to focus on my teachings, only to get right after three more explanations. “Next time, try to listen more carefully,” I said, punctuating it with a gentle pat to her ass before pulling back, once again leaving her on the edge, panting and gasping. </p><p>“I understand,” she gasped, her voice worse than any siren call. I was tempted to bend her over the small dining table to take her right there, something she seemed to be extremely amenable. Somehow, I achieved a miracle, and stepped back. Not because of any moral complications or not desiring her, but purely because I was curious about how she would react once I went to ‘sleep’. </p><p>After that, neither of us said anything of importance for the rest of the preparation. The rest of the day passed at a weird pace, somehow both too slow and too fast at the same time, though I enjoyed interrupting her attempts to have a private time several times. Normally, keeping someone under observation would have been a boring activity, but if the target of the observation was a shy voluptuous blonde in a skimpy skirt, her attention split between hiding her frustration and trying to resolve her arousal… </p><p>Yeah, it was a fun day… </p><p>Then, the evening arrived, and without saying anything, I pulled the curtains and undressed, waiting for her visit with closed eyes… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Watching Aria on my lap after a ferocious ride was a rush that was hard to match. Watching the innocent princess riding me in her control even as her beautiful breasts dangled as she rose and fall was a feast, and her struggle to catch her breath after the furious ride just added a delicious portion of dessert to the amazing meal. </p><p>Delicious enough to make me hungry enough for another bite, despite my assurances about the lesson’s end, especially as my erection came back to life with record speed, still inside her snug entrance. </p><p>“That was amazing,” I said to her even as I put my hand on her shoulder, caressing gently to make her open her eyes. “Now, are you ready for the second part of the lesson,” I said. </p><p>“T-the second part?” she stammered, her beautiful blue eyes widened in a way that might have melted the heart of a more merciful man, but just tempted me further. “But you said…” she tried to continue, only for her shyness to block her own voice under my gaze. She somehow felt shy talking about it even after displaying such a spectacular show. </p><p>“It’s because you’re such a good student, Aria,” I whispered throatily even as I grabbed her waist and pushed her up, helping her to stand up with her trembling feet. I also stood up, standing behind her. “Since you have managed to learn the previous lesson flawlessly, there’s no harm in giving the preview of the new topic. I expect a desire to excel from my students.” </p><p>As usual, my nonsensical arguments worked excellently when framed from a perspective of a tutor, triggering her submissiveness toward the authority, though, admittedly, the pleasure that was still held her body under control, making her tremble with every step as I led toward the middle of the cell. I was kind enough to cast a cleaning spell on the floor, even though it hadn’t been long enough for the floor to get dirty. Then, I summoned her dress directly in front of her. </p><p>“On your hands and knees,” I whispered to her even as I hugged her from behind, enjoying the smoothness of her skin. “It’s time we teach you some new positions. </p><p>“O-on my hands and knees,” she repeated, once again stammering as she tried to look at me, but failed to do so while wrapped in my arms. </p><p>The reason for her hesitancy was clear. There was something that was inherently dirtier in taking her while she was on all four in terms of power balance. Not a relatively balanced one like a student-teacher one either, but a wide gulf like between a servant and a lord. And due to her exalted position, even Aria, despite all her naivety, was aware of the implications. “Yes,” I said simply even as underlined it with a spank on her plump ass, making her flinch. “Is there a problem?” </p><p>Aria’s brief flare of rebellion died under my stiff spank. She didn’t dare to say anything, even when I let her go, and instead, obediently took the requested position on the floor, her dress gathered under her knees to prevent chafing. Interestingly, she positioned herself so that she not facing the door but the wall on the opposite side, leaving her blind to any possible visitor. I was curious whether it was intentional, or instinctual after the latest shameful display when Emma had barged inside. </p><p>My seed was already dripping down her entrance as I crouched down behind her, and for a moment, I was struck with the fancy of probing her remaining virgin hole, but decided otherwise. It was too early to do so, especially since we were ripe for interruptions here. It would have been a pity to go through all the necessary preparations to loosen her up, only to be interrupted before I could taste the fruit of my efforts. </p><p>So, rather than pushing the envelope more than necessary, I crouched behind her, my hands resting on her plump ass. “Are you ready?” I asked even as I slapped her ass, and she moaned, which carried shame and arousal in equal amounts. “Do we need to go over this again? When I ask a question, I expect a proper reply,” I said, spanking her again, this time hard enough to leave a red welt behind. </p><p>“S-sorry,” she stammered in shock, trying to adapt to the sudden change in attitude. But while she might be shocked by it, from the way she clenched, she was enjoying it despite her shock. </p><p>I let my gaze dance over her naked figure, her plump ass trembling in preparation, her firm tits dangling freely thanks to the position, while her blonde hair spilling down to hide her face. The last part wouldn’t do, I decided, and gathered her hair in my fist even as I pushed my shaft against her wet entrance, plunging the tip into her warm embrace. </p><p>“You’re enjoying this even more, don’t you?” I casually commented as I plunged deeper into her, enjoying her grasp, which was even tighter than the previous time. “You’re such a slutty princess.” </p><p>“W-what!” she cried loudly even as she tried to get used to my presence inside her. “N-no, t-that’s not it,” she added after a moan, but stammering so much that her lie wouldn’t have convinced an innocent kitten. </p><p>I spanked her ass again while pulling her hair simultaneously, extracting another pained cry that wasn’t bereft of pleasure. “Good girls don’t lie, Aria,” I said with a soft, lazy tone that contrasted greatly with my merciless pumping, the sound of our flesh melding threatening to break the walls of the cell. “Tell me, are you a good girl?” </p><p>Another spank later, her reply lashed out quickly. “I’m a good girl!” she cried, cracking as loud as the spank that just landed on her ass. </p><p>“Then, why are you being untruthful to my questions, sweetheart?” I whispered even as I pulled her hair hard, her back taking a deliciously curved shape to compensate. I cast another spell, this time creating a reflective surface on the wall that worked like a perfect mirror, forcing her to look at her own lewd expression. “Look at yourself, is this the face of a girl that doesn’t enjoy what’s happening to her.” </p><p>Her shock was apparent as she was finally forced to look at her expression in the mirror, contorted with pleasure. “N-no, sir,” she managed to murmur.</p><p>“Excellent,” I said, caressing her ass as a reward, which enhanced her pleasure further. “Now, tell me again, are you a slutty princess?” </p><p>It took a few seconds for her to answer, but she managed to utter her response without my pushing, even though she had to close her eyes, avoiding her own reflection. “Yes, sir. I’m a slutty princess,” she admitted, even though her own words made her tighten even more like she was trying to milk me. </p><p>“Keep your eyes open,” I ordered, and she did so, once again scandalized by the expression on her own reflection. “You’re such a good girl, getting tight and wet just for me,” I complimented her, once again shifting back to gentle caresses that contrasted with my furious pounding. She might be still too shy to admit it unprompted, but her body and her secretions were much more honest, shouting the feast of ecstasy she was experiencing. </p><p>Under all the factors that drove her arousal further, I wasn’t shocked when she climaxed barely a couple of minutes into our new position. Her arms trembled, threatening to topple her body, but I tightened my grip on her hair, both helping her to maintain her position, and keeping her alert with a jolt of pain. </p><p>“Please,” she gasped, asking for a moment’s rest, but I wasn’t willing to give that. </p><p>“You forgot something,” I reminded her. </p><p>“Please, sir,” she repeated, this time adding the required form of respect. I wasn’t intending to be a stickler on that, but if she was going to add that, I had no intention to let her get away with it. “I need to rest, just for a minute, please,” she begged. </p><p>“No,” I answered. “I don’t care how many times you cum, we’re not going to stop until I cum,” I added. </p><p>Her eyes widened, but that didn’t stop her moans of pleasure. However, a simple confident statement of mine was enough to destroy any past and future argument from her part, and she just took my impaling obediently, keeping her mouth shut. Or more accurately, trying to keep her mouth shut, as her body readily betrayed her, letting out an unending bevy of cries and moans, the occasional spank landing on her ass or hard pull of her hair only making them louder.</p><p>Seeing her obedience, I was tempted to push her even further, living up to my reputation as a Dark Lord. “You’re such a good princess, Aria,” I whispered mockingly. “Going all this trouble to better serve your amazing husband, Lancelot, even when he’s traversing out there with that slut, Isolde,” I mocked her, like what she had been doing wasn’t leagues worse than the suspicions about a possible dalliance. </p><p>“No, sir” she gasped, but despite her argument, being reminded of her own impending marriage only made her tighter. “I’m not a good princess,” she repeated. </p><p>“Of course not,” I said as I spanked her ass again. “Because you’re a slut princess. My slut princess until you marry.” Of course, I had no intention of letting her go even if I somehow fail to sabotage the wedding. Still, step by step. Despite our relationship, she was not at a point to admit it completely. </p><p>“Yes, sir,” she gasped, drunk with pleasure, and conquered by her endless climaxes. As I landed spank after spank to her ass, marring the perfection that was good enough to win a prize, before finally letting my hand trail down to her thighs, squeezing them in contrast. </p><p>“Say it fully, I want to hear you admit it,” I ordered. </p><p>“Yes, sir,” she repeated even as she steadily climbed toward another climax. “I’m your obedient slut princess, and I’ll do everything you want until my wedding day,” she gasped. </p><p>“Again,” I asked, punctuating my order with another hard spank, and she repeated the statement again… Then, again and again, claiming the role of my slut princess… I wished I had the proper tools to record that, as one day, I would have loved to show that to Queen, driving that just how weak her heir was. </p><p>She was climaxing for the third time, her moans of pleasure mixed with sobs of desperation as she was overwhelmed with pleasure, her eyes closed, when I felt a trigger on the wards, but the effort I put on them paid off. A brief surge of concentration told me that the visitor was Emma, which meant there was no problem with the visitor. </p><p>When the cell door opened, it was immediately accompanied by a gasp of shock, but it came from Emma. Aria didn’t even notice our intruder, too far gone in pleasure. “Welcome,” I said without even bothering to turn, just making eye contact with the red-haired mage through the mirror. </p><p>“W-what!” Emma stammered in shock, which was a justified reaction. After all, while the scene she had walked on the day before wasn’t exactly an innocent one, it definitely was compared to this. Seeing the heir to the throne moaning like a back-alley whore was no doubt shocking to her. </p><p>“Sit down,” I said to Emma, pointing at the only chair in the room. “We will talk after I’m finished with our innocent princess,” I said to Emma while Aria continued her moans, her eyes firmly shut as she tried to stay conscious through another climax. Her legs trembled, and her arms finally declared their surrender, but I shifted my hands to her waist to pull her upright, her back pressing against my chest, and her lips covered with mine. </p><p>“Say hi to our guest,” I whispered, making her open her mouth. </p><p>After my prompting, Aria finally noticed that the number of guests had increased. </p><p>“No,” she exclaimed and used her hands to cover her face, which did little to lessen the impact of the moment. However, the more important part was the way she tightened, clamped enough to finally make me cum. She moaned in shame as I filled her insides again, under the gaze of Emma, who was far too shocked to say anything, watching helplessly from her chair… </p>",

    "content": "<p>I skidded down the mountain, the hard ground crunching under my boots as I took another step. It was not just another step, but brought me out of the mountain’s border, and its oppressing chaotic magical field. I sucked air freely, a huge weight on my shoulder had disappeared. Even after living there for months, the oppression of the mountain was hard to get used to. </p><p>However, my sensation of freedom wasn’t just about the sudden lack of magical pressure —though it helped. The whole reason for my multi-year acting was to escape the clutches of my uncle to attain my freedom, as I could have attained security much easier, by playing another bootlicker to that pompous waste of space. </p><p>No, I wanted freedom, and being forcefully confined, even to such a huge area like Mount Pyrenaean, with all the adventure and danger it offered. Even with the pleasant company of Lillian and Astrid, it had been challenging. Without them, I would have gone crazy. </p><p>I sucked the air as I traveled down until the slope of the mountain disappeared into a smooth plain, decorated with trees. I wasn’t afraid of an ambush. Why would I, when I could feel everything around me with amazing clarity as soon as I expanded my magical senses without the murky feeling of the chaotic magical field? Still, only then, I realized just how lucky I was to fight a fellow Sorcerer in the mountain rather than the plains. Sorcerers were famous for their overwhelming power, but as I grew into my power, I realized just how frightening our senses were. </p><p>Without the mountain interfering with his senses, it was impossible to ambush them, at least not with an overwhelmingly strong spell like I had used… </p><p>As I traveled deeper into the forest, I let the past go. Whatever happened had happened, and whether through luck or planning, I was victorious, and gained precious experience from it. Add in my studies, and the weird changes my body continuing to go through, I wasn’t deathly afraid of a magical duel with another Sorcerer, even an experienced one… </p><p>It was a good feeling to travel while wearing a full set of clothes, I surmised as I enjoyed the sensation of the leather on my body. They looked simple with a glance, no different from the primitive leather clothing of any other tribal warrior, but not many tribal warriors had the privilege of wearing clothes made from the skin of Ethereal wolves, strong enough to resist spells and sword equally. I had a bag on my shoulder, equally unassuming, carrying only a bit of food and water, despite the precious magical materials that filled several hidden compartments it to the brim, protected by several runes. </p><p>On my back, there was also a spear, intimidating enough to scare a lone bandit, but not catchy enough to be remembered. Of course, the same wouldn’t be applied if someone had seen the great number of runes etched under the spearhead, turning it into a dangerous weapon of destruction for a limited time before the inferior materials burned under the flash of power, the best I could achieve without a dedicated smith to assist. </p><p>“Freedom,” I murmured as I leisurely walked in the forest, enjoying the gentle caress of the wind on my skin. For a while, I let everything go, the mysterious enemy I suddenly found myself facing against, exploring the circumstances of the mysterious death of my grandfather, scary changes my body was going through, even the overwhelming task of somehow infiltrating one of the most protected locations in the City of Rome, the heart of the Republic… </p><p>I let go of everything, enjoying the sensation of freedom… </p><p>Even more surprisingly, nothing of significance had happened for several days as I traveled leisurely, as I slowly traveled from the Western Gaul down to Cisalpine Gaul, a geographic area that included the intimidating Alpine mountain range that protected the mainland Italy from invaders for centuries, especially during winter, when they turned into impenetrable snow fortresses that repelled any invading army —with the notable exception of Hannibal, that gave the deadliest foreign challenge to Rome during its long existence, only to be denied by one of my ancestors. </p><p>Luckily, it was currently early spring, and the Alps weren’t fully dressed in their intimidating white armor. Unluckily, it seemed to be the end of my uneventful journey. </p><p>A cry rung clearly, begging for help, as a woman burst into the scene, wrapped in chains, and a shirt that carried a coat of arms, that clearly denoting her as a slave. Combined with the eight mounted men that were chasing her, it didn’t take a genius to decipher her identity. A slave. </p><p>It was an abominable concept that I hated, mostly due to my bastard birth that forced me to be more like a slave rather than a proper member of the household. When even the household guards had turned against me, the slaves were the only ones that I could talk with. Not that we created any deep bonds or anything, as the slaves that were smart enough to be employed in the noble houses were also smart enough to realize if they look too close to the bastard son of a family, it wouldn’t have ended nicely for them. My struggles had changed in nature after my grandfather had noticed my talent and started his merciless training, but the fact that for the first ten years of my life, the slaves were the only source of kindness in my life. </p><p>Pity that I wasn’t in a position to intervene. We were just a mile away from one of the busiest mountain passes in the Alpine Mountain Range, and we were surrounded by many merchants and travelers, not to mention a troop of soldiers just a couple of hundred yards away. Intervening in any kind of dispute between a slave and their owner was strictly forbidden, unless it was an extreme condition like an owner killing a slave for absolutely no reason. And even then, it was a very tricky thing to do unless done by a proper official. </p><p>Of course, fate didn’t allow me to take a breath, because lost in my thoughts, I hadn’t noticed that one of the slavers had noticed me, and shouted. “You as well, you escaped maggot,” he cried gleefully as he swung his whip. “Do you think you can avoid the attention of the Ulpius Trade Company?” </p><p>I raised my arm and let the whip wrap around my right forearm. Normally, the pain should have left me crying mindlessly, but after the transformation of my right forearm with the scales, neither pain nor injury didn’t affect that part. Not the ordinary kind, and even the magical attacks barely scratched it. Compared to that, a slaver’s whip didn’t even sting. </p><p>Still, it was a problem. Abducting people from the streets to enslave them was certainly illegal, but like all laws, the application usually depended on the location and the relative power of the aggressor and the victim. And as a lonely traveler away from home, dressed as a simple member of an insignificant tribe, I was the prime target for such violations. It wasn’t unheard of lonely travelers being abducted by slavers only to be sold in the slave market, with fake documents that ascertained a mountain of debt to create a legal fiction. </p><p>Retaliation, on the other hand, was the problem. I wanted nothing less than completely eviscerate those impudent slavers, and if they had dared to do so in a less crowded location, I would have loved to do so. But fighting against a group of eight was a feat to be remembered, whether done through the magic or might. If I do through magic, defeating eight men would be remembered, because there were very few mages that were capable of such a feat unless they belong to a noble family —either as a scion, or a sponsored adopted member— or a soldier. Combined with my age, it would put me into the spotlight. </p><p>Defeating them through sheer martial might was better, but only slightly. Still, it was better than nothing. I just hoped that they wouldn’t push too far after losing one or two members. </p><p>I made a show of crying in pain even as I pulled my attacker, using the convenient handle provided by the whip. Facing an unexpected display of force, my attacker flew in the air before finding himself skewered himself on my spear. I would have loved to stab him in the neck, ending his useless life, but doing so would have galvanized the rest, forcing them to take revenge. A serious, but not deadly, wound to the leg that avoided major veins was a perfect balance. </p><p>“Walk away, and nobody needs to be hurt,” I said calmly as I pressed the spear on the neck of my opponent as I looked at the slaver that was dressed richly. </p><p>It was a good plan, and for a moment, they seemed to be startled by the sudden change of pace. The eyes of the leader widened, realizing that their little game had a bigger cost than they had estimated. “Don’t you dare to hurt my man,” he called steadily, displaying his experience as he realized I didn’t have the slightest complication about killing him. </p><p>“Just walk away, no blood needs to be spilled this day,” I said calmly, then looked at the bleeding leg of my attacker. “Well, no more, at least,” I added with a mocking smirk, underlining my confidence. I had no problem killing my attacker if they forced me, and I made them aware of it. </p><p>Of course, it was that exact moment the Fate had decided I had been having a smooth-sailing journey, and decided to throw a wrench to my plans. The soldiers responsible for guarding the pass rode toward us quickly, and just as I prepared to explain my situation, their Decanus —the soldier responsible for leading a team of eight— spoke. “What’s happening, cousin?” he spoke. </p><p>I barely held my desire to curse, only possible through endless days of annoyance I had struggled while I was in Halls of Saturn, or back in my family estate. “Nothing much, just a disobedient slave,” said the leader of the slavers, not even bothering to hide his wink. Why would he, after all, everyone was aware of what was going on, but no one would have risked their lives against both soldiers and sanctioned slave traders just for a random passerby. </p><p>“Drop your weapon,” Decanus ordered, and I sighed even as I dropped my spear, despite the temptation to kill all of them together. Unfortunately, if the killing slavers were like igniting a bonfire, killing a team of soldiers under bright daylight was like setting a building on fire. The exact opposite of what I should do just as I was about to step into the most important province of the Roman Republic.  </p><p>“I surrender,” I murmured, doing my best to hide my lazy exhaustion as I dropped the spear, preparing myself for the inevitable blow. The only mystery was whether the soldiers of the slavers would act first. </p><p>The small mystery was resolved when I felt a movement behind, and one of the soldiers hit my temple with the hilt of his sword. Idiot, I thought even as I throw myself on the ground, acting dazed. It barely hurt me due to my supernatural strength, but such a blow could have easily killed a lesser man, which would have been pointless considering the aim of the slavers. </p><p>The leader of slavers looked annoyed, no doubt thinking the same thing, but despite my hopes, he proved smart enough to keep her mouth shut. “Thank you, cousin,” he said instead, and passed a small pouch to him, no doubt filled with a generous amount of cash. I laid there motionless as someone tied my hands behind my back, kicking my ribs a couple of times in the process. I did nothing but look at my offender’s face, memorizing it for payback. </p><p>While one of them forced me up, the other checked my bag, and hummed in dissatisfaction. “Nothing but food and spare clothing,” he murmured dissatisfaction, and threw it on his shoulder after showing it to the leader, while another one picked my spear, making me sigh in relaxation. It was good that they had taken them, as chasing them would have been really annoying. </p><p>We stayed in the same location for five minutes, while the leader —named Lydus— talked to his cousin, our small group moved, eight mounted men forcing us slaves on foot with a brisk pace. </p><p>Only then, I looked at the escaped slave, who was crying endlessly, despite her lack of a wound, which was interesting, as a slave trying to escape usually received at least a few lashes, maybe even more. Even more interesting was a distinct lack of tattoo on her, unlike most slaves who were branded with a slave mark, usually directly on the forehead to prevent it from being hidden. </p><p>Combined, it was clear that she was captured to be made a pleasure slave. The lack of a mark, combined with the relatively gentle treatment even after an attempt to escape made it obvious that she was about to be groomed as a pleasure slave. </p><p>“I am sorry,” she whispered with a trembling voice. “It’s all my fault. If I hadn’t tried to escape…” </p><p>“Don’t worry about it,” I whispered back. “It’s only natural for you to try to escape, I can hardly blame their greed to you,” I said, but before I could continue, the slaver I had wounded shouted us to be silent, punctuating his sentence by another hit from his whip, this time directly on my chest. Unlike my forearm, my chest wasn’t completely immune to damage, but the protection of my leather clothes, combined with my supernaturally strong body, blunted most of the impact. </p><p>I still made a show of crying in pain, which made the slave girl cry even louder. I sighed, pitying her.</p><p> Of course, I doubted I could have been magnanimous enough to pity her for her emotional distress if my capture was anything but a temporary change of arrangement. Imprisoning even an ordinary mage was a risky affair, one that required intense preparation and could still backfire.</p><p>Imprisoning a Sorcerer without even being aware of his magical gifts, however, was nothing less than a total disaster. </p><p>It was going to be fun… </p>",

    "content": "<p>As we climbed the stairs, I half-expected her to change her mind at the last moment. After all, it was a bit different than pawing each other in the confines of a car parked in the middle of nowhere, dragged by the heat of the moment. It was even different than what was happening in the back garden earlier, where I was leveraging her intense arousal to tease her a bit, partly for enjoyment, partly to teach her just how the inability to say no could push the situation more than she could handle. </p><p>I was still her tutor, after all, and I took my job seriously. </p><p>Just to underline that, I turned to her just before we stepped into the shower. Her blue eyes widened as she was suddenly caught under my serious gaze, but she didn’t take a step back, maintaining our closeness, which was always nice. “You know that you can say no whenever you want, right?” I reminded her. “You don’t have to follow it just because I want to.” </p><p>She looked at my face seriously after my words —though I noticed her eyes occasionally dipping to my naked chest, still glistening with sweat— processing my statement. “Thanks,” she finally murmured. “But I want to do this.” </p><p>“As you wish,” I said even as I took a hold of her hand and dragged her to the bathroom. “Last warning, don’t forget that you can ask me to slow down or stop anytime,” I reminded her. </p><p>“I know-” she started, only for me to silence her with a kiss the moment we passed through the doorway. My arm wrapped around her naked waist, her tits covered with her sports bra smashing against my naked chest. Unlike the previous kiss we shared in the car, my tongue assaulted her mouth from the beginning, ravaging her tongue as she tried to conduct defensive warfare. From her moans, she seemed to enjoy that. </p><p>Distracted by the kiss, she barely noticed my fingers slipping down, pushing her loose sweatpants down. She took notice as she stepped out of them, nor did she pay attention as I shed my own underwear, leaving myself naked. She even kicked her socks and shoes absentmindedly, revealing her dainty feet. </p><p>When I pulled back from the kiss, we were already in the shower —which, thankfully, was large enough to comfortably host two of us— and the hot water started to flow, her underwear completely drenched, turning semi-transparent. Though, after observing their beautiful glory the last night, I had no intention of letting them stay hidden, even behind such an insufficient cover, so I pulled them off quickly enough to classify them as ripping them off. </p><p>The last night, I had seen her breasts in the car, in a heated environment, where environment light was significantly lacking. Hence, I had some doubts about my recollection. Maybe her breasts weren’t as spectacularly flawless as I remembered, their flaws hidden by the dimness of the interior lights. Or maybe, due to my own horniness and lack of climax, I built them up in my mind exaggeratedly. </p><p>It turned out to be the exact opposite, I realized, as I examined her perfection under a light bright enough to catch every little detail, impressed by a lack of flaws. Perfect skin, perfect curves, and impervious to gravity. The glistening drops of water flowing constantly shone whenever she trembled, making the scene even more delicious. </p><p> Carrie tried to cover her breasts for a moment, but her arms soon dropped back under my amused grin. “Turn your back,” I ordered, and then gently pushed her against the cold walls of the shower, earning a gasp. “Let me help you,” I suggested even as I took a generous amount of shampoo, and started massaging her hair. It might have been a sensual, almost romantic moment, but my shaft pressing against her ass, separated only by the barely-existent coverage of her soaking-wet panties, made the moment much more erotic, her breathing quickening with each passing second. </p><p>Seeing the effect my touch was having on her, I decided to have mercy, and rather than slowly teasing her, I let the shampoo rinse off her beautiful blonde hair before switching to shower gel, and let my hands caress her neck and shoulders, a mixture of gentle caresses and proper massage. If her whimper was any indicator, it was working excellently. </p><p>Honestly, my throbbing shaft was begging me to cut my amusing play short by ripping off her panties and plunging deep, to teach her the real meaning of pleasure. However, her delicious whimpers as I moved to her back, my fingertips occasionally caressing her breasts, managed to convince me otherwise. Carrie was a delicious dinner, and it would be a waste to eat the dessert before the starter and the main course… </p><p>“Ah,” she gasped as I moved onto her lower back, but didn’t waste much time there before moving to her delicious thighs, bypassing her ass no matter how inviting it looked. I had a feeling that, if I pulled down her panties, my resolution to take things slow wouldn’t have survived. Bypassing the area, I was able to finish massaging her thighs and calves without an issue, though her occasional moans hadn’t made resisting any easier. </p><p>After finishing, I stood up, pressing my body against hers, while whispering, “It’s time to handle the other side.” </p><p>“I can’t,” she whispered back. “Not with your body pressing against mine.” </p><p>“My bad,” I said, my chuckle echoing off the ceramic walls of the shower as I pulled back slightly, giving her just enough space to turn, our eyes meeting again, though she failed to maintain the connection as her eyes dipped down, her eyes widening as she saw my shaft at full erection once more, no doubt experiencing a similar shock of what I had experienced while examining her breasts, trying to reconcile her memories and the reality. </p><p>This time, I didn’t waste time slowly teasing her shoulders or arms. Instead, I brought my soapy hands on her breasts, caressing gently as I covered them with bubbles. Surprisingly, rather than staying passive, her hands joined the fray, and after squirting some shower gel to her hand with an adorable slowness, she started soaping my chest as well, though, just like me, she was more interested in learning the intricacies of my body. </p><p>As our mutual assistance in cleaning extended, I didn’t know who leaned in first, but soon, we were sharing a long kiss, one that might have been classified as gentle and tender if it wasn’t for our hands, rubbing each other’s bare skin. And as arousal built up, the kiss soon lost its tender nature, turning into a furious dance… </p><p>I was considering whether to push forward or take it slow, when Carrie surprised me by grabbing my wrist. At first, I was afraid of her stopping me from playing with her gloriously perfect tits, but then, she pushed my arm down while making sure my fingers didn’t lose connection with her skin. After passing her trembling belly, we arrived at the edge of her panties…</p><p>Or more accurately, where the edge of her panties would have been if she hadn’t already somehow managed to kick them off without alerting me during our intimate shower. Instead, my fingers delved deeper toward her soft core, enjoying her smoothness. “Someone came prepared,” I whispered when I pulled away from the kiss, which somehow managed to make her blush despite the situation. </p><p>And it made her only sexier. </p><p>Her way of dealing with the embarrassment was even more surprising. She grabbed my shoulders and pulled me to her so that our bodies pressed together, barely giving me enough space to wiggle my fingers. Luckily, with her orgasm already knocking on the door, asking for an invitation thanks to our extended foreplay, I didn’t need more than a short yet intense wiggling of my fingers, circling her knob repeatedly before delivering the ultimate flick. </p><p>She started shivering as she climaxed, locked between my muscular body and the cold wall. Which, admittedly, wasn’t my smartest idea, because pushing against the naked body of a voluptuous blonde while she climaxed after an intense massage was rather tempting, my cock throbbing with anticipation. If she had been one of the loose cheerleaders I made a habit of hanging at my last school, I would have been already balls-deep, furiously pumping as I sought release. But Carrie was too vulnerable to handle such a direct shift, so I needed to hold myself back. </p><p>No matter how tempting the idea was.  </p><p>“Can you stand on your own?” I asked as her trembling finally ceased. </p><p>“Yes,” she answered, her eyes firmly shut, and I let her go. When she fell on her knees immediately, I was afraid that she had underestimated herself, only for her blue eyes to suddenly open, and lock into mine, burning with a purpose that cut through the haze of pleasure. And when her hand wrapped around the base of my cock and her lips parted, she left no doubt about what she was planning next. </p><p>I was more than happy to allow her. I wasn’t going to push her, but it was very different if she was willingly offering. I stood still when her lips touched the crown of my shaft, no matter how tempted I was to push my hips forward and invade her mouth mercilessly. Instead, I let her close her eyes and focus on the task at hand. </p><p>Then, as her head moved rhythmically, she proved that she was yet to run out of surprises. This time, it was the great pacing she was showing as she devoured half of my shaft immediately before pulling back, teasing my already-throbbing cock with an alternating rhythm, showing me a great ability. </p><p>If I hadn’t seen her lack of experience the previous night, I would have never believed it was the first time she was doing that. But with her personality, there was another possibility, one that was both amusing and entertaining at the same time, and the occasional hesitant glance she sent toward my way, checking the effect of her beautiful lips, confirmed my assumption. </p><p>“So,” I murmured lazily. “How many hours you have researched and studied for this the last night?” I asked, unable to keep myself teasing her. </p><p>Once again, her blush was almost as spectacular as the beauty of her naked body, the rest of her skin almost rivaling the rosy tone of her areolas. She pulled back for a moment, and whispered. “Four and a half hours,” she murmured shyly as she looked down, like she was about to escape. </p><p>“You’re really an amazing student to tutor,” I said with a chuckle, grabbing her head to pull her head closer just a bit, signaling that she should continue. “You’re amazing, continue as you wish.” I had no intention to skip such a delicious first-time blowjob from my sexy nerd for a simple teasing. Luckily, Carrie seemed to be even more enthusiastic for the task, and her lips wrapped around my shaft once more. This time, her grip was even tighter, my earlier words clearly giving her the courage to push her limits more. </p><p>Her tongue joined the fray, flicking back and forth over my length, sometimes teasing the base, sometimes tickling the tip, alternating the sensations. The sense of pleasure jumped even higher as she moaned in pleasure, the rumblings giving a nice massage that pushed me even closer to the edge, the tingling starting from the crown and reaching to the base of my cock, testing the limits of my conviction of not pushing my hips forward, allowing her to set up the pace. </p><p>Then, she either managed to read my dilemma, or the gods had nothing better to do and decided to answer my prayers, because, in a surprising move, she tightly grabbed my thighs, using the leverage to suddenly sank herself deeper. She started gagging as she forced my cock deeper into her throat, making me experience arguably the greatest sensation of my life, just as I was already pushing the edge. With each passing second, the waves of orgasmic heat started to get stronger, threatening explosion. </p><p>“I’m about to cum,” I warned her barely a minute after she launched her last secret ability. She pulled out immediately, but proved that she was not out of surprises, because she aimed my cock at her breasts, my fascination with their perfection hardly a surprise at this point. </p><p>I sprayed her chest with my seed like a relentless hose, covering her tits with enough of my seed to make me glad we were already in the shower. With her blue eyes shining and her wet blonde hair stuck over her body, it might not be the most hardcore scene I had ever experienced, but without a doubt, it was the most erotic scene I had ever experienced… </p><p>I couldn’t wait until her next surprise… </p><p><br></p>",

    "content": "<p>Oeyne’s whisper was all the permission I needed to launch myself off my chair with a mighty push and grab her without slowing down, until she was sitting on her desk, her plump ass squishing the papers she had been working on all night. She didn’t look perfectly happy with the way I manhandled them, but the merciless assault of my tongue gave her something better to focus on. Our lips did the familiar dance, her moans providing the accompanying music.</p><p>“Hey,” she gasped, when we pulled away for a breather. “I need those papers.” </p><p>“Are you sure?” I said, a mocking grin on my face as I grabbed one of the latest papers. “Because from what I had seen as you worked on them, you clearly have no idea what you are doing. The supporting enhancement structure is completely wrong, the magical containment field would self-destruct in three hits no matter how much adjustment you can squeeze through, and even with my limited smithing knowledge, I could see that the alloy for the repairs is completely wrong.” </p><p>“I know,” she frowned. “It’s just an initial draft. I’ll find the best way to work on it sooner or later.” </p><p>Rather than answering, I pressed my lips against hers for another extended kiss, and happy to notice her aggressiveness bouncing up another notch. Deliciously torturing her the last time with all that edge play had been fun, but ultimately, Oeyne was a bundle of excess energy, and I liked her to be more active. As she tried to defend her territory,  my fingers started to wander aggressively, digging into her supple flesh. </p><p>This time, the kiss lasted much longer than the earlier peck, and she was panting and gasping once I pulled back. She said nothing, but trying to look calm, but her frazzled hair and her parted legs were sufficient as the answer about just how much she was being affected by the kiss. Wordlessly, she begged for more. </p><p>I just chuckled in response. “Maybe we should work on it together from the design?” I offered even as I grabbed her nipple, twisting lazily like it was a desk toy to be played with whenever I was bored. She gasped in shock. “No disrespect to you in the field of smithing, but your accomplishment in magic is significantly below mine. And you need me in any case since the princess lacks a competent mage versed in those aspects.” </p><p>“Maybe she does, maybe she doesn’t,” Oeyne tried to answer obscurely, trying to hide the princess’ secrets, but it was too little too late. </p><p>Just to amuse myself, I gathered some cold-natured mana on my fingertip before I dragged it around her nipple, her thin top failing completely to cut the sensation. She gasped in shock while her nipples got even harder, pushing against the fabric of her flimsy shirt, begging to be cut free. And since I was such a nice guy, I ripped her shirt, freeing her tits from the tyranny of their coverage. </p><p>Only then, I answered her attempt to deflect. “Nice try, honey,” I said. “But if she had anyone to help her with that, you wouldn’t ask my help to help you forge.” </p><p>She failed to answer, blushing at her own slip. I was mostly sure, but her latest reaction confirmed that. Oeyne was really not fit for any kind of political intrigue. Living alone in Silver Spires, away from politics was the right choice for her. Still, while she searched for an answer to recover her situation —an answer that didn’t exist— I focused on her breasts, trailing her naked caramel skin… </p><p>She failed to come up with an answer, even when I stayed away from her lips. That didn’t mean I was depriving her of my kiss, of course, not when my lips landed on her cheek before trailing down to her jawline. I stayed there for a while, every kiss bringing me a tiny bit lower, and making her shiver a tiny bit more… When I finished my journey on her jawline and switched to her neck, trailing down much more aggressively, she was yet to find an answer. </p><p>“So, do you want my help in the design process?” I whispered as I nibbled her collarbones, while my hand sneaked to her back and dragging down her spine, making her purr. </p><p>“Maybe,” she murmured, before sighing in defeat. “I do need help. Even from the limited information they were able to send in advance, it’s obvious that the spear is well above anything I had ever seen. I don’t know I could even repair it without destroying it.” </p><p>“Don’t worry, we’ll handle it,” I whispered even as I separated my lips from her skin for a moment. “Why don’t you explain to me the details while I help you relax,” I whispered as I slipped even lower, and took her nipple in my mouth, caressing gently. She tasted sweet, with just a hint of smoke, reminding me of the best whiskeys. </p><p>“It’s made from an unknown alloy, supported by a wide number of magical arrays,” Oeyne started, launching an explanation that lasted almost ten minutes, telling me everything that they were able to decipher based on the spear, though toward the end, her explanation became hard to trace. No wonder she was having trouble developing a preliminary method, half of the magical information she presented contradicted the other half. The problem, we didn’t know whether it was the spear that was truly extraordinary to the point of breaking my understanding of magical theories, or princess’ assistants had screwed their diagnostic spells. </p><p>I hoped it was the first, which would allow me to push my abilities forward, but reasonably, I expected it to be the second. </p><p>Since I had decided that the preliminary work was of limited usefulness, I decided to use my time better, and increased the intensity of Oeyne’s treatment. Moans started to interrupt her explanation rapidly, until her moans overtook the explanation itself. “Please,” she gasped. “It’s hard enough to remember everything already.” </p><p>“No worries,” I consoled her, even as I let my hands finally move down her belly and landing on the waistband of her shorts. “There are too many contradictions on the spell structure, to a point that it’s impossible to solve the problem remotely. We just need to focus on processing the required materials, and some excess, as preparation. Others, we can focus on after the princess arrives with the spear. She just needs to stay as a guest for a few days while we decipher firsthand,” I explained.</p><p>“Makes sense—” she managed to murmur before my hand slipped through the waistband of her shorts, circling around her knob, then her mouth was occupied by her moans. She leaned back, her hands landing on her desk, not caring about damaging the papers she had been working on all night anymore. </p><p>“So, tell me about the alloy structure, and how are you planning to repair such a dangerously magical weapon from a smithing perspective,” I whispered. </p><p>“R-really,” she managed to stammer between her moans. “Right now?” </p><p>“It’s not like you’re doing anything,” I countered, my smirk wide enough to twist her face into annoyance, but it didn’t last long, once again replaced by ecstasy. A measured flick to her clit while coating my finger with ice-mana saw to that. </p><p>“You’re evil,” she gasped, but still, her explanation started. “The root of the problem is creating the correct alloy structure…” she started, her moans slower than necessary.  </p><p>[+1 Craft]</p><p>Happy with the quick skill gain, I slowed down my teasing, mostly to keep her coherent enough to continue her explanation, while distracted enough to occasionally slip one of her precious personal smithing secrets. For some of them, I was knowledgeable enough to understand their significance, though I had no doubt that for every single secret I understood, I was missing ten of them. Luckily, with my Intelligence stat, I was able to memorize her words verbatim even as I enjoyed her juices flowing around my fingers, preparing for future success without sacrificing the present pleasure. </p><p>Multitasking had never been this fun. </p><p>There was a unique sense of pleasure derived from the sensation of control, watching her gasp and moan as my fingers slowly slipped inside her, teasing her most sensitive spot, but never enough to topple her to the other side. Her struggle to hide the impact of my moves made it even more delicious. Then, she reached the end of her explanation. </p><p>[+4 Craft]</p><p>At this point, I could have used follow-up questions to ferret out even more of her secrets, but ultimately, I decided that she had earned her reward through her obedience, and decided to deliver the implied promise. I kept my right where it was, with fingers buried in her snatch, while my left hand landed on the great expanse of her breasts, once again gorging itself with the delicious firmness of her breasts. </p><p>It was all that needed to push Oeyne into the territory where everything but the pleasure lost its significance. As my fingers disappeared in the great expanse of her caramel breasts, she moaned in pure ecstasy, forcing me to snatch her lips in another kiss just to protect my eardrums —not that kissing her plump lips as she writhed in pleasure was by any means a great chore. </p><p>“It feels amazing. Do it harder! I’ll whatever you want,” she gasped when I pulled away from her lips, signaling my victory, not that it was in doubt. And as an honorable warrior, it was my duty to respect such a heartfelt surrender. I squeezed her tits even harder even returned my lips over hers, my tongue ravaging her mouth mercilessly. Most importantly, the dance of my fingers quickened, from a soft caress to a merciless assault. </p><p>From there, it took a bare few moments for her to stiffen for a moment, before trembling invaded her body, losing any coherence of control, relieved to finally arrive at her destination with an explosive climax. She collapsed on me as she trembled, putting her head on my shoulder to maintain her balance. </p><p>Of course, it was just a start, and I still had one important thing to attend, one that was making my pants very uncomfortable. Bringing her to her bed was an option, but I decided to take a bigger step, one that would symbolically clench the new balance of authority between us. I lifted her up in a bridal hold, and walked toward the forge, where a cold stone surface lay in the middle of her tools and equipment, where she created the weapons and tools that she was so proud of. </p><p>I carried her toward the forge, and pushed her down on the smooth surface near bellows, empty of the clutter of her ongoing work. It was inches away from the area where she usually forged, which would have been extremely dangerous for anyone that didn’t share our overwhelming physical stats. </p><p>She tried to speak, only for her breath to explode as her chest hit the smooth surface. Another gasp followed when I cast the spell to clean up and prepare her backdoor entrance, ready for my visitation. </p><p>Her shocked tone was rather glorious as I pressed my shaft against her puckered hole, pushing forward quick enough to make her feel a sting of pain, but not quick enough to actually hurt. “W-what are you doing!” she exclaimed even as the crown disappeared in her spectacularly tight grip. </p><p>“I’m looking for something to distract me while I forged, of course,” I said lazily, even as I quickly cast a couple of telekinetic spells, pulling one of the pure silver ingots she had in storage. It floated along with her hammer. </p><p>“You -” she started, only to be interrupted by a gasp. </p><p>“I, what?” I said mockingly as I slapped her plump ass, enjoying its jiggle. </p><p>“You can’t be serious!” she exploded, however, she continued to lay obediently on the stone surface while I plunged the silver ingot in the ever-glowing embers of her forge, then turned my attention back to Oeyne. </p><p>“Oh, but I am,” I said lazily even as I alternated between squeezing and slapping her ass, enjoying her distraction that followed an orgasm. “Why, is there a problem?” I asked, but at the same time, slipped two fingers in her wet snatch, making her moan in lieu of answering. “I thought so,” I said mockingly, as I slowly pushed deeper. </p><p>“That’s -” she gasped, trying to contain her voice as she struggled under the multiple sources of pleasure. “That’s unnatural,” she barely managed to say. </p><p>“Really,” I said domineeringly as I pushed my shaft deeper into her tight hole, enjoying her grip as I kept going deeper and deeper past her ring, forcing her to widen more and more. She was getting more and more ready for the ultimate penetration her spectacular ass had deserved. </p><p>It took a minute for her useless arguments to fade away, and another minute for her to reach back and spread open her ass cheeks to make my invasion even easier, signaling her changing opinions about anal sex. Her moans rose, deep and low, as she raised her ass, presenting an even better angle for me to penetrate deeper. I followed her invitation, enjoying her tightly constricting grip even further, finally treating every inch of my shaft as I finally pushed my full size. </p><p>A different girl would have been crying in pain, but Oeyne just moaned in pleasure, not surprising me with her pain resistance. Even with all the supernatural protections stats afforded, smithing was a painful business. Since she was moaning enthusiastically, I didn’t bother to warn her before pulling back, only to slam back in, this time harder, testing her tightness further even as her ass jiggled under the unusual blow. </p><p>Then, just before I started really enjoying her tight hole, I noticed the silver ingot glowing in a nice pink shade, signaling that it was finally time to start as well. </p><p>The timing was as perfect as it could get. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 30    Experience: 441500 / 465000 </p><p>Strength: 36    Charisma: 51</p><p>Precision: 33    Perception: 35</p><p>Agility: 33     Manipulation: 38</p><p>Speed: 32       Intelligence: 42</p><p>Endurance: 30      Wisdom: 44</p><p>HP: 4920 / 4920 Mana: 6300 / 6300        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Master Subterfuge [97/100]         </p><p>Master Arcana [91/100]        </p><p>Expert Speech [68/75]</p><p>Advanced Craft [45/50]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 17/25] </p><p>[Helga - Level 13/17] </p>",

    "content": "<p>When I left the headmistress’s office, it was still the nighttime, with at least two hours until dawn. So, I expected Oeyne to sleep. If it wasn’t for the impending visit of the mysterious oldest princess of the Empire, I might have refrained from waking her up, but that discussion already forced me to reveal some of my cards. </p><p>Compared to that, breaking her wards to visit her without permission was not a big deal. </p><p>The doors of the Hall of Craft was closed to the visitor during the night, but since they had many apprentices and servants bustling around to clean and to replenish their material stocks, I managed to sneak in without even skipping a step, as easy as I was entering my own room. Though, with my current abilities and the latest boost I received, breaking into Oeyne’s room only took a moment’s concentration, a complicated flaring of my mana enough to unravel her whole protection scheme. </p><p>[+1 Arcana]</p><p>[-16 Mana]</p><p>I was expecting to find a silent room, maybe with a soft snore if Oeyne had indulged in too much alcohol. Instead, I found her on the desk next to her forge, a huge pile of papers in front of her, with another pile of bottles next to her that rivaled the papers on the side. My eyes widened as I measured the size of the pile. No wonder she was feeling hungover in the mornings even with her supernatural endurance, if that was her casual consumption. She wasn’t drunk, as she was still clear-minded enough to work on her complicated smithing schemes —though double-checking them after sobering was likely a good idea. </p><p>I walked without bothering to hide, but she was far too focused on her task to notice me, even when I stood behind her and read her work over her shoulder. </p><p>[+2 Craft]</p><p>The notification surprised me quite a bit, so I decided to make a small game out of waiting, curious how long it would take for her to notice me. However, after a couple of minutes passed, I had to admit that it was very unlikely for her to notice me, at least not until she noticed my presence. However, the bigger disappointment came when I looked down at her cleavage to enjoy the other benefit of my position. </p><p>[Level Difference of five or more! No Experience]</p><p>I sighed disappointedly as I noticed that particular detail, as realized I had overgrown yet another source of experience. Yes, there was still the experience I could gain from the companion process, but I wasn’t willing to progress that with Oeyne yet, not until I could get a better handle of her relationship with the princess, and the possible implications of her visit. I had already pushed my luck too far by my trick with Titania, but at least, the headmistress needed me, enough to come up with an offer of empowerment —both to increase my value and to control me, but there was a general understanding between us. </p><p>At least, I hoped that was the case… </p><p>With the princess, things were a bit different. I didn’t know anything other than a few nuggets I had managed to extract from Oeyne and Titania, and neither was the embodiment of political awareness. Moreover, from what I understood, the princess’ position was weak enough to actually use my existence as a bargaining chip against her rivals —I still didn’t know how rare was my abilities to give extra powers or assess them directly. The headmistress also had them in some fashion, which meant they weren’t completely unique, but the headmistress was one of the most mysterious characters in the Empire, therefore not the best benchmark about the rarity of an ability. </p><p>Luckily, I had many ways of enjoying our time without triggering the process of the Companion Process further, and the simplest one was enjoying the look of her spectacular body. </p><p>Her caramel skin looked even better under the murky shadows of the room, illuminated by a solitary crystal on her desk and the ever-glowing coals of her forge, adding a flickering pink tint to her light brown skin, which made her look even more luscious. And considering how she looked like sex incarnate without paying the slightest attention to her clothing and posture thanks to her bountiful curves and perfect body, it was a considerable achievement. </p><p>Her current clothing also enhanced her sexiness quite a bit. As usual, she wasn’t exactly dressed to impress, rather, just wearing the stuff she wore when she slept in her lonesome. Thanks to her curves, however, a shirt old enough to lose most of its color, with several small burn marks littering revealing the glimpses of her more intimate parts of her body including her lack of a bra, worked like a wondrous piece of clothing rather than garbage only fit to be used as a rag. </p><p>The shorts that were responsible for covering her bountiful ass was in a better condition, but that didn’t affect her sexiness, especially since her shorts were both tiny enough to reveal her toned legs, and clingy enough to reveal the curves of her ass. The soft material looked comfortable, but without detracting it from her sexiness. So, splitting my attention between the schematics she was working on, and her body, wasn’t exactly a chore, even without the benefit of some extra experience. </p><p>[+7 Craft]</p><p>Still, I decided to act when the skill acquisition started to slow down, because the blueprints she was scribbling were too complicated to understand, especially since I didn’t know their ultimate aim. Still, from the details of the magical aspects, which I was very well-versed in, I could see many errors, some of which she managed to fix with each iteration, but only through making even more major changes. </p><p>If the smithing portions of the calculations were as riddled with the mistakes, no wonder I couldn’t understand what she was trying to do… </p><p>“How about if you link the secondary structures together directly-” I started, a smirk on my face, only for her to swing her arm in panic. Understandable, considering I had startled her completely. </p><p>Her punch flew threateningly, cutting through the air at a scary velocity even when she was unprepared. Her strength was not a joke. I had no doubt that if I let her hit a wall with minimal magical reinforcements, she would punch through, even when she was unprepared and poorly balanced. </p><p>Too bad that I had enough strength to catch the said threatening punch without flinching. Her expression of shock was beautiful, flaring at first because I caught her punch, only to burn even thicker when she realized my identity. “How have you been since we last met, Oeyne?” I said with a smirk, like the situation we were under was by any means normal. </p><p>“W-what are you doing here?” she whispered, shocked. </p><p>“Huh,” I said lazily even as I let her hand go before pulling a chair for myself. “And here I am, expecting you to be curious about how I entered without alerting you.” It was a trick I had leveraged several times to disrupt my opponents, the more casual I looked under dangerous circumstances, the more they panicked. And for the purposes of the conversation that was about to happen, Oeyne was definitely my opponent. </p><p>“How-” she stammered, only to cut short, her body alert. “What do you want?” she asked, alarmed. </p><p>“We need to talk about the upcoming visit of the princess,” I said. </p><p>“I know I shouldn’t have told you that,” Oeyne looked at me, alarmed, her fingers twitching. She wasn’t as bad as Aviada, but she was a straightforward person, so wanted to solve the problem directly. Still, she was reluctant, which was the whole point of the trick with the punch, telling her that I was more than I had revealed during our earlier talks. “Who are you?” </p><p>“For the purposes of the discussion, you can think of me as a patriotic citizen concerned with saving the life of a royal,” I said. </p><p>“Are you threatening-” she started, only to be cut short by a silencing spell. </p><p>[-5 Mana]</p><p>“Don’t talk nonsense,” I said lazily. “If I had any intention of harming her, I wouldn’t be here, talking to you,” I said. </p><p>The spell I used was rather simple, so it didn’t take much for her to break it. “Then, why are you here?” </p><p>“We need to make sure to arrange her security. First of all, is there a chance for her to still change her mind and cancel her visit? It’s really dangerous for her to be here.” </p><p>[+2 Speech]</p><p>Oeyne looked conflicted, but her drinking habits worked to my benefit, making her less cautious. Combined with her adrenaline rush, and the confusing pattern of discussion I had applied, she lost control of the talk. </p><p>“Not a chance,” she murmured. “She is already in a shaky position, and she barely arranged this visit. It’s impossible to cancel. One of her subordinates had discovered an old artifact that has the potential to rival some of the best weapons in the private armory of the Emperor, but only if it’s properly repaired. And she can’t trust anyone in the Capital, as if discovered, one of his brothers could stake their claim on the sword instead, leveraging their relative power. Royal politics are more complicated than I can understand.” </p><p>“I see,” I murmured. “So, we’re talking about a really important weapon. What’s that, a sword?” </p><p>“No, a spear,” Oeyne corrected. </p><p>“Still, is it really this important. There’s a high chance that she would die if she visits. The life of a princess should be more valuable than a spear. Is there really no way to cancel the trip.” </p><p>Oeyne stopped for a long breath. “Probably not. The task here is too important to delay, and her position is too shaky to hope for a reprieve.” She stopped for a moment for another breath. “But with her guards, she has the power to detect and avoid any ambush too big for her to defend against, and she should be secure once she steps into Silver Spires. No one would dare to attack a royal under the protection of the headmistress,” Oeyne explained, only to freeze when she saw my expression. “Right?” she continued, but her voice was much more vulnerable, asking for confirmation. </p><p>“Not if the headmistress is busy defending against several monster hordes and a huge undead army at the same time, while possible traitors launching an attack from inside the wards.” </p><p>“Impossible,” Oeyne murmured, but still, she obediently listened as I gave a breakdown of the major points, without revealing anything concrete like the location of the undead base or such, instead of leaning heavily onto the headmistress’ and Titania’s reputation, prompting Oeyne to ask them if she wants confirmation. </p><p>It took quite a while for her to process that, then she went in a different direction. “So, you’re a member of the headmistress’ inner circle, then,” Oeyne said. “A secret knife to the librarian’s sledgehammer of light.” </p><p>It was a good assumption, and for a moment, I was tempted to accept that, as it would make my job easier in the short term. Considering the limits of the circumstances, accepting that would be certainly convincing for the princess. On the other hand, it would completely cut any chance of making inroads to the princess without the involvement of the headmistress, as the princess would rightfully assume that the real decision-maker was the headmistress. </p><p>No, I decided. Staking my independence was the better option. “Not exactly,” I answered Oeyne. “I don’t belong to any power block in Silver Spire, or even in the Empire. We’re more like a group of loosely aligned allies, supporting each other in our missions, and the headmistress is a remote, but welcome ally. I’m actually in Silver Spires for a completely different reason.” </p><p>“Is this about the princess?” she asked. </p><p>“Sure,” I said. “If I could project the princess visiting two years in advance, of course.” She chuckled at my response. It wasn’t the best joke, hell, it was barely a joke, but the moment was tense enough that even the barest joke was a relief. “No, I’m here to do some research into the past, some other aims. I come to find you because I genuinely need better gear, and you’re the best unaffiliated blacksmith,” I said, then grumbled playfully. “Or at least, you were supposed to be, this royal visit complicates things a bit. Maybe I should properly punish you for that,” I added suggestively.  </p><p>“Maybe you should,” Oeyne countered, her smile no less delicious. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 30    Experience: 441500 / 465000 </p><p>Strength: 36    Charisma: 51</p><p>Precision: 33    Perception: 35</p><p>Agility: 33     Manipulation: 38</p><p>Speed: 32       Intelligence: 42</p><p>Endurance: 30      Wisdom: 44</p><p>HP: 4920 / 4920\tMana: 6300 / 6300        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Master Subterfuge [97/100]         </p><p>Master Arcana [91/100]        </p><p>Expert Speech [68/75]</p><p>Advanced Craft [40/50]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 17/25] </p><p>[Helga - Level 13/17] </p>",

    "content": "<p>Deciding how to progress with Aria was a tough decision. On the one hand, I wanted to encourage her to make sluttier decision on her own, as the more addicted she got to the lifestyle, the more she would find herself linked to me, not to mention I did want to see her shed her innocent guise and do her best to seduce me for another heated session of sex. On the other hand, it was really tempting to bend her over, lock her with the same chains that kept me imprisoned for weeks, and take her while she moaned obediently. </p><p>One of the most difficult questions I had ever faced in my life. </p><p>Ultimately, after a long break I took to think while Aria tried to catch her breath, I made a decision, and the former won. It was a difficult decision, though, as the desire to see her rocking on my lap in her will was barely able to beat the desire to repeat the encounter in her bedroom, only in a different environment. </p><p>Then, I turned my attention to Aria, still on her knees, with her dress pulled down to her waist, revealing her sexy satin corset. “That was an excellent performance,” I said.</p><p>“Thanks,” she murmured, a smile adorning her lips. Despite what she had just done, her smile still retained its innocent nature, though, with their stained and bruised state, they simultaneously managed to awaken the desire for sexiness even more. </p><p>This was what they should have done in the first place to torture me. If they showed Aria to me like this, I doubted I could have resisted for long before folding… </p><p>When I saw her hands grab her dress like she was about to pull it up, I was quick to stop her. “What are you doing? That was just the first phase of your test,” I reminded her. “You need to show me you retain everything I had taught you.” </p><p>“Everything…” she repeated with a gasp, her eyes locked at my shaft, which was midway in returning its peak performance after the earlier release. </p><p>“Yes, everything,” I repeated. “And since you have already grabbed your dress, why don’t you get rid of it, it’ll only get in the way later on.” </p><p>“But what if someone else comes,” she whispered. </p><p>I stood up, leaving my chains behind and caressing her cheek gently, a touch that made her shiver, but still, I was happy to note that she leaned toward my hand rather than flinching away. It was weird just how starved she was too positive attention that despite the rather extreme situation we were in, she was enjoying the intimacy of our touch… Of course, that didn’t have any bearing on what I was planning on next. “Don’t worry, I have upgraded the wards at the entrance, I won’t miss any arrivals,” I said, the implied ‘this time’ ringing in the room before saying anything. The last time, Emma’s arrival had been a rather interesting surprise, though thankfully, she had fucked badly enough so I could turn that into a positive without losing anything. </p><p>She nodded hesitantly. I could see in her beautiful blue eyes that she wanted to ask whether I was sure, but ultimately, lacked the will to utter them, even in such a soft position. Instead, she grabbed her dress, and pushed it down, revealing her plump thighs that begged for my fingers to dive, and just like her corset, her surprisingly sexy panties. They were made of red and white satin as well, and also transparent enough to reveal Aria had been shaving regularly in her most intimate area. </p><p>“You’re beautiful,” I murmured even as I sat down once again, which earned me blush and a grateful smile. “Now, why don’t you move onto the next part, and show me how well you can put those hips to use.” </p><p>“R-right now,” she murmured as she grabbed her tits. “Maybe we could…” she murmured, her words fading away, but what she meant was clear from the way she squeezed her tits together. </p><p>“Interesting,” I said, impressed by the fact that she came up with an alternative solution, especially when she said the alternative solution was to employ her breasts, which might be the best I had ever seen or touched —and I was talking from a large, and rather spectacular, comparison base… “Sure, as long as you impress me with a little dance first as you get rid of your top,” I said. After watching the Queen’s spectacular stripping show, I wondered if any of it was genetic. </p><p>“R-right now,” she stammered. </p><p>“That, or the other thing,” I said with a wide smile, which was all the encouragement she needed to start swaying gently. And just to make things more fun, I started humming the same sensual melody the Queen was undressing while she stood against the crowd of rich guys while she was in her fake identity. It was a beautiful, rhythmic melody.</p><p>Aria adapted to the music at a speed that left no doubt that she had been trained extensively in the art of dancing. She lacked the sheer sexiness or the suggestiveness of the Queen, but she was more than making up to that with her clumsy innocence, staggering whenever she did a sexy pose, whether it was leaning forward to enhance her cleavage to the limit, or bending backward to display her plump ass. </p><p>However, as she danced, she was slowly getting in the mood, as evidenced by the growing wetness on her panties. “It’s time for you to start dancing on my lap, sweetheart,” I reminded her, inviting her to sit on my naked lap. </p><p>She did so, with a hesitation that barely survived a minute, and pressed her plump ass against my crotch —and her back against my chest— and without any additional prompting, started rocking gently, the thin fabric of her satin panties making her touch even softer. “You’re an excellent dancer, sweetie,” I whispered into her ear even as I grabbed her tits over her corset, but at this point of our game, I had no intention of limiting myself to just rubbing her tits over her clothing. </p><p>“Get rid of it,” I whispered, interrupting my humming with a low rumble. </p><p>“This soon,” she whispered, but despite the panic her voice conveyed, her hips were starting to move quicker.</p><p>“Get rid of it,” I repeated quickly, and this time, she was quick to follow my command, her hands entered my field of view, trying to open her own corset. It was an activity that would take a few seconds, and I decided to put my own hands to a better use meanwhile. I grabbed the sides of her panties, and due to their delicate nature, they were ripped in pieces with just one pull, just as she managed to open the hooks of her corset, leaving her practically naked. </p><p>“That’s not what you promised,” she gasped as she felt my cock buried between her asscheeks, which once again surprised me. Maybe my treatment was finally teaching her how to say no. </p><p>Pity that she was just an elementary student of the art, because, despite her words, her hips stayed where they were, with no attempt to get away. Moreover, they continued to rock, giving a delicious treatment to my imprisoned cock. I was thankful for my earlier climax, as, without it, I doubted I could have lasted long under the sensations generated by her ass. It wasn’t what she had promised earlier, but I had no complaints about being shortchanged. </p><p>So, rather than asking her to change positions, I grabbed her tits and pulled her tighter, so that her back smashed against my chest while I dug into her breasts as deep as I wished, her moans echoing in my ears. It was a delicious moment I had no problems extending as much as possible, because it was almost as good as the sex itself. Not completely, but enough that extending the foreplay felt like an opportunity rather than a chore. </p><p>That was why I was surprised when she suddenly spoke. “We shouldn’t go further,” she suddenly said without prompting. </p><p>“As you wish, Princess,” I readily agreed as I enjoyed the dance of her hips. Surprisingly, the movement range of her hips increased.</p><p>Even more surprisingly, she spoke again. “We shouldn’t do more, it’s wrong,” she begged, which once again contrasted with her movements, getting larger and larger. </p><p>I was tempted to delve deeper into the discrepancy, and let one of my hands move lower, until I was caressing her wet folds. I slipped a finger, and she accepted it readily, almost sucking it inside. And the resulting moan was spectacular, innocent yet inviting at the same time. The enthusiasm in her moan finally clued me to her little game. As we extended our little foreplay, the pleasure finally overcame her resistance, but she was too innocent to actually ask for more. </p><p>It was the perfect opportunity I was waiting for. I slipped two fingers inside her, pumping a few times to make sure she was further along the edge —just as insurance— before I pulled out my fingers, and pressed my lips against her ear. “You know what, Princess, you’re right,” I said, which finally did the trick, and she stiffened in shock. “If you’re not feeling ready, you can stand up, dress, and leave the room without a punishment. What do you say?” </p><p>She was facing the other way, but it didn’t take a genius to imagine her expression without looking, an expression of utter shock, her innocence marred by her arousal… “But-” she gasped in shock, but failed to continue. </p><p>“No buts,” I whispered as I let my arms fall to the side, leaving the contact to her initiative. “You have two options. You can just stand up and leave, or you can move your hips a bit and skewer yourself with my shaft to further your training. Your choice.” </p><p>I wasn’t surprised when she froze for almost a minute as she was beset by her complicated thoughts. However, I was surprised when rather than moving her hips a bit and taking my shaft inside, she stood up. </p><p>Fuck, I thought, shocked by her action. I was so sure that her surrender was guaranteed. I froze, measuring the relative merits of pushing her against the wall and tease her until she begged to be fucked, or letting her go so that she would be even hornier the next time… </p><p>Then, she surprised me again by turning to face me rather than reaching for her dress, her blue eyes locked to mine, deliciously shiny, which was almost as impressive as the full-frontal view of her naked body, with her perfect tits and her invitingly wet slit and everything else. “This is just for training, right? Nothing else?\" she asked anxiously, begging for me not to get rid of her last excuse. </p><p>I was struck with a rare moment of mercy as I examined her body. “Of course, sweetie,” I whispered. “This is just for training… You’re doing nothing wrong. It’s for you to become the best possible bride you can.” </p><p>“T-thanks,” she whispered as she sat on my lap once more, but with two critical differences. First, this time she was facing toward me. Second, and more importantly, she aligned herself so that when she sat down, her entrance was aligned perfectly for me to slide inside her wetness, my grunt of satisfaction mixing with her gasp of pleasure. </p><p>“Now, show me how well you learned,” I whispered, and grabbed her hands, only to bring them to my neck, giving her the perfect leverage to cut loose. </p><p>She started slow, pushing her hips down slowly until she barely took a third of my shaft, before she pulled out even slower, leaving me to gasp in anticipation. “It’s an excellent start,” I whispered as I grabbed her breasts, squeezing them as gently as she was riding me. I avoided touching her hips, because I wasn’t sure I could resist the temptation of setting the pace. No, since it came to this point, I wanted her to take the lead in all aspects, including setting the pace. </p><p>Then, without a warning, she suddenly plunged down, enveloping most of my length, her wet tightness overwhelming. “Fuck, you're tight!\" I gasped.</p><p>Aria didn’t say anything, just moaned as her hips quickened. A more surprising fact was that her eyes were locked to mine, as I would have expected her to keep her eyes closed in an effort to deny what was going on. It was a pleasant surprise, though. </p><p>Since she was already close to the edge, it wasn’t a surprise for her moans to rose unbidden while the movement of her hips continued to quicken, until the sound of our flesh colliding mixed in the room. Finding happiness in small things was the secret to happiness, and I was the best example of it. Another dark lord would have probably preferred to kill himself to prevent his capture, or if not, would have escaped at the first opportunity to restart the struggle. I was more than happy to wait for the perfect opportunity, while sharing the dubious companionship of an innocent princess instead… </p><p>A grin invaded my face as my shaft repeatedly invaded Aria’s depths, while her pacing slowly gained a frantic aspect. And the speed was working excellently to bring me toward a climax. Unfortunately, Aria arrived at her destination much quicker than I did, so even her sudden tightness was unable to trigger my climax. “Don’t you dare to stop!” I whispered into her ear even as I twisted her nipples, waking her from her trance with a jolt of pain. Her hips reacted quicker than she did, moving automatically as her gorgeous hips tightened around me… </p><p>Her riding turned into a frantic bouncing. “Are you satisfied with my training methods?” I suddenly asked her. </p><p>“Yes,” came the reply immediately, accompanied by an earth-shattering cry, the combination of the pleasure she was feeling and the feeling of control successfully suppressing her shyness. No doubt temporarily, but made the moment only hotter… I didn’t say anything else, letting her focus on the task of bringing me to a climax. </p><p>“I’m almost here,” I whispered. It took two seconds for her to process my words under the rush of pleasure, and she was late by a moment, as just as a tinge of panic entered her eyes, I was spurting my first load into her. She tried to raise herself, only for my hands to clamp on her plump ass, preventing her escape. “Too late,” I whispered. </p><p>Under my hold, she abandoned her escape attempt quickly, instead of closing her eyes to focus on the sensation of being filled… </p><p>She leaned against my chest, trying to catch her breath, while I whispered. “Excellent work, my dear student,” I whispered. “I couldn’t wait for our next class.” </p><p>She said nothing, but her lack of reaction while my cock was inside her, still throbbing, while I promised a repeat, was telling enough… </p>",

    "content": "<p>After the battle and the miraculous victory I somehow managed to pull through a collection of recklessness, mysterious abilities, and sheer luck, I just lay on my back, doing my best to resist the tendrils of unconsciousness. Ironically, the pain of the half-completed spell had worked well to push the unconsciousness away. </p><p>It took me more than an hour to move even a finger, and I was lucky that the animals that lived in the mountain were quite sensitive to magic —due to their environment, they wouldn’t have survived without the said sensitivity— so they stayed away from our magical battlefield until I could start recovering, which took me much longer compared to the wound when I faced against the disaster class wolf. There, I somehow managed to summon lightning to cure myself, but this time, I didn’t dare to replicate the feat, not when the culprit for my current injuries was yet another lightning spell. </p><p>Instead, I relied on the conventional healing spells, some of which designed specifically for Sorcerer-level power and capabilities, unearthed from the forbidden section of the library. I gathered my mana, trying to cast a slow-recovery spell that would slowly handle most of the damages. It wasn’t the most precise healing spell available to me, but compared to the others, it was more robust, not requiring finicky mana control. </p><p>After I cast that, putting a majority of my mana to enhance its impact, a subtle warmth covered my body, blunting the worst of the pain. Pity that it only lasted for a few seconds, before the pain returned tenfold. My body was resisting the spell. “Damn it,” I gasped in anger, even though it wasn’t fair for me to blame the abnormal state of my body, as without it, I wouldn’t have survived the encounter long enough to use that last spell, and using that would have turned me into ashes and dust rather than just wounding me. I waited to gather enough mana, and repeated the spell with some extra power. </p><p>Unlike my expectations, the healing warmth had survived even less this time, like my body was rejecting it. For the third repeat, I tried to use a different spell, but this time, I didn’t even feel the sensation of the warmth that indicated the spell was working. Instead, I felt a painful reaction from my body, like something was pushing the spell out, rejecting its control. So, for the next repeat, I only focused on my hand, casting the strongest spell I could manage while aiming at a small location. </p><p>The jolt of pain that went through my body was even worse than the miscast lightning spell that gave me the victory at the end of the combat. I could feel my muscles twisting and my skin crawling as something in my body forced the healing spell out, forcefully scouring the remains of the healing energy from my body. </p><p>When managed to open my eyes after pain reached a manageable point, I raised my hand once more, only to meet a shocking sight. Instead of my hand, I was looking at a claw. A large, threatening claw that was covered with silver scales, not unlike a snake… </p><p>“Just what I needed,” I murmured, relying on sarcasm to suppress the terror that rose from my heart, as I was faced with an incomprehensible issue. Somehow, my body was transforming into an animal. It wasn’t impossible magically, as the strongest druids were famed for their ability to transform into superior animals. And while I didn’t know much about druidic traditions, everything I had learned from Astrid told me that it was a highly ritualistic achievement that took months of dedicated work to achieve, not something to be attained as a result of a botched spell. </p><p>I knew what it was about, of course, but wished that I didn’t. Everything about dragon hearts, including their source and the effects, was wrapped in a mystery, so much that even their existence was half myths. I doubted that I would be able to find someone else stupid enough to eat one as I did rather than carefully absorbing it for years and decades. </p><p>However, I didn’t have time to waste by generating useless theories about the source of my transformation, especially since I could see another part of my skin transforming into a scale. Since healing spells were not working, I decided to call the lightning once more. It was risky as a solution, but at least, it was a better solution than cutting my own arm —especially since there was no guarantee amputation would help in the first place. </p><p>With great effort, I managed to sit with my legs crossed, and called the special lightning from the sky once more. The contrast with the healing spell was spectacular. Rather than soothing immediately, it stung rather badly at first, but even as my body switched, I could feel myself strengthening. The lightning seeped into my skin, flowing in my veins alongside my blood, repairing the ruins of the spell. Maybe it was because the damage was mostly from a lightning spell, or maybe my body was slowly adapting to this irregular healing method, but this time, my healing speed was even faster. </p><p>The biggest change, however, happened on my arm. The silver scales burned brightly as they absorbed the lightning, stray bolts jumping between the tips of the claw. However, the bright explosion didn’t survive for long, and soon, the scales melted back to my skin. </p><p>I had my hand once more, I realized with a smile. It did feel quite a bit different than the rest of my body, but I was afraid of testing it anymore. Whatever was happening in my body, I didn’t want to risk it. </p><p>With the decision made, I walked back to the hidden city.</p><p>*****     *****     *****     *****     *****     *****     </p><p>Just like that, three months had passed, where my time was split between three actions, researching in the library, patrolling the perimeter to make sure the legionaries didn’t dare to send another team, and spending quality time with the girls. However, I avoided practicing magic as much as possible, because I discovered that whatever had happened my body was not even close to being complete, and the more I used magic, the more it progressed. The girls, not sharing my disadvantage, improved greatly in terms of magic, greatly surpassing my expectations. I wouldn’t be surprised if both of them stepped into the ranks of the Sorcery before the next year. </p><p>Still, they weren’t Sorcerer’s yet, which was the reason I was standing at the main entrance of the city, with the girls looking at me sadly. “Are you sure we can’t come with you?” asked Astrid.</p><p>“No,” I answered sadly, as I really loved their company. “The legionaries are finally gone, but there’s no guarantee that the one behind them had stopped his search. If we travel together, we might get discovered.” </p><p>“We can disguise ourselves,” Lillian offered, looking hopeful despite the several arguments we had on the topic. </p><p>“No, impossible,” I said. “Even if you girls used magic to hide you from that man, and used more mundane disguises to hide your beauty, a man traveling with two women will get people’s attention, forcing us to fight to keep you two from their hungry hands.” </p><p>“We will win,” Astrid cut in. </p><p>“Oh, yes, we will win,” I said with a sigh. “But with every victory, we will get some more attention, until we finally get noticed by the wrong eyes. No, I need to go, while you stay and work for your ascension.” I was exasperated because of the pointless argument, one we had been repeating since I decided to leave the mountain to search for more information. </p><p>After one last kiss, I turned and left, launching my journey. </p><p>It was disappointing not to find the source of my problem in the library, but ultimately, it wasn’t shocking, considering the city was designed as a secret military base, ready to house an army. The information hidden in the library was mostly focused on enhancing people’s military prowess rather than examining esoteric magical conditions with weird mystic connections. I was already lucky that I managed to find some clues for my condition. </p><p>The fact that I found some clues were good, but the same couldn’t be said for the destination of those clues. In the library, I had discovered some of the handwritten memories of Julius Caesar, and much to my surprise, some of the things he mentioned from his youth were similar to my lightning powers. </p><p>Particularly, when he had been a priest of Jupiter —until his uncle Gaius Marius had lost a civil war against the dictator Sulla. After that, the only thing that saved Caesar’s life was her mother’s mysterious connections to Vestal Virgins, a secretive religious order, though they weren’t as mysterious as the priesthood of Jupiter. The priesthood of Jupiter was so mysterious that they were not allowed to sleep outside the borders of Rome, and they were explicitly forbidden from doing anything military. They were shrouded in the mystery. </p><p>But Caesar, due to his sensitive political nature, achieved something impossible and was allowed to retire from the order with his life intact. His notes about that part of his youth didn’t include many details, understandable considering it was his darkest days —with his father and uncle dead, and his family power in tatters, forced to escape Rome just to make sure he didn’t fall victim to an assassin’s dagger. </p><p>He didn’t go too many details in his memoirs, whether he deemed the details to be unimportant, or feared to commit the secrets of the Jupiter’s priesthood secret even in his own secret fortress city —and considering the great importance the temple of Jupiter held over Rome, the latter was quite likely— was unknown, but the casual description of several lightning-natured spells the high priests had used in his presence was similar to my spells. </p><p>It was a long shot, but ultimately, it was my only hope… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Since the encounter with Penny had ended without a true release to keep her wanting for more, I had found myself with a raging boner aching for a release. Luckily, I had the perfect person for me to handle that. The time it took me to return the rental car didn’t help my arousal any. </p><p>On my way to return, the arousal was starting to get rather unbearable. A quick look at the hidden camera feed I had installed revealed that Nicole was in the living room, with no sign of the girls. Katie was at her school, and it was still too early for Nancy to wake up. I wrote her a quick message. ‘I’m about to come back. Wear a French maid costume, and wait for me at the foyer,’ the message said. </p><p>I was pushing my luck. Nicole had impressed me with the extent of her submissiveness, accepting obediently no matter how much I had pushed her. But it was with one particular caveat. For the other encounters, I was next to her, pushing, dominating, and seducing as needed. </p><p>It was the first proper test of my remote domination. </p><p>Of course, I wouldn’t dare to do that without the cameras around the basement and the first floor, allowing me to observe the situation, ready to be involved in case of an emergency. </p><p>So, I was watching while Nicole lay on the seat in front of the TV, enjoying the silence of the house by lazing around. I couldn’t help but feel fascinated by her though, as even when wearing a boring pair of sweatpants and a loose t-shirt, she looked ravishing —though her obvious lack of a bra did play a critical role on that particular aspect.   </p><p>Then, her phone buzzed, and her expression transformed completely the moment she checked the screen, relaxation was replaced by panic, but I was familiar with her enough to notice the signs of growing arousal even through the imprecise eyes of my secret cameras. </p><p>I watched as her fingers danced on the phone screen, writing and erasing several messages, trying to compose an answer, but since my phone didn’t ring even once, it meant that she failed to find the elusive message she had been searching for. </p><p>I decided to cut her search short. ‘I will be there in five minutes,’ read my next message. Her eyes widened immediately as she read that, and a moment later, she was on her feet, dashing toward the basement, the urgency of the situation cutting through her fears. </p><p>I didn’t switch to the basement camera, not wanting to watch her as she changed clothing, mostly to maintain the mystique of the moment, just like anticipating a present on a Christmas morning. After all, due to my various jobs, I had managed to collect more than a few French maid costumes, spread along a spectrum of functionality and sexiness, some almost enough to be wearable while working as a proper maid, some excessive anywhere but a stage in a seedy strip club… </p><p>Unfortunately, Nicole stayed in the basement as I drove back, leaving me to suffer in anticipation. I was tempted to check the cameras to ruin the surprise, but after a lengthy struggle, I managed to resist the temptation. Though, I didn’t forget to send a reminder just before I took the turn that would bring me the street of the house. ‘Don’t forget to wait for me at the entrance,’ the message reminded her. </p><p>Still, until I pulled on the driveway, Nicole stayed in the basement. I was about to discard my little test as a failure when the door to the basement finally opened. She pushed her head out hesitantly, looking around to make sure the coast was clear, her body hidden behind the cover of the door. I put my phone back in my pocket at this point, wanting to see the costume she selected with my own eyes. I didn’t expect much though, not if she could dare to walk the common areas wearing it. </p><p>I grabbed my camera and walked to the front door, not even bothering to bring the rest of the items inside, my shaft throbbing hard enough to hurt. I couldn’t wait to rip whatever conservative costume Nicole had picked to wear. I knocked on the door, and she opened it… </p><p>Only for my mouth to fell open in shock. It turned out that Nicole hadn’t opted for one of the more conservative costumes, ones that covered her whole torso and had a proper skirt. Instead, she had gone to the other side of the spectrum. </p><p>Like most maid's outfit, it was black with white lace trim and a matching white lace headpiece, along with a pair of black fishnet thigh high stockings to complete the package, ending with stilettos. She also had a feather duster, implying a desire to work, no matter how improbable it was with the rest of her costume. More importantly, the costume also had a black satin ribbon choker, an under-appreciated but critical part of the French maid outfit. The choker was necessary to underline the subtle sense of ownership, which was the ultimate basis of the fantasy. After all, any lingerie would have shown more skin, but wouldn’t have matched the sexiness of the outfit. </p><p>Of course, the costume was lacking in several areas. For example, a backside, leaving her elegant back completely naked until where her panties started, wide enough to give a glimpse of the side of her boobs, removing any chance of putting on a bra to support her breasts —luckily, she didn’t need any support. </p><p>The second thing the costume lacked was a skirt that was long enough to cover her panties when she was doing anything other than standing completely straight. I could see her hands twitching, tempted to pull the costume down, but that risked pulling down the whole costume. It was already hanging on her body by luck and prayer, waiting for the slightest mistake to slide down, as it lacked any kind of strap to keep it up, leaving her elegant shoulders completely naked. Also, even without pulling the whole costume down, the cleavage was outrageous enough, with a line low enough to reveal hints of her areolas, and dipping even deeper in the center. </p><p>Altogether, she was far too sexy to be put in a fashion magazine. No, anything less than a tasteful erotic magazine would have been fined aggressively for putting her in. </p><p>Luckily, she was all for me. Putting her out for commercial shoots was one thing, but I had no intention of revealing her to the public truly. No, she was mine. </p><p>From her fidgeting, I realized that I had lost quite a bit of time examining her costume, which made her anxious. To my defense, the revealing costume was a perfect fit for her curvy figure, especially with my raging arousal. “Shouldn’t a maid greet the owner of the house?” I suggested with a smirk, clutching on the role-play to muddy the supposed power balance between the landlady and the houseguest even further. </p><p>She blushed at my words, but that didn’t prevent her from stepping into my arms after I parted them invitingly. Her slender arms wrapped lightly around my waist, while I chose to go even lower, and my hands landed on the naked cheeks of her plump ass, checking her panties. At first, I thought them absent, but as I continued to explore the expanse under the deficient cover of her skirt, my fingers finally caressed it, which was barely more than a thin string struggling not to disappear in her cleft. A g-string was braver than I had expected. </p><p>To make it a proper greeting, I leaned and captured her lips, my tongue darting out. Surprisingly, it discovered hers halfway, creating a mini-embrace, no less delicious. Curious at her sudden show of initiative, I didn’t press further, only for her to run her tongue across my lip. I let her take control of the kiss completely, and her tongue continued darting forward, playing with my tongue and lips. Her arms around my waist tightened, pulling me closer. While I felt the pressure of her spectacular tits on my chest along with her deepened breathing, I spent my time deepening my grip on her plump ass. </p><p>We continued to share the kiss for gods knew for how long, shivers were running up and down my spine from the combination of her tongue and hands. From her excited humping, I could see that it was even worse for her. Apparently, my repeated efforts finally managed to awakened her arousal completely, so much that I didn’t need lengthy foreplay disguised as a photoshoot to get her motor running. Just ordering her to dress like a slut was enough. </p><p>She squeaked as I pinched her ass, but continued to kiss me for another minute before pulling back, proving that it wasn’t just her sense of obedience that was enabling her lewdness. </p><p>After the kiss stopped, I left her behind and walked toward the couch in the middle of the room, plopping myself down, much to her shocked look. “A-aren’t we going to have a photoshoot?” she asked as she walked closer, her eyes slipping toward the basement door, her fishnet-clad legs trembling in anticipation. </p><p>“No,” I answered even as I smirked at her, enjoying the way her beautiful eyes widened. “I wanted you to change because I wanted some eye candy as you cleaned up.” </p><p>“But …” she murmured, her shock palpable as her expression cycled while she tried to complete her words, only to fail halfway. “What if Katie comes home early, or Nancy wakes up?” she asked. </p><p>“Well, you better work fast, then,” I suggested. There was nothing preventing Nicole from walking away after slamming the duster in my head, but also, there had been nothing that forced her to wear the sluttiest maid costume she could find; other than her own desires, as evidenced by the wetness on the center of her panties, visible whenever she walked. “Why don’t you start by dusting,” I offered. </p><p>Her expression of indecision barely survived under my decisive gaze. “A-as you wish,” she murmured. </p><p>“Is this the way a maid should talk the master of the house?” I suggested, feeling lucky enough to push my luck even further. </p><p>“I-I’m sorry, sir. As you wish, sir,” she said, her smile surprisingly wide after I nodded. When she walked toward the nearest table with her duster raised, there was a palpable spring in her steps. She started dusting the place obediently, keeping her attention on the task, but that didn’t prevent her from providing me an excellent glimpse whenever she tried to reach something, whether she was facing me or her back was turned against me. </p><p>Initially, I was planning to tease her a bit more, maybe take a bunch of photos for my private collection, but the view of her ass, straining her g-string as if it was trying to escape its confining prison managed to change my mind. Five minutes of watching her clean were all could handle before I decided to act. “Bring me a glass of scotch,” I ordered her. </p><p>“Yes, sir,” she gasped, her voice tinged with arousal, recognizing the signal hidden in the change in tone. She went to the kitchen, her hips dancing temptingly. It might be hard to walk unsexily with a micro-skirt and a pair of stilettos in the first place, but Nicole really turned the heat up to eleven, her ass dancing with every single step, begging for me to stand up and take her on the kitchen floor. I managed to resist, but it was a close call. </p><p>From the rare hint of smugness flickering on her otherwise obedient expression as she walked toward me, carrying a generous glass of scotch, with no ice just like I liked. “You think you’re clever, don’t you, teasing your employer like this,” I whispered, and she smiled softly, but not completely free of smugness. </p><p>“If my employer has a problem, maybe he could punish me in his bedroom,” she whispered. </p><p>“Good idea,” I whispered, and her smile widened. “Only partially, though,” I added, and her smile flickered. </p><p>“What do you mean?” </p><p>“Since I’m your employer, I don’t need your opinion about the best place to punish you. And I’m not in the mood.”</p><p>“But…” she whispered, her smile erased by panic, but her arousal stayed constant. “What if the girls come early…” </p><p>“Not my problem,” I answered immediately, aware that I was once again pushing my luck, but from her reaction to the maid costume, I was reasonably sure that it would be successful. “You should have thought that before teasing your employer. Now, on your knees,” I said. </p><p>“But…” she repeated, but her halfhearted complaint didn’t have the slightest importance, not when she followed my order after a second of delay, and crouched in front of me, the angle giving me a perfect view into her cleavage. </p><p>It was going to be fun… </p>",

    "content": "<p>After making the last deduction, I continued sitting, listening as Titania finished her explanation. Just as I predicted, I felt the tendrils of headmistress’ mana probing my soul space once again after Titania explained the final fate of the Death Knights, though it was smoother than her previous attempt. Less wary, for a lack of better term. Maybe the perceived ease of success she had experienced the last time made her more confident. </p><p>Considering her age that spanned centuries and her implied power, her flight of confidence was understandable. I could certainly empathize with it, as I had suffered my own share of those bouts, the most recent one being daring to probe her simultaneously. Of course, it was possible that it was a giant double-bluff on her part, but I didn’t want to focus on that probability. Not because of the relative unlikeness, but because if she was aware of my tricks and playing me, there wasn’t a lot I could do against it. There was no chance I could stand against it, certainly not in her seat of power. </p><p>So, rather than going into a complicated assessment of possibilities, I tried to focus on what I could do, and analyzed her probe to the best of my ability. The bright nature of her mana was not a surprise at this point, but I still made sure to give a detailed examination, making sure it wasn’t a trick to mislead me. Luckily, she was making it very easy by pushing her mana inside my soul space —a fake one, but still, firmly under my control. </p><p>However, the more I examined, the more shocked I felt. The Light was the true nature of her mana, which, despite its unassuming status, was actually a very critical finding. Because, a mage’s mana took the flavor of their strongest abilities, ultimately, it was just that, a flavor, something that happened only on the surface, with only flakes of transformation affecting the core unless it was an actively-cast spell. </p><p>The headmistress’ mana was not like that. It was almost pure Light magic even in its resting state —with hints of darkness that felt like contamination, possible to detect only because I had felt the weird pulsating darkness in its core, allowing me to assess with a more discerning eye. </p><p>She pulled her probe before I could delve deeper into the mystery of her mana. I didn’t feel disappointed, because I was sure that having a couple of extra minutes wouldn’t help me solve that particular mystery. I simply lacked far too many variables. Maybe it was about bringing one’s skills to absolute perfection —if such a thing even existed in the first place— or maybe it was related to the Acolyte ability of Titania that had been suppressing her emotion, but only stronger. </p><p>Maybe was something completely different…</p><p>So, when the headmistress finally spoke once more, after a minute of silence following Titania’s story, I didn’t have any trouble abandoning that particular line of thought for a later date. “You were lucky,” she said in her cracking, raspy voice that screamed old. “You managed to survive Zokras the Eternal’s rage.” </p><p>I didn’t have a reaction to her statement, which was okay, as Titania reacted for both of us with a loud gasp. I was so lucky that her emotional state was also a side effect of mana exhaustion, as otherwise, the headmistress might have got suspicious enough to check her. “Impossible,” Titania gasped. “Is he still alive?” I chuckled at her description of a lich, and she slapped my shoulder immediately. “Shut up,” she murmured shyly. “You know what I mean.”</p><p>“Sorry,” I said unapologetically, while I could feel the headmistress’s attention sharpening further from a slight shift in her posture. In such a secretive person, that was the equivalent of a dramatic gasp. At this point, a little flirting was the best chance to distract her from the really important secrets. It wasn’t like Titania was able to hide her emotions during her explanation. “So, who is this Zokras?” </p><p>“He’s one of the oldest liches known, and a major reason the undead are still a major threat rather than a pest that slammed down where it occurred,” Titania explained. “Almost two hundred years ago, the Empire led a crusade against a coalition of dark, and according to the stories, a deadly ambush from Zokras was one of the major reasons for failure. Though I don’t know how accurate the story was, as according to the stories, he was supposed to be destroyed completed. ” </p><p>I turned to the headmistress, and she just nodded. “No, he escaped,” she said, and for the first time, I felt a tinge of emotion in her tone. Fury. Pure, unadulterated fury. Then a flicker of aura accompanied it, one that burned as bright as the sun, threatening to eradicate the darkness that filled the room. It lasted barely a fraction of a second, and even I would have missed its nature if I wasn’t deliberately looking for light magic, but the intensity and purity of her ability were shocking. </p><p>However, her momentary flare of anger didn’t come without a cost. She started coughing, followed by a flare of darkness, which also came from her. Whatever the darkness she had in, it broke the containment for a while, and her painful coughs were the result. Titania stood up, ready to help, but the headmistress stopped her. “Sit down, child,” she murmured. “I’m not old enough to be taken down by an old wound…” </p><p>That was another mystery revealed, I realized. However, unlike Titania’s accidental slips, I had no doubt that the headmistress had revealed that fact intentionally, though it was more of leveraging her earlier failure of containment rather than a planned ploy, because, despite her best efforts, I could see her arms trembling under her imposing robe. Her intention wasn’t hard to guess either. With the appearance of her old enemy Zokras, she clearly needed some more allies, and despite my lack of background, I was a good ally, after proving myself without a doubt by destroying five Death Knights of Zokras, proving both my abilities and my side on the upcoming battle, without a doubt. </p><p>“Is there anything I can do to help?” I offered despite knowing she wouldn’t accept. “I have a fair hand in healing spells.” </p><p>“No need,” she whispered. “Unfortunately, curing it is a bit more difficult than a fresh cut.” I nodded at her kind dismissal, but said nothing else while she examined me carefully. “You’re a surprising variable,” she finally muttered. “What exactly do you seek that made you hide in my school for several years under a fake identity?” she finally asked. </p><p>“Oh, this and that,” I murmured, doing my best to keep my expression calm. The fact that she assumed my presence was a carefully-arranged fake posting was very reasonable. Based on the facts in hand, that was the only reasonable conclusion. After all, who would assume that until less than a month, I was nothing more than a simpering fool, walking around like a hypnotized ape, stupid and weak? Her assumption about my roots was a bit curious though, as it was rather difficult to make sure I hadn’t killed the previous Mule and took his identity weeks ago. Maybe she had a mysterious method to validate that, or maybe she was just relying on the information Titania provided. </p><p>Though regardless of her method, her attempts of the investigation were doomed to fail, simply because her initial assumption was faulty. My sudden increase of power was impossible to be factored in. </p><p>“This and that,” the headmistress murmured, her croaky voice gaining a threatening edge, accompanied by her magical pressure. </p><p>Despite her naked intimidation, I looked at her coolly, without flinching. She might be stronger than me, but after killing those Death Knights, and with her obvious attempts to recruit me to her inner circle, I held all the cards. Combine that with the fact that it was impossible to unearth about the ‘mysterious organization’ that supported me, the headmistress had a hand too weak to even threaten a dire rabbit… “Yes,” I murmured in the same tone. “This and that.” </p><p>Funnily enough, it was Titania that broke our standoff, by rudely kicking me in the shin. “Don’t be an asshole,” she chided me. “You’re doing that intentionally.” </p><p>“Sorry,” I said to Titania with a chuckle, before turning toward the headmistress once more. “Well, actually I was doing less than you might expect. I’m mostly here to do some confidential research, searching for some ancient secrets that need to stay unmentioned for the moment. It’s more like an extended holiday after my latest mission rather than a true mission, actually. A bit of reading, some sightseeing, and maybe some recruitment of sharper candidates, but those are all bonuses.” Still, even as I said those words, I had to suppress my heartbeat to a more normal level. I was confident in my position, but it still didn’t change the fact that I was giving lip to one of the most dangerous people I had ever encountered —which is a toss-up between her and Zokras. </p><p>“Yet you’re in the middle of my fight with the biggest undead coalition that had seen since two centuries,” the headmistress countered. “Wouldn’t that make your bosses unhappy?” </p><p>“Eeh,” I murmured as I shook my hand dismissively. “We’re not that strict when it comes to following orders. And we can’t exactly talk about bosses. We’re more like a loose collection of individuals, concerned about the inevitable decline of the world, doing our best to limit the damages. It wouldn’t be the first time I destroyed an army full of undead, or assassinated a few pesky necromancers with more ambition than sense without any confirmation from the rest of the group.” </p><p>“How interesting,” the headmistress murmured while I was impressed by the bullshit I was able to spew, though her tone maintained its usual croaky quality. “Is there any chance for your group to send more assistance, and in return, we might discuss what Silver Spires could do to support them once the current crisis has passed. Maybe I could help you search your ancient texts.” </p><p>“Let’s not go into a discussion of reward immediately,” I quickly cut her off, not wanting to reveal what I was searching for. I didn’t want to reveal anything about my power, because not only I didn’t trust her for anything above this crisis, but also revealing it would unravel my nice blanket of lies, leaving me unprotected against outside ploys. “However, I’m going to mention the possibility to the rest of the group, and then we’ll see if there’s any spare manpower they could afford to share. But don’t expect anything in the short term, as one of the disadvantages of the decentralized organization is a slow response time.” </p><p>The headmistress nodded, no doubt confused by the plethora of possibilities that our talk had implied. The silence stretched, a minute at first, then two, elongating further and further. I wondered whether she was trying to come to a decision, or using another intimidation tactic, though I had a feeling that it was both. </p><p>Her next words carried a surprise, more to Titania than me, though my shock was considerably strong as well. “Would you be interested in a personal trade, the power of light magic, in exchange for a tighter coordination between us during the crisis,” she offered. </p><p>“You can’t,” Titania gasped in shock. “With your injury that might-” she tried to continue, only for the headmistress to silence her with a gesture. </p><p>“Enough, I know my health more than you,” she warned Titania before turning toward me. “What do you think?” </p><p>“I didn’t know it was possible to just acquire abilities, especially when it came to rare abilities like light magic, but it sounds like a good deal,” I said, acting like I had no idea about what she had in mind. Still, even those words alone were a sufficient treasure from this meeting. Just by a sentence, I learned that Titania’s Acolyte status was either directly from the headmistress, or she was somehow a conduit to it —considering the pure light nature of her mana, I was more inclined to think it was the first. </p><p>Which made my decision not to reveal my secrets even better, considering the implied rivalry —as implied by my achievements, with a mysterious intensity which might range from friendly competition to outright hatred— between the source of my power and the light magic. </p><p>“There are many secrets buried in the history of the System, and many ways to go above its natural development,” the headmistress whispered theatrically, but in her tone, I could sense a hint of elation. Of course, why she felt so was a mystery, maybe she was happy that she discovered a strong hook, the information about the System, to bargain with my group, or maybe, she was happy with my interest in her power, hoping that its emotional-suppression abilities —and possible brainwashing capabilities— would help her to control me, or at least influence me. </p><p>“Sounds interesting,” I murmured. “May I have a day or two to think?” I asked, which earned a nod. “Excellent,” I murmured. “What should we do about the princess?” </p><p>For that, the headmistress shrugged. “Feel free to handle however you feel appropriate,” she said. “It fits better under your organization’s remit of preventing the decline.” </p><p>“As you wish,” I answered. I was impressed with her answer, as she suddenly turned a dangerous aspect of the crisis she was facing into a huge test for me, and my imaginary organization. Which meant I needed to pay more attention to the incoming visit of the princess. “Do you mind if I introduce myself as a hidden protector of the library, just to make discussion with the princess smoother?” The headmistress nodded. </p><p>I would have cursed my big mouth if I hadn’t been looking forward to getting acquainted with the princess in the first place. At least, in this way, I could take more overt actions, without a need to stay under notice all the time.  </p><p>After another lengthy pause, the headmistress pointed at the door, which was opened magically, signaling the end of the meeting. It was a bit unnecessary as a power move in my opinion. Still, I wasn’t surprised, as the more I learned about her, the more I realized just how much of her dangerous dark witch persona was constructed rather than natural. </p><p>“You can’t accept, she can’t handle another transfer,” Titania gasped in shock the moment we left the tower, her hands clasping around my arm desperately. </p><p>“Calm down,” I whispered, caressing her cheek gently. “You’re stressed and exhausted. Why don’t you go back to your room and try to sleep for a few hours while I go talk with my organization. Then, after you feel less frazzled, we can talk about it. But I promise I won’t make a decision without talking to you,” I whispered. It was rather easy to make promises when one didn’t care about the reward in question in the first place. For me, Titania herself was leagues more important than an extra skill, especially one that might hurt me as likely as it might help me. </p><p>“Thanks,” Titania murmured, and then with a surprising gesture, raised to her toes before stealing a gentle kiss, and dashed away shyly. </p><p>[+50 Experience]</p><p>“What a cute development,” I murmured in fascination as I turned my back, chuckling as I walked toward the Hall of Craft. </p><p>I wanted to test my newest skill and talk about the princess some more. Getting another taste of the caramel skin of Oeyne was just a bonus. </p><p>A very nice bonus…</p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 30    Experience: 441500 / 465000 </p><p>Strength: 36    Charisma: 51</p><p>Precision: 33    Perception: 35</p><p>Agility: 33     Manipulation: 38</p><p>Speed: 32       Intelligence: 42</p><p>Endurance: 30      Wisdom: 44</p><p>HP: 4920 / 4920\tMana: 6300 / 6300        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Master Subterfuge [97/100]         </p><p>Master Arcana [90/100]        </p><p>Expert Speech [66/75]</p><p>Advanced Craft [31/50]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 17/25] </p><p>[Helga - Level 13/17] </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Wow, that was exciting,” I murmured even as I hugged Titania on top of the strongest air elemental I had created on the cost of wasting quite a bit of mana, getting away from the underground base as fast as possible, which seemed like an excellent idea after I had triggered the trap with the four death knights at the epicenter, angering their owner. And based on the sheer strength and resistance those Death Knights displayed even before their owner buffed them to their maximum capacity, I managed to anger a mysterious corpse that was best left undisturbed. </p><p>For some reason, I had a feeling that after destroying five of his eight Death Knights which were strong enough to tank a full-powered strike from Titania, that mysterious lich might feel a smudge of grudge toward me. </p><p>Luckily, the two factors that ensured renown of the liches were their capacity for boundless mercy as well as their ability to take accidental setbacks in good humor! </p><p>Meanwhile, Titania was breathing wildly as she tried to process what had happened, the impact of the deadly situation hitting harder than she was used to without the protection of the emotional dampener, her breathing out of control. “Calm down,” I whispered into her ear even as I caressed her hair. “Whatever it was, we’re already moving too fast for it to catch up,” I murmured.</p><p>“What if it has a faster mount,” Titania gasped in shock. “Even his Death Knights was able to take my full-powered attack. How can an undead resist the destructive powers of the light? It’s impossible.” </p><p>It was clearly not impossible, but putting that out directly wouldn’t have helped Titania to calm down. So, rather than trying to explain, I hugged her tighter even as I used to cast a healing spell on her, to suppress her adrenaline and relax her out-of-control breathing for a while. </p><p>[-19 Mana]</p><p>“I’m sure that they had some special protections against light magic,” I murmured after she calmed down a bit more, trying to calm her down about her inability to take down Death Knights with one burst attack despite depleting her mana. “After all, you’re one of the biggest challenges for them. It makes sense for them to prepare specifically against you.” It didn’t exactly make sense, as while Titania was strong, the lich we faced shouldn’t need to work that much to take Titania down. </p><p>“You’re right,” she mumbled sleepily as she let herself relax against my chest, her eyes closed as we traveled, her tension draining without a follow-up assault. The exhaustion and the aftermath of the combat had caught up with her, and she didn’t have a monstrous Endurance to blunt the impact.  “They definitely have some counters against the light magic. Otherwise, they could never take down the headmistress…” </p><p>“Right,” I said even as I caressed her hair, letting her fell asleep. I was glad that she closed her eyes, because she missed the expression of shock that doubtlessly covered my face as a reaction to the secret she had slipped from her mouth. </p><p>She was confirming that the headmistress using light magic! I barely kept myself from gasping in shock. Neither my research, nor anything I had felt during my visit indicated anything about her using light magic —other than the dubious sensation I had felt from her probe. Titania’s confirmation didn’t simplify things. Rather, it made it even more complicated considering the aura of darkness in her room being so thick that I would have suspected her being in cohorts with the undead if it wasn’t for her position invalidating such a need. </p><p>Titania’s careless reveal about her true abilities put a rather interesting spin on things. Most importantly, it removed the possibility that the sensation of lightness was a unique trait of her probing, and elevated it into one of her core abilities. So, she was either like me, with a wide range of abilities, and hiding some of those as secondary secrets, or all the darkness was there to conceal her true abilities. </p><p>How interesting… </p><p>Since I had wasted an excessive amount of mana on the air elemental, we managed to arrive at the school in several minutes, including a small break I took to cure us.</p><p>[-74 Mana]</p><p>[-559 Mana]</p><p>[+1465 HP]</p><p>Still, the journey was not nearly enough to process all implications of the headmistress’s surprise ability. Pity that the presence of that lich was too important to delay reporting, so I took Titania with a bridal hold before sneaking inside. Only when we were in an empty corner not too far away from the headmistress’s office, I woke her up with a kiss on the cheek. </p><p>[+50 Experience]</p><p>She murmured gently like a particularly cute cat before she cracked her eyes to look around, only to realize we were on the feet of the headmistress’s tower. “Good morning,” I said mockingly. </p><p>“Shut up,” she murmured as she jumped up her feet, conjuring a mirror to check her face. Then, after making sure everything was in order, she grabbed my hand and tried to drag me toward the headmistress’s tower, only for me to stay still. “What are you waiting for, we need to talk with her and explain everything,” she said panickedly. “That lich is too dangerous.” </p><p>“I know, that’s why I brought you here,” I murmured, still trying to decide whether to go with her or not. Going with her, I risked revealing my secrets, but still, I was considering it. It wasn’t all negative, by being there, I could run interference between her and Titania, at least until Titania got a better handle of her new emotional state. Not to mention, I didn’t want to let Titania go for too long. The emergence of such a dangerous creature was a warning for me to get stronger even further. While the most critical part of it was the new weapons I was going to forge with Oeyne, more levels wouldn’t hurt, especially if I could use them to bring my capabilities even further. </p><p>Still, while I finally made the decision to accompany her, I still needed to give her an excuse for why I was hesitating. “Sorry, I was just thinking…” I murmured, faking indecisiveness. </p><p>“Thinking what,” she said. “Whatever it is, it can’t be as important as that scary undead. Let’s go.” </p><p>I still didn’t move, and when she looked at me angrily, I smirked at her. “I was thinking what to say if she asks how you regenerated your mana that quickly to go for a raid, and how you regenerated it further during the raid,” I explained. </p><p>“W-what!” she stammered, her earlier bravado evaporating instant. “What are you talking about?!” she said, slapping my shoulder just to underline it further. </p><p>I shrugged lazily. “It’s a valid question, but I can just answer her questions directly if you think it’s a pointless concern.” </p><p>“No!” she exclaimed. “You can’t tell her that! It’s… It’s… indecent,” she finished after a couple of attempts, her voice barely a whisper by the last word. </p><p>“Okay, then you should explain it.” </p><p>“No need,” Titania cut it off. “If she asks, I strained myself too much, and need a couple of days to recover.” Then, she looked at me threateningly while pinched my hand. “Nothing else, understood.” </p><p>I nodded, but rather than answering, I sneaked forward and stole another kiss from her beautiful lips. </p><p>[+50 Experience]</p><p>Her frustrated growl afterward was too exaggerated to be genuine, not to mention, if she disliked it, it would mean her tongue got into my mouth accidentally. I just smirked, which earned another growl before she grabbed my hand, prepared to drag me to the meeting. </p><p>I was really liking her new expressive personality.</p><p>So much that, I wanted to have another taste of her deliciousness before we go to the meeting. A gasp escaped when I pushed her against the wall, her chest pressing against the wall, with only her robe to protect her. Before she could even realize what was going on, I pulled her robe above her hips, revealing her delicious nakedness, unable to be covered by the ruins of her skirt. “W-what are you doing,” she stammered in shock, just as my fingers caressed her wetness. </p><p>“Helping you to wake up properly before the meeting,” I whispered even as I pressed my shaft against her entrance, easily slipping into her familiar wetness.</p><p>She failed to come up with an answer to my brazen statement as I started pumping inside her, in an open area where anyone could walk in. It was very unlikely for anyone to sneak up to me even when I wasn’t paying attention of course, but that didn’t prevent her from panicking. I slipped deeper inside while she tried to get a handle of the situation, enjoying her wetness.</p><p>[+500 Experience]</p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 62%]</p><p>She managed to suppress her moans by biting her lips even as she abandoned herself to my grasp, enjoying the assault. Though, a minute later, she managed to ask a question. “Why I’m not recovering any mana?” she murmured dazedly. </p><p>“Because I’m not giving you any,” I answered even as I grabbed her ass tighter, slamming my hips even harder against hers, loud enough to necessitate a quick silencing ward. </p><p>“But…” she gasped in shock. “Why are we doing it then?” </p><p>I leaned for a quick kiss before I pulled back, keeping my gaze on her beautiful gray eyes. “Because I want to fuck you,” I answered directly. </p><p>The blush that spread on her face was simply spectacular. The fact that I was enjoying sex with her was not a surprise, nor I was the only one that was enjoying it. We had done the naked dance enough to remove any kind of mystery about that. Still, the excuse of mana transfer always stood in between her and the honest acknowledgment of her transformation, however flimsy. </p><p>Then, just after such a momentous battle, and before a critical meeting, I pulled the pretense down, forcing her to acknowledge the truth. And from the way she tightened and her hips quickened, I could see that she accepted the truth exactly the same way I hoped she would… </p><p>The realization, combined with her growing arousal, hit her strong, and soon, she was tightening around my body, her subtle moans mixing with mine. </p><p>[+900 Experience]</p><p>[Companion Acquisition: Progress 69%]</p><p>I would have loved to pump her until I stained her insides once more, but pity that we had an important meeting, and she needed to be nominally presentable. I pulled out of her, and she collapsed on the floor for a minute, trying to catch her breath under my amused glare. </p><p>“Shut up,” she murmured with a cute blush as she conjured another mirror, and fixed her appearance before grabbing my hand once more to drag me to the meeting. I allowed her to do so, even though messing with her more sounded really tempting.</p><p>But as we climbed up the stairs of the tower, I replaced that smile with a calm yet hard-to-read expression, which, counter-intuitively, would have made her focus me more. This time, however, I wasn’t as afraid of her probes, because I had the time to construct a more robust soul space for her to probe, with just enough extra power to convincingly sell our adventure, and the achievement of taking down five Death Knights and a big chunk out of the undead army —thanks to the explosion of the latest trap.</p><p>Titania squeezed my hand for one last time before she knocked on the door, and we walked inside. </p><p>Once again, the first thing I noticed as we walked inside was the aura of darkness that was thick enough to slam my face. Thick, viscous darkness that almost throbbed threateningly, promising to engulf everything. Despite expecting it, my instincts cried in alarm, the hair on the back of my head standing out. All the while, the headmistress sat on her chair behind her intimidatingly large desk, her cloaked and hunched figure almost a silhouette with just one small crystal glow to brighten the room. </p><p>She was giving the impression of an evil witch perfectly. Too perfectly, even… </p><p>I had to admit, it was an excellent setup, so much that, along with her intimidation factor — both in terms of power, and the suspicious lack of skill improvement next to her— it would have tricked me if it wasn’t for Titania’s slip about the light magic and my own discoveries about the feel of her mana when she tried to probe me. However, looking with a new perspective, I could finally see the seams of her trick, like watching a street illusionist for the second time after learning how the trick worked. </p><p>“You look exhausted,” the headmistress said to Titania, which triggered a lengthy explanation from her, including how we traveled, the battle tricks, and the intimating presence of the lich and the Death Knights. Most noticeably, however, she neglected to mention the little detail of mana transfer, with all the tricks it implied. It was endearingly cute to watch her gloss over such a critical piece of information just because she felt ashamed. </p><p>Her lengthy explanation gave me the excuse to analyze the suffocating aura of darkness in a more detailed manner. I appreciated the extra time, because it took almost five minutes for me to acclimatize myself to the darkness thick enough to choke my senses despite my overwhelming abilities. </p><p>The first thing I was able to definitely prove about the aura was the uniformity of it. Despite its strength and the implied chaos of the darkness, the pressure itself was smooth, suspiciously so, like amber frozen around a flower, preserving it to eternity. Such a juxtaposition between concepts would have been enough to awaken my curiosity if I wasn’t already alert due to the significance of the headmistress on my safety. </p><p>So, I delved deeper, to understand the reason for that smoothness. It took another couple of minutes for me to identify the source of the darkness. To my surprise, it confirmed my assumptions in a definite way I wasn’t expecting. </p><p>The darkness was radiating from the ward that surrounded the room itself!</p><p>I could barely keep myself from exclaiming in shock as I realized that particular fact. The darkness didn’t come from the headmistress, but the room itself. Combined with her dangerously-capable abilities in light magic if I were to take Titania’s sleepy comment about light magic as an accurate assessment, it likely meant that the aura of the room ran contrary to her nature. </p><p>Unfortunately, there were too many possibilities for me to deduce, so, when Titania’s explanation finally reached the Death Knights —which distracted the headmistress significantly— I finally had the courage to extend a tendril of mana toward her, just a lingering touch, nothing more. Risky, but no risk, no reward. And even if she detected my intrusion, what she was going to do, kill me on the eve of a dangerous assault, where I might prove critical to save her school. </p><p>The tendril of mana tried to slip underneath her robe, however, only to be absorbed immediately, giving me just a glimpse before disappearing. But even that glimpse was confusing enough, because I received two different sensations at the same time. The first felt like an endless sea of light, reminding me of Titania’s Acolyte core, but only purer, and spread around rather than collected as a core, therefore less intense. </p><p>The second was a raging piece of darkness, strong and pulsating, for some reason, giving me a sensation of a rabid animal, locked behind iron doors, but slamming repeatedly in search of freedom. Whatever it was, it wasn’t good news, so much that I was glad my intrusion went unnoticed. </p><p>She was not a creature of darkness, with some interesting selection of lighter magic. No, on the opposite, she was a creature of light, but for reason, carried a mark of darkness. The question, whether that mark was intentional, or something that she was forced to carry. </p><p>As a result, I looked at the hunched figure of the headmistress, hidden under her magically-insulating cloak, with even more questions. She was even more mysterious than the rare stories about her implied —though the fact that the stories about her were rare in the first place while she led one of the most premier institutions in the world kind of reinforced the point. I was starting to believe that the whole point of having that ward was to hide her presence. Of course, that raised two more questions. </p><p>Why she was trying to hide? </p><p>And more importantly, who, or what, she was trying to hide from?</p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 30    Experience: 441000 / 465000 </p><p>Strength: 36    Charisma: 51</p><p>Precision: 33    Perception: 35</p><p>Agility: 33     Manipulation: 38</p><p>Speed: 32       Intelligence: 42</p><p>Endurance: 30      Wisdom: 44</p><p>HP: 4920 / 4920\tMana: 6300 / 6300        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Master Subterfuge [97/100]         </p><p>Master Arcana [90/100]        </p><p>Expert Speech [66/75]</p><p>Advanced Craft [31/50]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 17/25] </p><p>[Helga - Level 13/17] </p>",
