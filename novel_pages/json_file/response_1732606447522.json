    "content": "<p>The moment we landed, the monsters gathered around us like moths to the flame. Then, Maria took action, turning that into a rather unfortunate pun. </p><p>While she fought, I tried to feel the mana around us, but I failed. I had managed to feel the presence of mana when I had been working, but that was only through a combination of two of my skills. Without activating them, I couldn’t sense the mana around me. </p><p>I wondered if it would have been different if I spent my time practicing yoga — or other activities that I wrote off as nonsense — instead of working on science, but I didn’t really care about it. Too bad I couldn’t just get a skill like Meditation without corresponding Stats.</p><p>However, even as I moved the first wounded monster, I wondered if I could cheat. Luckily, I had my multipurpose hammer with me along with the Warhammer. I looked toward Maria, and saw that she was busy with the next wave of monsters. </p><p>It was the best time to experiment. I pulled my multipurpose hammer, and tapped against the surface of my armor, doing my best to activate my Mana Manipulation perk. </p><p>As I did that, the head of the hammer worked like a magnet, some mana gathered to its head. I maintained my focus even as I smashed it against the wounded monster. It dispersed before I could kill the monster. </p><p>“No matter,” I muttered as I moved to the next wounded creature, repeating the trick again and again. My increased Strength allowed me to kill them with much more ease, though my faithful hammer was struggling under the blows. </p><p>Success, however, was fleeting. I was familiar with switching between the effects of the two skills. I had pulled that trick between Forge and Repair many times. Unfortunately, back then, I was pulling that trick between swings, just as a way to check the designs. </p><p>Now, I was trying to maintain the mana around the hammer, which was significantly more challenging. Switch too soon, and the mana dispersed. Switch too late, and the System didn’t register it as use of Hammer of Might. </p><p>Worse, I was under a time crunch. The first wave of the monsters was the most dangerous one. Distracted by it, she wouldn’t notice my trick with the hammer, but it wouldn’t be true once the number of attacking monsters dropped to a manageable level. </p><p>Just as I was fearing I would have to stop before I could finish my experiments, I managed to switch just in time. The monster died under the blow, and a notification appeared. </p><p>[Hammer of Might (Uncommon) 7 -&gt; 13]</p><p>Success. Well, technically, partial success, as the skill didn’t suddenly turn into a mana variant, but it was one of the reasonable results. The external skills and the class skills were different, so the lack of an upgrade was understandable. </p><p>It meant the best-case scenario was out, but that didn’t make the experiment useless. Not only did it confirm the viability of the skill upgrade method for other skills, but also gave me a chance to upgrade my sole combat skill far faster. </p><p>Ordinarily, improving combat skills faster was required to fight against more dangerous monsters, just like how repairing more valuable weapons improved repair faster. However, it had certain limits, particularly for someone like me with little experience in combat. After all, killing a wounded beast in one blow didn’t improve it as much as a deadly fight where one pushed oneself to the limit. </p><p>The jump of six skill levels for one blow, when the target was lying helplessly, was incredible enough. It meant I had a rapid way of increasing my combat skills, which mattered a lot. I might not like fighting, but it was far better to be good and not need it. </p><p>The post-Cataclysm world was filled with dangers by default. Having a better skill was certainly worth it. Every point mattered, particularly for an uncommon skill, which was harder to improve. Improving six points by one blow was incredible. </p><p>While Maria was distracted, I killed fifty monsters with mana blows successfully, though I attempted many more. Technically, I could push my luck more, but factoring in diminishing returns and increasing risk of getting caught, I decided against it. </p><p>The rewards were rather fascinating. </p><p>[Level 22 -&gt; 23]</p><p>[+2 Vitality, +2 Strength,, +1 Dexterity]</p><p>[Hammer of Might (Uncommon) 13 -&gt; 53]</p><p>As much as confirming that external skills not granting any perk even at proficiency level fifty was a bummer, I was very happy with the gains. With an uncommon fighting skill at level fifty, I was actually qualified as a decent fighter, the kind that the expedition groups would try to hire rather than me trying to join them. Combined with my improving Strength, I was actually confident of defeating the monsters that were attacking us. </p><p>Well, one by one, with breaks in between. If I dared to come to a location like this without Maria’s assistance, I would have been shredded into pieces easily. </p><p>Ignoring the dreams of enacting the life of Conan the Barbarian, I shifted back to using the Warhammer, and started demolishing the immobile monsters. Not an epic tale of cutting through the wilderness, but the steady effort of a workman, smashing again and again. </p><p>“How is it going?” Maria asked, walking near me once she had walked near me. I felt a sense of mana invading my body, one that disappeared just as quickly. “Level twenty-three, very good,” she said. </p><p> I realized two things in quick succession. Her identification spell didn’t work on skills, just levels, or she would have reacted in a much more extreme manner. And…</p><p>I had just experienced a very close call, one of neglect. I never faced it, but it was not impossible for the others to have skills or spells that could see through not only the level but the other details. </p><p>“A quick question. How does your identify work?” I asked. </p><p>“Nothing too fancy,” she replied. “It just shows the level of the target, and nothing else. Unfortunately, a basic one has its limits.” </p><p>“Really. Are they even harder to find than Production skills,” I asked, always happy to learn more. </p><p>“Basic ones are, but the better versions are much easier to find,” she replied. </p><p>“Really?” I asked. “That doesn’t make sense.” </p><p>“It does when you factor in the requirements,” she said. “The basic one only requires Essence stat, but the common one needs both Essence and Perception. Not exactly a common combination,” she replied. </p><p>I nodded, feeling slightly more relaxed. It meant that I wasn’t facing the risk of revealing all my secrets immediately. Especially since it was rude to use Identify on people — something I learned from Eleanor’s reaction — so it shouldn’t be too big of a risk. </p><p>Still, I made a note not to walk around in the camp. The last thing I needed was to get caught by a spy. </p><p>“Inconvenient,” I muttered. </p><p>“So, are you ready to pass the threshold,” she asked. </p><p>“Frankly, no. I don’t even know what I need to do.” </p><p>“First, you need to prepare yourself for a horrible pain,” she said. </p><p>“Oh, really?” I asked, chuckling. She wasn’t a good liar. </p><p>“Yes, when the mana hits, it feels like fire going through your veins. It’s the kind of torture you can’t imagine,” she said. I gasped in fear, acting like I believed her. She started giggling. “Don’t worry. You don’t need to do anything. It’s like getting a new perk. Once it hits, you get a choice.” </p><p>“Even if I have only one option,” I asked. </p><p>“Yes. It’s probably a safety measure. Once you trigger it, you start absorbing mana from the environment immediately, which can trigger the approach of monsters. Worse, you can trigger it in the middle of a mana-dead environment. It wouldn’t be pleasant.” </p><p>“Is it safe to do it here? Should we go back to a town?” </p><p>She chuckled. “Don’t worry. With me defending you, there’s no risk,” she guaranteed. “Do you think there’s a monster in a ten-mile radius that can threaten me?” </p><p>“No, you’re amazing,” I said, enjoying the way she blushed. For a rude young woman, she was certainly weak to compliments. </p><p>“I … shut up and continue working. That’s enough for a break.” </p><p>“As you wish, my lady,” I said, giving an exaggerated bow. She blushed even more. Now that she warmed up to me, she was easy to tease. </p><p>[Level 23 -&gt; 24]</p><p>[+2 Vitality, +2 Strength,, +1 Dexterity]</p><p>“Another level,” I called, after another fifteen minutes of steady monster killing. Working in a more dangerous location was paying dividends. Another twenty minutes later, another notification arrived. This time with </p><p>[Level 24 -&gt; 25]</p><p>[+2 Vitality, +2 Strength,, +1 Dexterity]</p><p>[Class Upgrade: Blacksmith / Mana Mender / Mana Crafter / Mana Blacksmith]</p><p>“Well, that’s a surprise,” I muttered, once again cursing the necessity of a blind choice. Once again, I was making a choice with little information, solely based on the impressiveness of the name. </p><p>Mana Mender felt like a name for a class that focused on repair work. Carrying the indicator of Mana made it seem more impressive, but it was still enough to be eliminated. </p><p>Mana Crafter felt like a better option, but the existence of the mender, implied that it would focus on the production side. More tempting than turning into a repair expert. The ability to mass produce weapons would have ensured a living for me without revealing myself. </p><p>However, ultimately, I chose Mana Blacksmith. The only reason I was able to discover the secrets of the skill upgrade was to play around with the two skills, combining the information they offered. Choosing to prioritize one seemed like a bad idea. </p><p>Especially when level fifty didn’t seem too far away. </p><p>As I chose, another notification appeared in front of me. </p><p>[Class upgrade - 01%]</p><p>I wasn’t able to feel the movement of mana around me, but it must have been intense, as I could actually feel the air reacting with it, slowly circling me. Monsters at a distance started to move more vigorously, only to fall to Maria’s flames. </p><p>She even maintained enough control to leave them wounded. </p><p>“No need to stand still, go kill them,” she said. “It’ll make the process go faster.” </p><p>“I much rather try to feel what’s going on with my body,” I said. “It’s fascinating.” </p><p>“Sure, but it’ll last longer,” she warned. I ignored her as I closed my eyes, feeling the mana flow to me. I might not feel it outside my body, but it was a subtle stirring feeling once it reached my body. Merely a tickle and nothing more. </p><p>I decided to follow her suggestion and start killing monsters. Mostly because I didn’t want to make her suspicious. What if better classes required more time to change. By killing monsters, I could muddy that number more. </p><p>By killing monsters, it took ten minutes for class change to complete, and I was barely able to generate an impression of the process. A lost opportunity, but not enough to ruin my mood. </p><p>Not with my new class abilities in front of me. </p><p>[Mana Blacksmith - Level 25]</p><p>[Health 660/750] [Mana 0/120]</p><p>[Vitality 50 / Strength 50 / Dexterity 37 / Essence 13]</p><p>[Skills (4/9)</p><p>Mana Repair (Rare) - 25 [Inspect]</p><p>Mana Forge (Rare) - 25 [Intuitive Forging, Mana Manipulation]</p><p>Meditation (Common) - 1</p><p>Hammer of Might (Uncommon) - 53]</p>",

    "content": "<p>My dreams of sleeping until noon had been ruined by a sudden stirring. Panicked, I opened my eyes, only to see Eleanor looking at me with a sharp expression. “Explain!” she ordered. </p><p>I froze. I didn’t expect to be discovered, not after spending the whole night cleaning. Could it be that Maria had revealed something and Eleanor managed to connect the dots. </p><p>One good thing about being forcibly woken up by a scary woman with an even scarier aura that felt like a sword, my exhaustion had dispersed quite easily, my mind working overclocking in panic. The first question was what exactly she knew. </p><p>I had many secrets. Some mild, like the fact that my Forge skill had a perk it shouldn’t have, and some significantly more radical, like my Forge skill, wasn’t just Forge anymore. Answering the wrong question would only the problem more troubling. </p><p>I decided to pick the safest option first. “I’m sorry. I have used more bronze ingots than we had agreed upon, but Lady Maria said that —” </p><p>“I’m not talking about it,” she growled, her aura tightening further. I knew she wasn’t talking about it, but the challenge was to know what she was talking about. “Tell me, what are your intentions towards her?” </p><p>This time, I didn’t need to fake my expression of shock. I truly didn’t understand what she was trying to say. “Is this about wasting her time by asking her help?” I probed, confused. </p><p>She said nothing, examining my expression. I had no idea what she was looking for, but she must have found it because her aura receded once more. “Good, you know your place,” she said. </p><p>“Of course, ma’am,” I replied, a hint of military respect feeling appropriate. I didn’t know what it was, but nodding in acceptance seemed like a safe bet. </p><p>“Good. Now, prepare. You’ll be leaving with Maria soon. No funny business. Understand?” </p><p>With that, she left as sharply as she left. Her sudden intrusion into my living space was annoying, but the camp was similar to a military operation. And, there was no privacy in the military. Especially when I was the weaker party. </p><p>I quickly donned my armor and took my helmet. “Fascinating,” I muttered as I touched them, enjoying the wave of new information provided by Mana Repair, allowing me to enjoy the intricacies of the products even more. Multiple enchantments overlapped, creating a confusing outlay, one that I doubted that I could handle even with my current abilities. But, if I could find a workaround — </p><p>I stopped that line of thought. As much as the idea of playing around with them was fun, I couldn’t afford it. Unlike the swords I brought to repair, my new armor and hammer were not disposable assets. Damaging them would attract undue notice. </p><p>And, even if I was willing, I didn’t have time. </p><p>“Ready for another day of adventure,” Maria greeted me cheerfully. </p><p>“Always,” I replied, this time, not even faking excitement. I was looking forward to clearing the first threshold, curious what I would find. Not to mention, I had many questions that needed to be answered, and Maria was the best candidate. She was strong and came from a strong family, which meant she knew far more secrets than I did. Combined with her careless approach to secrets — at least minor ones that didn’t matter to her — she was the best target to question. </p><p>I had thought about asking Eleanor, but erratic behavior this morning changed my mind. </p><p>For the first part of the flight, we played chess. Maria crushed me even harder than usual, though I was happy. Between moves, I managed to wheedle some stories from her. Mostly stories of previous battles, mostly about how she singlehandedly managed to save the day. </p><p>She was clearly bragging, but that didn’t make her stories untrue. I had seen her destroy thousands of monsters without breaking a sweat. I couldn’t even imagine just how impressive she was when she actually faced a threat requiring her to push herself. </p><p>“ … And then, I created a wall of fire, enveloping the monsters as I hit from the side, saving the elites of the guild from certain destruction,” she finished another story. </p><p>“Wow, fascinating,” I said. “You must have been really proud. I wish that I could fight just as well, saving people rather than … being a worker.” That was so far from my true sentiments that it wasn’t even funny. While I envied the benefits of the stats granted to others, the last thing I wanted was to spend my day on the battlefield, risking myself every day. </p><p>I much rather stay in my forge and tinker. It was not a replacement for a proper research project, but it was far better than going around fighting like another grunt. The world had enough of them already. </p><p>“If only I could change my class,” I baited. Faking sorrow wasn’t too hard. I just focused on the fact that I was thousands of feet above the ground, and started shaking. </p><p>Maria noticed my distress as she shifted in her seat, hugged me, and patted my back. A surprisingly kind move from her, which made me feel guilty about manipulating her. Still, I was already committed. </p><p>“Too bad the class promotion is not triggered by external skills. You would have made an excellent warrior with your determination,” she said, revealing a piece of information that I had been searching for. </p><p>“Yeah, it’s a pity that it only works with class skills,” I said, acting like it was something I knew all along. “Worse, it’s impossible to get skills for Production classes.” </p><p>“Not impossible, but very difficult,” she responded. “There had been one auction for Uncommon skill, though ultimately we weren’t able to afford it.” </p><p>“You couldn’t afford it?” I asked, shocked. </p><p>She blushed. “Well, only because this operation is … well, complicated. Our budget is limited, so ultimately, we decided an Uncommon Repair skill was not worth paying for.” </p><p>“May I ask how much it went for?” </p><p>“Two hundred platinum coins,” she replied, which shocked me. A platinum coin was worth a hundred gold coins, making that skill worth twenty thousand gold. I thought myself rich just because I had fifty gold coins. </p><p>The new economy didn’t make sense. Though, it was inevitable when money was generated by killing monsters, and used in mysterious shops with even more mysterious goods. </p><p>“Are all uncommon skills that expensive?” I asked. </p><p>She snorted. “Not even close. My own Rare meditation skill had merely cost four platinum coins. It’s just the rarity driving up the price. It’s just some groups trying to find a way to trigger upgrades for production classes. It’s a waste of effort.” </p><p>“Why?” I asked. </p><p>“Because a rare skill is a minimum requirement to trigger a class upgrade,” she said. “People worked very hard to trigger class upgrades for production classes during the first days of Calamity. </p><p>“Before we discovered the System Shops,” I completed. </p><p>“Exactly. With the shops in place, the production classes are pretty much useless —” she started, only to freeze. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean it like that!” </p><p>“Don’t worry about it. I can’t blame you for telling the truth,” I said, once again looking despondent. But, I was very happy with her unintentional insult. It meant that she would be looking for an opportunity to change the topic. “Too bad we can’t upgrade the skills ourselves, right?” I asked. </p><p>“Yeah, it would have been nice not to depend on dungeon drops for rare skills, not to mention anything higher,” she muttered in frustration. “You can’t believe how long I had stayed in a dungeon just to get my epic skill.” </p><p>“I’m sure there’s a good story there,” I responded, changing the topic once more. Her words already confirmed to me what I needed to know. I could ask further, but I rather not look too curious. </p><p>I had already received my most important answer. Rare production skills were either unheard of or their existence was suppressed. </p><p>I didn’t know which. There was a possibility that I was the only one that achieved it in the whole world. If I said that to someone else, they would certainly feel like it was arrogance. However, I couldn’t discount the possibility due to a combination of several unique factors. </p><p>First, the fact that I was a genius was an undisputed fact. Otherwise, I couldn’t have been one of the leading figures in my field before my peers could even finish their education. </p><p>Then, there were the three years I spent constantly working as a Blacksmith, which gave me some unique insights that proved very useful, in the experience proved useful. </p><p>In addition, I had been lucky. Extremely so. If Maria hadn’t been a fire mage, if I wasn’t working in a location without environment mana to interfere, the experiment would have failed. </p><p>Yet, the biggest differentiator was a difference in belief. Everyone was fascinated by the benefits of the System, too ready to discard the learnings of the past. Maybe it was because the technology had failed us, they believed the science did as well. </p><p>A mistake. Technology was just a tool. If it was broken, just develop a new one. Science, on the other hand, was a way to dissect and understand the world. It helped our ancestors to understand the mysteries of thunder and the seas. </p><p>I had no reason to believe it couldn’t do the same for the System. </p><p>But, ironically, my discovery had given me a reason to keep my head down. Science lets us understand the world, but it didn’t always end well for the scientist in question. Galileo had been almost burned at the stake, and Giordano Bruno had actually been burned. Many other scientists had been killed, ostracized, or otherwise ruined for revealing the truth. </p><p>Particularly if that truth affected the established economic benefits. </p><p>No, as much as I wanted to reveal the truth, I didn’t dare to. </p><p>“Amazing. Then what,” I muttered, not paying attention to Maria’s story other than knowing when to nod and encourage — an ability I perfected in endless department meetings — while I charted the next stage of my strategy. </p><p>“Then, we gathered together and …” she said, then paused. “Too bad we have to stop. We have reached our destination,” she asked. </p><p>“Of course,” I said, then looked around, and realized it wasn’t the same location. “We’re not at the same place, right?” I asked. </p><p>“No,” she replied. “Since you are already in level twenties, I decided that we can handle a more dangerous location.” </p><p>“Whatever you say. You’re the expert,” I said. I wasn’t entirely happy with it, but trying to argue against was pointless considering she didn’t even ask my opinion in the first place. </p><p>I twirled my hammer. It was the time to fight. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I couldn’t help but frown as I twirled my hammer thoughtfully. The changes in my Forge skill were fascinating. </p><p>[Mana Forge (Rare) - 10 [Intuitive Forging]]</p><p>Too bad it had come with some interesting but potentially dangerous implications. How dangerous, I had no idea, mostly because I didn’t know what was common knowledge among the elites, what was known but kept as a secret for strategic reasons, and what was genuinely secret. </p><p>I was glad that Eleanor’s awkward yet pointless intervention had been timely enough to give me a chance to come up with an explanation, bending the truth as necessary. </p><p>The first fact was the rank of the skill. The existence of the rare skills wasn’t unknown, but every time I heard about them, they had been in the context of external skills, and exclusively on combat skills. That was true for basic and common, and especially true for uncommon skills. </p><p>There was a reason why Eleanor was able to give me that skill almost without thinking, yet failed to get even one Uncommon skill for their Blacksmiths despite their urgent need. </p><p>Production skills were hard to come by. </p><p>And, now, I have a Rare production skill. It would have been dangerous enough if it was an external skill. But, it was a class skill. </p><p>It was common knowledge that a common class skill was better than an external uncommon skill despite the latter granting more knowledge, for one simple reason. Class skills granted perks, while external skills did not. </p><p>This was why every warrior was obsessed with getting an improved version of their skill, improving their rarity without losing their perks. </p><p>I was aware that I didn’t know everything — a fact that was getting more and more clear with every passing day. Maybe external skills could grant Perks but require higher proficiency. Not many people focussed on improving their external skills. I was familiar with a few people with production classes who decided to focus on combat, and brought their external combat skills to forties without receiving a perk, but it was hardly conclusive evidence.</p><p>But, even if that was true and external skills started to get perks starting from fifty, it would give my Rare skill two additional Perks, making it far more valuable than another skill. </p><p>And, in addition to all of those factors, my new skill allowed me to create mana-based alloys, which could be strategically very relevant even if the System Shop had been selling cheaply. And, even if it was not, it was still valuable. </p><p>“Damn, what a complicated mess,” I growled. I should be feeling pure happiness rather than frustration. What happened with my skill was potentially dangerous for too many reasons. I decided to keep it a secret until I could interrogate Maria more about the skills. That way, even if she didn’t reveal strategic secrets, she would reveal what was common knowledge. </p><p>“But, that’s enough gloom,” I said as I slapped my cheek. “Let’s see what this new skill can do.” </p><p>I tapped into that skill by melting an ingot of ordinary metal, which offered me multiple recipes instinctively. Methods that only only included the required materials but also methods. </p><p>The first thing I realized was just how lucky I had been. My crazy weird method apparently only worked because there was no environmental mana to interact with it what Maria had infused the flames. The same technique would have failed if we were in a less hostile location.</p><p>Was that a lucky coincidence? Certainly, but I wasn’t the first scientist or inventor who was lucky. Many products, from penicillin to rubber, had been discovered by accident. </p><p>Luckily, the skill had included many methods to actually use the environment mana during forging, meaning I wouldn’t need to beg Maria in the hope of improving. It also meant that, as long as I was in the camp, I couldn’t do any mana forging, which was a bummer. </p><p>I wanted to play with my new toy. </p><p>”Patience,” I muttered even as I repeated the same treatment for other base metals. I had discovered about a dozen different mana ingots, mostly copper and bronze, each designed for a specific type. The variant that was used for the swords was absent, and so was any iron-based recipe. </p><p>Clearly, my skill level was not high enough. </p><p>A problem that I could hopefully solve without mana. It would be very frustrating if it only improved by forging mana ingots from scratch. </p><p>Just to be comprehensive, I started by forging ordinary metal daggers. Naturally, there was no response. I spend my next three hours forging the standard dungeon-based ingots and using them to forge various small weapons. </p><p>My patience didn’t go without a reward. </p><p>[Mana Forge (Rare) - 10 -&gt; 11]</p><p>“Excellent,” I said even as I stopped using them. Ultimately, the aim of that exercise was to understand whether ordinary materials could improve the skill, or whether mana alloys were a necessity. Confirming that it was not, I happily reached for another bronze ingot and turned it into a dagger, though I still repeatedly touched the swords to give me direction. </p><p>This time, the forging process lasted much longer, more than an hour. However, I was more than happy ‘wasting’ time, because the resulting dagger was a fascinating work. </p><p>[Mana Forge (Rare) - 11 -&gt; 16]</p><p>“A fascinating jump,” I muttered as I paused, processing the new recipes I had received, the number of available recipes increasing. “Should I delay or continue?” </p><p>For once, I didn’t care about wasting ingots. I had already wasted more than the allocated amount, but Maria’s involvement gave me a good excuse for how much I had used. After all, wasting a few extra ingots was better than wasting Maria’s day. At least, that should be convincing for Eleanor. </p><p>I stopped for a simpler reason. That, whether delaying reaching the next threshold would be a good choice. My previous success with Intuitive Forging suggested that the activities leading to the improvement impacted the perks, and the surprise improvement of the skill further confirmed it. </p><p>But, after considering it for some time, I decided against it. There were still perks at level fifty to consider if I wanted to modify it. Also, I had no idea what kind of perks it would offer in the first place, making it an even more complicated affair. </p><p>Then, I froze. The skills could change, and the perks at the thresholds could change. But then, what about the classes. Is there a way to change it? Improve it, maybe? </p><p>A wild assumption that was supported by nothing, but not impossible. And, if it was true, I would learn it tomorrow when Maria escorted me to another leveling trip — unless Eleanor had her way. </p><p>“I hate testing theories on myself,” I said, but my frustration was rather meek. If my theory was wrong, it wouldn’t matter. I would continue being a Blacksmith. But, if correct … I didn’t even want to imagine. </p><p>Six more daggers later, I received the notification I had been looking for. </p><p>[Mana Forge (Rare) - 16 -&gt; 25]</p><p>[Perk Options — Modify / Masterwork / Mana Manipulation] </p><p>“What an annoying reward,” I muttered. I had no idea what Modify meant, and while I knew what Masterwork was, I didn’t need it. Mana Manipulation was the best choice under the circumstances. </p><p>I wasn’t particularly worried. If worst came to worst and the perk turned out to be useless, I could always use the Perk Reset stone directly. The price of three gold, which had been hovering over me like an executioner’s blade, didn’t even register. </p><p>“How quickly things could change,” I muttered, though I couldn’t feel help melancholic about it. All the benefits were also a warning. Things could improve … but also turn into disaster.</p><p>“Now, to try the next part,” I muttered and turned my attention to the available sources of mana. The ingots, and the daggers. After a momentary thought, I first turned my attention to the leftover ingots that I had destroyed during my experiments with Maria. They were already mostly useless, meaning I could play with them with ease. </p><p>A few smashes later, I once again breached the mana they contained. However, unlike the previous time, the mana had stuck to my hammer, following it. It was a small, instinctive thing. Next to nothing. </p><p>But, next to nothing was far better than nothing. </p><p>“Let’s see if I can double-dip on the same trick,” I muttered as I brought one of the daggers I had just forged, and started destroying a small section of it. When it was just a deformation, the structure could be repaired by ordinary methods. However, once the mana it had contained leaked, the suggestion of the skill had changed, needing new material to replace the section. </p><p>A suggestion I ignored. Instead, I started steadily demolishing another dagger, trying to use the mana from it to essentially reforge that tiny section with my mana. It had been a slow, wasteful process. Not only I had destroyed five daggers, but also wasted two more fresh ingots in the process. </p><p>Certainly a terrible method to use in a mana-dead location like the camp, but I didn’t care about it. </p><p>All I cared about was the notification that had appeared in front of me. </p><p>[Repair (Common) - 36 -&gt; Mana Repair (Rare) - 25]</p><p>“Success,” I said. The poetic thing would have been to throw myself into the bed with a happy smile. Instead, I scoured the forge, removing every sign of my successful experimentation. No need to ruin everything due to a bout of carelessness. I didn’t worry about oversleeping. Since my leaving trip with Maria had been most likely canceled, I had a rare chance to spend a morning in bed. </p><p>Too bad I didn’t have a nice cup of coffee to enjoy once I woke up. Sometimes, the loss of the small comforts hurt the worst. </p><p>Dreaming of a steaming cup, I continued to work. In the end, I barely managed to drag myself to my bed, but as I slept, I was happier than I ever remembered being since the Cataclysm… </p><p>I missed the sweet taste of success… </p>",

    "content": "<p>“… Nothing yet?” Maria asked even as I went through my notes. </p><p>I sighed. I could see that she was getting bored. While she had been interested in my lesson at first, as we reached the four-hour mark, she was getting bored. I couldn’t exactly blame her, not when her function was between a forge and a spreadsheet to make some incredibly boring calculations. </p><p>That meant, I needed to entertain her. Playing chess to help her pass the time would have been a nice option, as she was still entertained by demolishing me, but I couldn’t exactly split my attention between my experiment and playing chess. </p><p>It was already stretching my abilities to the limit. </p><p>I paused a moment to compose an answer, one that I would give to a donor asking for another grant despite the failure of a previous experiment. And, the best way to do that was to massage even the most basic result into something fascinating. “We have already made incredible progress,” I said. </p><p>“We did?” she asked, surprised. I didn’t blame her. </p><p>“Of course we did,” I said as I quickly scribbled some notes, which was essentially the summary of what we did, put in fancier terms. .”Look, we already have a good sense of how base metals behave. Copper holds mana longer, but has a lower capacity. Meanwhile, iron almost acts like a semiconductor when mana is concerned. Pewter helps to stabilize mana flow, while aluminum reflects. Those are critical information that hadn’t been known.” </p><p>“Really?” she said. “The numbers weren’t that different, none of them were able to hold mana longer than half a minute. Most of them were completely inert even before cooling down.” </p><p>“You’re looking at it the wrong way. We already know that various metals react differently. The reason, we don’t know yet, but we can start working on identifying it once the books on metallurgy arrive. It has to be something about their physical structure. The interaction between macro structures and atomic crystallization is promising ...” I said, and from there, I spun a rather lengthy explanation about how mana might interact with the material. </p><p>Some of that lecture was grounded on my observations about enchantments and weapons, but most of it was wild theories that sounded impressive but had no basis. </p><p>“I see,” Maria said, once again too proud to admit she lacked the context for the half of my explanation. It was mean, but when facing the opportunity to experiment even more, I couldn’t refuse the chance. “Let’s continue. What’s the next step? Are we going to continue with testing metals?” </p><p>Ideally, I would have continued to test the metals, at least for a month, maybe more. Even without the possibility of a lucky discovery at a certain point of mana density or cooling pattern, having a wider range of materials to test would have been incredibly beneficial. </p><p>Unfortunately, I had a feeling if I told that, her interest would evaporate immediately. I couldn’t forget the fact that while it was a very important experiment for me, it was nothing more than a way to pass the time for her. If we still had TV, she wouldn’t have been here. </p><p>“Of course not. Now, we’re going to see how the alloys given to me by the dungeon products would work in holding mana,” I said, curious about the implications. “We’ll start with some of the common material and work our way up.” </p><p>“Are we going to do it for different sizes of coins?” she asked. </p><p>I wanted to, but once again, time constraints forced me to take some shortcuts I didn’t like. And, I much rather have a wide range of materials first before the dungeon products. “No, the earlier experimentation already gave us a good baseline for how the size affects the process. While there’s a chance for some unexpected interactions depending on the size, it’s better we work on a standard size first.” </p><p>With that, I started another set of experiments, creating hundreds of coins, each mixed with various dungeon parts based on the recipes provided by the Forge skill. </p><p>All failed, spectacularly, and obviously even without running any kind of statistical analysis. They functioned worse than ordinary metals. I thought about telling Maria that, but, at the last second, a glance at the pile of swords changed my mind. </p><p>Why not try to use it as some kind of sample. I grabbed a fresh ingot, and started smashing it with the express purpose of ruining it, every blow changing its structure. </p><p>With Inspect, I kept a careful note of every single change, trying to understand what had been going on with the process as I destroyed it slowly, section by section, stretching my Inspect to the limit as I tried to memorize the structures that let out of the mana, and comparing with the results of the other experiments as far as I remember. </p><p>Not exactly an easy job, even with all the guidance from the skill. I was once again fumbling in an area that I knew very little about, my three years of practice as a Blacksmith were not as useful as the few fragmented journals I was able to get. </p><p>I would pay a lot for a complete introductory book on metallurgy. Unfortunately, considering all the books I had came from ruins of the libraries, I wasn’t exactly teeming with options. Hopefully, it’ll be more helpful. </p><p>I had destroyed five more valuable ingots before I had managed to develop a decent idea of what was going on, not helped by the very complicated structure of the alloy. It wasn’t uniform, filled with many different internal patterns, including orbs, hexagons, and diamond-like structures. </p><p>But, as I destroyed them repeatedly, I realized that the mana was exclusively held in the hexagon structures. Why, I had no idea. Maybe it was something about the shape, or maybe it was about the inoculation material it required to trap mana. </p><p>“We have a direction to experiment,” I declared, a little more confident than I was doing. </p><p>“Really, that’s good,” she said excitedly. “Do I need to put any mana?” </p><p>“Not yet,” I said. “Actually, you can even take a dinner break while I experiment on the structure.” </p><p>“No, it’s too exciting, I want to stay,” she said. “Maybe we can finish it tonight.” </p><p>It was certainly optimistic, but rather than trying to explain that to her, I started working once again, adding all types of dungeon products that Eleanor provided me to help my experimentation. Crystallized monster blood, grounded armor plates, and all types of other stuff.</p><p>Some had formed a hexagonal structure I had been searching for, but not when mana was introduced. It just destabilized, refusing to form. “Can you explain to me how it feels to use mana?” </p><p>“In what way?” she asked. </p><p>“I don’t know, just general impressions. How does it feel? Is it a soft sensation, does it fight against your control. How does it feel to use mana through a skill, and how does it feel to use it directly?” </p><p>“And, you think that would help?” she said. </p><p>“Maybe. At least, it wouldn’t hurt,” I said. </p><p>She paused for a moment. “Alright. It’s a different feeling, particularly before and after using it. In the beginning, it’s like a soft current, or a calm ocean, still and waiting. But, once I touch it, it turns into a raging inferno, begging to be let out. But, a blast without control lets out nothing but an ineffectual flare.” </p><p>With a wave of her hand, she released a weak flash of fire. A second move sent a concentrated blast that melted the stone she had targeted. “Both attempts used the same amount of mana, but the first one was directionless, helpless. The second one was a concentrated blast, working on a pattern,” she said. </p><p>“Can you draw the pattern?” I asked. </p><p>“Maybe an outline,” she said, suddenly blushing. “I … I’m not best at drawing. Too bad you can’t get magic skills as external skills,” she said. </p><p>“Why is that?” I asked. “Other than wasting a skill, of course.” </p><p>“It doesn’t work. Unless you have corresponding stat points, you can’t absorb the skill,” she explained. “Are you sure you want me to draw? It won’t look good.” </p><p>“Doesn’t matter,” I said, ignoring the implications of what she revealed. It was another thing I hadn’t known. Instead, I examined the pattern she had drawn carefully. It was a complicated, confusing pattern, but I could see a vague pattern of hexagons at the center. “Does the mana flow from inside to outside?” </p><p>“Yes,” she confirmed, treating it as a casual question. It was not. A sudden inspiration hit me. Not the inspiration from Intuitive Forging — it felt distinct enough to be recognized — but a more ordinary kind, the same thing that I always felt when a mathematical model clicked in place. </p><p>“Once I reach that ocean, I give it a mental push, and the energy flows through the pattern, getting wilder and wilder until it suddenly transforms into fire.” </p><p>“Is it heat, or fire,” I asked. This time, it was to distract her as I cut my hand deliberately, bleeding some on the fire. Not just blood, but also as much Health as I could imbue, and the wound recovered immediately. </p><p>[-15 Health] </p><p>“Hard to say. How do you distinguish them —” she started, only to freeze as she sniffed. “Is that blood.” </p><p>“I was careless. A little work accident,” I said even as showed my hand, the wound already recovered. “Can you imbue the fire with mana as usual? Your explanation inspired me.” </p><p>“Fine,” she said, and I repeated the process. I mixed the Health I imbued into my blood as an inoculation agent while I let the hexagon pattern establish, working with a razor-sharp focus. I pulled the small piece of metal from the fire, and put it into water. </p><p>The moment I did so, I felt the familiar feedback from the System. One that confirmed my success even before I read the notification. I closed my eyes for a moment, enjoying the sense of triumph — </p><p>One that immediately turned into shock the moment I read the notification. I gaped at the result. </p><p>[Forge (Common) - 23 -&gt; Mana Forge (Rare) - 10]</p><p>I didn’t know what shocked me more. The fact that the skills could transform unaided, or the fact that they could jump two stages directly to Rare. Or that there were Production skills of that rank. Too many questions, enough to make me freeze in shock. </p><p>A shock that transformed into a different kind of shock when I heard the door open, followed by some kind of sharpness that threatened to drown me. I only calmed down when I realized it was Eleanor. “What’s going on … here,” Eleanor gasped, panicked, frowning as she looked at Maria.</p><p>At first, I thought it was because she had a bad day. Then, I followed her gaze, and blushed and turned away. Lost in my mind, I didn’t notice that her robe was rather disheveled. Understandable, as Forge was a hot place, but that didn’t make my blush any less intense. Her cleavage was rather … impressive. </p><p>“Maybe you should fix your dress, my lady,” Eleanor said pointedly. </p><p>“Sorry, it was just getting hot,” Maria replied. I avoided her gaze, not wanting to make it any more awkward. </p><p>“Yes, a fire mage getting bothered by the heat. Very reasonable,” Eleanor said. Her tone sounded sarcastic, but I didn’t understand why. “Sorry Devon. There’s an emergency meeting,” she said as she dragged Maria away. </p><p>“Be ready for the leveling trip tomorrow —” Maria said. </p><p>“No. You have a thing. You can’t go,” Eleanor cut her even as they disappeared, leaving me alone in the forge. </p><p>It had been weird, but soon I ignored it. </p><p>I had a new skill to play with. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“So, what’s the plan,” she said, looking excited. </p><p>“We’re going to start with something simple,” I said even as I started thinking about what to try. I already had several experiments already designed, but every single one of those relied on mana under my direct control as I played around with broken enchantment. I had no idea how to replicate it directly. </p><p>A challenge. </p><p>“Like what.” </p><p>“First, let me warn you. Experimenting is a slow process. It might take hours and days before I make even the slightest progress,” I said. That warning could change her mind, but it was better than the alternative. </p><p>The last thing I needed was for her to blame me for misleading her. </p><p>“Don’t worry. Unlike what Eleanor claims, I’m not a child with poor attention span,” she replied. “Now, what do I need to do.” </p><p>The answer was simple. I pointed at the forge. “Can you imbue the flames with some excess mana,” I said. </p><p>She frowned. “I don’t know. I never tried. I usually try to cast more effectively, not less.” </p><p>“It’ll be a good experiment for you too, then,” I said. </p><p>“Sure, but why do you need it?” she asked. </p><p>“I’m wondering if I can forge a mana-infused ingot,” I said. </p><p>“Do you think you can do it?” she asked, suddenly far more excited than I expected her. </p><p>That was not the reaction I had been expecting. “Maybe,” I suggested, careful not to feed her excitement even more. </p><p>“Good, because they are quite rare in the System Store,” she replied. “If you can figure out a way to do it, it should bring us considerable income.” </p><p>I frowned, though it was not about her already staking a claim on the results of a possible success. No, that, I was used to. In academic research, the results were usually split between the university and the organization providing the grant, leaving nothing but a couple papers for the researcher. </p><p>Also, the world was too dangerous for me to have sole possession of anything truly valuable. </p><p>No, I was frustrated, because she had lazily confirmed another thing that I had only theorized about. I had thought that I knew how much living in a small town had been holding me back. Learning the enormity of my mistake was not fun. </p><p>I ignored my spiraling frustration as I pulled an ordinary iron ingot, one of the many Eleanor provided for my experiments. </p><p>While such ingots had been used a lot during the first days of Cataclysm — often to hastily forge piles of weapons that shattered helplessly against the monsters — lately, they were only used to make arrows, javelins, and other disposable items. </p><p>And, even then, they were used against the weaker targets. Anything dangerous required a better alloy that had been forged with dungeon products. They couldn’t even used to repair the weapons from the System. </p><p>Those ingots could be purchased from the System store directly — the cheaper method — but forge offered a more expensive alternative in case, using some of the dungeon products to turn ordinary metal into alloys that could hold the enchantments; and, as a consequence, could be used to repair enchanted weapons. </p><p>However, it was not even popular before the repair spell started to become commonplace. After that, it had fallen completely out of favor. </p><p>During the last few days, I had used that method several times to forge a few different alloys, which only worked when I followed the System instructions to the letter, any diversion easily ruining it. </p><p>Still, it hadn’t been a waste. I used Inspect every step of the way and reached some conclusions about how it worked. Essentially, those dungeon products dispersed across the alloy, which effectively functioned as foreign particle inoculation by allowing the metal to crystallize around it. Once the metal cooled around those particles, they dispersed, providing the metal some kind of extra energy that reminded me of Health. </p><p>Not exactly the same, but similar enough. </p><p>I wasn’t planning to replicate it using Mana, which had been a mere curiosity. But, somehow trapping mana into ingots was the best way I could come up to leverage Maria’s sudden offer to help. It was a long shot, but maybe Intuitive Forge would help bridge the gap. </p><p>While Maria continued to experiment with her magic, focusing steadily on the small flame dancing on her palm, I pulled several papers and filled them with formulas. </p><p>Unfortunately, to my shame, they were less about representation — I still didn’t know enough about metallurgy to accurately model a completely new process — and more about convincing Maria that I knew what I was doing. </p><p>Hopefully, it would be enough to convince her that I was actually working for something rather than poking around blindly. </p><p>While I was scribbling the notes, Maria finally spoke, barely ten minutes after she started. “I have done it. One elemental spell, with extra useless mana. It’s easier than I expected.” </p><p>“Only because you’re talented,” I said. I had no idea about the difficulty of it, but when it was doubted, going with a compliment felt like a safe choice. “Now, you need to make that flame larger and directly apply on the metal, infusing it with mana.” </p><p>“That sounds … easy,” she said. “It can’t be all, right?” </p><p>I chuckled. “Not even close. Do you want me to explain what are we doing?” </p><p>“Sure. I don’t have anything else to do. And, I can have a break from demolishing you in chess.” </p><p>I responded with a matching chuckle. A little bruised pride was certainly worth the assistance of a high-level fire mage. I didn’t even know how much I would have to pay if I needed to hire someone to do the same. </p><p>“Fair. Now, to the lesson. Melting the metal could only be defined as a preparatory step. Only when the metal is properly melted, which is iron in our case, alloy alloy-making process can properly begin.”</p><p>“But, don’t we only have iron there? I thought alloys were a mixture of multiple metals.” </p><p>“Not necessarily. The common definition is a metal mixing with another substance. For example, steel is made from a mixture of carbon and iron, and the carbon comes directly from the coal.” </p><p>“Is this what we’re doing?” she asked. </p><p>“No. The first round is essentially a control group for our experiment. I want to see how iron and mana interact without any external factors. I’ll observe the process through my perk. That way, I will know how it works in its natural conditions. That way, I could measure the success of other attempts.” </p><p>“Can you detect mana?” </p><p>“Only when it’s interacting with a metal directly, like enchantments. But, it’s just the outer structure. Their inner aspects are inscrutable.” Well, that was not completely true after I received Inspect, but I didn’t mention that. </p><p>With that, I quickly shaped the molten metal into fifty coins, split into ten equal groups of differing sizes, five coins in each group. Maria looked like she was about to ask something, but I gestured her to be silent. </p><p>Stretching my Inspect into multiple groups was not difficult, but I couldn’t split my attention. Instead, I quickly scribbled a long line of data. Only when the mana dispersed completely from all coins, I stopped. </p><p>“What was that?” she asked. </p><p>I smiled. “It’s simple. Each column represents one coin. The numbers are between zero and one. Zero represents no mana, and one is the moment you stopped infusing mana.” </p><p>“But, why five samples for each size. Is there anything different in them?” </p><p>“Basic scientific principles. Having multiple samples would give me a better idea of the underlying process, and make sure my conclusions are scientifically accurate.” </p><p>“Sounds like a lot of extra work,” she said. “Does it really make a difference?” </p><p>“Yes. It’s often that the underlying data has some unique problems that affect the process. For example, one of the metal coins could have an air bubble or some other impurity that would affect the process. Drawing the wrong conclusion could ruin everything. Duplicates help reduce the risk.” </p><p>“Sounds like a chore,” she said. </p><p>“It often is. That’s why I miss having my own students. That way, I could throw data collection to them, and deal with the fun parts.” </p><p>“Nothing about math is fun,” she replied heatedly. </p><p>I chuckled. “I feel like I’m about to agree. I still need to calculate the correlation and the confidence intervals. It’s going to be a chore.” </p><p>“I thought you liked math.” </p><p>“Not this,” I answered even as I jotted down the formula for how to calculate correlation. “I need to calculate this for every group by hand. Even the most basic analysis requires thousands of calculations. Without a spreadsheet program or a math engine, it’s going to take all night.” </p><p>“No, it won’t,” she said with a smug smirk. </p><p>“What do you mean?” I asked, and she smirked as she wrote the numbers underneath each column. “What’s the result?” </p><p>“What is — ahh, Intelligence,” I said. </p><p>“Exactly,” she said, her smile wide. “I told you, I’m amazing at maths.” </p><p>While I didn’t treat anything that could be copied by a spreadsheet proper math, I wasn’t moronic enough to actually say that. Especially since she had just done the work of a computer with ease. “Yes, you are,” I said with a big smile. </p><p>“Now, another round,” I said, feeling far more enthusiastic. “Do you want me to explain what exactly I’m trying to find?” </p><p>“Sure,” she said. </p><p>“I already told you that melting the metal and mixing the components is more like step zero. The real process starts when the metal starts to cool down. Just like ice doesn’t melt immediately, the molten metal doesn’t exactly freeze at once. It starts with tiny seeds spread in its structure, called nucleation,” I started explaining. </p><p>She nodded, listening carefully. </p><p>“The second step is the crystal growth. Once the nuclei are formed, they start attracting the surrounding atoms, creating patterns in the metal. There are many factors for the shape of those patterns, from cooling methods to shape.” </p><p>“Is that what are we trying to do?” she said. “Trying to trap mana in crystal patterns?” </p><p>“Somewhat. The process doesn’t stop even after the metal cools down. The metal continues to change even after cooling down, slowly settling down into a more stable state, usually affected by the chemical structure. It’s called solid-state transformation. Ideally, we need to make sure the mana doesn’t escape even after that process is complete. But, you’re right. The initial objective is to trigger some kind of crystal structure that keeps the mana in.” </p><p>“Sounds complicated,” she said. </p><p>“Frankly, it is,” I answered. “If it wasn’t for my Perks and the help of the Skills, I wouldn’t even dare to attempt it. Normally, discovering a new usable alloy requires the combined efforts of hundreds of people, state-of-the-art equipment, and years of effort. We’re using skills to bypass a lot of those steps.” </p><p>“Interesting. You’re really good at explaining. No wonder you’re a professor.” </p><p>”I wasn’t really good at the beginning, but that’s what a decade of experience gives you,” I replied. </p><p>She froze. “A … a decade. How old are you?” she gasped. “I thought you weren’t much older than me.” </p><p>I smiled. Of course, it was impressive that I started teaching that early. “I’m thirty-two, but I started teaching when I was seventeen, during the second year of my doctorate,” I said proudly. In a world filled with people obsessed with stats, it was rare that I found a chance to brag about my greatest achievement. </p><p>“T-that’s good,” she said, blushing slightly, but looked relaxed. Why her reaction change like that, I had no idea. But then, I shrugged. She looked happy enough, which was all that mattered. </p><p>I had my experiments to run! </p><p></p>",

    "content": "<p>— Chapter 6</p><p>Decision made, I ignored the shouts outside as I focused on examining the forge. A forge that was far more expensive than I had ever worked with. </p><p>The first thing that caught my attention was the fire at the center, spilling out of the central forge. I walked closer, its heat washing over me intensely even at a distance, far more intense than I was working with. Still, I walked to the edge, letting the heat wash over me. </p><p>[-1 Health]</p><p>It was too intense for me to resist all day. At least, not without adding a few more levels first. </p><p>Still, I stayed at the center, watching the gold flickers dancing in the fire, trying to understand the reason for the intensity. Only to realize that the fire was eating the fuel at a shocking speed. Likely, it was some kind of enchantment to enable a higher heat. </p><p>It was fascinating to attain such a high degree of heat in an open fire. I took a step back even as I started examining the forge. It was both plain and flawless, which marked it as another product of the System store. I didn’t even want to imagine how much it would cost. </p><p>I turned my attention to the anvils and the other tools, using the Analyze to get a better sense of their enchantment. I couldn’t identify them without working on a lot of similar samples, but the sheer number of enchantments was enough to prove their quality. </p><p>“Troublesome,” I muttered even as I continued to check the room. They had spent a serious amount of capital on the forge, the kind that I hadn’t ever seen. No wonder Rosie was willing to make a big deal with them. </p><p>It was a tumultuous situation, the kind that was a wrong move that could cost me my life. The prudent thing would be to keep my head down and get away… but then what. What did prudence have given me other than being discarded and ignored? </p><p>I could probably keep my head down until the operation ended up in failure, but I would find myself in the same situation. With each passing day, the value of my class was getting lower and lower. Yes, a political battle within one of the upstart new so-called noble houses was dangerous, the kind that could end up in my death. </p><p>But, that was a valid concern for every expedition. </p><p>The rewards, however … </p><p>“No risk it, no biscuit,” I muttered even as I grabbed one of the unused hammers, far better than my own poor tool that doubled as a weapon. As I twirled it in my hand, I moved to the side, where a shockingly large pile of damaged weapons lay. The pile had hundreds of weapons, while a connected room held even more. </p><p>However, as I hovered above the pile, a sour smell hit my nose, coming from some of the weapons that hadn’t been cleaned properly. I ignored it momentarily as I picked one of the clean weapons. </p><p>It was some kind of short sword that was reminiscent of a gladius, but thicker. I pulled one from the pile, closing my eyes as I focused my [Analyze] ability, examining its inner structure. </p><p>Even without Eleanor’s earlier explanation, I could understand the reason for it. While it had some structural cracks that limited the impact of the Sharpness enchantment, it was nowhere near enough to turn the weapons useless. </p><p>No, that honor went to the edge, worn out as if it was dipped into a vat of acid. Though, curious, I touched one of the unclean ones, wondering why they kept it that tainted. But, I saw that the unclean ones weren’t more damaged than the clean ones. </p><p>The impact wasn’t as simple as the blood being acidic, but I shrugged. Each monster had its own unique problems, and while I would have enjoyed pondering about it, I was mature enough to admit that it was more of an intellectual curiosity than a practical concern. </p><p>I didn’t need to care about the political crisis that was going on, or the way those monsters degraded the sharp edges of the weapons. I just needed to focus on my job. </p><p>For the moment, I needed to start repairing. I walked back to the forge, letting the heat wash over the magical metal. I closed my eyes, using [Analyze] to keep track of the heating process. I ignored the heat brushing against my skin, and let System do its thing. </p><p>[-1 Health]</p><p>“Fascinating,” I muttered as I watched the process of the metal reaching the ideal temperature for reforging. In my old forge, it would have required twenty minutes for the edges to heat up enough without destabilizing the enchantment. </p><p>It would have been easier with the [Warm Blow], but lack of it wasn’t a bother. It was all about the timing. I pulled out the weapon, ignoring my skill’s instinctual suggestion to keep it in the flames longer, knowing that it would warp and weaken the enchantment. </p><p>I used my hammer instead of one of the better tools lying around. Not because of a sense of nostalgia, but to avoid introducing too many variables. With a practiced ease, I started hammering the edge, careful not to distort the enchantment even as I destroyed the edge completely, using some ext. </p><p>If the damage to the edge was lesser, some sharpening would have been enough, but not with this. I ignored the next step my skill was suggesting, which was to add more metal to bring the weapon to its ideal weight. It would help, but it would also increase the work time almost ten times. </p><p>Especially without [Warm Blow] to keep it going, forcing me to continuously heat up the metal to keep it searing and soft without turning molten.</p><p>Ordinarily, I could never get away with such a shortcut, even though it would make absolutely no difference. The moment even a new Blacksmith touched it, their [Repair] skill would trigger to inform that it was not correctly repaired, and I would have a reputation for shoddy work. </p><p>No one really cared about acceptable performance degradation. </p><p>I was hoping that my new employees would have a more open mind. They were dealing with a monster that destroyed multiple weapons a day. A faster repair should have been a more than acceptable tradeoff. </p><p>Assuming, of course, their operation continued, but that was a different problem. </p><p>I let my skill guide me as I delivered blow after blow, achieving a smoothness that I could never achieve in its absence. I might not want to follow its suggestions religiously, but that didn’t mean it was useless. </p><p>Especially since it was hard to truly use the Stats productively without the assistance of the skills. </p><p>I started humming even as my hammer landed again and again, reshaping the distorted metal that had been degraded by the acid, only stopping to heat the metal. </p><p>Forty-five minutes later, I moved away from the grinding stone, having just developed a new edge. I ignored the niggling of my skill that constantly niggled at the back of my mind, repeating that it was not completely fixed. It was like leaving the house without turning off the oven. A constant niggling.</p><p>Unpleasant, but considering I was able to finish the work in fifteen minutes when the contract required me to merely six weapons a day to start earning bonuses, more than acceptable. The clean whistle of the sword was only possible with a working Sharpening enchantment. Who cared what the [Repair] skill said. </p><p>I just needed to convince my new employers of that fact. </p><p>Taking a break was tempting, especially since the heat had been punishing. Even using Health to recover, it left my skin raw and tingling. It was not pleasant. However, I didn’t have the luxury of </p><p>Without taking a break, I grabbed a new weapon. It was time for another experiment, to see how much improvement the new tools would bring. </p><p>Once again, the benefits of the Repair reduced the adaptation period significantly. The first attempt took slightly more than half an hour. The second one shaved a few extra minutes. By the sixth, I was able to maintain a steady pace to bang down one at the twenty-minute mark, and that was with several breaks I used to check the new process. </p><p>Without them, a steady pace of fifteen minutes was doable. </p><p>I decided to impress my employers. I started repairing one after another, the metal gleaming with a healthy sheen under my consistent blows. It was fun, steady work — one that would have been much better without the constant niggling sensation at the back of my head. </p><p>It was already noon when I had a visitor. Eleanor was back, with an exhausted expression on her face. An expression that shifted to wonder and shock the moment she noticed the number of weapons that were waiting for her. “What’s going on?” she asked, tense.</p><p>“I’m working hard to earn my bonus, of course,” I said, trying to add some levity to the situation. It didn’t work. “Since someone just took away all the experts, I decided to see if I can find a way to go faster,” I explained. </p><p>“How. I thought you only have Repair.” </p><p>“Well, yes,” I said. “Before I explain, check the weapons first and see if they are properly fixed,” I said. I didn’t want to explain what I did before she checked the results directly, not wanting to prejudice her. It was a very critical part of any experiment that required subjective assessment. </p><p>She frowned as she tested the weapons one by one, with a slight frown on her face as she assessed them. Yet, the clean whistle of the sword was unmistakable. “It feels alright,” she admitted. “Now, explain.” </p><p>“I used some shortcuts that don’t exactly follow the Skill completely, so, technically, they are not completely repaired.” She said nothing, but her expression shifted from affable and confused to sharp. It would have scared me, but against Thomas, she had been much scarier. </p><p>I gave her a detailed summary of the process, which mollified her somewhat, but she also looked confused. “Looks promising,” she said even as she took five swords. “Follow me, we’re going to explain it to Lady Maria.” </p><p>I followed her with a sigh. I hoped that the redhead wouldn’t be too frustrating. </p><p>***</p><p>— Chapter 7</p><p>I examined the camp as I moved forward. As far as I could see, the camp population had dropped significantly to something around two hundred, which no doubt made any dungeon incursion a bigger challenge. Even working overtime, most of that number had to be dedicated to camp defense, which probably ruined any chance of making decent progress with the dungeon until the reinforcement Rosie promised arrived. </p><p>Though, I had a feeling that Rosie would offer them another batch of recruits, naturally with some premium for emergency recruitment. But, I kept my mouth about that. Whatever deal they had was between them. </p><p>I just wanted to make some money. And, maybe, get a few skills in the process. </p><p>We soon arrived at the largest building. “Wait here,” she said as she went inside with the swords. I said nothing, ignoring the hesitant glances of the camp visitors, no doubt wanting to ask the newest face some questions. </p><p>Their anxiety was understandable, but I deliberately avoided their gazes, not giving anyone a chance to interact. Whatever that was going on was complicated enough to make sticking my head — any more than I already would once I started churning out a ridiculous amount of swords, at least — an unwise choice. </p><p>“You can come in,” Eleanor said when the door opened once more. “Lady Maria is ready to see you.” </p><p>I nodded and followed her, taking note of the decorations. It was well-furnished. Much better than what I would expect in a camp in the middle of nowhere. Either Maria was even more spoiled than I had assumed, or her family was even richer. </p><p>Either way, a bigger trouble. </p><p>I refrained from sighing in despair even as Eleanor led me to an office that was filled with parchments, leather-bound books, and many glowing objects, all clearly enchanted. </p><p>“Eleanor tells me that you can repair five times faster than our other blacksmiths. How?” she asked, trying to look serious and in control. She wasn’t particularly successful. Luckily for her, the memory of her burning multiple monsters with a wave of her hand was more than enough to compensate. </p><p>I thought about breaking down the process, and dumbing it down to the most understandable piece, but after some consideration, I decided against it. She didn’t seem like someone who would appreciate anything she could understand. </p><p>“May I ask how familiar you are with math, my lady. I’m using some scientific methods to expand the benefits of the skill. It allows me to bypass some of the steps given by the Repair skill.” </p><p>“And you know it works, how?” she asked, the challenge in her tone clear. </p><p>The answer was simple trial and error, but I had a feeling that she wouldn’t appreciate it. “A proper explanation of some detailed formulas. May I proceed with it?” I asked. </p><p>I caught a hint of panic on her face before she looked frustrated. “I was a college senior when the Cataclysm hit, and more importantly, I’m a Fire Mage. With Intelligence, I can easily understand anything a mere Blacksmith could come up with.” </p><p>Her confident declaration made me even more confident about my choice. I paused for a moment, remembering some of the formulas I had read in the journals I had found. Formulas were nothing more than intellectual curiosity as they were mostly random, scattered articles with no proper link. </p><p>Still, they were good enough to dazzle an overconfident student whose understanding of math probably ended up in algebra, and Intelligence was not useful in understanding completely unfamiliar concepts. </p><p> “Let’s start with a simple basis. JMA equation for recrystallization process of metals. The formula is simple.” I paused for a moment, jotting down the first formula. </p><p> [X(t) = 1 - exp[-(kt)^n] </p><p>“X represents the volume fraction of the material of transformation, t represents time, k is constant, and n represents an exponential of dimensionless number that reflects the dimensionality of the growth and nucleation behavior during the transformation…” </p><p>She tried to hide it, but I taught for years. The glassy expression of a student who had lost track was too familiar to miss. Under any other situation, I would have slowed down, and explained every concept one by one. This time, I threw more and more complicated concepts. </p><p>I wasn’t good enough in material sciences, but dragging the discussion to a more pure math basis wasn’t too hard. Fifteen minutes later, I was deep into a small, confusing lecture on the fifth-order differential equation and their effectiveness in solving wave propagation. </p><p>“Enough, I have got the gist of it,” Maria cut in, unable to keep her frustration. “The math looks solid, and Eleanor already confirmed the weapons are good enough. So, go ahead and start teaching the others how to do it. We’ll need a lot of swords soon.” </p><p>I was about to cut in, when Eleanor cut in first. “We currently don’t have any other Blacksmith in the camp, madam.” </p><p>“How? Only the six of them were under family contract.” </p><p>“Yes, but we still hired the others through the usual channels. That contract has the escape clauses. They … they decided to pay it off.” </p><p>“They paid fifty gold each,” Maria gasped. “That bastard must have given it. Can’t we …” </p><p>“We don’t have evidence,” she said. </p><p>“I’m sure Rosie could find a few more experts in emergency. They don’t need Level 25 Repair. As long as they have Analyze, I can teach them,” I offered. I thought about asking Maria for a bonus, but I chose against it. I had already annoyed her enough. I could talk to Eleanor about it. “But, I can’t repair all day,” I said. </p><p>“Why? You already signed the contract,” Maria said. </p><p>“Because my level is not high enough. Four hours already drained most of my Health. I need to be higher level.” </p><p>“That’s easy,” Maria said, looking at Eleanor. “Where’s the closest wild spot we could visit,” she asked. </p><p>“But, I can’t leave the camp with the guards gone, and we don’t have any guards strong enough to help him.” </p><p>“Doesn’t matter. I’ll help him,” Maria replied. “I can’t stay here and defend the camp without depleting our mana potions. Just escort him to the armory and give him armor. I don’t want him dead.” </p><p>“I will do as you wish. Should I arrange for an escort—” </p><p>“No, I don’t need any,” she replied, her tone final. Eleanor looked frustrated. Maria sighed. “You know we can’t afford any. Not unless we are willing to clean the dungeon entrance again.” </p><p>Eleanor sighed. “You’re right, but I don’t like it,” she said. Then, she turned to me. “Follow me,” she said. </p><p>I followed as she brought me to the basement, which was filled with weapons and armor. Most of it was the type the guards had been wearing, but a few of them looked better. “I don’t have to tell you that if anything happens to her…” </p><p>“I understand,” I said. I didn’t appreciate being threatened, especially since Maria was far stronger than me, but it was not exactly a helpful conversation to have. Instead, I focused on something more productive. “My contract doesn’t have anything to do with teaching,” I reminded her. </p><p>“You want more money,” she said, her tone not exactly welcoming. </p><p>“That would help, but I have something else in mind. Something that could help your side as well.” </p><p>“What do you need?” she said. </p><p>“I need books from before the Cataclysm,” I replied. “Preferably about material science, manufacturing, and similar topics, but I’m alright with anything. If it has numbers, it might help.” </p><p>“What’s the point?” she said. </p><p>“Well, you have seen my trick with repairing the edge. I can only do that because my calculations gave me the ideal temperature to work on the edge. There’s a chance I can find an even better method as long as I have the necessary material.” </p><p>“And, you can do that as a Blacksmith,” she said. </p><p>I shrugged. “I have a Doctorate in Math,” I said, giving her a simplified version of my background. No need to muddle it with my other expertise. “And, unlike what most people claim, math can still be useful.” </p><p>“Not as useful as skills,” Eleanor replied. </p><p>“Probably,” I said. I strongly disagreed, but after three years of having the same conversation many times, I was bored of explaining to people why it was ridiculous to restrict themselves to the System just because it was easier. “But, I’m assuming you don’t have one of those useful skills, or you would have already given it to your old blacksmiths.” </p><p>“Well, no,” she said. “Skill stones for production classes are hard to find. The System Store hardly stocks them, and they rarely drop from dungeons.” </p><p>I sighed. I certainly know that, which was a pity, because the biggest advantage of production classes was having more skill slots. Another unfair detail, of many. “So, that’s why I’m asking for books. I assume it won’t be too difficult for you. Even I was able to collect some, and I live in a small town.” </p><p>“Probably, I need to check it,” she said. “But, meanwhile, we can discuss your salary —” </p><p>“No, I rather leave it to Rosie,” I replied, cutting it short. The situation was too complicated for me to navigate. I didn’t even know what kind of money I could ask for. “But, I wouldn’t say no to a combat skill if you have any.” </p><p>“You use hammers, right?” she said. “You’re lucky. We have one uncommon hammer skill. We also have several uncommon sword style variants if you’re interested,” she added. </p><p>“For now, it’s better if I stick to hammer,” I said. It was better to stick to one weapon, especially since it paired better with my class stats. However, I was fascinated by the casual manner she pulled a glowing rock from a box and threw it at me. </p><p>[Skill Stone: Hammer of Might (Uncommon)]</p><p>As the notification popped, I was glad that I chose to bargain with Eleanor rather than Maria. She was certainly the more generous one. Not for no reason, as I had just solved their biggest logistic challenge, but I knew many that would spit on my face rather than listen to it. </p><p>I was more than happy. </p><p>I closed my eyes, absorbing it slowly.</p><p>[Overhead Strike (Basic) 4 -&gt; Hammer of Might (Uncommon) 1]</p><p>I groaned. It was the second time I was absorbing a skill stone — since repair and forge had come with the Blacksmith class — but replacing a similar skill felt much more different. It was dizzying and painful. I barely registered Eleanor checking several armors to find one that would fit to my size. </p><p>Absorbing skills were painful. </p><p>***</p><p>— Chapter 8</p><p>I had a new armor, a new uncommon fighting skill that increased my fighting capabilities significantly, and there was even a proper warhammer on my back. Unfortunately, none of them helped against the challenge I was about to face. </p><p>Another flight. This time, with my new boss. </p><p>I said nothing as I climbed my part of the saddle, and grabbed the leather hard, glad that she wasn’t particularly observant. I didn’t exactly enjoy talking to people about my anxieties, and even if I did, my new boss was not exactly the ideal target. </p><p>“Ready?” she asked as she climbed with far better grace. </p><p>“Yes, my lady,” I replied. I might find the sudden shift back to feudalism ridiculous, but my feelings weren’t strong enough to risk annoying my new boss who could successfully imitate a flame thrower. And, admittedly, the fact that what they paid me for a day’s effort was more than I made in three years helped quite a bit as well. </p><p>“Good,” she said as she commanded the griffin, and once again, we were suffering an unnatural, disgusting act that humans weren’t supposed to experience. I took a deep breath, ignoring the vertigo as we flew, Maria easily took down any flying beast that dared to drift closer. </p><p>I expected her not to deign to speak to me. I was wrong. “Do you play chess?” she asked without a preamble. </p><p>I sighed. Even when dealing with vertigo, I could understand her aim. While my earlier trick with the math lesson convinced her that I knew what I was doing, it also annoyed her. She wanted to prove herself. </p><p>“Yes. I was a high-ranking master before the Cataclysm,” I replied, doing my best to sound proud rather than frustrated. My past with the chess had been rather checkered. It was a fun game, but I had always hated how people equated it as a shortcut to prove how smart they were. And, as a genius who started teaching at a premier college younger than almost all of my students, I had been challenged many times, forcing me to learn more just to stay on top. </p><p>After the Cataclysm, it got worse. Suddenly, playing chess to prove capabilities turned common. Intelligence stat allowed people to make calculations faster and multitask better, a devastating advantage for chess. I was quick to stop playing after that. I wasn’t entirely free of competitiveness, and being demolished every time I played was not fun. </p><p>But, it looked like it was about to change. </p><p>“Do you want to play blind chess to pass the time?” she asked, her enthusiasm clear. </p><p>“Of course,” I answered, doing my best to fake enthusiasm. She just asked, but I decided to take it as an order. If all it took to be demolished in a few chess games to get her in a good mood, I was more than happy to make that sacrifice. </p><p>Especially if it distracted me from the fact that I was in the air. I closed my eyes. “Pawn, e4,” I said. A classical move, one that led to many of the classic openings. A few moves later, I had a significant advantage. Not only did I have absolute control of the center, but also I was ahead of a pawn. </p><p>Unfortunately, that advantage was temporary. My knowledge of openings gave me a great advantage during the first ten moves, but the moment the game settled, that advantage started to dwindle. A knight cut through the side in an unexpected move, but every attempt I made to defend pulled me deeper into the quagmire. </p><p>I sighed as I tried to come up with a good move, but failed repeatedly. Most of the moves she had made felt ridiculous. Her fundamentals were horrible, and the strategic implications didn’t matter. </p><p>Unfortunately, none of those mattered when she simply could outthink me, like she was using a computer to calculate her moves. I felt like a sickly boxer fighting against a giant. I held the advantage in technique, but it didn’t matter against an enemy that could shatter my bones with each move. </p><p>“I surrender,” I called in frustration in move fifty, about twenty moves after my defeat had been set in stone. In any chess tournament, such a move would have been derided as pointless pride, but Maria clearly enjoyed taking my pieces one by one to lord over her superiority. </p><p>“Good game,” she said, her voice far more cheerful. “Another one.” </p><p>“It won’t be easy this time,” I replied, doing my best to sound confident. Luckily, Maria wasn’t observant enough to understand I was indulging her with fake competitiveness. </p><p>As I started with another classic move, I wondered if there was a chance to make it more fun. Maybe if I could tailor my game against her. Not to win. No, that part was truly hopeless. But, I could try and optimize my game to counter her advantages as much as possible, and lose gracefully. </p><p>Also, any distraction from my current activity was a welcome bonus. </p><p>For the next several games, I focused on the way she played, trying to reverse-engineer the approach. While she played very good chess, it was very different from playing a chess grandmaster. It wasn’t even like playing against a chess engine. It was more like the reverse. Bad strategic moves, only to be resolved through sheer creativity until I found myself in a position that was impossible to comprehend based on any sane application of chess theory. </p><p>It was not a complete surprise. I had already known how Intelligence worked thanks to my previous research — at least in general terms — and I had played with other people with Intelligence until it became too frustrating. </p><p>However, it didn’t make two people would play chess the same way. Strength allowed people to hit harder, but people still had their own fighting style. Some chose relentless direct assault, while others fought carefully, and defensively. </p><p>Maria, to my absolute lack of surprise, belonged to the first category. She started slow, probably to enjoy her upcoming victory, but the moment she started playing seriously, she delivered attack after attack. I tried to trap her, but her Intelligence made it easy to catch them. </p><p>“And, checkmate,” she called as we landed, smiling smugly. “That makes it, thirteen to zero.” </p><p>“I’ll get you the next time,” I fake-growled, trying to convince her that her victories bothered me. To be fair, they would have … but it was bliss compared to focusing on the silent torture of flying. Playing against her required my full focus, distracting me from the fact that we were floating. </p><p>“We will see. We still have the return flight,” she said. </p><p>I looked around, taking note of our surroundings. An empty plain, with no human in sight. Instead, there were a lot of monsters. Some vaguely looked like animals, as if they were painted by an impressionist painter who was suffering from a drug overdose, while the others vaguely looked humanoid. </p><p>A nightmarish horde that was currently gathering toward us. </p><p>“I’m going to burn them until they can’t move. Just walk through the piles and smash them,” she said, utterly calm. </p><p>I couldn’t blame her, not when she easily destroyed a hundred creatures with a wave of her hand, leaving mostly cinders. I moved forward immediately. </p><p>It was a great opportunity. </p><p>I stood in front of the first beast, a giant wolf immobilized thanks to its incinerated limbs, my hammer rose and fell. It was a familiar move, one that came from my Overhead Strike skill. I was glad that my new Uncommon skill had a similar move, allowing me to adapt with ease. </p><p>My hammer fell with far greater impact than I was used to, showing the difference between the two skills. The difference between the two tiers was not for nothing. </p><p>“Move faster, we don’t have all day,” she shouted. </p><p>“Sorry, boss. New skill jitters,” I replied even as I moved. Only when I was smashing the third one, I realized that I hadn’t used the more formal call. “Sorry, my lady,” I said, not wanting to annoy her. </p><p>“I like the boss better. Use it when we’re alone,” she replied, laughing. </p><p>I smiled as well. She wasn’t nearly as unbearable as the first impression suggested once she warmed up. I smashed two more immobile beasts, and a notification arrived. </p><p>[Hammer of Might (Uncommon) 1 -&gt; 2]</p><p>“Fascinating,” I muttered. It was not easy to raise skill proficiency levels, or my overhead strike wouldn’t have lagged merely at four. However, the basics were hardly a secret. Skills leveled up more based on external feedback than anything internal. </p><p>For example, using more precious materials made [Forge] improve faster, and the better — and more damaged — the target weapon, the faster [Repair] developed. </p><p>And, for combat skills, the stronger the beast that had been killed, the easier they leveled up. Their damaged state reduced the feedback significantly. It was hard to gauge, but the first wolf alone probably improved the skill by two stages, and maybe even given me an actual level as well.</p><p>Though, considering it would have ripped me apart easily, I was more than happy to take the reduced feedback. I killed a few more until the System responded once more. </p><p>[Level 7 -&gt; 8]</p><p>[+2 Vitality, +2 Strength,, +1 Dexterity]</p><p>[Hammer of Might (Uncommon) 2 -&gt; 3]</p><p>“I have just leveled up,” I informed her. As much as hiding it was tempting, I didn’t forget her casually using a spell to check my level. No need to take risks for small benefits, particularly since she was so generous while helping me. </p><p>“Faster than I expected. Very good,” she said. “Let’s see if we can bring you to your first threshold,” she called. </p><p>That made me gasp. The first threshold was level twenty-five. And, in three years, I was merely level seven. Yes, I didn’t prioritize it, but that didn’t make the gap any less impressive. </p><p>“Yes, boss,” I replied, tightening my grip on my new warhammer, and moving between targets. There was no heroics, no unexpected developments, nothing. Just a steady massacre of monsters without even bothering to harvest one, leaving material that was potentially worth hundreds of gold. Or, would have been if they weren’t burnt to cinders, and we had the ability to carry them back to the camp. </p><p>Soon, however, I realized another problem. Maria was getting bored. Understandable. While it was a thrilling activity that strengthened me significantly, it represented nothing but boredom for her. </p><p>“Pawn D3,” I suddenly called. </p><p>“E6,” she replied, her boredom replaced by some amusement. Constant defeats were not fun, but I was more than happy to accept it if it allowed me to level up rapidly. And, it helped me to analyze her playing style even more. The more we played, the better I fared. </p><p>When she finally called a stop, it was already dusk. “Let’s move back. It’s not safe to hunt during the night.” </p><p>I wanted to argue against it, but my arms were hurting too much to argue. Even with the System, there were limits to my endurance. “Yes, boss,” I called instead. And, it wasn’t like I had any right to complain. </p><p>- </p><p>[Blacksmith - Level 22]</p><p>[Health 660/660]</p><p>[Vitality 44 / Strength 44 / Dexterity 22]</p><p>[Skills (3/8)</p><p>Repair (Common) - 24 [Analyze]</p><p>Forge (Common) - 8 </p><p>Hammer of Might (Uncommon) - 7]</p><p>***</p><p>— Chapter 9</p><p>I woke up at dawn. And, a quick bath later, I rushed to downstairs — my room was conveniently above the workshop — feeling very enthusiastic to work. Normally, I would say that my work ethics weren’t driven by external factors, and it was true … to an extent. </p><p>But, not only my new employer was far more generous than I expected, giving me a higher salary and assistance for leveling up, but also I was doing something other than just following the instructions of my skill. </p><p>A better salary, incredible benefits, and more fulfilling work… </p><p>While I was still a researcher at heart, and saw my class as more of an impediment than a career like the rest of the world seemed to, I had to admit, that those perks made suffering far more acceptable. I was ready to work — </p><p>Only for that enthusiasm to fade immediately I arrived at the workshop and found a scrap of paper waiting for me. One that had only one line. </p><p>‘We advise you to find a different job,’ the paper read. Next to the paper, there was a fat-looking pouch. I was tempted to touch it, but instead, I waved to one of the camp workers. “Please inform Lady Eleanor that there’s an emergency at the forge,” I said. </p><p>He looked unhappy about my intervention, but it wasn’t the first time I worked with people. I delivered the order confidently before going back in, implying that it was only expected for him to follow my requests. With the camp already in flux, he followed. </p><p>While waiting for her, I pondered about the message. I didn’t want to dismiss it out of hand, as it was clear that I found myself in a messy situation. Before the Cataclysm, such a thing might mean character assassination in the media. In this new world order, the character part was not relevant. </p><p>I wasn’t entirely happy about the risk, but the uselessness of previous efforts taught me that I couldn’t avoid risk without accepting I would live an ignoble, unremarkable life, seeped in utter boredom. </p><p>I wasn’t ready to accept it. </p><p>It was why I called Eleanor — one of the two I knew at the camp — and the more relevant party when it came to threats. She was responsible for the camp security, and I preferred to coordinate with her rather than ignoring it. She was the closest thing to a cop, and I rather not touch the evidence before she arrived. </p><p>As for why I was a target, it was obvious. I had just solved one of their biggest logistical challenges, and clearly, it was not a secret. </p><p>She arrived five minutes later. “I hope there’s something important. We need you working,” she said, frustrated. I could see that the challenge of running the camp below the ideal population was getting to her. </p><p>“This was waiting for me when I arrived,” I said, pointing at the paper and the small pouch. </p><p>She said nothing, but her frown tightened. She pointed at it, a slight glow on her to suggest she was able to use magic as well. “You haven’t touched it, right?” </p><p>“No, I thought it’s better to leave it to an expert.” </p><p>“Good call,” she said even as she used her sword to put the parchment into a small bag, then checked the pouch. “It would have burned the moment you touched. Though, I’m impressed you’re able to refuse the bribe. Fifty gold coins is not a small amount.” I gulped at hearing that. “Having second thoughts,” she said. </p><p>“No. I’m just afraid of what they’ll do next if their first move is to bribe me with what I was making for more than a year,” I replied. Unfortunately, it was not an exaggeration. I was certainly startled. </p><p>She paused. “Don’t walk around without your armor, and stay out of the shadows,” she said. I nodded. It was a smart choice. At least, it wasn’t as uncomfortable after my leveling. Also, I was surprised by the ease I accepted the risk of a possible assassination. But then, violence had become a far more acceptable method of dispute resolution since the Cataclysm. </p><p>Assassinations, duels, muggings, bandits… A lack of a central government was already showing its impact. </p><p>“Anything else?” I asked. </p><p>“No. I’ll post two guards to defend the workshop just in case. They’ll also bring your food. Stay inside, and start working.” </p><p>“Any idea about the daily target?” </p><p>“As much as you can manage. The dungeon operations will slow down until the next batch of recruits arrives, but it won’t stop completely. Until we can hire more Blacksmiths, you’re the only one that can keep us going.” </p><p>“I’ll do my best,” I said, making a mental note to take stock once I took a break. Eleanor walked back. “You forgot something,” I said, pointing at the pouch still sitting at the anvil. </p><p>“No, I didn’t. Take it as a bonus for your loyalty.” With that, she left. </p><p>I checked the pouch, only to find out that she was right. Fifty gold coins, a fortune. Being richer was certainly nice, but it only made me more stressed. It meant that their enemies were willing to spend fifty gold just for a chance to weaken the camp and slow down the dungeon.</p><p>”No risk it, no biscuit,” I said to myself, repeating the motto I had decided the day before. At least, I was benefiting greatly from the risks I was taking. It could have been much worse. Many people had died for much smaller rewards. </p><p>Fifty gold represented a lot of things. New skills. Better equipment. And, most importantly, enough money to throw around to get a position in one of the new research institutes, at least as an intern. </p><p>But first, I needed to work. I first focused on bringing the forge to an ideal temperature. Only when the heat hit my face hard enough to feel like I was burning, I grabbed a damaged sword, and started working. </p><p>[-1 Health]</p><p>The occasional consumption of health was much easier to ignore after almost tripling my reserves. The sword heated up quickly, and my hammer danced. “Fascinating,” I muttered even as I felt the metal reshape under my blows. Yesterday, I used every scrap of knowledge I had gathered over the last three years to reduce the repair time to fifteen minutes. </p><p>Now, it finished in four minutes, mostly because I didn’t need to reheat the sword again. With my increased level, I was able to complete the task in one attempt. </p><p>It was more due to increased Dexterity than Strength. It wasn’t that the latter was useless, but for the task of reforging an edge, the added control was far more useful. </p><p>An hour later, I was looking at fifteen swords that had been repaired to pristine condition. “Now, what to do?” I found myself asking. I could slow down intentionally, but that would make it problematic if they noticed my intentional reduction. </p><p>And, the better I performed, the more I could demand.</p><p>With that decision made, I continued to work, pushing my attention to the limit. It was quite tiring. One disadvantage of not following the instruction of the skill, that it was mentally exhausting. I couldn’t just let my wander and let my skill handle the hard work. </p><p>But, with hard work, came an unexpected reward. </p><p>[Repair (Common) - 24 -&gt; 25]</p><p>[Perk Options — Warm Blow / Efficient Repair / Inspect (Analyze)] </p><p>“Huh,” I muttered as the notification popped without a warning, informing me that my Repair had been improved ahead of schedule, giving me multiple dilemmas. </p><p>The most obvious dilemma was which perk to choose from. Warm Blow was the most obvious choice, which would boost my ability to repair the swords even faster. With it, there was a chance I could further cut it in half. </p><p>Efficient Repair was also useful, providing me with a chance to make a living even after leaving the camp. I didn’t even know that Efficient Repair was offered in Level twenty-five again. If I knew, I might have committed to a different plan — not that I was complaining. </p><p>Ultimately, however, I chose Inspect, the advanced version of Analyze, which was supposed to provide with even more information. I might have chosen differently a couple days ago, but now that my earlier commitment to Analyze had proven its benefits, I decided to lean on it. </p><p>But, even as I made that choice, my mind moved to the next implications. Namely, the speed it had managed out reach the next stage, far ahead of schedule. </p><p>It was enough to throw my earlier model of skill improvement. Worse, I had no idea about what was responsible. Maybe my leveling allowed it to get to the next stage. Or, maybe it was just the quality of the weapons that allowed me to improve them, as I had been repairing them at a far faster pace. </p><p>But also I was not completely repairing them based on the suggestion of my Repair skill, which should have slowed down the process. </p><p>“What a fascinating question,” I muttered as I smirked, feeling excited. I couldn’t answer it alone, but soon, I would have multiple experimental candidates who would work directly for me. </p><p>What better opportunity to actually collect some data to build a better model. I had tried to collect that information before, but self-reporting was notoriously unreliable. </p><p>I didn’t expect to discover anything new, as I had no doubt many people had been working on how skills worked. The direct benefit of such knowledge was too important. Unfortunately, the importance also meant that it stayed a secret. There were many differing public opinions, but gossip was different from than scientific process. </p><p>“Finally, a chance for proper scientific study,” I muttered in excitement. It wasn’t exactly the way I preferred. I rather work on the mathematical models and conceptual designs while my doctorate students deal with the boring experimental stuff, but at this point, I would take even the most boring experiment over the monotony of repairing the same weapon over and over. </p><p>I was actually starting to like my new weapon. </p><p>***</p><p>— Chapter 10</p><p>“Now, let’s see if the Inspect is worth it,” I said to myself even as I grabbed another damaged weapon. I dragged my finger over the blade as I closed my eyes, a subtle mental command enough to activate the feeling. </p><p>The internal structure of the sword once again appeared in my mind. I wanted to focus on the physical structure first, as the Inspect increased the amount of detail I could catch significantly. I was able to catch many microfractures and other stress points. The details of it were fascinating. </p><p>But, not as fascinating as the details I was able to pick from the Sharpness enchantment. With the Analyze, all I could see was a bunch of straight glowing lines that stretched from the hilt to the tip. That allowed me to reactivate the enchantment by repairing the metal of the sword, but its magical aspect had been incomprehensible. </p><p>Not anymore. Well, not the incomprehensible part. I could merely see some kind of movement in those previously opaque lines of mana, without any corresponding knowledge of what was going on. But, that didn’t ruin my mood. I was confident that I could leverage it even better. </p><p>Though, preferably later as far as the magic was concerned. As much as I wanted to start poking the enchantments, I knew that it was not a good idea. I didn’t have the tools or necessary safety measures. I didn’t even know what would happen if the enchantments got damaged, whether they just faded away or exploded. </p><p>”Baby steps,” I muttered even as I shifted my focus to the aspect I could understand. The physical components. Not just the first one, but every blade I had repaired. “Some changes are necessary,” I muttered as I realized that my earlier process had weakened the edge unnecessarily. Not exactly critical when fighting against beasts that destroy the sword after a few successful hits, but a major problem against anything else. </p><p>Still, an easy fix for the future. </p><p>I should return to my repair task, ideally to impress my new bosses with my success, but the temptation of another plan started to stir. A plan that had long been ignored because of its immense cost. A cost that was not relevant thanks to the overstocked workshop. </p><p>Improving my Forge skill. </p><p>The Forge was a neglected skill. A choice that was made not just by me, but the other Blacksmiths as well, for one simple reason. Unlike Repair, Forge was expensive to improve, requiring a lot of attempts. And, even when it succeeded, people preferred to buy premade enchanted weapons from the System Shop, cheap enough to make them useless. </p><p>Especially since it took hours, sometimes days to forge a weapon according to the directions of the Forge. It meant improving the skill required months of dedicated effort and money. Some Blacksmiths took the risk during the first year, usually sponsored by richer patrons, hoping to find some kind of synergy between the two skills. </p><p>They failed. </p><p>I could have tried the same, but those days, I was more focused on collecting the data for my research proposal, which had been a similar waste. Not to mention, I didn’t want to spend months improving a potentially useless skill. If repairing a weapon according to the System instructions was a chore, forging a weapon was a slow, tedious torture. </p><p>“Let’s see if wasting material could help,” I muttered even as I pulled a few ingots and threw them into the forge, softening them. Repair improved despite cutting corners. Maybe Forge would as well. The only problem, I wasn’t sure if I could turn the results back to ingots, because they were not pure but alloys. </p><p>Due to their process of forging, alloys could be tricky to refine back. </p><p>It was a fact that was true for even the ordinary steel that the world relied on before the Cataclysm. There were hundreds of types of steel based on carbon content, cooling process, and other minute additions, and they couldn’t simply be turned back. </p><p>It was even more relevant for the new alloys, which included many other types of materials, some exclusively from dungeon drops. It was why Forging caused the loss of material. It wasn’t simply some kind of disappearance. </p><p>Of course, just like Repair, Forge's skill came with some instinctual understanding of the recipes and methods for new alloys, including the mixing temperatures, process and timing, and cooling methods. </p><p>For the moment, with my Forging below level ten, all the information I had was ordinary, requiring no extraordinary dungeon drops and other complicated stuff. Back in town, I had calculated what would it take to actually bring me to my first perk. </p><p>Technically, I could have done it below twenty silver as far as the material cost went. Acceptable … but when I included the rent for the forge, and the loss of income from dedicated time, that amount had spiked to four gold even on the most optimistic scale. Using cheap materials meant that I needed to spend weeks on a single point. A waste for a skill that would potentially turn out to be useless. </p><p>But, it was back then. I had a forge dedicated to me that I could never afford otherwise, working with alloys I couldn’t purchase. </p><p>There was still a chance that it would be a total waste, but the temptation was too strong … particularly since I could mislead Eleanor. Not by fudging the numbers, of course. Not when I could claim that those experiments were how I managed to cut the repair time to four minutes. </p><p>An innocent white lie. I had told much worse lies during grant applications. </p><p>Science might be an honorable pursuit, but the same wasn’t true for grant applications. </p><p>I grabbed multiple ingots of the variant bronze alloy — one that was stronger than steel — and threw them into the forge, letting them heat up, while at the same time, I went through the designs that the skill provided, trying to pick the simplest one. </p><p>I settled on a small dagger. Normally, it would have been a terrible choice, as there was little chance they would be sold — daggers were not exactly the preferred weapons for giant monsters — but since they would go to waste, speed, and material consumption were more critical. </p><p>Once the material was ready, I focused on the skill, trying to find the most ideal method. Unfortunately, even as my hammer landed on the first time, there was no reaction. My skill level was too low to work on the material. </p><p>“Frustrating,” I muttered. I was hoping that there would be some kind of suggestion. There wasn’t. I did my best to follow my past experiences to forge a dagger. Using long tongs, I rotated it meticulously as I beat it repeatedly, flattening it. Then, I folded the metal into two, heated, and repeated. </p><p>Only for the metal to crack. A failure. A spectacular one. </p><p>“I wish it triggered the repair,” I said. Unfortunately, for that, a weapon first needed to be completed based on System specifications. Another clumsy detail of the System. </p><p>I tried four more methods, wasting four more ingots. Ironically, since my mistakes were so catastrophic, they didn’t exactly turn them useless. I could still use them to Repair — </p><p>“Oh, I’m a moron,,” I cursed myself, realizing that I had missed something very obvious. Yes, the Forge skill didn’t tell me how to work this particular allow. But, Repair did. </p><p>With a big smile, I grabbed another sword, but this time, I followed the System's suggestions religiously. An hour later, I was not even halfway repairing the sword — not having Warm Blow slowing it considerably — but that didn’t ruin my smile. </p><p>I had already learned a lot about how to use the alloy without fracturing the metal, and the detailed information provided by Inspect already showed its worth, though only because I had spent some time trying to understand every metallurgy resource I could find. </p><p>I made another attempt to forge a dagger. This time, I managed to fold the metal six times before I ruined it. This time, it was useless even for repair work, but I didn’t care. I heated up another ingot and made another dagger. This time, I only folded the metal four times before I started shaping it. </p><p>In every objective standard, it was a terrible dagger. It was structurally weak, brittle, lacking the necessary tempering to properly hold an edge, and had multiple stress points that begged to be snapped. Stabbing someone was more merciful than giving them the dagger as a weapon. </p><p>Yet, none of those details could ruin my mood. A notification popped. </p><p>[Forge (Common) - 8 -&gt; 11]</p><p>[Perk Options — Masterwork / Intuitive Forging] </p><p>I froze as I read the perk offers. Masterwork was one of the options I expected, but to my knowledge, the other perk was supposed to be Frugal Forge, which worked in a similar manner to Efficient Repair. Masterwork, on the other hand, provided better designs, but they cost more to complete. </p><p>“Why can’t the System give explanations for perks,” I muttered, frustrated even as I found myself in a dilemma. Should I pick Masterwork, or take the risk. But, even as I bit my lips in worry, I knew what I would do. </p><p>I had very little use for Masterwork. Even ignoring the name, just the fact that I was getting a previously unknown Perk was a good opportunity. It was very likely that I was not the first one to discover such an opportunity, but people didn’t go around sharing secrets.</p><p>I made my choice. </p><p>[Forge (Common) - 11 [Intuitive Forging]]</p><p>Curious of its impact, I started working on another ingot, forging another dagger. Once again, there was no detailed connection from the System, but as I worked, I noticed a change. Occasionally, I was getting a slight suggestion, allowing me to catch some big mistakes. </p><p>This time, I managed to fold the dagger properly ten times, and the rest of the process was smoother as well. When the dagger was completed, I had my reward. </p><p>[Forge (Common) - 11 -&gt; 12]</p><p>“Excellent,” I muttered as I melted the daggers to destroy the evidence, and returned to my repair work. Improving my Forge skill had been nice, and discovering a new trick to use Repair to improve Forge was even better. </p><p>However, I couldn’t forget the role played by the extremely valuable tools in the forge, the kind that I wouldn’t come close to purchasing even with my newfound wealth. </p><p>I needed to keep my employer happy. Luckily, all I needed was to repair enough weapons to keep them satisfied. Luckily, since I had yet to reveal my latest achievement of dropping it to four minutes, it was easy to keep them happy. Just another improvement to a rate of twelve minutes was enough. </p><p>I received another notification as I worked, which put an even bigger smile on my face. </p><p>[Repair (Common) - 25 -&gt; 26]</p><p>Sometimes, hard work was its own reward. </p>",

    "content": "<p>— Chapter 1</p><p>”Hey, Devon, I have your letter as well,” the postman said even as he walked through the workshop floor, passing around parcels and collecting coins as payment. “You have the payment, right?” </p><p>“Five silver. Right, Sam?” I asked, but his expression showed that it was not the case. </p><p>“No, the rates went up, now it’s six,” he said. </p><p>“Again?” I asked even as I dropped my hammer, a frown on my face. “It’s getting too much. How the hell we’re supposed to communicate with the other enclaves if it goes like this?” </p><p>He sighed even as he looked at me. “It can’t be helped, boy. Another outpost has fallen, so the letters from the coast have to be moved through another distant post. We’re not the only courier service that increased the cost.” </p><p>I reached my pouch and checked, but I knew what I would find. Five silver, and several coppers. I blushed even as I begged. I hated it, but the letter was too important. “How about you let me pay the old price? Say that you promised or something? I’ll pay you extra once —” </p><p>“Maybe you should stop, Devon,” Sam said with a sigh, his pitying tone hurting me worse than the time I smashed my hand with a hammer. “How many times it has been?” </p><p>“It’s different this time. I can feel it,” I answered. “I promised that I would work for free. With my education, they are getting a bargain. You know that…” But my confidence didn’t help as Sam passed me a letter, one that was too thin to be good news. </p><p>I checked the letter, only to throw it into the fires of my forge immediately. “Another rejection,” Sam asked. </p><p>I didn’t answer. I couldn’t. Not when he spoke in that kind tone, like I was a stupid child. I said nothing as I pulled my pouch and passed five silvers to him. What I was able to save after a month of working overtime. “I’ll find you next month. I have another admission prepared. I heard they were setting a new think-tank in the ruins of Cleveland.” </p><p>“Maybe you should stop working on the workshop and start going into dungeons. It has been three years, and you’re still not even level 10, and you know the walls of the town are hardly —” </p><p>“That’s enough Sam. I’m sure you have a lot of garbage to carry,” I cut him off sharply. I hated myself even as I said that. Sam was just trying to look out for me, one of the few people that even bothered to do so. He didn’t deserve my anger. </p><p>He wasn’t the one who refused to acknowledge my abilities because of a stupid fluke. </p><p>I hated his kind, understanding gaze even more. “See you around, Devon. Try not to kill yourself with your stubbornness.” </p><p>I sighed even as I grabbed my hammer once again, and pulled the red-hot sword from the flames. I smashed again and again, the way the sword trembled under my hands providing a good distraction. I had hated repairing stuff when I had first started, but after three years, it had turned into a hobby. A good way to keep my hands occupied while I focused on reworking the formulas. </p><p>But, today, I found it difficult to lose myself in the comforting world of math, not when I had to deal with another rejection. It hurt … though, it was the stupid reasoning of it that hurt. I would have accepted if it was just about my capabilities, rather than my Class.   </p><p>I had been rejected because I was a Blacksmith. A common class, one that didn’t even give a full range of Stats. Just Strength, Vitality, and Dexterity. </p><p>It was why I didn’t even bother reading the latest rejection letter more than a sentence, where they told me that my Class disqualified me from any kind of position in a think-tank. </p><p>Nothing else mattered. Not the fact that I had graduated college when I was sixteen, with double degrees in Math and Sociology. My doctorate in mathematical sociology didn’t matter, or the fact that I had been the leading name of my field before I even hit twenty-two. </p><p>Not when the Cataclysm hit, bringing the System along. Suddenly, no one cared about my groundbreaking papers that had the potential to reshape the socio-economical structure of the next century. </p><p>Just because I didn’t have Intelligence as a stat. Another sign of how our society degraded since the Cataclysm hit. Everyone chased bigger numbers to fight against the Cataclysm. A group of golden heroes, each identified by a mystic source of power and empowered through a convenient, easy-to-use interface, fighting heroically to stem the tide. </p><p>It was a wet dream of objectivist individualism that even Ayn Rand couldn’t comprehend.  </p><p>I slammed the hammer again, watching the sparks fill the room. Truthfully, I might have accepted my defeat with grace if Intelligence actually made people Intelligent. But, no, it did not, not any more than Charisma actually making people charismatic. </p><p>For the last three years, starting merely a week after the Cataclysm, I had interviewed almost a thousand people with Intelligence — sometimes openly, but mostly disguising as a conversation at the bar while plying them with drinks — until I had developed a solid understanding of how it worked. </p><p>It functioned more like a computer showed in someone’s mind. Perfect for finding the square root of six different ten-digit numbers before multiplying them in less than a second, or calculating the Pi to the ten-thousand digit immediately … but not helpful for actually working on the science behind it. </p><p>It was like hiring someone as a researcher just because they had their own expensive computer. Most of what they could do, I could easily replicate as long as I had a decent computer… Too bad the electronics didn’t work properly anymore, anything more fragile than a calculator had long fried during the initial days of Cataclysm, taking most of the infrastructure along with it. </p><p>“I just need an assistant with Intelligence, and I can still be useful,” I growled in frustration as I continued slamming, the usual lack of calm as I worked not helping. Still, even as my focus wavered, my [Repair] doing most of the work. </p><p>I paused when most of the surface work had been completed, touched the hilt, letting my sole perk [Analyze] do its work. </p><p>The inner structure of the sword flashed in a moment, showing me that there was still a subtle crack in its surface, one that would weaken the efficiency of its enchantment. How it would weaken, or why, I didn’t know. </p><p>However, unlike the other things, it wasn’t an impression that was fed back by [Repair], which didn’t include any magical repair knowledge, even if it was Level 24, almost about to get a second perk.</p><p>No, I learned that through repeated practice, even though I ruined several weapons in the process. Sharpness Enchantment was a simple one, just several lines of condensed mana, and it worked properly as long as I resolved the blockage. </p><p>I finished repairing it before I quenched the sword in mana water, another use of my [Analyze] confirming that it had been properly solved. </p><p>It was rare for someone to have a skill with such a high level, one benefit of the endless overtime I had pulled, trying to afford the ever-rising courier fees. </p><p>I sighed as I left my private forge room, and started walking toward the desk, carrying only one weapon. I frowned when I realized which supervisor was currently manning the desk. Mark. Not exactly my favorite person. “Only one weapon, again?” he asked with a nasty smirk. </p><p>“As usual, special order,” I said even as I put the weapon down. “The structural damage is repaired completely, and the enchantment should be working as usual.” </p><p>“Perfect. Let’s see how much money our resident genius deserves for it,” he replied with glee as he flipped open a book, and made a show of checking the numbers. “Wow, a whole sixty copper. You’re rich! I’m sure, this time you can buy that perk reset stone. I heard that the last one went for three gold.” </p><p>“Thank you for keeping an eye on me, Mark, I appreciate it,” I answered, trying to keep my voice cool. His nasty laugh showed that I wasn’t exactly successful. The fact that he was right only rankled me more. </p><p>As I walked back to my forge, I could see the others visiting the desk, and none of them carried less than five pieces of gear with them, despite the fact that none of them had their [Repair] as high as mine. All because, when Repair reached Level 10, I chose [Analyze] over [Efficient Repair], arrogant enough to plan forward how it would help me once I got a proper research job once the society started to recover. </p><p>Even if it didn’t, I assumed that the ability to repair enchanted weapons would allow me to make much more money. It looked like it would … until a dungeon nearby started to drop repair spells for mages. Just like that, the high-end repair market was gone. And, as the number of mages that could cast it continued to increase, even that was at risk. </p><p>I needed to reassign my perk. Something I could have achieved easily a year ago. That time, Perk Reset stones — the cheapest way of achieving it — went for about sixty silvers, while I was able to save almost ten silvers a week, which I wasted by hiring people to collect some data, arrogant enough to think that I was getting a head start for my job as a researcher. </p><p>Now, my [Repair] was almost Level 25, and once it reached there, the Perk Reset stone would turn useless, since it only worked on the last Perk received. </p><p>Improving skills got harder and harder, especially without renewed challenges, but even my most optimistic calculation — as a function of quality, work time, and a sudden exponential spike for the practice required to reach the next stage — suggested I had less than a month before I needed to purchase it. </p><p>Or I would get stuck with [Analyze] forever. </p><p>When I arrived at my private forge, instead of picking another weapon, I extinguished the fire, grabbed my hammer — the only thing I owned in the entire forge — and walked out of the workshop. </p><p>For once, I decided to cut the day short. </p><p>I had an important decision to make. </p><p>***</p><p>— Chapter 2</p><p>I liked having a nice glass of white wine while making monumental decisions, preferably a French Riesling of a decent vintage. </p><p>Unfortunately, it was not a luxury I was able to afford any more. Pre-cataclysm goods had long turned into an incredible luxury, even the cheapest box of wine would probably go for a gold coin during an auction. I didn’t think I could survive even seeing the price tag of my favorite vintage for such occasions. </p><p>Not when I couldn’t afford even the local moonshine. With only forty copper in my pocket, I would be skipping dinner for the next week and instead eat more during lunch — the greatest, and only perk my current work offered. </p><p>I took the long road back home, enjoying the bustle of the streets. It was a rare treat, as I was usually working during the day. And, it was rare to see people on the streets during the night. While it had been almost three weeks since a curfew had been declared, people were still reticent walking around during the night, afraid of another breach. </p><p>Not exactly an unjustified fear. The monsters were far more active during the night, and while the town had both walls and multiple patrols, they weren’t exactly a guarantee of safety. If they were, the last emergency curfew wouldn’t have been just weeks away. </p><p>I let my finger dance at the handle of my hammer even as I examined the buildings that were a mixture of wood and stone, with no signs of pre-Cataclysm architecture. They had been long destroyed during the first months of the disaster, the rebar steel in the walls far more valuable than anything else. </p><p>Though, they weren’t the only things that had been destroyed. Anything that contained metal had been long destroyed, usually cast into bars, forged into weapons that had been destroyed just as quickly as they had been made. </p><p>That trend finally stopped after the discovery of the first System store, allowing the exchange of goods and materials. It wasn’t cheap, but an enchanted sword in the hands of a high-level warrior was far more valuable than a thousand held by others. </p><p>The discovery of the System store was the first real hit for the production classes. Before, we were a critical part of the defense. Not just Blacksmiths, but Farmers, Carpenters, and many others. After the System store had been discovered just fifty miles away, that changed. We had been first reduced to repairing, and even that was the risk. </p><p>“Such fascinating developments,” I muttered. Despite all the problems it created for me, I was still captivated by the developments. After all, I was still one of the premier sociologists in the world. It was my passion to understand how human behavior shapes and shaped by various social aspects. </p><p>The irony was that, even as humanity was going through its single greatest change, I neither had the time nor the data to understand what was going on. And, no one cared about it, because my class didn’t have Intelligence as a stat.  </p><p>When I arrived at my home — a tiny room that was more similar to a prison cell than a residence — I found a paper hanging on my door. </p><p>A notice, declaring that, by next week, my rent would be increased from three silvers a week to five silvers. A very steep increase. “That might as well happen,” I growled even as I ripped it off. The room was already near the wall, and absent of anything that could be framed as luxury other than being a single-person residence — including a window. </p><p>But, I couldn’t live in a shared room. Not because I would hate it, but because I needed the space. I opened the door, carefully shuffling through piles of paper that covered every inch of the room, each half as tall as me. </p><p>The reason I had to live alone. My library. </p><p>Everything I was able to find went from home to home while people destroyed every inch of the old buildings. I didn’t know if anyone else bothered to save old books, but even if they did, they were probably hoarding them as much as I did. </p><p>While the pre-Cataclysm wine went for exaggerated prices, the same wasn’t true for the old books — for any other classical art form, but those I didn’t care as intensely — which had been mostly treated as a nuisance. </p><p>Instead, people cared about the new books, ones that had been either acquired through dungeons or purchased through the System store, describing the secrets of the magic, skills, and perks, some magical enough to directly improve the skill proficiency of anyone that was lucky to read it. </p><p>Compared to those, some old college textbooks weren’t particularly valuable. </p><p>Getting a shared room meant I had to get rid of all. </p><p>“God, I need a drink,” I growled as I threw myself on the bed, burying my face into the pillow. I had too many decisions to make. The first one was whether to continue applying to the newly established research centers, hoping that someone would allow me to work there. I was willing to work for free as long as I could get a closet to sleep in. I was even willing to bribe someone — unfortunately, I lacked the money to do so. </p><p>Focusing on acquiring the Perk Reset stone was another option. If I worked hard enough and sold all my assets — including my hammer, I thought even as my fingers brushed against the handle — I might be able to afford it before my skill had been improved. Even then, it was a close call. The latest price increase had truly surprised me. </p><p>Then, of course, there was my nascent library. The increase in rent meant that just to maintain my room was enough to cut my weekly savings by almost half. </p><p>I closed my eyes, trying to ignore the sudden, suffocating weight. Desperate, I reached my mind, calling the System, seeing eight lines of text that were more important than anything else I had done in the past, and would do in the future.  </p><p>[Blacksmith - Level 7] </p><p>[Health 210/210]</p><p>[Vitality 14 / Strength 14 / Dexterity 7]</p><p>[Skills (3/5)</p><p>Repair (Common) - 24 [Analyze]</p><p>Forge (Common) - 8 </p><p>Overhead  Strike (Basic) - 4 ]</p><p>“Depressing,” I muttered even as I dismissed the screen. None of the information there was a mystery, or even changed recently. With the sole exception of [Repair], the last time one of my skills had was a year ago, when I was forced to fight against a runaway monster,, and it was even longer before I actually leveled up. </p><p>I neglected leveling up for two reasons. For once, it wasn’t really valuable when it came to repair work. Most of the time, repairing a weapon only required a fraction of my Strength, and increasing it more wasn’t exactly a priority. </p><p>Of course, if it was just the relative uselessness, I would have still worked to level up. Extra power and health were not something I would turn up my nose in such a dangerous world.  But, there were two problems with it. </p><p>The first problem was simple. The stronger someone, the higher the cost of living. The higher levels required more energy, which meant more food consumption, preferably higher quality with more energy density.</p><p>It was problematic enough. Then, there was the fact that, it was expensive for a Blacksmith to level up. The easiest spots to level up had long been monopolized by the stronger groups, both the dungeons and the wilderness. </p><p>Anyone that wanted to level up either had to pay for the access, or brave the wilderness as a part of a party. Considering my financial situation was my biggest problem, the first was not an option. It was at one point, but I prioritized my research over it, which now lay in a corner of my library, gathering dust. </p><p>The second wasn’t exactly any better. There were only two groups that would accept a low-level Blacksmith, the absolute amateurs that would most likely die in the wilderness… </p><p>And, the exploration teams. </p><p>The experts pushed into the wilderness, searching for mines, new hunting spots, and even occasionally connecting with other towns. They had been critical in reestablishing the connection with the rest of the state after the Cataclysm, where even the geography had been reshaped, constantly penetrating through the wilderness. </p><p>Unfortunately, while they had achieved a lot, their death rate wasn’t too much lower than the amateur parties. They might be well-equipped professionals, but the dangers they faced were much higher. In the world after the Cataclysm, the unknown meant danger. </p><p>But, also, potential riches. A good discovery would mean an incredible payday, one that even my meager share as a Blacksmith would be measured in gold rather than silver. If I had enough gold, I could not only purchase everything I needed, but also afford to move to one of the new cities with the research organizations, getting one step closer to success. </p><p>I always avoided that, hoping to find myself a place that fit my skills rather than my [Skills], but maybe it was a mistake. </p><p>Maybe I had been too arrogant. </p><p>With a deep sigh, I stood up. It was time to make a change. </p><p>***</p><p>— Chapter 3</p><p>I disliked Broken Tankard. </p><p>It was a loud and crowded pub, filled with people who were far too happy to start throwing punches at the slightest disagreement. It was something I hated even before people started to have superpowers, and violence had become a perfectly acceptable form of self-expression once more. Also, the drinks were overpriced and terrible, and the food was even worse. </p><p>Despite all those, it had one redeeming factor, one that made sure I had to visit the place many times. It housed the single most active job board in the whole town for the people who were not a part of the guilds. People looking for parties, specialist jobs, trainers, guides, miners… </p><p>I bypassed the crowd and walked toward the receptionist's desk. Only to be interrupted by a familiar face. “Wow, that’s a sight for the sore eyes, Devon. Do you need information on the dungeons again, or are you buying information on the other towns?” Rosie greeted me. “We have managed to connect with another cluster, and I have some interesting stuff for you.” </p><p>Rosie was an interesting woman. She was young, cheerful, personable … and absolutely deadly in combat. I didn’t know what her class was, but it was clearly something better than a mere warrior. I had seen her go through a large group of wannabe gangsters who decided that trying to force her to pay a protection fee was a smart decision. </p><p>It was not. There was a reason it had turned into the defacto center for the independents. She had enough strength to ensure that she could hold the payments in escrow without being targeted by thieves — naturally, for a modest fifteen percent cut — or intervene as a third party in case of disputes. </p><p>She wasn’t exactly a bank, but it was close. </p><p>She was also too important to deal with an unimportant washed-up Blacksmith who made wrong bets in this new world until he turned completely irrelevant, but I had been a customer of hers since the beginning, so we had some rapport. </p><p>I shrugged. “Unfortunately, no,” I answered as I lifted my pouch, which was noticeably empty. “This time, I’m looking for a job.” </p><p>She frowned. “Follow me,” she said as she gestured, and I followed her to her office. “Don’t tell me you’re having problems with the workshop. Is it Mark?” </p><p>I wasn’t surprised that Rosie knew about my new supervisor even though it had been a while since my last visit. Her business relied on information. “No, he’s annoying, but not enough to kick me out. I’m still the only one that can repair the sharpness-enchanted weapons.” </p><p>She said nothing, and I sighed. I had already made that decision, but it didn’t make sharing any easier. “I decided to take a different job. Outside,” I commented. </p><p>That earned a raised eyebrow. “That’s a change of pace for you,” she commented. “What happened to Mister I’m-not-a-barbarian-thank-you-very-much.” </p><p>I shrugged. “He has been screwed up because he has misread the situation,” I said with a shrug. </p><p>“Oh, it’s rare for you to admit that,” she said. “What are you looking for?” </p><p>“Preferably as a part of the group that’s not filled with complete idiots,” I said. “Security over speed, but I need at least three gold coins as payment, but I wouldn’t say no to more,” I explained the conditions. </p><p>My request was not excessive. Three gold coins were hard to earn in the town, but the same wasn’t true for expeditions outside. A good working day meant somewhat around one and a half silver for me most days, and that was with working overtime. </p><p>Meanwhile, even a mediocre day outside for a hunting party brought more revenue. Anyone with revenue below five silver would be complaining about a slow day, and a good hunter easily had a revenue of twenty silvers a day. A gold coin in five days. </p><p>An incredible business … but one with a terrible rate of mortality. The exact rate was hard to pin down with many hunters going to long expeditions, sometimes choosing to just settle in another town without informing anyone. </p><p>Still, even without exact numbers, it was enough that a hefty hazard premium for the jobs outside the wall had become common place, with three times being the accepted benchmark, adjusted by the exact circumstances and need. </p><p>Meaning, that just by accepting to repair weapons outside, I could expect to earn at least five silvers a day rather than one and a half at a minimum. More if it was a more dangerous job, or it was something that required my abilities. </p><p>The post-Cataclysm economy was difficult to understand, especially without a central authority to guide it. </p><p>The only thing that prevented it from completely collapsing into barter was the System. For some reason, the dungeons actually produced money. Not just metals, but actual coins, stamped by the System. It was possible to melt them, but considering they were the only currency accepted in the System Stores, no one was stupid enough to do that for material gain. </p><p>Ordinary gold and silver were far less valuable. </p><p>Of course, I still didn’t understand why a hundred copper coins equaled a silver coin, and a hundred silver coins equaled one gold. It was a weird fixed exchange rate … or not so much, not in a world where monsters popped from every corner and every single person had superpowers.   </p><p>“Perk Reset stone?” she asked. I nodded, not surprised by her accurate guess. “You want to switch to Efficient Repair.” </p><p>“Looks like the best method,” I replied. “With the repair spell getting more and more ubiquitous, it looks like the best way.” </p><p>She paused, hesitant. Interesting. </p><p>Of course, I didn’t believe that she was actually hesitant. Not even for a second. While I trusted myself to read people well — one benefit of working as a professor for years — Rosie wasn’t as easy to read. I saw her hesitation, because she wanted me to see. “Come on, let’s not waste time. Just spill it,” I said. </p><p>She frowned before her expression settled to a calm smile. “Fine, ruin my fun,” she said. “You want to change skill just because you want to make money, right?” I nodded. “There’s a better way for you to do so. It’s still a secret, but…” </p><p>“Let me guess. You’re willing to introduce me to them for a finder’s fee,” I said. </p><p>“It’s good to do business with smart people,” she said. “It’s such a pity that you didn’t get a class with Intelligence.” </p><p>I didn’t respond to that. Rosie was too smart not to know my frustrations about that topic, meaning she was doing it intentionally to unsettle me. Another trick that my old career as a professor helped me to handle. Mobbing through snide comments was hardly unfamiliar. </p><p>She seemed to realize that it wasn’t effective, but that didn’t seem to bother her. I liked her, but she was not a particularly nice person. “A new dungeon is discovered. It’s about a week’s travel,” she said. </p><p>“I see,” I replied, tensing. “You want me to join there? Why?” </p><p>“Yes, and for payment, I just want you to write a report.” </p><p>“Really?” I asked. “Even if I don’t have Perception or Intelligence.” </p><p>She waved her hand. “I’m not worried about it. You might not have a good class, but I’m aware of just how much you know about them,” she commented. “I just need a detailed report from you about the dungeon, and I’ll not even ask for a cut.” </p><p>Coming from anyone else, that statement would have scared me. Despite my best efforts, I didn’t know much about the dungeons, but considering their importance, even the little knowledge I had could have turned me into a target. The only reason it didn’t scare me was the fact that Rosie was the middleman for all those transactions, and knew exactly how much I knew. Not to mention, my research focused more on the general details and how it affected the nearby towns rather than more militaristic details that people cared about. </p><p>While I spent a lot of money collecting data, it was not something most people found useful. I wasn’t trying to find the ideal skill and class combination to raid a dungeon efficiently, but to understand its impact on the communities around.   </p><p>Ironically, it made me even better for her purposes. However, it was clearly not as simple. </p><p>The discovery of a new dungeon was not a simple thing. Every dungeon was essentially a pocket universe, or at least some kind of expanded space. Their geography and the hazards hidden had little to do with the location they were in. </p><p>They were also filled with all kinds of monsters, some just enlarged beasts, some too hard to contemplate. Every step of a dungeon might result in death. Yet, people raided them regularly. One reason for survival. Letting a dungeon sit untouched too long was never a good idea. Its potential continued to build up … until one day, it broke, spreading those nightmares around. </p><p>Yet, that wasn’t the reason people were desperately searching for dungeons. They searched for it, because every dungeon represented a giant economic opportunity. There was no guarantee what kind of treasures it would spawn. The repair spell it had generated that ruined my income was a good example. </p><p>“And, they need a blacksmith?” I asked. “One that can repair enchanted weapons? Why?” It was obvious with her comment about not changing my perk. </p><p>“The dungeon doesn’t have any mana,” she explained. </p><p>A smile appeared on my face. That changed things. Unlike Health, which was easily replenished by food, mages relied on the mana from their surroundings to replenish it. A cheap, renewable source was why a repair spell had ruined our business. While it took half a day for me to repair an enchanted weapon, they could repair dozens with ease. </p><p>A scale I could never match. </p><p>But, if the dungeon had no mana, it meant that they had to rely on mana potions and other portable sources. And, those methods were expensive, ridiculously so. </p><p>Meaning, I would not only get far more money than I expected, but also I would be an important part of their logistic. The more importance I had, the safer I would be because the fighters would protect me. </p><p>As far as risking my life went, it was a good deal. </p><p>“That sounds like a fascinating deal,” I said. “But, I have two conditions.” She nodded, gesturing me to speak. She didn’t warn me about not having any excessive requests, as I wasn’t a moron. I might be lucky enough that my unique perspective was valuable, but it had limits. </p><p>And, it was safer to leave things on the table than to push excessively. </p><p>“One, I need a small storage room. I need a place to keep my books and other stuff,” I said. </p><p>“Easy.” </p><p>“And, I want you to negotiate with the expedition for me. You can take a ten percent cut from my share,” I added. </p><p>“Oh, interesting,” she said. “Sometimes, I’m forgetting how smart you are. Fifteen percent.” </p><p>“Deal,” I said. As much as I needed money, Rosie’s involvement would help more. Not only did she know the details of the expedition better than I did and could assess the value better, but also it was a way to signal her protection. </p><p>Working with a bunch of people I didn’t recognize, it was better safe than sorry. </p><p>***</p><p>— Chapter 4</p><p>Once my deal with Rosie was done, I didn’t even wait for her confirmation before visiting the workshop to resign and empty my apartment. </p><p>One underrated benefit of Strength, it made moving much easier. No need to call friends and arrange for pizza and beer. And, once I brought things to the storage room Rosie provided at the basement of Broken Tankard, I spent the rest of my time rearranging my books, wondering if I should bring any. </p><p>Ultimately, I decided to pick some scientific journals that were about mechanical engineering and metallurgy, which I had purchased when I had been making good money. They hadn’t been as useful as I had hoped, partially because I lacked the basics. While having one of my bachelor's degrees in Math helped me to understand the gist of the topic easily, ultimately, I wasn’t familiar with the basics of engineering enough to make a difference. </p><p>Though, to be fair, I didn’t really push myself. Back then, I was still confident that my career as a Blacksmith was temporary, a blip before I once again started working as a researcher. </p><p>Now that I was facing another opportunity to make serious money as a blacksmith, I didn’t want to miss my chance. The dungeon without mana was a good opportunity to make some serious cash regardless of what it would produce. </p><p>This time, I planned to make some serious money before the opportunity was gone. </p><p>Naturally, the dungeon would stay there for a long time, but sooner or later, other blacksmiths would join the fray. Perk Reset stone was not unique to me, and it wasn’t my genius that gave me the ability to repair enchanted weapons. It was easy to figure out as long as someone was willing to spend some money. </p><p>The number of blacksmiths capable of it would increase, and as a consequence, the money we could make would go down. Simple supply and demand. </p><p>Once I picked the books I would bring along, I went upstairs to her office. I knocked, and she invited me. </p><p>She wasn’t alone. Two other people were sitting on the other side of her desk, both female. One of them was a redhead, and wore a robe while the other was a blonde and was dressed in a thick chainmail. Their outfits radiated the distinct aura of an enchantment. It was subtle, but working with enchanted weapons for years gave me a good sense of their potential.</p><p>Neither enchantment was weak, but the robe was much stronger than the armor. </p><p>The one with the robe spoke first. “So, you’re the reason we have to take the long road. Merely Level 7, how disappointing,” she commented, which earned a glance from her armored friend … bodyguard. Not for nothing. Using skills like that was considered as rude as just going through someone else’s phone pre-Cataclysm. </p><p>“I presume so. Assuming, of course, the deal is complete,” I answered, not reacting to her rude and obvious attempt to establish control. She was clearly unaware of how much information she had revealed by declaring that. Not only she was rich — identification skills were strategic resources, therefore very expensive — but also she was coddled. The entitled declaration was not just rude, but also it revealed a pretty important secret of her own. </p><p>She reminded me of one of my more entitled students. </p><p>From her wince, I could see that the blonde understood exactly what her companion did but said nothing. It made it more likely that she was a bodyguard rather than a friend. </p><p>“Mostly. You just need to check the details,” Rosie said as she pushed a piece of paper toward me. I read, doing my best to keep my expression neutral, but I wasn’t sure that I succeeded. The deal was good. Too good. </p><p>“I hope that he’s as good as you promised,” the redhead spoke. “If not, I might change my mind about the rest of your promises.” </p><p>“Don’t worry. Ten more blacksmiths that fulfill the conditions, and a hundred warriors, in two weeks. I keep my promises.” </p><p>That explained the generosity of the deal even more. Rosie was using me as some kind of proof of concept. It actually made me feel better about the extremely generous deal. </p><p>Not only I would receive two silver every hour while I was at the repair station regardless of the work, with bonuses based on my success rate and efficiency. That alone was an incredible deal. </p><p>Then, there were additional lines about them supplying me with weapons with different enchantments if they needed me to repair anything other than a simple sharpness enchantment, as well as giving me the right to join the fighting for two hours under the protection of someone called Eleanor to help me level up. </p><p>There was even a line about compensation if I got attacked any other time than my leveling journeys. </p><p>It was a good deal. Too good, even. I looked at Rosie, whose smile looked very soft and friendly. At that moment, I realized that maybe I shouldn’t have just believed that I was lucky. Rosie had another reason for arranging it. </p><p>What, I didn’t know. I was tempted to pull back, but I couldn’t. I got greedy believed myself smart, and swallowed the bait. Now, I needed to deal with the consequences. At least they wouldn’t be deadly. </p><p>Rosie had a weird sense of humor, but she was not malicious … at least to people who didn’t antagonize her. </p><p>“I can’t believe we have to travel all day just to pick up a mere blacksmith,” the redhead muttered. </p><p>“Maria,” the armored one whispered, her tone kind but filled with a warning, no doubt warning her friend about being rude. Amusing. </p><p>“What, I’m right. We have more important things to worry about,” she said. </p><p>“You should have double-checked your calculations, then,” she replied, and the redhead blushed. It gave me a better idea of what was going on. Then, she turned to me. “I’m sorry about Maria, sir. It’s her first time leading an expedition and she’s tense. I’m Eleanor,” she said. </p><p>“Devon,” I said as we shook hands. “I hope that I can help you, but do you mind sharing the details.” </p><p>”Later,” Maria cut in, even more abrasive after she had been admonished. A spoiled student, indeed. Too bad I couldn’t threaten her by dropping her participation score. “We need to be at the camp at dawn. I don’t want to delay the raid any more than necessary.” </p><p>I looked at Rosie once more. She had explicitly mentioned that the dungeon was a week away. She responded with an amused smirk. “See you around, Devon,” she said with a big smirk. “Make sure to hang on tight.” </p><p>Then, it clicked. “We’re going to fly there,” I said, my face getting paler. </p><p>“Is there a problem?” Maria asked. </p><p>“No, just surprised,” I said, not willing to admit my … distaste for the spoiled young woman who was clearly looking for a chance to mock me. It would be unpleasant enough. </p><p>Eleanor seemed to catch the reason, but she just nodded. Not ideal, but better than nothing. </p><p>“Good. Then, let’s go. We have wasted enough time,” Maria declared as she stood up, her gaze locked on Rosie. “Make sure you hold the end of our bargain. You don’t want to cross my family,” she declared, with a hint of threat. </p><p>“Of course not,” Rosie replied, but I didn’t miss the way her smile tightened. Another mistake on Maria’s part. Rosie didn’t like being threatened. But, coming from someone that might as well be a spoiled trust fund kid — or, whatever the equivalent was in our new society — it was easier to shrug off. </p><p>Looking at their maturity, it was hard to believe that they were more or less at the same age, just below twenty-five. Then, I chuckled, realizing that, even in my mind, I sounded ancient rather than my true age, merely thirty-two. </p><p>Starting to work as a professor before my twenties distorted my perspective a bit too much on that. </p><p>“Let’s go,” Maria said as she looked at her bodyguard, and didn’t even look at me. I followed them after putting on my helmet. There was no hiding my identity from anyone relevant, but I rather not be a part of the gossip. </p><p>I followed them to the outskirts of the town and arrived at the gates. According to the laws, the gates were supposed to stay locked all night with no exception. Eleanor didn’t even need to say anything. She just made a gesture, and the guards opened the door, looking nervous. I would have understood if their nervous glance was targeting Maria, but they were looking at Eleanor like that. </p><p>There must be a story behind it, but I didn’t ask. I was too busy psyching myself to the upcoming encounter, wondering about the exact method of flying. The destruction of the technology meant there were no planes or helicopters — good riddance — but the replacements were hardly better. A slew of magical items, starting from flying carpets, replaced them. I never had the money to use them in the first place, so it didn’t matter until now. </p><p>But, when I saw our mode of transportation, I froze. Mounts. Flying mounts. Two griffins, tied to a tree like horses, a glowing shield around them, though whether to keep them captive or to protect them, I didn’t know. </p><p>“Have you ever ridden a Griffin?” Eleanor asked kindly. I shook my head, not in the mood to answer. “I’ll help you,” she said. I followed. The beast looked calm and obedient, not unlike a well-trained horse. I wasn’t scared of it, at least as long as it was on the ground. </p><p>As I climbed behind it, the straps of the saddle moved automatically to wrap around me. “Now, all you need to —” Eleanor started. </p><p>“Enough, we wasted too much time already,” Maria called from the other griffin, and started to fly. </p><p>“Sorry. Just relax and don’t worry. You don’t need to worry. It’s actually very safe,” Eleanor said, which only made my reticence worse. It reminded me of the constant insistence of the flight attendants about how their flying death traps were actually perfectly safe. </p><p>Then, the griffin stretched its wings, and we were in the air. I grabbed the saddle desperately and closed my eyes. It was worse than a plane. At least, there, as long as there was no turbulence, I could convince myself that I wasn’t flying. </p><p>It was impossible here, not with the wind flowing around my face like a whip. Not with every flap of the wings shaking us worse than even the worst tribulation. </p><p>Worse, soon, the cries of monsters reached my ears, interrupted by a sudden flash of red. I couldn’t keep my eyes closed, not with the monsters around us. I watched as Maria casually burning a flying monster that would have killed me instantly. </p><p>I hated my new job already. </p><p>***</p><p>— Chapter 5</p><p>We arrived at the camp at dawn. As much as I hated the necessity to keep my eyes open more than necessary, I forced myself, trying to catch the important details. It was smaller than I expected. A wooden palisade around about twenty wooden buildings, surrounded by double the amount of tents. Also, there was quite a bit of empty space. </p><p>The number of guards I could see on the wall was less than I expected. I could only count a dozen on each wall, each armed with bows, but the safety of the camp suggested that they were stronger than our town guards. </p><p>Even from such a great distance, the quality of their armor was apparent, and each was marked with a stylized griffin. I hoped that it was a guild, and not one of the new houses that was popping out, quick to declare themselves as nobles. </p><p>Three years after the Cataclysm, and the political situation was still in flux. </p><p>The rest of the camp was barely stirring into movement. A quick estimation suggested that there were about three hundred people currently in the camp, including the guard. Less than I expected considering the size of the camp. I assumed that they were at the dungeon. </p><p>That was all I was able to assess until the vertigo hit, forcing me to close my eyes once more. I fought against monsters many times, but still, the heights were my greatest enemy. </p><p>“Finally, we’re here,” Maria called loudly as we landed, stretching her legs. Eleanor helped me to step down. I appreciated her help. I doubted that I would have been able to do so without help. “Hey, are you alright?” Maria asked, noticing my state. </p><p>“Just a cramp. It’s my first time riding a griffin,” I replied, doing my best to be calm and collected. I failed. Luckily, Maria didn’t care about me to care about why I was reacting like that. “Eleanor, let’s go. Father expects a report.” </p><p>“Just a minute. Let me show Devon his workshop first,” she said. Maria didn’t look happy. “The sooner he settles, the sooner he starts working. We need sharpened weapons to move deeper. We’re running low,” she said. </p><p>“Alright, but don’t waste too much time. We still need to lead the team to the dungeon,” she said before moving to the central building. </p><p>While Eleanor led me toward another building, I looked around, trying to catch the movements. “Anything I need to know,” I asked. “We haven’t been able to talk a lot.” </p><p>“There’s nothing too exciting,” she said. “It’s a lower-tier dungeon, populated with some kind of giant beetle with thick armor. The fire magic would have been a good way to deal with them, but the mana density prevents it from being a sustainable solution. But, they have several weak spots. Sharpened methods are the most efficient method of taking them down.” </p><p>“Ah,” I said. Suddenly, I understood the reason for the good contract. Sharpened weapons were cheap — compared to other enchanted weapons, still starting somewhere around fifty silver at a minimum for second-hand ones — and useful, but their durability was their biggest problem. “Their shell degrades the weapon even more, right,” I asked. </p><p>“Worse. They have some kind of secretion that ruins the edge,” she replied. “Even with multiple weapons assigned to each person, it goes slowly. And, we can’t keep going to the nearest town to repair.” </p><p>Understandable, as even with a flying mount, travel wasn’t exactly easy. We didn’t struggle against monsters because Maria was strong enough to deal with them easily. However, it wasn’t exactly smart to assign the top combatant to logistic work. </p><p>Especially there was a limit for the carrying capacity of the griffins. </p><p>“I see,” I replied, considering the implication. The fact that the edge was the part that was being damaged was good news. It was far easier to sharpen a new edge than repair structural damage, which meant that I would be making even more on bonuses than I had initially expected. “How about my work. The contract outlines my job requirements, but nothing else.” </p><p>“You’re going to join our team of blacksmiths. We currently have six capable of repairing enchanted weapons, each with both Analyze and Warm Blow. Seven with your inclusion. There’s also a dozen other apprentices that are working hard to raise their Repair over twenty-five with some disposable weapon so they could join the main work.” </p><p>I frowned, wondering whether I should mention that I didn’t have [Warm Blow] yet, which was a perk that allowed the blacksmiths to repair the enchanted weapons without heating it too much, as it had the risk of destabilizing the enchantment. Then, I decided against it. </p><p>There was no mention of it in the contract, and could the repair in any case. No need to give them useless information that could change their mind. People had weird expectations when it came to Stats and Skills, seemingly determined to ignore that we were not robots, and could easily surpass the limits. </p><p>The lack of Warm Blow didn’t mean I couldn’t keep up with the others. It would be some help, but even without it, I could keep up with the performance requirements outlined in the contract easily. All the tricks I figured out during the three years I spent working overtime were enough. All I needed was to be careful about the heat. </p><p>I didn’t rely entirely on the instincts fed to me by the skills. </p><p>In the end, I decided to stay silent. In the worst case, I could focus on bringing my Repair Skill to the next level. It should take only a few days as long as I was willing to ruin some weapons. </p><p>Eleanor continued to talk, giving me a quick tour of the camp while I watched. “And, this is the forge, where you’ll be working —” she started, only to freeze. </p><p>I assumed the reason was the tall, armored man at the center of the room. He was decked in full plate armor. On his chest, there was the symbol of a griffin like the guards, but it was far more intricate. All of it identified as a high-ranking member of the same group, but another thing commanded my attention. One that was radiating an aura that demanded respect and adulation. </p><p>Charisma. </p><p>I cursed internally. Of all the stats that were brought by the System, I hated Charisma the worst. On the battlefield, it worked wonders, allowing people to fight with a greater focus and coordinate better. In social life, it was disgusting. It was like an airborne drug. </p><p>Luckily, it was a pretty rare stat, and none of them deigned to live in a small town, making sure I never had to deal with them. </p><p>Even without my own prejudices relating to their existence, I could sense that he was bad news from Eleanor’s reaction. Up until now, she had given me the impression of a kind, affable woman despite her very obvious power. </p><p>The moment she saw him, her attitude changed, radiating a dark, dangerous feeling. It was like I was standing next to a giant sword, ready to spill blood. “Sir Thomas, how can this servant help you?” she said, but I had heard people less frustrated being thrown into the garbage. She didn’t bother hiding her hatred. </p><p>“Is this the way a retainer should act, Eleanor? Why are you on your knees?” he said, his smile mocking. His Charisma turned even more pointed, focusing on Eleanor. Her legs trembled, but she resisted it. </p><p>I took a step back, not willing to be affected. I hated the impact of Charisma, especially since the level difference made it very difficult to resist. </p><p>“As the sworn sword of Lady Maria, it’s not appropriate, my lord,” she replied. </p><p>Thomas smiled. “How fun,” he said. “I wonder how long you’ll be able to resist until you beg for me to save you from your grievous mistake.”</p><p>“This humble servant doesn’t deserve your concerns, my lord,” she replied. As I watched them absentmindedly, I couldn’t help but be fascinated by the way culture had changed in merely three years. Centuries of traditions relating to democracy and equality had been abandoned, replaced by a mockery of tribal politics, often with a cursory veneer of medieval nobility. </p><p>I never understood how such a drift could happen in less than a year, which was another reason I had been so enthusiastic about joining the rare research institutes that were finally popping around — only to fail. </p><p>Thomas smirked, no doubt about to follow up with another subtle insult, but his expression changed when Eleanor grabbed her sword. “Don’t worry, Eleanor. We’re old friends. I’m just worried about my dear cousin, and wanted to see if I can help any.” </p><p>“She’s busy, and she doesn’t want to see you,” Eleanor replied. “But, feel free to visit and see if she changes her mind.” </p><p>“Oh, what a pity,” he said, his smugness back. “I’ll just deal with my mission and leave, then,” he said. </p><p>“Your mission,” Eleanor asked. </p><p>“Yes. The family council honored me with an emergency mission of protecting one of the trade routes. And, I’m here to get the necessary resources.” </p><p>Eleanor froze as he passed her a sealed envelope. “No. That’s against the deal. We have been promised no interference.” </p><p>“From our side of the family, and we fulfilled it. We can’t help if the family council assigned me with a critical mission that’s more important than a mere dungeon subjugation.” He smirked as he looked at the blacksmith. “Anyone employed directly by the family, follow me. You have your orders,” he said. </p><p>I watched from the side as the majority of the employees had left the room, leaving only five behind. </p><p>Eleanor followed them, panicked, and the rest of the blacksmiths followed her, no doubt wanting to leave. </p><p>I considered following them but decided against it. I had no idea what would happen, but there were two options. Either the operation was dead, or it would continue. If it continued, getting familiar with the workshop and the weapons would be useful. </p><p>And, if the operation was dead, I better repair a few weapons. Maybe I could push the repair to the next rank before they kick me out. </p><p>After all, even if they failed, the dungeon wouldn’t disappear. Another team would establish a new camp, where I could work. </p><p>Either way, it was better than watching a pointless competition between a bunch of rich kids to finalize. </p><p>***</p>",

    "content": "<p>I had multiple reasons I picked Janassa. The first reason was her personality. She was kind enough to earn the nickname Gentle Rose, almost annoyingly so. She was a hard worker who helped everyone … a fact that was abused by everyone around her, including the servants. </p><p>I dug a while for the reason for it by interrogating the servants under hypnosis, and learned that she was the daughter of the previous master of the valley. However, once he died, the valley was taken over by his disciple, who immediately sidelined her to tend to the spiritual garden while finding reasons to delay her training in alchemy. Apparently, she wasn’t very much liked because her mother was a foreigner. </p><p>Saying that cultivators were conservative was an understatement. </p><p>The second reason was the convenience. She had lived at the edge of the valley, which was close to the Misty Mountains. All I needed was to create a fate trail, and hypnotize a few servants to ‘remember’ her leaving the valley. </p><p>Then, her current power level was also helpful. She was already Sixth Stage of Qi Gathering, which meant a decent return even before she could breakthrough further. She already had extensive knowledge of tending spiritual plants, and some limited knowledge of alchemy that she learned before her father’s passing. </p><p>Altogether, she was the perfect target. I created a fake mist before I burst into the garden she had been tending, creating several weird lights and a mystic voice. “You are a good seedling. You have the potential to inherit master’s legacy,” I called as I snapped my fingers, creating a light effect. </p><p>“W-what’s going on,” she gasped before she fell unconscious. I picked her up and brought her to the flying boat. </p><p>“I’m getting too good at kidnapping people. That’s not a good sign,” I muttered as I started controlling the boat. I returned to the outskirts of Markas in quick order. I placed her on the hill I had created for alchemy training, with multiple books and materials already placed. </p><p>Then, I placed a stolen cauldron in front of her. Most of the setup had already been in place thanks to Aisnam’s training session, but I added a few mysterious lights and smoke effects outside the formation, including an illusion effect. </p><p>I wanted her to believe that we were in a mystic land. </p><p>For that purpose, I created a wall of light, and filled it with a few mysterious poems that essentially implied that she had been selected to inherit the legacy of an alchemy king, but she needed to prove herself first. </p><p>All vague, but still believable. Frankly, that part wasn’t a challenge. A lot of cultivators were ready to believe the existence of such pockets, especially when they came with near-infinite Qi and techniques. </p><p>The challenge was to find someone who would help an ‘unlucky candidate’ out of pity rather than seeking benefits. Janassa seemed to fulfill those conditions well enough. </p><p>I stayed hidden as she stirred awake, her expression filled with shock. “W-what’s going on?” she shouted as she looked around, stopping only when she noticed the glowing wall of text. She stopped to read it, her expression flickering. </p><p>Only then, I really paid attention to the way she looked. It was easy to describe her as an exotic beauty. She had beautiful caramel skin, and her curves were … impressive. However, I didn’t pay much attention to those details, soon focusing on the expression on her beautiful face. </p><p>It settled somewhere between worry and excitement rather than disbelief, I chose the way I looked accordingly. I chose to dress as a handsome yet unfortunate servant. </p><p>“Hello, mistress,” I called her even as I appeared from the mist. </p><p>“Mistress? What mistress? Who are you?” she gasped, looking shocked. </p><p>“I’m just an unfortunate soul that had failed in my challenge, mistress,” I said, bowing shamelessly. “Now, I can only serve the candidates for the inheritance in order to be freed.” </p><p>“T-that’s horrible,” she gasped. </p><p>“It’s nothing less than this talentless one deserves, mistress,” I replied. “May I guide you to your challenge, or would you prefer someone better…” The character I was playing was a bit exaggerated, but from her expression, I could see that it was working. </p><p>Excellent. </p><p>“No, no, no!” she gasped, panicked. “You will be able to help excellently.” </p><p>“Excellent, mistress,” I said even as I bowed down. “Now, let me go over the rules. Every time you make significant progress in your cultivation or your alchemy skills, you’ll earn a number of points. Then, you can use those points to purchase many things. Certain comforts, combat techniques, maybe even,” I explained. </p><p>“Can I buy your freedom?” she asked. I barely held back a smile. I truly chose the right personality type to support me. </p><p>“Unfortunately, no, mistress. To do that, I need to collect my own points. Unfortunately, I’m not skilled in alchemy for it.” </p><p>“Maybe I can teach you?” she said. </p><p>“I … I can’t pay you back, mistress. Anything you receive is strictly controlled by the rules of the mystic land. I don’t have the right to make an exception,” I said, making sure to remove any expectation for waiting for a reward. </p><p>It should be enough to satisfy the rules of the System. </p><p>“Doesn’t matter. Your imprisonment is wrong. I’ll help you,” she said. </p><p>“I … I don’t know what to say, mistress,” I said, bowing even deeper. “But, first, let me bring you the materials you require to practice your alchemy.” </p><p>“Let me help you,” she said.</p><p>I stopped her with a gesture, a reluctant expression on my face. “Unfortunately, you’re not allowed to leave the designated area during the testing, mistress. The rules. Maybe you can start reading the techniques available for you while I collect the material.” </p><p>Her naivety was even more intense than the rumors had suggested. No wonder even the servants dared to swindle her. </p><p>I quickly visited the garden, and collected a huge amount of spirit plants that could support the refinement of the basic pills. Luckily, I had already received an alchemy lesson that gave me enough information to handle the basic preparation steps with great speed. </p><p>That information didn’t come together with recipes, but raiding the libraries of the alchemists solved that problem. Learning the recipes enough to be able to produce them would take some time, but material preparation was much simpler. Especially since I could use my cultivation techniques. The dagger techniques, in particular, were very useful, allowing me to cut and dice piles of plants with an eerie accuracy. </p><p>I returned her with a large bag of materials, enough to make a hundred attempts each for six common pill recipes, as well as handwritten copies of the recipes themselves. “Are they the materials?” she asked. </p><p>“Yes, mistress. The first test is to create a Peak Profound Grade pill in less than a month,” I said. The timeline was a bit tight, but considering all the advantages I gave to her, certainly doable. “There’s a sequence you have to follow. The martial talent pill is the first one. The recovery pill is the second. Then, there’s the meridian cleansing pill. The last three, you can choose as you wish.” </p><p>“I already know how to make two of them, so it shouldn’t be too difficult,” she said as she moved toward the cauldron. “Where’s the fire?” </p><p>“Let me show you, mistress,” I said, showing her how to activate the formation I had created to supply flames, and how to adjust it.</p><p>“It’s incredible,” she said as she played around. “Too bad that the cauldron can’t handle too much fire.” </p><p>“It’s a part of the test, mistress. You’ll have a chance to get a better cauldron,” I said. She would, as soon as I would have a chance to get one, and arrange things so that she could gift me her old one. “Should I leave? I don’t want to peer into your secrets.” </p><p>“Nonsense. Come here. I’ll teach you at the same time. No need to waste time.” </p><p>“Thank you, mistress,” I said as I bowed. “But first, may I ask you a few questions about how to tend to spirit plants.” </p><p>“Sure, go ahead,” she said. I asked a few, which turned into a quick lesson, which then turned into a lesson on essence plants when I realized she was also a decent apothecary. When it ended, a notification appeared. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 30; Pity Bonus - 40 (Capped)]</p><p>[70x Return - Spirit Plant Care Lesson - Minor Immersion]</p><p>[70x Return - Rotlaska Apothecary Technique Lesson - Beginner, Minor Immersion]</p><p>Excellent, I thought. It had gone far easier than I had expected. However, it was curious why spirit plant care was an independent skill, while essence plants came as a a part of apothecary education. A mysterious distinction. </p><p>But, it was just a curiosity. The real benefit was seeing that the System triggered perfectly. </p><p>“Now, let me teach you my alchemy technique,” she said. </p><p>“Is there a name for it, mistress?” I asked. </p><p>“No, it’s just a style my mother taught me,” she replied. “She never shared the name before her… Anyway. Listen carefully…” </p><p>With that, she started an intense lesson that taught me a lot. The beginner parts, we skipped relatively quickly once I showed my expertise in basics. After all, while Minor Familiarity was decent as far as alchemy went. Truthfully, based on the explanation of the servants, I was expecting her to be somewhere at that at most. </p><p>But, the more I revealed that I understood, the more detailed her class had turned. She was significantly better than Minor Familiarity. I guessed that she was somewhere around Minor Accomplishment, which was incredible for a cultivator who wasn’t even from a proper cultivation family. </p><p>I couldn’t help but feel excited for the reward I would receive. The lesson was detailed enough, and more importantly, she was patient enough to keep going for eight uninterrupted hours. Reaching Perfection was a given, and even a higher level was possible.</p><p>“I think that’s enough for today,” she called as she finished refining the third pill. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 30; Pity Bonus - 40 (Capped)]</p><p>[70x Return - Kartpa Alchemy Technique Lesson - Beginner]</p><p>[70x Return - Martial Talent Pill Recipe - Black Medium-Grade]</p><p>The rewards had been interesting. The alchemy reward had been far lower than I expected, but instead of confusing me, it filled me with a sense of fear. All because of one little word that was before Alchemy Technique. </p><p>Kartpa. </p><p>“T-thank you, mistress,” I said, stammering as I moved away, hoping that it would be assumed as gratitude. </p><p>I had a nasty surprise I needed to ponder upon. </p><p></p>",

    "content": "<p>The Fortuitous Encounter with the cultivator that might very well be in the legendary Nascent Soul Realm had been significant. </p><p>The biggest impact was to confirm my earlier guesses about fate and providence. I had already been suspecting that some kind of mystic energy was manipulating some of my encounters. That ephemeral sensation driving me to the stall had just confirmed it. </p><p>However, while the encounter had been beneficial, it hadn’t been without its risks. I had no doubt that, if the cultivator had caught even a portion of the secrets I had been hiding, I wouldn’t have met with a fortunate end. </p><p>It confirmed the existence of providence, but it was too early to assume that it was a completely benign one. </p><p>However, regardless of its nature, fate forced me to change my plans in many ways. Some of those ways were practical. I readily abandoned the desire to check the stone gate, not just at the capital of Linnass, but all of them. </p><p>While fear had played a role in the decision, it wasn’t the only reason. The newest treasure I had in my inventory played a big role as well. A heaven-rank ginseng could enhance my already high martial talent even more.</p><p>It created some new options. </p><p>If it was just a couple days ago, I wouldn’t have cared about increasing my martial arts talents slightest. It was already high enough that I could master them to the limit by working a few days, not to mention their benefits had been limited when compared to Qi cultivation. </p><p>The secrets of Everdawn Martial Arts had changed that equation. Not only did they have a growth potential enough to potentially rival Golden Core, but also they were not recognized by the System, meaning they had the potential to grow without jeopardizing my returns. </p><p>Just a possibility was enough to make me work hard. </p><p>If I just wanted to learn them, my talent was still more than enough. Unfortunately, I couldn’t just learn Everdawn Saber, as everything I had learned about them was shouting that there was a huge trap buried in it. </p><p>I either needed to understand and decipher the techniques enough to remove that trap, or develop new martial arts relying on similar principles that wouldn’t trigger the System. </p><p>“Like I didn’t have enough to do,” I muttered even as I returned to Markas, and created multiple formations, testing the merits of visiting the alchemists I had learned from my prisoner, to see if I could improve my abilities. While I could consume the ginseng directly, its effectiveness would be far higher if I could refine it to a pill before. </p><p>Looking purely from a time investment perspective, devouring the Heaven High-Grade ginseng made sense. It would probably transform my talent enough to solve the challenge in front of me. But, one fact stopped me. </p><p>Even if I could learn the technique, would it be enough? While I didn’t have any conclusive evidence, I had enough supporting evidence to know that the number and the general strength of the practitioners were important for Everdawn Arts — and possibly the other martial arts — so I might need to raise a great number of martial artists of Second Grade, maybe even the First Grade to really benefit from it.</p><p>A tempting idea, particularly since I still had no idea about the true nature of the brewing disaster. When presented with a choice,, I much rather help the ‘brave warriors’ to defend their homelands while I hung around like a wise old wizard. </p><p>Then, thanks to my spiritual plant-tending knowledge, an idea popped into my mind. There were certain techniques that could use the aura of a stronger plant to boost the growth of plants of the same type. While it had certain drawbacks, those might be somehow limited by spending an excess amount of Qi … which I had in abundance. </p><p>“But first, let’s see if the idea is viable,” I muttered even as I stopped by the spiritual plant garden, harvested enough essence plants and Qi plants to act as a fertilizer, and moved to the spirit vein. </p><p>Only after arriving next to the spirit vein, and creating a shocking amount of formations both geared to cut any kind of aura and fill the garden with an excessive amount of Qi. Then, I used my extensive apothecary and budding alchemy knowledge to create a very nutritious farmland. Only when the preparations were complete, did I pull it from my inventory. </p><p>I didn’t want to take any risk for my first Heaven Rank treasure, even if it was an ugly root plant. </p><p>A good choice, as the moment I pulled it out, a soft, comforting growth radiated from the spiritual plant. The difference was hard to describe. It was somehow … more. The effect wasn’t as strong as the glow that occurred whenever pushing above Perfection, nor it was exactly the same, but it was nonetheless fascinating. </p><p>I was glad that I was patient enough to keep it in my inventory until I was under formations. I had no doubt that its presence would have triggered another commotion. And, this time, I wouldn’t have the time to create another fake mystic land, because a lot of cultivators were already here. </p><p>“Fascinating,” I muttered even as I planted it at the center of the garden. It devoured nutrition out of the ground hungrily, but luckily, the formations were in place to replace it. Soon, it was radiating Qi to a great degree. </p><p>Nice, as I wasn’t entirely sure if it was a Spirit plant or an essence plant. But then, maybe the distinction wasn’t as strict when it came to plants. Even with all my knowledge, I was still scratching the depths of the truth. </p><p>The next was the Black Rank ginseng which had been my original gift. Instead of planting it, I put that in a special formation, forcibly maturing it. In most circumstances, it was not a smart decision, as not only did it affect the seed quality somewhat, but also it destroyed the vitality of the original plant, making it useless. </p><p>For me, it was a necessary sacrifice. Instead, I had carefully planted the newly acquired seeds, carefully setting them across the huge garden I had prepared. Just like that, I had hundreds of potential ginseng seeds, that would reach at least Peak Yellow-Grade. </p><p>As the glow from the Heaven Rank ginseng spread, they started germinating even faster than I expected them to. “No, Black Low-Grade at a minimum,” I corrected my assumption. They were devouring Qi even more hungrily, but I was happy with it. It wasn’t like I was using most of the Qi that the spirit vein could generate, wasting its potential. </p><p>A hypercharged garden specialized for the plants that supported Martial Arts talent was exactly what I needed. It had many strategic implications. And, since they were new plants, they wouldn’t count as gifts, and I might actually find a way to recycle through the System. </p><p>I just needed to find someone who would generously gift me a few Black Grade ginsengs. But that was for the future. </p><p>First, I needed to find a way to enhance my Alchemy. Sitting down and learning was not an option. Studying like that required years to improve even if I had the talent … which I did not. Not only I needed to find someone who was not only competent in Alchemy, but also gullible enough to help me enthusiastically. </p><p>It was even more important than their strength. With my current resources, I could easily help them rise to the top of the Ninth Grade Qi Gathering to ensure a decent benefit, but they needed to be softhearted to the point of being gullible. </p><p>Luckily, the list given to me by my prisoner had provided me a good list of targets to leverage. Eight different alchemists of Qi Gathering rank, each open for business. I visited them one by one, which, even with my flying boat, took a day. Most of the time had been spent observing. </p><p>Admittedly, it might have taken a lot longer, but luckily, their defensive formations and other measures meant nothing. </p><p>Every alchemist had a similar setup. A small village that was located in a very obscure location near the misty mountains — usually depths of a valley or a mountaintop — with a large garden to supply them with Qi. Though, they were rich enough that they wouldn’t miss a broken cauldron or two. Not to mention, copying their available knowledge.</p><p>All of them had defensive formations, but calling them amateurish was a compliment. Mostly, they relied on old formation disks to support a basic concealment and detection formula, and nothing else. Some of them lived alone, while others had a team of martial artists working for them as farmers. </p><p> Observing them, I was able to see that none of the lead alchemists was a good candidate for the operation I had in mind. Not because they were violent and evil, but because they were cunning. It was inevitable. All eight of them had been able to survive while operating an alchemy business serving rogue cultivators, somehow managing to stay in operation. </p><p>Amusingly, even the information I had received from my prisoner hadn’t led me to the correct location most of the time, instead leading me to some kind of hidden store. Only with my abilities, I was able to track their home base. </p><p>Soon, however, I found a candidate. A young woman called Janassa… </p>",

    "content": "<p>After leaving the cell, I found myself unsure of what to do. Technically, I had three directions: exploring the Misty Mountains, investigating the Treasure Pavilion, and trying to have a talk with one of the imprisoned beings. </p><p>Unfortunately, all three options were fraught with dangers that could threaten even me. The dangers of exploring the mist were obvious. While it was filled with treasures, it was also filled with dangerous monsters — and possibly more — that would make going deeper a challenge. And, that was discounting the fact that the mist had some kind of sentience behind it. </p><p>A land filled with monsters and a sentient mist … I wasn’t ready to go any deeper than the outskirts yet. </p><p>Investigating the Treasure Pavilion seemed to be equally scary. For their existence to be untouched despite interfering with a topic that the other sects clearly wanted to suppress while selling that many valuable items, their strength was clearly not to be underestimated. </p><p>It looked like a confrontation with one of those imprisoned beings was the best idea. Of the three options, they were the least scariest ones, their strength clearly depleted during their long imprisonment. Moreover, their prisons had already been sabotaged by the other cultivators, and even if the worst happened and they escaped, no one would be searching for me. </p><p>With that in mind, I traveled toward the Linnass Kingdom. It was the perfect target for multiple reasons. For one, it was still at war with Zaim, so it was a good target to visit for some revenge for all the trouble they had created for my beautiful Aisnam. Then, it was the proximity to the spirit vein, which meant I could still use the limitless Qi from the vein in case of a troubling event. </p><p>Then, there was the fact that their stone gate had been sabotaged as well, meaning any further intervention easier to hide. </p><p>The Linnass capital was an impressive city. Its outer walls were tall and weathered, filled with martial artists to create an intimidating sight. However, their walls were pristine, showing that the growing war of the mortal domain was yet to reach their capital.</p><p>But, that didn’t mean that they weren’t aware of the risks. Every gate had been guarded by a platoon of martial artists, checking every visitor carefully to prevent a problem. </p><p>Unfortunately for them, neither their tall walls nor their valiant martial artists could keep me away. It didn’t even slow me down. I could have gone to the stone gate that was under the palace easily, but instead, I decided to walk the markets, particularly toward the auction house, curious if I could find anything valuable. </p><p>For that purpose, I made sure to change once more. Once again, I was dressed as a young valiant martial artist who had been injured, ready to claim that I had suffered a dangerous injury that ruined me while I was fighting for Linnass. It was a good way to make people pity me despite the circumstances. </p><p>Unfortunately, there wasn’t anything that was worth the effort that would trigger the System. For that reason, I decided to treat it as a stroll, enjoying the grandeur of the capital like a tourist. </p><p>Technically, Linnass was enemy territory, but I didn’t let that ruin my perspective. Ultimately, the mortals filling the city were the victims of the circumstances. Even back on Earth, it was not easy to stop the greedy government people from doing something. </p><p>And, back then, politicians couldn’t kill hundreds of people just with their bare fist. </p><p>I walked among the people, enjoying the stalls displaying wares of all kinds, some rusty with time, some glistening as people tried to turn their wealth into something more useful. A good reminder of why this time I didn’t choose to stand as a bystander, but actively fought. </p><p>I took a deep breath, walking forward when … a strange feeling settled on me. It felt almost like being drunk, but it was not. It was something different. An ephemeral feeling, difficult to notice and easy to ignore. If I didn’t have the absolute confidence to get away even if the worst happened, I would have been too scared to follow it. </p><p>As long as I stayed in the range of the spirit vein, I was invincible below Golden Core. </p><p>The sensation had been weird and ephemeral, and soon, I found myself standing in front of an old man with a stall that was filled with various useless sundries. An old, affable old man with a long beard, who looked pitiful and dignified at the same time. </p><p>Suddenly, I was very glad that I hadn’t removed the formation I had designed to keep myself concealed. The reason was simple. I could sense a slight aura of Qi around the old man. A cultivator, but that wasn’t the problem. </p><p>No, the problem was that the only reason I could even feel his presence was because I was right next to him, and my Meditation skills had been raised past Perfection. A part of me wished that I couldn’t feel his Qi, as it wasn’t the soft and loose Qi of a Foundation Establishment cultivator, but it was tight and condensed. </p><p>A Golden Core cultivator. </p><p>It took all I had not to run away. I had already walked close enough to be dangerous, and while trying to commit to a first strike would benefit me, it would only be a limited help. I had already drifted into a troubling situation. </p><p>“A customer. How interesting,” he said even as he chuckled, looking at me. I felt the probing of his Qi. Luckily, he only used a soft probing, which didn’t break my formation. He seemed convinced of my status. I was tempted to absorb his Qi to see if it could trigger the System, but I didn’t dare to. He had excellent control and no leakage. I didn’t want to alert him. </p><p>The same was true for trying to play him. Getting away safely was more important. “I’m just looking around, honored elder,” I replied gently yet proudly, playing the role of the honorable yet injured martial artist. I even added a bow, which, while traditionally acceptable, was seldom given by martial artists to civilians. </p><p>“What a kind young man,” the old man chuckled. “Many just ignore a useless old man like me.” </p><p>“A young tree may reach for the sky, but its roots drink from the wisdom of the old forest,” I replied, once again tapping the benefits of the language jade I had acquired long ago, playing the poetry angle. Hopefully, it would be enough. </p><p>He chuckled again. “How true, but not many young people care about their elders, or the ancient arts,” he replied. But, I could hear the melancholy in his tone. Clearly, his presence here had a story. What, I had no idea, nor I was ready to probe. </p><p>“It’s a disgrace,” I replied, agreeing with him readily. Playing to the personality of the weird old man seemed like a good idea. We chatted for a few minutes before I bowed. “I better not hold you from your work, honored elder,” I said as I bowed again. </p><p>As for the items he was selling, I didn’t buy any. They all seemed like useless garbage, and while they might actually be valuable, I decided that it was not necessary. </p><p>“Good, but before leaving, take this,” he said as he reached for his pocket, and passed me a small, ugly root. “A gift from your elder. I found it accidentally. It might help you with your injury.” </p><p>“Thank you, elder,” I said as I grabbed it, acting like I didn’t understand the value of it. But, as an apothecary, there was no mistaking its value. </p><p>A ginseng. One that was valuable enough to reach Black Grade. Probably at least Black High-Grade, but I needed to break the subtle Qi shield around it to truly assess it. To any martial artist, it would have looked like an ordinary essence plant. </p><p>I didn’t dare to offer payment, accepting the favor, which made him smile gently. It would probably create a karmic tie between us — which, at this point, I didn’t doubt of its existence despite still knowing very little — but at this point, trying to refuse it was riskier. </p><p>Also, it would be a lie to say I wasn’t greedy. The essence ginseng was not just a herb, but a true treasure of Earth that could increase martial talent, which was very difficult to grow, and even more difficult to raise above Profound Grade. A Yellow Grade one would have been useless for me, and even a Black Grade one would have limited benefits. </p><p>But, I wasn’t limited to Black Grade. Depending on the multiplier, I might be lucky enough to get one at legendary Earth grade. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 320; Pity Bonus - 5]</p><p>[325x Return - Seven Colored Ginseng - Heaven Low-Grade]</p><p>The multiplier was enough to make my eyes widen. Either the System multiplier changed when the gift giver was at Golden Core, or his realm was above Golden Core. A Nascent Soul elder. </p><p>At least the amount of pity implied that my presence was nothing more than a passing fancy. I bowed again and walked away. Once I was at a distance, he pulled his Qi around, blocking himself from my view. If I was a martial artist like I showed, I wouldn’t see anything. So, when I looked back, I displayed an appropriate amount of shock as I caressed the ginseng in my hand. </p><p>It looked like I had real a Fortuitous Immortal Encounter. </p><p>How fascinating… </p>",

    "content": "<p>I finished repairing another sword, and reached to my left, and pressed a button, triggering the primitive feeder I had constructed. When it had been dropped to just below three minutes, walking to the damaged pile to pick a new weapon was actually slowing me down, especially when the first fifteen seconds were waiting for the sword to warm up. </p><p>The feeder not only brought the sword closer but also placed it at the edge of the forge so it started to warm up properly while I finished polishing up the sword in hand. </p><p>That, with the other improvements, allowed me to drop the Repair time to three minutes. “Assuming, of course, this stupid device stops malfunctioning,” I muttered even as I turned to the side. There had been some trouble with the feeder despite its simple mechanical structure. </p><p>It was harder to make things without the convenient schematics from the System. </p><p>However, when I looked at the machine, I noticed something different. It didn’t feed, because there weren’t any. The swords had been repaired. All of them. </p><p>“Well, that was faster than I expected,” I muttered. It had been barely five days since arrival, and not only I was able to meet the daily consumption but also finished the backlog. Of course, that was only because the dungeon operations had been slowed down to a crawl once Thomas took away their best fighters. Once the new recruits arrived, I wouldn’t be able to meet the demand alone. Still, it was a fascinating achievement. </p><p>If I played it well, I could get some more concessions from Eleanor, who was mostly responsible for running the camp despite the fact that Maria was supposed to be the leader. A dynamic that I started to get familiar with since I had been invited to their dinners regularly. </p><p>Technically, I could bypass Eleanor and ask Maria directly. She was much more careless when it came to financial matters — one disadvantage of a privileged upbringing — which meant she would be even more generous. However, I ignored that temptation. Doing so would sour Eleanor’s feelings. Maria might have warmed up to me, but I doubted that it was to the point of ignoring her best friend’s negative suggestions. </p><p>No, I wouldn’t take that risk for some extra reward. </p><p>Especially since my hard work came with some incredible rewards of its own that made any payment from them just a bonus. </p><p>[Blacksmith - Level 22]</p><p>[Health 660/660]</p><p>[Vitality 44 / Strength 44 / Dexterity 22]</p><p>[Skills (3/8)</p><p>Repair (Common) - 36 [Inspect]</p><p>Forge (Common) - 23 [Intuitive Forging]</p><p>Hammer of Might (Uncommon) - 7]</p><p>My repair had increased by another ten points as I had worked on the swords, which played a role in my increased performance. Too bad it was already slowing down. Today, I merely gained a point for Repair. The benefit to the new process was slowing down, which meant would probably need weeks, maybe even months to reach fifty points. </p><p>Then, I chuckled. “It didn’t take long for me to get greedy, did it,” I muttered. Just a week ago, I was expecting it to take a month to just improve from twenty-four to twenty-five, and now, I was looking for a similar timeframe to reach the next threshold and feeling it was too long. </p><p>The sensation of getting better in three days in a way that should have required years of work was truly addictive. The increased skill not only gave me a better instinctive of the tool, but also more information. </p><p>However, I wished that information was freely available rather than triggering when required. </p><p>“Now, what to do?” I muttered. My Forge skill was yet to clear the threshold, but unlike Repair, it had been intentional. I had been hoping to do some research and see if I could find something about the conditions to trigger the unusual perk. </p><p>I didn’t ask Eleanor or Maria about it. Even if they knew such a thing was possible, I doubted that they would know the conditions to trigger it for Blacksmiths. They were not really interested in the process, just the results. </p><p>And, if they didn’t know, such information might make me an even more of a target. </p><p>Maybe I was paranoid about not revealing it. It was entirely likely that Eleanor would confirm that it was a well-known fact among warriors of their calibers. </p><p>But there were too many ways it could go wrong, and I had already achieved too much, which potentially turned me into a target. I didn’t want to push my luck too much. </p><p>That left two options. I would either waste time trying to read the same dozen journals on material science, hoping to learn some more … or I would take the risk to push the Forge into the next threshold. </p><p>Pushing myself to the next stage would have been simple. Just by forging three more daggers, I would reach there. But, I was starting to have a different plan. One that depended on whether Maria would trust me enough to let me borrow an item from her. </p><p>Or even trust enough to reveal whether she had one in the first place. </p><p>The enchantments like sharpness, piercing, and resistance were relatively common. The System Shops held them in abundance. But, there was also much rarer equipment that increased Health and Mana capacity, which were invaluable for anyone fighting in the field. </p><p>There were also rumors of items that directly increased Stats … but they were merely rumors. Their existence certainly made sense, but ironically, it made it even harder to guess whether they were real or not. Even if they existed, they would inevitably be too valuable even to borrow, and I couldn’t ask for them. </p><p>Luckily, for my plan, I didn’t need to ask for that. Just an item to increase Mana would be more than enough to test my theory. If it worked, excellent. If not, I wouldn’t lose anything. </p><p>I just needed to wait for the next dinner to probe for the opportunity. </p><p>But, in the meantime, I wasn’t planning to waste time. I grabbed a sword with sharp enchantment. It wasn’t made of the mysterious bronze alloy, but a more ordinary type of iron, the kind that many people had. </p><p>I had purchased it from one of the guards, paying forty silvers for it. It would have been a steal if it wasn’t for its significantly damaged state. It wasn’t just the blade that was damaged, but also the enchantment, making it far less efficient. Forty silver was a significant overpay. </p><p>However, considering that I couldn’t risk ruining the bronze swords without annoying Eleanor, it was a good trade. For the last two days, I have been using my Inspect perk on it repeatedly, trying to get a better sense of how Enchantments worked. </p><p>I had been working on it for two days, poking and prodding the enchantment to understand how it worked, but there had been no benefit. To be fair, even claiming that I had been playing around the enchantment was a better way to define it. I had no ability to manipulate the enchantment itself, so I had been deliberately breaking and repairing the metal, trying to get a better sense of how the enchantment worked. </p><p>I had spent quite a bit of time on it, and all I achieved was to weaken the enchantment even further. I felt like a caveman repeatedly banging a computer case hoping to learn how it was made. </p><p>But, I had to start somewhere. And, the caveman banging on a computer might have better luck if he could get a real-time view of all the internals. Every little bit counted. </p><p>I was lost in my thoughts when the door opened. I looked up, expecting Eleanor, bringing another batch of swords to repair. Instead, it was Maria. “Hello, boss,” I greeted her cheerfully. </p><p>“Did I finally catch you wasting time while working?” she asked, far too happy to do so. </p><p>I chuckled. My cheer was not just about the opportunity to ask for a chance to borrow her items. It was genuinely amusing to see her longing for a chance to tease me. Not due to any malice, but because for once, she wanted to be on the other side of the experience. Mostly, it was Eleanor trying to convince her to be more responsible and hardworking. </p><p>“Unfortunately, not the case, boss. I run out of swords to repair,” I replied, more than happy to crush that particular hope, earning a cute pout back. </p><p>“Good, then I don’t need to plan anything before we go for another leveling trip. Let’s go.” </p><p>“Right now? We don’t have much time until the evening,” I commented. “Factoring in the flight time, we will have less than an hour. Do you think it’s worth it?” </p><p> Maria shrugged. “Maybe, but I have just finished dealing with that annoying woman, and I don’t have anything else to do. Since you don’t have any work as well, why not use it. Or are you afraid of losing again, professor?” </p><p>“Never,” I said, playing to her hobby of demolishing me in chess. “However, I have some experiments to run before the recruits arrive…” I started, knowing that she would ignore that. “Actually, since you’re here, I have a quick thing to ask.” </p><p>“Go ahead,” she said. </p><p>“May I borrow one of your items, ones that grant Mana? I have a feeling that, by using it, I might actually figure a trick to bypass it.” </p><p>“No,” she said, her smile gone. </p><p>“Sorry if it was too much to ask,” I quickly said, not wanting to annoy her too much. </p><p>She shook her head rapidly. “No, that’s not it,” she said. “I said no because it wouldn’t work. Any items that grant additional Stats or Mana only work up to a percentage of the existing state,” she said. </p><p>“Meaning, it won’t work if you don’t have the original stat. I see,” I said, unable to hide my frustration. I had been very hopeful about that fact. </p><p>“Sorry about it,” she said. </p><p>“Not your fault,” I answered. It wasn’t like she was the one that decided how the System worked. Still, it was frustrating to see the plans I had worked for during the last few days had been ruined because of one detail. One that was quite common in her circles if the ease she revealed that was any indicator, along with confirming the existence of Stat boosting items. </p><p>“I can try to help, I don’t have anything to do,” she offered, no doubt taking pity on my mood. </p><p>I was about to refuse … but then, I changed my mind. It might not work … but then, it might. </p><p>“That would be excellent, boss,” I said with a big smile. </p>",

    "content": "<p>When the evening finally arrived, I had no plans other than eating before collapsing to my bed. My day had been incredibly productive, but also exhausting. I just needed to sleep, wake up early, and come up with a new proposal that would convince Eleanor to provide me with more ingots to improve my Forge skill further. </p><p>I could probably excuse the disappearance of a few bronze ingots by failures and experiments, but I couldn’t use all of them easily. </p><p>But, those plans died when the workshop door opened and Eleanor walked in. “Lady Maria asks you to join us for dinner,” she said, her voice kind, but I didn’t miss the subtle threat in her tone like it was my fault. I had a sense of what was about to follow, so I decided to distract her. </p><p>“Does she want to listen to my report directly? Good, I have news,” I said, quick to distract her with a lengthy explanation of my improvements until her gaze became glassy. “In summary, I managed to reduce the repair time for a further three minutes toward the end.” </p><p>“Impressive, very impressive,” she said as she looked at me. “I didn’t know Blacksmiths could do that.” </p><p>“We don’t, because everyone is happy using their skills without changing anything,” I replied, unable to suppress a genuine flicker of anger. ”I understand why the quick improvement of the skills was more tempting. I use them to great effect as well. But embracing them to the point of everything we had learned while establishing the civilization is absurd.” </p><p> I didn’t expect her expression to tighten. “Don’t tell me you’re one of them. I should have known,” she said, her attitude once again radiating the same sharpness she had revealed when she had faced Thomas. It was good good news. </p><p>I raised my hand in surrender. “I feel like there’s a misunderstanding,” I said calmly. “Who are … them?” </p><p>My surprise must have looked genuine because she calmed down. “You know, the Purists,” she said. </p><p>“I have no idea who they are,” I replied. “From the context, I’m guessing it’s some kind of political movement or a cult. But, I have been living in a godforsaken small town since the Cataclysm, and apparently, we’re not important enough for them.” </p><p>She looked at me carefully, trying to see if I was lying. Soon, the sense of sharpness disappeared, suggesting that she believed me. “They are not a political movement,” she spat. “They are a bunch of terrorists and murderers that believe that the System is some kind of curse that drains us completely. They are trying to kill everyone with the System, believing that by killing enough people, the System will disappear, and we can go back to civilization.” </p><p>“What a bunch of morons,” I spat out. “Even if they were right, what do think will happen when the whole infrastructure disappears once again. Just more deaths. Unfortunately, Einstein was right when he declared that human stupidity is limitless.” </p><p>“Good. I would have hated to kill you,” Eleanor replied. I gave her a shaky smile. Being threatened by summary execution was not a fun time. I understood where she was coming from, but that didn’t mean I enjoyed it. </p><p>“Now that we resolved that minor misunderstanding,” I started, proud that I kept my voice from trembling. “You mentioned dinner.” </p><p>“Yes, follow me,” she said. </p><p>“So, I have a question about the supplies,” I said. “I believe I can improve the repair time even more, but I need to experiment some more.” </p><p>“What do you need?” she asked. </p><p>“I still need the books about material science if possible. More information is always helpful,” I said. If it wasn’t for the tricky subject matter, I would have questioned her why asking for old books didn’t trigger her suspicions, but praising the civilization did … but then, a viable answer popped up. Considering those Purists assumed mass murder was a good way to bring back civilization, I was sure that they didn’t bother working on the other part. </p><p>Another unreasonable cult, this time idolizing the past rather than a religion or a cult leader. </p><p>“I’ll try to prioritize it,” she answered. “What else?” </p><p>“I need to use the ingots during those experiments, and some of them will be wasted. I need your permission to use them. Also, having more materials and different types of weapons will be helpful as well. Maybe even some with different types of enchanted weapons. Dungeon products will be useful as well.” </p><p>“Ingots is easy. We already have an excess of dungeon products. Ingots are a bit more problematic. We have some in excess, especially with your new repair method, and you can use one on ingot for every ten weapons you repair,” she offered. “But, that means you’ll receive your salary and bonuses based on the original contract.” </p><p>“That works,” I said. While I wouldn’t say no to more money, I was more enthusiastic about experimentation. “And, one last thing,” I asked. </p><p>“That list is getting a bit long,” she said. </p><p>“All of them are mutually beneficial,” I said. “The better I get, the faster I can repair.” </p><p>“Fair point,” she said reluctantly. </p><p>I was lucky that she wasn’t exactly a good negotiator. “I need a private forge,” I said. “Not now, but once the other workers join me. I can’t try new techniques in the middle of the others. It’ll distract them from their work,” I explained. </p><p>“I’ll try, but no promises. Even a small forge is not cheap,” she replied. “But, once the others arrive, you can still have two hours alone every day. The rest, I’ll try to get as soon as possible, but don’t expect much for at least ten days.”</p><p>“The next caravan?” I asked. </p><p>She nodded, and that was all we were able to talk before we arrived at the dining room. It was once again unnecessarily opulent, with a long table at the center, but Maria was alone in the room. “Finally,” she said, raising a glass. Her tone was slightly slurry. Not exactly drunk, but definitely cheerful.” </p><p>“Lady Maria,” Eleanor said coldly, though I had a feeling that I was the target. </p><p>“Come on, girl. You know I hate that stuff when we’re in private,” she said. Eleanor’s gaze sharpened. I flinched. I didn’t realize that I had already been promoted to the good friends category. Apparently, my attempt to keep her entertained worked better than I expected. </p><p>“Yes, Maria,” Eleanor said with a sigh, and sat down. I sat down as well. </p><p>“Enjoy, Devon,” Maria said with a generous gesture. </p><p>Befriending her was a dangerous thing. But, as I poured myself a glass of wine — a luxury that I had been craving for a long, long time — I found it difficult to take long-term risks. “Delicious, but very complex,” I muttered. “Almost like a cocktail rather than wine. I’m guessing it’s not an old wine?” </p><p>“No, it’s from our newest winery. Alchemists can brew some fascinating wines,” Maria explained. </p><p>“True,” I admitted. While I still preferred a properly aged wine, the new one was certainly incredible as well. I took another sip. </p><p>“So, how was the first proper day of work?” she asked. “Also, D3,” Maria said, taking another sip. </p><p>“It was more productive than I had first expected,” I said, giving a detailed breakdown of the day, except my forging experiments and my unexpected perk, and explained my success. Playing a chess game at the same time was rather difficult. Maria was half-drunk, which made it slightly easier, but not enough to prevent me from losing miserably. </p><p>Losing repeatedly was far more annoying when it wasn’t there as a tool to distract me from the lack of solid ground under my feet. So, when her moves slowed down as she listened to my report, I was glad. </p><p>“You already reduced repair time to twelve minutes. That’s good,” she said, her smile wide. “Can you reduce it further? That will allow us to get away with hiring even less Blacksmiths, right?” she said. </p><p>“We better hire the original amount we planned. We don’t know how far it’ll be reduced. And, having some extra capability won’t be too bad,” Eleanor replied. </p><p>“I’m confident that it could be reduced to eight minutes as long as I continue to work on it,” I said, careful not to overpromise it. Another trick, this time from publishing papers. It was always better to split any scientific discovery into multiple pieces and publish separately. That way, I could collect more rewards. </p><p>“That deserves a reward. I’ll bring you to another leveling tour the moment I have time,” Maria promised readily. It was an excellent offer. </p><p> “Only if I’m not preventing anything important. Otherwise, I can just join the dungeon parties to level up slowly,” I offered. It was easy to make sacrifices when I knew it wouldn’t be accepted. The message they had left in the workshop this morning already raised the possibility of an assassination. And, even without that, dungeons weren’t exactly the safest location for a blacksmith. </p><p>“Nonsense. Since Maria wants to help you, you should allow her,” Eleanor replied. </p><p>It further confirmed my assumption. They wouldn’t risk me. Even if they didn’t care about anything else I could potentially do for them, my life was critical until I could teach the other Blacksmiths how to repeat my methods. </p><p>I didn’t care too much about whether they would continue to treat me the same way once that part was done. I still had a week, which should be enough to get another perk from Forge and increase Repair significantly. </p><p>From there, I could use that offer to make a deal with Rosie, ideally targeting the same dungeon. </p><p>And, most importantly, another leveling trip would bring me to level twenty-five, the first threshold, which would actually increase the class bonuses. </p><p>“A fruitful discussion,” Maria said. “It’s time for another game. C3.”</p><p>I managed to hold back my sigh as I responded, trying to prepare myself for a few more spectacular defeats… </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Now, let’s see if the Inspect is worth it,” I said to myself even as I grabbed another damaged weapon. I dragged my finger over the blade as I closed my eyes, a subtle mental command enough to activate the feeling. </p><p>The internal structure of the sword once again appeared in my mind. I wanted to focus on the physical structure first, as the Inspect increased the amount of detail I could catch significantly. I was able to catch many microfractures and other stress points. The details of it were fascinating. </p><p>But, not as fascinating as the details I was able to pick from the Sharpness enchantment. With the Analyze, all I could see was a bunch of straight glowing lines that stretched from the hilt to the tip. That allowed me to reactivate the enchantment by repairing the metal of the sword, but its magical aspect had been incomprehensible. </p><p>Not anymore. Well, not the incomprehensible part. I could merely see some kind of movement in those previously opaque lines of mana, without any corresponding knowledge of what was going on. But, that didn’t ruin my mood. I was confident that I could leverage it even better. </p><p>Though, preferably later as far as the magic was concerned. As much as I wanted to start poking the enchantments, I knew that it was not a good idea. I didn’t have the tools or necessary safety measures. I didn’t even know what would happen if the enchantments got damaged, whether they just faded away or exploded. </p><p>”Baby steps,” I muttered even as I shifted my focus to the aspect I could understand. The physical components. Not just the first one, but every blade I had repaired. “Some changes are necessary,” I muttered as I realized that my earlier process had weakened the edge unnecessarily. Not exactly critical when fighting against beasts that destroy the sword after a few successful hits, but a major problem against anything else. </p><p>Still, an easy fix for the future. </p><p>I should return to my repair task, ideally to impress my new bosses with my success, but the temptation of another plan started to stir. A plan that had long been ignored because of its immense cost. A cost that was not relevant thanks to the overstocked workshop. </p><p>Improving my Forge skill. </p><p>The Forge was a neglected skill. A choice that was made not just by me, but the other Blacksmiths as well, for one simple reason. Unlike Repair, Forge was expensive to improve, requiring a lot of attempts. And, even when it succeeded, people preferred to buy premade enchanted weapons from the System Shop, cheap enough to make them useless. </p><p>Especially since it took hours, sometimes days to forge a weapon according to the directions of the Forge. It meant improving the skill required months of dedicated effort and money. Some Blacksmiths took the risk during the first year, usually sponsored by richer patrons, hoping to find some kind of synergy between the two skills. </p><p>They failed. </p><p>I could have tried the same, but those days, I was more focused on collecting the data for my research proposal, which had been a similar waste. Not to mention, I didn’t want to spend months improving a potentially useless skill. If repairing a weapon according to the System instructions was a chore, forging a weapon was a slow, tedious torture. </p><p>“Let’s see if wasting material could help,” I muttered even as I pulled a few ingots and threw them into the forge, softening them. Repair improved despite cutting corners. Maybe Forge would as well. The only problem, I wasn’t sure if I could turn the results back to ingots, because they were not pure but alloys. </p><p>Due to their process of forging, alloys could be tricky to refine back. </p><p>It was a fact that was true for even the ordinary steel that the world relied on before the Cataclysm. There were hundreds of types of steel based on carbon content, cooling process, and other minute additions, and they couldn’t simply be turned back. </p><p>It was even more relevant for the new alloys, which included many other types of materials, some exclusively from dungeon drops. It was why Forging caused the loss of material. It wasn’t simply some kind of disappearance. </p><p>Of course, just like Repair, Forge's skill came with some instinctual understanding of the recipes and methods for new alloys, including the mixing temperatures, process and timing, and cooling methods. </p><p>For the moment, with my Forging below level ten, all the information I had was ordinary, requiring no extraordinary dungeon drops and other complicated stuff. Back in town, I had calculated what would it take to actually bring me to my first perk. </p><p>Technically, I could have done it below twenty silver as far as the material cost went. Acceptable … but when I included the rent for the forge, and the loss of income from dedicated time, that amount had spiked to four gold even on the most optimistic scale. Using cheap materials meant that I needed to spend weeks on a single point. A waste for a skill that would potentially turn out to be useless. </p><p>But, it was back then. I had a forge dedicated to me that I could never afford otherwise, working with alloys I couldn’t purchase. </p><p>There was still a chance that it would be a total waste, but the temptation was too strong … particularly since I could mislead Eleanor. Not by fudging the numbers, of course. Not when I could claim that those experiments were how I managed to cut the repair time to four minutes. </p><p>An innocent white lie. I had told much worse lies during grant applications. </p><p>Science might be an honorable pursuit, but the same wasn’t true for grant applications. </p><p>I grabbed multiple ingots of the variant bronze alloy — one that was stronger than steel — and threw them into the forge, letting them heat up, while at the same time, I went through the designs that the skill provided, trying to pick the simplest one. </p><p>I settled on a small dagger. Normally, it would have been a terrible choice, as there was little chance they would be sold — daggers were not exactly the preferred weapons for giant monsters — but since they would go to waste, speed, and material consumption were more critical. </p><p>Once the material was ready, I focused on the skill, trying to find the most ideal method. Unfortunately, even as my hammer landed on the first time, there was no reaction. My skill level was too low to work on the material. </p><p>“Frustrating,” I muttered. I was hoping that there would be some kind of suggestion. There wasn’t. I did my best to follow my past experiences to forge a dagger. Using long tongs, I rotated it meticulously as I beat it repeatedly, flattening it. Then, I folded the metal into two, heated, and repeated. </p><p>Only for the metal to crack. A failure. A spectacular one. </p><p>“I wish it triggered the repair,” I said. Unfortunately, for that, a weapon first needed to be completed based on System specifications. Another clumsy detail of the System. </p><p>I tried four more methods, wasting four more ingots. Ironically, since my mistakes were so catastrophic, they didn’t exactly turn them useless. I could still use them to Repair — </p><p>“Oh, I’m a moron,,” I cursed myself, realizing that I had missed something very obvious. Yes, the Forge skill didn’t tell me how to work this particular allow. But, Repair did. </p><p>With a big smile, I grabbed another sword, but this time, I followed the System's suggestions religiously. An hour later, I was not even halfway repairing the sword — not having Warm Blow slowing it considerably — but that didn’t ruin my smile. </p><p>I had already learned a lot about how to use the alloy without fracturing the metal, and the detailed information provided by Inspect already showed its worth, though only because I had spent some time trying to understand every metallurgy resource I could find. </p><p>I made another attempt to forge a dagger. This time, I managed to fold the metal six times before I ruined it. This time, it was useless even for repair work, but I didn’t care. I heated up another ingot and made another dagger. This time, I only folded the metal four times before I started shaping it. </p><p>In every objective standard, it was a terrible dagger. It was structurally weak, brittle, lacking the necessary tempering to properly hold an edge, and had multiple stress points that begged to be snapped. Stabbing someone was more merciful than giving them the dagger as a weapon. </p><p>Yet, none of those details could ruin my mood. A notification popped. </p><p>[Forge (Common) - 8 -&gt; 11]</p><p>[Perk Options — Masterwork / Intuitive Forging] </p><p>I froze as I read the perk offers. Masterwork was one of the options I expected, but to my knowledge, the other perk was supposed to be Frugal Forge, which worked in a similar manner to Efficient Repair. Masterwork, on the other hand, provided better designs, but they cost more to complete. </p><p>“Why can’t the System give explanations for perks,” I muttered, frustrated even as I found myself in a dilemma. Should I pick Masterwork, or take the risk. But, even as I bit my lips in worry, I knew what I would do. </p><p>I had very little use for Masterwork. Even ignoring the name, just the fact that I was getting a previously unknown Perk was a good opportunity. It was very likely that I was not the first one to discover such an opportunity, but people didn’t go around sharing secrets.</p><p>I made my choice. </p><p>[Forge (Common) - 11 [Intuitive Forging]]</p><p>Curious of its impact, I started working on another ingot, forging another dagger. Once again, there was no detailed connection from the System, but as I worked, I noticed a change. Occasionally, I was getting a slight suggestion, allowing me to catch some big mistakes. </p><p>This time, I managed to fold the dagger properly ten times, and the rest of the process was smoother as well. When the dagger was completed, I had my reward. </p><p>[Forge (Common) - 11 -&gt; 12]</p><p>“Excellent,” I muttered as I melted the daggers to destroy the evidence, and returned to my repair work. Improving my Forge skill had been nice, and discovering a new trick to use Repair to improve Forge was even better. </p><p>However, I couldn’t forget the role played by the extremely valuable tools in the forge, the kind that I wouldn’t come close to purchasing even with my newfound wealth. </p><p>I needed to keep my employer happy. Luckily, all I needed was to repair enough weapons to keep them satisfied. Luckily, since I had yet to reveal my latest achievement of dropping it to four minutes, it was easy to keep them happy. Just another improvement to a rate of twelve minutes was enough. </p><p>I received another notification as I worked, which put an even bigger smile on my face. </p><p>[Repair (Common) - 25 -&gt; 26]</p><p>Sometimes, hard work was its own reward. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Once I broke through the first layer of the surround, I ran deeper into the valley, with the sorcerer and the cavalry behind me, and the shifter auxiliaries still gathering to cut my path … one that I deliberately started to reveal once more as I pushed the dragon heart to generate more mana, keeping it in a level that would allow the others to detect me, but not enough to prevent me from revert the transformation of my arm. </p><p>I needed them to believe my ability to conceal myself was temporary. I needed them to follow me, or I couldn’t lead them to an ambush, which was the only way I could hope to win against a sorcerer. </p><p>When the shifters had entered my range, running toward me, guided by their nose and the guidance of the horn signals, I focused on my arm turning it to a normal state. Before they burst into the opening, I dropped the bundle of spears down, and grabbed three of them with my left hand, with my gladius on the left. </p><p>“Surrender, and we’ll show mercy,” the one at the front had declared even as the others had spread around me, surrounding to attack me. There were eight of them. It felt like fighting against a wolf pack, with most of the force spread around, ready to go. </p><p>I wasn’t the only one struggling with the instincts. Even if they had weapons, their approach was more like a wolf than a human. On the face of it, it was not a bad strategy. There was a reason that wolves were one of the most dangerous hunters in the world despite not matching other beasts in size and sheer destructiveness. </p><p>Circling the prey, continuously distracting it with feints and false attacks until one of them could attack from behind to wound the attacker, hurting the mobility. It was a good tactic, especially with their current objective was to delay me until the rest had caught up with me. </p><p>Unfortunately for them, while that tactic was good, allowing them to deal with the prey that was stronger and even faster, it was based on one condition. The prey needed to be less agile. </p><p>Which was not the case for them. Yet, I deliberately let them attack multiple times, leaving bleeding wounds as the attackers got closer and closer. After my earlier success, I needed a defeat, one that would convince the sorcerer behind me that I was not a threat, but a desperate wounded animal, one that dealt with the earlier squad only because of a cowardly ambush. </p><p>I struggled under their combined attacks before one of them had gotten too arrogant. Before he could complete the attack, I swung my sword, decapitating him. While the others howled in shock, three pilums flew, their accuracy seemingly poor as two sank into the stomach of the attackers, and one to the leg. </p><p>I rushed, and killed another before he could react to sudden change, but not before he could deliver a painful stomach wound, and then I grabbed the bundle of pilums and started running away, making a show of stumbling to the distance as I bled badly. </p><p>In truth, it was harder to keep the wounds from closing. </p><p>Dealing with the Roman squad without a wound while letting the much weaker shifter wound me was another deliberate sacrifice. The shifters were much weaker than the scout team, but their speed and agility were their advantage. </p><p>My struggle against them should convince the sorcerer that the speed I had shown while I escaped his spell was not an ability I could repeat. Convincing him to that might be the only way to deal a deadly blow. </p><p>I had pushed forward steadily, avoiding the next ambush completely, picking a speed that ‘just’ avoided their next two pincher attempts, drifting away from two air mages who were using their magic to move faster. </p><p>The only reason I was able to get away from them was my detection capabilities. A combination of mana sensing, sharper eyes, and better hearing was impossible to beat. And, on the battlefield, information was the most dangerous power. </p><p>As I continued to move deeper, I could feel my enemies getting more and more desperate. The sound of their horns turned louder and louder, and the cavalry pushed themselves to move faster, enough to risk their horses even if they were second order. </p><p>They were desperate to cut my path. </p><p>But, neither had shown desperation as much as the sorcerer, who started to rain fire on my path from a great distance, doing his best to cut my path at the risk of exhausting himself. Whatever that was in the depths of the valley, they were desperate not to confront it. </p><p>Soon, my path had been covered with flames, which was significantly more unfortunate. That meant I couldn’t go to the valley, not without bursting through the flames … which I couldn’t do without signaling that I had been faking my true limits all along. </p><p>The bigger problem was that the sudden forest fire had taken away my advantages. As the smoke rose, it blocked my vision, the crackling of the fire making listening far more difficult. I could hear the movement, but not enough that I could distinguish them. </p><p>However,, I had been ready. What truly caught me unprepared was my mana senses. The more fire spells that the sorcerer used, the weirder his mana presence started to feel. At first, he was a man, wrapped in an aura of flames, but the more spells he had used, the weaker the presence of the man had turned, and the stronger the presence of flames had become. </p><p>Soon, his presence was indistinguishable from a forest fire, while he could probably feel my presence from the flames once he got close enough. </p><p>Like it wasn’t enough, the flames had been radiating enough mana to overshadow the presence of the ordinary mages, making it harder to pick them, particularly the weaker ones. </p><p>I wondered whether he had long realized my true limits, or if it was just pure misfortune. Maybe it was just a side effect he had been struggling with. With that, I had been trapped, likely due to an accident, all because I had underestimated their fear of the danger at the center of the valley. </p><p>Information was a deadly weapon, and this time, I was the one that was stabbed. </p><p>“It’s time for another stupid risk,” I muttered even as I closed my eyes, focusing inward as I ignored everything. The fire, the sorcerer, the slumbering danger at the center of the valley… </p><p>I focused on the beast vitae in my arm, separated the smallest piece I could control, and dragged it to my head. More accurately, to my right eye. The vitae settled there obediently, and I started feeding it mana desperately, forcing the transformation to spread. </p><p>And, with it, came pain. “I can’t believe I have to thank you again, you crazy old man,” I muttered even as I desperately brought one of the pilums to my teeth before biting. The pain from forced transformation was incredible, but thanks to my training, I could maintain my transformation. </p><p>The dragon heart responded to pain, pumping more and more mana, which I channeled into my transformation. I could feel my eyeball shuffle and shift, my gaze getting sharper and sharper. I kept my left eye closed, while my right eye turned sharper and sharper. </p><p>As the pain started to fade, neither the fire nor the smoke was enough to block my sight. At a distance, I could see three air mages flying desperately, ready to dive and take me. However, on their face, I could see more greed than fear. </p><p>However, they were not the only ones I could see. At a distance, the cavalry had been spread in a half circle, ready to cut my path and delay me, mages mixing with them. The shifters had been spread among them, holding the first line their positioning enough to confirm that my earlier tricks had been successful. </p><p>The thing that caught my attention was the figure at the back with the Spear of Scipio on his back. He looked not just exhausted, but tense, similar to how I looked while I struggled against the transformation. It was clear that burning half of the forest quickly took a lot of him. </p><p>They were trying to get the dragon heart, thinking that I was already spent. </p><p>Not that I couldn’t understand. While the flames blocked the presence of many things, the mysterious existence in the valley was not one of them. And, I could feel its stirrings. A subtle change, but it was waking up. </p><p>I was alone, lacking the armaments as I faced a sorcerer supported by a small army, an even greater danger stirring behind me. </p><p>Yet, now that I had no choice, I didn’t feel fear but excitement. I wondered if it was the dragon heart forcing a new set of instincts, or if it was my training showing itself once more. </p><p>Not that it mattered. The enemy had spread thin, their visibility compromised, and their most mobile forces committed early to a battle due to a horrible strategic decision due to misinformation. And, most importantly, the sorcerer, their strongest member, had already pushed himself to the limit. </p><p>“This is for you, old man,” I grunted as I tightened my hold on the pilum. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Damnation,” I cursed even as I threw myself from the tree, knowing that there was no chance for me to suppress the flare of mana as the Dragon Heart responded to my anger, the mana density of the valley insufficient to cover such an intense outburst. </p><p>I threw myself off the tree, just in time for a column of fire to collapse against the tree, far stronger than any mage should have been capable of. </p><p>A sorcerer. </p><p>Not that it was a surprise. The moment I saw the Spear of Scipio on his back, I knew that he was the one that I had felt back at the Scipio Estate. That raised some other questions, like how he managed to arrive here so quickly, and how he was able to carry the Spear despite lacking a bestowment ritual. </p><p>Those questions were interesting, but I was too busy running deeper into the valley, using my speed to the limit. The dragon heart was filling my heart with more mana with each thump, making it impossible for me to hide even if I could suppress my anger. </p><p> I couldn’t suppress it. Not when I was looking at the real killer of my grandfather. I didn’t care if he just gave the order. He was the one responsible for not only his death, but also for his body to be treated as a rag doll.</p><p>And, right now, he was carrying the same weapon the old man had been so proud of as a trophy. I didn’t care about the spear itself, but the disrespect of him carrying it burned something fierce. </p><p>I would have gone forward to rip them into pieces if I didn’t know how much my grandfather would have hated me for dying so pathetically. Instead, I tightened my grip as I moved deeper into the valley, trying to find a way I could fight against a sorcerer. </p><p>Meeting with Lillian and Astrid, I ignored them immediately. They weren’t weak, but Lillian still lacked combat experience, and Astrid’s abilities required a lot of time to practice. Neither of them would be any help against a sorcerer. More importantly, I couldn’t protect them against a sorcerer. </p><p>Cutting a wild path toward the nearest exit was tempting. Living to fight another day was always a valid choice. Hopefully, they wouldn’t be able to match my speed, and eventually, I would be able to get away … but in doing so, I would have to sacrifice Lillian and Astrid. </p><p>In the valley, they would eventually be discovered. I doubted that they would have a pleasant fate after. I found that deeply unacceptable. I had always envisioned living as a loner, a drifter without any connection, but that somehow changed between that disaster on the island and right now. I couldn’t. </p><p>So fucking frustrating. </p><p>“Revenge, it is,” I muttered even as I cut a straight path toward the center of the valley. But, I wasn’t moving as fast as possible. My speed was significant, but nothing that couldn’t be matched by an apprentice mage with a reinforced body. </p><p>I was angry, but not angry enough to lose my senses. I didn’t know just how good the detection abilities of a sorcerer were, and I needed to keep my abilities as secret as possible. </p><p>The situation was clear. I couldn’t get away safely with Lillian and Astrid in tow, meaning I had to hurt them enough to make an unappealing idea. And, what better way to do than taking my revenge. All I needed was a successful ambush, and to do that, I needed them to underestimate me. </p><p>Behind me, I could hear the horns blaring at full volume. I wasn’t able to decipher the message. Every legion had its own code, which they rotated often to prevent the enemy from reading the orders easily. However, at least a part of it was obvious. </p><p>Behind me, I could feel the approach of the cavalry brave enough to ride in a thick forest. In front of me, the scouts were gathering to envelop me. At full speed, I could slip through the net without getting caught. </p><p>I slowed down instead, moving directly toward the nearest group. </p><p>A message about the dangers of following me was appropriate. However, as I ran forward, I could feel my arm transform back into its scaly form outside my control, the mana density forcing it to appear. I wasn’t complaining. It was an excellent weapon. One that I couldn’t use casually. </p><p>I couldn’t afford them to know about my transformation. Meaning, I had another reason to kill the sorcerer, who might be able to feel the transformation from a distance — not that I needed any more. Revenge for my grandfather was enough. </p><p>Since pulling back the transformation was not possible, I fed my mana to my arm desperately, feeling the scales grow and strengthen almost limitlessly as the vitae absorbed the mana like linen cloth. Normally, reinforcing vitae was a delicate process requiring meditation, but the beast vitae easily absorbed it. </p><p>While I was reluctant to further strengthen my arm before I could understand what was going on, it was safer than trying to radiate mana constantly. Without my bubbling mana, I might avoid their detection. </p><p>When my mana density dropped to a point that could keep me hidden, I sped up. I was targeting the same scout team that I had detected earlier. Twenty-four soldiers, with a mage. A dangerous enemy to confront directly, but I knew what they had been relying on. So, I moved faster to cut their path and climbed to a tree. Merely twenty seconds later, they were passing under me. </p><p>The mage didn’t even register my presence as I landed on his back and killed him with one blow. That earned shouts from the legionnaires, but before they could register, I had already drawn the sword of the mage with my left hand. </p><p>I wasn’t as comfortable using a sword right-handed, but with my right hand turned into a claw, I didn’t have any option. I used my right arm as a shield to deflect the attacks, while I cut them mercilessly. The five apprentices, I dealt with before they could even tap into their elements. However, even when ambushed and facing a superior enemy, the legionnaires were professional enough to react. </p><p>I found myself surrounded by eighteen men, each carrying a gladius and a tower shield. They tried to collapse on me, trying to cut my escape path, but they weren’t fast enough to trap me. Five more had fallen, which was enough to destroy their morale. </p><p>They tried to run away. They failed. </p><p>“What an ignoble fate,” I muttered even as I shifted the location of the bodies. Faced directly, an earth mage could have defended the group until the reinforcements arrived. Unfortunately, the battlefield was not a place for mistakes. </p><p>I changed the pattern of the bodies, and, I added multiple wounds, making it look like they were ambushed by multiple people. It wouldn’t be enough to convince if someone were to study the battle carefully, but I wasn’t the only one who was working under the time constraints. </p><p>Before I left, I also collected their spears, and took two swords, carrying them as a bundle. I wasn’t in a position to turn my back on even the slightest benefit. </p><p>I didn’t spend more than a minute setting the battlefield before I started to run again. I didn’t have any other choice with the sorcerer getting closer and closer. The moment he cast a spell, his presence turned impossible to miss. </p><p>The mana gathered around him, making his presence a bonfire to anyone with a magical sense. </p><p>It was the difference between a sorcerer and a lower-order mage. An apprentice mage or a mage had no choice but to mediate to absorb the mana from the environment, and process it through their elemental vitae before using. </p><p>Sorcerers didn’t need to mediate. The mana reacted to their very presence, and they could transform the mana into elemental energy directly around them. Unfortunately, I didn’t know their range or effectiveness. The only thing I knew was the closer to their bodies, the more efficient the transformation. </p><p>That alone was an incredible benefit during a magical duel. Mages were limited by the amount of mana they had absorbed beforehand, which was not limitless. Then, the flexibility it afforded was also incredible. By casting spells outside their bodies, they could defend easier, and </p><p>Even if they had the same raw power, a sorcerer could easily deal with multiple mages … which was another problem. They had more raw power as well. </p><p>There was a reason sorcerers were the ultimate deterrent. </p><p>And, I needed to kill someone showing those abilities, with nothing more than a monstrous arm and a bunch of spears. Pilums, to be more exact, spears made of soft iron as they were designed to ruin enemy shields rather than kill. </p><p>I just hoped that whatever in the valley would dislike him more than me. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Scouting during the daytime was always a challenging affair even with all my new abilities. When we had bypassed the checkpoints, we were moving through the passages that were supposed to be impassable. Quite different from dealing with alert mages who were actively searching for me. </p><p>I kept a tight hold on my mana as I moved around, carefully erasing our tracks and laying false tracks. It was a slow, time-consuming affair, especially since I had to worry not just about the physical tracks, but also smells and mana residue. </p><p>I had to mix several herb mixtures that would conceal the smell without being too overpowering, which was a trick process. It slowed me down even more, but making sure the enemies wouldn’t have a track to follow was more important than understanding exactly who we were dealing with. </p><p>No matter how much it rankled me due to my teachings. </p><p>While my childhood training had been extensively on magic and combat, it was never to the point of neglecting the military training. My grandfather taught me a lot about military tactics, claiming that even a bastard of a Scipio family had to understand the basics. </p><p>Of course, what he considered basics was very different than what other people might have believed. Just like his magical training, his military training was nothing short of torture. But, as I started to catch the signs of the enemy, I was glad for it. </p><p>At this point, the only enemy I was able to feel was half a dozen shifters, each with wolf legs that made them move faster. Two of them had distorted faces as well, constantly sniffing. But, the pattern they spread, and the way they moved strongly implied that they didn’t fear any threat from behind them. </p><p>“So, the auxiliary scouts rather than some kind of raiding party,” I muttered to myself even as I approached. It was not good news. Having two enemies was better than having one. But, it wasn’t something I could change. </p><p>Instead, I circled around them, careful not to let them smell my presence, watching them operate. It was inconvenient that they were speaking in German, which prevented me from eavesdropping them. Still, I stayed, watching as they operated. </p><p>I was trying to understand just how good they were, so that I could adjust the quality of the false tracks I was laying. Those tracks needed to be obvious enough for them to catch it easily, yet subtle enough for them not to suspect foul play. </p><p>As I observed, I started taking note of their habits and tendencies, which cost me another precious hour. But, warfare was not the domain of the impatient. Everything depended on making them believe that we were moving deeper into the valley, and not outside. </p><p>Only after shifters actually believed those false tracks and started to move deeper, I retreated. I took a wide circle, checking Astrid and Lillian from a distance. They were still bickering, but not enough to actually make them careless. </p><p>I didn’t show myself to them. Instead, I moved in the opposite direction. Admittedly, even with my abilities, I wasn’t feeling entirely confident approaching an army. Particularly when that army was a Roman Legion. </p><p>Not a full legion, hopefully, but even a cohort was not something I wanted to tangle. One aspect of my very detailed military training. I knew exactly what I was facing, and it scared me. </p><p>There was a reason that the Roman Republic expanded when others had fallen despite their greater advantages. A legion was a dangerous combination of military and magical competence. Even the common soldiers would be signed for a fifteen-year term, summers spent fighting while winters spent training. Forty-eight hundred men, all living together, trained for one purpose. </p><p>And, while Rome had many faults, a commitment to meritocracy was not one of those mistakes. Any legionnaire that showed an aptitude for various types of magic had been allowed to train, and provided with resources from the legion coffers. </p><p>While they couldn’t match the potential of someone who had been trained since childhood, making a breakthrough to third order relatively rare, it still meant that even the weakest legion had more than a hundred mages, often more. </p><p>Add in the fact that they were led by a legate that was sent from Rome, which was either from a patrician family, or from a plebeian one that had enough political power to make them practically nobles, and always experienced sorcerers… </p><p>There was a reason I was tense. </p><p>I didn’t know just how much force they had committed to the valley, but the number of scouting parties I stumbled upon as I moved closer, I believed that they had committed at least a full-sized cohort. Four hundred and eighty soldiers, which didn’t count the auxiliary scouts and other servants.</p><p>Hopefully, it was not one of the cohorts that was led by a sorcerer, but merely a peak mage. </p><p>Knowing what I might face intimidated me somewhat, but not enough that I stopped moving. I traversed the forest, glad that I had spent a lot of time exploring the valley. That gave me a good path to avoid the risk of discovery or a sudden encounter with the scout parties. </p><p>Another half an hour of careful travel, I met with a secondary scouting party, this time legionnaires, their armor quite distinct. ”That’s not good news,” I muttered as I saw them at a distance. Twenty-four people, which meant three full teams. </p><p>It was not good news, for two reasons. First, assigning twenty-four soldiers to one scouting party was excessive unless they were expecting immediate combat. Moreover, from their search pattern, it was obvious that they were not the only scout team in the second wave. Their pattern suggested at least ten more.</p><p>Which was half a cohort. So, either they were led by someone totally incompetent, deciding to send their full force to search the valley without surrounding the place, or I was dealing with far more than one cohort. </p><p>I grimaced. As much as I wanted the first one to be true — as incompetent centurions were not exactly unheard of — I had a feeling that the second was far more likelier. </p><p>A deep breath later, I moved to the side, making sure to put some distance with the scout group. From such a great distance, I couldn’t be sure whether they had a dedicated scout mage. Depending on their method, I might get caught. </p><p>I stayed hidden, watching the way they moved and reacted to the threats. It was not too difficult as long as I was willing to commit some time. I stayed behind a rock, watching them from a great distance. I didn’t even need to arrange a distraction. The valley was teeming with enough second-order beasts for it to happen soon. </p><p>A large snake approached their group a little too close before they noticed, but a large bear, they noticed easily. Just to confirm, I moved closer to their group with soft, silent steps, but it went unnoticed. </p><p>An earth mage, detecting the approach through vibrations. A good method for a thick forest in a deep valley, as it didn’t rely on visibility. Unfortunately for him, I was agile enough to fake the gait of a beast. Soon, I circled around them safely, bypassing the second scout party. </p><p>“Now, I just need to find a nice vantage point,” I said as I moved to a location I remembered. It was a thick portion of forest near a spring, with trees around much taller. More importantly, it was sufficiently out of the way not to have any scout nearby, and the main army would be far away from it due to a lack of flat space nearby. </p><p>A perfect target for me to carefully observe them without being discovered in turn. However, that didn’t mean I could afford to be hasty. I climbed the tree, careful not to ruffle even a branch until I was high enough to see the entrance of the valley.</p><p>The moment I saw that, a curse escaped my mouth. It wasn’t the number of soldiers I could see at the entrance. I could count three hundred, which was already in my calculations. It was their main camp, and I could see the military standards of two cohorts, each belonging to the 11th Legion, but there was no legion standard. </p><p>Meaning, the deployment was ‘merely’ for a thousand soldiers. Nowhere near the worst case. </p><p>No, I cursed for a different reason. The moment I looked at their main camp, anger hit me hard. I could have suppressed it easily, but before I could do so, the dragon heart flared, filling my body with a dangerous amount of mana, too thick for me to contain it properly. </p><p>As for who was responsible for it. </p><p>A group of soldiers, displaying a standard with a sigil of a black snake. And, at the center, an unknown man who earned my fury for a simple reason. On his back, there was a familiar weapon. </p><p>The Spear of Scipio. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Returning to Markas was always a pleasant feeling. Too bad I didn’t have time to go back to my base and linger happily while I worked.</p><p>Instead, I stopped by the spirit vein to recharge the reserves of my flying boat before I moved to my real destination. The cell that was holding the Foundation Establishment prisoner.</p><p>I watched him for a while before showing myself, to see how he was coping with imprisonment. He had a large smile on his face as he continuously used his Qi to slowly wear down the formation, trying to reach the formation disk. With his current speed of progress, it would have taken months for him to succeed, but he continued to work steadily.</p><p>He was determined, which didn’t surprise me. While the disciples from the sects treated the Foundation Establishment as a guaranteed step, for the itinerant cultivators, it represented the peak. I had seen thousands of itinerant cultivators in the market, and he was one of the few Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p><p>One didn’t climb those heights without impressive determination.</p><p>I was so glad that I had created a fake weakness to keep him busy. Maybe reinforcing that impression would be helpful, I decided even as I fiddled with the formation slightly, creating a function where the density of the Qi increased slightly as he progressed ‘destroying’ the formation.</p><p>Once that addition was complete, I pulled back first. When I walked forward again, I was walking loudly enough to give him a chance to stop fiddling with the formation. When I arrived again, he was sitting at the center of his cave, meditating.</p><p>“How’s the prison life,” I asked smugly.</p><p>He responded with a pressure wave, trying to put me on my knees. I made a show of trying to resist, until my knees buckled. He smirked even as it cost him some of his precious Qi reserves. Only when he was about to fail, I moved back, seemingly in defeat.</p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 140; Insult Bonus - 240 (Capped)]</p><p>[380x Return - 14,291 Qi Strand]</p><p>I was getting better and better at manipulating the pointless pride of the cultivators to earn some valuable insults.</p><p>“Better than walking around like a headless chicken, you spoiled waste of space,” he answered.</p><p>“You sound just like my pathetic cousin. And, I’ll show him, just like I’ll show you,” I replied. “But first, I have some questions for you,” I said.</p><p>“Never,” he answered.</p><p>I shrugged. “If you prefer to die, I’m happy to oblige,” I said as I walked toward the formation disk.</p><p>“No, wait,” he said, quick to change his attitude. “As long as you promise to let me go when your task is finished, I’ll answer any questions except my own secrets.”</p><p>“Fair. I swear on my honor,” I replied, not bothering to make it look particularly believable. I didn’t need to. Not when he was just stalling for time. Amusingly, depending on how helpful he was being, I might actually let him go.</p><p>After all, he knew absolutely nothing about me.</p><p>“Ask your questions,” he said.</p><p>“Let’s start with something simple. I want you to give me a list of every item you have discovered while exploring the Misty Mountains, their locations, and how much you have sold them for,” I said, even passing him a map I had drawn based on what I had seen at the base.</p><p>“Really, that’s what you want?” he asked, looking surprised.</p><p>“Yes. I need to understand what’s at the outskirts if I’m to discover the secrets of the Misty Mountains,” I declared proudly like I was arrogant enough to discover the secrets of it when generations of other cultivators failed.</p><p>To be fair, I was trying to do exactly that, but only because I had a near-omnipotent cheat.</p><p>“Fine,” he said. “But that’s the only thing I will reveal to you this month. If you want more, you need to pay,” he challenged, quick to turn into a bargain.</p><p>“That, and any question I might ask to clarify what you have written on the list,” I replied. “The other questions, I’ll pay you in talismans.”</p><p>We bargained a bit on the number and the quality of the talismans, but he was quick to accept a lowball offer. Ultimately, he was just trying to keep himself alive until he could escape, making it an easy deal.</p><p>It took almost an hour for him to write a full list, which included a huge list of items, the environment they were discovered, the sales price, and where he had sold them. I wasn’t planning to make use of the trade aspects. I was more interested in what lay in the deeper parts. Hopefully, asking for more questions would conceal my true aim somewhat.</p><p>Only somewhat.</p><p>I was checking both his vital signs and his Qi movement through a detection formation to see if he was writing falsehood. Amusingly, the alchemy technique I had received included some information on how to detect falsehoods through the Qi movement.</p><p>The technique wasn’t foolproof. It was far from it, even. It was more like a polygraph, which was famous for generating false positive results. The trick of reading Qi included in the alchemy technique wasn’t too much better.</p><p>Still, it didn’t have to be. I had managed to catch a vicious surge in a few times while he was writing the information. I had a feeling that he was neglecting some key information that would turn those locations into death traps.</p><p>It was a simple but effective plan. If I die, he could slowly free himself without any risk of my betrayal. Too bad for him that not only I was far more capable than he could even imagine, but also I didn’t have any need to actually raid most of the places directly.</p><p>“Here, every discovery and the related transactions I had made during the last decade,” he declared generously. He was a good liar.</p><p>“Fine,” I muttered as I started to check the sales. At first, I was focusing on the mentions of good spiritual plants, which combined well with my ability to raise more. While Markas or the surrounding space didn’t need any additional Qi from plants, transferring it was a significant challenge.</p><p>I would have to create multiple bases deeper into the mist to have any hope of actually reaching the old capital of the Everdawn Empire according to the map, let alone exploring it steadily.</p><p>However, my first idea was to talk to the buyers of the spirit plants and see if I could make a bulk purchase before maybe creating an opportunity to recycle them through the System in some manner. Or better, find someone that could buy them for me. I just needed to create a believable situation.</p><p>Maybe the Treasure Pavilion would be willing to resell, I thought as I checked how many of those plants had been purchased by the Treasure Pavilion. The answer turned out to be … none. Just like they had purchased no minerals, cultivation techniques, or other items.</p><p>The list showed that the only thing they had purchased was the remains from the ruins. Apparently, they weren’t particularly choosy. They purchased anything that came from the ruins of the Misty Mountains.</p><p>And, their payments had been incredible. Apparently, not only he had purchased multiple techniques from them, but even his Foundation Establishment pill came from them. It was important, because that pill had a near-legendary existence among the itinerant cultivators. Apparently, it was a must for them to step out of the Qi Gathering stage.</p><p>A great variety of products, all for the ruins of the Everdawn Empire. They must have been really rich to commit all those rewards for something with no immediate reward. It wasn’t just the fact that they were selling the products. The fact that no one dared to attack their Pavilion despite it holding that many treasures was a better indicator of their real power.</p><p>All that might, and they were still interested in the secrets of the Everdawn Empire … yet they didn’t interfere directly. That alone confirmed two things. Not only the secrets were more valuable than I had realized, but also they were more valuable. It was not a happy realization.</p><p>I decided to follow up, playing the role of the arrogant rich kid even more.</p><p>“I have a question about the Treasure Pavilion. Do they buy nothing else than the antique remains?” I asked.</p><p>“You didn’t know that?” he asked, surprised. “Just where did you come from to not have the Treasure Pavilion to even not know the rules.”</p><p>I shrugged. “Back home, it’s the servant's job to buy and sell stuff. I could hardly be bothered. I studied the noble art of talismans,” I explained.</p><p>He looked incredulous. “Really?” he asked, and I nodded. “Yes. The treasure pavilion only accepts the items from the ruins. Too bad I don’t have the skills to forge fakes, or I’ll be really rich,” he said, the latter part clearly a trap.</p><p>“Oh, maybe I should see if I could fake a calligraphy or two. I’m a true expert,” I replied arrogantly, letting him believe that he had convinced me.</p><p>After that, I followed with a lot of other questions about the other traders to get a better understanding of the situation, which also gave me the location of a few itinerant alchemists who purchased these plants in bulk.</p><p>However, I noticed that none of the alchemists he revealed was at the Foundation Establishment realm. The ones he gave up were already useless to him.</p><p>“Alright, that’s enough for today. We’ll talk later. And, I hope none of those information turns out to be a lie, or I’ll start cutting fingers,” I warned him.</p><p>“I would like to see you try,” he answered, hitting me with another wave of pressure.</p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 140; Insult Bonus - 240 (Capped)]</p><p>[380x Return - 6,870 Qi Strand]</p><p>He was truly a model prisoner.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Before leaving the inner sanctum, I had stopped by the center of the defensive formation, and made some small adjustments, making sure that I would be able to travel near the formation with my flying boat. The detection feature of their formation was complicated, which meant adding some exceptions had been easy. </p><p>I stopped by the barracks and kidnapped two people. The bully that targeted me, and one of the new recruits that had managed to reach Muscle Refinement in Everdawn Fist. Carrying them with me wasn’t easy as I left the camp, but it was worth it. </p><p>When I left the formation, I merely traveled five miles before activating the boat and left. A Black Grade flying boat had many features, including camouflage. With the formation sabotaged, it could keep me hidden from the martial artists keeping guard easily. </p><p>My destination was the Misty Mountains. Since the camp was already close to the edge, it didn’t take long for my boat to disappear in the mist. “Once more onto the breach,” I muttered as the visibility dropped significantly. </p><p>I wasn’t happy with the necessity. The Misty Mountains were truly a dangerous place, where even Foundation Establishment cultivators could disappear without a mark. There were also stories of Golden Core elders dying inside, but whether they were true, I didn’t know. Idle gossip was hardly the most reliable source. </p><p>Still, it was dangerous for me, especially if I was surprised. I couldn’t use the boat, as sooner or later, the stored Qi would be depleted, and I didn’t have enough spirit stones to keep it going. I was even less reluctant to use my Qi from the inventory. </p><p>Not to mention, there might be entities that could easily shatter the defenses of the boat. And, even with all its camouflage formations, a flying boat was hardly subtle. So, once I moved a few miles, I packed the boat, and instead built a quick defensive formation. </p><p>I stayed there, with my captives still unconscious. With a flick of my hand, their bodies had been filled with needles. </p><p>“It’s time for an experiment,” I muttered even as I closed my eyes. My martial essence lay immobile, affected by whatever had been going on, which made it impossible to use my apothecary abilities directly, but I was able to replace it with Qi. A wasteful attempt, but the importance of the experiment required it. </p><p>The Tiger Fist disciple had already been struggling. Not only his essence was inert, but also the mist was attacking his flesh like a disease. It was a slow process, but there was no doubt that he wouldn’t survive even for a week. </p><p>The Everdawn Disciple, on the other hand, experiences the reverse. His essence had been active, and it was also directly being nourished by the mist. There was even a subtle, but lingering connection with Dawn essence. The impact was subtle enough that even I was able to barely catch it. </p><p>A fascinating situation, one that triggered some interesting theories about the origin of the mist. Previously, I had just assumed that it was some kind of cultivation effect, another sign of Qi cultivators' absolute superiority over martial artists. </p><p>However, watching the way the mist interacted with the Dawn essence, an alternate interpretation was certainly possible. But, further tests were needed. I created another formation, one that would put the target into some kind of half trance, and add a few simple illusions. </p><p>I even added a few calligraphies and drawings to reinforce the idea of Everdawn. Increasing his purity of essence was a good idea. </p><p>“Wake up,” I called as I pressed an acupuncture point. </p><p>“What’s going on. Where am I — ” the recruit slurred, jolting into action the moment he saw me. He stood up, only to kneel in front of me. “Immortal.” </p><p>“Calm down, child,” I called, deliberately using a haughty tone. I didn’t blame him for the conclusion, as the environment had been intense enough. “I noticed you when I was strolling in the land of dreams. We have a fate together, so I decided to teach you.” </p><p>“Yes, master,” he called immediately, more than happy to accept my instructions. “A-are you going to teach me cultivation?” </p><p>“No, your fate lies in the true fate of Everdawn Empire,” I said. “I’m going to teach you a new style, Everdawn Saber. Prepare,” I said as I pulled a mortal saber from the ring and passed it to him. </p><p>“Yes, master,” he called, enthusiastic. </p><p>“Watch carefully. The first form,” I said as I started teaching him. Naturally, I had held a tight grip on my essence, not letting it transform into what I termed as Dawn essence. It was too risky with the mysterious mist affecting the essence. </p><p>I taught him only the first move, but with my suggestions, he was easily able to reach Minor Familiarity in less than an hour. </p><p>“That’s enough for today. Remember, never reveal what you have learned,” I said, and before he could answer, I put him back to sleep. </p><p>Then, I started examining his essence once more. Using Everdawn Saber, his essence had been strengthened somewhat, but it required a careful examination to notice. Once again, I could feel the same sense of emptiness due to a lack of feedback from the spiritual pillar. </p><p>“Interesting,” I muttered even as I put my captives back and brought them out. I wanted to use my own apothecary skills to examine the changes properly, which was not possible as long as I was in the confines of the mist. </p><p>I kept a careful watch on both of them even as we moved out of the mist, curious if we would see any change. Glad that I did, as just as we were at the border, the Dawn essence had started stirring, trying to wake him up. A frown appeared on my face as I noticed the movement of the essence was too controlled to be reflective. </p><p>Far better than someone in the essence realm should be able to achieve. </p><p>Suddenly, I was very glad that I didn’t decide to experiment on myself. Whatever was going on with him was not something ordinary. The mist was even scarier than I assumed. I didn’t know if it was the first steps of actual possession, or something subtler, but either way, it was not good news. </p><p>“I need to find a way to isolate the mist,” I muttered even as I stayed at the edge and used some formation patterns, checking to see if I could isolate its effect on my essence, but the first several attempts I had didn’t work. It was true even when I tried to combine it with the defenses of my boat. </p><p>I had some ideas that might have helped, but it required more time than I had. Not only I had to return to the camp before people woke up and noticed three people had been kidnapped and replaced by illusions, but also I needed to plan for my own death. </p><p>Now that I had a better way to access the camp, I didn’t need to participate in the training. </p><p>Luckily, I had a very easy method. The bully. I had deliberately reinforced his martial arts essence significantly, even pushing him to the edge of a breakthrough. I placed my captives on their beds, then moved onto mine. </p><p>From there, the rest of the process went quite smoothly. When the trainers woke me up, I ‘accidentally’ hit the bully. He decided to respond with a punch. Unfortunately for him, I triggered his breakthrough at that exact moment, and he misjudged his strength, I threw myself back just as his fist brushed my chest, a small formation already in there to create an illusion of a bleeding chest. </p><p>From their perspective, my whole chest had been shredded, including my heart, making it impossible to be cured. </p><p>“Quick, bring an apothecary,” the guards shouted while looking at their agent angrily. The agent in question was sweating bullets, realizing that he had just killed a very valuable prodigy. </p><p>The rest of the commotion had been equally simple. Multiple apothecaries arrived, trying to somehow fix me, but failed. “Call for a cultivator. Maybe they can —” one of the apothecaries started. I decided to tweak the illusion formation a bit to cease the last signs of life. </p><p>No need to make a cultivator suspicious just in the hope of getting an alchemical pill. Not when I already had the knowledge and the ability to refine one. </p><p>“Throw him to the graveyard, and punish that moron strongly,” one of the apothecaries said. “What a waste of talent.” </p><p>“Let’s not punish him too hard. The others will only work harder if they think they might be the next one to die,” another apothecary replied even as the servants dragged me away. </p><p>Just like that, a young and promising recruit had died and forgotten. </p><p>And, ten minutes later, that dead recruit was flying to Markas, ready to interrogate someone that was intimately familiar with the Misty Mountains. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Memorizing the Everdawn Fist hadn’t taken too long. It was not a complicated martial art, clearly designed for foot soldiers and ordinary recruits. Meanwhile, Everdawn Saber was trickier and demanding, both in terms of essence purity, and the complication of the techniques, designed for the elites. </p><p>That part hadn’t been a surprise. I had already seen others practicing the Everdawn Fist, and that had been a clear process. What had been a surprise was to access the next sections of the fist art, which had been referred to as the second-rate martial artist, roughly equivalent to the Foundation Establishment. </p><p>It was an interesting read. </p><p>Up until now, everything I had learned about martial arts was about generating martial arts essence of a certain nature before using that energy to activate certain parts of the body. Starting with muscle, moving to skin, and then the bones. The ultimate step was the Connate realm, which was activating and linking the eight gates of the body. </p><p>Only after having access to the next stage, did I truly understand it was just the preparatory steps for the next move. Once reaching the peak of the Connate realm, the martial artist required a build-up of the essence to a high degree, and purifying their essence to a certain degree before triggering a transformation. </p><p>A transformation that actually required some kind of feedback from the spiritual totem of the martial arts. One section that had been missing from my Everdawn Saber. </p><p>There was no description of the exact method of attaining that feedback, just some vague terms like accepting the sovereignty of the Empire and loyalty being rewarded. That second, I didn’t spend much time. </p><p>I was more interested in the following section, describing the methods of the next stage. It was about binging essence into blood rather than leaving it as an ephemeral object. “Interesting,” I muttered. Turning blood into blood essence was not simply about having a more superior energy delivery method, but also to bind the martial artist with the essence irrevocably. </p><p>That process explained why the conspirators had been obsessed with finding people with no martial arts experience. Essence left some kind of mark as they used. It was a subtle thing that was not a problem for me — even without my extreme apothecary skills to cleanse it — since I didn’t practice those styles for years like any other expert, but any other martial artists, it would have been dangerous during the blood essence realm. </p><p>Commitment to one martial art seemed like a dangerous thing, making the fist art useless for any practical purposes. </p><p>Luckily, I had no intention of playing with it in the first place. I wanted to get the fist art mostly to have a method of comparison, to see if there was a trap buried in the Everdawn Saber. </p><p>Well, more accurately, to see what kind of trap was buried. The existence of it was obvious at this point, but I needed to understand its exact nature if I were to with that mysterious being behind the stone door. </p><p>As I compared the two, I decided that the greatest difference lay in the parts about the spiritual pillar during the breakthrough. There were several critical steps missing in the Everdawn Saber version. I just didn’t know why that section was missing. The possibilities were endless. Maybe the being wanted me to go back and beg for their help once the breakthrough failed. </p><p>Or maybe, it would give them a chance for possession. </p><p>A difficult challenge, particularly since I had to have a meeting with them. Soon. Not wanted to, but had to. </p><p>I still had no idea about the objective of the conspiracy. I had scoured the library twice, but I wasn’t able to find anything about their strategy, or the nature of the spiritual pillars. The sources in the outer library were limited. </p><p>A difficult choice lay before me. Was it easier to infiltrate the inner sanctum first, where multiple cultivators, including at least a few foundation establishment cultivators, resided, or was it safer to visit one of the kingdoms first? </p><p>“Inner sanctum it is,” I muttered. Technically, it was easier to return to the capital and confront that being under a formation, but it was a trick that could go awry if I didn’t know the right questions to ask. Comparatively, sneaking into the inner sanctum was the easier option. </p><p>Especially since the formation had been designed to allow anyone carrying the correct identity plate to pass unhindered. Faking the reaction had been easy enough. </p><p>Once passed, my attention had been grabbed by a small formation right at the center. One that was radiating some kind of fascinating energy. One that I didn’t recognize immediately even with my knowledge, but it wasn’t a surprise. It was an advanced formation, one that was even more complicated than the Golden Core formation I had dealt with before. The condensed lines of Qi had been wrapping around something I couldn’t detect. </p><p>Yet, its function, I couldn’t understand. It was independent of the detection formation, which meant it had nothing to do with the protection or detection. It didn’t even feel like it was properly anchored to the location. And, it was currently inactive. </p><p>It was fascinating enough that, rather than going directly to the library, I approached it, listening to the mutterings of the guards to understand its purpose. Soon, I learned its function. </p><p>Teleportation. </p><p>I pulled back the moment I learned that fact. The existence of such a potential was fascinating, but scary at the same time. Even with all my formation knowledge, I couldn’t begin to imagine how such a thing was possible. </p><p>Its existence was scary for another reason. Whoever created it was clearly not an ordinary Golden Core cultivator … though, considering the sections that I couldn’t detect, it was a chance that they were not a Golden Core cultivator in the first place. </p><p>The conspiracy was even more dangerous than I had first presumed. I didn’t know the true value of such a formation, but I didn’t have the slightest doubt that such a formation was a treasure that was more valuable than the whole mortal domain. </p><p>I moved forward. There was no library in the inner sanctum, but by breaking every building that was currently not occupied by a foundation establishment cultivators, which had several valuable benefits. </p><p>One of them was the notes about Everdawn Fist. A deep treatise with a lot of interesting points about the nature of the spiritual pillar, whether it was the Empire itself was the pillar, or the Emperor. It had been going a long way about the concept of providence, which was some kind of fate energy of the world itself. </p><p>I might have written that as another name for Qi, but at this point, I had encountered too many coincidences not to believe some kind of different somehow sentient force was driving things. </p><p>What truly interesting was not the existence of such an energy, but the mention of some experiments that the author had conducted to understand the nature of it, and how it was linked with the Everdawn Fist. He seemed to be convinced that spiritual pillars were inartistically linked to providence. </p><p>Most of them had been inconclusive, and the ones that had seemingly succeeded couldn’t be trusted, because his understanding of Everdawn fist — and martial arts in general — had several subtle but dangerous flaws. </p><p>Still, one thing was clear. His experiments had mentioned one fact several times, almost as a throwaway line. That providence and the land were linked as well. </p><p>A vague statement among pages and pages of writing, one that I might have missed if it wasn’t for one thing. The martial arts somehow used providence, and the being that was trapped behind the stone door had given me Everdawn Saber. </p><p>It explained why I wasn’t able to find what exactly the stone gates were responsible for. I had checked for Qi for essence, but I couldn’t check for providence. </p><p>That also explained why cultivators actually paid attention to the gates so much, yet they didn’t assign anyone truly strong and let the mortals actually handle it. Fate and providence seemed like topics even cultivators didn’t dare to intervene too deeply. </p><p>Unfortunately, most of the other papers had been about details I had already deduced, like how to increase the cultivation of the new recruits. The plans had confirmed what I was already guessing. They had recruited the current batch in the hopes of using us as trainers and leaders for the second batch. There were a lot of papers detailing the numbers, as raising more than a hundred thousand martial artists in the Blood Essence realm was a significant logistical challenge even for cultivators. </p><p>Too bad there was no convenient plan lying around to tell what they would do once they raised their army. </p><p>The only other thing that had been interesting was the copy of a historical map. It was an incomplete map of the Everdawn Empire, filled with various notes. </p><p>First, it was the extent of the borders. Not only the whole mortal domain had been a part of it, but it was a mere corner of the great expanse. </p><p>The second, instead of misty mountains, was a huge plain that represented the center of the Everdawn Empire, with its old capital right in the middle of the misty mountains. </p><p>I doubted that it was a coincidence. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I woke up at dawn. And, a quick bath later, I rushed to downstairs — my room was conveniently above the workshop — feeling very enthusiastic to work. Normally, I would say that my work ethics weren’t driven by external factors, and it was true … to an extent. </p><p>But, not only my new employer was far more generous than I expected, giving me a higher salary and assistance for leveling up, but also I was doing something other than just following the instructions of my skill. </p><p>A better salary, incredible benefits, and more fulfilling work… </p><p>While I was still a researcher at heart, and saw my class as more of an impediment than a career like the rest of the world seemed to, I had to admit, that those perks made suffering far more acceptable. I was ready to work — </p><p>Only for that enthusiasm to fade immediately I arrived at the workshop and found a scrap of paper waiting for me. One that had only one line. </p><p>‘We advise you to find a different job,’ the paper read. Next to the paper, there was a fat-looking pouch. I was tempted to touch it, but instead, I waved to one of the camp workers. “Please inform Lady Eleanor that there’s an emergency at the forge,” I said. </p><p>He looked unhappy about my intervention, but it wasn’t the first time I worked with people. I delivered the order confidently before going back in, implying that it was only expected for him to follow my requests. With the camp already in flux, he followed. </p><p>While waiting for her, I pondered about the message. I didn’t want to dismiss it out of hand, as it was clear that I found myself in a messy situation. Before the Cataclysm, such a thing might mean character assassination in the media. In this new world order, the character part was not relevant. </p><p>I wasn’t entirely happy about the risk, but the uselessness of previous efforts taught me that I couldn’t avoid risk without accepting I would live an ignoble, unremarkable life, seeped in utter boredom. </p><p>I wasn’t ready to accept it. </p><p>It was why I called Eleanor — one of the two I knew at the camp — and the more relevant party when it came to threats. She was responsible for the camp security, and I preferred to coordinate with her rather than ignoring it. She was the closest thing to a cop, and I rather not touch the evidence before she arrived. </p><p>As for why I was a target, it was obvious. I had just solved one of their biggest logistical challenges, and clearly, it was not a secret. </p><p>She arrived five minutes later. “I hope there’s something important. We need you working,” she said, frustrated. I could see that the challenge of running the camp below the ideal population was getting to her. </p><p>“This was waiting for me when I arrived,” I said, pointing at the paper and the small pouch. </p><p>She said nothing, but her frown tightened. She pointed at it, a slight glow on her to suggest she was able to use magic as well. “You haven’t touched it, right?” </p><p>“No, I thought it’s better to leave it to an expert.” </p><p>“Good call,” she said even as she used her sword to put the parchment into a small bag, then checked the pouch. “It would have burned the moment you touched. Though, I’m impressed you’re able to refuse the bribe. Fifty gold coins is not a small amount.” I gulped at hearing that. “Having second thoughts,” she said. </p><p>“No. I’m just afraid of what they’ll do next if their first move is to bribe me with what I was making for more than a year,” I replied. Unfortunately, it was not an exaggeration. I was certainly startled. </p><p>She paused. “Don’t walk around without your armor, and stay out of the shadows,” she said. I nodded. It was a smart choice. At least, it wasn’t as uncomfortable after my leveling. Also, I was surprised by the ease I accepted the risk of a possible assassination. But then, violence had become a far more acceptable method of dispute resolution since the Cataclysm. </p><p>Assassinations, duels, muggings, bandits… A lack of a central government was already showing its impact. </p><p>“Anything else?” I asked. </p><p>“No. I’ll post two guards to defend the workshop just in case. They’ll also bring your food. Stay inside, and start working.” </p><p>“Any idea about the daily target?” </p><p>“As much as you can manage. The dungeon operations will slow down until the next batch of recruits arrives, but it won’t stop completely. Until we can hire more Blacksmiths, you’re the only one that can keep us going.” </p><p>“I’ll do my best,” I said, making a mental note to take stock once I took a break. Eleanor walked back. “You forgot something,” I said, pointing at the pouch still sitting at the anvil. </p><p>“No, I didn’t. Take it as a bonus for your loyalty.” With that, she left. </p><p>I checked the pouch, only to find out that she was right. Fifty gold coins, a fortune. Being richer was certainly nice, but it only made me more stressed. It meant that their enemies were willing to spend fifty gold just for a chance to weaken the camp and slow down the dungeon.</p><p>”No risk it, no biscuit,” I said to myself, repeating the motto I had decided the day before. At least, I was benefiting greatly from the risks I was taking. It could have been much worse. Many people had died for much smaller rewards. </p><p>Fifty gold represented a lot of things. New skills. Better equipment. And, most importantly, enough money to throw around to get a position in one of the new research institutes, at least as an intern. </p><p>But first, I needed to work. I first focused on bringing the forge to an ideal temperature. Only when the heat hit my face hard enough to feel like I was burning, I grabbed a damaged sword, and started working. </p><p>[-1 Health]</p><p>The occasional consumption of health was much easier to ignore after almost tripling my reserves. The sword heated up quickly, and my hammer danced. “Fascinating,” I muttered even as I felt the metal reshape under my blows. Yesterday, I used every scrap of knowledge I had gathered over the last three years to reduce the repair time to fifteen minutes. </p><p>Now, it finished in four minutes, mostly because I didn’t need to reheat the sword again. With my increased level, I was able to complete the task in one attempt. </p><p>It was more due to increased Dexterity than Strength. It wasn’t that the latter was useless, but for the task of reforging an edge, the added control was far more useful. </p><p>An hour later, I was looking at fifteen swords that had been repaired to pristine condition. “Now, what to do?” I found myself asking. I could slow down intentionally, but that would make it problematic if they noticed my intentional reduction. </p><p>And, the better I performed, the more I could demand.</p><p>With that decision made, I continued to work, pushing my attention to the limit. It was quite tiring. One disadvantage of not following the instruction of the skill, that it was mentally exhausting. I couldn’t just let my wander and let my skill handle the hard work. </p><p>But, with hard work, came an unexpected reward. </p><p>[Repair (Common) - 24 -&gt; 25]</p><p>[Perk Options — Warm Blow / Efficient Repair / Inspect (Analyze)] </p><p>“Huh,” I muttered as the notification popped without a warning, informing me that my Repair had been improved ahead of schedule, giving me multiple dilemmas. </p><p>The most obvious dilemma was which perk to choose from. Warm Blow was the most obvious choice, which would boost my ability to repair the swords even faster. With it, there was a chance I could further cut it in half. </p><p>Efficient Repair was also useful, providing me with a chance to make a living even after leaving the camp. I didn’t even know that Efficient Repair was offered in Level twenty-five again. If I knew, I might have committed to a different plan — not that I was complaining. </p><p>Ultimately, however, I chose Inspect, the advanced version of Analyze, which was supposed to provide with even more information. I might have chosen differently a couple days ago, but now that my earlier commitment to Analyze had proven its benefits, I decided to lean on it. </p><p>But, even as I made that choice, my mind moved to the next implications. Namely, the speed it had managed out reach the next stage, far ahead of schedule. </p><p>It was enough to throw my earlier model of skill improvement. Worse, I had no idea about what was responsible. Maybe my leveling allowed it to get to the next stage. Or, maybe it was just the quality of the weapons that allowed me to improve them, as I had been repairing them at a far faster pace. </p><p>But also I was not completely repairing them based on the suggestion of my Repair skill, which should have slowed down the process. </p><p>“What a fascinating question,” I muttered as I smirked, feeling excited. I couldn’t answer it alone, but soon, I would have multiple experimental candidates who would work directly for me. </p><p>What better opportunity to actually collect some data to build a better model. I had tried to collect that information before, but self-reporting was notoriously unreliable. </p><p>I didn’t expect to discover anything new, as I had no doubt many people had been working on how skills worked. The direct benefit of such knowledge was too important. Unfortunately, the importance also meant that it stayed a secret. There were many differing public opinions, but gossip was different from than scientific process. </p><p>“Finally, a chance for proper scientific study,” I muttered in excitement. It wasn’t exactly the way I preferred. I rather work on the mathematical models and conceptual designs while my doctorate students deal with the boring experimental stuff, but at this point, I would take even the most boring experiment over the monotony of repairing the same weapon over and over. </p><p>I was actually starting to like my new weapon. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I had a new armor, a new uncommon fighting skill that increased my fighting capabilities significantly, and there was even a proper warhammer on my back. Unfortunately, none of them helped against the challenge I was about to face. </p><p>Another flight. This time, with my new boss. </p><p>I said nothing as I climbed my part of the saddle, and grabbed the leather hard, glad that she wasn’t particularly observant. I didn’t exactly enjoy talking to people about my anxieties, and even if I did, my new boss was not exactly the ideal target. </p><p>“Ready?” she asked as she climbed with far better grace. </p><p>“Yes, my lady,” I replied. I might find the sudden shift back to feudalism ridiculous, but my feelings weren’t strong enough to risk annoying my new boss who could successfully imitate a flame thrower. And, admittedly, the fact that what they paid me for a day’s effort was more than I made in three years helped quite a bit as well. </p><p>“Good,” she said as she commanded the griffin, and once again, we were suffering an unnatural, disgusting act that humans weren’t supposed to experience. I took a deep breath, ignoring the vertigo as we flew, Maria easily took down any flying beast that dared to drift closer. </p><p>I expected her not to deign to speak to me. I was wrong. “Do you play chess?” she asked without a preamble. </p><p>I sighed. Even when dealing with vertigo, I could understand her aim. While my earlier trick with the math lesson convinced her that I knew what I was doing, it also annoyed her. She wanted to prove herself. </p><p>“Yes. I was a high-ranking master before the Cataclysm,” I replied, doing my best to sound proud rather than frustrated. My past with the chess had been rather checkered. It was a fun game, but I had always hated how people equated it as a shortcut to prove how smart they were. And, as a genius who started teaching at a premier college younger than almost all of my students, I had been challenged many times, forcing me to learn more just to stay on top. </p><p>After the Cataclysm, it got worse. Suddenly, playing chess to prove capabilities turned common. Intelligence stat allowed people to make calculations faster and multitask better, a devastating advantage for chess. I was quick to stop playing after that. I wasn’t entirely free of competitiveness, and being demolished every time I played was not fun. </p><p>But, it looked like it was about to change. </p><p>“Do you want to play blind chess to pass the time?” she asked, her enthusiasm clear. </p><p>“Of course,” I answered, doing my best to fake enthusiasm. She just asked, but I decided to take it as an order. If all it took to be demolished in a few chess games to get her in a good mood, I was more than happy to make that sacrifice. </p><p>Especially if it distracted me from the fact that I was in the air. I closed my eyes. “Pawn, e4,” I said. A classical move, one that led to many of the classic openings. A few moves later, I had a significant advantage. Not only did I have absolute control of the center, but also I was ahead of a pawn. </p><p>Unfortunately, that advantage was temporary. My knowledge of openings gave me a great advantage during the first ten moves, but the moment the game settled, that advantage started to dwindle. A knight cut through the side in an unexpected move, but every attempt I made to defend pulled me deeper into the quagmire. </p><p>I sighed as I tried to come up with a good move, but failed repeatedly. Most of the moves she had made felt ridiculous. Her fundamentals were horrible, and the strategic implications didn’t matter. </p><p>Unfortunately, none of those mattered when she simply could outthink me, like she was using a computer to calculate her moves. I felt like a sickly boxer fighting against a giant. I held the advantage in technique, but it didn’t matter against an enemy that could shatter my bones with each move. </p><p>“I surrender,” I called in frustration in move fifty, about twenty moves after my defeat had been set in stone. In any chess tournament, such a move would have been derided as pointless pride, but Maria clearly enjoyed taking my pieces one by one to lord over her superiority. </p><p>“Good game,” she said, her voice far more cheerful. “Another one.” </p><p>“It won’t be easy this time,” I replied, doing my best to sound confident. Luckily, Maria wasn’t observant enough to understand I was indulging her with fake competitiveness. </p><p>As I started with another classic move, I wondered if there was a chance to make it more fun. Maybe if I could tailor my game against her. Not to win. No, that part was truly hopeless. But, I could try and optimize my game to counter her advantages as much as possible, and lose gracefully. </p><p>Also, any distraction from my current activity was a welcome bonus. </p><p>For the next several games, I focused on the way she played, trying to reverse-engineer the approach. While she played very good chess, it was very different from playing a chess grandmaster. It wasn’t even like playing against a chess engine. It was more like the reverse. Bad strategic moves, only to be resolved through sheer creativity until I found myself in a position that was impossible to comprehend based on any sane application of chess theory. </p><p>It was not a complete surprise. I had already known how Intelligence worked thanks to my previous research — at least in general terms — and I had played with other people with Intelligence until it became too frustrating. </p><p>However, it didn’t make two people would play chess the same way. Strength allowed people to hit harder, but people still had their own fighting style. Some chose relentless direct assault, while others fought carefully, and defensively. </p><p>Maria, to my absolute lack of surprise, belonged to the first category. She started slow, probably to enjoy her upcoming victory, but the moment she started playing seriously, she delivered attack after attack. I tried to trap her, but her Intelligence made it easy to catch them. </p><p>“And, checkmate,” she called as we landed, smiling smugly. “That makes it, thirteen to zero.” </p><p>“I’ll get you the next time,” I fake-growled, trying to convince her that her victories bothered me. To be fair, they would have … but it was bliss compared to focusing on the silent torture of flying. Playing against her required my full focus, distracting me from the fact that we were floating. </p><p>“We will see. We still have the return flight,” she said. </p><p>I looked around, taking note of our surroundings. An empty plain, with no human in sight. Instead, there were a lot of monsters. Some vaguely looked like animals, as if they were painted by an impressionist painter who was suffering from a drug overdose, while the others vaguely looked humanoid. </p><p>A nightmarish horde that was currently gathering toward us. </p><p>“I’m going to burn them until they can’t move. Just walk through the piles and smash them,” she said, utterly calm. </p><p>I couldn’t blame her, not when she easily destroyed a hundred creatures with a wave of her hand, leaving mostly cinders. I moved forward immediately. </p><p>It was a great opportunity. </p><p>I stood in front of the first beast, a giant wolf immobilized thanks to its incinerated limbs, my hammer rose and fell. It was a familiar move, one that came from my Overhead Strike skill. I was glad that my new Uncommon skill had a similar move, allowing me to adapt with ease. </p><p>My hammer fell with far greater impact than I was used to, showing the difference between the two skills. The difference between the two tiers was not for nothing. </p><p>“Move faster, we don’t have all day,” she shouted. </p><p>“Sorry, boss. New skill jitters,” I replied even as I moved. Only when I was smashing the third one, I realized that I hadn’t used the more formal call. “Sorry, my lady,” I said, not wanting to annoy her. </p><p>“I like the boss better. Use it when we’re alone,” she replied, laughing. </p><p>I smiled as well. She wasn’t nearly as unbearable as the first impression suggested once she warmed up. I smashed two more immobile beasts, and a notification arrived. </p><p>[Hammer of Might (Uncommon) 1 -&gt; 2]</p><p>“Fascinating,” I muttered. It was not easy to raise skill proficiency levels, or my overhead strike wouldn’t have lagged merely at four. However, the basics were hardly a secret. Skills leveled up more based on external feedback than anything internal. </p><p>For example, using more precious materials made [Forge] improve faster, and the better — and more damaged — the target weapon, the faster [Repair] developed. </p><p>And, for combat skills, the stronger the beast that had been killed, the easier they leveled up. Their damaged state reduced the feedback significantly. It was hard to gauge, but the first wolf alone probably improved the skill by two stages, and maybe even given me an actual level as well.</p><p>Though, considering it would have ripped me apart easily, I was more than happy to take the reduced feedback. I killed a few more until the System responded once more. </p><p>[Level 7 -&gt; 8]</p><p>[+2 Vitality, +2 Strength,, +1 Dexterity]</p><p>[Hammer of Might (Uncommon) 2 -&gt; 3]</p><p>“I have just leveled up,” I informed her. As much as hiding it was tempting, I didn’t forget her casually using a spell to check my level. No need to take risks for small benefits, particularly since she was so generous while helping me. </p><p>“Faster than I expected. Very good,” she said. “Let’s see if we can bring you to your first threshold,” she called. </p><p>That made me gasp. The first threshold was level twenty-five. And, in three years, I was merely level seven. Yes, I didn’t prioritize it, but that didn’t make the gap any less impressive. </p><p>“Yes, boss,” I replied, tightening my grip on my new warhammer, and moving between targets. There was no heroics, no unexpected developments, nothing. Just a steady massacre of monsters without even bothering to harvest one, leaving material that was potentially worth hundreds of gold. Or, would have been if they weren’t burnt to cinders, and we had the ability to carry them back to the camp. </p><p>Soon, however, I realized another problem. Maria was getting bored. Understandable. While it was a thrilling activity that strengthened me significantly, it represented nothing but boredom for her. </p><p>“Pawn D3,” I suddenly called. </p><p>“E6,” she replied, her boredom replaced by some amusement. Constant defeats were not fun, but I was more than happy to accept it if it allowed me to level up rapidly. And, it helped me to analyze her playing style even more. The more we played, the better I fared. </p><p>When she finally called a stop, it was already dusk. “Let’s move back. It’s not safe to hunt during the night.” </p><p>I wanted to argue against it, but my arms were hurting too much to argue. Even with the System, there were limits to my endurance. “Yes, boss,” I called instead. And, it wasn’t like I had any right to complain. </p><p>- </p><p>[Blacksmith - Level 22]</p><p>[Health 660/660]</p><p>[Vitality 44 / Strength 44 / Dexterity 22]</p><p>[Skills (3/8)</p><p>Repair (Common) - 24 [Analyze]</p><p>Forge (Common) - 8 </p><p>Hammer of Might (Uncommon) - 7]</p>",

    "content": "<p>I examined the camp as I moved forward. As far as I could see, the camp population had dropped significantly to something around two hundred, which no doubt made any dungeon incursion a bigger challenge. Even working overtime, most of that number had to be dedicated to camp defense, which probably ruined any chance of making decent progress with the dungeon until the reinforcement Rosie promised arrived. </p><p>Though, I had a feeling that Rosie would offer them another batch of recruits, naturally with some premium for emergency recruitment. But, I kept my mouth about that. Whatever deal they had was between them. </p><p>I just wanted to make some money. And, maybe, get a few skills in the process. </p><p>We soon arrived at the largest building. “Wait here,” she said as she went inside with the swords. I said nothing, ignoring the hesitant glances of the camp visitors, no doubt wanting to ask the newest face some questions. </p><p>Their anxiety was understandable, but I deliberately avoided their gazes, not giving anyone a chance to interact. Whatever that was going on was complicated enough to make sticking my head — any more than I already would once I started churning out a ridiculous amount of swords, at least — an unwise choice. </p><p>“You can come in,” Eleanor said when the door opened once more. “Lady Maria is ready to see you.” </p><p>I nodded and followed her, taking note of the decorations. It was well-furnished. Much better than what I would expect in a camp in the middle of nowhere. Either Maria was even more spoiled than I had assumed, or her family was even richer. </p><p>Either way, a bigger trouble. </p><p>I refrained from sighing in despair even as Eleanor led me to an office that was filled with parchments, leather-bound books, and many glowing objects, all clearly enchanted. </p><p>“Eleanor tells me that you can repair five times faster than our other blacksmiths. How?” she asked, trying to look serious and in control. She wasn’t particularly successful. Luckily for her, the memory of her burning multiple monsters with a wave of her hand was more than enough to compensate. </p><p>I thought about breaking down the process, and dumbing it down to the most understandable piece, but after some consideration, I decided against it. She didn’t seem like someone who would appreciate anything she could understand. </p><p>“May I ask how familiar you are with math, my lady. I’m using some scientific methods to expand the benefits of the skill. It allows me to bypass some of the steps given by the Repair skill.” </p><p>“And you know it works, how?” she asked, the challenge in her tone clear. </p><p>The answer was simple trial and error, but I had a feeling that she wouldn’t appreciate it. “A proper explanation of some detailed formulas. May I proceed with it?” I asked. </p><p>I caught a hint of panic on her face before she looked frustrated. “I was a college senior when the Cataclysm hit, and more importantly, I’m a Fire Mage. With Intelligence, I can easily understand anything a mere Blacksmith could come up with.” </p><p>Her confident declaration made me even more confident about my choice. I paused for a moment, remembering some of the formulas I had read in the journals I had found. Formulas were nothing more than intellectual curiosity as they were mostly random, scattered articles with no proper link. </p><p>Still, they were good enough to dazzle an overconfident student whose understanding of math probably ended up in algebra, and Intelligence was not useful in understanding completely unfamiliar concepts. </p><p> “Let’s start with a simple basis. JMA equation for recrystallization process of metals. The formula is simple.” I paused for a moment, jotting down the first formula. </p><p> [X(t) = 1 - exp[-(kt)^n] </p><p>“X represents the volume fraction of the material of transformation, t represents time, k is constant, and n represents an exponential of dimensionless number that reflects the dimensionality of the growth and nucleation behavior during the transformation…” </p><p>She tried to hide it, but I taught for years. The glassy expression of a student who had lost track was too familiar to miss. Under any other situation, I would have slowed down, and explained every concept one by one. This time, I threw more and more complicated concepts. </p><p>I wasn’t good enough in material sciences, but dragging the discussion to a more pure math basis wasn’t too hard. Fifteen minutes later, I was deep into a small, confusing lecture on the fifth-order differential equation and their effectiveness in solving wave propagation. </p><p>“Enough, I have got the gist of it,” Maria cut in, unable to keep her frustration. “The math looks solid, and Eleanor already confirmed the weapons are good enough. So, go ahead and start teaching the others how to do it. We’ll need a lot of swords soon.” </p><p>I was about to cut in, when Eleanor cut in first. “We currently don’t have any other Blacksmith in the camp, madam.” </p><p>“How? Only the six of them were under family contract.” </p><p>“Yes, but we still hired the others through the usual channels. That contract has the escape clauses. They … they decided to pay it off.” </p><p>“They paid fifty gold each,” Maria gasped. “That bastard must have given it. Can’t we …” </p><p>“We don’t have evidence,” she said. </p><p>“I’m sure Rosie could find a few more experts in emergency. They don’t need Level 25 Repair. As long as they have Analyze, I can teach them,” I offered. I thought about asking Maria for a bonus, but I chose against it. I had already annoyed her enough. I could talk to Eleanor about it. “But, I can’t repair all day,” I said. </p><p>“Why? You already signed the contract,” Maria said. </p><p>“Because my level is not high enough. Four hours already drained most of my Health. I need to be higher level.” </p><p>“That’s easy,” Maria said, looking at Eleanor. “Where’s the closest wild spot we could visit,” she asked. </p><p>“But, I can’t leave the camp with the guards gone, and we don’t have any guards strong enough to help him.” </p><p>“Doesn’t matter. I’ll help him,” Maria replied. “I can’t stay here and defend the camp without depleting our mana potions. Just escort him to the armory and give him armor. I don’t want him dead.” </p><p>“I will do as you wish. Should I arrange for an escort—” </p><p>“No, I don’t need any,” she replied, her tone final. Eleanor looked frustrated. Maria sighed. “You know we can’t afford any. Not unless we are willing to clean the dungeon entrance again.” </p><p>Eleanor sighed. “You’re right, but I don’t like it,” she said. Then, she turned to me. “Follow me,” she said. </p><p>I followed as she brought me to the basement, which was filled with weapons and armor. Most of it was the type the guards had been wearing, but a few of them looked better. “I don’t have to tell you that if anything happens to her…” </p><p>“I understand,” I said. I didn’t appreciate being threatened, especially since Maria was far stronger than me, but it was not exactly a helpful conversation to have. Instead, I focused on something more productive. “My contract doesn’t have anything to do with teaching,” I reminded her. </p><p>“You want more money,” she said, her tone not exactly welcoming. </p><p>“That would help, but I have something else in mind. Something that could help your side as well.” </p><p>“What do you need?” she said. </p><p>“I need books from before the Cataclysm,” I replied. “Preferably about material science, manufacturing, and similar topics, but I’m alright with anything. If it has numbers, it might help.” </p><p>“What’s the point?” she said. </p><p>“Well, you have seen my trick with repairing the edge. I can only do that because my calculations gave me the ideal temperature to work on the edge. There’s a chance I can find an even better method as long as I have the necessary material.” </p><p>“And, you can do that as a Blacksmith,” she said. </p><p>I shrugged. “I have a Doctorate in Math,” I said, giving her a simplified version of my background. No need to muddle it with my other expertise. “And, unlike what most people claim, math can still be useful.” </p><p>“Not as useful as skills,” Eleanor replied. </p><p>“Probably,” I said. I strongly disagreed, but after three years of having the same conversation many times, I was bored of explaining to people why it was ridiculous to restrict themselves to the System just because it was easier. “But, I’m assuming you don’t have one of those useful skills, or you would have already given it to your old blacksmiths.” </p><p>“Well, no,” she said. “Skill stones for production classes are hard to find. The System Store hardly stocks them, and they rarely drop from dungeons.” </p><p>I sighed. I certainly know that, which was a pity, because the biggest advantage of production classes was having more skill slots. Another unfair detail, of many. “So, that’s why I’m asking for books. I assume it won’t be too difficult for you. Even I was able to collect some, and I live in a small town.” </p><p>“Probably, I need to check it,” she said. “But, meanwhile, we can discuss your salary —” </p><p>“No, I rather leave it to Rosie,” I replied, cutting it short. The situation was too complicated for me to navigate. I didn’t even know what kind of money I could ask for. “But, I wouldn’t say no to a combat skill if you have any.” </p><p>“You use hammers, right?” she said. “You’re lucky. We have one uncommon hammer skill. We also have several uncommon sword style variants if you’re interested,” she added. </p><p>“For now, it’s better if I stick to hammer,” I said. It was better to stick to one weapon, especially since it paired better with my class stats. However, I was fascinated by the casual manner she pulled a glowing rock from a box and threw it at me. </p><p>[Skill Stone: Hammer of Might (Uncommon)]</p><p>As the notification popped, I was glad that I chose to bargain with Eleanor rather than Maria. She was certainly the more generous one. Not for no reason, as I had just solved their biggest logistic challenge, but I knew many that would spit on my face rather than listen to it. </p><p>I was more than happy. </p><p>I closed my eyes, absorbing it slowly.</p><p>[Overhead Strike (Basic) 4 -&gt; Hammer of Might (Uncommon) 1]</p><p>I groaned. It was the second time I was absorbing a skill stone — since repair and forge had come with the Blacksmith class — but replacing a similar skill felt much more different. It was dizzying and painful. I barely registered Eleanor checking several armors to find one that would fit to my size. </p><p>Absorbing skills were painful. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Sneaking to a mage was not a good idea even under the ideal circumstances. Having the said mage in a tense patrol while she was under the impression that her strongest ally was currently unconscious wasn’t even in the same country as the ideal case. </p><p>Unfortunately, I knew for a fact she would make a loud noise the moment she saw me, unaware that the enemy was already close. She lacked the combat awareness to do anything else. So, I carefully moved to her, ready to throw myself to the side to avoid a reflexive water blade if she mistook me for an enemy. </p><p>That didn’t happen even as I stood behind her, which was … troubling. It was good for the current situation, of course, but I made a note not to trust her as a sentry anytime soon. “Calm down,” I said even as I pressed my hand to her mouth, suppressing her panicked cry. “It’s me, calm down,” I said. She started shaking, tears spilling. I moved to her, afraid that I had scared her. “Sorry. I didn’t want to scare you. I just wanted to make sure we don’t alert the enemy —” </p><p>She silenced me with a kiss, her hug turning even more desperate. “Idiot,” she said as she pulled back, tears spilling. “I’m not scared of it. I thought … I thought you wouldn’t wake up. Why the hell did you decide to start experimenting without asking me to keep an eye on you. I thought that you would die … again!” </p><p>“I’m sorry. I just didn’t expect it to react like that. It felt like a safe experiment,” I said. </p><p>“That’s the point,” she growled even as she interrupted me with a painful poke, but luckily with enough presence of mind to keep herself from shouting. “You are too reckless. It doesn’t matter if you don’t expect anything to go wrong. We don’t know anything about what’s going on, meaning none of our expectations matter. You need to be more careful. What’s the point of taking all that risk to find a priestess and hiding in the middle of nowhere if you’re just recklessly experimenting rather than working on every step.” </p><p>I silenced her with a kiss, mostly because she was starting to forget about my warning about possible enemies. They weren’t close enough to notice us yet — a win for my new senses, which were particularly successful in catching the smell of the shifters — but it didn’t change the fact that we needed to move away. </p><p>Luckily, enhanced senses and strength proved useful in more than one way. I lifted her in a bridal hold, easily carrying her toward the caves at a speed that even a cavalry couldn’t match while kissing her continuously. </p><p>I only stopped kissing her when we arrived at the cave, where Astrid was waiting for us, the little possessions we had with us packed. “That’s all we have,” I asked. </p><p>“Yes,” Lillian said as she stood once more. “We would have more, but we had to carry a certain reckless idiot with us, so…” </p><p>“Sorry about that. I’ll try to be more careful,” I said. </p><p>“Wow, what a strong promise,” she responded with a deadpan tone. I couldn’t help but smirk at her attitude. She was surprisingly cute when she was being grouchy. </p><p>I was ready to tease her about it, but Astrid closed the distance and kissed me without a warning. The situation wasn’t urgent enough to enjoy a kiss from a sexy priestess, particularly one I had been working to seduce — well, more Lillian than me, but the same thing — so I let her have free reign. </p><p>At the same time, I caught Lillian’s gaze. Satisfaction was expected, but I was amused to catch her jealousy as well despite how hard she tried to hide. Interesting. Too bad the situation didn’t allow me to push the situation anymore. </p><p>“As much as I want to spend my time like this, we have to go,” I said. </p><p>“Legionaries closing in?” Astrid asked, tensing. “I thought we would have more time. I was sure that I covered our tracks successfully —” </p><p>“No,” I said as I silenced her with a gaze. Her reaction was understandable. Living at the border, she clearly didn’t have any good memory of legionaries. “Shifters.” </p><p>“Traitors or …” she started, then paused. She clearly realized that, after being forced to leave her tribe, she didn’t have a method of referring to the Germanic side. </p><p>“I don’t know. It might be legion auxiliaries, or it might be a group of raiders that was near enough to notice the commotion. Either way, we need to get away before we’re noticed, and see if we can find a way to slip away.” </p><p>“Do you think we can get away?” Lillian asked, worried. </p><p>“Yes, we have managed to escape from a worse situation. A valley has too many paths for us to escape. They can’t surround the whole valley unless they commit a full legion. They’ll have to concentrate their forces near passages while spreading a few scouts around.” </p><p>“How about if we move to the other side of the valley. They won’t have too many soldiers there.” </p><p>“Good idea, but…” I started, wondering exactly how to put my feelings. “I feel like there’s something at the center of the valley. Something dangerous,” I said. “I have no idea what, but I just know that those new instincts are warning me.” </p><p>“Could it be a herd of third-order beasts?” Lillian asked scared. </p><p>“I doubt it,” I said, and she seemed relaxed. “I’m pretty sure my instincts would have treated it as a challenge instead.” </p><p>“That’s good —” she started, then it clicked. “No, there’s something that’s more dangerous than a herd of third-order beasts! That’s not good at all,” she said. </p><p>“We don’t know,” I answered. “It’s just weird instincts. They don’t exactly come with a handy guide. Maybe it’s something completely different. But, in any case, it feels like whatever is there, it’s slumbering.” </p><p>“Good,” Lillian sighed. “But, that means we need a different plan.” </p><p>“True,” I said. “Now, what are we going to do is to move to the east, hoping to avoid the enemy while finding a path out. Meanwhile, I’ll leave a few false paths leading to the center of the valley instead, and see if the legionaries are willing to go deeper. If there’s anything truly dangerous there, they will stay away. If they don’t, it’s enough to reveal that it’s not too dangerous, and we can pick that direction.” </p><p>“Not a bad plan,” Astrid said. “So, what are we going to do. Run straight toward the edge, or walk.” </p><p>“It’s better if you move at a slower pace. I still need time to scout to understand exactly who we are dealing with, not to mention laying false tracks requires time. We have already lost a day. We can’t just cut through and hope for the best.” </p><p>Well, technically we could. I had no doubt that if I decided to just cut and run, we would be able to get away before they could react as long as I avoided their mages. And, even a full legion didn’t have enough mages to surround a large valley. </p><p>Escaping was one thing, and escaping without being noticed was something else. Even if they didn’t realize the extraordinary nature of my existence, they were here to check the magical irregularity. Escaping while showing some unfamiliar capabilities would only turn us into a target. </p><p>I was happy that I managed to ditch that mysterious organization. The last thing I wanted was to replace them was a full legion. Forty-eight hundred experienced soldiers were scary enough without factoring in a great number of experienced mages, and at least one sorcerer — more depending on the specific legion — all chasing me in the hopes of acquiring a treasure. </p><p>No, I wasn’t ready to just escape, indeed.  </p><p>“We’re going to split up?” Lillian asked, sounding needy. </p><p>I chuckled. “Don’t worry about it. I won’t get too far away,” I guaranteed. “Just try not to use any magic unless it’s an emergency. We need to get away silently unless we want to deal with another army chasing us. And, if you feel my flare of magic, get as far away as possible from the center of the valley, and escape.” </p><p>Lillian grumbled, but still grabbed her bag. “What if we split up?” she asked. </p><p>“Don’t worry, I’ll find you,” I said, confident that I could find them. </p><p>“Alright, follow me,” Astrid said as she looked at Lillian. </p><p>“Why should I follow you?” Lillian responded reflexively. </p><p>“Because only one of us knows how to move properly in the forest. Or did you forget the mess you ended up with when we were escaping…” </p><p>I couldn’t help but chuckle as I left them behind. They were developing a friendship. A very weird one even when discounting their relationship with me, but a friendship nonetheless. </p><p>Too bad I couldn’t stay to watch the entertainment they would provide. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Waking up shouldn’t be a surprise, but considering my last memory was dealing with the mysterious beast vitae that was going out of control, it certainly was. </p><p>Another pleasant surprise, I still had my arm. When I was falling unconscious, I was certain that Lillian would have to amputate it to save me. I took a deep breath, a short celebration that I was still alive, then I opened my eyes. </p><p>I was in a cave, an unfamiliar one. Surprising, I thought even as I shuffled, ready to stand up — </p><p>When my fingers rubbed the floor, I didn’t receive a familiar feeling. It felt like I was wearing a gauntlet … but also it was too responsive for that. Confused, I looked to my left. “Alright, it’s not as bad as losing it,” I muttered, trying to convince myself even as I looked at my new arm. </p><p>Every inch of skin below my elbow was covered with scales, and there were several spotty scales climbing up to my bicep. Though, even more noticeable was my hand, long turned into a claw. A dangerous claw,” I added even as I looked at the floor of the cave, with several deep marks. </p><p>Curious, I brought one finger against the rock, a moderate pressure enough to leave another deep mark. </p><p>However, even as I realized that the transformation had spread much more, I didn’t panic. The greatest reason for it was the feeling it gave. Previously, the scales felt like an infection, foreign and refusing my control. Right now, it felt like a part of my body. </p><p>I barely needed to focus before I could direct the transformation to recede. Just like that, I was looking at an untouched, pristine arm. Even my old scars were gone. </p><p>“I survived again,” I said. Not only that, but I was able to reverse another potential disaster. Still, even with the help of the girls, it was a close call. </p><p>Speaking of the girls, I wondered where they were. They were not in the cave, but one benefit of my enhanced senses, I could smell them, meaning they had been in the cave recently. Curious, I looked around, trying to understand just how long I was unconscious. </p><p>It was dark outside, so I wanted to believe I merely slept several hours, but I had a feeling that I was unconscious longer. Not exactly a comforting thought, because I was certain that the mana density of the valley wasn’t enough to block the commotion of my out-of-control beast vitae. </p><p>I wanted to go out and check them, but I had something more important to focus on first. I closed my eyes, trying to diagnose myself. The first thing I focused on was my heart, with the crystal still lodged in its center. It was a great relief to see that everything was still the same with it. No damage, no growth, nothing. It still radiated the same amount of mana every time it throbbed. </p><p>Unfortunately, that was the only thing that was the same. The surrounding area had been changed completely. The rest of my body had changed significantly. My elemental cores showed further signs of damage, not just the initial puncture, but also many cracks spreading through the surface. </p><p>Other than that, the most notable change was the mana flow. Previously, whenever the mana density had surpassed one point, my whole body had been draining the excess, subtly changing me in the process. Right now, the excess mana directly went to my arm, reinforcing the greedy vitae while transforming my arm completely. Not just the scales, but also the muscles underneath. </p><p>The transformation didn’t scare me too much. It wasn’t like the previous one, fighting with me every step of the way as I tried to control it, but felt more natural. That feeling was more similar to Astrid’s description of the holy warriors. </p><p>Then, I noticed something else. My arm was also generating mana. It took a while for me to notice it, as any mana generated by the scales was drained by my bones, making it difficult to notice. </p><p>It was enough to show that my mana problem had just got much worse. </p><p>“One step at a time,” I said as I stood up, my legs feeling rusty. I ignored it as I walked out, trying to see if my body had any other major changes. Before I could step out, however, Astrid appeared at the entrance. </p><p>“You’re awake,” she gasped in excitement as she covered the distance, her arms wrapping tight around my body. Lost in the moment, she didn’t even register that my arm was black to normal. </p><p>Interesting. Considering just how invested she was in my transformation, I expected a bigger reaction. Yet, she just hugged me, her body trembling. I realized that I might have been unconscious more than I expected. </p><p>“It looks like —” I started, which was all I was able to say before she kissed me desperately, her body smashing against me. Seeing that she didn’t want to speak yet, I surrendered to her. Not exactly a big sacrifice at my party. </p><p>“You’re alive,” she muttered, her arms still tight around my body. “After all this time, we were afraid that you were dead.” </p><p>“Don’t worry, I’m not going anywhere,” I consoled her, surprised by the intensity of her reaction. Even with everything we had done, it was a bit excessive. Then, a reason for such an intense change occurred to me. “How long I had been unconscious?” </p><p>“Almost a day,” she replied, her arms getting even tighter. That explained the location change. “We thought that you won’t wake up.” </p><p>I sighed as I checked the cave we were in, which didn’t show any sign of living that long. “We have been discovered, hadn’t we?” I asked. </p><p>“Yes,” Astrid answered. “The mana flare from your transformation was too noticeable. The legion scouts arrived at the valley almost immediately, forcing us to escape deeper into the valley. Luckily, they didn’t send too many people to search, and Lillian managed to distract the scouts.” </p><p>“I see,” I muttered, doing my best to sound calm, but I tensed. Astrid’s explanation revealed a lot of details, and none of them was good. The first was our location. I had already discovered that there was something dangerous in the depths of the valley, something slumbering. Getting closer to that was not a good idea. </p><p>Luckily, I woke up soon. </p><p>Then, there was the presence of the legionnaires. The fact that they immediately arrived at the valley was not good news. Either they were aware that the source of the mana flare was not a natural treasure and wanted to catch us, or they thought that it was, and wanted to get it before the other forces. </p><p>I sighed. Either way, it was not good news. </p><p>“Where’s Lillian?” I asked. </p><p>“She’s out, making sure our location is not discovered. After my tamed beast died against the scouts, she’s the only one that could fight,” Astrid said, still tense. She didn’t look happy with the admission of her powerlessness. I had a feeling that she would ask my help to get stronger. </p><p>Not exactly a great chore for me. </p><p>“So, you’re an elemental mage,” she added, changing the subject. </p><p>“I … I was. Now, I don’t know what am I,” I said. A statement that reflected my true feelings, one I punctuated by raising my arm, letting my hand switch between a claw and a hand several times in rapid succession. </p><p>“Y-you can control the transformation already,” Astrid said. “It’s supposed to take years. How?” </p><p>I shrugged. “What we have done was enough to erase the emotional imprint on the vitae, allowing me to control it directly.” </p><p>Astrid looked shocked. “How’s this possible?” </p><p>I shrugged. “I have no idea. It was more of an educated guess than anything else. Lillian’s blood ritual worked to calm the essence before, and I bet that my regeneration would handle whatever damage your cleansing spell would create.” </p><p>“So, it was a gamble,” she said. </p><p>“More or less,” I replied. Ultimately, it was not wrong. She looked like she wanted to say anything else, but I silenced her with a gesture. “I’m going to find Lillian and send her back to rest,” I said. </p><p>“Do you think it’s a good idea?” she said. “You just woke up. Maybe you need to rest.” </p><p>“No. I can move around. More importantly, Lillian might be a strong mage, but subtly, she’s not. I need to find her before our location is detected,” I explained. She didn’t seem convinced, but her complaints died when I let my arm transform back to a claw once more. Her reverence toward holy warriors was useful. </p><p>With my advanced senses, finding Lillian was not too hard. She was patrolling half a mile away from the cave, going back and forth in an attempt to catch any possible interloper. A mediocre scouting pattern even under normal conditions, and particularly terrible while trying to escape from a superior force. </p><p>She still had a lot to learn. But, I didn’t have the luxury to teach her. Because, at the distance, I could feel the presence of at least a dozen warriors. </p><p>Shapeshifters, if my sense of smell was halfway accurate. </p><p>It looked like Astrid was wrong. We weren’t dealing with just legionnaires. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Once Astrid’s incredibly misguided yet entertaining attempt to make Lillian pay was complete, I put my pants back on before I sat down with my legs crossed, continuing my meditation. Astrid’s assistance had arrived just in time, removing the mana pressure I had been dealing with. </p><p>But, I expected that to be the only benefit. So, I was surprised when, merely after a minute of meditation, I was able to feel a connection with the scales. It was a weak, almost nonexistent connection, one that barely gave me an awareness of my scales and nothing more. </p><p>Still, it was an incredible benefit. </p><p>“What’s going on,” I muttered as I tried to resolve it … only for it to click me a moment later. All day, I was trying to replicate those foreign instincts by forcing myself to feel angry. </p><p>A mistake, I realized, but only after I realized the reason for my rapid improvement. It might be the easiest way to trigger the dragon heart, but it wasn’t the ideal way. I had lived my life doing my best not to be affected by anger. Even as I deliberately angered myself by thinking of my uncle, it had been a careful, controlled fire, and nothing more. </p><p>Nothing like that primal, restless anger that threatened to devour everything. </p><p>In comparison, I had reveled in my joy and pleasure while Astrid ‘helped’ me, letting my own enjoyment mix with those instincts. Of course, I still didn’t let those foreign instincts rule me fully, but I didn’t treat my own emotions as a danger that needed to be corralled and controlled. </p><p>“Back to the beginning,” I muttered even as I focused on the echo of the scales. Establishing a permanent connection with my vitae, however weak, meant that I was a qualified first-order mage. </p><p>If I were trying to build another elemental core, I would have focused on directing the spread-out vitae into one section before I started meditating, slowly imprinting my thoughts, and perceptions, and pondering on its very structure. That was how one controlled the very elements that created the world. </p><p>A process that took years for my elemental cores. </p><p>Astrid’s explanation told me that the vitae from the beasts needed to be treated differently. Instead of changing and transforming the vitae, a holy warrior needed to let the vitae impact and change them. </p><p>I wasn’t willing to do that. Surrendering to feelings like anger and destruction stood against everything I believed. Against everything I had been trained to embody as a Scipio — even a bastard one. </p><p>“Let’s try something more interesting,” I muttered as I focused on the vitae present in my arm, particularly the scales at the edge. However, this time, I wasn’t trying to reverse the transformation, which, ultimately, was a mere cosmetic change. No, I was forcibly pulling all the vitae from one of the scales. </p><p>The pain was worse than I imagined. Despite my best attempts, a pained gasp escaped my mouth, and something warm started to trail on my arm. I didn’t need to open my eyes to know that it was blood. </p><p>I forced that extracted vitae to form a small orb, one that would function as an elemental vitae. I even succeeded, but I could tell that it wouldn’t last long. Unlike elemental vitae, it refused to be trapped and imprisoned. </p><p>It roared, refusing my control. </p><p>My mana started to gather around it. </p><p>Then, a realization hit me, freezing my heartbeat while I sweated in fear. The vitae was alive in a way I didn’t expect. Not exactly intelligent, more like a rabid, thrashing beast, but intelligent nonetheless. And, I had just alerted it. </p><p>I was glad that Lillian was near. I could feel her presence even without opening my eyes. She was getting closer, no doubt alerted by the sudden bleeding. Hopefully, she would be able to help with her druid tricks. “Call Astrid as well!” I shouted. </p><p>As much as I wanted to keep my secrets from her, the situation was rapidly growing to be too dangerous. </p><p>While waiting for her, the rest of the vitae from my scales rushed to the temporary core I created. The scales on my arm decayed, and my blood drained faster. But, I didn’t care about it. </p><p>The roars of imaginary beasts threatened to deafen me and took all my attention. As those roars rose, so did my heartbeat, pumping more and more mana to my body, while the beast vitae devoured it, growing steadily. </p><p>I had a feeling that, if I let that go on, I would cease to be myself. A great, unimaginable disaster. And, I refused it. I ignored the pain and attacked the mana, taking as much mana as I could gather. And, I started imbuing with my thoughts. </p><p>It was a hasty, hurried affair. Normally, modifying vitae by adding concepts required a calm, careful approach, curating every little detail perfectly. Unfortunately, I didn’t need hours to properly visualize concepts and ideas. I just focused on everything I could feel, bundled it with a lifetime of training I had used to develop my elemental cores, and jammed it inside an ever-growing ball of beast vitae. </p><p>“What’s going on? I thought the vitae was properly cleansed,” Astrid shouted, alerting me to their arrival. </p><p>“I don’t know. Just try to help him,” Lillian called, then gasped in pain. The reason became clear when I felt something dripping to my back, right on top of my heart. Her blood was used as a medium for her druidic spell. </p><p>It was the same trick she had used when my breakthrough had gone out of control. Once again, it worked, and the crystal lodged in my heart calmed down, stopping its wild mana output. But, it wasn’t enough to cheer, because the liquid beast vitae was still radiating its fury as it tried to grow further and further. </p><p>And, as it roared, I could feel my damaged elemental cores trembling and cracking even further as if their presence was being rejected. I channeled some mana without mental conception, trying to keep them together. </p><p>Astrid hit my body with a spell of her own, one that made me want to sleep. Yet, it also dampened the roars of the vitae. “Focus on my arm,” I told Astrid as I presented her with my bloody arm. </p><p>“What’s going on,” she asked even as her spell invaded my body again, dampening the roars even more. </p><p>“It’s complicated,” Lillian said, trying to deflect her questions. </p><p>“Tell her,” I growled, which was all I was able to say before I turned my attention to the vitae. Without the endless mana from the dragon heart, its growth had been halted, but it was still strong enough to affect me. </p><p>The foreign instincts hit me hard, but this time, they weren’t half-formed impressions. They were as strong as my own emotions, maybe even stronger. But, that way, they felt even more alien. I clamped on my own emotions, refusing to be swept by them while I did my best to influence them with my own thoughts, diluting their wildness. </p><p>“You can’t be serious. It’s impossible!” Astrid gasped once Lillian finished telling the most critical details of my situation. “No one could survive with elemental vitae and immaculate essence at the same time.” </p><p>“Really, that’s the part you’re surprised. Not the fact that he has a dragon heart lodged in his body constantly generating mana?” Lillian gasped. </p><p>“Talk that later,” I growled. “For now, find a way to help me.” </p><p>Not the nicest way of asking for help. In my defense, not only I was being tortured by the beast's vitae, but also my thoughts were repeatedly being invaded. It wasn’t exactly pleasant. </p><p>“Alright,” Astrid gasped, panicked. “I have an idea, one that we use to cleanse the essence of the beasts once it’s extracted. It’s not something that should be used on anything living, but…” </p><p>“Do it,” I said, ignoring the risks. Even with my best attempts, I could feel that the beast vitae was losing control. I didn’t want to risk it anymore. “Lillian, be ready to heal me if it goes badly.” </p><p>“Point me where the essence is gathered,” she said. I put my finger on my bloody arm, pointing to the exact location of that beast's core. Her spell was different than her previous ones. Dark, with jagged edges. As it sank into my arm, it hurt even worse than I expected. </p><p>But, despite that, I smiled. I could feel the consciousness of the beast vitae shatter under the spell, losing its coherency. I opened my eyes, and saw that my arm was even more mangled and damaged, maybe badly enough to require an amputation. </p><p>Still, better than losing myself to a beastly essence. I bit my lips even as I stretched my mana to beast essence once more, trying to take control. I wanted to take over before ejecting it. But, I was barely able to establish a rudimentary control over it before everything proved too much. </p><p>And, I collapsed. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“… Come on, genius. Is this all you can do,” one of the disciples shouted in glee as he kicked me again, while I stayed as a ball, my earlier attempts to ‘fight back’ had been easily deflected. Was being repeatedly kicked annoying, certainly, but I let it happen. </p><p>The reason was simple. The one that was kicking me was not actually an Everdawn student, but an expert of Tiger Fist who was just going through the motions. He could have easily hit hard enough to threaten my life if he wished. </p><p>I didn’t know if he was a measure against the spies, some kind of intentional hazing to increase the bonding of the recruits, or just an incentive to work harder, but the gaze of the disciples confirmed that I wasn’t the only one suffering the same thing. </p><p>Nor my bully was the only spy in the barracks. Still, despite the pain, I was glad to be beaten. It gave me an excuse to pull my tricks. </p><p>Only after my bully walked away, one of the other disciples walked toward me to help. “Don’t worry about it. We all experienced it. Just get strong, and show them.” </p><p>“Thanks,” I said as I followed him. “But, I don’t know if I can. They say that I’m talented, but I wasn’t even able to follow the master’s lesson. What if they kick me out,” I said, not going too much into detail. </p><p>“Don’t worry about it,” he said. “Once you reach Skin Refinement, they won’t dare to touch you.” With that, he led me to a small group. </p><p>“Can you help me,” I asked, still looking anxious. In a way, I was. While I had received a lesson on the basics of the Everdawn Fist, it was not enough for me to start comparing it to the Everdawn Saber. And, I couldn’t be sure that there were some intentional traps buried in the System. </p><p>“Sure,” he said. “This is the first stance…” With that, I received a lesson that lasted almost an hour, and I had some progress that I hoped to be believable. The lesson only stopped when I started showing signs of exhaustion, which was a sign of essence depletion. I used my medical talent to make my stomach growl. </p><p>There was no System reward. I hid a frown. It surprised me. I had been sure that the guy had been pitying me, particularly with my slow progress, and I had played in my bruised state quite well. </p><p>“Here, take some food. I swept it from the mess hall,” he said as he passed me an apple. It was mortal grade, but it was dense enough to carry some essence. </p><p>I grabbed it, not expecting anything.</p><p>[Pity Bonus - 10 (Capped)]</p><p>[10x Return - Apple, Mortal Peak-Grade]</p><p>That made me frown even harder. The System reward suggested that I hadn’t misread his pity. But, that left the question. Why there had been no reward from the System for the lesson. </p><p>A mystery that I needed to solve, so once I finished the apple, I made sure to get some lessons from the others. When it was finally time to sleep, I was looking at a list of new rewards. </p><p>[50x Return - Lute Lesson, Minor Familiarity, Major Accomplishment]</p><p>[50x Return - Tiger Fist Lesson, Major Immersion]</p><p>[10x Return - Bread, Mortal Peak-Grade]</p><p>…</p><p>[10x Return - Needle, Mortal Medium-Grade]</p><p>As I chatted with various disciples, I received a lot of small gifts as I managed to successfully trigger their pity many times — and on two occasions, managing to get insulted — but no matter how much I tried, there had been no reward of a martial technique.</p><p>Or, more accurately, there was no reward for Everdawn Fist. I did manage to trick one of the spies so they had given me a very brief lesson on Tiger Fist, and it triggered the reward. </p><p>As if that technique didn’t exist.</p><p>That realization was enough to tell me that I was in the right place. I didn’t exactly know what the System truly was, but something not triggering it was either extremely good news, or extremely bad news. Either way, it was not something to stay away from. </p><p>Then, there was the fact that the scale of the System Reward. No one that had been cultivating the Everdawn Fist triggered the cultivation reward for me … even the ones that were at Connate Realm. It had implications. </p><p>“Enough talking. Everyone to the beds. You have a huge day of training ahead of you. For the honor of Everdawn Nation!” </p><p>“For Everdawn Nation!” everyone responded loudly, showing indoctrination in the process. I lay down, faking sleep while processing everything I had learned. </p><p>The unresponsive System was clearly the biggest thing, but I ignored it for the moment. I didn’t know what the System was, meaning it wasn’t exactly actionable. </p><p>The lack of a Cultivation Bonus was something else. It was very important, and not because it cost me some replaceable rewards. No, it mattered, because it made me question whether it would work in reverse. Would I still receive rewards if I used Everdawn Arts to reach the Connate realm? </p><p>Tempting, but not tempting enough to make me experiment recklessly before I solved the mysteries of the essence. </p><p>So, I focused on what I learned about the Everdawn Essence. Its weakness was obvious, but with more samples, I determined with high certainty that it was entirely about the weakness of its spiritual pillar. Which, of course, had reinforced one of my earlier assumptions. That martial arts had some kind of interaction with the universe, one that I couldn’t detect. </p><p>Of course, with that realization, came a lot of unsolved questions.</p><p>When all those facts combined, solving the mystery of martial arts suddenly escalated several times. Potentially getting stronger without breaking the System was game-changing, enough to take the risk of sneaking around during the night. </p><p>Some exploration was in order. Luckily, there weren’t a lot of guards. Why should it be, when they had a giant formation to track the movement of everyone inside. </p><p>It wasn’t like a true master of formations would sneak and block its detection. My first destination was the library at the outer ring, where they kept the martial manuals. Stealing everything was tempting, but I had to limit myself to reading one of the copies. </p><p>There weren’t enough books for one of them to go missing safely. </p><p>I started reading. </p>",

    "content": "<p>My guide didn’t say a lot even as he led me inside the formation, allowing me to get a better view of the valley I had been led into. I noticed a secondary formation inside, which was clearly stronger than the outer formation. It was surrounded by some kind of light effect to prevent anyone from seeing inside, but the presence of multiple cultivators coming in and out was unmistakable. </p><p>Luckily, they were merely Qi Gathering cultivators, obvious even from a distance. As much as I was confident battling with Foundation Establishment cultivators, it needed to happen in an area under my control for it to happen without creating a bigger disaster than I was willing to deal with. </p><p>So, the fact that the base wasn’t teeming with Foundation Establishment cultivators worked well for me. </p><p>I turned my attention to the layout of the outer ring. It wasn’t as crowded as I expected. I could see about a thousand people, most of them training while a minority dealt with the logistic tasks. The numbers were not intimidating, even though a majority of them were in the Bone Forging realm — their incompetent movements suggesting they were raised mostly by pills. </p><p>However, I didn’t let that underestimate the operation. There were more than three hundred buildings, most still under construction with only two looked like in use. </p><p>Meaning, they were planning to increase the number somewhere above a hundred thousand. A dangerous number of martial artists even if they were weak Connate Realm artists raised by pills. And, the technique in mind told me that it wasn’t the limit those martial artists could reach. </p><p>No, whatever that was going on here, even if this was the only base, it wasn’t going to be pretty. </p><p>As my guide brought me toward one of the trainers, I watched the trainees, learning their arts. The first thing I took note, they weren’t learning the saber technique in my mind. Instead, it was a fist art. It still had Everdawn Empire as a totem, that much was obvious — well, obvious to my expert assessment, I doubt anyone else could catch it easily — but other than that, everything was different. </p><p>My guide brought me to a small tent. “Get down,” he said and moved away the moment I did so. </p><p>“Come in,” the voice called from the tent. I followed the order, and saw a middle-aged man sitting on a cushion.</p><p>“So, you’re the new recruit,” he spoke as he looked at me, assessing me like a butcher measuring a cow. </p><p>“Yes, master,” I replied as I stood in front of him, making sure to put enough respect and awe into my tone. After all, they were looking to raise a disposable army. I needed to convince them that I was a good peon. </p><p>“Give me your hand,” he said. I did so, and he checked my pulse. A basic apothecary technique, though thanks to supernatural abilities, even a mediocre apothecary gathered more information through it than an X-ray. Knowing what they were looking for, I hid any sign that I had practiced martial arts once again, glad that they didn’t send a cultivator for the test. </p><p>I had taken certain measures against that, but I prefer not to test them unless it was necessary. </p><p>I checked him in turn and saw that he was yet another Tiger Fist expert, Connate Realm. A pretty strong one if his essence was any indicator. “You have the talent,” he said, his eyes bright, but a frown followed. “How did you never learn martial arts.” </p><p>“No … no one would teach an orphan martial arts in my village, master,” I said. </p><p>“You should have found a way,” he replied, his disdain clear. I made a show of wilting. “Still, it doesn’t matter. You’re lucky that you’re learning under a true master. Follow me. I’ll train you myself. Your talent deserves nothing less.”</p><p>Interesting distinction, but I wasn’t surprised I got a private trainer. The effort they had put into my transformation had been enough. Now, I just needed a way to slow things down, one that wouldn’t be too suspicious. </p><p>I decided to undersell my comprehension. </p><p>It was a smart idea. After all, up until now, they were focused on my physical talent, which was mostly about the speed a body could adapt to essence, have breakthroughs, and convert food and pills into usable energy. </p><p>Comprehension was related to the speed one learned the techniques. It was a good way to delay things for two reasons. First, they clearly didn’t value my comprehension too much, or they would have tried to test it before using a cultivator to move me around. </p><p>Not to mention the fact that being stupid fitted well with my fake peasant background. If it could get a few insults or pitying looks in the process, even better. I just needed to make sure I didn’t overdo it to turn myself completely useless. </p><p>“Listen carefully. This technique is called Everdawn Fist, and it represents the freedom and strength of the people, one that represents not only your power, but the ability to protect everyone. It represents the promise of a nation, one where everyone would be free, and no one would go hungry.” </p><p>“I-is such a thing even possible,” I gasped, playing the gullible peasants. “The city lords—” </p><p>“Are nothing. Even the kings and immortals are nothing,” he said, and unfurled a picture, one that showed a drawing of the Empire’s sigil, a stylized sun above a mountain. “This is the Symbol of Everdawn, the crystallization of our hopes and dreams. The mountain represents the bones of our strength, and the sun shows our endless hopes.” </p><p>“With this, we’ll carve a path through the world, and show them that we mortals are not to be stopped…” </p><p>What followed was a long, boring lecture that lasted an hour and was delivered entirely in shouts, where I had to stand for the whole duration. The lecture could be summarized as Everdawn’s amazing superiority that would give me a lot of power and freedom, with absolutely no side effects, and any wound that I would receive would be entirely heroic, and fetching to the ladies. </p><p>It was mostly a mixture of military propaganda and religious sermons, which didn’t surprise me. He wanted to solidify the concept of Everdawn while fostering a sense of loyalty. A bit heavy-handed, but understandable considering he believed he was speaking to a gullible peasant. </p><p>“Do you accept the grace of Everdawn Nation?” he finally asked. </p><p>“Yes, master,” I said as I knelt.</p><p>“Good, then swear,” he said. As he said that, two martial artists walked into the tent, one on each side of me, and flared their essence as they put their hands on my shoulders. I tensed for a moment, especially since they were Connate Realm martial artists. However, they did nothing. </p><p>I realized it was just a way to familiarize me with the essence, crude, but effective. </p><p>I repeated the oath, which was once again pointlessly long. However, I was glad for the length this time, because it finally gave me a chance to examine the Everdawn Essence. </p><p>And, the results were … interesting. </p><p>The first thing I noticed was the weakness of the essence. It was showy and bright, but spiritually, it was very weak. It was nowhere as strong as the essence that even a first-time Tiger Fist user could gather, let alone compared to the intense energy of the Black Tiger onslaught. </p><p>The way they were, I sincerely doubted that they could even fight against an ordinary Skin Refinement martial artist. </p><p>It was not even as strong as the Forest essence I had first generated, before I discovered how to add conceptual weight to the martial art practice. Yet, its weakness wasn’t a surprise. After all, its reliance was an empire that currently did not exist. </p><p>That fact alone gave me a good idea about their plans. It was clear that their existence was more about creating and empowering the spiritual pillar than actually fighting. </p><p>Of course, that didn’t mean my mission was over. I still needed to get a better understanding of the exact process, particularly the role those sabotaged stone gates had been playing. </p><p>“Do you swear to always hold true to your oath,” he said. </p><p>“I do,” I promised, not particularly caring about a false oath, particularly since the oath itself was to a nonsense. I might have been more careful if the oath actually mentioned Everdawn Empire directly — there was something funky about oaths in this world — but swearing to a false entity, based on false principles, was not a threat. </p><p>“Good. Now, stand up, disciple of Everdawn, and fight for our nation!” he declared. “Now, let’s teach you our martial art,” he said, which started a three-hour torture … for him, as I played the slow and stupid student to the limit, making sure he was frustrated, but not hopeless. </p><p>It wasn’t as hard as I feared, my seemingly absolute lack of education making things very easy. Too bad it didn’t trigger the System, as I would have loved a System-boosted lesson, but it couldn’t be helped. </p><p>Then, he finally surrendered, and a guard. “Bring him to the barracks. Tomorrow, he can join the training with the rest. And, assign someone to teach him how to read.” </p><p>The guard saluted before leaving, and I followed. </p><p> It was time to see if I could get some rewards from my fellow disciples. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Once I built the formation to protect myself, I stepped onto the boat, acting like I was in shock. “Sit down, and don’t say anything,” the cultivator ordered, clearly frustrated at what he saw as an errant. Not that I blamed him. </p><p>He said nothing as he used his Qi to check me, though he was far more haphazard than the apothecary. He was a cultivator from one of the minor families, probably from their main branch for him to possess a small flying boat, though it was not in top shape. </p><p>There was on problem. His involvement was enough to confirm that I had overdone my talent a bit. After all, while my grand formation couldn’t catch every message talisman, it could certainly catch the presence of random cultivators. </p><p>A small flying boat, I would have noticed. Meaning, it was the first time they were sending a boat like that to my territory. Still, I didn’t consider that as a mistake. Unless the base had multiple Golden Core cultivators, I was confident of escaping even if my subterfuge had been discovered. </p><p>Not to mention, it helped me to bypass several conditions. If I had tried to observe them from the camp, it would have taken weeks to track them back to the base, which was clearly nowhere near our borders. However, the more we traveled, the more I started to suspect whether the base would be actually misty mountains, which would be a surprise. </p><p>That mist was famous for suppressing martial essence. An interesting choice, which triggered a lot of questions for me. Unfortunately, as the mist appeared on the horizon, I also noticed a large concealment formation at a distance, hiding a valley from the cultivators and martial artists alike — which, ironically, made it even more noticeable in the eyes of a master like me. </p><p>Too bad, I thought. There were some interesting implications if they were actually picked misty mountains to train us. But, now, it seemed they wanted to use the wilderness to their benefit. After all, the outskirts covered a great expanse, and only around various points the cultivators explored. </p><p>As for my unwilling companion, he was ruffling through a book while occasionally murmuring owing favors, and the cost of alchemy. I could also see several harvested spirit plants, suggesting he might actually be an alchemist. Combined with his attitude, making clear that he wasn’t a part of the conspiracy, I decided to take a different risk since we were near our destination. </p><p>After all, since he wasn’t able to hurt me due to needing to deliver me to my destination, I could push my luck a bit. He wouldn’t attack me, and even if he did, I could handle him with an illusion formation if needed. </p><p> “Great cultivator,” I dared to speak, interrupting his reading. </p><p>He looked at me angrily. “What!” he said, but there was no blast of Qi to punish me. Pity, I wouldn’t say no to extra Qi. I made a show of falling to my knees, tears in my eyes.  </p><p>“I … I hoped you could enlighten me about alchemy,” I said, babbling in shock. “I have a talent for picking herbs. I thought maybe I have a talent for alchemy as well.” </p><p>“Weren’t you a martial artist? You dare to think about alchemy!” he gasped. </p><p>I leaned into my ignorant villager role. “Is there a difference?” I asked. </p><p>“A difference! A difference!” he gasped, shocked. I could see that he was growing angrier. He reached for his dagger, but rather than pulling it out, he chose to give me a rant about the noble art of alchemy, and how it could never be touched by a mere martial artist. </p><p>With some specific examples, triggering the System. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 20; Insult Bonus - 120 (Capped)]</p><p>[140x Return - Umnim Alchemy Technique - Beginner, Minor Familiarity]</p><p>“… Now, get out,” he growled when we arrived at our destination, throwing me out after a lengthy tirade. Too bad he didn’t choose to attack me indirectly as my Foundation Establishment prisoner did, or I could have easily bypassed Perfection. </p><p>I activated the skill as the boat flew away, while I made a show of looking around. </p><p>Still, even Minor Familiarity was exceedingly useful. At least, it gave me some foundational knowledge about how to refine, identify, and process the pills. I didn’t have any recipes, but that part was even easier to handle now that I could actually visit the cultivator market. </p><p>Once I landed, another martial artist, dressed in black appeared, riding a horse while dragging another one. “A-are you here to bring me to my master?” I asked. </p><p>“Yes, junior,” the guard said. “Come with me, and I’ll bring you to the master.” </p><p>I tried to mount, only to fall. I made a show of shame. “I … I don’t know how to ride a horse, great martial master,” I gasped. He frowned, but he still rode next to me and pulled me to his back. “Alright, then hold tight.” </p><p>My acting was to partially reinforce my role. Since my talent was more outrageous than they expected, I needed to drive my lack of knowledge even further to be convincing. </p><p>As I held onto him, I checked both his status and the status of the horse. The horse alone was significant, marking it as a savage beast that could fight against an ordinary Skin Refinement martial artist. His cultivation was more surprising. He was still a martial artist, one of Bone Forging, but this time, I finally met a Tiger Fist disciple. </p><p>Finally, I was near to the center of the operation. </p><p>Once that was determined, I spent my time processing my newly acquired alchemy technique, just not to the point of missing the presence of almost a hundred hidden sentries on the way. Even in the middle of the wilderness, they were taking their security very seriously. </p><p>The sentries I had seen alone could have invaded the Kingdom of Zaim with ease before my arrival. </p><p>The alchemy technique was more interesting. While having merely Minor Familiarity felt underwhelming, considering I had made more progress than someone else might have struggled to make in a decade without exceptional talent, I couldn’t exactly complain. </p><p>Minor Familiarity had been enough to create some serviceable talismans, and that was surely true for alchemy as well. Now, Especially since I could afford to waste both my Qi and spirit plants while refining. I doubted many alchemists had that luxury, considering even the material for the cheapest pill would be measured in spirit stones. </p><p>Now, all I needed was some recipes, and I could start working on increasing my available resources. </p><p>Only when we finally approached the area covered under the formation, did I put my full attention to the formation. After all, not only I could feel that its strength was significant, but it wasn’t based on a disk. Meaning, an expert had set. </p><p>Luckily, it looked like, once again, it was built by a Foundation Establishment cultivator. However, the owner was clearly better than the one who sabotaged the stone gate, once again forcing me to update the threat level of the conspiracy. </p><p>Formation experts were supposed to be valuable, and they could order multiple experts around. </p><p>The formation had three functions. Concealment, detection, and killing. The first function made sure to suppress the disturbance of essence and Qi underneath, while the detection not only detected the people entering, but also the movement inside. </p><p>Together, it was a devastating combination enough, but there was a connected killing formation that could be activated if the controller desired. However, it didn’t seem to be automatic. </p><p>Still, it was a dangerous outlook, wondering whether turning back was the better choice. I had already found their base, and I could escape before sneaking in my own time. It would be safer … but riskier. Not for me, but for the people of the mortal kingdoms. I didn’t know their exact plan and their timeline, but I was sure that whatever plan they had would cause bloodshed that was hard to imagine. </p><p>Especially since this world was huge. Billions of people lived in mortal kingdoms, a shocking number considering it wasn’t the only mortal domain even in our continent. </p><p>Delaying my entrance could mean a disaster. Worse, considering all the measures they used to keep my arrival discreet and safe, even going as far as using an unrelated cultivator to further conceal, my sudden disappearance could spook them to trigger their plans easily. </p><p>I obediently kept the peace, cursing my newly developed sense of responsibility. No, retreating out of this mess was not an option, not with the potential cost in place. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“She’s an enthusiastic one, isn’t she,” I said as Carol sat next to me while listening Amy’s deep moans, not mentioning just how Carol’s presence intensified her reaction more. </p><p>“Well, she enjoys fun … though it has been a while she brought in one of her one-night stands,” Carol said absentmindedly. Amy didn’t answer, partly because she was not in a state to do so, but I doubted she would have done so even without it. </p><p>After all, it would require her talking about her crush, and she was clearly terrified of emotional vulnerability. </p><p>I continued to push inside her, enjoying the way she wrapped around me, her already impressive tightness turning phenomenal at Carol’s presence. “Well, it makes what we’re doing a public service, then. Why don’t you help me make it memorable.” </p><p>Even the suggestion was enough to make Amy shiver helplessly. I let her down, allowing her to bury her face to the pillow. “I don’t know. Isn’t a bit much.” </p><p>“Don’t you think it’s rude to keep your hands away from her during a threesome,” I asked, willing to goad her. A proper threesome would be much more fun … and also, it was a good idea to keep Amy happy. </p><p>After all, she was going to work for me for a long time. </p><p>“Well, it’s even ruder to ignore her. Don’t you think so, Amy?” I asked, forcing her to contribute and admit that. It wasn’t exactly a declaration of love, which she was clearly incapable, but it was a start. </p><p>“Yes, it’s — rude,” Amy moaned, unable to contain the cry of pleasure that interrupted her, overwhelmed by the possibility. </p><p>“R-really,” Carol murmured, her sudden blush, particularly considering the circumstances, was intense enough to suggest more self-consciousness that was warranted, implying that it was her first threesome. </p><p>Interesting, and not just because she had been a very rich girl, a demographic that was famous for endless partying. The speed she had responded to Amy’s challenge and the way she ‘fought’ against Nicole made me feel like she was at least familiar with it. </p><p>But now, I could see that she was being driven by her inherent competitiveness and anger even more than I had first realized. </p><p>Fun. </p><p>Just, not as immediately fun as Amy’s cries when Carol leaned forward and pressed her lips against Amy’s neck. I continued pumping into her, enjoying her howling and shrieking as she tightened even more. I fucked her relentlessly, her delirious moans encouraging Carol to be more adventurous, her hands exploring Amy’s breasts gently. </p><p>She had already done more than a few caresses, but they were under my direct command while she was lost in her pleasure, which made quite a bit difference. She slowly explored Amy’s body while Amy just moaned, and I continued to impale her from behind. </p><p>“I’m sure she has been an annoying roommate at times,” I suddenly said to Carol, who looked at me askance, trying to understand why I interrupted her fun with such a random comment. “Enough to deserve a few spanks, even,” I added, soft enough that Amy wouldn’t hear due to her own moans, allowing Carol to read my lips. </p><p>“I don’t know,” she whispered back. “Isn’t it … too much?” </p><p>I didn’t even bother to answer, just nodded toward her hands, tied beautifully, and chuckled. Carol caught the implication. “Y-you’re right,” she answered, much louder. “She had been a terrible roommate. She doesn’t clean. She’s careless with her leftovers. She leaves the door open…” she counted, and Amy stiffened, not understanding the sudden shift. Though, it was hard to blame her. It must be hard to think under the circumstances. </p><p>“How rude,” I agreed theatrically. “What do you plan to do?” </p><p>“She deserves a punishment,” Carol responded even as she raised her hand, and landed it on Amy’s ass, the smack echoing in the room. Amy was already near her climax, and it was enough to trigger her climax. She started trembling, and Carol looked at me questioningly. </p><p>I nodded, signaling her to continue. Now that Amy was finally getting what she wanted, there was no harm making it even more memorable. Carol spanked her again, and I continued to push inside her, determined to pleasure her like no other man ever did. </p><p>Admittedly, I was cheating a bit … but if you weren’t cheating, you weren’t trying. </p><p>“You’re such a messy roommate, Amy,” Carol muttered as she spanked her once again. “Are you sorry about leaving all the messes?” </p><p>With her face buried on the pillow, Amy was unable to answer. Since I was a gentleman, as always, I decided to help. I grabbed her arms — still bound with my belt behind her back — and pulled. Carol took the clue and grabbed her bright pink hair to pull her head back as well. “Yes!” Amy moaned as Carol spanked her again. Carol smiled, happy with the response. </p><p>“And, do you promise to be more careful around the house?” she asked even as she spanked her again. </p><p>“Are — are you going to spank me again if I don’t?” Amy asked. </p><p>“Yes,” Carol declared, spanking her again, even harder as she started to get into the mood. </p><p>“Then, I won’t,” Amy answered, somehow managing to sound playful and cheeky despite the pleasure she was suffering under. </p><p>“You bitch,” Carol chuckled as she reached to Amy’s dangling, spectacular tits, and twisted her nipples aggressively. “I’ll make you sorry.” </p><p>“You’ll try,” Amy declared, far too happy by goading Carol to actually care. Amy clearly enjoyed Carol’s rough treatment, more than I suspected that she would enjoy if I pushed that much. </p><p>Love conquered all, even the misguided, cowardly kind Amy clearly felt. </p><p>I couldn’t help but chuckle as I watched them interact despite the aggressive drilling Amy was suffering, rough yet playful at the same time. Ironically, despite the little interaction, I could see that they would have made a good couple if it wasn’t for two things. </p><p>Carol clearly wasn’t ready to commit to a relationship, too obsessed with success and regaining what she lost, and Amy had a warped sense of self and would never believe she deserved a happy relationship, and subconsciously, she would do her best to sabotage any relationship. </p><p>It was amusing just how much I was able to decipher about their personality, but it was the quirk of sex. People revealed a lot about their true selves, with a kind of honest expression that a therapist would require months to coax out even out of a willing patient. </p><p>They were lucky that I was one of the good guys … well, given a value of goodness. I could have easily used what I observe from the situation to shatter and destroy them … but instead, I was actually considering playing the matchmaker. </p><p>Well, the fun way, of course. Neither girl acted like they particularly minded a fun threesome, giving me several fun ways to help them explore their emotions. </p><p>Once Amy climaxed once again, I pulled out, letting her catch her breath. Even a strong punk beauty like her needed her rest. I even reached and unwrapped her hands, letting her move. She flipped and lay on her back, breathing deeply, satiated. </p><p>I had no doubt that, if it wasn’t for Carol’s presence, it was the point Amy kicked me out and never called me again. </p><p>“Huh, I expected her to last longer …” Carol murmured, no doubt comparing it with the occasional one-night stands Amy enjoyed. </p><p>“Probably the long break you mentioned,” I said, giving Amy an excuse as she was clearly too dazed to speak. I didn’t want to explain how she was drained by the emotional roller-coaster she had been experiencing since my arrival. Carol didn’t look too convinced, so I decided to distract her. “Why don’t you clean the mess your precious roommate made,” I said as I grabbed her hair and pulled her down.</p><p>Her lips opened, and my shaft, still slippery with Amy’s climax, went into her mouth, preventing any follow up questions and distracting her appropriately. </p><p>And, since we were still on top of Amy, she did get an excellent view. She was lucky that Carol was too distracted to look her face, because, at this moment, her expression was an open book, showing all the emotions she had been enjoying at the same time. </p><p>Jealousy, arousal, desire, regret … truly a beautiful bundle of fun. </p><p>Carol, on the other hand, kept her eyes closed as she took my shaft deep into her throat, pushing herself deeper than I expected … far more than it could be about just pure pleasure. It was her competitiveness once again. </p><p>And, while I was nice enough to help them get together, I wasn’t nice enough to enjoy her unhealthy sense of competitiveness fully. I grabbed her head, pulling her forward as I enjoyed her aggressive deep-throat without restriction until I exploded into her throat, but pulled back halfway to cover her face ass well. </p><p>Desperately breathing to recover, she made an excellent sight as she collapsed next to Amy, who immediately hugged her. She might be too cowardly to tell Carol how she truly felt, but she was clearly not too cowardly to use the warped circumstances for a comfortable cuddle.  </p><p>I decided that it was enough for the day … especially since I still had another meeting for the night. </p><p>“I’ll see you both at work tomorrow, at nine. Don’t be late, or there’ll be punishment,” I said as I walked away. </p><p>Wondering if I actually incentivized them to arrive late. Well, I would learn that tomorrow morning. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Decision made, I ignored the shouts outside as I focused on examining the forge. A forge that was far more expensive than I had ever worked with. </p><p>The first thing that caught my attention was the fire at the center, spilling out of the central forge. I walked closer, its heat washing over me intensely even at a distance, far more intense than I was working with. Still, I walked to the edge, letting the heat wash over me. </p><p>[-1 Health]</p><p>It was too intense for me to resist all day. At least, not without adding a few more levels first. </p><p>Still, I stayed at the center, watching the gold flickers dancing in the fire, trying to understand the reason for the intensity. Only to realize that the fire was eating the fuel at a shocking speed. Likely, it was some kind of enchantment to enable a higher heat. </p><p>It was fascinating to attain such a high degree of heat in an open fire. I took a step back even as I started examining the forge. It was both plain and flawless, which marked it as another product of the System store. I didn’t even want to imagine how much it would cost. </p><p>I turned my attention to the anvils and the other tools, using the Analyze to get a better sense of their enchantment. I couldn’t identify them without working on a lot of similar samples, but the sheer number of enchantments was enough to prove their quality. </p><p>“Troublesome,” I muttered even as I continued to check the room. They had spent a serious amount of capital on the forge, the kind that I hadn’t ever seen. No wonder Rosie was willing to make a big deal with them. </p><p>It was a tumultuous situation, the kind that was a wrong move that could cost me my life. The prudent thing would be to keep my head down and get away… but then what. What did prudence have given me other than being discarded and ignored? </p><p>I could probably keep my head down until the operation ended up in failure, but I would find myself in the same situation. With each passing day, the value of my class was getting lower and lower. Yes, a political battle within one of the upstart new so-called noble houses was dangerous, the kind that could end up in my death. </p><p>But, that was a valid concern for every expedition. </p><p>The rewards, however … </p><p>“No risk it, no biscuit,” I muttered even as I grabbed one of the unused hammers, far better than my own poor tool that doubled as a weapon. As I twirled it in my hand, I moved to the side, where a shockingly large pile of damaged weapons lay. The pile had hundreds of weapons, while a connected room held even more. </p><p>However, as I hovered above the pile, a sour smell hit my nose, coming from some of the weapons that hadn’t been cleaned properly. I ignored it momentarily as I picked one of the clean weapons. </p><p>It was some kind of short sword that was reminiscent of a gladius, but thicker. I pulled one from the pile, closing my eyes as I focused my [Analyze] ability, examining its inner structure. </p><p>Even without Eleanor’s earlier explanation, I could understand the reason for it. While it had some structural cracks that limited the impact of the Sharpness enchantment, it was nowhere near enough to turn the weapons useless. </p><p>No, that honor went to the edge, worn out as if it was dipped into a vat of acid. Though, curious, I touched one of the unclean ones, wondering why they kept it that tainted. But, I saw that the unclean ones weren’t more damaged than the clean ones. </p><p>The impact wasn’t as simple as the blood being acidic, but I shrugged. Each monster had its own unique problems, and while I would have enjoyed pondering about it, I was mature enough to admit that it was more of an intellectual curiosity than a practical concern. </p><p>I didn’t need to care about the political crisis that was going on, or the way those monsters degraded the sharp edges of the weapons. I just needed to focus on my job. </p><p>For the moment, I needed to start repairing. I walked back to the forge, letting the heat wash over the magical metal. I closed my eyes, using [Analyze] to keep track of the heating process. I ignored the heat brushing against my skin, and let System do its thing. </p><p>[-1 Health]</p><p>“Fascinating,” I muttered as I watched the process of the metal reaching the ideal temperature for reforging. In my old forge, it would have required twenty minutes for the edges to heat up enough without destabilizing the enchantment. </p><p>It would have been easier with the [Warm Blow], but lack of it wasn’t a bother. It was all about the timing. I pulled out the weapon, ignoring my skill’s instinctual suggestion to keep it in the flames longer, knowing that it would warp and weaken the enchantment. </p><p>I used my hammer instead of one of the better tools lying around. Not because of a sense of nostalgia, but to avoid introducing too many variables. With a practiced ease, I started hammering the edge, careful not to distort the enchantment even as I destroyed the edge completely, using some ext. </p><p>If the damage to the edge was lesser, some sharpening would have been enough, but not with this. I ignored the next step my skill was suggesting, which was to add more metal to bring the weapon to its ideal weight. It would help, but it would also increase the work time almost ten times. </p><p>Especially without [Warm Blow] to keep it going, forcing me to continuously heat up the metal to keep it searing and soft without turning molten.</p><p>Ordinarily, I could never get away with such a shortcut, even though it would make absolutely no difference. The moment even a new Blacksmith touched it, their [Repair] skill would trigger to inform that it was not correctly repaired, and I would have a reputation for shoddy work. </p><p>No one really cared about acceptable performance degradation. </p><p>I was hoping that my new employees would have a more open mind. They were dealing with a monster that destroyed multiple weapons a day. A faster repair should have been a more than acceptable tradeoff. </p><p>Assuming, of course, their operation continued, but that was a different problem. </p><p>I let my skill guide me as I delivered blow after blow, achieving a smoothness that I could never achieve in its absence. I might not want to follow its suggestions religiously, but that didn’t mean it was useless. </p><p>Especially since it was hard to truly use the Stats productively without the assistance of the skills. </p><p>I started humming even as my hammer landed again and again, reshaping the distorted metal that had been degraded by the acid, only stopping to heat the metal. </p><p>Forty-five minutes later, I moved away from the grinding stone, having just developed a new edge. I ignored the niggling of my skill that constantly niggled at the back of my mind, repeating that it was not completely fixed. It was like leaving the house without turning off the oven. A constant niggling.</p><p>Unpleasant, but considering I was able to finish the work in fifteen minutes when the contract required me to merely six weapons a day to start earning bonuses, more than acceptable. The clean whistle of the sword was only possible with a working Sharpening enchantment. Who cared what the [Repair] skill said. </p><p>I just needed to convince my new employers of that fact. </p><p>Taking a break was tempting, especially since the heat had been punishing. Even using Health to recover, it left my skin raw and tingling. It was not pleasant. However, I didn’t have the luxury of </p><p>Without taking a break, I grabbed a new weapon. It was time for another experiment, to see how much improvement the new tools would bring. </p><p>Once again, the benefits of the Repair reduced the adaptation period significantly. The first attempt took slightly more than half an hour. The second one shaved a few extra minutes. By the sixth, I was able to maintain a steady pace to bang down one at the twenty-minute mark, and that was with several breaks I used to check the new process. </p><p>Without them, a steady pace of fifteen minutes was doable. </p><p>I decided to impress my employers. I started repairing one after another, the metal gleaming with a healthy sheen under my consistent blows. It was fun, steady work — one that would have been much better without the constant niggling sensation at the back of my head. </p><p>It was already noon when I had a visitor. Eleanor was back, with an exhausted expression on her face. An expression that shifted to wonder and shock the moment she noticed the number of weapons that were waiting for her. “What’s going on?” she asked, tense.</p><p>“I’m working hard to earn my bonus, of course,” I said, trying to add some levity to the situation. It didn’t work. “Since someone just took away all the experts, I decided to see if I can find a way to go faster,” I explained. </p><p>“How. I thought you only have Repair.” </p><p>“Well, yes,” I said. “Before I explain, check the weapons first and see if they are properly fixed,” I said. I didn’t want to explain what I did before she checked the results directly, not wanting to prejudice her. It was a very critical part of any experiment that required subjective assessment. </p><p>She frowned as she tested the weapons one by one, with a slight frown on her face as she assessed them. Yet, the clean whistle of the sword was unmistakable. “It feels alright,” she admitted. “Now, explain.” </p><p>“I used some shortcuts that don’t exactly follow the Skill completely, so, technically, they are not completely repaired.” She said nothing, but her expression shifted from affable and confused to sharp. It would have scared me, but against Thomas, she had been much scarier. </p><p>I gave her a detailed summary of the process, which mollified her somewhat, but she also looked confused. “Looks promising,” she said even as she took five swords. “Follow me, we’re going to explain it to Lady Maria.” </p><p>I followed her with a sigh. I hoped that the redhead wouldn’t be too frustrating. </p>",

    "content": "<p>We arrived at the camp at dawn. As much as I hated the necessity to keep my eyes open more than necessary, I forced myself, trying to catch the important details. It was smaller than I expected. A wooden palisade around about twenty wooden buildings, surrounded by double the amount of tents. Also, there was quite a bit of empty space. </p><p>The number of guards I could see on the wall was less than I expected. I could only count a dozen on each wall, each armed with bows, but the safety of the camp suggested that they were stronger than our town guards. </p><p>Even from such a great distance, the quality of their armor was apparent, and each was marked with a stylized griffin. I hoped that it was a guild, and not one of the new houses that was popping out, quick to declare themselves as nobles. </p><p>Three years after the Cataclysm, and the political situation was still in flux. </p><p>The rest of the camp was barely stirring into movement. A quick estimation suggested that there were about three hundred people currently in the camp, including the guard. Less than I expected considering the size of the camp. I assumed that they were at the dungeon. </p><p>That was all I was able to assess until the vertigo hit, forcing me to close my eyes once more. I fought against monsters many times, but still, the heights were my greatest enemy. </p><p>“Finally, we’re here,” Maria called loudly as we landed, stretching her legs. Eleanor helped me to step down. I appreciated her help. I doubted that I would have been able to do so without help. “Hey, are you alright?” Maria asked, noticing my state. </p><p>“Just a cramp. It’s my first time riding a griffin,” I replied, doing my best to be calm and collected. I failed. Luckily, Maria didn’t care about me to care about why I was reacting like that. “Eleanor, let’s go. Father expects a report.” </p><p>“Just a minute. Let me show Devon his workshop first,” she said. Maria didn’t look happy. “The sooner he settles, the sooner he starts working. We need sharpened weapons to move deeper. We’re running low,” she said. </p><p>“Alright, but don’t waste too much time. We still need to lead the team to the dungeon,” she said before moving to the central building. </p><p>While Eleanor led me toward another building, I looked around, trying to catch the movements. “Anything I need to know,” I asked. “We haven’t been able to talk a lot.” </p><p>“There’s nothing too exciting,” she said. “It’s a lower-tier dungeon, populated with some kind of giant beetle with thick armor. The fire magic would have been a good way to deal with them, but the mana density prevents it from being a sustainable solution. But, they have several weak spots. Sharpened methods are the most efficient method of taking them down.” </p><p>“Ah,” I said. Suddenly, I understood the reason for the good contract. Sharpened weapons were cheap — compared to other enchanted weapons, still starting somewhere around fifty silver at a minimum for second-hand ones — and useful, but their durability was their biggest problem. “Their shell degrades the weapon even more, right,” I asked. </p><p>“Worse. They have some kind of secretion that ruins the edge,” she replied. “Even with multiple weapons assigned to each person, it goes slowly. And, we can’t keep going to the nearest town to repair.” </p><p>Understandable, as even with a flying mount, travel wasn’t exactly easy. We didn’t struggle against monsters because Maria was strong enough to deal with them easily. However, it wasn’t exactly smart to assign the top combatant to logistic work. </p><p>Especially there was a limit for the carrying capacity of the griffins. </p><p>“I see,” I replied, considering the implication. The fact that the edge was the part that was being damaged was good news. It was far easier to sharpen a new edge than repair structural damage, which meant that I would be making even more on bonuses than I had initially expected. “How about my work. The contract outlines my job requirements, but nothing else.” </p><p>“You’re going to join our team of blacksmiths. We currently have six capable of repairing enchanted weapons, each with both Analyze and Warm Blow. Seven with your inclusion. There’s also a dozen other apprentices that are working hard to raise their Repair over twenty-five with some disposable weapon so they could join the main work.” </p><p>I frowned, wondering whether I should mention that I didn’t have [Warm Blow] yet, which was a perk that allowed the blacksmiths to repair the enchanted weapons without heating it too much, as it had the risk of destabilizing the enchantment. Then, I decided against it. </p><p>There was no mention of it in the contract, and could the repair in any case. No need to give them useless information that could change their mind. People had weird expectations when it came to Stats and Skills, seemingly determined to ignore that we were not robots, and could easily surpass the limits. </p><p>The lack of Warm Blow didn’t mean I couldn’t keep up with the others. It would be some help, but even without it, I could keep up with the performance requirements outlined in the contract easily. All the tricks I figured out during the three years I spent working overtime were enough. All I needed was to be careful about the heat. </p><p>I didn’t rely entirely on the instincts fed to me by the skills. </p><p>In the end, I decided to stay silent. In the worst case, I could focus on bringing my Repair Skill to the next level. It should take only a few days as long as I was willing to ruin some weapons. </p><p>Eleanor continued to talk, giving me a quick tour of the camp while I watched. “And, this is the forge, where you’ll be working —” she started, only to freeze. </p><p>I assumed the reason was the tall, armored man at the center of the room. He was decked in full plate armor. On his chest, there was the symbol of a griffin like the guards, but it was far more intricate. All of it identified as a high-ranking member of the same group, but another thing commanded my attention. One that was radiating an aura that demanded respect and adulation. </p><p>Charisma. </p><p>I cursed internally. Of all the stats that were brought by the System, I hated Charisma the worst. On the battlefield, it worked wonders, allowing people to fight with a greater focus and coordinate better. In social life, it was disgusting. It was like an airborne drug. </p><p>Luckily, it was a pretty rare stat, and none of them deigned to live in a small town, making sure I never had to deal with them. </p><p>Even without my own prejudices relating to their existence, I could sense that he was bad news from Eleanor’s reaction. Up until now, she had given me the impression of a kind, affable woman despite her very obvious power. </p><p>The moment she saw him, her attitude changed, radiating a dark, dangerous feeling. It was like I was standing next to a giant sword, ready to spill blood. “Sir Thomas, how can this servant help you?” she said, but I had heard people less frustrated being thrown into the garbage. She didn’t bother hiding her hatred. </p><p>“Is this the way a retainer should act, Eleanor? Why are you on your knees?” he said, his smile mocking. His Charisma turned even more pointed, focusing on Eleanor. Her legs trembled, but she resisted it. </p><p>I took a step back, not willing to be affected. I hated the impact of Charisma, especially since the level difference made it very difficult to resist. </p><p>“As the sworn sword of Lady Maria, it’s not appropriate, my lord,” she replied. </p><p>Thomas smiled. “How fun,” he said. “I wonder how long you’ll be able to resist until you beg for me to save you from your grievous mistake.”</p><p>“This humble servant doesn’t deserve your concerns, my lord,” she replied. As I watched them absentmindedly, I couldn’t help but be fascinated by the way culture had changed in merely three years. Centuries of traditions relating to democracy and equality had been abandoned, replaced by a mockery of tribal politics, often with a cursory veneer of medieval nobility. </p><p>I never understood how such a drift could happen in less than a year, which was another reason I had been so enthusiastic about joining the rare research institutes that were finally popping around — only to fail. </p><p>Thomas smirked, no doubt about to follow up with another subtle insult, but his expression changed when Eleanor grabbed her sword. “Don’t worry, Eleanor. We’re old friends. I’m just worried about my dear cousin, and wanted to see if I can help any.” </p><p>“She’s busy, and she doesn’t want to see you,” Eleanor replied. “But, feel free to visit and see if she changes her mind.” </p><p>“Oh, what a pity,” he said, his smugness back. “I’ll just deal with my mission and leave, then,” he said. </p><p>“Your mission,” Eleanor asked. </p><p>“Yes. The family council honored me with an emergency mission of protecting one of the trade routes. And, I’m here to get the necessary resources.” </p><p>Eleanor froze as he passed her a sealed envelope. “No. That’s against the deal. We have been promised no interference.” </p><p>“From our side of the family, and we fulfilled it. We can’t help if the family council assigned me with a critical mission that’s more important than a mere dungeon subjugation.” He smirked as he looked at the blacksmith. “Anyone employed directly by the family, follow me. You have your orders,” he said. </p><p>I watched from the side as the majority of the employees had left the room, leaving only five behind. </p><p>Eleanor followed them, panicked, and the rest of the blacksmiths followed her, no doubt wanting to leave. </p><p>I considered following them but decided against it. I had no idea what would happen, but there were two options. Either the operation was dead, or it would continue. If it continued, getting familiar with the workshop and the weapons would be useful. </p><p>And, if the operation was dead, I better repair a few weapons. Maybe I could push the repair to the next rank before they kick me out. </p><p>After all, even if they failed, the dungeon wouldn’t disappear. Another team would establish a new camp, where I could work. </p><p>Either way, it was better than watching a pointless competition between a bunch of rich kids to finalize. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Once my deal with Rosie was done, I didn’t even wait for her confirmation before visiting the workshop to resign and empty my apartment. </p><p>One underrated benefit of Strength, it made moving much easier. No need to call friends and arrange for pizza and beer. And, once I brought things to the storage room Rosie provided at the basement of Broken Tankard, I spent the rest of my time rearranging my books, wondering if I should bring any. </p><p>Ultimately, I decided to pick some scientific journals that were about mechanical engineering and metallurgy, which I had purchased when I had been making good money. They hadn’t been as useful as I had hoped, partially because I lacked the basics. While having one of my bachelor's degrees in Math helped me to understand the gist of the topic easily, ultimately, I wasn’t familiar with the basics of engineering enough to make a difference. </p><p>Though, to be fair, I didn’t really push myself. Back then, I was still confident that my career as a Blacksmith was temporary, a blip before I once again started working as a researcher. </p><p>Now that I was facing another opportunity to make serious money as a blacksmith, I didn’t want to miss my chance. The dungeon without mana was a good opportunity to make some serious cash regardless of what it would produce. </p><p>This time, I planned to make some serious money before the opportunity was gone. </p><p>Naturally, the dungeon would stay there for a long time, but sooner or later, other blacksmiths would join the fray. Perk Reset stone was not unique to me, and it wasn’t my genius that gave me the ability to repair enchanted weapons. It was easy to figure out as long as someone was willing to spend some money. </p><p>The number of blacksmiths capable of it would increase, and as a consequence, the money we could make would go down. Simple supply and demand. </p><p>Once I picked the books I would bring along, I went upstairs to her office. I knocked, and she invited me. </p><p>She wasn’t alone. Two other people were sitting on the other side of her desk, both female. One of them was a redhead, and wore a robe while the other was a blonde and was dressed in a thick chainmail. Their outfits radiated the distinct aura of an enchantment. It was subtle, but working with enchanted weapons for years gave me a good sense of their potential.</p><p>Neither enchantment was weak, but the robe was much stronger than the armor. </p><p>The one with the robe spoke first. “So, you’re the reason we have to take the long road. Merely Level 7, how disappointing,” she commented, which earned a glance from her armored friend … bodyguard. Not for nothing. Using skills like that was considered as rude as just going through someone else’s phone pre-Cataclysm. </p><p>“I presume so. Assuming, of course, the deal is complete,” I answered, not reacting to her rude and obvious attempt to establish control. She was clearly unaware of how much information she had revealed by declaring that. Not only she was rich — identification skills were strategic resources, therefore very expensive — but also she was coddled. The entitled declaration was not just rude, but also it revealed a pretty important secret of her own. </p><p>She reminded me of one of my more entitled students. </p><p>From her wince, I could see that the blonde understood exactly what her companion did but said nothing. It made it more likely that she was a bodyguard rather than a friend. </p><p>“Mostly. You just need to check the details,” Rosie said as she pushed a piece of paper toward me. I read, doing my best to keep my expression neutral, but I wasn’t sure that I succeeded. The deal was good. Too good. </p><p>“I hope that he’s as good as you promised,” the redhead spoke. “If not, I might change my mind about the rest of your promises.” </p><p>“Don’t worry. Ten more blacksmiths that fulfill the conditions, and a hundred warriors, in two weeks. I keep my promises.” </p><p>That explained the generosity of the deal even more. Rosie was using me as some kind of proof of concept. It actually made me feel better about the extremely generous deal. </p><p>Not only I would receive two silver every hour while I was at the repair station regardless of the work, with bonuses based on my success rate and efficiency. That alone was an incredible deal. </p><p>Then, there were additional lines about them supplying me with weapons with different enchantments if they needed me to repair anything other than a simple sharpness enchantment, as well as giving me the right to join the fighting for two hours under the protection of someone called Eleanor to help me level up. </p><p>There was even a line about compensation if I got attacked any other time than my leveling journeys. </p><p>It was a good deal. Too good, even. I looked at Rosie, whose smile looked very soft and friendly. At that moment, I realized that maybe I shouldn’t have just believed that I was lucky. Rosie had another reason for arranging it. </p><p>What, I didn’t know. I was tempted to pull back, but I couldn’t. I got greedy believed myself smart, and swallowed the bait. Now, I needed to deal with the consequences. At least they wouldn’t be deadly. </p><p>Rosie had a weird sense of humor, but she was not malicious … at least to people who didn’t antagonize her. </p><p>“I can’t believe we have to travel all day just to pick up a mere blacksmith,” the redhead muttered. </p><p>“Maria,” the armored one whispered, her tone kind but filled with a warning, no doubt warning her friend about being rude. Amusing. </p><p>“What, I’m right. We have more important things to worry about,” she said. </p><p>“You should have double-checked your calculations, then,” she replied, and the redhead blushed. It gave me a better idea of what was going on. Then, she turned to me. “I’m sorry about Maria, sir. It’s her first time leading an expedition and she’s tense. I’m Eleanor,” she said. </p><p>“Devon,” I said as we shook hands. “I hope that I can help you, but do you mind sharing the details.” </p><p>”Later,” Maria cut in, even more abrasive after she had been admonished. A spoiled student, indeed. Too bad I couldn’t threaten her by dropping her participation score. “We need to be at the camp at dawn. I don’t want to delay the raid any more than necessary.” </p><p>I looked at Rosie once more. She had explicitly mentioned that the dungeon was a week away. She responded with an amused smirk. “See you around, Devon,” she said with a big smirk. “Make sure to hang on tight.” </p><p>Then, it clicked. “We’re going to fly there,” I said, my face getting paler. </p><p>“Is there a problem?” Maria asked. </p><p>“No, just surprised,” I said, not willing to admit my … distaste for the spoiled young woman who was clearly looking for a chance to mock me. It would be unpleasant enough. </p><p>Eleanor seemed to catch the reason, but she just nodded. Not ideal, but better than nothing. </p><p>“Good. Then, let’s go. We have wasted enough time,” Maria declared as she stood up, her gaze locked on Rosie. “Make sure you hold the end of our bargain. You don’t want to cross my family,” she declared, with a hint of threat. </p><p>“Of course not,” Rosie replied, but I didn’t miss the way her smile tightened. Another mistake on Maria’s part. Rosie didn’t like being threatened. But, coming from someone that might as well be a spoiled trust fund kid — or, whatever the equivalent was in our new society — it was easier to shrug off. </p><p>Looking at their maturity, it was hard to believe that they were more or less at the same age, just below twenty-five. Then, I chuckled, realizing that, even in my mind, I sounded ancient rather than my true age, merely thirty-two. </p><p>Starting to work as a professor before my twenties distorted my perspective a bit too much on that. </p><p>“Let’s go,” Maria said as she looked at her bodyguard, and didn’t even look at me. I followed them after putting on my helmet. There was no hiding my identity from anyone relevant, but I rather not be a part of the gossip. </p><p>I followed them to the outskirts of the town and arrived at the gates. According to the laws, the gates were supposed to stay locked all night with no exception. Eleanor didn’t even need to say anything. She just made a gesture, and the guards opened the door, looking nervous. I would have understood if their nervous glance was targeting Maria, but they were looking at Eleanor like that. </p><p>There must be a story behind it, but I didn’t ask. I was too busy psyching myself to the upcoming encounter, wondering about the exact method of flying. The destruction of the technology meant there were no planes or helicopters — good riddance — but the replacements were hardly better. A slew of magical items, starting from flying carpets, replaced them. I never had the money to use them in the first place, so it didn’t matter until now. </p><p>But, when I saw our mode of transportation, I froze. Mounts. Flying mounts. Two griffins, tied to a tree like horses, a glowing shield around them, though whether to keep them captive or to protect them, I didn’t know. </p><p>“Have you ever ridden a Griffin?” Eleanor asked kindly. I shook my head, not in the mood to answer. “I’ll help you,” she said. I followed. The beast looked calm and obedient, not unlike a well-trained horse. I wasn’t scared of it, at least as long as it was on the ground. </p><p>As I climbed behind it, the straps of the saddle moved automatically to wrap around me. “Now, all you need to —” Eleanor started. </p><p>“Enough, we wasted too much time already,” Maria called from the other griffin, and started to fly. </p><p>“Sorry. Just relax and don’t worry. You don’t need to worry. It’s actually very safe,” Eleanor said, which only made my reticence worse. It reminded me of the constant insistence of the flight attendants about how their flying death traps were actually perfectly safe. </p><p>Then, the griffin stretched its wings, and we were in the air. I grabbed the saddle desperately and closed my eyes. It was worse than a plane. At least, there, as long as there was no turbulence, I could convince myself that I wasn’t flying. </p><p>It was impossible here, not with the wind flowing around my face like a whip. Not with every flap of the wings shaking us worse than even the worst tribulation. </p><p>Worse, soon, the cries of monsters reached my ears, interrupted by a sudden flash of red. I couldn’t keep my eyes closed, not with the monsters around us. I watched as Maria casually burning a flying monster that would have killed me instantly. </p><p>I hated my new job already. </p>",

    "content": "<p>As I passed in front of the recruiter, a hint of Qi invaded my body. However, considering I could hide my abilities from actual cultivators, a martial artist recruiter who was merely using an artifact was nothing. </p><p>The recruiter gave a signal to someone else, and soon, two people were following me. One of them moved forward first, and pulled me to an alley between tents. He was a burly, intimidating man, and as he pulled me, the other people retreated, some looking at the scene with fear, the others with pity. </p><p>“Give me everything you have,” he said even as he threw me to the ground. </p><p>I spat, making sure to let out some blood. He had hit me hard, and I wanted to make sure there was no suspicious quality. “I … I have nothing, sir martial artist,” I gasped, making sure to speak like a scared villager. It would explain my lack of martial arts better. </p><p>“Nonsense, you have your clothes, right?” he declared with a mocking tone as he kicked me. I grabbed his leg, acting like I was trying to prevent the hit. However, as I did so, I checked his martial arts, trying to check. </p><p>Interestingly, it was neither Tiger Fist, nor it was Everdawn Saber. It was just merely one of the ordinary martial arts that was in circulation. </p><p>“N-no, I won’t give up my dignity,” I tried to roar as I tried to fight back. It would have been a stupid move under the circumstances if I was as weak as I represented, which was a deliberate move. After all, I was trying to get recruited by a cult. Intelligence was not a favored trait by them, at least for the random recruits. </p><p>A few more kicks later, the second man that had been following me burst in. “How dare you attack the people of the camp, you bandit,” the other man had declared loudly even as he took a step forward. My ‘attacker’ tried to take him down as well, only for my ‘savior’ to grab his clothes and throw him to the ground. Once my ‘attacker’ hit the ground, he stilled, acting unconscious. </p><p>A poor production quality, but I wasn’t in a position to give them a detailed critique. Since their recruitment was lax enough, it was to my benefit. I could have sneaked around them easily, but a legitimate identity could give me a chance to leverage the System. </p><p>Instead, I started speaking before he could help me up. “Thank you for your great grace, martial master,” I bowed. “I won’t forget your grace.” </p><p>“No need to thank me, young man. I was impressed by your valiant defense. You have the heart of a martial artist. It would be a pity if it was shattered by a ruffian.” </p><p>“You think so, martial master,” I gasped. </p><p>“Of course,” he said as he made a show of checking my shoulders. I could see that he had some apothecary skills, barely enough to check someone’s aptitude. His eyes widened as he checked mine. I allowed him to detect only a portion of it, but it was still enough to make his eyes widen. “You have talent. More than I can teach. I need to bring you to my master,” he said. </p><p>However, even as he said that his greed was clear. Not that it surprised me. A young, gullible villager down on his luck with no training and excellent aptitude, I was prime recruiting material. His greed suggested that they worked on commissions, and I probably represented a few gold pieces at a minimum. </p><p>As for not teaching me directly, it was already out of the question. He was also using another random martial art. Teaching me meant he couldn’t sell me to the cult. </p><p>“I’m willing, martial master,” I said as I bowed, showing my enthusiasm as I treated this as my opportunity. He immediately brought me out of the camp, and to a nearby forest, talking about his great master and the martial school he had. I wasn’t faking my smile as I walked, feeling like he was bypassing a few steps on the way. </p><p>We only stopped when we were at the entrance of a concealed valley. “Wait here,” he said to me. “I need to talk to my senior brother.” </p><p>I waited as I promised, but using a formation to peek into the valley had been easy. I wasn’t afraid of them having a cultivator. No cultivator could sneak into the Kingdom without alerting me. </p><p>He was stopped by a guard. “Why are you here?” he asked. “The next delivery is five days away.” </p><p>“I have found an excellent talent. He’s more valuable than anyone else, and I didn’t want to risk him.” </p><p>“You just didn’t want your boss to steal your commission,” the guard grumbled. “You better hope you’re right. If you disturb the guardian for false news, you won’t like the results.” </p><p>My ‘savior’ shivered at his mention, but he still looked stubborn. “No, he’s an excellent talent. I guarantee it. I have never met someone that talented in my life.” </p><p>That surprised me. I had already limited my talent quite a bit. It was hard to quantify something like talent, but if I were to guess, I was merely showing off one percent of my talent. I sighed. Ultimately, it didn’t matter. If the worst happened and they got suspicious, I had too many ways to interrogate them directly before repeating the same trick in another recruitment spot. </p><p>“Are you sure he never practiced martial arts? You know the rules.”</p><p>“I know. The artifact confirmed it,” he replied. </p><p>“Very well. I want half of the reward,” the guard said. </p><p>“That’s robbery.” </p><p>“Either that or you can let your boss contact the guardian through usual channels,” the guard declared. “I’m also taking a risk here. Do you think the guardian will treat me kindly if I disrupt him during his meditation for no reason? We’re both risking our lives here.” </p><p>The guard didn’t seem like joking, which didn’t surprise me too much. The guardian was likely the Connate realm martial artist I could feel in the village, and depending on his personality, killing was an acceptable response to disrespect. </p><p>“A third at most,” the other countered. After five minutes of bargaining, they come to an agreement for the forty-sixty split. The guard went in, and when he came out, he was being followed by a man in his fifties, radiating a subtle smell of medicine which I identified as essence pills for initiates. </p><p>I wondered just how many people they recruited that even their recruitment agents were preparing essence pills. He had a stormy expression on his face, muttering about insulting an apothecary by letting him prepare such basic pills, confirming my guess. </p><p>“Is this the new recruit,” he said once he appeared, accompanied by the guards. “If he’s not as talented as you promised —” he started, but the moment he touched my shoulder, he froze. “Stand still,” he ordered to me. </p><p>I did so, a fearful expression on my face as a hundred and eight needles sank into my body without warning. The fear was naturally fake. His essence infused my body, searching my skin, bone, and heart, trying to find a hint of martial essence. </p><p>Since my essence was hidden by my Qi, he failed. And, as a martial artist, he lacked the ability to detect Qi. </p><p>Still, I made a note to set a formation on myself to hide my abilities before I arrived at their main base. I was always either hiding my essence in my Qi, or my Qi in my essence to avoid detection. It would be hard to hide both if a cultivator checked me. </p><p>Since the conspiracy included sending Foundation Establishment experts for errands, it was not out of the question to have Qi cultivators at the base. </p><p>Meanwhile, I was distracted by my attention. “Good, good, good,” the apothecary muttered, his expression getting more feverish even as he checked my cultivation more. He pulled a message talisman and activated it. The content of it was simple, alerting the discovery of a top-grade talent, and asking for early transport. </p><p>I sighed even as I caught the message, which was only due to closeness. Tapping into the message of talismans was not something easy, and only with a combination of formations and talismans, it was possible. Otherwise, I would be able to catch every message sent in the area my formation covered. </p><p>Then, he turned to the guard. “Give him a first-grade reward package,” he decreed, then paused. “Make sure to add two breakthrough pills as well,” he added as he grabbed me, dragging me away without even asking for my opinion. </p><p>Facing an expert, freezing in shock was an acceptable reaction, so I accepted it. </p><p>Still, I was surprised when, barely twenty minutes later, a flying boat arrived. It was a small one, and not a particularly high quality. “Step in,” the cultivator ordered. </p><p>I was once again glad for my identity as a poor villager, as it allowed me to gawk at the flying boat in shock, which gave me enough time to build the formation to hide both sides of my cultivation. </p><p>Still, I couldn’t help but wonder whether I had overdone with my talent when even a fraction was enough to make them send a cultivator to pick me up. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Of course, while I had decided to delve deeper into the issue of Martial Arts, I wasn’t actually planning anyone to practice Everdawn Saber. Not when it was clearly linked to the others. Instead, I decided to make a fact-finding mission. </p><p>My first destination was the capital, where I visited the royal library, and dug for some information on Everdawn Empire, but failed to find even a hint. Not that it surprised me. I already expected the sects to erase that information. </p><p>While I could visit every capital to make sure, I decided against it. The royal libraries were very difficult to scour. In the capital, I still held the command token passed to me by Aisnam, allowing me to mobilize the secret guard to help me. With their help, I scoured the library but failed to even find a hint. </p><p>Of course, I deliberately gave them vague directions, disguising it as a search for martial arts rather than history in case someone blabbed near a cultivator, but still, it worked. </p><p>“At least it was not for nothing,” I spoke to myself, looking at a pile of martial arts techniques in front of me, none of them useful on their own, but I still browsed them quickly for reference. My martial arts talent was already helpful, and the combat cultivation techniques I learned helped me to comprehend even more. </p><p>I wished that Aisnam was still here so we could brainstorm about new, needlessly complicated martial arts I created for fun. Unfortunately, she was recruited to a sect, and I had more important things to do. </p><p>Like discovering information about the Everdawn Empire. </p><p>Luckily, I had one clue, one that I could easily trace back to the source. The hidden attack formations. More importantly, their triggers. I went back to the ruins of the Spring Palace. As I walked among the rubble, I was still frustrated. Temporary or not, it had been a home. Now, it was gone, destroyed by an asshole cultivator for no other reason than to show off because I couldn’t just reveal my power. </p><p>“Later,” I muttered as I examined the formation, and tracked it back to the trigger. Or, triggers. There were three of them, probably to create some insurance in case of an accident. I tracked the triggers back to their source. </p><p>Tracing them back was simple, but only because I was an expert in both talismans and formations. Otherwise, it would have been far more difficult. I found the trigger talismans, which were some kind of modified message talismans, in the hands of civilian merchants in the outer city. A few questions to the neighbors under disguise revealed that all three had been living here for at least a decade. </p><p>Curious, I carefully examined them from a distance. They were using some mediocre martial arts, each using a different one. One of them was at Bone Forging, and the other two were at Skin Refinement, but they all had the ability to conceal themselves as mere Muscle Reinforcement artists, which was enough to operate in the outer city without catching attention. </p><p>Unfortunately, questioning them under revealed that they were just ordinary spies of Kartpa Valley, tasked to activate the talismans once they received a signal from their superiors, for which, there were many. And, tracing them back was not possible, as it would probably require me to penetrate the spy ring of Kartpa Valley, which was most likely outside the mortal kingdoms. </p><p>A dead end, but it gave me an idea of my own. Since they were trying to free the imprisoned people — the martial arts implying that they were people rather than creatures, at least at one point — from the stone gates, they must be trying to use the martial arts to empower them. </p><p>All I needed was to find them. Too bad, unlike the cultivators, there were too many martial artists for me to distinguish them by their totem. Even formations couldn’t help me, because I didn’t know what distinguished animal totems from spiritual pillars. </p><p>I sighed even as I wondered how else I could find them. However, as I walked, it suddenly clicked. The answer was simple. </p><p>The scale. </p><p>I didn’t know what those saboteurs wanted to do, but it was clear that regardless of whether their objective was to use the imprisoned beings to have a lot of second-class martial artists, or use them to empower the people who were trapped behind those stone doors, they would need a significant number of martial artists. </p><p>And, any such operation would leave a clue, which could allow me to limit the search radius. Once limited, I could use formations, interrogate them directly, or even challenge strong martial artists until I could find something suspicious. </p><p>Of course, if I had no choice, I could also mobilize the secret guard, but I had to explain to them what they were looking for. Even if I trusted their loyalty, particularly after Aisnam’s incredible display that solidified it even further, there were too many ways to interrogate martial artists. In the hands of a determined Foundation Establishment cultivator, they would have no secrets. </p><p>With that, I went back to the palace, and started delving on reports, trying to find a clue. After spending half a day, reading reports non-stop, I was able to find my first clue. </p><p>A cult called Golden Society. </p><p>The first thing that caught my attention was their name, indirectly reminding me of the sun. However, if it was the only source, I would have dismissed it. Apparently, they popped out of nowhere six months ago, though they were merely a local problem until the war forced a lot of people to depart their homes. </p><p>Like all cults, they were able to use the disasters to their benefit, increasing their recruitment. However, even in their increased state, the spies guessed their number was below a hundred thousand. It was supposed to be a shocking number, but since they didn’t target martial artists but weak refugees, their threat was downgraded significantly. </p><p>I would have blamed the intelligence officers, but considering their limitations, their decision wasn’t surprising. A hundred thousand weak mortals, particularly when split between many locations, wasn’t supposed to be a threat. </p><p>I would have ignored it if wasn’t looking for anything that could be connected to the name of Everdawn. And, even now, I believe that it was a stretch. However, since they were all within the borders of the Kingdom, checking them directly wouldn’t cost me too much time. </p><p>I had to steal a set of damaged clothes and add some disguise, making myself look exhausted and sickly. However, I made sure that it was a recent development due to my refugee status, still maintaining an intimidating stature. </p><p>However, that was not the most important part of my disguise. No, that honor went to the care I had shown to erase any hint of martial arts. The reports made it clear that Golden Society showed little intention to recruit people with martial arts experience, even the Initiates. </p><p>It didn’t surprise me. Martial arts required focus. While practicing multiple martial arts was not impossible, it was difficult. Not to mention, considering my assumptions, I suspected that Golden Society had reasons to be even more careful in avoiding it.</p><p>It was why, I did my best to look like a starving but strong young man with a lot of potential talent, and prime recruiting material when combined with my desperation. </p><p>“Sir, may I have a piece of bread? I’m willing to work all day,” I said as walked store after store, suddenly feeling nostalgic. It was just the way I acted when I first arrived as I did my best to fleece people for a few coppers or rotten bread. </p><p>Of course, back then, I was doing my best to succeed, and now, I was doing my best to fail. Not that I had to work hard. In a refugee camp, everyone was desperate, and any food, even moldy bread, was precious. </p><p>However, I had to avoid a couple gangs looking for recruits while looking like an accident, searching for someone suspicious. Soon, I felt a Qi flicker, and moved in that direction. I saw a middle-aged man, mixed with the rest, using a broken stone that he stimulated with his spirit stone to test people’s martial essence. </p><p>It looked like they didn’t want to make a mistake. </p><p>I wondered if they were afraid of spies, or if they were afraid of people with totem beast cultivators cultivating their spiritual pillar for some reason. </p><p>Of course, that made me think about Elsana and Lannayin, the only two people I met who didn’t have totem beasts. I didn’t care much back then, considering the ease I was able to create Forest Dance and other martial arts without my cultivation, but with my new perspective, it was clear that it wasn’t as ordinary. </p><p>I sighed, wishing that I had talked more about where they received them. Now, I questioned their disappearance with the sect's disciple. The rumor said that they had shown cultivation talent … but then, maybe it was something else. </p><p>That mystery, I ignored for the moment … knowing, deep in my bones, sooner or later, I would learn more about it. I wouldn’t have a choice. </p><p>For now, I walked toward the recruiter. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Sometimes, I hated being right. </p><p>Thanks to the flying boat, visiting all forty-two capitals didn’t take long. Only thirty-six of them actually had stone gates underneath, at least what I was able to discover, each guarded by Qi Gathering cultivators. </p><p>Of those thirty-six capitals, twenty-two were under Kartpa Valley’s sphere of influence. And, of those twenty-two, none of them had their protections intact. Including Markas, it made twenty-three. A dangerous number. Worse, every single one of them had trap formations around them, strong enough to take down Foundation Establishment cultivators, no doubt they were to kill the first responders. </p><p>They didn’t have any precautions against Golden Core cultivators, but presumably, whatever happened would happen before they could respond en masse. I doubted even the sects kept more than a couple Golden Cultivators nearby. </p><p>I had sabotaged those Formations subtly, but it didn’t solve the inherent problem. I couldn’t defend all those points all the time, certainly not against a mysterious enemy. Meaning, I had to understand exactly what they were trying to do. </p><p>And, that meant I had to get some information, from someone that I never wanted to talk to again — someone that might as well not be a human. Which meant, that no matter how little I wanted to do so, I needed to take a huge risk and touch the sealed knowledge in my mind. </p><p>For that exact purpose, I was back to Markas, standing in a new formation I had created for the exact purpose of cleansing my body if necessary. While I didn’t expect whatever was in my mind to suddenly take over when I was guarded, it never hurt to be prepared. </p><p>With a sigh, I reached to the sealed knowledge in my mind, and let it fill my consciousness. </p><p>The moment I did so, I cursed myself for the decision. The first thing I felt was pain, the unique kind that I only felt once, when I activated the language jade I had received from the sect disciple I faced when I had arrived for the first time, only rougher. </p><p>It was nothing like the smooth, elegant delivery of the System, which not only settled into my brain calmly, but also gave me the comprehension of the knowledge. It was more like a jagged piece of metal stabbing into my brain. The information exploded in my mind as I tried to process the flood at the same time. </p><p>I wondered if the information was supposed to hit that hard, or if my attempt at containment somehow made it degrade, making the absorption more difficult. Likely the second, as that being was trying to use me rather than trying to kill me. </p><p>However, as I processed the information I had received, I stopped wondering about the objective of that being and focused on the contents. </p><p>Shockingly, it was a martial arts technique. </p><p>“Or, at least, it’s supposed to be,” I muttered as I analyzed its structure. Even without a deeper comprehension, I could easily see that it fulfilled the conditions of martial arts … yet it was completely different from any martial arts technique I analyzed to this moment. </p><p>The most obvious difference. It wasn’t limited to the Connate realm. Not only that, it referred to all five stages of martial arts — Initiate, Muscle Reinforcement, Skin Refinement, Bone Forging, Connate — collectively as the third-class, which implied the existence of at least two more realms above it. It even included the breakthrough method from the third stage to the second stage, but nothing else. </p><p>Clearly, it was the bait of that being. A temptation for me to finally break through my bounds, giving me the strength to fight against Foundation Establishment cultivators. </p><p>I had to admit, it was an excellent bait for anyone else. As for me … it was still promising, but far from urgent. At this point, as long as I was near the spiritual vein, the Foundation Establishment cultivators didn’t even qualify as a threat. However, the potential was still valuable in the longer term. </p><p>Assuming that the technique was actually correct — which was not a given — it was promising. Sooner or later, I would have to rise to the upper realms, especially if I wanted to travel. However, I had no idea how to solve my lack of an Immortal Root. While I hoped that I could solve it with the System, having a potential alternative was always welcome. </p><p>So, unlike any other martial artist facing the temptation, I didn’t have the temptation to suddenly practice the skill and test its effects. Instead, I pulled a bunch of paper, and started to write the technique, as cleanly as I could manage. Not just to see if I could recycle it through the System to get a complete version, but to give myself a chance to understand it better. </p><p>My comprehension of cultivation techniques might as well be garbage, but the reverse was true for martial arts. On this topic, I was a genius even without the System. </p><p>As I analyzed, it didn’t take long for me to realize a huge difference between the martial arts techniques. Up until now, most of the martial techniques I had functioned based on totem beasts, and the strength of the totem determined both the power of the technique, and the upper limits of the power. However, they had also come with a side effect. The stronger the totem beast, the stronger the technique.</p><p>Even the volcano and blizzard arts, or my forest art, worked similarly, treating those concepts as generalized spirits. </p><p>The martial art technique I received, on the other hand, didn’t have a beast totem. It still has a totem, though it was called a spiritual pillar. And, from what I could sense, that pillar was supposed to be an Empire. I didn’t know exactly how an Empire could function the same way as a beast totem.</p><p>To be fair, I hardly understood how a beast totem actually functioned. </p><p>Many other questions flew to my mind, like what a totem actually was, how an empire could function as one … whether any other political entities could replace it. A kingdom, a tribe? A democratic republic? An anarcho-commune. </p><p>“An interesting question for the future,” I muttered as I continued to analyze the technique, trying to search for a weakness. The technique had some gaps due to the degradation it suffered, but no matter how much I analyzed it, I couldn’t see anything different from other martial arts. </p><p>Of course, it had many different moves and techniques, but none of those had anything out of order, like something that could allow a weakness to be possessed. While it was possible I was missing something, I didn’t think so. Especially when I had a very obvious suspect. </p><p>The spiritual pillar, which was supposed to be an Empire. And, not just any Empire, but a specific one. </p><p>One is called the Everdawn Empire. And, the technique was aptly called Everdawn Saber. </p><p>It made sense. Accepting an Empire as a spiritual pillar was certainly a subservient act, and it wasn’t shocking that it created some kind of mystic weakness against the higher-ups of the same Empire. After all, the whole concept of royalty relied on that kind of superiority. It might be mere fiction back on Earth, but I doubted the same applied here. The being imprisoned under the capital clearly had some link to the Empire, and </p><p>It certainly explained a lot. </p><p>Then, I shivered as I realized another very important detail, one that I had been ignoring up until now. If having an Empire as the spiritual totem was a potential weakness for possession, what did it mean to have a beast as a totem pillar? </p><p>I didn’t know, but it clearly wasn’t good. At least, I suspected it was the reason for martial artists were unable to break through. However, I didn’t rush to fix it. I wasn’t stupid enough to do so. Even discounting the very glaring risk of possession, trying to spread those techniques would be suicide. </p><p>If I could discover that, the sects, who had been keeping those beings trapped for some reason, clearly knew this fact as well. Yet, they were keeping it hidden. Some of the reasons were obvious. The biggest advantage sects had over mortal kingdoms was their higher-end power. However, the naming of the technique I received implied that, there were at least two more stages to it. </p><p>It would be far too hard to suppress the mortal kingdoms if they had martial artists that could rival Golden Core, or even Foundation Establishment cultivators. The sects might have stronger cultivators, but even if they stayed superior to the kingdoms, the balance would inevitably change if a Foundation Establishment cultivator couldn’t casually scare a city to submission. </p><p>A part of me wanted to just burn the pages in front of me and forget that I ever learned it, but I ignored that part. </p><p>The fact that I took over the spirit vein was enough to make me an enemy of Kartpa Valley. Even though I suspected that it was the work of a singular elder, eventually he would come for it. And, depending on the method he chose, it had a high chance of pitting me against a whole sect as long as I didn’t want to surrender the vein.</p><p>And, I wouldn’t. I was reluctant to do so in general principles, as having that vein was an unimaginable force multiplier for me. And, I certainly couldn’t do so before Pearyin returned. </p><p>Then, there was the fake mystic land, a potential invasion of Markas, another sect deciding to make trouble, and even a beast wave from the misty mountains — which apparently happened, just like a natural disaster. </p><p>No, with my luck, I didn’t have the luxury of ignoring such a potential force multiplier. </p><p>It was time for research. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I didn’t say much even as Astrid kissed me, expecting her to act hesitant once the initial shock had passed. She had given me the impression of a shy virgin. </p><p>But, I soon realized that I might have underestimated her. Virgin she might be, but shy, she was not. Not when she finally decided to act. Her fingers were already on my pants, enthusiastic to divest me from my clothing. </p><p>Curious about what she would do, I reached to her top, slowly untying the strings, curious whether she would stop. After all, we were still in a visible location. She did not. I thought about reminding her in case she had forgotten, but then decided against it. </p><p>She deserved to put on a show after peeking at us all those times. </p><p>Her clothes didn’t resist my tugs in the slightest, and soon, we were both equally naked. “You look beautiful,” I said even as she knelt down, her lips around my shaft. She closed her eyes as she pushed forward hard. </p><p>At that moment, I couldn’t help but suspect my earlier assessment. I had been sure that she never had any experience when it came to matters of flesh, but her actions made me reconsider it … for only a fleeting second. Her eyes widened in shock as my cock invaded her throat, enough to confirm that the sensation was utterly unfamiliar to her. </p><p>When the realization hit, it took all I had to not laugh out loud. Astrid was just as inexperienced as I assumed, but she was stubborn. Stubborn enough that, in her anger, she was more than ready to show Lillian she was better than her. </p><p>Even if that meant her first sexual experience was a desperate deep throat. </p><p>A nicer man might have helped her to stop, but I found her self-inflicted challenge too entertaining to stop. Instead, I have done something I wanted to do since we first met. I grabbed her breasts. </p><p>“They feel incredible,” I said. “Certainly the best I have ever felt.” </p><p>“Of course. I’m not one of your Roman girls that can starve any day,” she replied, pulling back just to mock Lillian, even as she coughed and wheezed. Her determination was impressive. While Lillian didn’t have her curves, she certainly wasn’t thin enough to justify such an insult. </p><p>I knew that intimately, because Lillian was merely a hundred feet away, between two trees for concealment, already naked, playing with herself as she enjoyed the show. It was a good visual reminder. </p><p>When Astrid closed her eyes to focus on her self-appointed task, I waved at Lillian. She responded in kind before focusing on her own task. “Why don’t you show me just how much better,” I said as I pulled out, only to slide between her breasts, pressing them together. </p><p>“L-like this,” she stammered as I fucked her tits, but her reaction didn’t prevent her from leaning down to capture the tip with her lips while my hips rocked. Astrid moaned loudly when she pulled back, making no attempt to restrain herself. </p><p>An obvious challenge to Lillian. I could see her standing in the distance, but I gestured for her to stay in place. Lillian looked frustrated and disappointed, but not enough to disobey my silent order. Good. </p><p>While the idea of them using me as a challenge in their weird rivalry was fun, Astrid was already pushing herself outside her comfort zone recklessly. </p><p>I didn’t want her to go too far and panic. I still needed her to teach me properly. While what she had taught me proved useful, ultimately, it was just the beginner stuff. That meant I had to make sure she was comfortable, no matter how much Lillian wanted to push her. </p><p>And, it wasn’t like getting a titjob from her while her pouty lips caressed my shaft was not amazing. I focused on the feeling, ignoring the fact that I could push her down and have my way with her. A fact that wasn’t appreciated by not just Lillian, but also my foreign instincts, roaring in protest. </p><p>Patience, I repeated even as I used the opportunity to get even more familiar with my instincts, hoping that it would help me to align with my vitae more. </p><p>I stayed passively, battling my foreign instincts and the pleasure at the same time, until my body finally surrendered to the pleasure, filling Astrid’s mouth with not only my seed but also mana. </p><p>“One delivery of mana, just as requested,” I whispered. Astrid shivered with pleasure as I leaned down, ready for more. Too bad there was one logical reason to stop. “Why don’t you go and meditate, so we can make sure it works for your magic as well.” </p><p>“T-that makes sense,” Astrid replied as she licked her lips, her tone an intriguing mix between disappointment and relief, showing that I wasn’t the only conflicted soul. She stood up and walked toward the spring, her naked hips enough to make me curse myself for listening to logic. </p><p>Still, that disappointment didn’t last long. She wasn’t going anywhere… </p>",

    "content": "<p>While watching Astrid retreat was disappointing, it didn’t distract me for long. Lillian arrived soon after. </p><p>“What happened? She looks even more distracted,” Lillian said. I gave her a quick summary of everything, including the fact that I managed to establish a rudimentary control over my transformation, and the conditions for it. </p><p>“Sounds promising. Can you show me?” she said. “I should check it as well, just in case.” I presented my arm silently, and she once again cast a healing spell, focusing on diagnostics … only for it to bounce from my scales. </p><p>“What was that,” she gasped. </p><p>“I don’t know. It never happened before,” I said. “Try again.” She repeated the attempt twice. Both times, the scales refused her magic. She cast it on my other arm. It worked. “Try to cast a weak water blade on the scales,” I ordered. </p><p>That earned an incredulous gaze from her. “Are you mad? I won’t start cutting you just for an experiment,” she said. </p><p>I frowned. “Why?” I said. “It’s the fastest way to understand the limits, and whether it’s only effective on healing magic.” </p><p>She just sighed. “Because normal people don’t cut and mutilate themselves just to get results faster,” she said patronizingly. I shrugged. It felt normal to me. “Just hold your arm. I’ll try to cast in stronger.” </p><p>With that, she closed, her healing spell turning into a bright glow. She put her fingers on my arm as she attempted to diagnose again. This time, it worked, and her mana managed to infuse my arm. But, that lasted only for a second before her mana had been ejected. </p><p>“Did it work?”I asked. </p><p>“No, the spell destabilized the moment it went into your scales. It’s impossible to get any proper result from it.” </p><p>I frowned. That was not exactly good news, making me wonder what would happen to my elemental cores when the transformation reached further. But, like many things I had been dealing with, it was a problem for the future. “Let me show you how it works, then?” I replied as I repeated the earlier trick, letting the transformation fade momentarily even as I let my anger on the surface. </p><p>However, this time, I let it grow back before releasing my control, so instead of pain, I merely dealt with a stinging sensation. Not exactly comfortable, but a great distance away from the alternative nonetheless. </p><p>“You need to learn how to repeat it without triggering the dragon heart,” she said. “Otherwise, you’ll just hasten the transformation.” </p><p>“True,” I answered. “I’m not in a hurry to hasten the transformation. Meaning, I can’t practice it too long without your … help.” </p><p>Lillian frowned. “It won’t work. I can barely able to transform all the mana you provide. Any more, and I’ll hit a limit.” She paused, looking at Astrid, who was working on her own magic to distract herself. “You might need her assistance.” </p><p>“I’ll think about it. Still, I don’t want to push her too much,” I said. “You’ll have to work harder to turn it into vitae.” </p><p>That earned a frustrated glare from her. “You have to pick one. I can either focus on getting stronger or try to improve my control. Unless, of course, you want me to just dump my mana into some large spells.” </p><p>“No. If we do that, sooner or later, we’ll be discovered,” I countered. “Now, do you want to ‘help’ me a bit before you focus on your meditation?” </p><p>“A good idea,” Lillian admitted as she grabbed my hand, dragging me deeper into the woods, though not deep enough to actually hide what we were doing from Astrid. </p><p>It took an hour for me to pass the majority of the mana I collected to Lillian, and I went back to meditating. </p><p>The fact that my scales were pushing the mana away was not a fun realization, making the task of controlling the transformation even more critical. I closed my eyes, letting my anger coax those primal instincts. </p><p>This time, however, I wasn’t in a hurry to use those instincts as a bridge to control the transformation. I had already learned that it was a viable path. Now, I needed to master the mindset just like Astrid’s holy warriors, until I could establish that control without a mental clutch. </p><p>I closed my eyes, taking deep breaths even as I resonated with the scales under the influence of anger, my mana reserves already in the process of being refilled. With that anger as a bridge, I was able to replicate the control, allowing the scales to pull back … but the moment I abandoned it, I lost control. </p><p>For hours, I repeated it again and again, with no progress, which was not exactly shocking. I was not only trying to learn a completely new branch of magic, but also trying to adapt to my extremely unusual circumstances. Immediate success was not to be expected. </p><p>Of course, that didn’t make the lack of success any less frustrating. I concentrated more and more … until I was distracted by a frustrated shout from Lillian, followed by a flare of mana. “Here, I destroyed the target,” she growled loudly. </p><p>Curious, I opened my eyes and walked closer. Soon, I saw them standing against each other, their frustration clear. Lillian had thrown her sling on the ground. Instead, in her hand, a water blade was glowing. </p><p>Luckily, she wasn’t threatening Astrid. She was just pointing at several ranged targets at a distance, more than half already destroyed. “I don’t need to be good at that stupid toy. Not when I have my magic,” Lillian said. </p><p>I couldn’t help but smirk as I noticed that, this time her anger wasn’t completely fake. She was clearly frustrated. It looked like her continued failure to learn how to use a mundane weapon frustrated her. As I closed, I could feel her magic, surging as she let out a shocking pressure. </p><p>I took a moment to appreciate just how much stronger since we first met. Astrid, however, caught her gaze bravely despite the pressure that was enough to make her knees tremble, a combative expression on her face. “Just because you can cheat doesn’t mean you have good aim,” she replied. “You’re the one that asked my help. You have to follow my rules. And my first rule is no using your cursed magic.” </p><p>“Then, teach me properly, and not just give me a toy,” she said even as she raised her hand, a large sphere of water rotating threateningly. That made Astrid even angrier. “The whole point of this training is for me to learn how to use this cursed magic better so I can save your ass, you ungrateful barbarian. You need me.” </p><p>“I don’t need you!” Astrid answered. “I have my tamed beast already. Soon, I’ll be strong enough to fight.” </p><p>“Of course you need me,” Lillian answered with a dark chuckle, but I could see that she had already managed to control her anger. She wasn’t one to indulge in pointless fury. However, I didn’t walk away for a simple reason. While her anger was gone, she continued to act like she was actually furious. I was curious about what she was trying to do. </p><p>“Either that or you have to beg Marcus to save you again. Either way, it doesn’t matter. You’re weak, barely in third order. How long do you think for you to properly tame that beast? And even if you do, so what? Do you think a mere second-order beast survives this?” </p><p>With that, Lillian raised her hand, and the sphere started to rotate before it jumped forward, punching through a nearby rock. </p><p>Astrid said nothing, angry, but also helpless. Lillian certainly had a point when it came to power. Just to drive it deeper, she held her hand, conjured another sphere, and destroyed another rock. Then, another one. </p><p>Of course, in actuality, the show wasn’t as impressive as it looked. Lillian spent too much time gathering each sphere, and their rotation was unstable. Then, even targeting large rocks, her aim wasn’t exactly exemplary. I was already planning training to compensate for those deficiencies. </p><p>However, Astrid’s knowledge of elemental magic was effectively nonexistent, making the show even more impressive in her gaze. “You want power. I’ll show you power,” Astrid growled even as she dashed away … toward where I had been meditating. </p><p>Before she could arrive, I went back there with a rapid dash. Astrid arrived a minute later. I expected her to be still furious, but that anger was mostly gone, replaced by a shy expression. “Marcus, can I ask for your help?” she asked demurely while also pushing her chest out. </p><p>Her ploy was obvious, but I acted unaware. “Whatever you want —” I started, which was all I was able to say before she closed in the distance and kissed me. </p><p>It looked like she decided to take the same shortcut with Lillian. </p><p>I was more than happy to help her. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Astrid’s footsteps quickened as I grunted in pain and frustration. I opened my eyes and looked at my scaled arm, expecting to find a mangled, bloodied mess, but only to find a pristine limb, one that was covered with scales. </p><p>That was good. Even better was the spread of the scales, which hadn’t expanded any further. But, that was all I was able to examine before Astrid arrived with a shocked expression on her face. “Are you well?” she asked, her hands twitching to reach my scales. Thankfully, she had enough presence of mind not to touch without my permission. She limited herself to a visual inspection. But, with my arm angled, she wasn’t able to see much. </p><p>“Yes. I was trying to make the scales grow just like you taught me, but it was more painful than I expected,” I said. I had been doing the exact opposite, of course, but it was an easy lie to tell. I was already dealing with a transformation I couldn’t stop despite my best efforts. There was no harm in believing that my pain was the result of trying to hasten the process like Astrid wanted, rather than reversing it. </p><p>“And, were you successful?” she asked. </p><p>“Check yourself,” I said as I stretched my scaled arm, and presented it to her. </p><p>The moment she saw my arm, she looked shocked. She didn’t exactly gasp, but it was a close thing. It was understandable. While today’s transformation had only added a few scales, it wasn’t an insignificant number. </p><p>After all, her explanation made it clear that raising a true shapeshifter — or, a holy warrior as she called it — required years even under ideal circumstances. She took my arm silently, dragging her finger over my scales. “Is there anything wrong?” I asked. </p><p>“Not particularly,” she said. “I was just surprised by the development of the transformation,” she said. “It’s … unusual.” Her attitude was enough to tell me that it was something more than just unusual, but I let her get away with that obvious lie. </p><p>“I tried to follow your explanation. Is there anything wrong?” I asked. </p><p>“Not particularly,” she said. “The scales look strong and correctly formed, which means you infused them with enough essence. Still, you need to be careful. Dilute the essence too much, and you might corrupt the transformation. And, without the original immaculate beast, we can’t fix it.” </p><p>“I’ll be more careful,” I said. For a moment, I considered pulling my arm back, not letting her check my arm magically, knowing that she would find something that ran contrary to her expectations. But, I killed that thought as soon as it occurred. My transformation was still not under my control, and sooner or later, she would realize the irregularity of it. </p><p>It was better to slowly introduce her to the secret, from an angle she would find the least offensive. “Why don’t you check it magically, just in case,” I offered. </p><p>“It would be my honor if you’re willing,” she said, and only after I nodded she extended her magic over the scales, caressing them like they were holy relics as she cast her spell.</p><p>As I watched her, I came to a sudden realization. She was not just fascinated by my scales, but also revering them. To her, holy warrior was not just a statement. </p><p>It was my Roman upbringing that had made me mistake that fact. To us, gods were to be respected, certainly, but other than certain days and ceremonies, religion was stuck to the temples, handled by the priests and priestesses who were forbidden from holding mortal positions. </p><p>It was one of the oldest laws, a leftover from the days when Rome was still ruled by the kings. It didn’t change, not when the kings were overthrown and the Republic was established, or when the Republic burned in the fires of civil war. Even when the Republic split into two, and the East declared itself an Empire, that rule was followed. </p><p>The only other law that was followed with such fervor was the sacred, untouched nature of Pomerium, a holy ground at the center of the city of Rome, the birthplace of Rome itself. </p><p>And, with the religion truly isolated from both politics and military — not that there was much distinction between the two as far as Rome was concerned — I had dismissed the significance of the name holy warrior. </p><p>An absurd oversight. In my defense, I had too many things to think about. </p><p>I watched Astrid with that realization, who caressed my scales absentmindedly, easily infusing them with her mana. She only examined the scales, never bypassing the limits I had requested of her, even though she had no reason to suspect I could actually control it, unaware of the true lengths of my mana sensitivity. </p><p>That kind of respect made it tempting to open more, and let her examine my body completely. Too bad that my possession of elemental cores made opening up a risky proposition, certainly when she was concerned. </p><p>However, soon, her expression of relevance shifted, turning into shock. She abandoned her attempts to contain her shock and gaped. “How could it be?” she gasped. </p><p>“What do you mean?” I asked. </p><p>She paused even as the power that gathered on her fingers got stronger. I could see the conflict on her face. Together, it was clear that she was considering she had finally noticed something extraordinary about the scales, enough to make her consider whether to violate her promise of only examining the scales and nothing more. I didn’t blame her for it. In her place, I would have certainly done so. </p><p>But, I was certainly happier to see she had ignored the temptation and kept her spell focused on my scales. It showed that I could trust her. Not with the full range of my secrets, and certainly not immediately, but it was still useful. </p><p>“What’s the verdict?” I asked. </p><p>“It’s not what I expected,” she said. “For such a quick progress, I assumed you have spread your existing essence thinner. It was a quick way to hasten the transformation, but an ill-advised method, limiting the future potential of a holy warrior. Yet, it’s not like that. The essence you have in each scale is even stronger.” </p><p>“Is there a problem?” I asked. </p><p>“Not exactly a problem, but creating new essence is a slow process. What you have just achieved should take at least a month, and that’s with external essence being continually fed from an immaculate beast.” </p><p>I made a show of frowning to look like I was in deep thought. “Maybe it was about my ability to collect mana from the environment. Lillian mentioned that mana I collected and kept in my body was much easier to convert to water vitae than mana she gathered herself.” </p><p>Astrid paused, looking thoughtful. “That makes sense, I suppose,” she said hesitantly. I could see that she was reconsidering the strategic implications of my ability, even though it was a much-reduced version of my true ability. </p><p>I could see her beautiful green eyes alight with greed and temptation. After all, it was one thing for Lillian to brag about the benefits of our special ‘mana transfer’ sessions. Maybe she took Lillian’s bragging as an exaggeration, not understanding the true extent of her improvement. She must have assumed that Lillian was getting just a minor boost. After all, Lillian was still plenty strong when they met. </p><p>Seeing the same impact on my scales, in a way she could quantify the impact was something different. Suddenly, it was something relevant to her. Something she could give the power she desperately needed, something that would help her once our deal came to an end and we separated. </p><p>I didn’t know just how strong she was compared to the other priestesses, but it didn’t matter. The allure of more power was always tempting. </p><p>It was something I understood. After all, I had spent years doing my best to get stronger, even though I yearned for freedom. One that I couldn’t just get by escaping from the estate. After all, what did freedom mean if I had to hide like a rat, bowing and scraping? </p><p>No, power was necessary for freedom. </p><p>And, at this moment, I could see that exact same expression on Astrid. Not that it was a surprise. Betrayed and hunted by her own tribe, and saved only by a coincidence, Astrid’s situation was one I could easily emphasize. Her temptation was equally understandable. </p><p>I had a feeling that all I needed at this moment was to make a move and kiss her to convince her of the benefits of our method. However, I decided not to do so, even though I welcomed to have someone else to assist me in keeping my mana levels below the limit. </p><p>The reason was simple. I had already taken advantage of her enough. I wasn’t willing to push her on such an intimate topic. If she wanted to do that, she needed to take that step on her own. </p><p>“I …” she muttered, temptation on her face clear. Yet, after a moment, she stood up. “I will leave you to your meditation. You’re making excellent progress,” she said. </p><p>And, retreated. </p><p></p>",

    "content": "<p>I disliked Broken Tankard. </p><p>It was a loud and crowded pub, filled with people who were far too happy to start throwing punches at the slightest disagreement. It was something I hated even before people started to have superpowers, and violence had become a perfectly acceptable form of self-expression once more. Also, the drinks were overpriced and terrible, and the food was even worse. </p><p>Despite all those, it had one redeeming factor, one that made sure I had to visit the place many times. It housed the single most active job board in the whole town for the people who were not a part of the guilds. People looking for parties, specialist jobs, trainers, guides, miners… </p><p>I bypassed the crowd and walked toward the receptionist's desk. Only to be interrupted by a familiar face. “Wow, that’s a sight for the sore eyes, Devon. Do you need information on the dungeons again, or are you buying information on the other towns?” Rosie greeted me. “We have managed to connect with another cluster, and I have some interesting stuff for you.” </p><p>Rosie was an interesting woman. She was young, cheerful, personable … and absolutely deadly in combat. I didn’t know what her class was, but it was clearly something better than a mere warrior. I had seen her go through a large group of wannabe gangsters who decided that trying to force her to pay a protection fee was a smart decision. </p><p>It was not. There was a reason it had turned into the defacto center for the independents. She had enough strength to ensure that she could hold the payments in escrow without being targeted by thieves — naturally, for a modest fifteen percent cut — or intervene as a third party in case of disputes. </p><p>She wasn’t exactly a bank, but it was close. </p><p>She was also too important to deal with an unimportant washed-up Blacksmith who made wrong bets in this new world until he turned completely irrelevant, but I had been a customer of hers since the beginning, so we had some rapport. </p><p>I shrugged. “Unfortunately, no,” I answered as I lifted my pouch, which was noticeably empty. “This time, I’m looking for a job.” </p><p>She frowned. “Follow me,” she said as she gestured, and I followed her to her office. “Don’t tell me you’re having problems with the workshop. Is it Mark?” </p><p>I wasn’t surprised that Rosie knew about my new supervisor even though it had been a while since my last visit. Her business relied on information. “No, he’s annoying, but not enough to kick me out. I’m still the only one that can repair the sharpness-enchanted weapons.” </p><p>She said nothing, and I sighed. I had already made that decision, but it didn’t make sharing any easier. “I decided to take a different job. Outside,” I commented. </p><p>That earned a raised eyebrow. “That’s a change of pace for you,” she commented. “What happened to Mister I’m-not-a-barbarian-thank-you-very-much.” </p><p>I shrugged. “He has been screwed up because he has misread the situation,” I said with a shrug. </p><p>“Oh, it’s rare for you to admit that,” she said. “What are you looking for?” </p><p>“Preferably as a part of the group that’s not filled with complete idiots,” I said. “Security over speed, but I need at least three gold coins as payment, but I wouldn’t say no to more,” I explained the conditions. </p><p>My request was not excessive. Three gold coins were hard to earn in the town, but the same wasn’t true for expeditions outside. A good working day meant somewhat around one and a half silver for me most days, and that was with working overtime. </p><p>Meanwhile, even a mediocre day outside for a hunting party brought more revenue. Anyone with revenue below five silver would be complaining about a slow day, and a good hunter easily had a revenue of twenty silvers a day. A gold coin in five days. </p><p>An incredible business … but one with a terrible rate of mortality. The exact rate was hard to pin down with many hunters going to long expeditions, sometimes choosing to just settle in another town without informing anyone. </p><p>Still, even without exact numbers, it was enough that a hefty hazard premium for the jobs outside the wall had become common place, with three times being the accepted benchmark, adjusted by the exact circumstances and need. </p><p>Meaning, that just by accepting to repair weapons outside, I could expect to earn at least five silvers a day rather than one and a half at a minimum. More if it was a more dangerous job, or it was something that required my abilities. </p><p>The post-Cataclysm economy was difficult to understand, especially without a central authority to guide it. </p><p>The only thing that prevented it from completely collapsing into barter was the System. For some reason, the dungeons actually produced money. Not just metals, but actual coins, stamped by the System. It was possible to melt them, but considering they were the only currency accepted in the System Stores, no one was stupid enough to do that for material gain. </p><p>Ordinary gold and silver were far less valuable. </p><p>Of course, I still didn’t understand why a hundred copper coins equaled a silver coin, and a hundred silver coins equaled one gold. It was a weird fixed exchange rate … or not so much, not in a world where monsters popped from every corner and every single person had superpowers.   </p><p>“Perk Reset stone?” she asked. I nodded, not surprised by her accurate guess. “You want to switch to Efficient Repair.” </p><p>“Looks like the best method,” I replied. “With the repair spell getting more and more ubiquitous, it looks like the best way.” </p><p>She paused, hesitant. Interesting. </p><p>Of course, I didn’t believe that she was actually hesitant. Not even for a second. While I trusted myself to read people well — one benefit of working as a professor for years — Rosie wasn’t as easy to read. I saw her hesitation, because she wanted me to see. “Come on, let’s not waste time. Just spill it,” I said. </p><p>She frowned before her expression settled to a calm smile. “Fine, ruin my fun,” she said. “You want to change skill just because you want to make money, right?” I nodded. “There’s a better way for you to do so. It’s still a secret, but…” </p><p>“Let me guess. You’re willing to introduce me to them for a finder’s fee,” I said. </p><p>“It’s good to do business with smart people,” she said. “It’s such a pity that you didn’t get a class with Intelligence.” </p><p>I didn’t respond to that. Rosie was too smart not to know my frustrations about that topic, meaning she was doing it intentionally to unsettle me. Another trick that my old career as a professor helped me to handle. Mobbing through snide comments was hardly unfamiliar. </p><p>She seemed to realize that it wasn’t effective, but that didn’t seem to bother her. I liked her, but she was not a particularly nice person. “A new dungeon is discovered. It’s about a week’s travel,” she said. </p><p>“I see,” I replied, tensing. “You want me to join there? Why?” </p><p>“Yes, and for payment, I just want you to write a report.” </p><p>“Really?” I asked. “Even if I don’t have Perception or Intelligence.” </p><p>She waved her hand. “I’m not worried about it. You might not have a good class, but I’m aware of just how much you know about them,” she commented. “I just need a detailed report from you about the dungeon, and I’ll not even ask for a cut.” </p><p>Coming from anyone else, that statement would have scared me. Despite my best efforts, I didn’t know much about the dungeons, but considering their importance, even the little knowledge I had could have turned me into a target. The only reason it didn’t scare me was the fact that Rosie was the middleman for all those transactions, and knew exactly how much I knew. Not to mention, my research focused more on the general details and how it affected the nearby towns rather than more militaristic details that people cared about. </p><p>While I spent a lot of money collecting data, it was not something most people found useful. I wasn’t trying to find the ideal skill and class combination to raid a dungeon efficiently, but to understand its impact on the communities around.   </p><p>Ironically, it made me even better for her purposes. However, it was clearly not as simple. </p><p>The discovery of a new dungeon was not a simple thing. Every dungeon was essentially a pocket universe, or at least some kind of expanded space. Their geography and the hazards hidden had little to do with the location they were in. </p><p>They were also filled with all kinds of monsters, some just enlarged beasts, some too hard to contemplate. Every step of a dungeon might result in death. Yet, people raided them regularly. One reason for survival. Letting a dungeon sit untouched too long was never a good idea. Its potential continued to build up … until one day, it broke, spreading those nightmares around. </p><p>Yet, that wasn’t the reason people were desperately searching for dungeons. They searched for it, because every dungeon represented a giant economic opportunity. There was no guarantee what kind of treasures it would spawn. The repair spell it had generated that ruined my income was a good example. </p><p>“And, they need a blacksmith?” I asked. “One that can repair enchanted weapons? Why?” It was obvious with her comment about not changing my perk. </p><p>“The dungeon doesn’t have any mana,” she explained. </p><p>A smile appeared on my face. That changed things. Unlike Health, which was easily replenished by food, mages relied on the mana from their surroundings to replenish it. A cheap, renewable source was why a repair spell had ruined our business. While it took half a day for me to repair an enchanted weapon, they could repair dozens with ease. </p><p>A scale I could never match. </p><p>But, if the dungeon had no mana, it meant that they had to rely on mana potions and other portable sources. And, those methods were expensive, ridiculously so. </p><p>Meaning, I would not only get far more money than I expected, but also I would be an important part of their logistic. The more importance I had, the safer I would be because the fighters would protect me. </p><p>As far as risking my life went, it was a good deal. </p><p>“That sounds like a fascinating deal,” I said. “But, I have two conditions.” She nodded, gesturing me to speak. She didn’t warn me about not having any excessive requests, as I wasn’t a moron. I might be lucky enough that my unique perspective was valuable, but it had limits. </p><p>And, it was safer to leave things on the table than to push excessively. </p><p>“One, I need a small storage room. I need a place to keep my books and other stuff,” I said. </p><p>“Easy.” </p><p>“And, I want you to negotiate with the expedition for me. You can take a ten percent cut from my share,” I added. </p><p>“Oh, interesting,” she said. “Sometimes, I’m forgetting how smart you are. Fifteen percent.” </p><p>“Deal,” I said. As much as I needed money, Rosie’s involvement would help more. Not only did she know the details of the expedition better than I did and could assess the value better, but also it was a way to signal her protection. </p><p>Working with a bunch of people I didn’t recognize, it was better safe than sorry. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I liked having a nice glass of white wine while making monumental decisions, preferably a French Riesling of a decent vintage. </p><p>Unfortunately, it was not a luxury I was able to afford any more. Pre-cataclysm goods had long turned into an incredible luxury, even the cheapest box of wine would probably go for a gold coin during an auction. I didn’t think I could survive even seeing the price tag of my favorite vintage for such occasions. </p><p>Not when I couldn’t afford even the local moonshine. With only forty copper in my pocket, I would be skipping dinner for the next week and instead eat more during lunch — the greatest, and only perk my current work offered. </p><p>I took the long road back home, enjoying the bustle of the streets. It was a rare treat, as I was usually working during the day. And, it was rare to see people on the streets during the night. While it had been almost three weeks since a curfew had been declared, people were still reticent walking around during the night, afraid of another breach. </p><p>Not exactly an unjustified fear. The monsters were far more active during the night, and while the town had both walls and multiple patrols, they weren’t exactly a guarantee of safety. If they were, the last emergency curfew wouldn’t have been just weeks away. </p><p>I let my finger dance at the handle of my hammer even as I examined the buildings that were a mixture of wood and stone, with no signs of pre-Cataclysm architecture. They had been long destroyed during the first months of the disaster, the rebar steel in the walls far more valuable than anything else. </p><p>Though, they weren’t the only things that had been destroyed. Anything that contained metal had been long destroyed, usually cast into bars, forged into weapons that had been destroyed just as quickly as they had been made. </p><p>That trend finally stopped after the discovery of the first System store, allowing the exchange of goods and materials. It wasn’t cheap, but an enchanted sword in the hands of a high-level warrior was far more valuable than a thousand held by others. </p><p>The discovery of the System store was the first real hit for the production classes. Before, we were a critical part of the defense. Not just Blacksmiths, but Farmers, Carpenters, and many others. After the System store had been discovered just fifty miles away, that changed. We had been first reduced to repairing, and even that was the risk. </p><p>“Such fascinating developments,” I muttered. Despite all the problems it created for me, I was still captivated by the developments. After all, I was still one of the premier sociologists in the world. It was my passion to understand how human behavior shapes and shaped by various social aspects. </p><p>The irony was that, even as humanity was going through its single greatest change, I neither had the time nor the data to understand what was going on. And, no one cared about it, because my class didn’t have Intelligence as a stat.  </p><p>When I arrived at my home — a tiny room that was more similar to a prison cell than a residence — I found a paper hanging on my door. </p><p>A notice, declaring that, by next week, my rent would be increased from three silvers a week to five silvers. A very steep increase. “That might as well happen,” I growled even as I ripped it off. The room was already near the wall, and absent of anything that could be framed as luxury other than being a single-person residence — including a window. </p><p>But, I couldn’t live in a shared room. Not because I would hate it, but because I needed the space. I opened the door, carefully shuffling through piles of paper that covered every inch of the room, each half as tall as me. </p><p>The reason I had to live alone. My library. </p><p>Everything I was able to find went from home to home while people destroyed every inch of the old buildings. I didn’t know if anyone else bothered to save old books, but even if they did, they were probably hoarding them as much as I did. </p><p>While the pre-Cataclysm wine went for exaggerated prices, the same wasn’t true for the old books — for any other classical art form, but those I didn’t care as intensely — which had been mostly treated as a nuisance. </p><p>Instead, people cared about the new books, ones that had been either acquired through dungeons or purchased through the System store, describing the secrets of the magic, skills, and perks, some magical enough to directly improve the skill proficiency of anyone that was lucky to read it. </p><p>Compared to those, some old college textbooks weren’t particularly valuable. </p><p>Getting a shared room meant I had to get rid of all. </p><p>“God, I need a drink,” I growled as I threw myself on the bed, burying my face into the pillow. I had too many decisions to make. The first one was whether to continue applying to the newly established research centers, hoping that someone would allow me to work there. I was willing to work for free as long as I could get a closet to sleep in. I was even willing to bribe someone — unfortunately, I lacked the money to do so. </p><p>Focusing on acquiring the Perk Reset stone was another option. If I worked hard enough and sold all my assets — including my hammer, I thought even as my fingers brushed against the handle — I might be able to afford it before my skill had been improved. Even then, it was a close call. The latest price increase had truly surprised me. </p><p>Then, of course, there was my nascent library. The increase in rent meant that just to maintain my room was enough to cut my weekly savings by almost half. </p><p>I closed my eyes, trying to ignore the sudden, suffocating weight. Desperate, I reached my mind, calling the System, seeing eight lines of text that were more important than anything else I had done in the past, and would do in the future.  </p><p>[Blacksmith - Level 7] </p><p>[Health 210/210]</p><p>[Vitality 14 / Strength 14 / Dexterity 7]</p><p>[Skills (3/5)</p><p>Repair (Common) - 24 [Analyze]</p><p>Forge (Common) - 8 </p><p>Overhead  Strike (Basic) - 4 ]</p><p>“Depressing,” I muttered even as I dismissed the screen. None of the information there was a mystery, or even changed recently. With the sole exception of [Repair], the last time one of my skills had was a year ago, when I was forced to fight against a runaway monster,, and it was even longer before I actually leveled up. </p><p>I neglected leveling up for two reasons. For once, it wasn’t really valuable when it came to repair work. Most of the time, repairing a weapon only required a fraction of my Strength, and increasing it more wasn’t exactly a priority. </p><p>Of course, if it was just the relative uselessness, I would have still worked to level up. Extra power and health were not something I would turn up my nose in such a dangerous world.  But, there were two problems with it. </p><p>The first problem was simple. The stronger someone, the higher the cost of living. The higher levels required more energy, which meant more food consumption, preferably higher quality with more energy density.</p><p>It was problematic enough. Then, there was the fact that, it was expensive for a Blacksmith to level up. The easiest spots to level up had long been monopolized by the stronger groups, both the dungeons and the wilderness. </p><p>Anyone that wanted to level up either had to pay for the access, or brave the wilderness as a part of a party. Considering my financial situation was my biggest problem, the first was not an option. It was at one point, but I prioritized my research over it, which now lay in a corner of my library, gathering dust. </p><p>The second wasn’t exactly any better. There were only two groups that would accept a low-level Blacksmith, the absolute amateurs that would most likely die in the wilderness… </p><p>And, the exploration teams. </p><p>The experts pushed into the wilderness, searching for mines, new hunting spots, and even occasionally connecting with other towns. They had been critical in reestablishing the connection with the rest of the state after the Cataclysm, where even the geography had been reshaped, constantly penetrating through the wilderness. </p><p>Unfortunately, while they had achieved a lot, their death rate wasn’t too much lower than the amateur parties. They might be well-equipped professionals, but the dangers they faced were much higher. In the world after the Cataclysm, the unknown meant danger. </p><p>But, also, potential riches. A good discovery would mean an incredible payday, one that even my meager share as a Blacksmith would be measured in gold rather than silver. If I had enough gold, I could not only purchase everything I needed, but also afford to move to one of the new cities with the research organizations, getting one step closer to success. </p><p>I always avoided that, hoping to find myself a place that fit my skills rather than my [Skills], but maybe it was a mistake. </p><p>Maybe I had been too arrogant. </p><p>With a deep sigh, I stood up. It was time to make a change. </p>",

    "content": "<p>”Hey, Devon, I have your letter as well,” the postman said even as he walked through the workshop floor, passing around parcels and collecting coins as payment. “You have the payment, right?” </p><p>“Five silver. Right, Sam?” I asked, but his expression showed that it was not the case. </p><p>“No, the rates went up, now it’s six,” he said. </p><p>“Again?” I asked even as I dropped my hammer, a frown on my face. “It’s getting too much. How the hell we’re supposed to communicate with the other enclaves if it goes like this?” </p><p>He sighed even as he looked at me. “It can’t be helped, boy. Another outpost has fallen, so the letters from the coast have to be moved through another distant post. We’re not the only courier service that increased the cost.” </p><p>I reached my pouch and checked, but I knew what I would find. Five silver, and several coppers. I blushed even as I begged. I hated it, but the letter was too important. “How about you let me pay the old price. Say that you promised or something? I’ll pay you extra once —” </p><p>“Maybe you should stop, Devon,” Sam said with a sigh, his pitying tone hurting me worse than the time I smashed my hand with a hammer. “How many times it has been?” </p><p>“It’s different this time. I can feel it,” I answered. “I promised that I would work for free. With my education, they are getting a bargain. You know that…” But my confidence didn’t help as Sam passed me a letter, one that was too thin to be good news. </p><p>I checked the letter, only to throw it into the fires of my forge immediately. “Another rejection,” Sam asked. </p><p>I didn’t answer. I couldn’t. Not when he spoke in that kind tone, like I was a stupid child. I said nothing as I pulled my pouch and passed five silvers to him. What I was able to save after a month of working overtime. “I’ll find you next month. I have another admission prepared. I heard they were setting a new think-tank in the ruins of Cleveland.” </p><p>“Maybe you should stop working on the workshop and start going into dungeons. It has been three years, and you’re still not even level 10, and you know the walls of the town are hardly —” </p><p>“That’s enough Sam. I’m sure you have a lot of garbage to carry,” I cut him off sharply. I hated myself even as I said that. Sam was just trying to look out for me, one of the few people that even bothered to do so. He didn’t deserve my anger. </p><p>He wasn’t the one who refused to acknowledge my abilities because of a stupid fluke. </p><p>I hated his kind, understanding gaze even more. “See you around, Devon. Try not to kill yourself with your stubbornness.” </p><p>I sighed even as I grabbed my hammer once again, and pulled the red-hot sword from the flames. I smashed again and again, the way the sword trembled under my hands providing a good distraction. I had hated repairing stuff when I had first started, but after three years, it had turned into a hobby. A good way to keep my hands occupied while I focused on reworking the formulas. </p><p>But, today, I found it difficult to lose myself in the comforting world of math, not when I had to deal with another rejection. It hurt … though, it was the stupid reasoning of it that hurt. I would have accepted if it was just about my capabilities, rather than my Class.   </p><p>I had been rejected because I was a Blacksmith. A common class, one that didn’t even give a full range of Stats. Just Strength, Vitality, and Dexterity. </p><p>It was why I didn’t even bother reading the latest rejection letter more than a sentence, where they told me that my Class disqualified me from any kind of position in a think-tank. </p><p>Nothing else mattered. Not the fact that I had graduated college when I was sixteen, with double degrees in Math and Sociology. My doctorate in mathematical sociology didn’t matter, or the fact that I had been the leading name of my field before I even hit twenty-two. </p><p>Not when the Cataclysm hit, bringing the System along. Suddenly, no one cared about my groundbreaking papers that had the potential to reshape the socio-economical structure of the next century. </p><p>Just because I didn’t have Intelligence as a stat. Another sign of how our society degraded since the Cataclysm hit. Everyone chased bigger numbers to fight against the Cataclysm. A group of golden heroes, each identified by a mystic source of power and empowered through a convenient, easy-to-use interface, fighting heroically to stem the tide. </p><p>It was a wet dream of objectivist individualism that even Ayn Rand couldn’t comprehend.  </p><p>I slammed the hammer again, watching the sparks fill the room. Truthfully, I might have accepted my defeat with grace if Intelligence actually made people Intelligent. But, no, it did not, not any more than Charisma actually making people charismatic. </p><p>For the last three years, starting merely a week after the Cataclysm, I had interviewed almost a thousand people with Intelligence — sometimes openly, but mostly disguising as a conversation at the bar while plying them with drinks — until I had developed a solid understanding of how it worked. </p><p>It functioned more like a computer showed in someone’s mind. Perfect for finding the square root of six different ten-digit numbers before multiplying them in less than a second, or calculating the Pi to the ten-thousand digit immediately … but not helpful for actually working on the science behind it. </p><p>It was like hiring someone as a researcher just because they had their own expensive computer. Most of what they could do, I could easily replicate as long as I had a decent computer… Too bad the electronics didn’t work properly anymore, anything more fragile than a calculator had long fried during the initial days of Cataclysm, taking most of the infrastructure along with it. </p><p>“I just need an assistant with Intelligence, and I can still be useful,” I growled in frustration as I continued slamming, the usual lack of calm as I worked not helping. Still, even as my focus wavered, my [Repair] doing most of the work. </p><p>I paused when most of the surface work had been completed, touched the hilt, letting my sole perk [Analyze] do its work. </p><p>The inner structure of the sword flashed in a moment, showing me that there was still a subtle crack in its surface, one that would weaken the efficiency of its enchantment. How it would weaken, or why, I didn’t know. </p><p>However, unlike the other things, it wasn’t an impression that was fed back by [Repair], which didn’t include any magical repair knowledge, even if it was Level 24, almost about to get a second perk.</p><p>No, I learned that through repeated practice, even though I ruined several weapons in the process. Sharpness Enchantment was a simple one, just several lines of condensed mana, and it worked properly as long as I resolved the blockage. </p><p>I finished repairing it before I quenched the sword in mana water, another use of my [Analyze] confirming that it had been properly solved. </p><p>It was rare for someone to have a skill with such a high level, one benefit of the endless overtime I had pulled, trying to afford the ever-rising courier fees. </p><p>I sighed as I left my private forge room, and started walking toward the desk, carrying only one weapon. I frowned when I realized which supervisor was currently manning the desk. Mark. Not exactly my favorite person. “Only one weapon, again?” he asked with a nasty smirk. </p><p>“As usual, special order,” I said even as I put the weapon down. “The structural damage is repaired completely, and the enchantment should be working as usual.” </p><p>“Perfect. Let’s see how much money our resident genius deserves for it,” he replied with glee as he flipped open a book, and made a show of checking the numbers. “Wow, a whole sixty copper. You’re rich! I’m sure, this time you can buy that perk reset stone. I heard that the last one went for three gold.” </p><p>“Thank you for keeping an eye on me, Mark, I appreciate it,” I answered, trying to keep my voice cool. His nasty laugh showed that I wasn’t exactly successful. The fact that he was right only rankled me more. </p><p>As I walked back to my forge, I could see the others visiting the desk, and none of them carried less than five pieces of gear with them, despite the fact that none of them had their [Repair] as high as mine. All because, when Repair reached Level 10, I chose [Analyze] over [Efficient Repair], arrogant enough to plan forward how it would help me once I got a proper research job once the society started to recover. </p><p>Even if it didn’t, I assumed that the ability to repair enchanted weapons would allow me to make much more money. It looked like it would … until a dungeon nearby started to drop repair spells for mages. Just like that, the high-end repair market was gone. And, as the number of mages that could cast it continued to increase, even that was at risk. </p><p>I needed to reassign my perk. Something I could have achieved easily a year ago. That time, Perk Reset stones — the cheapest way of achieving it — went for about sixty silvers, while I was able to save almost ten silvers a week, which I wasted by hiring people to collect some data, arrogant enough to think that I was getting a head start for my job as a researcher. </p><p>Now, my [Repair] was almost Level 25, and once it reached there, the Perk Reset stone would turn useless, since it only worked on the last Perk received. </p><p>Improving skills got harder and harder, especially without renewed challenges, but even my most optimistic calculation — as a function of quality, work time, and a sudden exponential spike for the practice required to reach the next stage — suggested I had less than a month before I needed to purchase it. </p><p>Or I would get stuck with [Analyze] forever. </p><p>When I arrived at my private forge, instead of picking another weapon, I extinguished the fire, grabbed my hammer — the only thing I owned in the entire forge — and walked out of the workshop. </p><p>For once, I decided to cut the day short. </p><p>I had an important decision to make. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I didn’t linger in the capital for long. I stayed just enough to make sure Kartpa Valley disciples wouldn’t start a massacre in their frustration before walking away.</p><p>“That was … unexpected,” I muttered as I walked back, still trying to understand the sudden change. Just as things were getting good, things had transformed again. </p><p>At least, this time, it wasn’t a surprise attack from a cultivator I couldn’t defend. The way my initial Markas adventure had come to an end is still stuck in my mind. At least, this time, rather than running away and leaving them in potential danger, I managed to arrange a potentially very cushy position for Aisnam. </p><p>Assuming, of course, everything I had heard about sects valuing the cultivators was true. Still, since her family was somehow connected to Entsa Pavilion, Aisnam should have more knowledge about the way they operated. And, she agreed to go with them even after ‘her mysterious allies’ had shown great capability, including giving her access to hundreds of techniques. </p><p>I had no doubt that, even with my cheating, the sects could offer her more, at least in the short term. They could, for example, help her to reach the Foundation Establishment relatively easily, not to mention giving her access to one of their time-diluted mystic lands. </p><p> Her sudden disappearance was frustrating on a personal level. I was more than fond of Aisnam. She was smart, fun, and kind; and her unique brand of stress relief was certainly fun. Her sudden departure hit hard, even if it meant a great opportunity for her. It was like a girlfriend suddenly getting a promotion and traveling to another country. </p><p>However, as much as I was sad to see her go on a personal level, the same wasn’t true from a strategic perspective. Even with the System, the benefits she could provide me had dwindled. Yes, she could have helped me learn some more combat techniques, but that was more or less the limit. </p><p>I already had more than enough techniques for the Qi Gathering stage, so I didn’t need to recycle more. And, even if I tried to recycle them, it would be hard for her to gift another pile of techniques after the last time. And, the same trick wouldn’t have worked for Foundation Establishment techniques. She wouldn’t have passed me them. </p><p>Not because she would suddenly start acting stingy, but because she would care too much. A martial artist, trying to decipher a broken Foundation Establishment technique was a recipe for disaster, and any attempt to convince otherwise would either require me revealing my real cultivation, or find other extreme excuses, both with a chance to destroy the chance to trigger the System. </p><p>The same was true for the artifacts. Recycling a few damaged artifacts might have been possible, but that was the limit. No matter how rich or strong she got, she would only give me artifacts that could be usable by martial artists, which had significant inherent limitations. Talismans might have been useful … but with my ability to create formations, that was useless as well. </p><p>Even our unique method of harvesting Qi was significantly inferior when compared to letting random Foundation Establishment cultivators try to intimidate me to prove their inherent superiority. Nowhere near as fun … but still effective. </p><p>The only real loss was losing the chance to make some quick improvements on alchemy or artifact refining, the two paths I needed the most to make sure my abilities had no obvious gap. However, even that was dubious, because Aisnam clearly lacked talent on both. Finding another source of assistance would have probably worked much better. </p><p>“Then, there are the benefits,” I muttered as I continued walking, still trying to argue with myself that her sudden departure was a happy development. </p><p>The biggest benefit was that I regained my mobility. I would still try to protect the capital and her kingdom, but it was different than having one vulnerable target that was being observed by multiple groups. With Aisnam gone, so did the most obvious weakness of the Zaim Kingdom. With the cultivators restricting each other, all I needed was to create more Connate Realm martial artists, which I could do easily. </p><p>Then, there was the biggest benefit. Having potential access to the sect library. I didn’t know if Aisnam would ever return, but if she did, I might even convince her to bring me back as a servant. And, if I could visit a sect, I would finally have access to a market I could use freely. </p><p>Not to mention, the stronger she got, the higher the rewards would be. </p><p>“Still, that doesn’t make it any easier,” I muttered. Since my arrival, the connections I made were limited, but considering their fate, I felt reluctant to repeat them for now. </p><p>It started with Marana, who had been captured immediately by the Tiger Fist, which I wrote off as a coincidence. Then, I started to get close to Elsana and Lannayin, only for them to end up in the middle of a war, followed by their disappearance. I only knew that their disappearance had something to do with the sect. Aisnam got recruited hastily by the sect, while Pearyin…</p><p>Well, I still didn’t know what happened to Pearyin, and I was just hoping that she could return safely. </p><p>I still didn’t know if the weird variant of fate I was dealing with led me to connect with them, or if meeting with me somehow changed their destinies instead. Considering the capabilities of the System, both cases were possible. </p><p>“Too much trouble,” I muttered as I moved back to Markas, wanting to calm down a little. However, rather than using the flying boat or running, I chose to walk for a while. I had been running around, stressed, for a long while. </p><p>Calming down was what I needed. Maybe if I could walk uninterrupted for a few hours, I might actually relax enough to dispel the sudden depressive feeling that overwhelmed me. </p><p>“It was supposed to be easy,” I muttered. “Just like my System calls. Be a freeloader. Just hang around, suck a few benefits, and when things got hard, disappear. Just how hard it is.” </p><p>Unfortunately, I wasn’t self-deceptive enough not to know what was wrong. It was easy to be ignorant when I was weak. I felt no pressure about my decision when I escaped Markas the first time, knowing that they were facing a threat that I couldn’t even tickle. </p><p>Yet, the stronger I got, the more difficult for it to be an excuse. I could intervene more, and save people from unnecessary torture. I didn’t want to be a hero, but also, it was hard to refuse the chance to help people when they were right in front of me. </p><p>Unfortunately, helping people, at least at the scale I was thinking, was not easy. As a plan, using the system to get stronger and stronger until I could defeat the sects and save the mortals from their oppression sounded nice. </p><p>But, in practice, it was an impossible mess. I was never the most involved student, but even I knew nothing good came from it when one man with a strong idea of how the world should be forced the rest of the world to conform to that line. </p><p>I sighed. “Not like my attempts to help went smoothly either,” I muttered to myself. I tried to help Pearyin, only to somehow trigger an incursion from sects through a mortal war. For now, things were relatively civil, with most of the fighting done between Connate realm martial artists, but there was no guarantee that it wouldn’t turn more and more violent. </p><p> That Dao Gate was clearly a great treasure, and even its concealed side effects were enough for the sects to trigger a war. I had no idea what they would do if they realized it wasn’t the effect of an inferior mystic land. </p><p>Worse, not doing anything was not safe either, as shown by the last trip from the Kartpa Valley disciple, who sabotaged the stone door to replace it with a temporary alternative. I had no idea why he had done so, but it was clear neither Entsa Pavilion nor Aisnam was the target. At that time, Kartpa Valley’s victory seemed a given. </p><p>Meager as it was, evidence suggested that whatever plot they had, it was unrelated to the mess I had triggered. Or, if it was, it was only linked indirectly. </p><p>With a sigh, I summoned the flying boat, and decided to visit the nearby capitals, to see if our capital was the only one that was sabotaged. It would take a while, but it was the best way to start. Because, I had a feeling that, whatever was going on wasn’t going to be pretty…</p>",

    "content": "<p>The moment the dagger touched the ground, Aisnam stopped hiding her cultivation. Her gates flared with Qi, and she rushed forward with the full might of a ninth-stage Qi Gathering cultivator. It was necessary, as things would be far more difficult if her opponent started flying.</p><p>“You — you recovered,” her cousin gasped in surprise, but it wasn’t exactly fear. He raised his sword for a casual slash, forcing Aisnam to maintain distance. A mistake that Aisnam punished him readily. Thanks to our work, she read the clumsy attack easily, and dodged it by a hair’s breadth, delivering a punishing blow, using Verdant Palm, the technique she was the most competent at.</p><p>Her opponent flared his Qi to create a shield. It was a blunt move, one that was designed to leverage the great difference in raw power.</p><p>It was a mistake, not that he knew of. The difference in raw power was indeed great, allowing him to mobilize ten times more Qi than Aisnam easily. Unfortunately for him, I was able to control his gates, which meant, I could disorient his Qi flow.</p><p>It was a small manipulation, like a twitch of a muscle. But cultivation combat arts were delicate things. Just like a twitch of a muscle could ruin the life of an acrobat, it could ruin the delivery of a cultivation art.</p><p>My momentary blockade destabilized the Qi flow for the shield, which was enough to prevent it from appearing on time. Aisnam covered the distance with a burst of speed again, and delivered another palm strike. It was once again absorbed by the armor.</p><p>“Pathetic,” one of the Entsa Pavilion disciples commented. It wasn’t exactly an idle comment, considering she used her Qi to enhance her voice, making sure not only the other disciples heard it, but also the people of the city. “It seems that Kartpa Valley is getting more and more pathetic, their disciples unable to fight below their realm, only holding on due to their superior armor.”</p><p>Kartpa Valley disciples said nothing, but their dissatisfaction was clear in their expression even as they tried to hide it.</p><p>Disoriented by the attack, Aisnam’s cousin tried to retreat, but she didn’t give him a chance. She continued to attack his body repeatedly, slowly weakening his defenses. His head wasn’t protected by the armor, but whenever she tried to attack there, he was able to defend.</p><p>However, he wasn’t able to switch. After learning many cultivation techniques, I had long learned that very rarely, they fought in actual melee range, preferring to maintain a distance of several feet, using the reach of their techniques. The stronger the cultivator, the greater the engagement distance.</p><p>Aisnam deliberately reversed it, preventing him from using most of his techniques. Admittedly, it was not exactly a strategy without disadvantages. By locking herself to such a distance, she was also removing her biggest advantage. Most of her new techniques were useless at this distance, particularly against a superior cultivator.</p><p>Still, as I watched her, I couldn’t help but admire her determination. At this point, she could have retreated a few steps before attacking the new techniques she had learned. As I watched them, I could easily come up with hundreds of combinations that would deal with him. All it would take was for her to capitalize on her technique, and her life would be saved.</p><p>Yet, she was also smart enough to know that, if she revealed the possession of multiple techniques at once, all with significant expertise, it would be very suspicious, particularly with the learning aura in the land.</p><p>I had to admit, that her determination was incredible. I had fought against a Foundation Establishment cultivator from a great distance, and even with my cheats, the pressure he brought to me had been considerable. She must have been feeling even more from point-blank range, but she kept a cool head.</p><p>She limited herself to a combination of Verdant Palm, mixing with several martial arts strikes. I recognized some Forest Dance moves I had taught her. She used the combination against her cousin, pushing him into a more troubling situation.</p><p>Admittedly, my occasional attempts to disturb his attempts to build a Qi shield played a critical role … but then, she was holding back as well. As she fought, I could see her actually mixing a few martial arts techniques to the mix to limit her Qi consumption, relying on the raw strength brought by those techniques.</p><p>Martial arts techniques had no advantages in terms of explosive combat. Anything they could do, Qi cultivation could do better. But, there was one thing essence techniques held the advantage, and it was the endurance.</p><p>Ultimately, Aisnam’s Qi was limited. Under the constraints of her strategy, even all of her reserves wouldn’t have allowed her to take down her cousin. Yet, by mixing in essence techniques, she had extended her combat duration significantly.</p><p>Her cousin, unaware of that, forced himself to constantly reestablish his Qi shield. One successful attempt would have given him the necessary angle for victory. Unfortunately for him, Aisnam had no intention to do so, countering his every attempt to create some distance, regardless of the technique he used. He tried to alternate between fist, palm, and sword techniques, but all failed.</p><p>I couldn’t help but feel satisfied with the result. After all, not only Aisnam was able to counter his moves, but also she was able to disguise his failure as his own competence rather than her great skill with many techniques, allowing her to read every single attack he was able to deliver.</p><p>Just as I was about to injure one of his gates that lay near the point Aisnam chose to penetrate his armor, I noticed something peculiar. Aisnam’s palm strikes were gaining an ethereal quality. I failed to understand the source.</p><p>It wasn’t the level of her technique. Not only it would have arrived with an accompanying glow to mark her breakthrough, but also I would have recognized the type of improvement.</p><p>I would have suspected some kind of Qi transformation, but it didn’t only impact her Qi strikes, but also her martial arts abilities. But, clearly, it wasn’t just her martial arts abilities either.</p><p>It was just that, every hit was somehow … more.</p><p>Whatever it was, I decided that comprehending it in the middle of everything was not exactly the safest thing. I had decided to activate the formation I buried in her cousin, temporarily disabling two of his gates, enough to interrupt his defenses. Finally, Aisnam delivered a strong hit to his head. He fell down, disoriented.</p><p>As the battle turned, I looked at the Kartpa Valley disciples, ready to intervene if they decided to ruin the duel. It would be against their martial ethics, but considering their general callous attitude, I didn’t trust their honor.</p><p>I could see their disgust as their servant disciple lost, but they didn’t try to intervene. Whether it was about the presence of Entsa Pavilion disciples, or it showed just how little they cared about their servant disciples, either way, they showed little concern about the impending death of a Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p>“P-please, mercy. We are family —” he gasped, which was all he was able to say as Aisnam raised her palm once more.</p><p>“You should have thought of it before killing my brother,” she responded even as she attacked him with another palm. However, as she delivered that, a problem occurred. Not any sneak attack, or anything else that could actually harm Aisnam. I would have preferred it, because I had already put enough safeguards in place to save her.</p><p> No, the problem was bigger. Whatever effect that allowed her to deliver those hits with such accuracy haha suddenly intensified, allowing her attack to not only kill her cousin, but shatter the armor as well.</p><p>A shocked gasp from the Entsa Pavilion disciple confirmed whatever happened was a big deal. “Palm intent,” she gasped in shock even as she tightened her grip, and pulled a communication talisman.</p><p>The disciple of the Kartpa valley recognized what was going on almost immediately, and pulled one as well. Thanks to the formations I had, I was able to intercept their messages. Both of them were informing their nearest elder about Aisnam using Palm Intent.</p><p>Whatever it was, it was a very big deal.</p><p>I immediately intercepted both messages, but didn’t destroy them. The Entsa Pavilion disciples immediately moved forward, talismans in hand as they prepared to intercept, meanwhile, Kartpa Valley disciples moved back, ready for a fight.</p><p>I could see that the only thing that prevented them from attacking was the risk of turning it into a real war. Without it, Aisnam would be dead. </p><p>Luckily, Aisnam was still in the arena, the formation allowing me to communicate with her. “Should we extract you, or would you prefer to go with Entsa Pavilion? Make a fist if you want to be saved. Nod if you want to go with the Entsa Pavilion,” I said to her, my voice blocked from reaching the other disciples, acting like her mysterious allies.</p><p>As much as I wanted to save her, I knew that if I did so, she was likely to be hunted by two sects. It wasn’t a fate I wanted to force her.</p><p>After a moment, she subtly nodded, telling me that she wanted to leave with them. Understandable, considering just how much they seemed to value Palm Intent, especially when the alternative was potentially being hunted by the two strongest sects.</p><p>So, I stopped intercepting the message from the Entsa Pavilion. Merely a minute later, a luxurious flying ship arrived, and a Golden Core cultivator appeared. Before Aisnam could even say anything, she was pulled to the flying ship ….</p><p>Then, they were gone.</p>",

    "content": "<p>I wasn’t the only one moving toward the walls. Most of the citizens were gathered at the walls and rooftops, anxiously waiting for the fight that was about to happen. Not too far from the main gate, there was a giant stone platform, radiating Qi. </p><p>It was not there before. An artifact, just for the duels, I recognized. Aisnam’s cousin was waiting there, with a smug expression on his face, acting like his victory was guaranteed. Admittedly, it was not a bad assumption. </p><p>A wrong one, but it couldn’t be helped. </p><p>Unfortunately, the presence of the arena made the task of helping Aisnam harder. Not impossible, but harder. Unlike formations, I didn’t have any expertise relating to artifacts, meaning, just like the Qi shield around my own flying boat, I couldn’t manipulate the defenses around it easily. </p><p>But, that didn’t mean that I was helpless, particularly since I watched the formation expert fly away the moment he finished. Clearly, a fight between a Qi Gathering and a Foundation Establishment cultivator was beneath him. </p><p>The arena, with the Qi shield around it, created an excellent cover for me. I carefully created a formation underneath, one that functioned as a drill, slowly worming its way through the underside of the arena, glad that Aisnam was taking her time walking from the palace slowly, protected by her new guard legion. </p><p>My job was made easier by the fact that the arena was designed for Qi Gathering cultivators rather than Foundation Establishment ones — a difference I was able to detect easily thanks to my growing exposure. Just like the formations created by the expert, artifacts designed for the Foundation Establishment cultivators were, for the lack of a better word, denser. As a consequence, they required far more Qi to operate. </p><p>Thanks to that difference, not only I was able to create a hole under the arena platform, but also I covered the surface with a formation that blended with the arena, ready to intervene. Then, I waited. </p><p>Aisnam appeared at the city gate, walking toward it with a solemn attitude, carrying no weapon, and just wearing her mortal regalia instead, which was limited to a small crown and a fancy robe, enough to denote her identity without creating clutter. </p><p>“Hurry up, I already wasted enough time,” her cousin called smugly, using his sword to float. </p><p>“You were always impatient, cousin,” Aisnam answered. “Maybe it was why you sold yourself as a dog to be promoted.” </p><p>His face twisted even as he landed, grabbing the same sword he had been holding, and then slashed with his full power. He was quick to anger, but also stronger than the itinerant cultivator I had been dealing with. However, while he was stronger in terms of Qi output, his skills with the sword weren’t impressive. Merely Beginner, making the attack strong but clumsy. </p><p>The moment he slashed his sword, I did two things. First, I prepared to activate my formation to defend Aisnam in case none of the foundation establishment cultivators intervened. Second, used his distraction to stretch a line of Qi through the formation, carefully infecting his body. However, I didn’t do anything immediately, focusing on defending Aisnam. </p><p>I expected Entsa Pavilion disciples to intervene, but to my surprise, they watched the attack, not even bothering to hide their smiles. On the contrary, it was the Kartpa Valley disciples who intervened in panic. One of them punched, demolishing the sword attack easily. Meanwhile, the other floated to the arena. </p><p>“Are you stupid, or are you trying to ruin the plan?” he admonished angrily. </p><p>“B-but, he insulted —” he started, only for the other disciple to actually slap him. My eyes widened as I watched the show. I didn’t expect that there was such a great difference in status between the two disciples. Maybe my lover was more factual than I realized when she called him a dog. After all, while they were too far away from the others to be heard, the slap was still visible. </p><p>Not only he was humiliated, but he was humiliated in front of mortals. I knew enough about the cultivation world to know just how big of an insult it was for them. </p><p>“I don’t care. You have just one job. Wait until the official start of the duel, and kill her. It’s the whole reason the sect wasted a spot in the sacred realm for you. Otherwise, a servant like you does not even deserve a Foundation Establishment pill. Understood!” </p><p>He nodded as the other disciple flew away on his sword. Then, he turned to the civilians who had just watched his humiliation. “You all will pay,” he growled. He didn’t enhance his voice with Qi, but the formation allowed me to hear it. “Once I’m the king, I’ll kill every single one of you.” </p><p>With that, any hint of pity I might feel toward him vanished. He was certainly not the kind of person that needed to be allowed to rule others. While I didn’t think his sect would allow him to kill everyone in the city, I had no idea they wouldn’t care if he executed a few thousand people to appease his anger. </p><p>Aisnam didn’t seem to be particularly shocked by what happened, and continued to walk toward the arena in her pace. She didn’t bother goading him for another mistake, as it was clear he wouldn’t make the same mistake. </p><p>I used the time to slowly infect his body, and build a small formation inside him. It was a slow, delicate process, requiring minutes even with my skill level. Not to mention, it was only possible due to a combination of my advanced formation knowledge, helped by competency in several gate construction techniques. </p><p>The gate construction techniques allowed me to correctly assess the exact nature and the shape of his eight gates that were connected to his dantian. Still, I was lucky that he was merely in the first stage of Foundation Establishment, which meant only his dantian had been transformed, and his gates still maintained their Qi Gathering Realm shape. That way, I was able to create some obstructions over his gates that would go unnoticed until it was too late. </p><p>A timely blockage of his Qi was all I needed to give Aisnam an opportunity. </p><p>As I modified him, I also examined his dantian, which, unlike the rest of his body, had been transformed. Just like my prisoner, his immortal root had transformed, its tendrils spreading in his dantian, its ability to subdue Qi magnified significantly. It was the biggest difference between a Qi cultivator and a Foundation Establishment one. </p><p>However, before I could examine how the structure of the root differed between the two, Aisnam arrived. “I’m ready to make you pay for my brother’s death, cousin,” Aisnam declared, enhancing her voice with her Qi even as she raised her hands, taking the position for Verdant Palm technique, a technique that she had improved significantly. </p><p>“A Qi Cultivator, daring to challenge me,” he replied, giving a bitter laugh. “You’re lucky that I’m annoyed, cousin, or I would have spent hours torturing you. It’s your fortune that the time of esteemed outer disciples is too valuable to waste like that,” he replied, looking at them as if he were trying to apologize. </p><p>“A dog licking his masters to the end, cousin,” Aisnam said, fueling his anger even further. </p><p>“You asked for it,” he said, raising his sword again, but before he could attack, the Kartpa Valley disciple flared his Qi as a warning. </p><p>“Wait until the declaration of duel,” he warned before he turned to the disciples of Entsa Pavilion, who looked frustrated. “Would you do the honor and referee, or should I?” he asked. </p><p>“Go ahead,” the Entsa Pavilion disciple gestured, showing little interest in an actual duel, thinking that it was a foregone conclusion. </p><p>“Start when my dagger touches the ground,” Kartpa Valley disciple declared as he lazily let go of the weapon, treating a Profound Grade dagger as a toy. Aisnam tensed as the dagger fell down, and started gathering her Qi to her palm. It was stretching the rules a bit, but no one cared. </p><p>After all, she was a mere Qi Gathering cultivator. They didn’t expect her to do anything. It would take a miracle for her to even resist a Foundation Establishment cultivator, let alone defeat him. Especially since, from their perspective, she was still merely an injured cultivator, at the third stage. </p><p>Unfortunately for them, she had a lover very proficient in creating miracles.</p><p>Or cheating … but was there any difference between two other than the perspective… </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Come on, blondie, you can do it. Just three more rounds,” Astrid shouted even as she pointed at the target, and Lillian swung her sling … missing again. “You make a terrible hunter. How can you take down a prey if you can’t even hit a tree.”  </p><p>I just watched from a distance, not alerting them to my presence. I shook my head in amusement even as I watched them. When I left for another exploration trip to get a better sense of the slight threat that I could feel at the depths of the valley, Astrid had been rather skittish after watching another ... Mana transfer session. </p><p>Maybe because Lillian had been unnecessarily loud in an effort to convince her to peek, a ploy that had been successful. The last thing I heard before leaving was Lillian asking for her help training her aim. That felt weird at that time, knowing Astrid’s attitude toward the elemental magic, but I trusted Lillian to handle herself. She had a better handle on Astrid’s attitude in any case. </p><p>It seemed that I was right to trust her. Astrid looked far more comfortable, enough to mock Lillian openly. It was welcome progress. </p><p>Too bad my trip hadn’t been as fruitful. I had gone out for a trip for one reason only. I was able to feel an unsettling presence in the depths of the valley, one that actually triggered an unsettling feeling in my new set of instincts. I spent most of the day exploring the tracks around the valley, trying to get a sense of what it might be, but failed to find anything that could explain it. </p><p>As for moving deeper to explore it, I flat-out ignored it. The whole point of it was to check whether it meant some kind of immediate threat. Going deeper might give me a better idea of what that threat was … but then, it could also trigger it. </p><p>That was not an acceptable risk. Considering that, up until now, those instincts triggered nothing but rash aggression, even when I was facing a force of multiple mages, I decided to take that sense of caution seriously. </p><p>“Marcus, you’re back,” Lillian shouted as she saw me approach and put her new sling back to her belt and started running toward me. “Come on, defend me. Astrid had been bullying me all day.” </p><p>“I was not. I was just helping her train —” Astrid started, only for her words to be cut short when Lillian hugged me possessively, and started kissing me. Her anger might be fake, but her passion was certainly real. Astrid turned to the side, trying to avoid looking at us, but she wasn’t able to keep herself from glancing our way regardless. “Can’t you two wait until you’re not in front of me,” Astrid admonished. </p><p>I chuckled even without pulling from the kiss, and Lillian’s lips mirrored. After all, it wasn’t like doing so gave us any privacy. Once she pulled back, Lillian sent a smug glare toward Astrid. “It’s your fault for bullying me all day,” she said. </p><p>“It’s not my fault you’re a terrible hunter, even children have better aim than you,” Astrid replied, frustration making her tone more biting. </p><p>“It’s because you’re too demanding,” Lillian answered, and they started arguing, making Astrid more and more frustrated. Lillian looked frustrated as well, but she had been faking it. Deliberately triggering resentment was a weird path, but I decided to trust Lillian for now. </p><p>Watching them would have been amusing, but I had a more important objective. Trying to control my transformation. The whole day, I hadn’t pushed myself even once, yet I had three more scales on my forearm. At this point, it was covering almost half of my forearm. Worse, it was speeding up. </p><p>I closed my eyes, meditating just like Astrid had taught me, spreading my consciousness inward, just like I did to control my mana or develop my elemental cores. This time, however, I ignored my damaged cores and focused on my arm. The last night, the meditation was about getting familiar with the process. </p><p>This time, it was about control. According to Astrid’s teachings, the initial method of feeding the vitae required channeling the mana directly to the transformed part. That way, the transformed parts slowly strengthened and generated more vitae, and the remnant mana would grant some kind of control. </p><p>Repeat enough times, and the holy warrior would slowly develop a rudimentary control over his transformation. According to Astrid, it was a process that took years, but most of it was about teaching them how to channel their mana actively, something that was not a problem for me. </p><p>Instead, I grabbed the smallest amount of mana I could control, and channeled it to a targeted portion of the scales, pushing directly to it … only for it to be devoured immediately, like desert sand devouring water. </p><p>Disappointing, but not surprising. It was just as I expected. </p><p>Most of Astrid’s explanation had been about how to control the amount of mana that was fed to the essence of the immaculate beasts, as flooding with too much mana could easily destroy the nascent, developing vitae. </p><p>Unfortunately, my situation was different enough for it not to matter. The fact that my scales absorbed all the mana at once wasn’t surprising. I didn’t know the attributes of a dragon heart, but fragile didn’t belong to that list. </p><p>I could flood one of the scales with all the mana I could channel to test its limit, but I was afraid of the results. It would quicken the transformation even further … and what if there was no limit. </p><p>“No, let’s try something different,” I muttered as I channeled another minuscule bit of mana, and brought toward the scales. I let the mana touch the edge, but when the scale started to devour the mana, I didn’t let it go. Instead, I pulled it back forcefully, turning that into a tug of war. </p><p>The mana snapped. </p><p>“Promising,” I muttered, but I kept my eyes closed. I gathered my mana once more, this time not touching the scale, and instead let it linger at the edge, trying to resonate with the scales without touching, trying to resonate. </p><p>It had been somewhat more successful. As I spent my time, trying to extend connection while trying to treat the scales the same as my other vitae, I could feel some kind of connection. It was a weak connection, like trying to speak to someone in a raging storm, someone who spoke an utterly foreign language. Further interaction was impossible. </p><p>Still, I smiled. It might be useless for practical purposes for the moment, but it was still the greatest progress I had made. And, it was just the first day. </p><p>Magic was not easy to master, especially when dealing with a condition like mine, which, by all accounts, should have been an unmitigated disaster. </p><p>I stayed like that for an hour, trying to expand the connection. Unfortunately, I failed to expand the condition no matter how hard I worked. </p><p>It was time for another experiment, trying to replicate the foreign instincts. Anger was the easiest method to achieve that, and luckily, I didn’t have any particular trouble getting angry. I just needed to imagine my uncle and start dreaming about how I would rip my uncle into two for betraying my grandfather. </p><p>My heartbeat quickened under my revenge fantasies, and along with it, the amount of mana in my body. Still, it didn’t reach the critical density that would forcefully infuse my body, so I ignored that plight for the moment, and instead, repeated the indirect mana resonance. </p><p>It was hard to simultaneously meditate and revel in my anger, another thing I was able to achieve thanks to my unique brand of training. The connection was still as flimsy, and the background noise was still a raging tempest, but to extend the metaphor, we were speaking the same language. It was a spotty understanding, merely a few words. </p><p>But it was much better than before. </p><p>Even with my eyes closed, I could feel the scales on my arm disappearing one by one, turning back to smooth skin. However, with each disappearing scale, holding it back became more difficult. I was sweating under pressure, like I was carrying an enormous weight. </p><p>I took a deep breath and hissed, wondering just how long I could hold it. I would have tried that as well, if it wasn’t for hearing footsteps closing in. With my enhanced hearing, it was easy to detect the different footsteps. Lillian walked with the confident yet alluring gait of a noblewoman, each step showing the truth of her heritage. </p><p>Unfortunately, while that way of walking both looked good and conveyed confidence, it wasn’t exactly the ideal for wilderness, making a lot of noise. I would have noticed her even without my enhanced hearing. </p><p>Astrid, on the other hand, was able to move like a whisper, making her much harder to notice. With her approach, I decided not to test how much I could hold the transformation back. </p><p>And, the moment I let it go, the scales grew back almost instantly … and along with it, came pain. It wasn’t the worst I had ever felt, but with the life I lived, that was not a simple option. It certainly hurt more than a mere stabbing. </p><p>A loud gasp exploded despite my greatest effort to stay silent. </p>",

    "content": "<p>After an intensive crash course on the magic of Germanic tribes that took most of the afternoon, Astrid walked away to cook dinner, leaving me alone to ponder about the lesson. </p><p>I had made great progress, mostly because there were a lot of common aspects when it came to elemental magic and shifter magic, at least for the first-order, which was the beginner phase. A successful first-order mage requires only two things. The successful transfer of vitae to their body, and channel the mana to feed it. </p><p>However, I didn’t alert Astrid about the extent of my improvement. If I told her that, I would need to tell her about the reason, including my past — and uncertain future — as an elemental mage, including the fact that I still had four elemental cores. Damaged, maybe, but still elemental cores. </p><p>No, that wasn’t a conversation I wanted to have immediately. Her hopes of turning me into a holy warrior made her very open, and I didn’t want to jeopardize that. </p><p>Instead, I focused on cataloging the information I had collected, and comparing it with the elemental arts. </p><p>Vitae transfer was simple in both cases. Take a small piece of developed vitae — formed by the spells of another mage in the case of elemental mages — and inject it into the body of the target. </p><p>Mana channeling wasn’t as simple. </p><p>Without some expensive medicine and other external aids, even the ability to feel the environmental mana required years to develop. Back when I had been learning, it took me six months despite not using anything. My grandfather had refused to use any of the common medicines, instead choosing to train me — or torture me and disguise it as training. </p><p>Of course, only years later, I had learned that using external medicines left most mages weak when it came to sensing and manipulating mana. There was a reason I hated and loved that crazy old man in equal measure. Even with all the pain, he forged me into something more than a disposable dabbler of magic. </p><p>I shook my head, dispelling those thoughts, and focusing on the differences in magic. </p><p>While the first-order state of both traditions was similar, just feeding the vitae with mana slowly but steadily. The first real difference started with the breakthrough of the second-order. For shapeshifters, it was a smooth transition, letting the growing vitae slowly spread to their body and let it bond with the parts of their body, letting it awaken in any part of their body, before feeding to spread. </p><p>Once spread, the vitae had turned into a part of the body completely, with no chance of reversal.</p><p>Trying to do the same would have been a death sentence. At first-order, the vitae was not a part of the elemental mage. Reaching the second-order requires the opposite, gathering the vitae into one impenetrable core, and isolating it. </p><p>From there, it required the mage to slowly and carefully feed it with magic, and let it grow while trying to imprint the cores with their own understanding of elements, turning vitae into something that aligned with our body … and more importantly, our mind. </p><p>Hurrying up to that stage didn’t have a pretty end. Elements were not merciful. </p><p>As for the third-stage, the elemental mage finally lets vitae spread into their body, but even then, it is something aligned, but separate from the body, a distinct layer. Even at that stage, it was possible to flush out the elemental vitae completely and start from the beginning. </p><p>Meanwhile, for the shapeshifters, the third-order by represented by their whole body bonding with the external vitae, an inevitable transformation. It wasn’t exactly something I was happy to hear. Transforming back to human didn’t mean the vitae was gone, or even contained in one central location like elemental core. </p><p>It wasn’t good news. It meant, that even if I perfected the art of shapeshifting, it meant that I was only able to get rid of its external markers, and not solve the problems behind it. </p><p>“One step at a time,” I muttered, not letting that realization discourage me. As long as I learned how to reverse the direction, it would be enough. </p><p>Assuming, of course, I could actually do it. As I sat next to a rock, leaning with my eyes closed, I was failing to make even the smallest difference. Astrid had long gone to bed, and Lillian walked to me. “How’s it going?” she asked. </p><p>“Not as well as I hoped,” I said as I opened my eyes. </p><p>“Anything I can do to help,” she said. </p><p>“No,” I replied. “It’s just that the way they treat their vitae is different. It’s supposed to be something violent, something to be contained and herded, or it can easily destroy us. Even at its gentlest, it still needs to be seized, channeled.” </p><p>“Elemental vitae is not that bad,” Lillian said. </p><p>“It is, compared to the way they use it,” I answered. “Instead of fighting and controlling, they are embracing the vitae, letting it spread to every part of their body. There’s no reversal.” </p><p>Lillian frowned. “Does it mean that her assistance is not useful?” </p><p>“No, I didn’t say that,” I replied. “Even if it couldn’t change the situation, it should be able to grant the ability to remove the external markers. That’s the most critical aspect. The rest … we could see once things calm down and they stop searching for us.” </p><p>“Maybe they already did?” Lillian offered.</p><p>“Maybe, but are you willing to risk it?” Her lack of an answer was enough to answer in itself. “But that’s enough studying for the night. Now, it’s my turn to be the master.” Lillian gave a saucy smirk. I chuckled. “Unfortunately, I’m being more literal than you hope. We’re going to work on your magic.” </p><p>“There’s nothing wrong with my magic,” she said defensively. </p><p>“On the contrary, there is a lot wrong with your magic. Even before your rapid increase in power destroyed your control, you were having trouble with explosive displays. And, now, it’s even worse. You take too long to gather your mana, and when you release, it’s not steady.” </p><p>“I don’t think it’s that bad.”</p><p>“Follow me, and we’ll see,” I said and brought her some distance from the camp so as not to wake Astrid up. She was doing well controlling her distaste for elemental magic, but I didn’t want to take a needless risk. That, and she was tired after the day she had, more mentally than physically, and there was no point waking her up. </p><p>Once we were sufficiently away from the camp, and near a small hole filled with water, I pointed a rock at a distance. “Why don’t you attack that rock. Three sequential attacks, identical, and as tall as your palm,” I said, giving her a simple exercise. She raised her hand, her face twisted with focus. </p><p>She waved her hand, pulling some water from the nearest source, before she formed three identical water blades. They flew one after another, each landing a target. “See, perfectly delivered,” she said smugly. </p><p>It wasn’t perfect. While the water blades were of similar height, the differences were still noticeable. However, that only covered the real problem.  </p><p>“No,\" I said. \"Come with me.” I walked toward the rock we picked as a target, with three fresh indents. “Look at them, do you see a difference?” </p><p>“No, they are all at the same size,” she said with a frown. </p><p>I ignored the voice in my head, one that sounded grouchy and stiff, telling me that those weren’t as tall. There was a fraction of an inch difference between the tallest and shorter. A difference that my grandfather would have never accepted and demanded perfection. </p><p>Unfortunately, that wasn’t the only difference between the three. And, unlike the fraction of difference based on the height, it was more important. “Look at their depths, the first attack created an indent twice as deep as the second, while the third attack barely left a mark.” </p><p>That made her blush. “I just focused on the height like you asked,” she said. </p><p>“I also said identical.” </p><p>“Alright. I will show you,” she said with a renewed competitiveness. We went back to our spot, and she delivered three more attacks, but when she delivered the third one, she was frowning. She didn’t need me pointing to realize she failed. “Again,” she muttered as she launched another trio of attacks. Then, again…</p><p>Only after dozens of attempts, she was able to achieve something close to success, and even then, she took almost fifteen seconds between each attack to perfect her attack. Hardly something that could be copied. “It’s harder than I expected,” she admitted. </p><p>“I know, that’s why I offered to train you,” I said. “We need to work on your control. Hold a blob of water in her hand, and start alternating it between turning it into a disc and a sphere.” </p><p>“Easy,” she said after a few repeats. </p><p>“Of course it is,” I replied even as I leaned down, and grabbed a broken stick. “True. Now, why don’t you try again while trying to dodge this stick,” and swung toward her. Well, swung was an exaggeration. I gently brought it toward her, giving her plenty of time to dodge. She ducked under it, but not without losing control of her water, which turned shapeless. </p><p>“What was that?” she asked. </p><p>“I need you to be able to cast spells without stopping channeling your mana,” I said. </p><p>“Is this the kind of training your grandfather made you do?” she asked. </p><p>“No,” I said with an amused chuckle. “If it was my grandfather, you would have been on a rope, trying to balance yourself. More importantly, he wouldn’t have held back.” </p><p>Her eyes widened. “That’s barbaric.” </p><p>I shrugged. I didn’t want to waste my time defending him, particularly since she was right. While I benefited a lot from his training, I had no intention of subjecting someone else to the same treatment. “Maybe. But we still have to work. We don’t know when we have to fight again,” I said. </p><p>That was followed by an hour of intense training, where we alternated between practicing her attack and control exercises. We only stopped when she was out of mana and exhausted. </p><p>“It was exhausting,” she said, then smirked as she grabbed my shirt. “Since you depleted your mana, take responsibility, and replenish it.” </p><p>My smirk matched hers. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Astrid froze under my touch at the mention of the Tree of Life, her reaction implying that it was a big secret. “Sorry, I missed the last part. What were you saying?” I said. </p><p>It wasn’t a good excuse, and it was clear that Astrid didn’t buy it even for a second. Still, no matter how much I hated the general patterns of the noble life, one of their principles was certainly true. </p><p>Maintaining a false facade was better than an honest conversation. </p><p>“Ah … I was talking about whether you wanted to learn more about shapeshifters,” Astrid said, the fact that she used Roman terminology showing just how anxious she was to change the topic. I nodded and led her to a nearby rock where we could comfortably sit. </p><p>“I have already talked about the basics, and two methods of creating a holy warrior,” Astrid started. </p><p>“Yes, living vitae, and solidified, dead vitae,” I said, wondering which one was more relevant to mine. Considering the crystal state of the dragon heart, I wanted to believe that it was the second, but I doubted it. “Why don’t you start talking about the dead vitae,” I still asked. There was no harm in learning about both. </p><p>Things would have been much easier if I could just tell about the dragon heart, but I didn’t feel any more comfortable than her talking about the Tree of Life. The only difference was that I was more careful keeping secrets. </p><p>Or, at least, I wanted to believe I was. </p><p>“There’s not much application to your situation, but there’s no harm being through,” Astrid admitted. “As I said, implanting the dead vitae is the simpler of the two, but it doesn’t mean it’s not dangerous. Once an immaculate beast dies, their vitae solidifies. Then, a priestess extracts it, cleanses it through several rituals, and carefully grafts it to the skin of the warrior.” </p><p>“Why skin, and not the flesh?” I asked. </p><p>“Because we don’t want the blood to spread the vitae around, of course,” she said with a chuckle. “That’s a slow and painful way of executing someone.” I chuckled at her as well, but mine was considerably more nervous. “In any case, the solidified vitae transforms its immediate surroundings. It’s a painful process, but when it ends, it grants the holy warrior the abilities of an immaculate beast. The warriors usually replace their legs or arms, though there are exceptions, it doesn’t end well.” </p><p>“How about with the living vitae?” I asked. </p><p>“The method is essentially the opposite. The vitae has to be drawn from a third-order beast, and it could only be transferred by blood. Then, it’s injected into the warrior, one drop at a time, allowing him to adapt the essence slowly.” </p><p>“And, when you say slowly?” </p><p>“Years,” she answered. “It takes a lot of time for a warrior to align correctly with the beast essence. It’s a highly spiritual journey. They live with the beast, hunt together, and do their best to embody their aura. Only by aligning to their perspective, they could handle the essence.” </p><p>“That must mean that they start to embody the instincts of the beasts as well, right?” I asked. </p><p>She chuckled, shaking her head. “Don’t worry, your lack of instincts is understandable. That’s not how it works. In both cases, instincts don’t transfer. That’s why they have to live together with the beast to learn how to control the essence. Only when the essence is not prepared correctly that’s a problem.” </p><p>“Does it mean that there’s a solution?” </p><p>Astrid wore a sad expression. “No. When such a mistake happens, the candidate inevitably goes mad. A quick execution is the most merciful method.” </p><p>“Glad that it’s not my problem,” I chuckled, using a lifetime of experience to conceal my fear. Luckily, Astrid was too distracted by her own concerns to actually pay attention to it. “As I said, I wasn’t exactly conscious of the essence transfer but —” </p><p>“Don’t worry about it,” she said. “Just give me your arm and let me diagnose you.” </p><p>I decided to extend my arm. I was confident that, with my control over my internal mana, I could detect the direction of her probe, and retreat it even if I couldn’t block it. She put her hand over my scales, and I felt her magic over mine. Her magic was interesting, surprisingly close to pure mana, though more orderly and obedient. </p><p>Feeling her magic, I could understand her reason to define elemental magic as cursed better. Once transformed, the elemental magic was hard to control and even harder to contain; a rabid animal compared to a docile, well-trained pet. </p><p>Still, I kept moving the pure mana inside me moving and churning, ready to block if her probe extended further. However, she stayed true to her promise, and her magic had been limited to the scales and the immediate surroundings. </p><p>“Just as I suspected,” she said. “Whoever responsible for your plight had used living essence, but not much of it.” </p><p>Her explanation told me that I managed to hide the truth of my transformation from her. “Any idea which beast,” I asked. </p><p>“No. Some kind of a snake, but that’s all I can say,” she replied, then smiled. “Still, it’s excellent news. While they clearly used more essence than any sane person should do to initiate the transformation, you clearly survived and thrived. You just need to get a handle on the techniques, and you can slowly spread the transformation across your whole body.” </p><p>With her explanation, I managed to get a rough sense of my situation. Assuming that dragon heart was some kind of solidified vitae — even if it wasn’t, it functioned reasonably similar — it was clearly not exactly dead, but in some kind of deep slumber. </p><p>Following that, my desperate breakthrough attempt by mixing four elemental vitae had managed to awaken whatever imprint of instinct was captured in its crystal depths, but only partially. Maybe it even liquified a minuscule portion of it at that time, or maybe it was slowly dissolving into a living essence. </p><p>Either way, since it was lodged deep into my heart, spreading through my blood was just a natural conclusion. </p><p>Then, there was the part of the instincts, one aspect I didn’t dare to reveal yet. Her declaration about their fate had a sense of finality, and I wasn’t ready to see if she was willing to make an exception for me. </p><p>I had no intention of dying pathetically. Even if I concluded that death was inevitable, I would first go back to Britannia, and make sure my precious uncle accompanied my grandfather to the underworld. </p><p>As for what to learn from her first, it was easy. “I prefer to learn how to reverse it first,” I replied. She looked surprised at my choice. I pointed at my scales. “The ones responsible for it are not happy that I managed to escape, and searching for me. I would feel much safer if I could hide myself from them.” </p><p>“That’s reasonable, but it’ll be much harder for you to reverse it once you start. The true essence is easier to spread than contain. Usually, holy warriors slowly transform themselves completely, and only when their transformation is complete, they learn how to regain their human form.” </p><p>“But, it’s possible,” I asked. </p><p>“Yes, but at the cost of wasting the true essence of the immaculate beasts,” she said reluctantly. “Once a warrior does something like that, sometimes they find they can’t reverse the transformation, and require more essence to trigger the transformation again.” </p><p>“Believe me, that’s not an end I fear,” I replied. </p><p>Her eyes widened. “How can you say that,” she gasped, shocked. “Becoming a holy warrior is a great opportunity, and not just because of our belief. Even without transforming, they are stronger and faster. They heal faster, and live longer.  Once they transformed they can even contend against the cursed sorcerers of Rome. Why do you think that Rome could never dislodge us from our true home?” </p><p>The true answer was Rome liked fighting with itself too much to put a proper focus on expanding, a situation that turned particularly exaggerated since Eastern Rome had declared its independence and established the Empire a century ago. Otherwise, even if their so-called holy warriors were strong, they couldn’t keep back a determined Rome. </p><p>Fighting against a sorcerer was impressive, but what if that sorcerer was a part of the legion, with a cohort fully dedicated to his defense... But, I just nodded rather than confronting her about it. While I enjoyed discussing military tactics, it wasn’t the time.  </p><p>Instead, I made her an offer. “Alright, I’ll try to complete the transformation first, but only if you teach both the method of expansion and reversal.” </p><p>It looked like a sacrifice, but it was not. As long as the crystal stayed lodged in my heart, the last thing I would struggle to continue to transform.
