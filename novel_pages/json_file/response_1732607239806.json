    "content": "<p>I expected Naomi to surrender quickly. </p><p>Deepthroating was not a simple activity, especially for someone with almost no experience — her only experience was during the short stint when I pushed her against the bathroom door, just before the encounter with Sarah started. </p><p>And, Sarah’s merciless push was much harder than my measured push, her vindictive nature, combined with her relative inexperience, making her push her friend quite a bit more than it was reasonable against a newcomer. </p><p>So, I was surprised and impressed when Naomi managed to stay down without a complaint even as her beautiful gasps and gags filled the room. </p><p>And I wasn’t the only one. </p><p>I glanced at Sarah as she pushed down her friend’s head, only to see shock dominating her gaze, erasing the amused satisfaction was carrying just moments ago. Yet, failing to get what she had been working for, she pushed even more, showing she could be really merciless when feeling competitive. </p><p>Especially since she had been on the exact same trick the last night — with an encore in the kitchen in the morning — and knew just how challenging it was to be on the receiving side. </p><p>Yet, despite her intimate knowledge, she reacted to Naomi’s success more aggressively than she had been subject to. “I guess it’s not too bad for warm-up,” she said, though, despite her light tone, her expression was tense. “You can still surrender before the main event comes. Just tap his leg, and I’ll let you retreat.” </p><p>Naomi growled, somehow managing to reflect some anger despite the impediment lodged deep into her beautiful throat. I was impressed by her performance. More importantly, her hands stayed on the side, deliberate in their avoidance of my legs, doing her best not to give Sarah any excuse. </p><p>I had really underestimated her competitiveness, though I started to wonder whether she was pushing herself too much and sound would react negatively, or her dedication was actually solid.</p><p>Luckily, I wasn’t the one that was responsible for testing her convictions. That responsibility was gleefully assumed by one of her best friends, who was more qualified to catch the signs of discomfort and understand whether she was pushing too hard. </p><p>Though, checking her serious expression, I wasn’t feeling entirely confident about her decision. </p><p>“If that’s what you wish,” Sarah growled even as she pulled back for a moment, then put both hands on Naomi’s head. A growl escaped her mouth as she pushed down, showing her determination as if she was the one that was about to stretch her throat for the work. “I’ll teach you how to give a proper … kiss.” </p><p>I barely held back a laugh as she corrected her words to avoid vulgarity at the last moment, creating a beautiful contrast with her position.</p><p>Even when forcing a friend to deepthroat me, she was unable to swear. How cute. </p><p> Naomi didn’t react to her words, too busy plunging down my shaft, her tits squashing against my thighs. Though, her success was not easily attained, spit dribbling down her lips as Sarah pushed, making my shaft nice and shiny. </p><p>Not that my shaft was visible most of the time, with Sarah pushing Naomi down aggressively without giving her a break. Naomi’s hands clamped on my thighs hard enough to leave a mark, showing that her success didn’t come freely. Yet, as Sarah pushed down my cock further into her throat, she managed to keep her teeth away from my skin as she continued slobbering. </p><p>It was a wonderful performance. </p><p>She gagged, she gasped, she cried, all muffled with my shaft, but she kept her eyes shut obediently as Sarah pushed her down more and more, with a performance that surprised Sarah as her lips stretched to the limit.</p><p>“How was your first proper attempt?” Sarah said as she finally let Naomi come off, though despite trying to sound confident, I was able to catch the tone of discomfort in her tone, realizing that she had pushed her friend in the heat of the moment. </p><p>And that was certainly not undeserved, I thought even as I watched Naomi rose, coughing and wheezing like she had just run a hundred-meter sprint while holding her breath. </p><p>Sarah reacted quickly, holding her shoulder as she rubbed her back, doing her best to assist her breathing, guilt apparent on her face. Guilt melted like snow under the summer sun the moment Naomi spoke. </p><p>“And you told me it was hard to handle,” Naomi said, smugness radiating off her despite the repeated coughs. “You’re clearly not as good as you think you are if that gave you any trouble.” </p><p>Sarah just glared at her in frustration, no doubt regretting the mercy she displayed. “It’s because I helped you. Let me show you how it’s done without cheating.” </p><p>With that, she leaned forward, her beautiful lips already wide as her mouth slid down my shaft, taking the slippery path created by her friend. After a few repeats, she started pushing her head down further and further, while her hands clamped on my legs hard to generate leverage. </p><p>I couldn’t help but look at the developments with a fascinated gaze, their ridiculous competition pushing them to things I could have struggled for weeks to even make them give a try. </p><p>Naomi’s beautiful brown eyes grew with a speed that reflected her alarmed state as she watched Sarah’s amazing show — a show that was even more impressive than the one Sarah had displayed in the morning, where she had been watched by a hidden sexy blonde. </p><p>“What can I say,” I said to Naomi even as I smirked. “She’s really decisive.” My words worked to create a miracle, making Sarah pick even more speed, while Naomi looked at me, unable to hide her annoyance. “I can’t lie, she’s really putting the work,” I continued, which hardly helped Naomi’s jealousy, but saying anything else would have doused the fire burning in Sarah.</p><p>Which would have been a real tragedy after all the work she put in. </p><p>Luckily, words weren’t the only weapon in my arsenal to help her with that spark of jealousy. Before she could move away, my hand snapped to her shoulder, pulling her close. A convenient lean later, my lips were around her nipple, my tongue already out. </p><p>“W-wait—“ she gasped, surprised, though considering what she had been doing earlier, it was clearly about the suddenness of the move rather than it touching a limit. The way her back arched, and the moan interrupting her words were more than enough to show just how much she enjoyed my little surprise. </p><p>Even as Sarah’s beautiful lips continued to bob around my girth, I turned my attention to Naomi’s tight body. While my lips were occupied with her breasts, my hands were still free. One of them stayed on her breasts, helping my dedicated assault on her soft globes… </p><p>… the other dipped down until my fingers found her wetness, dancing at the entrance to give her moans a new layer of passion, her cries mixing with Sarah’s gags and grunts. </p><p>I was afraid that Sarah would pull back to comment on my distraction, but, luckily, she stayed in place, determined to show off her superiority in her selected task. </p><p>It was a prudent decision, because, considering Naomi’s performance her first time, she was clearly going to be an impressive competitor for her going forward. Combined, the show they put on was enough to leave Carrie behind — which would have been sad if my blonde goddess didn’t have her own areas of excellence to distinguish herself from the rest of her friends. </p><p>I focused on the present, enjoying the feeling of Naomi’s silky skin over my lips while Sarah continued her job. Even when she pulled back for a breather, she didn’t say anything, reacting only with a gasp before going down again, her lips tight around my girth. </p><p>That certainly earned a reward, I decided even as I pulled my hand away from Naomi’s tits, and gathered Sarah’s hair, tight enough to earn a beautiful squeal. Her lips widened as I assisted her to go down even more, until her nose pressed against my skin. </p><p>It was enough to clog her breathing completely, yet Sarah worked wonders, obediently swallowing my shaft as her tightness taught me a new meaning of bliss. </p><p>Meanwhile, my fingers were teaching Naomi the same question. Each passing second pushed her closer to a climax as her inexperienced senses learned a new meaning of pleasure under the combined assault of my fingers and my lips. </p><p>“Delicious,” I murmured as I pulled back to breathe, only for Naomi to tremble with the sign of an upcoming explosion. “So, princess, tell me. Are you ready for it?” </p><p>“Yes!” Naomi gasped even as she grabbed my hand, her soft fingers pulling my hair even harder than I was pulling Sarah’s, forcing my lips back to her chest. </p><p>Who was I to disappoint such a beautiful goddess, I decided even as I leaned down, capturing her nipples once more while my fingers continued dancing at her entrance, caressing her knob and spreading her wetness. </p><p>Sarah continued to choke herself on my shaft steadily, my crown imprisoned in the depths of her throat. The deep-throating continued, pushing my endurance to the limit, making it a race between me and Naomi about who would lose first. </p><p>Unsurprisingly, Naomi lost first. The climax hit her hard, awakening a range of melodic cries as she collapsed against the couch, trembling next to us, her legs parted beautifully to give her gushing core, her chocolate skin shining with an excellent sheen. </p><p>It was a wondrous sight, though I didn’t have the luxury of enjoying it for long. </p><p>Not with Sarah trying to monopolize my attention. </p><p>Naomi’s delicious moans gave Sarah a renewed sense of passion as she pushed herself down, even more, her throat tight around my girth. And, when she showed one last burst of explosive effort, managing to sink even deeper for a time. My shaft started to twitch before exploding, filling her beautiful mouth to the brim. </p><p>“That’s how it’s done,” Sarah murmured in satisfaction, even as her lips were stained with my seed, marking her failure to take all of it. “Do you think you can handle it without assistance?” </p><p>“O-of course I can handle it,” Naomi answered, her blush beautiful. </p><p>“Really, do you even know how it tastes,” Sarah grinned, amused by Naomi’s sudden freezing. </p><p>I intervened before Naomi could reply. “Don’t be rude,” I said to Sarah even as I slapped her ass softly. “Your friend might not have the opportunity, but it’s your friend, and I’m sure she’s curious. Why don’t you give her a kiss to share the taste.” I paused for a moment, letting Sarah process the suggestion. “Unless you can’t handle it, of course.” </p><p>“O-of course I can handle it,” she managed to answer without stammering as she looked at Naomi. “But I’m not sure if she can handle it,” she answered. </p><p>“I … I can handle anything you can handle,” Naomi answered. </p><p>“Oh, really?” Sarah answered even as she put her hands on my thigh for support before pulling herself up my lap, clearly determined to test Naomi’s works.</p>",

    "content": "<p>In the end, despite the difficult nature of the moment, it didn’t take long for me to finally came to a decision. </p><p>Ultimately, for all her faults, Isolde was a true warrior, and not the useless kind Empire tended to produce through their process of raising knights. And, as a true warrior, she would never take anyone that she could best seriously. </p><p>However, she had a rather excessive prejudice against magic, which impaired her decision-making. For example, even with the little focus I put on their internal party affairs while I was still on my throne, I knew that she didn’t have the calmest time in their little adventure party, not that it was surprising with the magic-heavy nature of it. Lancelot’s martial abilities were the only reason she stayed at that party — the same guy who had just betrayed her. </p><p>I had plenty of reasons to dislike Lancelot, but it was hard to argue about his skill with the sword. I had never seen someone as good as him. In a fair martial duel, he would take me down easily. </p><p>Of course, that only assumed a fair duel with nothing but swords. I was not in a habit of seeking such ‘fair’ duels, as they were nothing more than pointless entertainment for the nobles who were still under the misconception that battles were won with heroism rather than tactics. </p><p>Yet, Isolde was an interesting one. She was certainly not one of those obsessed with honor and fair combat — her archery specialization despite its reputation more than enough to show — yet she dismissed mages. </p><p>And, even now, behind her anger, I could see that dismissive glint, suggesting that she just saw me as another cheater mage. </p><p>I might have been annoyed if it didn’t give me a chance to change her mind. </p><p>“What would you do if you get free?” I asked. </p><p>“I’ll kill you first, then that blond bastard, of course,” Isolde growled, her answer beautifully uncomplicated. </p><p>I chuckled. “Do you think you can even succeed in the first part? Rather confident, considering you guys had to gather an army to take me down in the first place.” </p><p>Isolde smiled, though it was the smile of a lioness about to pounce. “From this distance, definitely,” she answered, her smirk getting wider. “You don’t have any fancy wards to protect yourself, and no time to cast a spell. If it wasn’t for those bars…” </p><p>“You’re confident. Too bad that you wouldn’t dare to bet on the fact,” I said as I smirked widely, goading her to make a decision. </p><p>“Who said I wouldn’t dare!” she shouted without even hearing my words. </p><p>“Okay, let’s bet then. I’ll free you, and if you win, I’ll let you tie me up and bring me back to the Queen, finally proving that you’re much better than the others.” She smiled at the suggestion, welcoming the opportunity to finally prove that she was better than the mages in their little group. </p><p>“Open the cell, then,” she said. </p><p>“And don’t you want to learn what’s the punishment when you lose?” I asked. </p><p>“No need,” she answered. “You can ask me anything if you win, it’s not like you’re going to win.” </p><p>I couldn’t help but shook my head in amusement even as I looked at her face. She had always been hotheaded, but before, she was never hotheaded enough to make such a wide promise — I promise that I knew she would follow because of her honor obsession. </p><p>Being locked in prison certainly didn’t help her. </p><p>“As you wish,” I said as I removed my sword and shield and put them on the corner, leaning against a wall — though as I put them, I carefully linked them to the wards of the prison using the Tether, to make sure no one could burst in even if they decided to make a visit. </p><p>“What are you doing?” she asked. </p><p>“Removing any chance of you complaining it’s not a fair fight,” I answered as I turned back to her, seemingly unarmed. I still had the Tether of the Underworld wrapped around my forearm to help me establish wards quickly if needed, but since Isolde lacked the magical understanding to notice it, I kept it in place. </p><p>After all, I was trying to look fair, not actually be fair. </p><p>Then, I unlocked her prison door. </p><p>Isolde lashed forward immediately like an arrow launched from a longbow, fast, sharp, and merciless. Unfortunately for her, it also made her predictable. </p><p>I waited until her fist was about to connect, then put my hand on her wrist, pushing slightly, just enough to unbalance her. And, as she took a step forward, I slapped her ass. It wasn’t just to anger her, but also to cast a subtle spell on her to drain her energy. It would drain her slowly, just enough for her to assume it was the after-effects of the prison. “Careful, sweetie,” I said. </p><p>“I’ll kill you,” she growled angrily and charged again, her kick as sharp as a knife. This time, I took a step back, dodging it easily. She lashed in a chain of kicks, which stretched her pants to show the beautiful tightness of her legs. </p><p> To her credit, she didn’t suddenly start accusing me of being a coward just because I wasn’t stupid enough to take her kicks and had the temerity to dodge. It sounded stupid, but a great number of knights — and significantly more than a few dark warriors — had used that exact argument just because I didn’t stay still and take their preferred assault method. </p><p>For all her faults, Isolde really had the soul of a deadly assassin, only held back by a lack of patience and an excess of morals. </p><p>Maybe I could fix that once I managed to earn her cooperation. After all, for all the achievements, she had been suffering from a huge identity crisis as her skills left her unprepared for the next stage of her life filled with politics, and I doubted the betrayal of Lancelot, one that she trusted and hoped to be together, helped her to calm down any. </p><p>She kicked again, this time, rather than dodging, I grabbed her pant leg and pulled, which had two great effects. One, it unbalanced her again, forcing her to take a few steps back hurriedly to avoid a counterattack. </p><p>Second, it ripped her pants all the way through its seams on the side, creating an impromptu slit. Admittedly, I cheated a bit by using a simple spell to rip it that way, but…</p><p>A Dark Lord didn’t deserve his name if he didn’t cheat occasionally. </p><p>Isolde didn’t react that much until half a minute later, when I stopped another attack of her by grabbing the hem of her shirt and pulling it off, this time hard enough to rip it off completely at the cost of receiving a painful punch to my ribs, hurting badly even with her magical exhaustion weakening her. </p><p>“I’ll kill you,” she growled as she realized it wasn’t accidental, but I didn’t miss one very important detail. Her anger was too shallow, too forced, and the blush on her face showed she felt self-conscious about her nudity. This was understandable, as, under her shirt, she didn’t have a bra but tight bindings, suggesting that her breasts were rather more impressive than I had first guessed. </p><p>Yet, despite her threat, when she attacked again, her attacks were much more slower and careful, trying not to get too close, her moves hesitant, reminding me of the hesitation she had displayed during our bargain when she had first shown my full erection from a close range, hidden only by the ruined boxers. </p><p>Her absolute lack of sexual experience was showing… </p><p>Yet, her sudden careful assault only made it easier for me to grab her pant legs when one of her kicks overextended, allowing me to rip it off, leaving the task of hiding her tight ass to her panties. Unfortunately, her panties were the ugly kind, which allowed her to hide more of her beautiful hips than I would have liked. </p><p>Yet, it was clearly more than she would have liked, if her blush was any indicator. </p><p>Her shame wasn’t enough to actually prevent her from attacking, though after repeated failures, she started to accept that her assumption about my martial abilities might have been mistaken. “You’re … strong,” she admitted when she pulled back to take a breath. “Why are you bothering with magic when you’re this skilled. If you focused on the path of the blade instead…” </p><p>I didn’t answer, just smirked, amused by the way she started to accept her defeat even before I landed a punch on her body. Admittedly, that was the point, in melee combat, attacking was always easier than defending — at least the absolute kind that I was displaying — which proved that I was inarguably better than her. </p><p>As an added benefit, it left her beautiful body pristine, without the slightest mark.</p><p>Then, she tensed, a determined expression invading her face before she charged forward. This time, it was a reckless assault, one that paid no attention to defense. Ironically, the reckless nature of her attack showed that she accepted my martial superiority. Such a reckless assault gave me many chances to counterattack and take her down. </p><p>Yet, I chose the harder path, defending her without the slightest intent of counterattacking. Luckily, I had been cheating greatly, allowing me to dominate her martially in a way I couldn’t do in a fair fight.  </p><p>The reason, I could see growing wetness in her core. The more she proved inferior to me in martial abilities, the wetter her panties were getting. It turned out that I failed to understand the true depth of her martial obsession. </p><p>No wonder she was obsessed with Lancelot. </p><p>Unfortunately for him, he was just too passive to leverage that. I, on the other hand, had no problem pushing her seduction to the next stage. I let her fist connect slightly, with an angle that was more of a push than a punch, one that had disastrous consequences for my shirt. It opened, showing my muscles, a sight that earned Isolde’s appreciative gaze, enough to make her stagger for a moment. </p><p>It was an opportunity I didn’t miss, finally deciding to attack. She gasped I tackled her, but it was more from panic than pain, as I didn’t really push myself to the limit. </p><p>Yet, even holding back, I managed to leverage her momentary distraction to lock her against the wall, her wrists in my grip as I spread them, informing her about the result with great glee. </p><p>“You lose.” </p>",

    "content": "<p>I couldn’t help but look at the mages that were closing in, my gaze on the weapons in their hand, each radiating with a distinct magical aura that showed that they were much stronger than the mages they were currently holding. </p><p>Their armament was excessive, even by the lavish standards the secret base had displayed. Yet, their unique nature suggested they were not crafted here, and kept there to be protected — and probably as a part of the experimentation going on here — rather than being a part of the default armament. </p><p>They were being used only due to the emergency nature of my assault. </p><p>If they charged forward recklessly, I would have no chance to defeat them. With the ability they showed deflecting my magic, it would have been a challenging battle even if I had full access to my magic, though I was confident I would be victorious. </p><p>Without my magic, and without an ability to move, it was much different. </p><p>I was only alive, because they were moving forward slowly, careful to defend themselves. Even then, four of them spread in a half-circle, ready to defend the fifth who was going toward the case that held the dragon hearts. </p><p>They were clearly afraid of another spell, but they should be able to see that I was not in a position to react. “It’s the loyalty treatment, it makes it much harder to show initiative,” she explained. </p><p>“Oh, really,” I said as I looked at their spread, trying to suppress my instincts that begged me to push forward and kill the fifth before he could achieve his objective and complete their formation with dragon hearts, using their lack of initiative as a benefit. Yet, that was not possible, not without suffering the backlash from my core. </p><p>Their lack of initiative and adaptation was a good way to distract them, but the pain radiating from my core suggested that any attempt to cast a spell might cost me even more. </p><p>I was glad that they didn’t try to send another warning, because I was not in a condition to using the ward to block that. If I tried that, the backlash would have been spectacular. </p><p>As I thought of a way to handle it, they started to get closer and closer, ready to deliver a deadly assault, highlighting a need to distract them, especially since the fifth member of their little troupe still going toward the platform that held the dragon hearts — through his slow, careful walk as he raised his spear high, ready to deflect, gave me the time I needed to come up with a plan. </p><p>I considered sending another lightning bolt, giving the excuse to pull back, but I was afraid that the weakness of it would embolden them even more. </p><p>Meanwhile, the unfamiliar feeling of foreign magic on my skin distracted me even more. I was certainly not happy to give a healing expert unrestricted access to my body, but I didn’t have a better option at the moment. </p><p>“How long,” I whispered, using a little sliver of magic to prevent others from hearing, a little cantrip like that still in my capabilities despite all the pain and distraction. </p><p>“Fifteen seconds, at a minimum,” she said, which might as well be an eternity in terms of deadly combat, with the disparity that we were facing. </p><p>I decided to bet on their lack of adaptation. </p><p>I slammed my foot on the floor, forcibly creating a large sword, the kind that Germanic berserkers used, overwhelming in its presence, and let my magic on the surface, the lightning crackling along its length. </p><p>It was a domineering view, looking impressive enough to hold against their weapons. Too bad it was just an empty trick. The sword itself was made from rock from the floor, and with the minuscule amount of energy I was able to put on it, it was barely harder than cotton. The lightning on the surface was equally weak, a little trick to give a visual impression that would remind them of the lightning bolts that killed several of their numbers. </p><p>Though, in their defense, their hesitant step back was not entirely due to their lack of adaptation. There was a reason that the lightning element had an infamous reputation for mages despite its potential. It was almost impossible to control, which meant, without the advantages I had, replicating that controlled lightning trick would have expanded a significant amount of mana. </p><p>Combined with their ability, it was not too shocking to enable that. </p><p>I waved the sword threateningly, leaving a white trail behind, and they took another step back. Meanwhile, their fifth member managed to reach the platform. He grabbed five dragon hearts — the smallest ones, I noticed — and moved back toward his allies, who had been watching my intimidating show carefully. </p><p>I loathed to give them the opportunity, but intimidating them to stay away for that ten seconds was all I could afford, still waiting five seconds to fulfill. Barely more than a long breath, but under the circumstances, also the difference between life and death. No matter how intimidating my sword was, they would act after taking the dragon hearts.</p><p>I needed something special to shock them, to leverage their lack of adaptability perfectly.  </p><p>“Try to continue the treatment despite the shock,” I said to my ally, warning her before I grabbed her arm and pulled her in front of me, and pressed my lips against hers. </p><p>Her eyes widened as my tongue slipped in, exploring her mouth, but luckily, I could feel her magic still dancing inside me. </p><p>It was a ridiculous move to do in combat. So ridiculous that my opponents failed to react completely, their faces frozen as it clashed with their brainwashing. </p><p>Meanwhile, I Pity that the moment was too tense to properly enjoy the body of the exotic beauty pressing against me. I continued kissing her, each second recovering my magic even more. Soon, five seconds came and pass, yet I continued kissing her, giving her even more time to fix my state.  </p><p>Unfortunately, even with the brainwashing, they wouldn’t stay like that forever. Soon, they were raising their arms, ready to cast spells empowered by the power of dragon heart, making them even more intimidating. </p><p>Without a warning, I threw my sword at them, triggering an explosion before it could reach its target. </p><p>It was a showy move, but yet again, it was little more than sleight of hand. The flash that went off was nothing, not even enough to rob them of their sight for more than a second or two, and the pieces of the sword that flew around were nothing more than loose piles of sand and small rocks. </p><p>Times like that reputation was most important. Even if their brainwashing didn’t allow them to feel fear, they had just watched me killing half of their compatriots in a single spell, and that was after cutting through their ward — one that was designed to defend against another sorcerer for a decent amount of time — in less than a second. </p><p>With the weight of such a moment, their reaction of pulling back as a group, casting a strong shield around them, was the only logical option. </p><p>Too bad for them that it gave my reluctant — and blushing — ally a chance to further her progress even more. I felt her magic pulling back while I turned toward my enemies, finally with enough magic to resist. Yet, with them properly armed and in a defensive posture, there was no benefit of attacking immediately. </p><p>So, I decided to use the opportunity to take revenge a little revenge on my ally for forcing me here. Rather than pulling back, I used my empty hands to cup her ass and gave a strong squeeze. “Impressive,” I said as I felt the texture. Her ass was small, but despite its size, was surprisingly tight. </p><p>“You’re good to go,” she growled in anger as she pulled back. </p><p>“Try to delay the reinforcements as much as you can manage,” I said to her, not expecting her to resist against that many soldiers, supported by the mages that were still outside due to the unique nature of her mana, lacking the potency of a normal sorcerer to fight against such masses. Yet, delaying them was still an option. “And, maybe we can continue where we left off once we finish it,” I added, unable to resist the temptation. </p><p>Just because I was about to die didn’t mean I would miss the opportunity to flirt with exotic beauty. </p><p>She didn’t appreciate that statement, her anger flashing. Yet, her anger didn’t prevent her from explaining it further. “I’ll do my best. Try to keep your magic use limited, and more importantly, don’t use any lightning,” she warned, though, despite the speed she turned away, she wasn’t able to turn back with the necessary speed. </p><p>“Let’s do it, boys,” I said as I turned to the five that were behind the shield, whose expressions suggested the extent they were tricked, showing signs of anger despite their brainwashing. </p><p>While they processed their anger, I looked around, hoping to find a weapon. Normally, one sorcerer against five mages should have been a gone conclusion with no suspense. Unfortunately, with my ability to use magic limited and theirs enhanced by the dragon hearts they were holding, things were not that simple. </p><p>My restriction to use lightning made it even worse. </p><p>I noticed several weapons sprawled on the ground, their container had been destroyed by my latest spell — or more likely the defensive strategy my enemies used. </p><p> They were several weapons on the ground, some glowing with ever greater potency than the ones my opponents were using, but I didn’t try to summon them. The weapons of that caliber always came with several layers of protection. </p><p>Yet, before I could turn my attention to the more ordinary kind of weapons used by the ones that fell under my attack, I noticed a spear huddled in a corner. </p><p>A flash of shock passed through my brain! </p><p>It was the Spear of Scipio, a weapon that I was intensely familiar with endless sparring sessions that it had been used against me, wielded by my grandfather until his death.</p><p>Yet, it was here, hanging on the wall rather than staying back at my family estate... </p><p>“Like I needed more reason to go back and kill you, uncle,” I growled in anger, my fury rising... </p>",

    "content": "<p>“She’s a bit of a slave driver, isn’t she?” I said as I turned my smirk toward Megan, but I didn’t bother keeping my voice down. “Should I be afraid of our date?” </p><p>“You should definitely be if you don’t start moving,” Kim ordered from the side, yet, despite her sharp tone, a fleeting smile was on her face.  </p><p>“What a taskmaster,” I murmured, which earned an amused glare from Megan. “Oh, man. It’s such a big chore,” I murmured even as I hooked my arm around Megan’s waist, pulling her against my chest. The pressure on her breasts was very pleasant. </p><p>The camera started to take our pictures. Yet, Megan clearly didn’t appreciate my flippant tone, another growl left her lips, and for a moment, I thought that I had pushed her too much. Yet, she stayed silent as my fingers started dancing on her back. </p><p>A minute later, Kim commented. “Not bad, but give me something more impressive. Maybe a kiss. </p><p>“Good idea, but I don’t think Megan could handle that. We don’t want her following me like a puppy once we break up—“ I started, only Megan’s fingers to dig into my shoulder. While I considered whether I pushed too far even with the assistance of my Traits, Megan had already grabbed my chin… </p><p>And pulled me into a searing kiss. </p><p>My eyes widened as her tongue slipped inside. Ironically, the movement of her tongue was sharp and aggressive, suggesting that, yes, she had been annoyed by my action, but not as much as canceling her plans. That didn’t mean that she was unaffected, as the movement of her tongue suggested that she wanted to dominate me as a payback — maybe even leaving me on the edge as we finish our little game as she did the last time in her car after the lap dance. </p><p>Such a vindictive blonde. </p><p>Admittedly, her attitude was hardly a deal-breaker for me, especially with her legs wrapping around my waist, pressing our bodies even tighter while her tongue ravaged my mouth. </p><p>I wasn’t the one that cared about the audience, but the constant clicks of a huge, professional camera as Kim walked on the edge of the pool, working to record our show, was enough to give me a hint of self-consciousness. If it wasn’t for the tangible benefits in the form of Heroic Traits I might receive as a result, I might even balk at the prospect. </p><p>Even with that, I was tense. </p><p>Then, Megan’s tongue slipped even deeper, working wonders to make me ignore the sexy redhead doing her best to record our display. My tongue joined the fray as I retaliated against her aggression, with no intention of accepting her claim for dominance easily.</p><p>I didn’t want a repeat of our car adventure.  </p><p>Since her legs were around my waist, keeping her in place, my hands were free to wander on her body. After some dance, they landed on her hips, giving her ass a hard squeeze, enough to leave a small yet lingering mark. </p><p>A gasp of pain left her mouth. “Careful!” she warned, her expression cross. “You’re going to leave a mark.” </p><p>“Isn’t it better,” I answered shamelessly even as I squeezed her ass again, earning another small yelp. “Some bruises would help you sell the story even more. Isn’t this right, Kim?” I asked. </p><p>“Definitely,” Kim answered, her smile getting wider as she enjoyed her friend’s predicament. </p><p>“Assholes,” Megan murmured, though, despite her tone, a distinctive blush slowly spread her face, showing she wasn’t as unaffected as my little additions as she wanted us to think. Her quickened breathing, pushing her barely covered breasts forward was just another evidence of her mood. </p><p>Excellent. </p><p>She leaned for another kiss, and my hands returned their mission to squeeze and caress her ass, the combined assault of my tongue and my fingers working wonders, especially with my Seduction Trait enhanced my instincts for timing and teasing. </p><p>With that improvement, even the idea of her staying completely unaffected by our passionate kiss would have been insulting. </p><p>As our battle continued, my tongue soon took the dominant position. Megan was clearly split about how to feel about that. On one hand, her fingers were digging into my shoulders, wordlessly threatening me to pull back. Yet, on the other hand, her hips started to rock, which, considering our bodies were only separated by our swimwear, represented a considerable source of pleasure. </p><p>When she pulled back for another breather, she was gasping desperately. While she was catching her breath, I caught Kim’s gaze for a moment, only to see Megan wasn’t the only one starting to feel hot and bothered. I could see signs of a blush creeping up her beautiful neck, though her face was covered with her camera. </p><p>She might be aroused, but she continued to take our photos with absolute seriousness despite what her body might be feeling. She was taking her job seriously more than I expected. </p><p>Yet, as I looked at her, she lowered her camera momentarily, revealing her face was blushing as well. Catching my gaze, she winked at me before speaking in a serious voice. “Try to look a bit sexier, Megan.”  </p><p>“What do you mean, try to look sexier,” Megan answered as she turned to her friend, insulted by the insinuation that she might not actually be alluring. Yet, even as she looked at her friend, her hips continued to rock, testing my willpower. “Who do you think you’re speaking to?” </p><p>“No need to act out, honey,” Kim answered, Megan’s aggressive retaliation only making her smile bigger. “Everyone knows that you’re beautiful, but the passion is not coming out properly on the camera. You need to work harder. Give me something that would look good on the camera.” </p><p>“How?” Megan asked. “I’m doing my best, it’s not my fault that I’m dealing with the equivalent of a boring statue.” </p><p>I was tempted to answer her personal attack, but since it was a scuffle between friends, I decided to stay silent even with the occasional pot-shot I received in the process. “There’s no problem in your chemistry, sweetie. You look good on the camera. The problem is that, even with the attraction between you two, it looks dull on the camera. We can’t sell the story of a secret recording like this. I need more.” </p><p>“And what do you propose?” Megan murmured, looking at her friend suspiciously. “Should we try a different pose?”  </p><p>“No, we need something simpler. Your top needs to go,” Kim offered. </p><p>“No,” Megan countered immediately. “I’m not going to put my tits for everyone to ogle. Having a topless picture on the net would damage my prospects significantly.”</p><p>“I know how the business works, sweetie, and it’s not what I’m saying. You don’t have to show your tits to the camera. I can’t take a direct shot of them with that hunk’s chest on the way. Of course, if you want that bitch to win and ruin everything…” </p><p>Megan closed her eyes as she considered her words, but her legs, tensing around my body, gave a much better indication of her action, even before her hand sneaked toward her back. </p><p>Since I was a gentleman, I decided to help her. “Let me get it,” I whispered with a chuckle as I reached the little knot that was keeping her top in place, and tugged it off. It came off with surprising ease, leaving her almost completely naked, though the existence of her bottom, barely more than a collection of strings only counted as a technicality. </p><p>Pity I wasn’t able to catch a good glimpse of the show, but considering she had prevented me from getting a good view by pressing her chest against mine, it wasn’t exactly a big loss. The feeling of her naked breast was more than enough to compensate for it. </p><p>“Let’s continue,” I said as I pressed my lips against her, one hand massaging her ass, the other dancing on her naked back, the lack of a top allowing a smooth journey. A smoothness that I rarely experienced, in a way I could easily recognize as the assistance of the Traits, a feeling I had experienced in many different areas, from Intimidation to Pattern Recognition. </p><p>Yet, regardless of the source, my fingers danced over her back, triggering her pleasure enough to make her tongue stagger in my mouth, drowning in pleasure.  </p><p>However, even as her lips staggered, her hips started to move faster. </p><p>Her little photoshoot was getting more and more interesting… </p>",

    "content": "<p>I couldn’t help but smirk despite the pain as I realized I had been beaten black and blue by the same woman that had been moaning under the steady assault of my fingers after trying to get me drunk just hours ago. </p><p>The fact that her display of anger following her obedience in the morning gave an even more beautiful angle to it, especially since it suggested that the reason for her absurd reaction was less about the physical aspects of our adventure, and more about making my payback for her composure, thoroughly destroyed. </p><p>Of course, I had no evidence for the last aspect, but after the great number of encounters I had shared with several strong ladies with similar powerful backgrounds, I trusted my instincts to identify the exact nature of her feminine fury. </p><p>Pity that the sudden realization didn’t prevent me from rolling to the side, panicked as she charged toward me, no doubt not appreciating the slowness I displayed as I stood up, still leaning against the wall to make it look like I was exhausted. </p><p>This time, I had been — mostly — successful in dodging despite the limits I was trying to display, because this time, her charge was deliberately slow, giving me the time to roll away. Yet, even as I got away, she continued to swing her weapon with her full strength. </p><p>Her staff hit the wall with a great crash, leaving a big crack in the wall despite all the enchantments woven into the structure to prevent that exact outcome. </p><p>“Maybe we should take a break for a health potion if you’re going to swing your stick that hard,” I said, pushing an expression of fear to my face as I looked at the dent it left, the presence enough to break some of the enchantments through brute force.  </p><p>Someone was really angry about their earlier defeat. </p><p>“If you are not man enough to handle my strength,” she said, followed by spitting on the floor, showing just how little she thought about me. </p><p>Admittedly, her attitude would have made me furious if it was the full extent of my capabilities she was insulting. Even now, it earned another big notch in the column that was keeping track of her eventual punishment. “Hey, don’t insult my manhood,” I fake-growled as I raised my hand, and a gesture later, one of the healing potions floated toward me. </p><p>I gulped it down. Its power started to stir — a particularly unpleasant mixture of fire and numbness — through my body, ready to cure my body. Their greater potential wasn’t the only reason that people preferred healers over healing potions. The nasty after-effect it left was certainly a part of it. </p><p>I turned my magic inward, making sure there was no surprise addition to the healing potion. </p><p>[+143 HP] </p><p>There was no surprise hidden, showing me that not-Delia was determined to teach me a direct lesson rather than relying on trickery, confidence that her new skills. </p><p>Though, just because the healing potion was clean didn’t mean the mana I gathered to check its content had nothing to do. Their short shelf life and their relatively limited impact compared to the healing spells wasn’t the only reason for their rare usage.  They also carried a lot of little impurities that could build up unless destroyed, though destroying them without any damage required a significant precision that most healers lacked. </p><p>[-9 Mana]</p><p>“Why shouldn’t I?” she answered as I processed the healing potion, her smirk getting wider as she fell under the impression that she had gained the upper hand on our little competition.</p><p>An impression I was about to destroy with great enthusiasm.  </p><p>“Because I’m exhausted,” I said, my smirk getting wider. “You can blame your slutty friend if you want to blame someone. She really exhausted me during breakfast. She’s truly insatiable, always asking for more—“ I started, only to be interrupted as I threw myself to the side once more, forcing myself to avoid a thrown staff, one that buried itself on the wall. </p><p>My eyes widened in shock, this time genuine. Her move wasn’t really dangerous for me. </p><p>For the fake level and capability I had been displaying, however…</p><p>“Come on, sweetie,” I said as I rolled away, creating a ward around me, just in time to intercept her kick, one that held back her attack. “Just because your friend has loose morals doesn’t mean you have the right to treat me with such aggression.”  </p><p>[-291 Mana]</p><p>That hardly helped her anger, delivering several rapid kicks that drained the strength of the ward significantly — even though I cheated by casting the ward with a robustness that my fake identity shouldn’t be able to display. </p><p>Luckily, the same anger prevented her from noticing that little detail, especially with the current skill configuration she had been sporting. </p><p>A chill suddenly hit me, though, this time, it was less about her sudden fit of anger, and more about her complete lack of ability to recognize the irregularity in my shield. She was a living example of just how much I had been depending on the System for power. </p><p>I needed to cut my dependency on my skills, and there was no better time to do that than now. As she swung her fist against the shield once more, I roused my mana and blocked my own skill temporarily — choosing elemental magic as my target. </p><p>Then, I tried to hit her back with a gust of wind to push her back, trying to force a distance between us. </p><p>[-218 Mana]</p><p>Using that much mana for a non-aggressive spell, especially with my stats strengthening the assault, was supposed to slam her against the wall hard enough to leave her silhouette on the wall. Instead, she took a few steps back, giving me just enough time to reinforce the shield I created. </p><p>The limited effect of the spell was interesting, especially since I still had a great understanding of how to cast complicated elemental spells. That part of my understanding hadn’t been destroyed, yet I failed to cast the spell successfully. </p><p>It was like knowing the best way of traveling, optimal stops, the ideal pace, and the danger zones… Yet, if the ability to take a step disappeared immediately, all that knowledge went to waste, useless to apply. </p><p>I loosened the block, testing the rush of instinctual understanding that filled the gaps. With my Intelligence and Wisdom allowing me to pin the difference, I was able to identify several critical aspects. </p><p>And the rushing figure of not-Delia, ready to deliver another punch, was a perfect driver to learn. “You can’t even cast your spell properly,” she smirked violently as her fist connected with my ward once more.   </p><p>The loss of instinctual learning was scary, I decided as I repeated the same wind trick after I blocked the skill once more.</p><p>[-196 Mana]</p><p>This time, I was happy to note that the distance between us almost increased to five steps despite her preparation and slightly lesser mana spending. “How about this,” I said with a smirk. “Much better, right? Maybe you’re not as scary as you thought you are.” </p><p>“Really?” she growled as she moved forward, attacking once more. We fell into a weird pattern, sometimes letting her attacks succeed, giving her satisfaction of making me hurt, sometimes deflecting her attacks. </p><p>[-2849 Mana]</p><p>[-619 HP]</p><p>However, after five minutes and a great amount of mana expenditure later, I was able to cast the wind spell with a satisfying proficiency. It was still below — if barely — the expertise I displayed when I had first completed the basic level of the skill, and that was with the great difference in the stats between the two periods. </p><p>Yet, the speed of learning I was able to achieve during the process was impressive, even if it came with wasting enough mana to kill her more than twice. </p><p>“That’s enough sparring,” I said after a while, doing my best to look exhausted in the process. With my regeneration, I had already recovered most of the mana I had expanded, but we were reaching a point that, even with her current lack of magical ability to accurately assess my spells, it was getting suspicious. </p><p>I let the shield fall, only to receive a surprise kick that sent me flying. </p><p>[-85 HP]</p><p>The kick was a surprise not because I lacked the ability to react. With my reflexes, her skills weren’t advanced enough to prevent me from reading her moves even if she pushed herself to the limit. And, with her perceived success of beating me earlier, she wasn’t even pushing her skills to the limit in the first place. </p><p>Yet, I let that connect, because it was an excellent excuse to push back. “I see, you’re willing to play it like that despite the consequences.” </p><p>“What consequences?” she said, a vindictive laugh exploding against the walls. “There’s nothing you can do I can’t handle.”  </p><p>Unfortunately for her, my smirk was no less vicious. “As you wish,” I said. “You can tell Delia that you have ruined the cooperation that she had worked so hard to earn.” </p><p>The speed with her satisfaction melted away, replaced by a shocked expression, was a work of art. “W-what do you mean?” she gasped. </p><p>“I mean that our cooperation is over, completely. Not only I won’t help your princess in that mission, but also I’m going to stop working on the project. Have fun explaining that to Delia.” </p><p>“W-wait,” she gasped, her eyes wide. “You can’t do that!” </p><p>“And you’re going to ensure that, how?” I asked, enjoying the panic that was exploding on her face. And even better, with all of her skills geared for combat, she had no hope of reading that, or understanding the nature of my bluff. </p><p> “But…” she said, trying to find an argument, one that failed as I turned my back and started walking away. “Please,” she gasped. “I can apologize.” </p><p>I had to hide my smirk as she reached for the clasps of the leather armor she was wearing, panicked enough to reach the same solution that had secured my cooperation earlier, about to deliver the same thing that enraged her in the first place. </p><p>And, it would be a lie to say that I was not tempted to get that immediately, teaching her about the best way to take revenge. Unfortunately, that conflicted with my desire to resolve the mystery that surrounded them — especially since I didn’t dare to poke around in their residence, afraid of more surprises. </p><p>Luckily, there was a way to resolve both problems simultaneously. “Not like this,” I said with a shrug and continued walking, enjoying her surprise. “I’m going to take the rest of the day off, and tomorrow morning, I’m going to visit Delia for another breakfast. Either you be there as well, and both of you apologize, properly, or I stop working with the princess.” </p><p>I didn’t ask that just because I wanted a fun threesome where both girls worked hard to earn my forgiveness. It was just a nice bonus. I wanted someone else other than not-Delia to visit, so that I could work on deciphering their tricks with the assistance of a second person. </p><p>I smirked at her sudden silence, giving her a second to realize just how badly she had fucked up, before adding one last sentence. “And, feel free to go and complain to the headmistress if you want. I’m sure she’ll be very helpful.” </p><p>With that, I left her behind, confident that she would accept my request, my mind already on the best ways to handle the surprising freedom I had found myself enjoying. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 32 Experience: 499160 / 528000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 4891 / 6528 Mana: 4910 / 8000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [84/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>",

    "content": "<p>“I remember your teachings,” Sarah started even as she pushed me on the couch. I followed her direction obediently, curious about her reaction — not to mention, leaving the driver’s seat to them was a unique experience, one that I was enjoying immensely. </p><p>“We should start by stretching properly, right?” Sarah said. </p><p>“Not exactly—“ Naomi started, only to freeze immediately because she had noticed Sarah had already started to lower herself in front of me, on her knees, her lips parting open. “You can’t be—“ she tried to amend her words, only for them to fade as Sarah’s lips wrapped around my girth.</p><p>She started pushing down with a speed that honestly surprised me, though, after a few bobbing, she pulled back. “Not a bad start, is it?” Sarah said mockingly. </p><p>Naomi’s gaze bounced between my glistening shaft and Sarah’s smug smirk, confusion clear in her eyes. For a moment, I was convinced that Sarah’s opening salvo was too deadly for Naomi to handle despite her earlier performance against the door, making Sarah the victor. </p><p>To her credit, she managed to give an answer. A stammering, confused answer, but an answer nonetheless. “J-just that,” she said dismissively. </p><p>“It’s just a start,” Sarah answered, her smirk widening. “As you always say, stretching is an important part of the exercise, so I’m starting slow. But feel free to show me if you can do better.” </p><p>Challenged that radically, I expected Naomi to pull back even further, staying passively to watch at best, and leaving the house if the words managed to trigger her too much. Yet, Naomi was more than ready to prove that Sarah wasn’t the only one with a fun bag of surprises. </p><p>“Of course, I can handle it!” Naomi growled, her anger propping her tone, though my gaze was sharp enough to catch her trembling legs. </p><p>The sudden decision was definitely overwhelming. </p><p>Sarah’s surprised expression was not unfamiliar to me. I had seen that exact level of shock the last night, while we were playing the game under the blanket, and she pulled it only to reveal Carrie was going much further under the covers. </p><p>It was the expression of a gambler who realized who had overplayed her hand.</p><p>Shocked, she didn’t say anything as Naomi knelt on my right, just scuttling to the left to give her some space, avoiding a confrontation. I bit my lips as Naomi wrapped her fingers around my girth, yet rather than looking at me, she stared at her friend, checking her reaction before she started lowering her head. </p><p>Under different circumstances, being dismissed like that might have bruised my ego, but considering I was biting my lips to hide my amusement, I appreciated that their attention focused on each other, allowing me to enjoy the moment without stress. </p><p>Naomi was much slower than Sarah as she lowered her beautiful head down, her fingers moving up and down, hesitant enough to reveal that, in terms of accumulated experience, she was no more developed than Carrie or Sarah had been before our little games had started. </p><p>Yet, even as her eyes widened due to the close view, she didn’t stop lowering her head down, showing that, once properly teased, exercising wasn’t the only way to trigger the more competitive part of her personality. She looked mesmerized as her beautiful pouty lips parted open, until they were connected around the crown. </p><p>It was not the first time her lips were around my shaft, of course, but under Sarah’s gaze, the atmosphere was completely different. </p><p>I couldn’t help but look at Sarah, who was watching her friend’s sudden courage in shock, her mouth agape, mesmerized by the results of her own words. Though, as Naomi started moving up and down, I watched her expression flicker and dance as she tried to adapt herself to the new situation. </p><p>Something that was much easier for her to handle after the short yet intense training she had gone through. </p><p>“She’s certainly amazing for a beginner, isn’t she?” I asked Sarah while Naomi continued to bob her beautiful head. </p><p>“Yeah, for a beginner,” Sarah growled, her competitiveness immediately back at my words as she grabbed Naomi’s hair and pulled her back, surprising me with her aggression. Naomi cried in pain. “Let me show you how it’s properly done,” she said as her lips landed on the same area Naomi’s lips were occupying for a moment, before she pushed down much more, touching the areas that were still dry even as the crown pushed against her throat. </p><p>Maybe it was the shock she felt against Sarah’s sudden aggressiveness, or maybe it was the confidence she had gained from her earlier performance Sarah managed to raise her gaze, giving me a glimpse of her beautiful eyes, trembling with a shy confusion and arousal. </p><p>“She’s definitely enthusiastic to give an example, isn’t she?” I said even as I put my hand on her head, deciding to help Naomi to balance their game a little by forcing Sarah into a delicious show. “And since she’s showing such great enthusiasm, she wouldn’t mind giving a better tutorial. Right, Sarah?” </p><p>Her answer was just a moan considering her occupied mouth, but there was no doubt about the positive nature of it. And since she left no doubt, I tightened my grip around her hair even as Naomi’s beautiful eyes widened, reflecting her utter and dreadful confusion. Yet, there were benefits to the way she dressed — or more accurately, absolutely lacking a stitch of clothing. With her moist core and her rock-hard nipples, there was no hiding just how much she was turned on. </p><p>And those signs didn’t suffer from any reduction as I tightened my grip around one of her best friend’s hair, forcing her down my shaft aggressively enough to trigger a loud gag. Good, I thought as I decided to increase my aggression, especially since I knew Sarah’s limits from direct experience. </p><p>I pushed her down even harder, manhandling her beautiful throat aggressively as the gags filled the room, turning it into a true spectacle. “She’s a true champion, isn’t she?” I said to Naomi even as I grabbed her wrist, leading her to sit next to me. </p><p>“She certainly —“ she started, but her words died rather quickly when my idle hands found her wetness and started circling around her knob, replaced by a moan. She had accepted such an aggressive touch rather easily, which, under different circumstances might have been unexpected, but one had to adjust standards thanks to the presence of Sarah, her obedient deepthroat working wonders to normalize the situation. </p><p>“Sorry, you were saying?” I said, greatly enjoying their moans, one muffled, one free. Naomi managed to throw a glare that might have been assumed angry, but that didn’t last long under the skilled treatment of my fingers, helped greatly by the highly erotic situation. </p><p>“Jerk,” she managed to murmur while Sarah limited herself to gags and moans. </p><p>“Do you want to give it a try?” I countered even as I nodded down, where Sarah was showing an amazing resilience trying to swallow my full length, though she was yet to succeed. “Do you think you can handle as much as Sarah?” </p><p>That earned a snort from Naomi, which surprised me. “I can do anything physical Sarah can do better,” she declared confidently.</p><p>“Oh, really?” I said as I pulled my hand away from Sarah’s head, allowing her to rise. </p><p>“Really?” Sarah copied my question once she pulled back, though only after she had coughed and wheezed for a moment, catching her breath back. “You really think you can be better than me in this?” </p><p>“Of course, I can,” Naomi answered even as she shuffled a bit and leaned forward until her tits pressed against my thigh, her lips positioned around my crown. “Let me show you why you need to work hard to get a perfect physique,” she declared. </p><p>“Oh, let’s see how that perfect physique works,” Sarah said as she grabbed Naomi’s head with both hands and pushed down before I could stop her. </p><p>Luckily, despite the sudden undertone of the competition they managed to light, they were still good friends, so she pushed her down more gently than I had pushed her moments earlier. </p><p>Naomi still gasped in shock as I felt her throat slowly closing around my shaft, showing that competing with Sarah might not be as easy as she might have first assumed. To her credit, she managed to stay down. </p><p>Since they were lost in their warped competition, I managed to reach to my phone, just enough to capture a fleeting moment of the dance they were sharing. ‘Your two BFFs are having a scuffle,’ I wrote, sending that with a photo as well. Normally, it was not something I would have done, but considering Sarah’s actions last night, and Naomi’s willingness to ambush Carrie in the bathroom after I implied she was there, I decided it wasn’t the worst transgression imaginable. </p><p>‘They are always a handful to control once they start,’ Carrie wrote, before a second message hit soon after. ‘There’s a reward for you if you exhaust them enough to keep them from fighting tomorrow,’ it said, this time accompanied by a picture. </p><p>A picture of Carrie wearing nothing but a sexy nightie that hugged her curves excellently, yet too transparent to hide anything. And, the recently-cut price tag on the bed suggested the lingerie was a recent purchase — probably acquired during the same mall trip I had helped Naomi pick up some interesting exercise clothing. </p><p>And, while messaging with Carrie was fun — especially when she was in the mood of attaching some more photos — it wasn’t as fun as my current circumstances. It wasn’t a slight to her, I thought even as I lowered my gaze. </p><p>There were scarcely few things in life that could match the beauty of two naked ladies, especially when one was pushing the other down to swallow more of my shaft…</p>",

    "content": "<p>Umi gazed down in shock as her newest friend grabbed the strings of her bottom. “Tiffany,” she gasped, but the sexy redhead ignored that in favor of giving a tug, freeing Umi’s body from the oppressive grasp of her last piece of clothing. </p><p>“Come on, girl,” she moaned seductively even as she put her hands on Umi’s thighs and forced them wider. “I’m already doing the hard part, what’s the harm if you provide some visual assistance to help me. It’s not like it makes a huge difference, right?” </p><p>“R-right,” Umi stammered, lacking the confidence to reject such a statement. Technically, Tiffany was right, and whether she kept the remaining half of her bikini on didn’t really matter, but, that was only under the condition that we didn’t push even further, which was almost impossible to believe. </p><p>Luckily, Umi was, thanks to the combined weight of the pleasure she was feeling and her natural naivety, one of the few that might believe it enough to keep her from protesting against such a move. </p><p>And that was all a woman like Tiffany required. “I knew I could trust you,” Tiffany moaned playfully as she pushed her head down once again, but this time, her hands stayed on Umi’s thighs, caressing her soft skin repeatedly. </p><p>It was the perfect assistance for the lingering kisses I had been delivering to her neck, turning her body limp with pleasure, her arms dangling on the side, revealing her unrestricted beauty for my eyes, begging me to take the last step.</p><p>But I kept myself back. </p><p>Not because I was afraid Umi would change her mind — she lacked the strength to reject the call of the power — but to properly enjoy the process. So, I cupped her breasts again even as my lips reached to her shoulder, enjoying her confused moans even as she froze at my touch. </p><p>Though, that state of stillness didn’t last long. A girl as innocent as Umi had no chance against the endless pleasure from the double-assault she was receiving, let alone the exotic location she was experiencing those feelings in. </p><p>“Delicious,” I murmured while I switched shoulders, my fingers busy memorizing the spectacular details of her breasts, each second making the moment more precious. As she shuffled, her naked ass rubbed against my stomach, sending shivers through my body. </p><p>I closed my eyes because I wanted to enjoy the process even more, but it turned out that my partner-in-crime had other ideas. Umi let out a gasp a couple of minutes later, which coincided with the time Tiffany was not dealing with my shaft. </p><p>Curious, I opened and looked down, only to see a certain redness a bit further than where it was supposed to be. Tiffany had clearly decided to join the fun more directly, her head between Umi’s pale legs, teasing her in the most direct manner she could without relying on external tools. </p><p>Umi moaned, helpless against the pleasure Tiffany’s tongue delivered, its dance enough to suggest it wasn’t the first time she had delivered such naughty assistance to a female friend — not that it was too surprising with the ease she had displayed with Umi all night. </p><p>For a while, Umi’s shocked moans filled the roof, but when Tiffany pulled back, I caught her mischievous eyes. “I have experimented in college once or twice,” she whispered seductively. </p><p>I sincerely doubted that her experience was that limited, but rather than commenting, I just smirked, nodding at her to continue her work. </p><p>But not before grabbing Umi’s body and standing up. I sat down at the edge of the hot tub, allowing Tiffany better access to Umi’s core without being bothered by water. Though, that wasn’t the only thing I had done, as I had changed the position slightly, so that my shaft was lodged between Umi’s cheeks instead of staying between her thighs, making the moment even more pleasurable while also giving Tiffany more direct access. </p><p>This time, Umi didn’t say anything, just moaning in pleasure, her concerns about the improper nature of our situation broken against the pleasure of the moment. As Tiffany leaned down to take her place again, Umi started to tremble softly, her hips rocking back and forth hesitantly. </p><p>“Good girl,” I whispered into her ear, making her tremble even as I started thrusting my hips to enhance her pleasure even more. I couldn’t see her core with Tiffany blocking, but I could easily imagine the way she was gushing with pleasure. </p><p>Soon, the pleasure got too overwhelming for Umi’s inexperienced body as Tiffany’s tongue continued to tease her. A moan exploded off her lips, even more louder as she leaned hard against my chest, her beautiful breasts thrust in the air, her nipples rock hard with pleasure. </p><p>Tiffany pulled back, a satisfied smile on her lips as she watched Umi shudder and tremble. “Do you think she can handle it,” she asked playfully even as she looked at Umi with pride, like a painter who had just completed a masterpiece. </p><p>“Probably not,” I said as I carefully shifted Umi to the side, letting her lay on her back against the hard surface. </p><p>“Really,” Tiffany said, a confused expression on her face, though that only lasted until I grabbed her waist to pull her closer, our lips separated by inches, the smell of Umi still strong enough to reach my nose. I said nothing, just smirked playfully, so she asked. “Aren’t you afraid our innocent beauty would escape?” </p><p>“Why would I?” I asked, and Tiffany quirked a questioning eyebrow, though that only lasted until I pushed her down, replaced by a mocking laugh. </p><p>Directly on top of Umi, her arms positioned to prevent any sneaky escape when we were distracted. “Naughty—“ Tiffany started, only for her words to be interrupted by a moan as I pressed against her entrance. </p><p>Thanks to the extended foreplay session we all shared, I slid inside smoothly, making Tiffany moan in appreciation. “Damn,” she growled in pleasure. “I missed your monster inside me, it’s such a good change of pace.” </p><p>However, as I slid inside her repeatedly, my gaze was on Umi’s face, whose eyes widened in shock, the realization of what was happening above her enough to overcome the aftermath of her pleasure. </p><p>“W-what’s going on?” Umi asked, though there was less hesitancy in her tone than I expected, replaced by arousal. Clearly, Tiffany’s tongue was even more effective than I had expected. </p><p>“What do you think — what’s going on?” Tiffany asked, teasing, though unable to prevent a moan as I invaded her core aggressively. “I’m working to earn my husband’s promotion, of course,” she added, somehow managing to deliver that last sentence righteously despite everything. </p><p>“But I thought you said you wouldn’t go all the way—“ Umi tried to answer, only to be interrupted by Tiffany. Not by words, however, but by a searing, merciless kiss that would make any man proud. </p><p>Since Tiffany was working on Umi so passionately, I put my hand on her inner thigh as well, roaming up and down to remind her of my presence. After all, with the aggressive moves Tiffany was putting on her, it was the safer option. o</p><p>It would have been a little humiliating if Tiffany managed to steal Umi from me with a last-minute change. </p><p>Of course, my real attention was on Tiffany as I aggressively worked to bring her to climax to equalize the score between her and Umi, impaling her again and again. Tiffany proved how special she was by continuing to gyrate her impressive hips even as she was busy teaching Umi the subtle art of kissing… </p><p>“Is going all the way so bad?” Tiffany suddenly asked as she pulled back. Umi looked at her, dazed, taking a while to remember her last interrupted statement. </p><p>“O-of course,” she answered the moment the realization hit, but her words lacked the conviction that the speed of her answer might otherwise imply. </p><p>“Really, you’re saying that a night of pleasure that your fiancee would never learn to get such a high raise, getting you a bigger house, paying your student loans sooner, and even allowing you to build an impressive wardrobe that would drive those jealous classmates crazy is a bad deal,” Tiffany whispered. </p><p>Umi trembled during Tiffany’s explanation, her pleasure-addled brain lacking the vigor to answer, especially since her attention split between her words, and the show we were providing as I continued to slide in and out, the rhythmic sound of flesh colliding creating an excellent backdrop to our discussion. “I … I can’t,” she muttered, though I could see her determination melting away. </p><p>All I needed was to push inside, and she would be mine. Yet, I pulled back and dragged Tiffany with me. “If that’s your wish,” I said. </p><p>The shocked expression on Umi’s face was simply wondrous. She stayed frozen for a moment, then she reached to pick up her towel, wrapped it around herself hurriedly and run away, not even bothering to pick up her swimsuit. </p><p>“Why did you let her go?” Tiffany asked as she looked at me, surprised and a little frustrated. “I have worked all night for that.”  </p><p>“For the fun of the hunt, of course,” I said with a smirk. “Don’t worry. You’ll still get your gift. At least, if you work for it hard enough,” I added as I pushed her down, continuing our little dance even more intensely. </p><p>The first day of our little business trip was going amazing… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Leaving Sapphire behind in her bedroom, resting after our strenuous political discussion that allowed us to create a strategy — at least, the beginnings of one — against the upcoming danger, but that didn’t prevent me from feeling empty as I stepped into the secret passage once more. </p><p>A part of it was certainly the exhaustion. I might have not collapsed as Sapphire had, but that didn’t mean our lingering discussion had no effect on my body. And our ‘peace’ talk was hardly the only thing I had dealt with today. </p><p>Yet, the bigger part was about the weight of my decision about the next steps. The ploy of faking Sapphire’s assassination was nice, especially since it came with her full agreement, smart enough to realize that being the target of a powerful enemy was bad, and two competing enemies were much worse. Bringing the Valkyrie back to the capital was an even better development, as she was one of the few opponents that managed to earn the full extent of my respect. She was strong, smart, and beautiful, of course, but those weren’t the reasons I respected her. </p><p>It was her personality. </p><p>She was pragmatic enough to have a very long-term agreement with me, open-minded enough to add some very fun activities to make our occasional trades very relaxing, and most importantly, despite her pragmatic attitude might imply, principled enough to never compromise the benefits of the Empire. </p><p>Or more accurately, the benefits of citizens of the Empire. In our deals, she had arranged the death of more than one noble, which, from the perspective of the nobility, was the biggest treason imaginable. Even Sapphire didn’t have a much different perspective, as among all their fault, no one counted being too concerned for the ‘peasants’ one of them. </p><p>Even the dark families would have targeted her with a vengeance if they knew her approach. After all, despite the constant battles with the Empire, ultimately, in their perspective, it was just a competition. A noble protecting the peasants at expense of one of their noble peers was unimaginable… </p><p>It was the reason that they were so quick to annotate me from coming from the lost families rather than digging down into my heritage. Revealing me as a commoner would have hurt my power, but it would give thousands and thousands of commoners ideas above their station. </p><p>After all, if I could do it, so could someone else. </p><p>So, while her attitude might earn the enmity of her peers and her enemies alike, it only made me fonder of her. Never to the point that forgetting it was an alliance of convenience, of course. Just because I loved her attitude and her muscular yet curvy body didn’t mean I lost my mind when I was with her.  </p><p>I couldn’t help but wonder how she would react when she learned the news of my demise was not entirely accurate. </p><p>I shook my head, distracting myself from pointless thoughts and focusing on the real challenge. The next step of discussion. I took a deep breath as I started thinking, trying to pick a strategic direction. </p><p>Then, a name popped into my mind, along with the sight of an aggressive beauty currently locked in a basement in an ironic reversal of our little situations. </p><p>It was time to meet with my belligerent ranger once again, finally from a position of strength. </p><p>Once again using the secret passages, it barely took minutes for me to tensely stare at the building that held Isolde’s prison, covered with several rotating wards using a completely different magical tradition. Though the wards were hardly the source of my nervousness. </p><p>It was the phoenix who was responsible for the presence of the wards, with enough power to scare me even with the famous magical items that were in my possession. </p><p>I carefully examined the wards, expecting them to be changed enough to make the access token I had used useless, already planning the best way to get the attention of the phoenix and find an excuse for her to allow me to visit Isolde alone. I didn’t want my first visit to be with her, because Isolde knew I wasn’t the king, and lacked the skill to lie about it — and the political awareness to understand why such a lie was necessary to help her in the first place. </p><p>I needed to find a way to either convince the Phoenix to let me go down without a complaint, or prevent Isolde from speaking — probably through magical means — but neither strategy was particularly reliable. Yet, after I closed into the wards, using the Blade of Shadows to stay concealed, I realized there was no need to find an excuse.  </p><p>The ward was completely unchanged, and reacted to the fake token by creating a gate for me. </p><p>“Incredible,” I murmured, unable to comprehend the negligence she displayed by not changing the wards after knowing I had managed to sneak in during my last visit. I already knew that she was reckless and arrogant, that level of recklessness was an anathema to me, significantly changing her value as an ally, or even as a potential tool.</p><p>Even Emma was more useful. At least, her treason was easier to manage.  </p><p>Luckily, I wasn’t there for her today, and I sneaked inside using another fake key, crafted at the moment by me, once again getting shocked by the poor defense the wards provided despite the immense power they were throbbing with. </p><p>Once again, I was greeted by the marble statues of hooded warriors, the magic radiating off them enough to intimidate me despite its not being the first time I had seen them. I followed through the corridor, using the same trick to stay concealed, and took the stairs to the basement. </p><p>Everything went without a hitch, and soon, I was in front of the cell, holding the objective of my visit. Isolde. </p><p>I couldn’t help but smirk at the sight in front of me, and not just because of the delicious irony. The cell Isolde was locked in was much nicer than my little empty prison, with a small yet comfortable-looking bed, a chair, and a small table. Even though the table was empty, the broken plates on the corner showed that it hadn’t been empty initially. </p><p>I had a feeling that Lancelot was trying to earn her forgiveness — in the form of, sorry I betrayed and imprisoned you, but a comfortable bed should be enough compensation — but if her frantic walk was any indicator, it wasn’t working as well as Lancelot might have hoped. Her hair was frazzled and her eyes red, suggesting she didn’t sleep at all after she had been captured. Her anger was gone — anger was a hard emotion to sustain without a direct target — leaving its place to pure confusion, no doubt the result of a long yet fruitless night as she tried to unravel the sudden betrayal. </p><p>Poor girl, I thought as I smirked, helplessly dealing with a problem that was outside her comfort zone, and with no warning to soften the blow. </p><p>It was time to talk to her. I let the spell that surrounded me fall, but not before casting a silencing spell to keep the rest of the place unaware, which turned out to be a smart idea. “You!” she shouted loudly as she reached to her back to pull her bow, only for her fingers to meet air. </p><p>Lancelot might be an idiot, but he wasn’t to the level of imprisoning Isolde with her weapons, especially the ranged kind. After all, what she lacked in political ability, she more than compensated with her spectacular ranged abilities.</p><p>“Me,” I said with a taunting smirk. It was a bad idea to taunt her, even slightly, under the circumstances, but sometimes it was hard to resist the temptation, especially when facing someone like Isolde who had loved to use violence on me during my imprisonment. Even more, she was the only member of their little party that didn’t pay the required price for my forgiveness. </p><p>Luckily, she was in a prime position for me to extract that price. That soft, beautiful price. </p><p>Or, considering how Isolde treated me, maybe not so soft…  </p><p>“I should have known!” she growled in anger as she took a big step toward me. It was hardly the most intimidating sight with the bars of the cell on my way, but as a physical combatant, it was hard for her to break such habits. </p><p>“You should have known, what? It’s not a shortlist for you sweetie, be more specific,” I countered, unable to hold back a little tease. </p><p>“I should have known you are behind my imprisonment!” she growled, missing my subtle insult in her anger. </p><p>I made an exaggerated gesture as I put my hand on my chest, acting like I had been just shot in the heart. “You wound me, sweetie,” I whispered. “I went all the trouble trying to save you, and you’re blaming me for the crimes of that blond braggart. It’s hardly fair.” </p><p>“What kind of nonsense are you talking about?” she growled as her anger was stoked further by my explanation. “Do you think that I’m an idiot you can trick?” </p><p>She wasn’t an idiot, but she was not the sharpest knife either. </p><p>Ironically, however, that made it much harder to trick her under these circumstances. Truly smart people had a habit of rationalization, so, it was very easy to push them into a completely different direction just by giving a couple of clues, just like I did to Sapphire when I implied I had arranged my capture from the beginning, an explanation that turned reasonable after the appearance of two enemies. </p><p>However, one important thing about such a trick was to let the opponent fill in the blanks. If I had given Sapphire a detailed explanation, she wouldn’t have believed it, but by giving her a few clues and letting her connect the dots, it turned into truth in her mind. </p><p>Unfortunately, that strategy wouldn’t work against Isolde. </p><p>I needed to convince her in a different manner… </p><p><br></p>",

    "content": "<p>For all their difference in application and delivery, battles of magic and battles of martial prowess were surprisingly similar. </p><p>Two of those similarities were particularly critical for my current circumstances. The great advantage of a robust fortification — of which an active ward qualified — was important, enough to turn most battles into a decisive conclusion. </p><p>Just like a battle, however, an ambush brought much more significant benefits along with it. </p><p>Of course, the keyword there was successful, as every attempt to an ambush was a double-edged sword. If halted halfway, or delivered improperly, the assaulting would suffer much more than the defenders. </p><p>For that reason, I couldn’t help but feel tense as I started gathering my magic to power up the runes I had drawn. The same equation was also applied to the fortifications. The layered ward they had created to protect their command center was impressive, giving them a great fortification advantage. But like almost anything in life, it was not entirely positive. Its magical brightness blinded them, just like a huge cliff protecting the city, but allowing a group of climbers to ambush the defenders. </p><p>“Be ready,” I whispered to my ally, waiting until I received her nod, and triggered my runes. </p><p>If there was one advantage to having an ally — even a dubious one — during a delicate operation like that, it gave me the chance to turn my focus on the attack, with no concern of maintaining a defensive ward or observing my surroundings. </p><p>That allowed me to split my attention between two different elements of attack, one directing the seven bolts of lightning that sprung out from the runes I had drawn, cutting through the wards with ease only the lightning element could achieve. With that unique nature, it cut through the wards even when the mage connected to the active ward reacted in time and appropriately to reinforce the defenses just before the lightning exploded on its surface. </p><p>Yet, despite its success, it wasn’t the part that took the majority of my attention. That honor went to seventeen unique runes I drew as an outer circle, allowing me to focus my attention as I turned my attention to the active ward around the building, pushing my will against the controller — another trick that was only possible I was trying to attack the ward from the same direction. </p><p>The success was inevitable. </p><p>There was a reason that best practice was to stay under the cover of the wards and direct it outside, or stand outside and direct it inside. Living inside the ward while keeping the wards inverted allowed the exact strategy I applied, one that was supposed to be impossible against active wards. </p><p>They clearly assumed that using two layers of wards would address the shortcoming of their tactical choice. </p><p>They were wrong. </p><p>It took barely a breath for me to steal the control of the wards, the impact of my assault, along with the impact of the lightning bolt, damaged him greatly.  </p><p>If they were ordinary mages, I would have expected them to react in panic and fear, but for them, I had a feeling that it would be optimistic. Their brainwashing allowed them to maintain their focus and attention. Still, I didn’t immediately receive a flurry of assault, suggesting that even their brainwashing had limits. </p><p>Though those limits were still impressive considering it took several bolts of lightning bursting inside without the slightest warning to shake their enforced calm, and even then, only for a second. </p><p>Their first reaction confirmed the accuracy of my strategy of stealing the wards over killing them, because I felt a warning spell bouncing against the wards, one that bounced off the active wards that were under my control. </p><p>With their help, I easily blocked that and the following messages. Unfortunately, one of the spells he cast succeeded without a problem because it didn’t target outside, but inside. I had a guess that it had just awakened all the guards that were sleeping and patrolling upstairs. </p><p>Which meant that we were under a time limit. A mage was much more dangerous than a soldier, but ultimately, we were still mortal. A silent arrow, or a surprise blade would kill us equally quick, and while there were ways to deal with that, none of them were particularly reliable when simultaneously trying to battle with a group of mages at the same time. </p><p>I needed to move faster. I triggered the runes I had etched earlier, launching another seven bolts of lightning, destroying the remains of the ward — along with the walls of the room.</p><p>Followed by a desperate dodge as several spears flew toward me with a great speed, each glowing thickly with a number of runes that could never be drawn by an ordinary mage. They were sorcerer-made, and they were a threat even for my defensive spells. </p><p>If someone else was in my place, they might have pulled back, waiting for them to expand their ammunition. It wouldn’t be a bad decision in terms of dealing with the mages, as I doubted that, even a Patrician house would have an endless source of sorcerer-grade projectile weapons. Yet, the painful lessons I had received since my childhood taught me a different story. </p><p>Never give the enemy time to recover, as one could never be sure just how many trump cards the enemy was hiding. Of course, the upcoming arrival of the ordinary soldiers just made the situation more urgent. </p><p>Rather than charging inside, I rolled, the dust creating an excellent cover as several spears sailed above my head. I stood up, ready to launch an assault, only to be hit by a familiar aura, now that the effect of the destroyed wards started to fade away. </p><p>I thanked all the gods I could remember simultaneously for my decision to charge inside and not give them any time to prepare. </p><p>It was the aura of a dragon heart. </p><p>No, I corrected as I glanced toward a glass display case, displaying several glowing crystals of various colors and sizes, the smallest barely bigger than a nail, the biggest almost as big as my fist, all giving the impression of a living heart and a rock at the same time…</p><p>It was the aura of an impressive number of dragon hearts. </p><p>I rapidly counted nine even as something in my chest that was not my heart throbbed. It was my magical core, one that had a similar object buried in its center, powering me constantly. A true treasure that would make everyone jealous. </p><p>No wonder they had so many defenses here. With that many dragon hearts, even the reputation of the strongest Patrician house wouldn’t protect them, and the enemies would hound them intensely, both other Patrician houses, and other nations.</p><p>Compared to the treasure, the protection of a dozen mages could be considered light, almost negligent.    </p><p>Two of those mages were already down, one dead with a smoking body, suggesting he was unlucky enough to suffer a lightning bolt, the other collapsed without the slightest wound, probably responsible for managing the active ward before two waves of lightning bolts hit, and triggering a backlash he couldn’t manage.  </p><p>Yet, it still left ten mages I needed to deal with. And I didn’t have the luxury of ignoring them, not when four of them were already dashing toward the case, no doubt to equip dragon hearts, one stayed behind, still trying to trigger an alarm, while the other five were already casting together, trying to create a new ward to give them the protection they needed, carrying a variety of weapons. </p><p>Weapons that were hard to ignore, I noted. Every weapon was unique, almost like they were a group of bandits, carrying a motley set of ill-fitting weapons, not allowing them to use any kind of tactics. </p><p>Yet, the magical aura of their weapons was more than enough to conceal that fact. Every single weapon was glowing with surprising intensity, enough to make my skin crawl. Worse, unlike the spears they had thrown earlier which carried deadly yet straightforward enchantments, those weapons were hardly ordinary. </p><p>Still, deadly as those weapons could be, my first priority was the four that were dashing toward the dragon hearts. Maybe it was a biased perspective, coming from the memories of an earlier desperate encounter where I was able to turn the tables after a ridiculous suicidal gambit, but I considered them the greatest threat. </p><p>The problem, with the brainwashing they were going through, I had no doubt that those mages wouldn’t even blink before sacrificing their lives. And, while they might not survive after such an attempt, it was hardly something I would care about if I was defeated. </p><p>I didn’t have the luxury of ignoring five mages carrying deadly enchanted weapons for a moment and waved my hand, sending ten bolts of lightning toward all of them. Pity my runes were already spent. Without their assistance, casting on such scale was difficult, enough to exhaust me even with the constant flow of magic my throbbing core provided. </p><p>I hoped to take all of them together before they could develop a defense against my lightning bolts. </p><p>Unfortunately, despite my aggressive choice, my success was limited. The five that were trying to create a defensive ward abandoned their efforts momentarily and used their weapons. Which, much to my shock, worked, suggesting that the weapons they were wielding were even stronger than I expected. </p><p>Even then, it was not without a consequence. It forced them to step back, ruining the ward they were trying to create. </p><p>I had better luck against my other targets. The four that dashing toward the dragon hearts, and the one that was still trying to send an alarm message through the wards despite my interference, reacted too late, turning into charcoal. </p><p>They tried to defend themselves by creating a last-minute shield, but against lightning, and without the assistance of mysterious magical weapons the others sported, their efforts were useless. My spell cut through their shields easily, too fast to give them time to react. </p><p>There was a reason sorcerers were game-changers on the battlefield. Against a sorcerer, it was hard to resist without something to give an unfair advantage like a strong ward — that had been already destroyed — extremely strong magical weapons — that the unlucky targets they lacked — or a strategic formation to spread the effort — which they didn’t have time to set during their desperate dash, no doubt expecting their allies to hold the line.  </p><p>Unfortunately, a second later, I realized that my action came with a cost I wasn’t expecting, because the biggest piece of dragon heart suddenly glowed with a blinding intensity and started to pull the deflected lightning bolts into itself. </p><p>Then, it started glowing, its aura intensifying with each throbbing. </p><p>And just like that, the pain in my chest multiplied, reaching a point that drove me down to my knees. </p><p>Which was impressive considering my pain resistance, trained since I was a little boy thanks to the not-so-tender mercies of my late grandfather and what he termed as training. </p><p>It was an emergency, and not just because I found myself facing five mages ready to charge toward me with weapons throbbing with a dangerous amount of magic, the ease they carried these weapons suggested a certain experience. </p><p>I turned to my unwilling ally, hoping that she might have a solution considering her expertise. </p><p>“It’s resonating,” she gasped as she dashed toward me, followed by a bunch of garbled words that were no doubt her native language, though the intensity suggested their nature as swearwords. Ignoring my pointed gaze, she put her hands on my back, her magic invading my body. </p><p>“Cycle your magic to follow mine,” she ordered, and I started to do so immediately, which helped to take the worst of the pain. </p><p>All I needed to deal with was five mages ready to charge toward me while I was unable to move or cast a spell. </p><p>Trivial. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Megan didn’t appreciate my interruption, but after the victory she had achieved over her friend, her mood was good enough to let that slide. “Sure,” she said, and threw one last grin to her friend before she grabbed my arm and dragged me into the pool, once again showing the prickier aspect of her personality. </p><p>Admittedly, it didn’t seem too smart to antagonize the person that was about to record us and leak our photos to the public, but I didn’t vocalize that particular thought. </p><p>It wasn’t my problem. </p><p>Instead, I slipped in the water, then turned to watch as Megan followed. The sight of her beautiful body slowly sinking into the water was a great pleasure. Her combative personality and her obsession with fame made her difficult to deal with, it certainly didn’t detract any from her spectacular beauty. </p><p>Watching her as she slowly submerged into the shimmering water of the pool, her smooth skin slowly getting drenched, her movements, no matter how careful, challenged her skimpy swimsuit’s ability to keep her body covered — even for the already-generous definition of the word coverage that could be applied to her swimsuit in the first place. </p><p>“So, what’s the idea,” I said the moment she slipped into the water, wrapping my arm around her waist in the process, pulling her closer to me. </p><p>If I was going to pose as her boyfriend, I was going to enjoy the benefits. </p><p>“We’re going to give them a show, of course,” Megan said, not doing anything to extract herself from my arm. “But first, we need to look like we had been swimming.” And, just like that, she put her hands on my shoulders, and pushed me into the water, weaponizing our closeness for her nefarious aims. </p><p>Resisting was not impossible, of course. As far as tackles went, hers wasn’t exactly devastating, but there was no harm in giving her a little victory. </p><p>Especially when it gave me a chance to retaliate. </p><p>I pulled up, making a show of coughing and spluttering, much to Megan’s amusement. From the corner of my eyes, I could see Kim snickering as well, which was a beautiful sight, giving me a nice feeling about our supposed date. </p><p>“So, that’s how you want to play,” I said, growling playfully. </p><p>Megan’s snickers turned a fearful gasp when she found herself being lifted bridal style. “Don’t you dare, you’ll ruin my hair —“ she growled. Her tone was confident, like she was absolutely sure that I would follow her order even after she pushed me into the water. </p><p>That thought didn’t last long, dying in a spectacular explosion of droplets as I threw her into the water. </p><p>As she spluttered herself back to the surface, I wasn’t the only one audibly chuckling, though, I noticed Kim pressing the screen of her phone passionately. I caught her eye. “It’s for the blackmail folder,” she smirked. </p><p>I was tempted to answer her, but when Megan pulled to the surface. Despite the anger on her face, it was a beautiful sight. Her body glistened, her blonde hair sticking to her shoulders, adding another layer of attraction. </p><p>Even her top was dislodged a bit, giving a glimpse of one of her rosy areolas. Pity they were still in place. They were more stable than their flimsy look suggested. </p><p>“I’ll kill you,” she growled. </p><p>“Go ahead, but what would people say if they learn you’re strong enough to kill your football player boyfriend.” </p><p>“He’s got you there, sweetie,” Kim interrupted with a laugh. “And imagine if they learn that you’re an illegal racer as well.” </p><p>And just like that, I learned another interesting thing about Megan, not that it shocked me too much. I had seen her drive with surprising proficiency. Together with her fancy car, I didn’t have any trouble imagining her on a dark road, racing with other rich kids for reputation. </p><p>Yet, Megan didn’t appreciate her friend’s sudden alliance with me, nor did she appreciate the accidental slip. “Shut your mouth,” she said to her friend. Someone else might have reacted to Megan’s attitude negatively, but Kim just chuckled, suggesting that she was used to Megan’s attitude. </p><p>Megan turned me. “If you do it again…” she warned. </p><p>“Whatever you wish, sweetheart,” I said, shrugging my shoulders. </p><p>“You’re going to delay us another half an hour,” she added as she started moving toward the edge of the pool, but I grabbed her waist and pulled back. “What are you doing?” </p><p>“Are you sure you want to pose with perfect hair,” I suggested? “It’ll certainly look better, but do you really want to give your opponents an excuse to say the photos are staged.” </p><p>“They are not that smart,” Megan stated. </p><p>“If you want to take a bet of that,” I said as I loosened my grip around her waist, but she didn’t go forward, suggesting I managed to convince her. She didn’t thank me, of course, as she clearly lacked the ability to show appreciation without being forced. “What’s the plan for this show, then?” I followed. </p><p>“Nothing too extreme,” she said. “We’re going to put on a show like we’re getting frisky in the pool. A few shots that look like we’re having fun underwater, maybe a couple of candid ones on the corner of the pool, suggestive enough to let the imagination run wild.” </p><p>“Isn’t it a bit extreme?” I asked, surprised by the ploy. “I thought you were trying to create a more wholesome image.”</p><p>“That was the idea,” she growled. “But not all plans are as solid as I hoped.” </p><p>I wasn’t shocked at the vehemence of her tone because I understood the source. Creating an image was difficult, especially one that was distinct enough to be leveraged as a public figure. I had no idea what Megan’s ultimate objective for her popularity was, but it was clear that a reputation for being frigid or limited bedroom performance was not a part of it.</p><p>However, what surprised me more was the intensity of her dedication. She seemed very determined to kill the rumors before they could get established, showing a strategic mind and a killer instinct at the same time. </p><p>She would have made a good chess player if she had the time and was willing to dedicate herself.  </p><p>Ultimately, however, she didn’t explain her reasons, and I didn’t bother digging for them. Her situation seemed interesting, but I had my own, much bigger, problems to focus on. </p><p>Luckily, I didn’t need to know her exact objective to help her shed such a reputation. It was certainly not a chore, I determined even as my gaze drifted down, enjoying the sight of her barely covered body. </p><p>Kim interrupted my gaze. “Start swimming around her,” she ordered. “We should get a few simple shots at first to set the mood and make it more convincing, a few cozy pictures wouldn’t hurt in the mix to better sell your relationship.” </p><p>I followed her request, and started circling around Megan, whose annoyance about the earlier dunk had yet to fade away. So, I did the only reasonable thing, and deliberately hit my strides harder, splashing some more water on her face. </p><p>“What are you doing!” Megan growled in anger, which contrasted with Kim’s growing smile. </p><p>“Keep it going,” she ordered. “It’s good to have a few domestic shots, it’ll help us sell the romance between you two. It’ll make the eventual breakup even more impactful.” The explanation was certainly convincing, but her vindictive smile suggested that her orders might be more about the date that had been forced on by Megan than the strategic necessity of such photos. </p><p>Such a complicated friendship. </p><p>“Do we really need it?” Megan murmured. “Are you sure leaning to the domestic is a good idea when we’re going to break up this Sunday? Wouldn’t it work worse?” </p><p>“Not if you don’t want the others commenting whether your relationship was fake all along. You know we need to sell the breakup more convincingly,” Kim answered. </p><p>“By the way—“ I started, interrupting myself with another splash when Megan turned to me, earning another angry growl. “What’s the exact story for the breakup?” I asked, making sure my tone was serious despite my previous actions, Intimidation trait worked wonders to help me convey my seriousness without any explicit threat.  </p><p>And despite her bitchy attitude, Megan was smart enough to understand the nature of the question. “Nothing too scandalous,” she answered. “We’re going to have a fight after the game, and after a loss, I’ll publicly try to convince you that it’s a waste of time to spend your time in our football team after another horrible loss, you’re going to react badly to the suggestion of betraying your teammates, we’ll let the fight escalate without getting too personal, and break up, and later the night, you can let those enthusiastic cheerleaders to nurse you back to life after your sad breakup.” </p><p>“Sounds simple enough,” I answered. It was a simple yet smart plan, framing our relationship as a rebound, while positioning the game as a breakup reason allowed us not to be a villain. </p><p>Of course, the whole plan relied on the team getting another loss, but that was more or less a given. The offense was a mess, and even though the defense was in a better condition, football had an interesting quirk. </p><p>If the offense caused too many turnovers, it would result in the defense staying on the field for too long, which in turn exhausted the defense. </p><p>Playing was more exhausting for the defense for two reasons. First, most teams had more offense players to ensure a wider range of attack options. Second, and more importantly, the offense knew what exactly was going to be the play, allowing the offense not to exhaust themselves unnecessarily. </p><p>On the contrary, the defensive players had to respond with their full power every play, exhausting them much better in the process. It wasn’t a problem in a balanced, normal game, but with an incompetently-coached, mistake-prone offense like our team had, disaster was inevitable. </p><p>“That sounds like a plan,” I murmured. </p><p>“Enough talking,” Kim interrupted. “We still have a lot of work to do, start posing. Start getting frisky.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>My concerns about a painful sparring session didn’t get alleviated when we finally arrived at our destination. </p><p>Mostly, it was a standard sparring room. A huge, open area with no impediment, the floor covered in stone, each inch enchanted carefully for extra durability to resist the aggression of the high-leveled combatants, and several wards ready to be activated in case of a danger to prevent death.  </p><p>Yet, the details shouted to me that it was going to be a painful battle. The level difference between her and my fake identity was already a given, but apparently, that wasn’t enough for her because she had pushed for such an unfair area of battle. </p><p>Of course, at a glance, an underground arena with no obstruction seemed like the perfect place to have a fair duel between two high-leveled individuals, but that discounted one important fact. Every small detail of the arena was designed to enhance the advantages of the melee fighter and chip away at the perks of magic. </p><p>The size of the arena was the first big problem. It was not exactly small with an area of several hundred square feet area, but for a supernatural warrior, even the longest distance could be covered in less than a second. Combined with the height of the ceiling, just below fifteen feet, a distance that she could easily jump with halfway decent Strength and Speed stats, any movement advantage a mage might establish was completely gone. </p><p>The thick enchantments that covered every surface were another challenge, basically ruling out most of the elemental tricks. The earth spells were out directly, but even a glance was enough to show that it would also weaken any water or fire spell that they came into contact with, removing most of the spells that a mage could use for zoning away from the fighter. </p><p>So-called security wards were another trap. Ideally, they shouldn’t trigger unless overwhelmingly powerful magic was used, but I had sufficient magical expertise to catch some last-minute adjustments on them. They would go off much easier than advised, wasting the mana of the mage, after which no doubt my opponent suggest that we continue. </p><p>The last confirmation about whether it was intentional was the several bottles of healing potions, each brewed freshly as indicated by their magical aura, no doubt there to keep me in fighting shape…</p><p>So that she could torture me longer. </p><p>I looked at her beautiful face with admiration as she stood at the opposite side of the room, raising a wooden stick — the only thing that could be classified as an advantage for me, as it was much less deadly than a sword or an ax, but I had a suspicion that the only reason she picked was to maximize the pain she inflicted. </p><p>“Are you ready?” she asked, doing her best to sound calm, but unable to hide her vicious anticipation, confirming that subterfuge was not one of the skills she had picked. </p><p>“No weapon for me?” I asked. </p><p>“I’m sure a big man like you wouldn’t need a clutch like that,” she suggested, her smile widening. </p><p>“Oh, someone was talking to her friend,” I answered with a wink, watching as her amusement turned into fury. </p><p>“Let’s begin,” she growled, and dashed forward without even waiting for an answer. </p><p>Damn, I thought even as I started moving, doing my best to stay under the limits of what was reasonable for a high-leveled mage even as I raised my hand, conjuring an arcana shield. </p><p>[-128 Mana]</p><p>Its purple glow didn’t survive for long, shattering at the impact, her impressive charge more than enough to deal with it — even if I hadn’t designed it to explode in the first place. </p><p>It was a shaped explosion, all its strength connecting with her. Yet, it didn’t delay her more than a fraction of a second, which wasn’t enough for the limited version to pull back. Her staff connected to my ribs, hitting hard enough to send me flying, and I hit against the wall. </p><p>[-138 HP] </p><p>“Try to be more attentive,” she said as she swung her staff, yet, despite sending me flying in a very undignified and painful unassisted flight, she was still angry. </p><p>Curious, I thought even as I made a show of standing up very slowly, even as I carefully used my mana remotely to test her soul space, to catch whether she was wearing a disguise. It was the real point of my exploding shield, letting some of my mana stick on her skin, using the broken shield as an excuse in case she had equipped any magical talent. </p><p>Yet, a glimpse into her soul space showed she had absolutely no magical talent, making me much more relaxed. So, rather than dispersing my mana, I let it stay in her soul space, getting a more detailed glimpse of her abilities. </p><p>She had a very high level, I realized as I started examining her soul space. </p><p>Forty-two! </p><p>I couldn’t help but feel like it was a waste just to deal with me, because even a casual glance was enough to catch the mana evaporating from her soul space, much faster than not-Delia had been losing it earlier today. Not-Delia probably could have lasted almost a week with her skills — assuming the evaporation rate stayed constant, of course, which was not a given — but I would be greatly surprised if my current opponent could last even for a day. </p><p>Either it was a difference between recipients, or their target level made a huge difference. And considering they weren’t always walking around in level forties and fifties, I was willing to bet that it was mainly the latter. </p><p>I was deliberately slow in standing up, to give myself time to think, but my opponent clearly had no intention of allowing that. “Ready, big boy?” she growled even as she dashed forward once more, forcing me to gather my mana hurriedly, yet receive the hit before I could actually cast it. </p><p>Of course, my shield was too late only because I was hiding my skills, but that didn’t make the tip of her staff burying in my diaphragm any less painful. Yet, it prevented me from using that as an excuse to check her disguise. </p><p>[-23 HP]</p><p>The attack itself was not too damaging, as she clearly held herself back, but she more than compensated for it by choosing the potentially most powerful point to attack. </p><p>… one of the most painful, I corrected as I shifted my leg to prevent her knee from burying into the most sensitive and most important location in my body. I wanted to play along with her revenge fantasy, but I had my limits as well, and that area was at the forefront of that limits. After all, when other men said that it was their most important part, they were talking figuratively. </p><p>For me, it was literal. </p><p>Of course, defending my crotch in a timely manner didn’t come freely. She had used our closeness to deliver a backhanded slap to me, an insulting move that was also strong enough to send me tumbling away. </p><p>“What happened, big boy,” she growled vindictively. “Are you too tired?” </p><p>“Kind of,” I murmured even as I pushed myself up to my feet, putting a smile despite the pain I was feeling — even with my endurance, getting that kind of hit from a high leveled warrior, doing her best to deliver as much suffering as she could manage was not free. “Your friend had really exhausted me that morning, begging for more.” </p><p>And just like that, her anger, already burning bright, flared even more. This time, she dashed forward even more aggressively, swinging her staff even harder, mixing in occasional punches and kicks as needed, with a particular focus on my crotch. </p><p>I didn’t allow her attacks to connect where she was clearly targeting the most, but that left the rest of my body only more vulnerable to her attacks, receiving a great number of attacks. None of them were particularly effective in terms of delivering damage, yet in terms of delivering pain, they were surprisingly effective. </p><p>[-103 HP]</p><p>Maybe she had a relationship with Delia, or not-Delia, the kind Marianne and Cornelia had before my intervention, and appreciated my involvement just as much as Cornelia had appreciated it in the beginning. </p><p>It was worthy to test. </p><p>“Come on sweetie, don’t tell me you’re having appropriate relations with Delia—” I suggested even as I dodge, or more accurately, started to suggest as I tried to dodge, only to receive a hit on my face. </p><p>Yet, despite the swift hit, I didn’t notice any sudden reaction from her, suggesting that comment had missed wildly. She didn’t even react to my comment as she continued to beat me.

    "content": "<p>As I left the room, leaving the beautiful girl disguised as Delia behind, I had to suppress the temptation to swing back and see the mystery hidden behind the impressively-complicated magical disguise. It was out of character for me to leave such a mystery unattended despite the opportunity, but, ultimately, the time it took for me to discover her extraordinary disguise and changing skills stopped me. </p><p>They clearly had abilities that I was not privy to, so, any attempt to break through the veil of mystery was simply an unnecessary risk. </p><p>Instead, I returned to the room they had created for me for some more experimentation, curious whether I could create storage that could enhance Tantric mana’s ability to somehow destroy Divine Spark’s nature, to the point of weaponization. Although, with the number of magical observation methods they had integrated into the room, it was going to be a true challenge. </p><p>Such a waste, I thought even as I stepped into the laboratory. I had an impressive number of priceless equipment and materials to work with, yet I had to limit my research significantly because I was afraid of a surprise detection ward they might have placed. “What a pity,” I murmured as I washed my face, the cold water giving me the jolt I needed to focus for a day filled with hard work, experimentation, and careful espionage. </p><p> The presence of constant observation was not doubtful. Even without any hidden motive, the room was like a treasury, only less defended. I could hardly blame them for trying to protect it, or their attempt to maximize the benefit they were getting from me. </p><p>It was time to work. First, I grabbed several alloy samples, and flooded them with mana, establishing some simple strengthening enchantments on them. </p><p>[-25 Mana]</p><p>Then, I flared my mana again, triggering the device that rested in the center of the room. A rotating magical field appeared in the center of the room, a chaotic field that promised only pain for anyone that dared to step inside. The alloys floated on the surface of the device, slowly corroding and disintegrating. </p><p>It was a simple and boring experiment. I was trying to understand how certain enchantments worked on different alloys. The process was dull, because after the first set had finally disintegrated, I grabbed another set of alloys, enchanted them, and threw them to the device to be destroyed slowly. All the while, I was working on a scroll, rolled open in front of me, a quill on my hand as I took detailed notes, filling the rest of the paper with the calculations, my mind filled with numbers and formulas. </p><p>The only trick, the formulas that were keeping my mind busy weren’t the ones I was writing on the scroll in front of me. </p><p>The formulas and calculations on the paper certainly looked impressive, the kind that would challenge a magical expert with an Intelligence of twenty. Yet, for me, it was barely more than doing the sums. </p><p>The same didn’t apply to the notes I was keeping on my mind. </p><p>From a distance, it looked like I was testing the performance of the alloys under different strengthening enchantments, but in reality, some of those enchantments were cast using ordinary mana, while others had a different mixture of Tantric mana mixed into their structure. Never overwhelmingly, as I wanted to avoid the attention of any observer, but just enough to see if using Tantric mana was making any difference. </p><p>It was vital to test after my latest discovery about Tantric’s impact on different applications. I didn’t want to be ambushed by another miraculous feature. </p><p>I cycled through the different enchantments, materials, and spells to test, my mind filled with endless calculations as I tried to understand the impact of Tantric. However, after three hours of detailed experimentation, I was yet to discover anything other than Tantric was bad for casting enchantments, lacking the rigidity to carry the weight of the magical effect I desired to inject. </p><p>[+7 Craft]</p><p>When I heard a knock on the door, almost four hours after I started experimenting, I was yet to discover anything wondrous. Welcoming a break, I waved my hand and the door opened, allowing the guest to step inside.</p><p>A blonde woman, dressed in leather armor, with an exquisite sword that radiated magic on her waist. I recognized her instantly, as she was one of the handmaidens that had been accompanying the princess, but this time, she wasn’t wearing a dress but armor. </p><p>Well, at least at the surface. Without checking, it was hard to guess whether she was another disguised member sent to talk with me. </p><p>“I hope I’m not disturbing you,” she spoke, though unlike her words, her voice was sharp with a challenge. I suppressed a sudden flash of sadness as her tone reminded me of Aviada, my unlucky lover who found herself on a dangerous journey. </p><p>“I was just finishing an experiment, no worries,” I said, turning to her with a big, salacious smile, once again the reputation as a lecher creating an excellent cover. “How can I help one of the precious handmaidens of the princess? Is there an emergency, or would I have the fortune to accompany you for leisure activity?” </p><p>Her sharp frustration at being flirted with was amusing, even if I suspected it was more acting than her actual feelings. </p><p>“No,” she said, managing to keep her voice even except for a little growl that infected it, her eyes pinning me down. “I heard that Her Highness had selected you for an important mission. I just wanted to spar with someone who had been selected for such a beautiful honor.” </p><p>“As a warrior?” I said, letting a tone of dismissiveness infect my tone. There was a reason mages were valued much higher than warriors in levels as high as the twenties. It was really difficult for a warrior to compete against the sheer burst potential of a mage. </p><p>There were certain advantages of warriors, of course, particularly their extended battle performance, but in a spar without any trick, the victory was given. </p><p>“Yes, as a warrior,” she growled, doing her best to her anger at being dismissed. Unfortunately for her, it seemed she didn’t have too many acting skills, because the fakeness of her emotion was apparent. She looked angry, but it lacked the existential frustration many high-leveled pure warriors carried after being dismissed by a mage. “I want to make sure you can handle such an important mission.” </p><p>Not surprising, as with their skill modification, she wouldn’t feel that fundamental frustration of being limited by their selection. </p><p>“As you wish,” I said, enthusiastic at the opportunity. I doubted that her aim was to get an accurate understanding of my combat abilities. If that had been the case, they would have found an excuse to test them before asking me to take the mission. </p><p>Yet, considering it gave me an excuse to use unlimited magic on her to better understand their tricks, I welcomed the opportunity regardless of their objectives. </p><p>Especially since she didn’t seem to equip any magical ability to catch my tricks. </p><p>“Follow me, then,” she said as she turned and started walking, the sudden flash of satisfaction rather interesting. I wondered about the exact reason. </p><p>“So,” I murmured as I quickly caught up with her. “Don’t tell me we’re just going to have a boring spar?” </p><p>My frivolous words didn’t generate much goodwill, but they needed me too much to react to that explosively as well. “What do you have in mind?” she asked. </p><p>“Well, maybe we can have dinner together?” I asked, and it earned a sharp look, though that sharpness was nothing compared to the one that followed it after I finished my sentence. “Maybe the same kind your friend Delia had delivered in the morning.” </p><p>She said nothing, too busy containing the flare of anger. The anger was intense enough to confirm that she knew exactly what had happened during the breakfast, no doubt feeling insulted that I would ask for a similar service from her as well. </p><p>Even better, she couldn’t just admit without revealing she already knew what had happened. Her lips, staying closed, implied that she didn’t have the intention of revealing that particular nugget. </p><p>“Maybe, depends on how long you can resist,” she said, doing her best to hide her anger. “Manage to spar with me for fifteen minutes, and I’ll personally feed you dinner.” </p><p>“Deal,” I said smugly, even though inwardly, I knew it was much harder to follow that request. A high-leveled mage could defeat a high-leveled warrior easily, but an extended spar was a different deal. Most mages didn’t have my advantage of rapid mana regeneration, meaning that, in any extended combat, they were at a great disadvantage. It would have been even more pronounced in a spar, where the mage wasn’t allowed to deliver a deadly attack that would finish, allowing the warrior to be even more aggressive. </p><p>Yet, I couldn’t reject the offer without destroying the thoughtless and braggart personality I created for them. </p><p>However, as I continued to walk deeper into the building, I realized that I might have bitten a bit more than I could chew. The reason, was I had decided to kill some time by focusing on the sway of her hips, the view of them clad in a leather prison beautiful, only to receive a notification. </p><p>[+50 Experience]</p><p>Just a notification of experience. No penalties, no reductions, nothing, meaning that she had a higher level than my actual level, let alone the surface weakness I had been displaying. </p><p>It took a lot to suppress the moan that tried to force itself into my face. Clearly, a painful sparring session awaited me. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 32 Experience: 499160 / 528000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6528 / 6528 Mana: 8000 / 8000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [84/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>",

    "content": "<p>The bathroom was silent. </p><p>I had no doubt that the silence was rather uncomfortable for the two beautiful girls in the room, their gazes locked on each other, trying to process their shock. Naomi was frozen because it was not the friend she had been expecting to find in the bathroom, while Sarah was stiff because she didn’t expect to be ambushed like that, her panties around her ankles to reveal her glistening core. </p><p>Though, I had to admit, being thoroughly ignored like that despite being naked hurt my pride a bit. Luckily, not enough to sap the fun from them looking at each other with shifting expressions, each trying to decide whether to be ashamed or angry. </p><p>Of course, the simplest, and the most rational thing would have been getting angry at me, shouting and crying, maybe even landing a couple of slaps before abandoning me. But their gazes locked as they explored each other’s reactions. </p><p>It took a moment for me to realize they were waiting for the other to display the anger I had been expecting and leave, leaving themselves alone with me. Yet, as they realized the other had no intention of doing so, their gazes started to get livelier. Soon, they gained a beautiful sharp quality as they understood each other’s aim. </p><p>The silence that descended to the bathroom was beautiful. It was like a western movie, and they were two gunslingers, tense as they waited for the other to act. </p><p>Ultimately, Naomi was the first to break the silence, which surprised me. “What a nice surprise, Sarah,” she whispered, a whisper that somehow managed to carry the same tenseness despite the absurdity of her situation. </p><p>Admirably, her voice trembled only once despite her nudity. And even more, interestingly, she let her arms fall to the side as she spoke, treating Sarah to the sight of her beautiful nudity. </p><p>Sarah didn’t cover herself even from the start, but I was familiar with her expression to know that she wanted to conceal her body. She just didn’t want to lose a challenge from her friend, even a wordless one— competitiveness that had worked wonders the last night, when she visited with Carrie. </p><p>“Likewise,” Sarah said as she put her hand on her hips, taking a pose that would have been provocative even if she had been fully dressed. </p><p>With her panties as the only piece of clothing on her — which hardly counted as a proper item of clothing in the first place, let alone pooled around her ankle — it was marvelous. </p><p>I looked at Naomi, curious how she would react. I expected her to react more passively, considering her actions everywhere except exercising, and she didn’t surprise me much. Her arms crossed under her chest, which turned her pose erotic and defensive at the same time. “Well, since Carrie struck out, I decided to throw my hat on the ring.” </p><p>Sarah’s eyes widened slightly as she realized Naomi’s misconception about Carrie’s current progress, but she wasn’t exactly in a position to use that fact as a defense. “I see, and where’s that hat?” she asked, deciding that attack was the best form of defense. </p><p>“It must have been mixed with your clothes,” Naomi countered reflexively, though she took half a step back still, showing that her nerves were fraying. It was enough to make me revisit my decision to keep myself out of their fight. I put my hand on the small of her back, encouraging her to stand her ground. </p><p>Her gaze met mine, and I gave her an encouraging smile, though I couldn’t help but feel like I was really pushing my luck. </p><p>Luckily, Sarah once again proved herself an expert on angering others, the dismissive smirk she wore when she realized Naomi needed help working better than my touch. “Maybe we should go dress and have a talk,” Sarah said, her tone dismissive. </p><p>“Why?” Naomi whispered. “Can’t you handle it?” </p><p>“O-of course I can,” Sarah was quick to correct, the same habits that forced her to stay next to us while I was exploring Carrie’s beautiful body during our game exerting themselves once more, putting her in a situation she would have preferred to escape otherwise. “I was just trying to help you,” she added, louder, as she started walking, her hips shaking beautifully. </p><p>Naomi turned toward me, her beautiful eyes trembling in fear. “Maybe we should—“ she started, only for me to lean down and steal a quick kiss. </p><p>“Why?” I asked, acting unaware of the fact that she expected to see Carrie. “You knew you would find her inside once we opened the door, right? Why the sudden change?” </p><p>“I…” she whispered her voice fading as she realized she couldn’t exactly reveal that she expected to find Carrie without making the situation even more absurd. “I didn’t expect Sarah to be that forward,” she murmured, using it as an opportunity to surrender.  </p><p>“She definitely is, but I’m sure you can handle her. I trust you,” I said even as I wrapped my arm around her waist. “Of course, if you think you are too weak to handle her…” I added, letting it drag. </p><p>“Maybe…” she whispered, her confidence weakening even with my playful challenge, but when I dragged her out and she saw Sarah leaning against the sofa in a pose that was beautiful, yet too unnatural to be anything but completely intentional. “I can handle her,” she whispered, her competitiveness fueled by Sarah’s gaze. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said as I took a step back, watching as Naomi walked forward, her beautiful ass swaying erotically. </p><p>Sarah’s expression flickered as she realized her bluff had failed, but since I was behind Naomi, nothing prevented me from smirking at her dismissively, which was more than enough to inflame her competitive spirit. </p><p>The silence was deafening as Naomi walked past Sarah and sat on the sofa slowly, her body stretching beautifully in the process. Sarah growled softly as she followed her and sat next to her. They looked at each other, saying nothing. </p><p>I gave them a minute for the weird tension to build up even further, aware that the tenser they got, the more competitive they would act. And I needed their competitiveness as close to the peak as possible to convince them. Keeping my chuckle in as I walked toward them had been a great challenge, but I managed to — mostly — succeed in my self-assigned task as I sat between them. </p><p>“So, girls, anything you want to do in particular,” I asked even as I gazed at Naomi, who was busy seething in shock as she slowly got used to shock, while her competitiveness continued to build up. </p><p>Sarah was quicker to react. “Well, since Naomi arrived at the latest, we should ask her. That’s the fair thing to do since she’s the guest. A surprise one.” </p><p>Naomi was clever enough to read the subtext of Sarah’s words, not that it was particularly difficult, especially with her last words. Yet, rather than reacting immediately, she reacted in a slower manner, but it hardly made it less impactful. “You’re right,” she murmured as she stood up, only to grab my hand and pulled me up. “I don’t plan to spend a lot of time here. I just come here to ask Chad’s help to make me stretch.” </p><p>Before I could say anything, Naomi raised her leg high, putting it on my shoulder while I grabbed her leg, repeating the exact same pose we had shared earlier today during the shopping trip. </p><p>Of course, without any clothes to create a barrier, it was much more intense. And soon, Naomi’s hips started to move, which added quite a bit of extra fun to our little exercise. </p><p>“I see,” Sarah murmured, her expression tight as she watched, not bothering to hide her jealousy. “It looks rather difficult, are you sure you can handle it without ripping a … muscle.” </p><p>“It’s just exercise, nothing I can’t handle,” Naomi answered, her voice much more confident. Interesting that even under this absurd situation, she managed to get courage from exercising. “You don’t mind waiting a bit, do you?” she whispered as she added. </p><p>“I see, and how long this … exercise session would take?” Sarah said. </p><p>“I don’t know, maybe half an hour?” Naomi answered, her smirk getting wider. “You know that I have good endurance.” </p><p>\"Oh, I do,” Sarah countered, though I didn’t miss the teasing way Naomi had delivered that sentence, nor the way Sarah tensed when she heard it. </p><p>There must be an interesting story behind that if that was enough to Sarah react to it like that when Naomi was currently rubbing against my body in a way that would have forced a movie to take a late-night slot. </p><p>Sarah stood still for a moment, making me wonder whether the issue Naomi had poked was too significant, enough to ruin her mood. However, a smile soon grew on her face, one that reminded me of her attitude when we were in the pool with Carrie, and she had decided to challenge her. </p><p>Excellent, I thought. A competitive Sarah was nothing less than a treat. </p><p> “You’re right, you have a better endurance than me,” Sarah said with a wide smirk. “Maybe I should join you guys to exercise,” Sarah commented, her tone tight.</p><p>“If you think you can keep up with us,” Naomi said as she pulled her leg away from my shoulder and stepped on the floor once more, a sharp expression on her face, picking up Sarah’s challenge and answering it excellently. </p><p>Though, I doubted she was aware of the exact lengths Sarah was willing to go for that challenge. </p><p>Interestingly, that was a mystery even for me, I thought even as I felt Sarah’s fingers around my wrist, pulling me toward the couch. </p><p>I couldn’t wait to see her surprise. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

    "content": "<p>Looking at Sapphire’s wordless invitation, I was conflicted. </p><p>On one hand, I had already spent too much time dealing with her back in the cell. And while we had taken a lot of strategic decisions in the process — well, I ordered, and she accepted, but why focus on such unimportant details — I was still facing the looming presence of two mysterious enemies, both threatening to overwhelm and bury not only the Empire, but also the Dark Lands. Every single second was precious. </p><p>Yet, on the other hand, the sight of Sapphire, naked in a corridor that someone else could walk in, her legs still trembling after a spectacular evening, an incredible beauty was not something that could be ignored easily. </p><p>Even with the looming weight of the invasion. </p><p>A growl escaped my mouth as a sudden temptation hit me and I grabbed her arm, dragging her into her royal quarters harshly. </p><p>If she wanted my attention, she would get it. </p><p>With her balance ruined by her trembling legs, she would have toppled down with the slightest push, yet I pushed her hard when we arrived at one of the couches in her room, not even bothering to drag her to her bed. </p><p>Yet, as her back slammed against the seat, the only sound she made was an obedient moan, echoing beautifully in the well-decorated room. </p><p>For a moment, I stood motionless, my gaze glued to her, deliberately keeping my gaze blank and imposing — though my incredible erection was more than enough to fully show my appreciation. </p><p>Yet, as she stood silent, motionless except for her legs, widening to reveal her wet core, it was clear that my intimidating presence was working wonders on her arousal. The reddened marks on her body, particularly on her wrists, delivered by the chains around her wrists, and on her breasts, delivered by my aggressive mauling. </p><p>“Such a little obedient Queen,” I growled as I leaned forward, keeping my expression tight as I grabbed her hair, pulling her lips closer to my crotch as I positioned above her, pinning her under me. </p><p>Helpless, her lips widened to take my presence, unable to moan properly with the impediment blocking her mouth, an impediment soon moved to her throat, forcing her to let out a beautiful string of gags. “Come on, Sapphire,” I whispered, enjoying her soft gasp even as I put my hand on her breasts, adding new red marks to accompany the others. </p><p>When I pulled back to let her breathe, she shuffled it, resting her neck against the armrest, which allowed me to push even deeper into her throat without a fear. As I pushed, she raised her legs helplessly behind me, spreading wide and exposing her beauty even more. </p><p>When I pulled back after lengthy treatment, she was gasping desperately, trying to catch her breath, her physical limits catching up with her. </p><p>Yet, I didn’t give her the time she needed to recover before moving down a bit. Her eyes widened as I positioned between her legs, grabbing her thighs to create an even more favorable angle for an invasion. </p><p>Sapphire let out a gasp, followed by a deep moan as I impaled her once again.</p><p>Although I had been inside her just minutes ago, the new position gave an entirely different feeling, especially since I could push her down even harder, knowing that it wasn’t the hard, rough walls of the prison she was leaning against but the soft and expensive couch in her room worked much better to absorb the hits as I pushed deeper into her, new areas stretching in the depths of her core. </p><p>The sensation was truly incredible, as evidenced by the loudness of her moans as I started fucking her relentlessly, hard and fast, the word gentleness nowhere to be seen as my body slammed against hers over and over. </p><p>Her moans soon turned into grunts, the aggressiveness of the assault enough to break through her ability to exert even the slightest modicum of control over her voice, loud enough to hurt my poor ears. </p><p>However, a little pain was nothing compared to the glory of mercilessly dominating the Queen. It wasn’t the first time we were doing it, of course, nor it was the most spectacular place — that honor was a competition between the throne room and the treasury — but the fact that it was her own living quarters, the place that was supposed to be only for her, secure against any intrusion, gave the moment a unique feel. </p><p>Even more beautiful was her face, nothing but pleasure and pain as she did her best to take my assault without a complaint — not that it seemed to be a difficult challenge for her to abstain from complaining considering the intensity of her moans, occupying her mouth with a more priority task. </p><p>I lost myself in the incredible sensation as I started fucking her even more relentlessly, her breasts swaying under the rocking motion as her body moved back and forth, her back hitting against the armrest repeatedly thanks to the angle. </p><p>Her moans achieved the impossible, getting even louder as she immersed in the sensation, enjoying every single moment of being dominated. At that moment, she was not the Queen, nor she was an exotic dancer that enjoyed teasing men without giving the ultimate reward they searched for. </p><p>She was just a woman, enjoying the domination of her man without the slightest concern. </p><p>Her only active role was to spread her legs even wider, allowing me to push even deeper into her without the slightest obstruction, more like a magical hammer than a man, nailing repeatedly with the rhythmic power only magic could enable. </p><p>The incredible assault lasted for almost half an hour, mercilessly slamming without the slightest break, a miraculous feat that was only possible because I had cheated a little using magic, both to keep my body going, and to keep her wet. </p><p>That little magic certainly didn’t go to waste, not with the chain of climaxes that she had suffered during that period. Yet, even as I continued to drill her mercilessly, she managed to stay conscious despite her orgasms. </p><p>It wasn’t without a cost. Orgasms that left her a reddened, trembling mess, deliciously crying each second despite her cracking voice, mixing with my grunts as my hips slammed against her, fucking her incessantly.</p><p>I pulled back for a fleeting moment as I widened my legs, giving myself a better angle as I continued to slam into her, spreading her core even wider. </p><p>Yet, I couldn’t help but feel mesmerized by her determination as my dick slammed in repeatedly, every slam making her gush more than a spring. Her lips continued to wrap tight around my girth as if they were reluctant to let them go even after the rough treatment that extended. </p><p>“It’s an honor to serve you, Your Majesty,” I said, under the situation a teasing tone not necessary to highlight the mocking undertone. </p><p>Not that she was in any condition to catch that, of course, not with the pleasure blanketing her mind think enough to prevent her from understanding my words in the first place. </p><p>\"I'm cumming!\" I murmured, finally unable to reject the desire presented by her body, each second a delicious addition. </p><p>She might have been dazed with pleasure, but she proved she wasn’t completely gone by reacting to my words. </p><p>Her reaction was to raise her legs up for a moment before bending them, wrapping them around my waist, trying to pull me deeper. And her twitching arms suggested that she wanted to wrap them around me as well, but my hands on her shoulder, still pinning her down, prevented that from being the case. </p><p>Moreover, it wasn’t a strong move. With her strength sapped by pleasure, the hold on her legs was soft, easy to break through… </p><p>Not that I wanted to do that. I just continued to fuck her mercilessly, enjoying that glorious last few seconds before a spectacular explosion. Soon, my hips started convulsing, each twitch of my shaft filling her insides with a fresh dose of my seed… </p><p>That finally proved too much for Sapphire. Her moans started to lose their luster as she closed her eyes, finally surrendering to the unconsciousness under the domination of pleasure. </p><p>“Such a good Queen,” I said, unable to hide my chuckle as I looked at her, admiring that, even when unconscious, she managed to provide an amazing show. </p><p>“You deserved a proper rest,” I murmured as I lifted her in a bridal hold and carried her to her bed — and after that, since I was there, I carefully updated the wards of her residence to avoid any-last minute disaster. </p><p>And, since I couldn’t trust her to remember everything after such a spectacular encounter, I made sure to leave a note for her, reminding her to contact Valkyrie the first thing after she woke up, and order her to travel to the capital secretly. </p><p>It would be nice to see a familiar face from the past…</p>",

    "content": "<p>I didn’t bother hiding my gaze as she walked past me and lowered herself into the water, the shimmer making her beauty only more enhanced. “So, what’s our strategy?” I said as I joined in the water. </p><p>Megan looked at me condescendingly. “Come on, you should be smart enough to get that. You’re the one that’s supposed to be a genius chess player,” she said, though, despite her dismissive tone, I was aware enough to catch the embers of her anger. </p><p>She really didn’t appreciate my late arrival.  </p><p>I could have responded to her in kind, but I had a better, more fundamental way of getting under her skin. “Your fake condescension isn’t working as well as you might hope,” I answered, undermining her anger. “You should lean into your anger more if you want to be intimidating.” I let that smirk widen. “If you’re trying to look sexier by leaning the blonde bimbo stereotype, on the other hand, it’s working excellently. Go ahead.” </p><p>Megan clearly didn’t appreciate being called out while also being insulted for being a bimbo blonde — especially since it was too close to her usual fake identity. </p><p>On the other hand, it made Kim chuckle. “It’s good to finally see you dealing with an equal,” she commented. Then she turned to me, and her gaze fell to my midsection, the clear water not working particularly well to cover the sight of my erection — particularly active thanks to the stimulation of Megan’s very deliberate distortion of public attire. “Though, I doubt it was the reason you picked him to drive that your moronic ex crazy.” </p><p>Considering I was wearing a speedo, it was hard to conceal the view — not that I had anything to be ashamed of, though stating that, even in my own mind, run the risk of sounding like a narcissist. </p><p>“I don’t understand what you mean?” I answered with exaggerated innocence. “I’m sure my quick wit and great intellect is the only thing she used to pick me as a good fake-boyfriend candidate. The best way to contrast a football player, right?” </p><p>Megan clearly didn’t appreciate our teasing. “Don’t get too big for your breaches, little boy. The only reason I picked you is that you were at the right place at the right time. Nothing more.” </p><p>I had several choice answers for that, but before I could pick one, Kim interjected. “Watching you two lovebirds bicker is fun, but I have things to do, so why don’t you start giving me a few compromising poses so that we can start Operation Counter-Gossip.” </p><p>“Do I have to? It’s such an annoying chore,” I murmured, which earned a chuckle from Kim, and another angry glare from Megan. Though, I didn’t miss the way her eyes lingered on my muscular chest despite her anger, showing that I wasn’t the only one enjoying the visual feast. </p><p>“Come closer,” Megan ordered, channeling the attitude of a queen. </p><p>As much as I was trying to teach Megan that I wasn’t someone that could order around as she wished just because I agreed to help, there were some orders that I had no problems following.</p><p>Asking me to close the distance while she wore nothing but a sexy bikini certainly qualified for that exalted category. </p><p>Being a fake boyfriend came with some very interesting perks. </p><p>“So, what’s the exact plan,” I echoed earlier as I put my hand on Megan’s shoulder, enjoying the way she shivered slightly under my touch as her gaze went up and down over my body, with a particular stagger around my waist. “Do we stay tasteful, or go a bit deeper.” </p><p>She had strong willpower, but not strong enough to ignore the temptation of my touch when I was just wearing a speedo, especially when I was showing my excitement in such frank terms. And the assistance of the Seduction Trait, helping me to modulate my body language smoothly and helping my fingers to dance on her shoulders even more smoothly, certainly didn’t hurt. </p><p>“We’re going to stay tasteful. Nothing too extreme,” Megan murmured after she managed to bring her gaze back to my face. “We’re just going to have a few photos of us taken, and share them to quash the rising rumors.” </p><p>“What kind of rumors,” I asked, acting like I hadn’t already glimpsed into the social media to catch the growing gossip. “And what’s my benefit?” </p><p>“The false rumors of our lacking sex life, and your benefit is to not to have a reputation for impotence” she answered, though as she explained, she didn’t bother hiding her surprise. “Didn’t you check your phone? the social media is crawling with the gossip.” </p><p>“I’m not exactly a phone person,” I answered with a shrug, lying without blinking, which made her surprise intensify, as I had just admitted to being a vegan in a hunting convention. </p><p>On the side, however, Kim was chuckling at Megan’s reaction. </p><p>“How can you not,” Megan gasped, not even registering Kim’s laughter. “Social media is everything. One false rumor could ruin your reputation and social life forever.” </p><p>I shook my head in amusement. “Honey, do I look like someone that cares about what others think?” </p><p>It was another bald-faced lie, of course. Even if it wasn’t for the System, converting attention into actual power, I was careful about maintaining a persona. The mysterious dark thug character I had used for the chess tournament granted me some impressive benefits — albeit it was not too far away from my real personality. </p><p>Considering that was the only way I was able to maintain my scholarship, I was very much aware of the importance of the image. I just didn’t mean I would admit that to Megan, especially not when at a point that would help her argument. </p><p>“Everyone cares about their reputation,” Megan said decisively, but once again met with my indifferent shrug. Being denied an argument that she treated as a given didn’t help her mood, already spoiled after being kept waiting for an hour. </p><p>And I doubted that her friend, snickering on the side, was a source of calm. “Do you really don’t care that they are saying you have a small … thing?” she asked, trying to sound mocking, though the confidence in her beautiful eyes was clear. </p><p>Admittedly, it was not a bad strategy, as there weren’t many males, especially of college age, that were comfortable about the gossip of having a small penis. And, if she tried to use that in a different situation, it might even be effective on me. </p><p>But I was wearing a speedo, and facing a sexy blonde wearing almost nothing. The situation didn’t leave many doubts about the size, and the photographer on the side, waiting for us, suggested that it wasn’t long until the rest of the school learned that particular fact as well. </p><p>“Well… Not as much as you do to maintain your reputation,” I answered with a dismissive linger. “The masses could say whatever they please.” </p><p>Kim chose to interject at that point. “Yeah, Megan. They can say whatever they want. It’s not like our stud here will have any problem proving otherwise if it becomes absolutely necessary,” she said, a salacious smirk on her face. Pity that she was trying to annoy her friend rather than actually flirting. </p><p>“Thank you, Kim,” Megan said, frustrated. “You’re very helpful.” </p><p>“It was my pleasure,” Kim answered, the smugness in her tone suggesting it was not just an accident that she had ruined her friend’s position in the argument. </p><p>Megan, naturally, didn’t miss that aspect, but chose to focus on the present. “Is there anything wrong with the lighting, or should we change location,” she growled. “We don’t have much time, and I don’t want to start from the beginning.” </p><p>“Don’t worry, it’s perfect, we can start,” Kim said. </p><p>“Not so quick,” I interrupted. “You didn’t answer the second part of my question.” Megan looked at me blankly. “The part about my benefits, of course.” </p><p>“Isn’t quashing the rumors enough for you?” Megan said, her anger quick to return. </p><p>“Clearly not,” I answered. “So, unless you have a good way to compensate for the time we wasted…” </p><p>Megan said nothing as I let my words linger, clearly thinking about the advantages and disadvantages of complying. Yet, the frustration that was growing on her gaze suggested that she didn’t have the luxury of delaying our little shooting to bargain. </p><p>Yet, it was her friend who first spoke. “He’s right, sweetie,” she said, the cheer in her tone suggesting she was very much enjoying the show in front of her, treating it as a soap opera episode. “It’s not fair to ask him to help you without giving him a reward, is it?” </p><p>“I don’t know,” Megan murmured, clearly not appreciating her friend’s interruption. “Are you sure he needs a reward?” she added, though I caught the tenseness in her tone, suggesting her friend not to push her.  </p><p>“Definitely,” Kim answered, though her smirk suggested she caught that implication, and chose to ignore it.</p><p>“Alright,” Megan said vindictively. “Kim will go on a date with you!” </p><p>Kim beat me to a reaction. “I will?” she said, surprised. </p><p>“Yes, I’m calling my favor,” Megan said victoriously. “You shouldn’t have mocked me.” </p><p>Her friend said nothing, frozen at the sudden reversal. She was clearly not pleased, though I wondered whether it was about being saddled to date with me, or just losing the initiative. If it was the former, it wasn’t the greatest ego boost, after all. </p><p>Still, since I was not a complete moron, I said nothing, letting them deal with their issues. As much as angering the photographer didn’t seem like a smart idea, I wasn’t at a point to understand the intricacies of their friendship. </p><p>“As you wish,” Kim said, nodding in acceptance despite her displeasure.</p><p>“Shall we start?” I finally said, feeling safe enough to interrupt. “I still have an important tactical meeting to prepare.” </p>",

    "content": "<p>The facility of the swimming team was a fair distance away from the museum, and combined with the important nature of my work back in the museum, consuming a significant portion of my time, I was almost an hour late for the facilities. </p><p>Much to Megan’s fury, as she had informed me with several passive-aggressive text messages. </p><p>It wasn’t entirely shocking that I got lost trying to find the facilities of the swimming team, as despite what the school had claimed in the recruiting posters, sports didn’t exactly play a big part in the life of the students. </p><p>That didn’t apply to football and basketball, naturally, but every other sport might as well be invisible as far as the students were concerned. </p><p>As I pulled into the parking lot, I glanced at the building, realizing that it wasn’t the student popularity that they had been struggling with. It would be an exaggeration to say that the facility was in ruins, as it was still leagued better than the inner-city public high school I had the displeasure of attending, but it lacked the shiny and polished feeling the football stadium radiated. </p><p>Maybe it was an unfair comparison, as the football stadium was certainly good enough to compete with the professional ones — and that devoured a not-so-significant portion of the budget. With that, the state of the facilities wasn’t exactly shocking.  </p><p>As I stepped out of the car, however, I had ignored the implications of the sports budget allocation and focused on the present. </p><p>Megan was waiting for me, the curl of her lips suggesting that her anger was burning hotter than the engine of her beautiful red convertible. “You’re late,” she growled. “Where have you been! I’m here for almost an hour, waiting for you.”  </p><p>I had to admit, her anger made an impressive display, though I deliberately didn’t give any indication that it was working on me. Despite the fiction around the idea, I was not her boyfriend, which meant she couldn’t push me around as she wished. </p><p>And, with her fists resting on her shins to display her anger, it was not without its perks. For once, she leaned forward, enhancing her cleavage. More importantly, with her fists carelessly pressing to her sides, the skirt she was wearing — already short enough to create a nice view — was pulling up, giving me a glimpse of her thighs, reminding me of the time that they had been around me as she rocked mercilessly on my lap. </p><p>Too bad that had lasted too short. </p><p>“If you actually bothered to wait for my answer, you would have heard my full explanation. I had an urgent thing to handle first before, things more important than whatever little popularity crisis you’re facing.” </p><p>“You—“ she gasped, ready to deliver an explosive response, but she was interrupted. </p><p>Not by me, but by a friend of hers. “I like him,” said a beautiful figure as she opened the passenger-side door, revealing a sexy redhead. A beautiful face, a lithe body, interrupted by surprisingly enticing curves despite their relatively modest size. </p><p>“You like him, after he made us wait for an hour,” Megan growled as she turned to her friend, her distaste clear. </p><p>“I do. He’s not as spineless as the other one, at least,” the redhead answered as she swayed her head, her hair spilling on her shoulders. As she did so, I glanced at her clothing, surprised that she was Megan’s friend. With faded black jeans, a leather jacket, and dark makeup, she didn’t like the kind of girl I expected Megan to have as a friend. </p><p>Yet, Megan’s aggressive yet unguarded reaction to her words suggested not only they were friends, but also they were good friends. </p><p>“Well, I give you that, he’s not as horrible as that egoistical waste of space,” Megan answered, unable to admit that I came up when compared with Kevin. </p><p>Unfortunately, it was hardly the most appealing comparison in the first place in terms of personality. </p><p>Still, as much as the discussion was pointless, it distracted Megan from her display of anger, while I used the opportunity to examine her friend more. I could see that under her leather jacket, she wore a simple white t-shirt, but I had a feeling that it was one of the simple t-shirts that still cost hundreds of dollars. </p><p>Rebellion, trust fund edition. </p><p>“So, were you serious—“ the redhead started, her smile wide, with a suggestive glance toward me. </p><p>“Not now, Kim!” Megan interrupted with a growl, though I caught a subtle blush on her face. Then, she looked at me. “I don’t have time to deal with you,” she added as she threw a small bag at me. “Just put this on, and join us in the pool. We have a lot of work to do.” </p><p>With that, she turned and left. Her friend followed, though not without turning back and winking at me playfully, amused at her friend’s reaction. </p><p>I followed them, giving myself a moment to enjoy the sway of their hips with each step, still putting a show in this situation — more as a habit than a genuine attempt, I noted, as I remembered the amazing show Megan had managed to put during the party. </p><p>Still, her weaponization approach to seduction was certainly deserving of respect. </p><p>Only when they disappeared from the view by taking a different turn, did I remember to check the bag? At first, I was about to turn back, as the bag looked empty. But, before I could turn back, I noticed a little piece of fabric on the bottom of the bag. </p><p>“Damn,” I murmured as I pulled it up, my eyes widened in shock. </p><p>A speedo. </p><p>“You better have a good way to pay me back,” I murmured as I continued to walk, frustrated. I was confident in my body, but speedos were hardly the height of the fashion. </p><p>Pity that I needed the popularity the gossip would bring. </p><p>After a quick stop at the dressing room, I was at the poolside, wearing nothing but the restrictive speedo. </p><p>The pool was thankfully empty, though this time, my satisfaction didn’t just come from self-consciousness about wearing a speedo. No, I had a feeling that the emptiness of the pool was arranged by Megan because it was needed for her plans. </p><p>And the fact that it was a necessary part suggested some really interesting things. </p><p>Kim walked first. And, unfortunately, she was still mostly dressed. Her leather jacket was gone, but she was still wearing her shirt and her jeans. In her hands, there was a large camera, the kind that shouted professional — or an enthusiastic amateur with lots of money.  </p><p>“Hello, tiger,” she said, her smile wide as she dragged her gaze from top to bottom, not bothering to hide her carnal perspective. “You clean up nice. I can see why Megan decided you as a fake boyfriend.” </p><p>I just smiled with a shrug, letting my body speak for itself for a moment. “It’s a bit rude, isn’t it?” I asked. </p><p>“What’s rude?” </p><p>“The way you dressed, of course. Here am I, undressed for your hungry gaze. The least you can do is to return the favor.” </p><p>That earned a chuckle. “There’s no way I’ll walk around in a swimsuit,” she said. </p><p>“It doesn’t have to be a swimsuit,” I answered, my voice suggestive enough to imply nudity.</p><p>“Megan said that you were bad, but she didn’t say just how bad,” she said, cute laughter that contrasted the rough attitude she was trying to sell. </p><p>Before I could answer, however, Megan entered, destroying my remaining concerns about our little operation not being as fun as I expected.</p><p>The way she dressed was more than enough to correct that. </p><p>She was wearing a white swimsuit, certain parts of it thin enough to double as dental floss. The top consisted only of some thin string, and two tiny triangles that were barely big enough to cover her nipples, even a hint of areola peeking through their deficient coverage. </p><p>Its white color, bright enough to give an impression of transparency, hardly helped to sell an impression of modesty.  </p><p>Her bottoms, in contrast, had a much bigger triangle, covering everything that mattered, even though it still sold the impression that all it would take was a small accident to create a scandal. </p><p>At least, that was what I thought until she took a step forward, and I caught the reflection of her back from a mirror, where any kind of triangle was deliciously absent, the task of hiding her perky bottom trusted to a piece of string. </p><p>A task that the string failed spectacularly, revealing her sculpted ass to my hungry gaze. </p><p>I didn’t bother hiding my lecherous smile. “Next time, start with a picture of you in this swimsuit. You’ll be surprised how quickly I’ll arrive.” </p><p>“You’re lucky that we’re facing an emergency. Or…” she said, letting her voice drop down in a threatening manner. I had to admit, that the fact that she was able to actually look intimidating while wearing that tiny piece was nothing less than a miracle. </p><p>Her plan was getting clearer, much to my satisfaction… </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

    "content": "<p>Escaping from a base that was clearly designed to keep a sorceress prisoner — and was over-designed for that purpose — was a sufficiently tense affair without turning my back on said sorceress’ blackmail that was the reason I was in said prison in the first place. </p><p>Yet, I turned my back to her and started walking, the tenseness better than displaying fear. It was a risk I needed to take for the future of our relationship. “Keep your magic suppressed,” I ordered to my unwilling companion as I took another step. </p><p>“I don’t appreciate your tone,” she whispered, though that didn’t prevent her from following me. Clearly, her lack of appreciation was shadowed by her dissatisfaction with her living conditions. </p><p>“And I don’t appreciate being blackmailed, but here we are, beautiful. Grow up. We can’t get everything we want from life.” </p><p>“But—“ she started, but I interrupted her. </p><p>“Feel free to ask one of your other sorcerer friends who’s also an expert on wards and runes to save you if you’re feeling slighted,” I answered tersely. “Oh, wait!” However, despite the sharpness of my word, it was not just an angry rant, but a little trick to show my displeasure, trying to set expectations that I wouldn’t be catering to every single whim of hers just because I needed her help. </p><p>That earned an angry glare from my guest, though, luckily, she suppressed her magic as she did so, showing that she wasn’t the type to pointlessly escalate the situation. With that, we finally stepped into the corridor, leaving the last major ward that still belonged to her cell. </p><p>Leaving only the need to leave the prison protected by active wards, and defended by hundreds of mind-controlled soldiers, forced to be attentive and loyal at the same time.</p><p>Simple, right.</p><p>I carefully expanded my magic, trying to make sure there were no guards close. Seeing that there were none, I turned my attention back to the cell, making a couple of additions that would provide the person that opened the door with the biggest surprise of their life. </p><p>“Can’t you integrate those traps into the wards more,” my ‘guest’ commented as I pulled my magic? “Anyone with the magical sensitivity of a snail would catch them.” </p><p>“Not if you don’t want to trigger those wards and bring all the guards to our presence,” I answered. </p><p>“But what’s the point, any half-decent mage would notice those traps on the door if they check it properly.” </p><p>“That assumes that it would be a mage that opens the door, and not an ordinary guard,” I explained. I certainly didn’t appreciate someone questioning even the simplest move I was making, but I wasn’t in a position to teach about the rudeness of her actions as well. Not with a lot more to be done. Instead, I stayed still for a moment while tracing the direction of the wards, trying to find the center where they were managing the wards. </p><p>Luckily, finding that location was not difficult — another reason why making inward-facing active wards wasn’t the best idea. It gave another easy target to be taken down — relatively easy. </p><p>Though, it didn’t take long for me to correct that particular thought, because as I traced the magical direction toward the center, I had met with another set of active wards, this time facing outward. </p><p>My eyes widened. A layer of active wards was already excessive, but creating a second one to protect the center of the first one was certainly a lot — especially since it wouldn’t protect the controller against more indirect interventions as my initial infiltration had proved. </p><p>Yet, if I wanted to get out without an alarm, my best option was to break through that second ward and prevent the ward managers from controlling. </p><p>“Follow me,” I said as I expanded my mana carefully once more, once again splitting my attention, using it to find any guard that might be patrolling while simultaneously camouflaging us. Still, I was lucky that they didn’t post any guards to her cell. My guess was that they were afraid of her somehow breaking the mental tricks — which, considering her healing expertise, wasn’t exactly impossible. </p><p>As we walked, I started passing more guards sleeping in their beds. Yet, there were three differences. One, they weren’t living in crowded rooms, each assigned to a solitary bedroom. Two, each was radiating magic enough to mark them as mages, impressively strong considering the power that was radiating off them. </p><p>Three, the number of mind-manipulating wards woven in the rooms was overwhelming. </p><p>“Do you have any idea how they don’t get mad with that many wards?” I asked. </p><p>“Who told you that they don’t?” she asked. “The experiments I showed you are not the only reason I’m a ‘guest’ in this place.” She flared her magic, isolating three wards on the structure of the mages. “Without these three suppressing their madness, it would take only hours for them to get crazy.” </p><p>“Oh, really,” I said even as I stretched my magic, smoothly sabotaging the ones that she had pointed to. “Any idea why they are relying on such unreliable guards.” </p><p>“Who told you they are guards?” she said with a scoff. “They are just experiments.” </p><p>That made much more sense, I realized as I considered every single security measure. Yet, before I could comment on that, we had arrived at the control center, eight guards standing at the entrance, alert and ready to launch. </p><p>Luckily, not enough to notice us behind the layer of camouflaging magic. </p><p>“Do you want me to deal with them?” she asked. </p><p>“Go ahead,” I said. It was a risky move to trust her to do so without alerting them, but I was willing to take that risk to get a better understanding of her abilities. After all, she should have a reason to take the initiative in such a manner. </p><p>I watched as her magic spread slowly, barely a wisp wrapping around the guards — none of them a mage unless they were suppressing their aura. The effect wasn’t immediate, but I watched as their attentive expression slowly disappear, and they turned dazed and bored. </p><p>At first, I thought that it was just another sleeping spell, but her wisp of magic was interacting with their minds in a different manner. It took a while for me to realize she was unraveling the changes that were made by the wards, and with those gone, their alertness had been reduced significantly. </p><p>Enough to fail to raise the alarm when she followed up with a sleeping spell. </p><p>“Impressive,” I said as I looked at her smug expression. It wasn’t the most time-efficient way of dealing with a bunch of ordinary guards, but it was a good way to keep her mana presence limited, especially since they were just a couple of feet away from the active ward that would catch any big flare. </p><p>“I know,” she said, not bothering to hide her smugness. Her act was also an excellent way to show that, even as a healer, she was still a sorceress, with all the danger that implied.  </p><p>“Now it’s my turn,” I answered. Luckily, I didn’t need to make a choice between being efficient and showy. I had no choice buy being showy against an active ward. “Just repeat the trick on any guard that comes close, I need the time.” </p><p>I shifted my position several times around the corridor, carefully carving several runes in a complicated pattern, carefully fueling every single one. Her presence was fortunate, because, without her assistance to keep the guards away, I would have needed to split my attention between powering the runes — subtly enough not to alert the mage managing the ward — and the patrols. </p><p>The web of runes I created started gathering energy, a ray of light hobbling between them, though despite the visual show, its magical presence stayed hidden, concealed by the other runes I had created. And, as I added more and more runes, the ray of light between them gained strength slowly, the pale light casting a strange hue on us. </p><p>My unwilling partner sent me a suspicious glance, clearly not expecting such a comprehensive structure, her gaze showing she didn’t understand my ultimate aim. Yet, she didn’t ask a question, so I kept my mouth shut as well, ignoring her wordless question. </p><p>If she was curious, she could always ask. </p><p>What I was doing was excessive even against an active ward. There were three layers. The inner layer was there to hide the magical presence of the runes from the controller before they could react, and the middle layer was the main weapon to break the ward before they could raise the alarm. </p><p>The interesting addition was the outer layer. They existed to hide the aura of my assault from outside, but not directly like the inner layer. </p><p>Hiding a direct assault in progress was different than hiding the runes. Concealing logs in the darkness was one thing. </p><p>Concealing them when they were on fire was something else. </p><p>Yet, this time, the enemy gave me the tool I needed to conceal that explosion in their obsession to create several layers of security to their secret experimentation location. </p><p>“Be ready,” I warned my dubious ally as I started gathering my magic… </p>",

    "content": "<p>I acted like I missed the sudden sharpness not-Delia’s gaze as I leaned forward, pressing my lips against her wetness. A guttural moan escaped her throat despite her best effort, throaty and rich, the kind that would have awakened my arousal if that task hadn’t been already completed by her unlimited beauty. </p><p>When she looked me back again, after half a minute where she did her best to watch the ceiling, her face was marked with frustration. </p><p>Not the frustration of disappointment. Even if I was keeping my abilities restricted to avoid any pesky suspicion that might ruin my plan,  her disappointment would have hurt my little fragile male pride. </p><p>Luckily, it wasn’t that particular flavor, but a more familiar kind of frustration, the kind that a beautiful lady carried while she tried to keep her moans of pleasure suppressed despite her body begging for a release of the pressure. </p><p>An expression that I was intensely familiar with. </p><p>I had been thinking about pulling back to ask my questions again about the mission she was trying to push for me, but seeing just how decisive she was as she was trying to keep her moans down, I decided to stay once more. Teasing my mysterious adversary was just too tempting to reject. </p><p>And it wasn’t like my current task was an unbearable chore. </p><p>Watching a beautiful busty blonde twist and squirm under my tongue was always a pleasure, so I let my tongue dance aggressively around her knob, each twirl designed to trigger a soft moan off her beautiful lips. Yet, she managed to defy that order for a time long enough to give me a surprise. </p><p>Yet, five minutes of dedicated assault was enough to finally break her determination, and a moan escaped her beautiful lips, signaling the perfect opportunity to ask questions about the mission. </p><p>I continued licking her delicious core. </p><p>Her moans continued, only to be interrupted by question a couple minutes later. “Weren’t you about to ask me questions … about the mission,” she whispered, her voice tense with pleasure. </p><p>I raised my head, just enough to catch her expression, a beautiful mixture of anger and pleasure hidden behind a fake layer of confusion, one that she doubtlessly expected to trick me. </p><p>“Well, I was, but since you seem to be so determined keeping it a secret, I decided to respect your decision,” I said, though considering my hands were still on her thighs as I said that, pushing her legs wide, it was hardly the most convincing argument. Luckily, we were currently not in a position that required a flexible tongue. </p><p>A metaphorical flexible tongue, of course, as the literal flexibility was much more important as I leaned down once again to tease her wetness with maddeningly rhythmic brushes. </p><p>Pity I couldn’t watch her expression simultaneously, though the way her body was trembling had given me enough material to imagine  the way it flickered, her mouth open, her tongue flickering out to moisten her lips repeatedly. </p><p>Of course, I wasn’t completely impervious of the effects of my actions as well. My cock was throbbing at this point, imprisoned helplessly in my pants, enough to make me consider freeing them. Yet, I suppressed that desire, as getting naked would make her think that I was pushing for the next stage. </p><p>A stage that she was clearly not ready yet. </p><p>So, I continued, amused by the plight I had forced myself in. I continued teasing her core, doing my best to push her to a climax. Under my skilled assault — even if it was limited enough to maintain my false facade — it didn’t take long for her to start trembling intensely, providing me with the telltale signs of a beautiful climax.</p><p>The kind that rewarded my efforts with a sweet explosion. </p><p>Yet, even as she started breathing hard to get rid of the after-effects of her climax, I didn’t give her any space to recover, my tongue continuing its assault with a renewed passion, almost reaching the point of displeasing. Luckily, I knew exactly where to stop to her torture sweet and beautiful, the discomfort staying the kind that would maintain its unique nature. </p><p>After all, I had the pride of an expert… </p><p>It didn’t take long for her to realize that I had no intention of stopping, so, I watched as she raised her head, barely able to look me into her eye as she tried to limit the signs of frustrated pleasure behind a fake layer of euphoria. </p><p>“M-maybe I could give you a few clues about the mission,” she stammered. </p><p>Trying to watch her as she tried to hide an expression of pleasure behind another expression of pleasure was amusing, even though I didn’t underestimate the nature of her actions. She was doing her best to hide her frustration by a layer of euphoria, because she wanted me to believe that she was speaking because I had managed to extract that from her. </p><p>Meaning, she was already planning to share that information beforehand. </p><p>“Before we left the capital, a precious amulet of Her Highness had been lost to the sticky fingers of a thief, and she needs someone to retrieve it. It’s precious, because it’s one of the few gifts the late Queen had bequeathed to her before her unfortunate demise.” </p><p>“Hmm,” I said even as I pulled my head back, but still, I kept my fingers over her core, dancing at the entrance softly, not letting the assault lessen. “And should I assume the Princess wants me to travel to the Capital to find among the rats that skulk in the shadows.” I pushed my chest out proudly. “I’m a great mage, not someone that could suffer the insult dealing with that kind of rats. And if that lazy—“ I started, before forcibly correcting my words, suggesting that I was drunk enough to almost insult the Princess in front of her loyal servant before correcting myself. </p><p>“And if Her Highness thinks that I would do such a thing, she’s mistaken,” I corrected myself, trying to force a respectful tone, but deliberately adding a sharp undertone to show a wounded pride. </p><p>It was as intentional as her attempt to look lost in pleasure. It wasn’t the first time, but I wanted to remind both her and the Princess that I was too prideful, to the point of being easily manipulated. </p><p>Giving a false weakness was much better than letting them searching for a real weakness. </p><p>Who knew what they might find if they started skulking around? </p><p>“Don’t worry, Her Highness respects you immensely. You’re not only a great mage, but also a great blacksmith that could create miracles with nothing but his mana and his hands. How could she just send you deal with that kind of riffraff. No, her agents managed to track the location of the item.” </p><p>“Better,” I said. “Do you have any idea where? I can’t help her if it’s in a distant location. I have important tasks I have to handle in the school, and I doubt the Princess could convince the headmistress to allow a leave longer than a day.” </p><p>“Unfortunately—“ she started, only for a moan to escape as I flicked her knob, my fingers steadily working on her entrance to push her deeper into the pleasure. “Unfortunately, I don’t know where it is, but I’m sure Her Highness would meet you to explain. May I—“ she continued, only to be interrupted by another moan as my fingers twisted beautifully. </p><p>“May you, what?” I asked mockingly even as I looked at her face, amused by the flicker of annoyance that climbed to the surface before drowning among the waves of pleasure. </p><p>There were certainly perks to the role I was playing, especially with the excuse of being drunk enough to be reckless. </p><p>“May I tell Her Highness that you accept the mission? I’m sure she would reward you immensely.” </p><p>“You may, as long as she can give me enough reward to make it worth my time, of course,” I said, seemingly dismissively as I leaned down once more to press my tongue against her wet core for a bit more, before pulling back. </p><p>“I’m willing to meet with the Princess whenever it’s convenient for her,” I said as I stood up, deliberately leaving her on the edge. A little punishment for her daring. It might have been constituted as out-of-character for my role as the arrogant mage, so I decided to add one last sentence before leaving. </p><p>“And if you want to continue our … discussion…” I said, letting my smirk gain a salacious yet confident reflection. “Feel free to visit my room. I would appreciate the opportunity to take a break.” </p><p>With that, I left the room, leaving a sexy, naked blonde panting as she lay on the table.  </p><p>Though, despite my words, I was yet to truly accept that mission. The reason, the subtle smile of victory that danced on her lips, reminding me of an assassin that successfully sank a dagger in the heart of her target.</p><p>A reaction that was more intense than I had expected from a servant. </p><p>Even more interestingly, even as that expression passed through her face, her eyes lost their focus, suggesting that it wasn’t me that she was stabbing. </p><p>I was just the dagger… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 32 Experience: 499110 / 528000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6528 / 6528 Mana: 8000 / 8000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [77/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>",

    "content": "<p>The sensation that immediately followed the realization that I had been tricked was an interesting feeling. A part of that was no doubt unpleasant, like being hit by a surprise water attack without the slightest hint. </p><p>Yet, just like water hitting one’s face in the middle of a hot summer day, it was invigorating. With everything that was happening, I was starting to believe that, at least in Silver Spires, everything was under my control. And being wrong on that aspect was dangerous, but there was one thing certain. </p><p>It was not boring. </p><p>As I continued kissing her, I carefully examined the structure that kept her face hidden, careful not to disrupt the structure, trying to understand the difference it had caused. </p><p>The first thing I noticed when I expanded the energy was that her face wasn’t the only thing that was behind that disguise. Her body was also affected. The good news was the changes were pretty minimal, just enough to bring me a particular memory. </p><p>The princess, stepping out of her carriage with four other handmaidens, each looking eerily similar. </p><p>Maybe there was more to the princess’ choice of handmaiden than just aesthetics. It would certainly help to use them interchangeably depending on the situation, especially with the freedom to adjust their skills. </p><p>I wondered which of the four handmaiden’s mouths I was currently ravaging mercilessly, before pulling back a few seconds later, giving her a chance to catch her breath. For a given value of pulling back, as one of my hands still lingered on her back, preventing her from moving back, while the other was still on her breast, caressing and squeezing in equal measures. </p><p>To her credit, even under the assault of pleasure, she managed to keep her objective in mind. “About my request…” she whispered. </p><p>“Yes,” I murmured before leaning forward, stealing a lingering kiss from her neck. “About your request…” </p><p>“We need a little help, from a brave soul who’s proficient in combat. Someone better than the average soldiers in our employ.” </p><p>“Oh, I would have thought the Royal Procession would have enough elite soldiers to handle such a threat?” I said, though made sure to sound like I was making a dig rather than an actual question, while still forcing her to explain. </p><p>“We have good soldiers, but true elite… They are hard to find, and even harder to convince,” she answered, her voice beautifully gaspy, the way she gently caressed my cheek leaving no doubt about exactly what she had been talking about. </p><p>It caught my attention, leaving me curious about the reason for going that much effort into just asking for some military assistance. One thing was certain. The explanation she implicitly gave, that it was just a regular mission from the Princess, was a lie. </p><p>If I wasn’t aware of their unique ability to change their skills, adapting to their need, I might have believed that they lacked a true combatant even after seeing the impressive performance of their thief, but knowing that they have a modular ability to adjust their skills, that was clearly not the case. </p><p>Which meant that the situation wasn’t as simple as requiring a strong combatant. It could be a personal plan from Delia — or not-Delia, if we were being accurate — trying to use me for a personal project without asking the Princess, though I didn’t believe that.</p><p>A part of that was the fact that she had optimized her skills before arriving. And while it was technically possible that whatever they were using to change their skills was something they could use without alerting the Princess, it wasn’t very possible. </p><p>They wouldn’t let such a dangerous strategical tool casually accessible. </p><p>And, even if changing her skills without asking the Princess was possible, she wouldn’t have handled that operation in Delia’s room, when all the guards had noted my presence here. Not the most concealed way.  </p><p>Which meant the operation was approved by the Princess, and they wanted me to handle a mission that they could do themselves. I was sure they could do it themselves. I didn’t have any indication that they were as strong as me, but they were certainly stronger than the strength and combat capability I had displayed for them as one of the ancillary members of the headmistress’ team.</p><p>Maybe it was the danger, so they preferred to send a nominal ally than one of their members. Technically, I might have assumed the critical work they had assigned me would be enough to remove the possibility of a betrayal — but the more I learned about their interesting disguise abilities and fake skills, the less I trusted that possibility. </p><p>Their ability was not limitless. If that was the case, they wouldn’t have bothered to reach out to an expert for their crafting process. However, my own experience with crafting and magic gave me the reason why they did, coming up with a design from the scratch using a ruined artifact was not a simple affair. </p><p>Modifying a design from a working starting point, however, was much simpler. </p><p>Of course, sacrificing myself in a desperate mission was not the only possibility. There were many other possibilities, including the fact that the attack might be a perfectly ordinary mission, and they were using it as an excuse to pull me tighter into their faction, but without more information, it was impossible to determine. </p><p>Luckily, the source of information was too far away. “Hmm, tell me about this mission,” I asked her, but rather than listening carefully, I leaned forward to catch her nipple between my lips, my tongue lashing out freely. </p><p>“It— it’s a secret before you accept it,” she whispered. “But it’s not dangerous.” </p><p>“Of course, it’s not dangerous,” I bragged as I pulled back to play the role of a drunk perfectly, leaving the task of teasing her nipples to my fingers momentarily. “I’m the greatest mage this school has ever seen. Nothing can threaten me. But I’m curious about the reason for it.” </p><p>“Still—“ she started, only to explode into another moan as my mouth returned to its primary task, this time with the assistance of my teeth, leaving a nice mark on her breast. “I can’t talk about the mission before I get the approval of the Princess, and bring the news of your agreement. The mission is too vital.” </p><p>“Hmm,” I whispered. “Still, I’m sure there’s no harm giving me a few details off the record, right? Like what kind of enemy that I need to kill. Monsters, undead, enemy warriors? Give me something, beautiful.” </p><p>“I’m sorry,” she managed to say between her moans as my fingers continued mounting their assault on her beautiful breasts, testing their spectacular sensitivity to the limit. “But my lips are sealed. I can’t betray the secrets of the Princess.” </p><p>Interestingly, despite everything, I managed to catch a hint of amusement in her tone. For some reason, those last words were clearly a joke, one that was impressive enough to get a place in her voice even as she was moaning repeatedly. </p><p>Pity I had bigger priorities than understanding that particular humorous note, such as interrogating her. </p><p>In an enhanced manner. </p><p>Suddenly, without a warning, I put my arm on the table, and swept all the dishes to the side. And as the crash of the broken porcelain reached my ear, I was busy pushing her on the table, the slit of her dress giving me an easy way to rip the rest of that beautiful dress off her body, leaving her completely naked. </p><p>“Oh, I’m sure I could get at least a small hint off you, enough to count as a favor to a good friend, at least,” I whispered even as I put my hands on her legs, parting her legs. </p><p>I felt a hint of panic off her, only to disappear when I leaned forward, bringing my lips nearer to her nether ones. She was clearly unwilling to take that full step for her mission, but had no problems with some oral assistance. </p><p>How cute. </p><p>“I … can’t,” she murmured, but one that was tinged with tenseness and anticipation at the same time as I completed my small journey, my tongue touching against her knob, dancing softly. The moan that escaped her pouty lips was simply phenomenal. </p><p>“Come on, Delia,” I said after a few brushes even though I knew it was not her name. “Just a hint. A word of clue. A little gift between friends. What’s the harm.” </p><p>I glanced at her as she put her elbows on the table and propped up her torso a bit, allowing her to look for me. And, as an added benefit, it enhanced the already spectacular view her breasts were providing even further. </p><p>Yet, the sharp gaze she had displayed as she studied me through narrowed eyes and thick, long lashes was even more arousing. It was a challenge, a signal of rebellion, one that triggered my instincts to break that rebellion through pleasure, making her mewl for hours and hours until she had turned into an obedient servant. </p><p>Pity that was not an option with the character I was playing. Even my current actions were pushing the envelope. </p><p>The magical drunkenness was an excuse, but only up to a certain point. </p><p>I wondered if she was aware of just how attractive her gaze was, enough to make me consider abandoning my plans to play the overconfident patsy. If it wasn’t for the latest discoveries about the disguise that suggested their faction was even more mysterious than their ability to modify their skill selection, I might have actually abandoned the ploy to test just how much effort it would take to erase that particular expression from her beautiful face. </p><p>The expression was attractive, because unlike everything else, it was not an act, but a reflection of her true feelings, her true core, making it a thoroughly maddening addition to our game. </p><p>Just the thing I needed to make our game entertaining….</p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 32 Experience: 499110 / 528000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6528 / 6528 Mana: 8000 / 8000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [77/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>",

    "content": "<p>“H-how is this,” Penny murmured as I turned my attention to her, whose beautiful face once again glowing with a shy blush as she stood at the entrance, visible even in the dimness of the room. </p><p>This time, she wore a robe to cover her beautiful body, though it was only true for a rather loose definition of the concept of coverage. The robe was of a half-kimono type dress than a proper bathrobe, designed to be sexy and alluring rather than to protect the maximum amount of skin. </p><p>And, most importantly, it was designed to fit sexily a petite woman, one that had neither Penny’s height nor her beautiful curves. </p><p>On her voluptuous body, the robe barely went low enough to cover her ass, and that was under the condition that she stood completely still, a careless step enough to reveal everything that the robe tried to keep hidden. Nor it was large enough to be successfully tied around her body despite her best effort, the red ribbon still peeking underneath. </p><p>Normally, such an ill-fitting item of clothing would have created an unappealing view. The material of the robe prevented that from being the case. It was made of some kind of soft satin, melding around her body completely, looking like it was painted on, leaving no room for the imagination. </p><p>Not that I needed that to imagine the body underneath, but the view certainly helped. </p><p>Ironically, the robes for men were much looser, comfortably wrapping around me. </p><p>“Give me a twirl, beautiful,” I said as I took a sip from the scotch, enjoying the sight as she shuffled her weight uncomfortably. If it wasn’t for her earlier, even more daring, costume, I would have assumed she was feeling self-conscious about revealing her body, but with that, I was more inclined to assume it was about her fledgling confidence in her clothing, especially after her previous attempt fell short. </p><p> She followed my request and gave a little twirl, confirming my guess about her robe's limited capability to keep her bottom covered. “Delicious enough to feast,” I whispered, which made a smile bloom to replace her hesitancy. </p><p>“Now, give me a show that’s worthy of your clothing,” I said even as I grabbed my camera, taking a quick shot of her beauty. </p><p>“R-right now,” she murmured as she grabbed the sash to tighten it further, her hesitancy returning with a vengeance. The soft flash exploded, eroding some of that hesitancy, and a sharp glare was enough to destroy the rest of the attitude, awakening her beautiful obedience once more. </p><p>She took a step forward, the thin material shuffling around her body to give an even more beautiful glimpse of her body, her long legs completely exposed, displaying their stunning beauty as her muscles contracted. The muscle movement wasn’t as obvious as she lacked a dancer’s physique — not that it was a problem. Losing her curves for that would certainly be a poor trade-off. </p><p>I was busy taking another immortal record of her beautiful curves, each shy step bringing her closer. As an added bonus, the sash of her robe was clearly too soft to hold against the pressure of her curves as she moved, each step making the gaping opening in front of her wider, showing off her body further. </p><p>She tried to fix it a couple of times to hide some more of her legs, but ultimately, it was useless. </p><p>When she stood in front of me, I delivered another surprise, turning on soft yet rhythmic music. “Why don’t you show me just how well you can dance?” I suggested. </p><p>“I — I’m not a good dancer,” she muttered, but under my sharp gaze, she started swaying to the music without further complaint. It turned out that her words were not a modest brag, but the truth. She was truly a deficient dancer, failing to follow the simplistic rhythm of the music. </p><p>Yet, ironically, her clumsy dance somehow worked perfectly with her cute face, reminding me of a raunchy yet cute scene from a 60s movie. Of course, that was only possible due to her spectacular beauty combined with her unique brand of innocence. </p><p>“You’re doing more than alright, sweetie,” I murmured. “Just close your eyes, and let the music take you.” </p><p>She said nothing, just trusting my words to close her eyes, continuing to sway with the music. After a few more photos, I put the camera on the side, and gave my full attention to her dance. The number of interesting poses I could find without standing up or aggressively micromanaging her pose was limited. </p><p>And at the moment, I wanted to enjoy her show without interruption. </p><p>For a while, I just sat as she did her approximation of dance, her robe slowly slipping more and more, revealing the gift wrap underneath properly while I busied myself throwing appreciative looks at her. I had a feeling that, if I put my hand on her pulse, I would find it thumping with all the wildness of a hummingbird. </p><p>I managed to suppress that desire, letting her sway ineptly under the constant thumping of the music, the robe getting more and more useless — at least in terms of the coverage it provided. </p><p>As a tool to enhance her allure, it was working spectacularly. </p><p>I doubted that her thoughts were too far away from the same track, not with her nipples hardening to the limit, pushing against the ribbon pretty effectively. Then, she leaned forward, the robe slipping even further in response to my erotic thoughts. </p><p> Her gaze found mine when she finally opened her eyes, still swaying with the music. I noticed it, yet didn’t raise mine to meet hers, instead of staying stuck to her amazing chest, which was enough to make her nipples harden even more.  </p><p>“It’s time for the next step,” I whispered even as I patted my lap. It was all that was needed to make her react. She turned her back, giving me a glimpse of her plump ass before she started lowering herself, And since I was already sporting an erection, she didn’t have any trouble finding her landing spot, trapping between her beautiful cheeks as her back pressed against my chest, our skin separated just by our robes. </p><p>Even after everything we had done together today, I could not help but be aroused. Not that it was too shocking. Penny was beautiful, alluring, dressed specifically as a gift for me, waiting for me to unwrap her. My raging erection, captured between her cheeks, even the slightest movement of her hips sending shocks through my system hardly hurt. </p><p>Her beauty was not just a spark but out of controlled forest fire, and I was just an abandoned tanker of gasoline, under the mercy of her beauty. </p><p>I grabbed her waist, enjoying the three layers of softness, the satin robe, the silky ribbon, and most importantly, her beautiful skin. She trembled slightly under her touch, but the quick movements of her hips were more than enough to convey her passion. </p><p>Especially since the choppiness of her movement that defined her movements while she danced had disappeared completely, leaving its place for a smooth, sensual movement. </p><p>Once again, a great example of eroticism. </p><p>My fingers wiggled, finding her naked waist as she continued to rock her hips steadily, like she was trying to prove that her beautiful ass was superior to Nancy’s toned one even without going the full distance. </p><p>If that was her intention, however, she needed to work much harder. That was not a slight to her, as she had an amazing ass, but so did Nancy…</p><p>Unsurprisingly, she lacked the courage to say anything even as her hips started moving faster, my fingers continuing to explore her skin, smooth yet fiery at the same time. I felt her quiver as my shaft got buried between her beautiful valley. </p><p>The sensation was good, but not as amazing as it could have been, I decided as I slowly slid my hands up until I felt the edge of her breasts, getting freer from the already-deficient hold of the ribbon as she rocked her hips heatedly. </p><p>Direct groping was definitely against the lapdance etiquette, but I had a wild feeling that Penny might let that egregious move slide, so I let my fingers continue to move up, caressing more and more of their glorious expanse, followed by reckless cupping that sank my fingers deep into her flesh. </p><p>The moan she let out in response was simply spectacular. </p><p>I enjoyed the soft weight of her globes against my palms as I squeezed them, enjoying the sudden speed her hips had picked up, my mind already on the next step, trying to decide on the optimal moment to free her from the oppression of her robe… </p><p>Yet, in a surprising display of initiative, Penny stole that opportunity from me. She slid away before I could break the rules of the private dance, turning her back to me. Though, watching the robe slide down her body slowly, revealing her smooth shoulders, interrupted only by a lone red ribbon, barely enough to hide inches of her curvy body, the color contrast was especially beautiful under the low light… </p><p>So beautiful that, even when she started turning toward me, I didn’t reach for my camera, enjoying the moment for myself… </p>",

    "content": "<p>“So, you have a mission for me,” Sapphire commented, her voice surprisingly even. Under normal circumstances, a comment like that, delivered by the Queen of the Empire, would have been a huge cause of concern. </p><p>With her current position, perched on top of me, naked, her hips rocking steadily as she did her best to search for another climax, the circumstances were rather extraordinary.</p><p>“Exactly, I have a mission for you,” I said, grabbing her hips to drive the message — along with another very important thing — even deeper. </p><p>“Am I going to be alone in this mission?” she asked, though, this time, I could detect fear despite her attempts to conceal it. </p><p>“Good question,” I answered even as tightened my grip on her hips, their hypnotic movement under my touch giving me a rather spectacular distraction, especially with the way she impaled herself fully under her weight, each second enough to consist of eternity under her beautiful rhythm. </p><p>Letting that rhythm hypnotize me to avoid the complicated question of arranging her protection team was certainly tempting. </p><p>Unfortunately, it was too tempting. If I made that decision, there was no guarantee that I would be helped up by the ruthless dance of her hips while I delayed important decisions. </p><p>That didn’t mean intended to ask her to stop, of course. I put my hands on my breasts, ruthlessly squeezing as I thought of a way to save time. “It’s time to go back to your room, Your Majesty,” I said, still enjoying her title despite everything. </p><p>The irony of using it was too delicious to miss, especially since once our ploy had gone into effect, it would lose that ironic value. </p><p>“W-we’re stopping?” she stammered, her expression of disappointment too beautiful, especially since, despite its intensity, she didn’t think for a second before making that decision. </p><p>Simply amazing, I thought even as I followed her move and stood up, my glistening shaft dangling. “Yeah, we have wasted enough time playing, and you need to go back to your room to prepare. And I can use the journey to make that final decision.” I smirked. “After all, your sudden appearance had forced me to quicken my plans slightly.” </p><p>“I see,” she murmured, blushing slightly even as she made a move toward her dress. Her poor, ripped dress required a lot of magic to be fixed. </p><p>I decided to help her, waving my hand. My magic flared, and a second later, her dress caught fire, turning into cinders. “No need to waste your time with such an ugly dress,” I commented.</p><p>“B-but, how am I going to walk back,” she gasped in shock, the sudden blush cute on her otherwise confident face. </p><p>“Well, that’s the risk we have to take,” I said, my tone somber like I was the one that was committing a huge sacrifice.  </p><p>Not that there was any risk for her. Among the core group, only Lancelot was still under the impression that I was a prisoner and unaware of the liberties I was taking, and in his misguided attempts to play for the bigger prize between the mysterious enemies, he didn’t have the luxury to visit my cell. </p><p>The girls, except Isolde who was currently enjoying a cell of her own in an amusing reversal, were a more mixed bag. After everything we had done, I was willing to bet that Aria would have the presence of mind to stay hidden even if she came across us, though explaining that to her afterward would be challenging. </p><p>Fun, but still challenging. </p><p>Emma had the potential to be harder to control, especially thanks to her rather flexible sense of loyalty. I certainly wouldn’t want elves to know the full extent of my relationship with the Queen — though, ironically, the same didn’t apply to the Phoenix she was serving simultaneously, because I had already told her that I was actually the king, and just faking my death. </p><p>Sapphire looked hesitant at my words, so I decided to encourage her a bit. Not by explaining my thought process to her, but something more direct. </p><p>More primal. </p><p>I put my hand on her plump ass, enjoying its softness, but it was just a momentary stop before my fingers slipped into her wet core. Her eyes widened as she realized that walking naked wasn’t my only plan. </p><p>Yet, the shock didn’t survive more than a few seconds, immediately replaced by fearful anticipation. “Walk,” I ordered as I slipped my fingers deeper into her wetness. </p><p>For a moment, she stood shakily on her legs, took a deep breath, and started to walk. From one perspective, it was absurd for her to react to the risk of being seen that much considering her side job, but I knew the power of embracing identities very well. </p><p>Being an erotic dancer in public was not a problem, nor it was a problem for her to be a slutty queen in private. </p><p>But being a slutty queen in a place where others could stumble, not a stitch of clothing on her body, being fingered by the dark lord that was supposed to be a prisoner… </p><p>It was clearly more than she could casually resist. To her credit, after a deep breath — one that enhanced her already-amazing bosom significantly — she started walking, each trembling step she took a masterful show. </p><p>She walked obediently even as my fingers made it difficult. </p><p>“So,” I commented as we stepped out of the cell, the chilly air of the secret passage achieving the impossible and making her nipples even harder. “Any preferences about your bodyguard during the process?” I asked. </p><p>“How about Emma?” she offered between her shaky breaths. “It’s not like she has anything important to do?” </p><p>“Sure,” I said mockingly. “If you want your every move to be reported to both parties immediately.” </p><p>“That traitor!” Sapphire gasped as her eyes widened, catching the meaning of my words immediately — not that they were particularly hard to decipher. “After everything I had done to that peasant whore. I’ll kill her—“ she continued a while before I interrupted with a nice spank to her ass. </p><p>“It’s not the time, you can always punish her once we finish this debacle, but not before. For the moment, she’s an excellent source to feed them false information, along with Lancelot.” </p><p>“That bastard as well,” she growled, her anger getting thicker despite the dance of my fingers. </p><p>“It’s what happens when you elevate the chosen ones just because they can use a fancy sword. They start to think that they deserve everything,” I commented. </p><p>“How about Isolde?” she asked. </p><p>“Not a bad option, actually,” I said, giving it a bit of thought. Her loyalty was assured, and she was not bad when it came to physical combat, making her a veritable threat to anyone that might target Sapphire. Yes, she was imprisoned at the moment, but it wouldn’t be hard to free her from there after talking with our naughty Phoenix. </p><p>But, after thinking a bit more, I decided against it. “It wouldn’t work, not with her temper,” I decided. “Especially not during an undercover.” </p><p>“But then who?” Sapphire said. “Most of the royal guard is either incompetent, or a part of the other noble families. When it comes to both loyal and competent, Isolde is still the best option.” </p><p>I frowned as I considered her words. She really seemed to be correct, so I started thinking about it. The silence echoed on the secret passage, interrupted by the subtle sound of my fingers invading her core, and the occasional moans that escaped her beautiful lips. </p><p>Then, a flash of realization appeared on my face as a certain blonde knight popped into my mind. “Of course!” I said, celebrating that with another spank to her ass, one that made it jiggle beautifully. </p><p>“Do you want to share that with me?” she murmured, though before she could follow up, my fingers returned to her core, sliding inside her repeatedly, once again blocking her words with her moans. </p><p>“Maybe, if you think you deserve it?” I commented, only to get a sarcastic gaze in response. Coming from someone else, or even under different circumstances, I might have reacted harder, but at that moment, under the circumstances, I found her gaze incredibly endearing. “Alright,” I said with a smirk. “I was thinking of Valkyrie.” </p><p>Just like that, Sapphire stood frozen. “Valkyrie, the legendary hero of the border!” Sapphire gasped, her legs trembling badly enough that she needed to lean against the wall, her surprise even thicker than the time I had revealed my true identity. “Don’t tell me that she’s one of yours as well.” </p><p>I chuckled at her shock, considering whether to tell her that it was too shocking to have a border hero under my control while I had both the Queen and the Crown Princess eating out of my hand, but decided against it. </p><p>I had bullied my poor little queen too much today. Instead, I slapped her plump ass again, gesturing for her to continue walking. “Don’t worry about it,” I said after she started. “She’s not one of mine, and she’s actually loyal to your Empire. We just had some fair dealings.” </p><p>“What kind of dealings?” she asked, clearly unwilling to trust someone that was willing to sell the Empire to me after everything. </p><p>“Don’t worry, she didn’t compromise any of the Empire’s benefits, even a few times I requested her to. I have sold her information about the dark houses that were making an issue on the border, and in exchange, she paid back to me in a way that wouldn’t hurt the Empire.” </p><p>I would have expected Sapphire to focus on the payment, but she was clearly too shocked to properly process it. “And why did you sell that information. You’re the dark lord. Why would you want the dark families to fail.” A rather big oversight for a ruler. </p><p>She was so lucky to have a selfless helper like me to assist her, seeking no benefit of my own!</p><p> “Oh, come on, beautiful. You know it very well that the dark families were my true enemies, or are you forgetting how did you manage to capture me in the first place?” </p><p>“But still, you were the one ruling the land. Expanding the borders would surely help you?” </p><p>I shook my head dismissively. Sapphire was smart, certainly much smarter than many of the morons that held the throne of the Empire, but she still made that fundamental mistake. “What’s the point of that. At best, it’ll increase the amount I could tax, and maybe a few more conscripts for an army. And in exchange, it’ll politically strengthen whatever family that managed to invade those lands, forcing me to spend even more to defend myself. Even worse, it might have earned a much more comprehensive reaction from the Empire.” </p><p>“But, in the end, that reaction still arrived,” Sapphire answered, though the smugness that she might have carried that declaration absent, another evidence that she had bought the fabricated story I had told for her about being captured intentionally.</p><p>“True, even for me, the involvement of our mysterious enemies was difficult to factor in.” </p><p>“R-right,” she murmured as she stopped once more, but this time, not because of the shock,  but because we had arrived at our destination. “I-is this it?” she murmured as she glanced at the entrance of her royal quarters, wordlessly inviting me inside.</p>",

    "content": "<p>“Take care, and call me whenever you want,” I said as I sent one last smirk her way, enjoying the way she blushed prettily. </p><p>However, as I walked the back office, I had to forget the sudden temptation her blush awakened. With everything going on, I had bigger priorities than possibly seducing a cute girl, if a touch too ambitious when it came to board games. </p><p>Yet, before I could reach the target computer, my phone buzzed. I wanted to ignore it, but a couple more buzzing indicated that it was more of an urgent issue, forcing me to pull my phone. </p><p>It was Megan calling. </p><p>I rejected the call. ‘How can I help you?’ I wrote even as I walked down, down the corridor toward the shared office that was rarely used.  After all, just because Lauren allowed me to enter didn’t mean that I was actually allowed to be here anymore. </p><p>She called again, but I rejected that again, not wanting to talk to her in the corridor. </p><p>‘We need to talk, and it’s urgent,’ she said. </p><p>‘I might for a quick minute. I just finished training,’ I wrote back. It wasn’t the perfect time to talk with her, but the time we spent together was enough to get a sense of her character. </p><p>She was clearly not used to being said no, and I was too busy to teach. </p><p>I barely stepped into the shared office when I received her call. I closed the door before I answered. “How are you, my dear girlfriend?” I said, not bothering to hide my mocking tone. </p><p>“Don’t sass me,” she answered, her voice sharp, yet that only made me smile wider. It was fun to tease her. “You’ll come here for a couple of hours. I need your help,” she asked. </p><p>“Really?” I said. “And you know I’m free for it and don’t have some very important things to consider, how?” </p><p>A chuckle came from the background, female, but it was clearly not Megan. She was busy growling. “Are you busy?” she said, though it still managed to come out despite her effort to soften it down. </p><p>She was truly different without people to impress with her fake personality. </p><p>“Depends,” I answered. </p><p>“Depends on what?” she said, her tone sharp.  </p><p>“Why are you asking for two hours of my time, of course,” I said, unable to keep my chuckle down. “I have time to repeat our little car adventure, but I don’t have time to help you do your homework. Not unless you make it worth my while, of course.” </p><p>“Don’t be ridiculous!” Megan gasped, though the chuckles in the background rose even more. “Just stop being an asshole and come here.”  </p><p>“I’m sorry, your ladyship,” I answered even as I typed the password and the username to the shared computer. They were not mine, of course. They belonged to one of the supervisors, as I didn’t intend to set up the illegal programs under my credentials. </p><p>It was not likely to be discovered, as IT security was simply horrible, but it was better safe than sorry. </p><p>“We need to have a date,” Megan said as I logged into the computer. </p><p>I immediately lost interest. Technically, I needed Intent, and I needed it urgently, but I needed more than a boring date could create. Without a quarterback to humiliate, it wouldn’t gather enough Intent to risk my chances of playing. </p><p>“I’m assuming the boring kind,” I answered dismissively. “I don’t have the time. Maybe tomorrow?” </p><p>My rejection made her gasp in anger, but I started typing without waiting for an answer, checking the item order, mapping just how many parties had been communicated. It was possible to change the orders for the museum, but that wouldn’t help much, not if someone decided to track that orb. </p><p>The other museum’s records would still show the delivery. </p><p>“Impossible. Tomorrow you’re going to be even busier, and that’s assuming you can even wake up. Coach Bill doesn’t allow anyone that can’t memorize the play book for the week to leave.” </p><p>I sighed. “You’re not making the argument you think you’re making. It’s just more reason for me to study before the meeting,” I said, even as I continued checking the supervisor’s emails and the other communication orders, trying to find which delivery company delivered the items that included the orb. </p><p>“Please,” she said, though her sudden tone shift didn’t surprise me. She was more than adept to get what she wanted, but I would certainly pay for that teasing at one point. “I’m not going to take more than an hour of your time. And the swimming pool is just a couple of minutes away from the stadium. I can pick you up.” </p><p>“Swimming pool?” I said, stopping typing for a moment, the location suggesting it might not just be a boring date that she had in mind. After some thinking, I decided to accept it. The location was interesting enough to change my mind, and Megan owing me a favor for that was even more interesting. “Don’t worry about picking me up. I already have another car. But what do you mean by saying the pool is just a couple of minutes of drive away. Which pool?” </p><p>“The swimming team’s pool, of course,” Megan said in a matter-of-fact tone.  </p><p>“I didn’t know it was open for public usage?” </p><p>“Don’t worry, I’m not an idiot. I arranged everything,” she said proudly. </p><p>“How shocking,” I said drolly. “But I don’t have my swimsuit with me. Should I assume you handled that as well, or should I hope for a fun skinny-dipping session.” </p><p>“Don’t be crass. I’ll bring one for you with me.” </p><p>“Oh, that’s interesting,” I said, my smirk widening. “And I’m guessing there will be a friend with you, taking our photos. Perhaps the one in the background, giggling.”</p><p>“Oh, you’re good,” called another voice from the back.  </p><p>“Shush,” Megan said dismissively, no doubt targeting her friend before turning her attention to me. “Naturally,” she said, though her voice was sharp, clearly not appreciating my haggling. “I’ll be at the entrance in fifteen minutes, be ready.” Then, before I could answer, she cut off the call unceremoniously. </p><p>Curious, I thought, as she was considerably tenser than I had expected. </p><p>So curious that I stopped my research for a moment to check the social media, only to find several posts and threads, about Megan and me, quite a few of them posted by the same cheerleader that had been frolicking with Kevin, saying that she was a frigid bitch incapable of any kind of intimacy. </p><p>There were also several insinuations about my body, a certain part in particular, suggesting that a little limp boy and a frigid bitch were the perfect combination.</p><p>“Fuck,” I murmured even as I turned my attention back to the computer. </p><p>Normally, I wouldn’t have exactly minded such rumors, secure enough with my equipment. Unfortunately, with everything I was facing, the impression of other people was more than critical. </p><p>And if there was one thing that would reduce the impressiveness of a man in the public eye, it was the gossip about a small or malfunctioning package. </p><p>Luckily, it seemed that my fake girlfriend was even more conscious about my reputation — even if that was to protect her own purposes. She caught the attack before it turned into a public gossip, and already reacting to counter that. </p><p>It didn’t take a genius how could a pool could be used to counter those rumors. </p><p>Of course, none of that meant that I was going to rush like a little puppy, trying to stick to her arbitrary deadline. I still had important work to do in the museum, and even without that, I wasn’t one of the guys who would rush for her needs just because she snapped her fingers. </p><p>I turned my full attention to the computer, doing my best to find the information I was looking for. Yet, cycled between different clunky windows of the inventory software to find the information I needed, and a melancholic sensation hit me. It hadn’t been a good job, neither in terms of the quality of work or pay, but it was still the longest job I had ever held, and losing it was a weird feeling. </p><p>And for better or worse, the job allowed me to get in contact with the orb, throwing my life into a completely unknown situation. </p><p>Pity that I had to prioritize getting Traits over nostalgia, and not just because I had a nagging angel forcing me to do so. Things were getting dangerous, and I didn’t want to be caught unprepared.</p><p>With a sigh, I moved between the windows, compiling all the necessary records, delivery timings, storage records, and even the additional notes.  </p><p>I moved to checkout records, curious if anyone had recorded its disappearance. Which, luckily, this wasn’t the case, but unfortunately, it still showed me as the last one to check it out. </p><p>The museum was lax, but not lax enough to miss that little detail. Luckily, the supervisor's credentials allowed me to quickly change that, and erase any information that had been even been in the museum. </p><p>From a technical perspective, that move should not have been allowed, but luckily for me, the program the museum was using was just that old and poorly written, lacking the necessary checks. </p><p>Even luckier, I managed to identify the museum that sourced the orb, and they had also managed the delivery internally, meaning that I only needed access to one system. </p><p>With a sigh, I did my best to rapidly compile several convincing emails, with convenient links that would download some convenient keyloggers to their computers, hoping that receiving that mail from another museum employee would be enough to trick them.  </p><p>And, before leaving, I made sure to install a nifty little program that would give me remote access without raising any alert. </p><p>“Done,” I murmured and stood up. </p><p>With that, I had nothing else to do in the museum, leaving me free to go and see what my fake girlfriend had been planning. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“What do you want?” I asked, rather than asking exactly what she could do for me. Not because I fully believed that she had the ability to cure me — as most of the experimental notes highlighted gruesome failures.</p><p>While the experimental notes she had shared were hard to comprehend fully, they all had one thing in common. Even the best success was limited, even the most resounding success was limited compared to my survival. </p><p>Yet, those failures all told me one thing. Dragon hearts was something even more complicated than I had assumed. </p><p>She was my only path to continued survival, at least one that I continued to be a human, as I had no idea just how long I would have been contained in my transformation. </p><p>Ironically, they had sent such a precious healer to cure a slave, giving me an option to get away, but ultimately, that wasn’t too surprising. It wouldn’t be the first extravagant noble move that caused a true disaster. And whether it was being a ploy to take me down for some reason, I didn’t even give a second. A plan like that simply had too many moving parts to success, making it an idiotic strategy.  </p><p>Though it was depressing to remember just how close I had come to total annihilation, using the heart as a weapon for the last stand, only to survive by monumental, miraculous luck. </p><p>“Good question, heretic,” she said, once again making me curious why she had used that particular word, but I let that slide. It wasn’t as important as her demands. “I need an escort in my travels, of course,” she answered. “And I believe I have the ability to pay the necessary price, don’t you think?” </p><p>Whether she had the ability to do so was questionable, but that didn’t change fact that she was offering me more information than I could steal even if I had visited every single patrician library, or even decided to visit other countries. </p><p>My information-gathering abilities were nothing in comparison to the full range of abilities of House Junia, and my unnamed sorceress represented the distillation of that information, along with unmatched expertise on the topic — otherwise, they wouldn’t have gone all that effort to keep her prisoner. I doubted House Junia was lacking in sorcerers. </p><p>“I do,” I said. A simple, unadorned description, yet it was all I needed. </p><p>I accepted her offer.</p><p>I didn’t bother questioning her about her ultimate objective, or asking her to prove my trust was not unfounded for one very simple reason. </p><p>Ironically, that reason was the number of failed experiments she had displayed. Those were enough to convey her commitment to the strategy. The information she had shared with me revealed that I represented an excellent piece of experimentation for her ‘employer’ and by capturing me, they could have completed the research much quicker. </p><p>Yet, she clearly believed that completing the research was not in her best interest. Instead, she took the risk of inviting me to her meeting despite knowing that several hours was I needed as a sorcerer to disappear completely. </p><p>Not that I blamed her. My own experiences with ‘Master’ Antonius were enough to show that a relationship between a master and a slave was never reciprocal, no matter the benefits one provided. My success had given Antonius and the Dacian School the success they needed to stand against the combined attack of Gallic and Bestiaries schools, even allowing them to reverse the situation rather spectacularly. </p><p>As thanks, I was stabbed in the back in a very spectacular manner. </p><p>“Good, what’s the plan then?” she asked, only for her eyes to widen in shock when I reached to touch the bars that had separated her cell — her very luxurious cell, but a cell nonetheless — and broke the wards. “Right now?” she gasped in shock. </p><p>“Nothing like the present,” I answered. I had always liked to act decisive, and more importantly, I didn’t have unlimited access to Junia estate. I had no idea whether I would be invited again despite the potential influence I had on Atia. </p><p>Especially since it was more than likely that the next invite might be delivered to Olivia’s house, or might happen in the house of a different friend. And even if I had been invited directly, there was no guarantee that it would coincide with the visit of that many nobles. </p><p>Nobles that created an excellent scapegoat for a potential breach. After all, who would suspect a poor barbarian slave, where there were several suspiciously ambitious nobles in assistance, each with myriad reasons to sabotage House Junia’s overambitious experiment. </p><p>Under the shocked gaze of my newest ally, I quickly drew several runes, their nature slowly breaking into the wards that secured her into her cell — separate from the outer wards around the cell that I bypassed. Normally, that many security layers were supposed to make it harder to break, but ironically, it made my job easier, creating a magical shadow I could hide under while I worked on inner wards. </p><p>It took less than a minute for me to successfully create a temporary breach. “Let’s go,” I said, and she stepped out, not bothering to pick anything from the room. Smart, I thought, even though I had spared a sad glance toward the piles of paper that filled the room.</p><p>Taking them along was too risky, and not because they might be tracked magically. Carrying piles of paper was hardly the best possible disguise. </p><p>“How?” she gasped as she walked toward the opening, shocked at my speed. </p><p>“You have your strengths, beautiful, and I have mine,” I said with a smile, deliberately acting mysteriously. Since we were about to ally, it was better for her to know that I wasn’t just a simple sorcerer with a unique affliction — wasn’t that a ridiculous definition for my case — but another mysterious entity with his own abilities and secrets. </p><p>Since we were going to cooperate for a foreseeable future, showing off a bit to raise my value was the better idea. </p><p>Before she could step through the gate, I raised my hand. “Wait,” I ordered. </p><p>“Why?” she asked, naturally suspicious. </p><p>“To make sure you don’t have any kind of tracking spell on you that would trigger the moment you get out, of course,” I said. </p><p>That made her stop for a moment, which was understandable. Because to see if there was any detection spell on her — especially ones that were subtle enough to avoid her attention — I needed to push my magic directly into her body. </p><p>A move that could as well turn into a deadly attack. </p><p>She froze as she weighed her trust — one that was born from reading my needs — and her life. I couldn’t help but smile at the irony. She was facing the same dilemma that I had faced just moments ago. </p><p>To her credit, she didn’t ask whether she could trust me, smart enough to realize just how stupid such a question would have been. Yet, regardless her final decision wasn’t in doubt. She let out a sigh as she closed her eyes, and took a step forward. </p><p>I put my hand on her temples, and infused her body with magic aggressively, carefully examining every part of her body, a task that was much more difficult than just breaking wards. </p><p>Perfect time for some casual talk. “So, tell me. What’s the deal with calling me a heretic?” </p><p>“You dare to use the Imperial Blessing of Divine Pearl despite not having the approval of Jade Emperor,” she said between her clenched teeth, confirming that it wasn’t just a generic term of any Roman that earned her distaste. </p><p>I felt special. </p><p>“So, if that makes me a heretic, what does committing all those experiments make you?” I asked, but seeing her eyes tighten, I didn’t follow up with her on the subject. </p><p>It was clearly a sore spot for her. </p><p>Instead, I focused on her body, quickly unraveling a few subtle wards that had been integrated into her body, with a level of skill that surprised me. Luckily, a flood of mana was enough to catch most of them. </p><p>“Now, take a step forward,” I said, but kept my mana on her body, blanketing her. It proved to be a smart precaution, because, the moment she had stepped through, I had caught another, even subtler ward triggering, no doubt to inform the guards about the breach, but with my mana surrounding her, it was much easier to prevent. </p><p>Yet, that was not the end of my precautions. I carefully wrapped her with my mana, creating a cocoon around her, one that worked to erase her presence. Meanwhile, I had split my attention, the other half infusing the wards through the runes I had used to breach them, carefully observing the changes. </p><p>I rapidly blocked three alarms, each geared to trigger once they failed to notice her presence in the room. </p><p>With that done, I turned my attention to my nameless sorceress, who was doing her best to suppress her nerves under my direct command. I was tempted to continue a few more minutes, to teach her a lesson about blackmailing me. </p><p>Unfortunately, I didn’t have time to waste on that. </p><p>“Let’s go,” I said as I pulled my mana off her body, and turned my back. </p><p>All that remained was to escape from a prison that was built to keep a sorceress prisoner. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I was curious what kind of objective led her to decide that getting me drunk in the particular way she decided to employ was a good idea. She didn’t give me any sign about the reason as she limited herself to leaning back, watching me smugly. </p><p>I continued to eat the pastries she had prepared with great ‘effort’, giving her the opportunity she needed to speak. </p><p>Though, I had to admit that, enjoying the carefully-prepared breakfast while she shuffled in her seat carefully to maximize the impact of her beauty was a pleasant affair despite her trick. She certainly had the instincts to cultivate an aura of seduction, and with the assistance of the skills she had picked, it turned into an amazing show. </p><p>Almost enough to forgive her attempt to manipulate me with some direct, adulterated assistance. </p><p>Almost. </p><p>I waited until our eyes met, and smiled. “The breakfast is delicious,” I murmured, though I avoided slurring, not wanting to give her the impression that the pastries she prepared were too effective. </p><p>I wanted to enjoy the process.</p><p>“I’m happy to hear you like it,” Delia said. </p><p>“Oh yeah,” I told her even as I glanced down, getting a very interesting angle down the loose dress she had worn for my pleasure, the angle particularly spectacular. </p><p>Her smile promised me a lot of interesting things. </p><p>But, since she was yet to make a move to deliver one of those promises, I decided to act proactively. After all the effort, I deserved an advance. I leaned to the side, and before she could react, my arm was already around her waist, and pulled her onto my lap. </p><p>The slight widening of her eyes as I moved faster than she expected was beautiful, but when my arm was wrapped around her waist, she made no move to pull back, instead of giggling playfully. It was an artificial move, her hand already on my chest — giving her an excuse to push me away a bit while still maintaining intimate physical contact. </p><p>A beautiful attempt. Too bad I had no intention of allowing her to succeed. The exact nature of her trickery went a long way to prevent me from doing so, no matter how amused I was, dealing with someone else trying the use my tricks on me. </p><p>“So,” I whispered into her ear as I pulled her closer, a touch harder than necessary to suggest while I wasn’t drunk enough to slur, I was drunk enough to lose control of my strength slightly — the fake strength I had convinced her that I had, of course, as my real strength was not something she could handle, even playfully. “Tell me, what do you want?” </p><p>“Want…” she said, stammering, caught surprised at my sudden words, especially with my lips close enough to brush against her. Flustered, for a moment I had thought she was about to deny needing anything. She picked a different direction. “Why do you think I want something?” </p><p>A simple yet smart way to deflect. Not admitting anything, yet not committing to not asking the favor yet as well. Of course, there were many ways to bypass such an argument, but I decided to have mercy on her. “Well, the amazing breakfast you had prepared for me was one clue…” </p><p>Then, before she could say anything, I grabbed the front of her dress, and pulled. It wasn’t a hard pull, but it wasn’t a sturdy dress either, easily rippling to reveal her breasts. I grabbed one of the spectacular globes that were revealed completely, and whispered again. “And, the dress is not bad as far as the clues yet.” A smirk popped to my face. “Sorry, was.”  </p><p>She tensed, but forced a giggle quickly to hide that tenseness. “Well, I need something…” she murmured, her voice turning beautifully seductive after the initial tremble. Clearly, whatever she had in mind was more important than the presence of my dancing fingers, clamping around her nipple. </p><p>“Oh, really?” I whispered as I twisted her nipple, using the opportunity to sneak some more mana into her body to examine her. And I kissed her neck, making her tremble, which allowed me to be even more reckless. </p><p>[-216 Mana]</p><p>The moan that escaped, far too melodic and soft to be fake, was delicious. Unfortunately, I had other things to focus on. Arriving at her soul space, I turned my attention to its unique structure even more carefully to understand how exactly she could change her skills that easily. </p><p>The first thing I checked was the authenticity of it, afraid that she might be using a fake soul space. Yet, examining carefully, I could feel the connection her Skills had with her soul space. Meaning, it wasn’t a fake.</p><p>At least, not the way I had created it, I corrected myself as continued to examine it, only to notice the skills weren’t as static as they were supposed to be. Instead, there was a sense of shuffling and lessening. </p><p>Like an ice cube, slowly melting under the sun, melting, so was the mana that created it was melting slowly. </p><p>How interesting, I thought even as I continued examining it. It wasn’t a quick process, one that required only minutes to complete, but even by a simple estimation, it was certain that it wouldn’t last a week. </p><p>And it would certainly lose its effectiveness to work as a skill in a shorter time, though, on that, being more accurate was rather difficult. I tried to poke it with my own mana, but noticing it hardly helped the stability of the skill, I had to pull back. </p><p>I didn’t want to risk revealing my hand just yet. </p><p>With that, I pulled back from her soul space, making a note to examine that later. But since my mana was already inside, it would have been a waste to let that mana disperse. Instead, I started to infuse that mana into her body carefully, to trigger her arousal. </p><p>After all, she earned her treatment with the trick she had tried to pull. </p><p>My trick sounded simple, but casting a spell on a mage’s body while keeping them unaware was certainly not a simple task. It stretched my abilities to the limit, and even then, it was a task that would take a while. </p><p>Luckily, I had some proper entertainment to distract me. “Delicious,” I whispered as I squeezed her breast once more, amused by the tightness of her moan, one that was much more honest than before.</p><p>Though, the intensity surprised me. Even with my mana beginning to assist, it was an intensity that I hadn’t been expecting from an experienced woman. </p><p>Which was rather interesting, especially with the smoothness of her earlier flirting, suggesting that, despite using that as a strategy many times, she had never let things come to such a point. Which was, on the one hand, showed just how good she was when it came to seduction, getting whatever she wanted by just dangling the possibility without paying the bill in the end. </p><p>On the other hand, it showed just how badly she needed whatever she was searching for, even more than the Divine Spark storage I had been developing for them if her commitment was any indicator.  </p><p>“Tell me,” I whispered, feeling curious. “Is your princess is aware of what you’re doing here, or it’s just a freelancing request, only for you.” </p><p>Her eyes widened, displaying fear and panic. Pity her amazing acting abilities were not enough to hide their artificial nature, giving me the answer she had been searching for. She wasn’t afraid that her ploy had been revealed, which meant the princess was aware of it. </p><p>Or at a minimum, she was confident the princess wouldn’t care about it. </p><p>“It’s only for me, but it’s very important,” she begged as her hands landed on my neck. “Please don’t tell anyone, not even the princess.” </p><p>“Mm,” I murmured, my smirk getting wider. “And what if I need something to keep my mouth shut.” </p><p>“Maybe a kiss,” she murmured as she leaned forward, her tongue darting out to caress my lips before hers connected, her tongue slipping inside my mouth. I let her tongue dance according to her wishes before I retaliated, our assaults clashing for a moment before she found the situation completely reversed. </p><p>The kiss was delicious, though not enough for me to focus all my attention on it. Instead, I focused my attention on my mana, intent on triggering her mana even further, to use her distraction. </p><p>… only for my eyes to widen in shock. Luckily, I was better at acting than her to disguise my shock, and it survived on my face only for a fraction of a second before it disappeared. </p><p>However, the same didn’t remove the reason for my shock. I had noticed that, over her skin, there was a whole layer of mana, almost like a second skin. I couldn’t help but feel impressed, because it was subtle. </p><p>Subtle enough to avoid my attention despite our closeness. </p><p>I couldn’t help but frown at the impressiveness of the achievement. I was an expert on magic, and my stats allowed me to have unmatched flexibility. Yet, despite spending so much time with her over several days, I had failed to notice it. </p><p>Or was I, I suddenly corrected my thoughts. After all, I had failed to notice her disguise. What guarantee there was that I had been dealing with Delia on previous days… </p><p>Yet another mystery to solve. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 32 Experience: 499110 / 528000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6528 / 6528 Mana: 7810 / 8000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [77/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>",

    "content": "<p>For a moment, I said nothing, enjoying the sensation of my shaft pressing against Umi’s trembling back, my arms loose around her hips, giving her the opportunity to get away. </p><p>Fortunately, she lacked the willpower to do so, and continued staying on my lap, trying to understand the situation she found herself in as she used her hands as a bra. And Tiffany playing with water across us, her glorious breasts displayed perfectly, was not helping her to calm down. </p><p>Yet, she stayed, a combination of a potential promotion for her soon-to-be husband working together with her natural non-confrontational personality, even as my naked shaft pressed against her. </p><p>The fact that she was trying to hide what was going on from her new friend played a nice role in her mood as well. </p><p>Altogether, it was a spectacular situation. </p><p>And if there was one benefit of pushing her so far outside her comfort zone, her experiences about what was appropriate and what was not long abandoned as she trusted her new best friend about guiding her about appropriate behavior. </p><p>I let the moment stretch for a while before I slid one of my hands to her thighs, the other staying on her stomach, and start caressing softly, her skin softer than silk. “So, Tiffany,” I asked casually, like the situation was nothing out of ordinary. “Any stories about where you have purchased those bikinis?” </p><p>Umi tensed, but did nothing else as Tiffany answered. “Unfortunately, no,” she said with a mock exaggeration, quick to take my hint. “I have purchased them so long away that I forgot to have any stories.” </p><p>“Oh,  such a pity,” I answered. “A beautiful woman like you shouldn’t be bereft of stories. Maybe tomorrow, you should go shopping to buy some new ones to replace them, so that you can have stories to share.” </p><p>“A good sentiment, but how can I have stories if I shop alone. My husband hates shopping.” </p><p>I waited for a second, enjoying the way Umi shuffled self-consciously at the mention of Tiffany’s husband, no doubt indirectly remembering her own fiancee, but interestingly, that was not enough for her to ask for a change in seating. And, even with the limited view due to my angle, I could see her expression enough to ascertain that it was not just about hesitancy. </p><p>She was battling with arousal, a sensation that was clearly unfamiliar to her if her reaction was any indicator. </p><p>“I’m sure Umi wouldn’t mind accompanying you, would you sweetie?” I whispered into her ear, making her tremble badly. </p><p>“I-I wouldn’t mind,” she stammered, not expecting to be questioned. </p><p>“Good,” Tiffany said, her smile getting bigger before flickering. “Too bad that our family budget is stretched tight for the moment, and I can’t afford to splurge for a beautiful bikini,” she said, her sadness exaggerated. </p><p>“Well,” I answered, my smirk reminiscent of a wolf. “Maybe a little promotion could help you ease your worries?” I asked. </p><p>“A promotion, really!” Tiffany said, her earlier despondency replaced by an exaggerated cheer. “I’m sure my husband would love to receive that news.” </p><p>“I’m sure he will, if he gets it,” I answered, though it was mostly to remind Umi that there were tangible benefits to sacrificing her ethics for a bit of pleasure. The way she shuffled in my lap, confused and aroused, told me that it was a perfect mental hit. </p><p>“What do I need to do, boss,” Tiffany moaned softly as she leaned forward, her lips parted sensually. </p><p>I grabbed Umi’s waist and lifted her for a moment, freeing my shaft from the delicious pressure of her ass. She gasped in surprise as I kept her up, her shy voice echoing on the rooftop erotically, making me glad that I had reserved the whole area for our private use. </p><p>I shifted my position slightly before lowering her back, her hips pressing more to my stomach, my shaft peeking between her thighs even though it was still buried underwater. “Why don’t you show me just how much you need that promotion?” I asked. </p><p>“With pleasure,” Tiffany asked as she started leaning down, about to dip her head underwater. </p><p>“W-wait—“ Umi gasped, her eyes tracking Tiffany’s descent, surprised by the sudden escalation, yet, as I pressed my finger to her lips, she fell silent, observing as she slowly dipped down, her lips disappearing underwater. </p><p>Admittedly, Umi’s reaction was understandable. Even with the earlier escalations, what we had been doing was rather exaggerated. Making Tiffany service me in front of her, especially in a semi-public space, was one thing, but doing that while she was still on my lap was something else. </p><p>I Umi froze as Tiffany wrapped her lips around my girth underwater, the sensation delicious after our extended foreplay. Unfortunately, the bubbling water prevented it from turning into a visual show, so I reached the remote and stopped the water jets, making the water much clearer. </p><p>The resulting sight hardly helped Umi to calm down about the situation, making her murmur incoherently. However, I was fortunate enough to have enough experience to know that her morality was faltering against her burning arousal, her inexperience unable to handle our calculated seduction. </p><p>I saw no problem driving the dagger even deeper. “Such a loyal wife, isn’t she,” I whispered even as I put my hands to her stomach once more. “She’s doing her best to earn that husband a promotion that might bring mid-five figures extra income to their household.” </p><p>“M-mid-five figures,” she stammered in shock, though her shock wasn’t enough for her to pull her gaze away from the show that was going on between her legs. </p><p>“Of course,” I whispered. “A decent promotion in sales brings that much…” I added, letting it linger for a moment even as I let my hands separate, one climbing up, the other trailing down. The one that was moving up moved much faster, bypassing the limited barrier that her hands were providing to tease the edge of her breast, earning a moan. The other stayed at the edge of her bikini bottoms, not intruding further yet poised for an invasion. “… provided the boss is satisfied, of course.” </p><p>I kept my hands in place, letting her think my words, enjoying the way she trembled, her morals battling with her desires. “But, my fiancee…” she murmured. </p><p>I smirked at her words. A less experienced man might have assumed the mention of her fiancee signaled a danger, but she wasn’t the first committed woman I had seduced. I was familiar enough with a woman’s mind to know that she was just asking for assistance, that for me to provide an excuse for her. </p><p>“Don’t worry, you’re being loyal to him, putting yourself in the line to give him the promotion that he deserves. Imagine just how happier he would be being that successful.” </p><p>“Yes, but…” she murmured, her words once again could be construed as signs of her changing mind, but this time, there was no doubt. Not with the way her hands fell down, finally revealing her breasts for my gaze. </p><p>I let my fingers invade their pale expense for a moment as I stayed silent. As I squeezed her erect nipples, her cries exploded beautifully, suggesting just how overwhelming her tense pleasure had gotten during our extended teasing, one that stretched since the dinner we shared. </p><p>“What he doesn’t know wouldn’t hurt him,” I whispered into her ear like a devil, then my lips caught her earlobe, gently sucking as my fingers danced at the expanse of her surprisingly large breasts, enjoying their softness. </p><p>“M-maybe,” she whispered as she moaned, acting like she hadn’t come to a decision. But, considering that she was naked except for a tiny scrap of cloth that disguised itself as bikini bottom, rocking back and forth as her newest best friend kept her head buried in water between her soft legs while she did her best to teach a new meaning of pleasure to me, it was just another kind fiction. </p><p>I let that fiction survive for a moment more as my left hand continued to dance over her belly. “As you wish, sweetie,” I said as I pulled my lips away from her earlobe, though my right hand stayed in place to continue massaging her breasts. “Feel free to think as much as you want. No pressure.” </p><p>Of course, my version of no pressure didn’t carry a meaning of no pleasure along, I thought in amusement even as my lips moved down to clamp on her neck, teasing her softly. The surprised moan that escaped from her lips was simply beautiful, even as it told me that her fiancee was yet another incompetent man that knew nothing about the female body. </p><p>The neck was the first lock of the female body, and the surprising nature of her moan suggested even Umi was unaware of that fact. </p><p>I was about to decide what to do next, when Tiffany pulled up for a breather. “Finally,” she whispered, a whisper that went unnoticed by Umi, who was busy moaning in pleasure. </p><p>Though, she didn’t stay unaware of her presence when Tiffany grabbed the strings of her bikini, her only remaining part of her clothing…</p>",

    "content": "<p>“So, what’s the plan?” she whispered, her hips dancing even wilder. </p><p>“Simple,” I answered even as I finally loosened my hold on her hips, allowing her to stand up, though she maintained her position for the moment, desperately rocking to attain her climax. “You’re going to mention you’re going to the kitchen, and halfway in, you’re going to mention that you’re going to take a bathroom break…” </p><p>“And I’ll catch her inside,” Naomi answered enthusiastically, wanting to ambush Carrie back after her daring actions on the shopping trip, unaware that another friend of hers was waiting for us inside. </p><p>“Well, we can, but I had a more interesting thing in mind,” I said. “How about I push you against the door in an effort to ‘protect’ her, and we use that opportunity to give her an even closer show. Imagine just how she would feel under your beautiful moans, knowing what she’s missing.” </p><p>Naomi said nothing, nor did she need to with her smile turning predatory, her hips quickening even further. </p><p>Naughty. </p><p>“Let’s start,” I whispered even as I pushed her back, not wanting her to climax before we started the next stage. Things would be much more fun with her on the edge. </p><p>“How about a little break, I’m feeling rather thirsty,” Naomi asked as she stood up in a torturous slowness, giving me an amazing view of her naked body, her skin glistening with a light sheen of sweat, making her even more beautiful. </p><p>Her milky chocolate skin was tempting enough that I regretted stopping, but it was an inevitable move for future fun. </p><p>Instead, I turned to watch her, amused to note the sudden disappearance of the mirror, the bathroom door closed once more. Naomi walked, but she was slow, deliberate, each step making her beautiful ass, bruised by my earlier spanking, sway hypnotically, making my temptation even stronger. </p><p>Especially when she stopped, her eyes meeting with mine, her lips curled mischievously. “On second thought, maybe I should refresh my makeup first,” she said, her voice unnecessarily loud. A beautiful contrast to the soft gasp that escaped from the bathroom, barely audible, yet even more entertaining. </p><p>“Maybe we should make sure you’re properly exhausted before you need to refresh,” I said, doing my best to sound panicked, though failing to hide my amusement. Hopefully, Sarah was too busy with her own growing panic to notice that detail. </p><p>Naomi giggled, but continued to walk toward the bathroom quickly even as I dashed toward her, catching up with her just as she was putting her hand on the doorknob. I pushed her against the door even as I spanked her beautiful ass once more, her moans exploding beautifully. </p><p>She murmured in anticipation as I caressed her wet entrance for a moment before slapping her ass again. “What are you going to do to me?” she gasped. </p><p>“Your mouth needs a punishment,” I said even as I grabbed her shoulder, pushing her down. “Kneel in front of me.” </p><p>She looked shocked at the sudden sharp order, but her shock didn’t contain a hint of dissatisfaction, not when she followed my orders immediately as she turned toward me and fell on her knees, her back pressing against the door. </p><p>The same door that separated us from poor Sarah, who was deprived of the show she was watching, limited to audio. </p><p>Naomi looked at me, her alluring eyes wide with anticipation. “Open your pretty mouth,” I ordered, and she followed it immediately, her lips wide before I could even push my hips forward. </p><p>When I did so, her mouth fell agape. “So big,” she murmured even as her hand wrapped around the base and started pumping before her lips touched. Though, she didn’t lose much time before fixing that particular oversight, her lips landing over its surface. </p><p> “Okay, start working to make it properly … explosive,” I suggested. I received no answer, but considering her lips were busily enveloping the head of my shaft, it wasn’t exactly a disrespect, I thought, unable to prevent a smirk from blooming. </p><p>A smirk that only got stronger as Naomi pushed forward with a surprising aggressiveness. She wasn’t able to take all of it at once, not even close, but I was happy with the effort she was putting into it. </p><p>Especially when she looked up, making the view even more beautiful. </p><p>She maintained eye contact as her lips went back and forth, trying to increase the land she managed to annex even as her hands continued to pull and tug at the base, enhancing the sensation much more. </p><p>The trembling sensation from her loud moans made it even more beautiful, especially when it was interrupted by her delicious gags. She was relentless, her earlier shyness forgotten. A part of it was, without a doubt, her own arousal, creating a reinforcing cycle. </p><p>However, the impact of her attempts to get one over her friend was impossible to discount. It wasn’t even an assumption, not when just the night before, I had seen just how far things could escalate during Carrie’s and Sarah’s twisted competition. </p><p>Not that I was complaining in any way, not with the benefits I was enjoying limitlessly. </p><p>And Naomi worked too hard to pull my attention back to the present, plunging her mouth down on my shaft, her toned breasts rubbing against my thighs as she did her best to increase the amount she was able to swallow, occasionally looking up to enjoy my towering height. </p><p>My shaft soon wrapped in the extreme tightness of her throat, enough to press her nose against my skin, a deepthroating performance I had not expected from an inexperienced virgin. Yet, despite all her clumsiness, she pushed through her limits relentlessly, swallowing the full length of my cock. </p><p>That achievement didn’t come without a cost, of course. It was earned with gags, coughs, and even the occasional tear as she pushed through the discomfort. Yet, when her nose finally touched my skin, she looked up, her brown eyes colored with satisfaction and victory. </p><p>“A good start,” I said. “Now, the important question. Can you handle the real thing?” </p><p>Despite the sudden flare of panic making her eyes widen, she managed to nod, showing her willingness to push for more, helped by the fact that she was dancing on the edge of orgasm for several minutes. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said as I grabbed her head, shifting my fingers so that her head wouldn’t hurt against the door. “Tap my leg three times if you want to stop,” I said, earning another nod. “Now, relax,” I ordered before I pushed my hips forward, impaling her throat, much faster than her earlier attempts. </p><p>Her lips stretched to the limit as she tried to accommodate my girth, her throat’s tightness a barrier I vanquish relentlessly. Her gags got louder, enough to echo against the walls. Her fingers sank into my thighs, enough to leave a mark, but since there was no tap, I continued enjoying her throat relentlessly. </p><p>She gagged and sputtered as my hips rocked back and forth, giving her no respite. As my own climax came closer, I doubted that I was capable of doing so in the first place, at least in terms of giving her a permanent one. I still pulled back once, giving her a chance to catch her breath as I slapped my shaft, glistening with her spit, to her cheek, only for her to moan in anticipation. </p><p>“Harder,” she moaned loudly after she caught her breath. “Fuck my throat harder!” Though, as she said so, her neck turned slightly, suggesting that her moans were more for the sake of our naughty audience than me. </p><p>Not that I had a problem with that detail, imagining the state of Sarah, her deficient black panties drenched with her juices as she diddled herself, fear of getting caught increasing her pleasure even further. </p><p>Naomi opened her mouth, and my shaft slid inside her warm mouth once more, impaling even more aggressively, but it only made her moan more. She choked and gagged, but I pushed, this time, allowing her no respite. Not when I was on the edge of exploding in the first place, each pump giving me a fresh wave of pleasure. </p><p>I only pulled back when I felt the explosion was inevitable, aiming at her beautiful face and firm tits, covering them with my cum, the white contrasting beautifully with her skin. She might have commented on it, but before she could do so, I knelt as well, putting my fingers at her wetness and teasing her knob. </p><p>Already on the edge of a climax, it took only a few seconds for her to tremble helplessly, hit by arousal. “So, what do you think about surprising your friend right now?” I whispered. </p><p>“P-perfect,” Naomi managed to answer between her coughs and trembles, trying to stay conscious with the flood of pleasure that invaded her whole being. Yet, she still managed to wear a playful smirk. </p><p>I smirked as I grabbed her waist, to prevent her from hitting on the floor once the door opened, only to come face to face with Sarah, sitting on the floor, busy fingering herself recklessly, her sexy panties already around her ankle.</p><p>Yet, her shock was nothing compared to Naomi’s gaze as she turned, expecting to catch a buxom blonde, only to find a jet-black-haired naked embodiment of sexiness. “Sarah,” she gasped, no need to hide her shock. </p><p>“Oops,” I said, not even bothering to fake concern as their gazes met, emotions rolling. I had no idea how the encounter would end, but there was one thing I was sure of. </p><p>It was going to be entertaining.</p>",

    "content": "<p>“What’s there to explain?” I asked mockingly even as I took a step back, a dark smirk on my face as I did my best to look threatening. She looked at me using the mirror, not even bothering to explain, her expression still sharp, but with no hint of panic. </p><p>“You’re no fun,” I chuckled as I closed in the distance once more, and spanked her ass, enjoying the moan that she let out, breaking her serious expression for a moment. Watching her panic at my ambiguous words and threatening attitude would have been amusing. </p><p>Pity that she was smart enough to realize that, at this point, I wouldn’t harm her needlessly. </p><p>“You’re a smart woman to manage the Empire for so long. Why don’t you try and guess my objective.” I smirked playfully. “I even have a reward for you if you can successfully guess.” </p><p>She said nothing for a moment, but the flicker of excitement in her eyes suggested she was very much interested in that reward. An interesting sense of priorities considering we were discussing her losing her throne, showing just how far she came to rely on me during these last few fateful days. </p><p>I looked at her, enjoying the way her eyelids were half-closed as she started thinking, her breasts moving gently as she breathed deep, still exhausted from our last encounter. “Why don’t you entertain me while you catch your breath,” I murmured as I flicked my hand, and her chains fell on the floor with a great crash, while I lay on the floor, enjoying the coldness of the stone against my burning skin. </p><p>“As you wish,” she murmured as she stood up slowly, but her speed had nothing to do with hesitation. The seductive sway of her body as she managed to push herself to her feet despite her trembling legs was all the evidence I needed. </p><p>The distance between us was barely two steps, yet she closed the distance with a lingering slowness, each step as beautiful as a dance move, alluring and sexy at the same time, her naked body enhancing the allure even more. </p><p>She was simply spectacular. </p><p>Yet, even as she stood above me, giving an interesting angle to her nudity, her expression was serious, no doubt thinking about my question. “You want me to work on something else?” she guessed as she slowly lowered herself. </p><p>“Technically correct, but it’s such an ancillary — benefit,” I said, interrupted by a moan as her hips arrived at my waist, pushing down. </p><p>“Really?” she asked, confused. </p><p>“Oh, yeah,” I answered. “I have several missions for you around the capital, but technically, it’s only viable you will have a lot of free time. I have a much more important reason for making you ‘disappear’ from the politics.” </p><p>Sapphire closed her eyes, her expression serious, yet that didn’t prevent her hips from starting to rock. Her hips were too beautiful to be left alone, so my hands rebelled until they came to land on their amazing expanse, enjoying their softness as she rocked her hips, riding me amazingly. </p><p>It was certainly a good idea to free her from the chains after everything that had happened. She danced on me to prove herself. </p><p>I busied myself by staring at the beautiful dance of her hips and the sway of her tits, all the while creating a comprehensive strategy that might have been completed against the other aspects of it. </p><p>Meanwhile, she had offered several possible reasons for my request, though almost all related to exact political fights in the Empire, relating the fights between the different factions. </p><p>Disappointing, I thought. Not because her ideas were stupid. On the other hand, they were clever, and reasonably thought-out — especially considering just how distracted she was by her beautiful multitasking. </p><p>It was disappointing, because they lacked imagination. Everything she had offered was firmly about palace politics, either to reduce the power of the certain factions, or taking control of them to prepare against the upcoming threat. </p><p>Yet, it wasn’t surprising, because it wasn’t the first time I was facing that lack of imagination, though, until the current moment, I always stood on the opposite side of it. The noble dark families exhibited the same lack of imagination even as I fought against them, allowing me to use novel, high-risk strategies with great effect.</p><p>They didn’t always succeed, of course, and some of them brought me too close to death for my comfort, but considering I had managed to take the position of a dark lord, it was clearly a workable strategy. </p><p>“Try to be more imaginative, beautiful,” I said to her even as I slapped her breast, giving her a jolt. One she appreciated greatly, if her moan was to be believed. </p><p>Her hips continued to move as she opened her eyes, pinning me under their beautiful blueness. “I don’t know?” she admitted. “Maybe a clue.” </p><p>“Only if you can earn it,” I commented with a smirk. She raised herself a bit, only to push herself down harder, impaling herself with my spear, her moan spectacular. Her hands landed on my chest, using it for balance as her hips started to rock in a spectacular manner, each passing second giving me a renewed jolt of pleasure. I said nothing as her hips danced and rotated at a masterful pace, each push giving a renewed push of pleasure. </p><p>“Not bad,” I murmured even as she closed her eyes to contain the rush of pleasure she was generating for herself. “Certainly enough to get a clue. Tell me, how do you make two dragons fight?” </p><p>“You want to make those mysterious enemies fight?” she suggested after a while, though her voice lacked confidence.  </p><p>“Exactly.” </p><p>“But how?” she asked. “Why would they care about my sudden disappearance. If they thought who’s occupying the throne was important, they wouldn’t have set all those wards.” </p><p>“You’re not wrong, but you’re missing something important. They might not care about who’s occupying the throne, but that doesn’t mean they won’t react to a sudden, violent assassination that ruins their plans. After all, who else but their biggest enemies could achieve something without their notice.” </p><p>“You want them to panic,” she said, a sudden realization appearing on her face. “But isn’t it dangerous?” </p><p>“Oh, it certainly is,” I said. “But it isn’t as dangerous as allowing you to walk around the palace, especially with their ability to easily penetrate the wards. In the palace, you’re just waiting until they make a decision to remove you, and it’s impossible to prevent it, even if I stay guarding you always.” </p><p>“And how does taking me from the throne help. Wouldn’t they just do the same thing to Aria?” </p><p>“Not if we don’t put her on the throne immediately. You can go tell her that you’re going for a secret mission, and she can delay the coronation.” </p><p>“She can’t handle it,” Sapphire said dismissively. “She lacks the confidence to deal with any noble that would push for a quick decision. She’s just too weak.” </p><p>I smirked at her dismissal, curious how she would react if she knew Aria’s achievements under more positive reinforcement. However, as much as talking about that had entertainment potential, we were dealing with more important issues. “That’s even better. Tell her that you’re going on a mission, and ask her to stay in mourning. With her reputation, they wouldn’t care, and defending her in a secret location would have been much easier.” </p><p>“Will you protect her?” she asked, worried. </p><p>“Don’t worry, I won’t make you sad,” I said as I caressed her cheek. Of course, I had no intention of sacrificing my precious Aria regardless of our relationship, but considering my loving words made her move even quicker, sending shivers of pleasure across my body, I was more than willing to omit that part for a better reward. </p><p>“And how does doing something like that help us catch those mysterious enemies.” </p><p>“It’ll force them to act. Imagine you’re a dragon, eyeing a juicy deer, but before you can hunt it, it disappears suspiciously close to the den of another dragon. What would you do?” </p><p>“Blame the other dragon,” she said, her eyes wide in realization. </p><p>“Exactly. Currently, both parties are confident that they have a better understanding of what’s going on. One of them expanding their power in Dark Lands, while the other exerting their power to control the palace and the Empire without being noticed.” </p><p>“I understand why the elves would react badly to my disappearance, but why should phoenixes care about my disappearance since they knew they are not responsible.” </p><p>“That’s the beautiful part. How can they be confident that one of their team is responsible for that activity? And even if they could ascertain that, they would suspect elves acting because they are moving toward whatever end-game they are playing for, forcing them to react. Either case, they would make a lot of unplanned moves, allowing me to understand more about their plans.” </p><p>“I see,” she murmured between her moans, fascinated. “And what I’m going to do?” </p><p>“You’re going to help me, of course,” I said even as I slapped her ass. “With things quickening, we’ll need to act a lot faster, and someone I could trust would help me a lot.” </p><p>All I needed to decide, was who was going to help her that…</p>",

    "content": "<p>“Good morning,” I answered even as I gazed toward the woman that had forced me to take such a dangerous risk of infiltrating such a well-defended location. </p><p>It would be a lie to say I wasn’t tempted to teach her just how bad of an idea was to blackmail me to the point of forcing me to take such a big risk, but her power, radiating with overwhelming strength despite its soft nature made such a path foolish. </p><p>Not because I was afraid of her in a battle. With the soft feeling of her magic suggesting that she wasn’t exactly geared for combat, I was confident that I could defeat her in a few seconds. With my developing skills, I was confident that I could take down any other sorcerer in a fair fight. </p><p>The months I had spent increasing my control and magical expertise in such a suffocating location, hunting ethereal beasts and combating disaster beasts more than once was not garbage. The days that I had to risk everything for a deadly gambit even in an environment that heavily favored me to even have a fighting chance against a sorcerer were long gone. </p><p>Yet, combat was not an option even if my assumption was correct, and I could take her down in just a couple of seconds. A magical battle, even between two ordinary mages, would have triggered the wards. Between two sorcerers… </p><p>The word spectacle would have been inadequate. </p><p>And with the immediate solution that would have been provided by violence gone, I turned my attention to the smug expression of the foreign sorceress and her environment, trying to decide on the best way to open that discussion.  </p><p>My first focus was her room, furnished opulently. A huge, four-poster bed stood on the corner, the sheets giving the unique shine of silk. A magical variant, even, radiating a subtle sense of mana, while the bedpost had quite a generous amount of silver decorations on its dark mahogany surface, turning it into a beautiful spectacle. </p><p>The rest of the room was decorated no less opulently. Comprehensively, the decor was even more impressive than the guest rooms I had been visiting for the latter half of the night, occupied by the other nobles. The dress she was wearing, a long, flowing silk nightie, just reinforced the impression of noble decadence further. </p><p>The only exception was a desk, and not due to its expensive nature. It was filled with a careless pile of papers, some crumbled, some piling high enough to create a hazard. </p><p>Not that it changed one important thing. The thick wards around the room, along with the rest of the security measures, told one inevitable fact. She was a prisoner, one that was treated nicely, but a prisoner nonetheless. </p><p>“So, are you here for another healing session?” she said, her lips quirked in amusement. A beautiful sight, and her soft, slight accent, accentuated the words in a manner I wasn’t familiar with. “You should be more careful about venomous monsters.”  </p><p>“Maybe,” I answered, unable to prevent a matching smile from appearing on my lips. Being blackmailed was not fun, but, I had to admit, if I was going to be blackmailed, sexy exotic beauty with a sense of humor — and daring required to use it against a potentially hostile sorcerer — was not the worst option.</p><p>I could imagine much worse deals. </p><p>Of course, from her relaxed attitude, it was clear that she didn’t miss the significance of my presence. If I wasn’t interested in cooperating with her — even if that was under her implied threat — I would have just abandoned the city rather than going all the required effort to sneak into her room. </p><p>Once again, I let the silence stretch as I looked at her foreign beauty, appreciating the contrast between her black hair and fair skin, before peering into her eyes, their sharper angles adding a subtle sense of danger to her look — not that I needed their warning. </p><p>Not with the magic radiating off her casually, still impressive despite its soft nature. </p><p>I waited for her to say anything else, opening with her requests and needs. It was a simple negotiating trick. In any deal, information always meant power, and speaking first meant giving up some of that power. Deliberate silence was a way to leverage that, because most people reflexively tried to fill that silence, which made them reveal their needs and requests. </p><p>However, as the silence stretched, a small smile appeared on her lips, showing that she was not inexperienced enough to fall for that trick. If the circumstances were different, I might have tested her patience for several minutes, but considering I was the one under the immediate time pressure, it was hardly the most viable strategy. </p><p>I had no choice but to start our negotiations from a point of disadvantage. And just to rub vinegar to my wound, it was against a literal prisoner. </p><p>How fun. </p><p>“I’m guessing you’re going to ask for your freedom to cooperate,” I asked. </p><p>“No,” she said, though her smile suggested it was just a part of her counterargument rather than a categoric rejection of our deal. “That’s the price for keeping my mouth shut about your little secret,” she answered. </p><p>“That’s not a bad deal,” I answered, as her silence about my secrets was the only thing I needed from her. As much as being a healer was convenient, I was not exactly incompetent in that aspect. </p><p>“Oh, really, heretic,” she said, the last word with a suspicious emphasis. I had no idea why she called me a heretic, nor did she feels it was a relevant part of our discussion. I just assumed it was about her land of origin and their beliefs. </p><p>Then, I noticed she was looking at a particular location in my body as she said so. The center of my chest, where my sorcerer core was located. If it just had been just that, I might have also assumed it was just about my identity as a sorcerer, but her gaze slipped to my right arm immediately after. </p><p>The arm that was currently going through a transformation under the effects of the Dragon’s Heart continued to plague me. </p><p>“I see,” I murmured. I could have acted stupid, but clearly, she had not only recognized what I had done to myself — which didn’t surprise me as she had easily detected it during her healing attempts — but also the long-term implications and my inability to stop it. I had no idea why that made her call me a heretic, but that part, I let slide. I had bigger problems than that. “And you can help me with that.” </p><p>That question, she didn’t give an answer. At least, not with her words. Instead, she flicked a finger, and a pile of paper floated off her desk, and hit the floor in front of me. </p><p>I froze as I looked at the contents of it, as each piece of paper was filled with information about dragon hearts. “I see,” I murmured with a sigh as I cycled through some of the papers, trying to absorb the content of the papers. </p><p>It was a veritable treasure of information, the kind that surpassed the scraps of information that I managed to find in Olivia’s private library. Some of those papers were old, their smell suggesting that their age was easily measured in centuries, each containing information about dragon hearts. Some were just legends and basic theories, the kind I was able to find in the library, only more detailed. </p><p>Some papers were much more detailed, giving a much more detailed breakdown of the possible ways of using them, their potential side effects, other dangers, and even some theories about their origins, though there was nothing conclusive about the last aspect.</p><p>Yet, their value was nothing compared to the other half of the papers, the ones that lacked the acrid smell of ancient parchment. Some of them were filled with research comparing various theories about dragon hearts, from their origin to their impact, trying to understand which ancient source had the necessary reliability, each sentence more precious than gold for me. </p><p>However, even those couldn’t be compared to some of the other papers, filled with experimental notes about the effects and destructive impact of dragon hearts on ordinary people and mages, with some theoretical calculations of how it might be extrapolated to sorcerers. </p><p>Unfortunately, unlike the others, those experimental notes were useless to me. Not because the information that was contained was useless to me, but because I lacked the necessary expertise to understand their intricacies. It required a true master of healing arts of understanding them. </p><p>… or write them in the first place, I thought. I didn’t miss the fact that every single of those new notes was written by the same hand. Soft, gentle writing, with a beauty that I had never seen in simple writing, each letter soft, yet carrying a surprising sense of presence. </p><p>A familiar sensation, I thought as I glanced at the sorceress that was blackmailing me, before glancing at her desk, a half-written paper with a brush next to it enough to confirm she was the author. </p><p>How interesting. No wonder it took only seconds for her to not only discover my deepest secret, but also understand the full implications of the Dragon Heart I carried in my core. </p><p>“What is your decision, heretic?” she asked after a minute, and I glanced at her, unable to hide my sigh, preparing for negotiation in that I was the losing party for the first time.</p>",

    "content": "<p>After I pulled myself out of the ice bath, I felt refreshed, with several hours I could use for my needs. </p><p>Technically, I had classes, but as a football player, the attendance was even more optional than it normally was. </p><p>If I was just another ordinary player with no concerns other than which cheerleader to seduce after the game, I would have lazed around the hot tub for a while — enjoying the top-of-the-line facilities that cost several million dollars to renovate — before going to the meeting room and start studying the tactics. </p><p>Yet, I didn’t have the option to enjoy such decadence. I simply didn’t have the luxury to waste time. Not with the mystery of the cult and the system knocking on my door as a threat. </p><p>I needed more information. </p><p>Unfortunately, a magical fire and a disappearing cult were clues a touch hotter than I would prefer to follow more directly. I had no intention of putting myself in a risky situation just to gather more information. </p><p>Unfortunately, my other possible information source, my guide, had lost her already shaky credibility by not only recklessly pushing me into a very dangerous situation, but putting herself in a coma just by trying to extinguish a fire. </p><p>I preferred to follow safer options. </p><p>And, currently, I had only one clue I could follow that could be classified as safe. </p><p>The mysterious orb that started all. </p><p>So, after one last shower, I went to my car and started driving to the museum, my mind already on the best strategy to handle such research. </p><p>My resignation from my part-time job had been already processed, which revoked my database access, but that wasn’t a big loss. I had already read all the information that could be accessed through my credentials — which, considering I was just a part-time student, wasn’t impressive in the first place. </p><p>Luckily, being a computer engineering student, I was prepared for such a situation, and had installed a keylogger to the main computer, giving me several administrative access IDs. I hadn’t used those IDs for anything other than adjusting the work schedule for my benefit for emergencies, but it was time to put them to better use. </p><p>I pulled into the parking lot with a determined expression, gazing around to check if there was anything suspicious. Luckily, even in the middle of the day, the museum was hardly the most popular spot of Sunset College. Ultimately, it existed merely to allow the college to brag about its commitment to culture while spending as little money as possible. </p><p>There was one time it was crowded, and that was the admission season, when the students decided to visit their safety college. </p><p>I ignored the visitor area, taking the corridor that would bring me to the back end of the museum, where both the warehouse and the employee area rested. Normally, it would require an access card, but after working there for a year, I knew exactly how to open the door without it as well. </p><p>I just hoped I could pass there before anyone could notice my presence. </p><p>That failed, however, when a voice called to me before I could disappear. A familiar voice, I recognized, though not one I expected to hear here. “Excuse me, this is an employee-only area,” she said. I turned, only to see a black-haired beauty looking at me, her eyes widening as she noticed me.  </p><p>“Hey, Lauren,” I said with a smirk. “Long time no see.” It was surprising to see my opponent from the chess tournament here, especially since she wasn’t a student of our college. Even more surprisingly, she was at the reception, wearing a pencil skirt and a white blouse, only her casual ponytail preventing her from looking like a quintessential secretary from the seventies. </p><p>It was a beautiful sight.  </p><p>“Not that long unless you’re having memory problems,” she said with a frown, her tone surprisingly abrasive. “The tournament was just yesterday.” </p><p>“It must be the merciless beating I had received,” I said, then, hit her with a charming smirk. “Either that, or it was torture of not seeing your beautiful face for such a long time.” </p><p>“Jerk,” she murmured, but she failed the edges of her mouth to tug momentarily. </p><p>I had to admit, the sight of her fighting against a smile — unsuccessfully, I might add — was a beautiful sight, one that I could spend quite a bit of my time enjoying if it wasn’t for the urgency of the situation. Instead, I asked the most important question. “What are you doing here?” </p><p>At my words, she looked determined, pushing her chest proudly, unaware of just how much that pushed her white blouse to create a beautiful view in the process, stretching its capabilities to maintain a stable impression. </p><p>I bit a teasing remark despite its amusement potential. It was best not to anger her too much before I got what I needed. I could always tease her on the way back. </p><p>“I took your advice and start working for my dream,” she said proudly. </p><p>“Really?” I asked. “And your family is alright with that?” </p><p>“Not really, but I don’t care. I said them that I don’t need their money and left home.” Then, she glanced around dismissively. “Unfortunately, this is the only museum I could work part-time as an art history major that’s reasonably close to my own school.”</p><p>She sounded proud about her decisive move with her family, but considering not only she was able to find work in less than a day, but they had processed it and allowed her to start working despite not being from our college, it might not as effective as she had thought. </p><p>Bureaucracy never worked that fast, not without someone influential oiling the wheels. </p><p>I kept my mouth shut. I had too many things going on to involve myself in the fight between a girl and her family. Her clearly rich family. </p><p>And her clothes confirmed that her relationship with her family wasn’t exactly terminated either. I wasn’t an expert on fashion, but my gaze was sharp enough to notice expensive clothes, and hers certainly belonged to that category. I couldn’t see any brand, but at that level, it implied they were even more expensive. </p><p>I decided to focus on a less important topic first. “So, how is your first day?” I said. “I knew the museum can be boring.” </p><p>She frowned. “Not as good as I hoped. They are adamant that I have to work at the front desk for a full month before they even allowed me to take a step into the warehouse without supervision. I didn’t even get a tour of it. And receptionist work is boring.”</p><p>Interesting, I thought, because I knew for a fact that there was no such rule. It sounded suspicious like a rich family might insist on a job they had arranged for their daughter, hoping that she would get bored sooner than later.   </p><p>I neglected to mention to her that. “Hey, it’s a job,” I said with a shrug, before hitting her with a seductive smirk, enjoying the sudden blush on her face. “How about I give you that tour instead?” </p><p>“You?” she asked, her tone surprised. </p><p>“Hey, no need to sound that shocked. Just because I’m on a football team doesn’t mean I have no culture.” </p><p>The shameful blush that appeared on her face was simply beautiful. “No! I didn’t mean it like—“ she started, but I cut her off with a chuckle. </p><p>“Hey, just joking. I had been working there for more than a year. It’s certainly enough to give a tour.”</p><p>“Jerk,” she murmured, blushing. </p><p>I just smirked. “Why don’t you come with me and I give you a tour.” </p><p>She looked tempted, especially as she threw a glance at the empty area. “I can’t, not on my first day,” she said. </p><p>“Sure, the offer is open,” I said with a wink. “Whenever you want, I’m under your orders. Now, why don’t you open the entrance so I can go to the back office.”  </p><p>That earned a suspicious glance. “Where’s your entry card, if you had been working here?” she asked. </p><p>“I just resigned yesterday,” I explained. “Between the football team and the chess, I simply don’t have time.” </p><p>“Football,” she said, her face crunching. “I still don’t understand why you should bother with that barbarian activity.” </p><p>I just smiled. Considering I wanted her to do something for me, I kept my mouth shut about the near-uselessness of chess as an income source. “Hey, you have your objectives, and I have mine,” I said instead.  </p><p>“If you say so,” she said.  </p><p>“So, how about that tour,” I said, letting my smile widen. I needed her permission to slip to the back-office. And, spending some time with a sexy girl dressed as a secretary was hardly a chore. </p><p>“I don’t know …” she murmured as she looked around. “I can’t exactly leave the reception. What if someone comes. It’s my first day.” Yet, I could see her voice slipping. </p><p>I was about to insist, telling her that it was not going to be a big deal, when my phone buzzed. It was a call from Megan. I rejected the call.  </p><p>“As you wish,” I said. “But how about you let me go so I could pick my stuff, and I give you that tour tomorrow, after your shift? Or, here’s my number. Just give me a call when you want that tour…” I said, letting my words linger as I hit her with a seductive smirk. “Or, whenever you want…” </p><p>“Jerk!” she growled as she slapped my shoulder, but that didn’t prevent her from blushing cutely. And, to handle her sudden shame, she walked back to her desk, opening the door for me. </p>",

    "content": "<p>The sight Dalia created as she leaned over the table ‘carelessly’  as she put together a plate for me was beautiful even without factoring the way her dress failed against the attraction of the gravity. And the way her breasts continued to defy that attraction determinedly just enhanced the view further, competed by a momentary glimpse of her nipples, beautifully hard in anticipation. </p><p>Even as I enjoyed the sight, however, a stab of annoyance remained. </p><p>After all, with her level low enough to give me that dreaded notification once more, there was no additional experience to make the moment even sweeter. </p><p>I kept my mouth shut, ignoring that annoyance as I did my best to look dominated under her alluring assault. </p><p>Instead, I focused on the next issue. I had no idea about the exact skill configuration she had, which meant I had no idea exactly how accurate her observation was to catch the truth behind my actions. And since I was at a point that didn’t require taking any big risks, I decided to act conservatively. Not that I expected her to actually succeed in her observations, as there was a limit to the number of skills she could take, and if her level was low enough, she could hardly get enough observation skills in place to catch me. </p><p>Not with the number of skills she already had to optimize her seduction capability. </p><p>“T-thank you,” I stammered as she put the plate in front of me — and giving an even more impressive glimpse of her cleavage in the process. My mouth gaping, I did my best to give her the reaction she was working for, thoroughly enjoying being on the other side of such a radical seduction attempt. </p><p>As she pulled back, she dragged her finger ‘accidentally’ over my hand, unaware that she had given me the opportunity to slip a single point of mana into her body by doing so, giving me the opportunity I was looking for to examine her soul space safely. </p><p>A single point of mana wasn’t enough to get a complete understanding, but since I was unaware of just how many magical talents she possessed at the moment, I decided to stay on the safe side. </p><p>And it turned out to be a smart thing to do, because her current skill set was roughly divided into three distinct categories. </p><p>The first group was, quite predictably, seduction, which didn’t come as a surprise thanks to her already displayed abilities. The second category was geared for magical ability, mostly Arcana with some enchanting support, making me glad that I didn’t get too aggressive to analyze her soul space. The combination of magical skills she had would work well to catch a magical flare, especially combined with her remaining skills.  </p><p>The last category was enhanced observation. Though, surprisingly, that part was not as strong as I expected considering her objective, leaving her very capable of catching magical tricks, but less capable of catching the mundane tricks. </p><p>Interesting, I thought. Maybe she was convinced that she had already seen my secrets. Or maybe, was more afraid of me using a magical trick on her. Yet, that thought wasn’t enough to prevent a momentary frown, because that wasn’t enough to explain her choice. </p><p>The limited observation, along with her magical focus, was certainly suspicious, leaving me with one important question.  </p><p>Why she had decided to maintain such a high level of magical ability? Her still being afraid of me was an option, but it was certainly not enough.  It was the case, she would have maintained at least one weapon skill and some physical stats to prevent a more direct attack, yet those were completely absent. </p><p>Another change in the already complicated game her boss was playing, enough to make me tense. </p><p>Yet, as I watched Delia taking the chair nearest to me, I decided to leave that question to a different time. It was impossible to get an answer to every single question, after all. </p><p>Luckily, the way she crossed her legs, enhancing her already impressive slit even further to was beautiful enough to compensate for the mission-related annoyance.</p><p>I let my gaze fall on the amazing length of her legs, enjoying the delicious sight, happy that the role I was playing allowed me to do so without bothering to hide my gaze. She threw a dismissive yet amused glare my way, thinking I was too distracted with her legs to notice it. </p><p>How amusing, I thought, enjoying her silence as I took the first bite from the delicious breakfast spread that had been prepared for me. “Amazing,” I said after swallowing. </p><p>“I’m happy to hear that,” she answered with a teasing slowness. The soft giggle that followed showed she had no intention of hiding that teasing intention. </p><p>Not that it was possible to hide that intention in the first place. </p><p>She said nothing to follow her words while I enjoyed the food, the fork occasionally freezing in place when she shuffled slightly to give an even better view of her beautiful body, the impressions enhanced further by her seduction-based skills. </p><p>Since I was supposed to be shocked by her beauty too much to actually speak, I said nothing else, not that it was too much of a problem with the perfect view of her entire leg peeking through the slit of her dress. </p><p>The contrast of her flawless skin against the crimson dress was simply mesmerizing. </p><p>My gaze danced between her amazing cleavage and her stunning legs, curves battling with smoothness, occasionally straying higher to get a glimpse of her slender neck. </p><p>When she spoke once more, I had been enjoying the sight of her deep cleavage for quite a while. She had raised her arms to reach something, ‘coincidentally’ covering her cleavage for a moment, and I leaned deliberately to catch a better view. </p><p>“Sorry,” she said with a growing smile. “I'm not in your way, am I?\" </p><p>“Uh… No,” I said, once again making a show of stammering like I had been just caught reaching for the cookie jar. Yet, I didn’t stop staring at her body, showing her that the temptation of her body was stronger than the shame her words generated. </p><p>I was really curious about what was driving her to such a thing, so I did everything I could do other than actually saying to her directly I was hooked.</p><p>Yet, she kept her mouth shut, not taking the opportunity to mock me, which made me even more curious about what was the objective of this surprise breakfast. Why was she delaying it that much when I was giving her all the indications that I was ready to eat out of her hand? </p><p>And when she spoke, it wasn’t to unravel that mystery. “Have you tried the honey pastries, they are truly delicious,” she whispered even as she stood, preparing me on another plate. </p><p>Since when she sat down once more, she pulled her chair even closer, enough ‘carelessly’ to extend her hand to my lap, I assumed that pastries were just an excuse. </p><p>Her playful smile was masterful, naughty, yet with enough innocence mixed in to convince a lesser man that her touch might not mean what he thought it would, keeping things in suspense, which was more difficult to manage than it sounded. </p><p>It was too easy to look condescending while trying to give such a complicated impression. </p><p>I leaned forward even as I took a bite from the pastries they had picked for me, following it with a gulp of tea. And just as she said, they were delicious, but that wasn’t all that. </p><p>They were also poisonous!</p><p>What an interesting choice, I thought even as I carefully flared my magic internally to grab the offending liquid that had been in the heart of the pastry, one that was only started working when it was combined with the touch of the tea, wrapping it safely, all without Delia noticing. </p><p>Despite the subtle web of magic that started spreading from her a few seconds later. </p><p>That magic, along with the subtle tightening of her face finally revealed the reason for her magical skill selection, at least partially. She wanted to make sure I had been affected by whatever poison she had fed to me.  </p><p>Too bad for her she had woefully mistaken about the limits of my magical skills. I had managed to trick people that were much more competent than her magically, both in terms of level and skill focus, and in terms of magical dedication. </p><p>[-94 Mana]</p><p>I was able to shield the mana flare even as I cast a Biomancy spell, amused by the fact that she was unaware that she had tried to poison a Biomancy master, which was, arguably, an even worse attempt to poison a healer, like Marianne. </p><p>Not that Marianne would have a problem negating the effects of the poison, but I doubted she could compete with me in terms of analyzing the poison. So, by a flare of magic, not only I was able to block whatever plan Delia had by poisoning me, but also I would understand how the poison would exactly to destroy her plan even further. </p><p>I acted like there was nothing extraordinary going on as I took another pastry, once again followed by the tea to understand how it was working. </p><p>Luckily, it wasn’t a deadly poison, which gave me a reason to hold back any aggressive response.  </p><p>Although, not using a deadly poison wasn’t a huge surprise. Even if they wanted to kill me, Poison was hardly a reliable tool to deal with anyone higher than level ten due to a combination of high HP — though due to low Constitution, mages were more vulnerable against such methods even in high levels. </p><p>Even for mages, however, there were very few poisons that could reliably kill a level twenty mage, especially ones that could be delivered without excruciating pain to warn about their presence. </p><p>Her lack of a reaction as I continued to eat calmly suggested that the poison she had used wasn’t one of those destructive ones, confirming I had sufficient time to work on the poison. </p><p>For others, deciphering the nature of an unknown poison was difficult without any tools, I had two distinct advantages over other experts. One, my great magical abilities that included Biomancy, second, my high Constitution and HP, giving me the freedom to let the poison affect me slightly, testing the poison through its workings as well as its magical nature. </p><p>With that, before I even finished eating the second pastry, I was able to identify the nature of her trick, only to realize classifying it as the poison was pushing. </p><p>It was more accurate to define it as concentrated alcohol, mixed with some mild aphrodisiac, the dosage perfect to affect a caster with low Constitution and a high level. </p><p>The perfect combination to impair an already horny high-leveled mage’s decision-making even further without turning collapsing them. </p><p>How interesting.</p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 32 Experience: 499110 / 528000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6528 / 6528 Mana: 6720 / 8000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [77/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>",

    "content": "<p>It was not without a reason that I was not glowing with happiness even as the first stage of my grand experimentation was a success, and I had identified why my mana had worked much better than the others to contain Divine Spark. </p><p>Tantric. </p><p>In a way, that was obvious considering it was only after receiving that ability I was able to help the ladies that shared my affection in many different ways, from easily refilling their mana in an efficiency that was impossible to copy to help them level up directly.</p><p>However, from a different perspective, it was dangerously damning. Because, until the Divine Spark, everything I had done was somehow related to the System. It was easy to write off the impact of the Tantric as a transitory success, allowing me to achieve something that could be also achieved by the others, just more smoothly. </p><p>The number of high-leveled combatants the Eternals were able to create in bulk certainly supported that conclusion. </p><p>Yet, as I looked at the Divine Spark of light smashing against the walls of its Tantric prison helplessly despite the power it contained, I couldn’t help but think I had underestimated that particular skill. </p><p>Tantric was much more mysterious than just making mana softer and easier to control. </p><p>The question, I thought even as I looked at the fragment of Divine Spark, helplessly pushing against its special container, why I had made that mistake despite the obvious implications on the way. I should have noticed that sooner, I thought for a while, only to abandon that track. </p><p>Before I could delve deep, a more important detail distracted me. </p><p>The Divine Spark was calming down! </p><p>With a frown, I turned my attention toward the imprisoned Divine Spark, trying to understand why it was slowing down. For a scary moment, I was afraid it had some kind of consciousness, therefore realizing the futility of its escape, but luckily, that intimidating thought was invalidated easily, because the Spark continued to lose speed at a very steady pace. </p><p>Then, I noticed the brightness of the Spark was decreasing alongside its aggressive bouncing, giving me another interesting probability. Tantric mana was somehow destroying the Divine Spark, which, interestingly, no less scarier than my earlier theories. </p><p>As I watched, I corrected my assumption once more. Divine Spark wasn’t being destroyed, but transforming. Its brightness and aggressiveness were disappearing, leaving a much calmer concept behind, one that was much easier to transform. </p><p>It was hard to define the remaining energy. It was certainly not another source of mana, not even close. It was still an energy of the same intensity. It wouldn’t be wrong to call it Divine Spark. </p><p>One thing was certain. It wasn’t the Divine Spark of Light anymore. </p><p>Somehow, Tantric was able to get rid of the unique nature of Divine Spark, leaving only the pure energy behind. “So, that was why I could absorb Divine Spark to empower myself while the Headmistress is suffering for centuries,” I noted after taking the risk of absorbing the transformed Spark, feeling a small yet noticeable improvement in my body. </p><p>I repeated the experiment a couple of times, only to notice the more intense the Tantric qualities of the mana I pushed, the quicker the transformation process was, removing any doubt whether the Tantric skill that was responsible. </p><p>Fascinating. </p><p>I would have loved to continue experimenting, but after a few more tests, I had managed to deplete all the Divine Spark I had managed to pilfer from the headmistress — though luckily, didn’t let it go to waste, most of it going to my body to reinforce it further while the some consumed by the System, hopefully enough to avoid further embargo to my leveling. With that, I needed to stop the experimentation until the next day.  </p><p>Unfortunately, that didn’t mean I was free to do whatever I wanted until the next day. I still had to visit the experimentation room that was built for me by the courtesy of the Princess, not to mention I needed to reveal the mystery behind her aide’s sudden level up and change of skills. Yet, as I summoned my air elemental once more, I couldn’t help but sigh exhaustedly. I was trying to deal with too many different things. </p><p>Getting strong had its own disadvantages. </p><p>After another travel, I was back at Silver Spires, walking toward the temporary Royal residence once more, curious whether I could integrate the discovery about the impact of the Tantric Mana on the storage artifact I was trying to create — though that would have been challenging to do without being caught by one of the many spying wards and spells they had integrated into the room. </p><p>“Please sir, this way,” said the guard, a marked difference from the way they had greeted me the day prior. Clearly, their instructions had been renewed. “Lady Dalia is waiting for you at her rooms for breakfast before you start working, sir.” </p><p>“Excellent,” I said, nodding to the guard before I walked inside, following a maid who led me to another corridor, until she opened a door, and revealing an opulent room — too opulent, even, especially considering that it was a temporary room. </p><p>“Please take a seat, sir, Lady Delia must be here in a minute,” she said, waiting at the door, waiting for me to get inside before she closed the door. Interestingly, she stayed outside, leaving me alone in the room. </p><p>Interesting choice, I thought even I glanced around the room, taking a more detailed record of the opulent scene. Yet, as I glanced carefully, at my Perception, it didn’t take long to realize the opulence was more of a foil than actual richness. </p><p>The golden statue on the corner was just gold-plated, the silverware that radiated a sense of magic, but it was not a permanent enchantment or enhanced during forging, but just a simple spell to fake value, though it was good enough to avoid my attention if I hadn’t been looking carefully. </p><p>And they were not the only detail. Every single painting in the room, every piece of furniture, every plate was enhanced with spells, spells that had been cast just minutes ago. To their credit, they were cast expertly, more than enough to trick anyone that didn’t have my phenomenal Stats and breadth of magical abilities. </p><p>They were fake nonetheless. </p><p>Luckily, the delicious spread of breakfast food that covered the table was not fake, filling my nose with its delicious smell. It was certainly a feast worthy of the Royal family. Interestingly, there was no maid to serve the food — not that I cared about it, but it was an interesting break from the image of opulence they were trying to reflect. </p><p>When another door opened, and Delia entered, I understood the reason. “Sorry for the delay,” the busty blonde said as she entered the room, wearing a beautiful dress, one that was far too revealing to be appropriate wear. It was a delicious red dress, with a cleavage deep enough to reveal she wasn’t wearing a corset, along with a deep slit that covered the side of the dress that implied the same for her panties. </p><p>Yet, despite the beauty of the sight, it wasn’t the thing that caught my attention. </p><p>No, it was the notification I had received. </p><p>[Level Difference of five or more! No Experience]</p><p>What an interesting development, realizing that her level had changed once more, this time dropping below the target. I couldn’t help but feel curious about which skills I would find once I tapped into her soul space. </p><p>“N-not a problem,” I said, making a show of stammering as I let my gaze stuck on what her deep cleavage was displaying, deep enough to reveal the ghost of her areolas, my attention enough to deepen her smile. </p><p>With the way she dressed, her reaction was hardly a surprise. </p><p>“Still, my apologies,” she whispered throatily as she walked forward, her hips shaking beautifully with each step, the allure radiating off her almost taking a physical presence, to a level that would have been impossible without significant assistance from her Charisma, one that was enhanced further by a few select skills. “I shouldn’t have kept such an exalted guest waiting.” </p><p>I couldn’t wait to discover the exact configuration of skills she had to display such an aura of seduction. </p><p>I gulped loudly. “N-nonsense,” I stammered even as I took a step back, doing my best to look shocked, curious just how far she would push in her little game, and whether I could ferret out the reason why she had escalated her seduction game. </p><p>“Whatever you say,” she said, her smile confident as she leaned forward over the table to reach a plate, enhancing her already scandalous cleavage even more. “Let me prepare a plate for you…” </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 32 Experience: 499110 / 528000 </p><p>Strength: 46 Charisma: 63</p><p>Precision: 40 Perception: 42</p><p>Agility: 40 Manipulation: 45</p><p>Speed: 39 Intelligence: 49</p><p>Endurance: 39 Wisdom: 51</p><p>HP: 6528 / 6528 Mana: 8000 / 8000 ]</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master Elemental [100/100] </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100] </p><p>Master Subterfuge [100/100] </p><p>Master Craft [77/100]</p><p>Expert Speech [75/75]</p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (0/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 22/26]</p><p>[Helga - Level 22/26]</p>",

    "content": "<p>“So, do you want to come, or would you prefer peeking from the corner,” I asked as I looked at Penny, who was still behind the door, watching me from the slight crack that was letting a ray of light in.</p><p>The expression of shock that passed through her face, replacing her earlier impatient jealously, made her even cuter. Not to mention the fact that she believed that it was an adequate hiding method, enough to keep her obscured from my gaze… </p><p>It was easy to forget just how silly and clumsy she could be when excited, then she went and did something like that, reminding me why I should never let her work with another photographer under any circumstances, no matter how attractive that might be for the fledgling business I was building to have models with better visibility. </p><p>“Come on, open the door, and show me the surprise you clearly worked hard to prepare,” I whispered, earning a shy whimper, one beautiful enough to awaken my manhood even after its great exertion earlier. </p><p>From the crack on the door, I could see Penny’s blush growing gently, putting a big smile on my face in the process as well, amazed how she could act this shy after her earlier daringness, allowing me to complete a beautiful milestone much faster than I had been planning. </p><p>Yet, when she pushed the door open, revealing her surprise, I couldn’t help but look at her with widened eyes. “Naughty girl,” I murmured as I looked at her, my gaze slowly lingering from bottom to top. </p><p>I was surprised by the way she dressed, especially since I wasn’t expecting anything extraordinary in the first place. I had an accurate understanding of each item of clothing they had available — as while I thoroughly enjoyed the trip, ultimately, I didn’t forget that I was a professional. </p><p>The most I expected her to mix and match their costumes to create a new show. Not that it would have been a horrible option, as Penny stuffed in a costume that was barely a fit for Nancy in the first place would have looked amazing. </p><p>She went in a different direction. </p><p>She had found a long strip of red cloth in the room, barely half as wide as my hand. Since she had arrived with a bottle of massage oil, I guessed it was a part of the massage equipment that came along with the expensive room. </p><p>Living in a classy suite definitely had its perks. Pity, it was a one-time perk.  </p><p>What she had done with that surprised me more than its existence. She had carefully wrapped it around her considerable bosom a couple of times, though she carefully kept the alignment askew to as not to cover the sight of her inviting flesh completely. Then, one of the hooks moved down from the left side, hooking under her torso to create primitive underwear, hiding her core from the view. </p><p>Yet, the real impact came from the large bow tie she had created, resting at the side of her alluring belly, turning the whole costume into a nice gift wrap. </p><p>“I see,” I said with a gentle smile, yet, rather than walking to her, I turned my back and walked to the living room. I expected her hesitant steps to follow me, but they were absent. So, just as I arrived at the doorway, I turned to her,  finding her expression replaced by fear and hesitancy. </p><p>“It’s a good start, but a present doesn’t just need to look good, you also need to think about how to present it,” I suggested to her. “So, why don’t you give it a little more thought and surprise me in the living room.” </p><p>Her expression changed once more as her shy determination asserted itself. She said nothing, just nodded slightly, while I turned and left her behind at the entrance of the bedroom, curious what she might create after the earlier show. </p><p>I still grabbed my camera, which had multiple reasons. Not only did I enjoy taking photos, after all, but also it worked wonders to make Penny relax even more, triggering her submissive traits under the physical representation of my authority. </p><p>While Penny stayed back to work on her presentation, I decided to help her a bit more. I went to the bathroom — the other, smaller one, another perk of the top-tier suite we were enjoying — to refresh and clean myself a bit, then I put on a fluffy bathrobe. </p><p>Then, I returned to the room and poured myself a glass of single-malt scotch, but didn’t immediately sit down. Instead, I walked around, turning certain lights on and dimming others, creating a nice lightning effect that could pass for professional-level, the focus on the doorway and the couch I planned to occupy. </p><p>After all, giving a little help to my sexy blonde wasn’t a horrible idea… </p><p>Then, I sat down and crossed my legs, appreciating the opportunity to rest a bit. After all, I had been up since the early morning, and not only did the day have a rather explosive start, and we had worked hard the whole day at the convention center, which was hardly the most relaxing day. </p><p>I leaned back, enjoying the comfort of the couch that was probably more expensive than a car. “Damn, I missed the luxury,” I murmured. A lot of people claimed that luxury was unnecessary, and just about vanity, but, unfortunately, it was just a lie told by the people who didn’t enjoy the true luxury. </p><p>Or maybe, I was just a vain asshole, but if that was the case, I had no intention of changing that. </p><p>At least, I was a lucky vain asshole, I decided as I looked around. Considering I was literally exiled from the peak of the industry in every way that mattered, I was still living rather well. Unfortunately, that amount of success could hardly open the path of the peak back to me, not with the clout of the people I had already angered. </p><p>Even worse, I could hardly see a way to climb back. Doing the fashion shoots of the third-rate local brands gave me some much-needed revenue to buy some new equipment, maybe even enough to rent a decent studio, but ultimately, those were hardly enough to break the barriers in an industry that worked exclusively on connections, favors, and reputation. </p><p>And my connections were all burned by a certain highly-known editor, I had no favors that could call. Even worse, my reputation was worse than nothing, a chain around my ankles. </p><p>“Damn,” I murmured as I shook my head, trying to dispel the sudden depression that threatened to overwhelm me. What a stupid mood to suddenly fall into between a spectacular threesome and waiting for a spectacular show from a sexy blonde wrapped in gift wrap. </p><p>I reached my phone, hoping to distract myself from the funk, only to find my phone flooded with notifications. </p><p>“How interesting,” I murmured as I went through the messages, asking for more and more photos of the girls in exchange for even more money. “Maybe there’s not just a way of doing business,” I murmured to myself even as I went through them. </p><p>Maybe I had underestimated the money I could make from those nerds. </p><p>‘Don’t worry, a new tier on the way, and here’s a teaser,’ I said before I posted two photos, one from Penny, the other from Nancy, both from the archives — not the private archives, of course, as they were exclusively for my own private ownership. They were just sexy poses, disguised enough to hide their identity. </p><p>Not that I would have shared them even if it wasn’t for the possessive streak I was developing. I had been caught flat-footed by the sudden interest they had shown for the extra, steamier photos — mostly because I didn’t factor in the extent of the allure of two sexy women for the people in the convention after they spent a whole day leering at them — but as a professional photographer, I was an expert on how to manage that. </p><p>Never give them what they truly wanted. </p><p>There was a reason most models never did nude photoshoots, and it was little to do with their sense of shame. I had worked the backstage enough to know just how ‘adventurous’ they could be behind closed doors to get better jobs to know that part didn’t deter them. </p><p>Yet, they avoided it, because a model’s allure came from the mystery it suggested as much as her beauty, and a fully nude, or even excessively revealing photoshoot went a long way to destroy that allure, even if doing so came with rather explosive benefits in the short term. </p><p>For that exact reason, I made sure that, even though I had shared some photos of them wearing some very sexy underwear, I had deliberately chosen the most obscure angles that just implied a sense of sexiness. </p><p>And the moment I did so, messages flooded in, displaying the awe of their beauty, while the subscriptions to higher tier skyrocketed, even better than I expected, earning me several thousand dollars in the process. </p><p>A promising start, but before I could truly focus on the implications, I noticed a movement at the doorway. </p><p>I raised my gaze, as it would be extremely rude to ignore Penny after asking her to prepare for my sake.</p>",

    "content": "<p>“That was … amazing,” Sapphire murmured softly, taking deep breaths, the chains around her arms the only thing that was keeping her trembling legs upright. Meanwhile, I took a step back, enjoying the way she was trembling in front of me. </p><p>“Not was, my sweet Queen,” I murmured even as my smirk widened. “You should be familiar enough with me to know that I had no intention of stopping here.” </p><p>“Promises, promises…” she whispered, her smile widening. I might have been surprised by the sudden change of attitude if it came from the other girls, but coming from Sapphire, it was rather understandable. After all, there was a reason for her to manage an Empire successfully for such a long time, and it wasn’t her beauty. </p><p>Not that her beauty was nothing but spectacular.  </p><p>I had been planning to give her some time to recover before moving to the next step, maybe even allowing her to rest for a while, but her reaction told me that she had other ideas. </p><p>Well, who was I to disappoint such a beautiful Queen? </p><p>“Hmm,” I murmured playfully, amused to get such an opening. “If you want a repeat, why don’t you put up a show of your conviction.” </p><p>“I would,” she murmured as she tried to move, her breasts jiggling as well as the chains. “But I can’t exactly move, can I?” </p><p>“You’re right,” I said as I waved my hand, loosening her chains enough to allow her to move around. </p><p>She looked at her wrists, still wrapped in chains. “That’s it?” she asked. </p><p>“Oh, yes,” I whispered. “After all, for a dancer as famous as you, a couple of chains shouldn’t be too much of a problem, right?” </p><p>The flash of frustration she displayed was beautiful, and the expression of determination that followed it was even more beautiful. “If you wish,” she said as she took two steps forward — which was almost all she could do with the movement range the loosened chains allowed. </p><p>“Such a majestic sight,” I murmured, smiling widely, enjoying the irony. </p><p>It earned a frustrated glare, but that didn’t prevent her from taking a step back before her body started swaying softly, a tantalizing show that required only seconds to remind her why she was able to moonlight as the most famous dancer of the Empire. </p><p>The plan was to stay back and watch her dance, but after watching her twirl and dance for barely a minute, my body decided to rebel, forcing me to take a step forward. A primordial feeling of satisfaction swept through me as my hand landed on her ass, enjoying her soft skin. </p><p>“You weren’t supposed to touch the dancer,” she whispered softly, her voice alluring. </p><p>“Interesting,” I murmured before I slapped her bottom, enjoying the way her skin wobbled under my touch. “Why don’t you call the guards to drag me away, then,” I said, leaning forward to steal a daring kiss. </p><p>As our tongues battled, my hand continued to dance over her body, caressing her inner thighs for a moment before arriving at her hot core, earning a muffled moan as I slipped inside her softness. </p><p>“I … I can handle myself,” she murmured after I pulled back, her breathing quick, which was hardly helped by the fact that my finger was still in her, pumping slowly to trigger the residual pleasure from her last climax. </p><p>“Oh, really,” I said, unable to help a chuckle escaping. “Maybe I should trust your experience?” Yet, as I said that, my fingers continued their relentless dance, enjoying the way she tightened around them. I was simply unable to contain myself. </p><p>“Maybe you should pull a chair, then,” she whispered as she gestured to the sole chair in the room. </p><p>“Oh, am I allowed to sit on it,” I said, amused by the sudden blush on her face that had little to do with the pleasure of my fingers, no doubt remembering the gleeful way she had informed me that I wasn’t allowed to use the chair when I was first captured. Normally, I would have pushed her more about that, as I was hardly the most forgiving when it came to such disrespect, but Sapphire went a long way to earn that beautiful forgiveness. I just chuckled as I cast a simple spell, dragging the chair close. </p><p>And I sat down in front of her. </p><p>Sapphire said nothing, just continuing to sway in front of me, seduction oozing from her. She turned a bit, giving me a glimpse of her from the profile before she closed in the distance, her breasts pressing against my chest beautifully. </p><p>I put my hands on her thighs, gliding on her legs up and down around her hips, until she slapped them away. “No touching,” she warned. </p><p>I followed her request, amused by her initiative. She continued to dance, lowering herself down slowly and seductively. Of course, her body finally connected to my lap, her wetness sliding back and forth while my shaft trapped by her ass, gave me a fresh flow of pleasure. </p><p>A pleasure that only got more intense as her hips pressed tighter against my crotch. </p><p>\"You naughty Queen,\" I whispered she continued to dance, her body tight against mine, no doubt about her deep arousal. She said nothing, busying herself to follow the rhythm of an imaginary melody, each second making the moment more delicious. </p><p>My shaft started throbbing in anticipation, and in response, she just continued to grind her hips into me, doing her best to disappear into my lap. At this moment, her sensual yet distant dance was abandoned in favor of a show that would have been only found in a much seedier scene… </p><p>I suppressed the temptation to grab her beautiful hips as she started thrusting her hips and moving her body faster, her breasts swaying whenever she leaned back a bit to free them from the support my chest provided. She said nothing else as the minutes passed slowly, nor that she needed to with the way her body was reacting, telling a story of arousal. </p><p>Her nipples, poking aggressively against my chest, was the punctuation of that little story. </p><p>I couldn’t help but gasp in disappointment as she decided to stand up, even when she grabbed my head to bury my face between her beautiful tits, giving me a trip to that beautiful valley. She ran her hands through my hair as she stood up, the chains jiggling once more. </p><p>Then, she turned her back, straining the chains as she gave me a beautiful view of her plump ass. Yet, this time, she didn’t waste her time in a slow, teasing descent, but moved down aggressively. </p><p>Then, I felt her wetness envelop me once more. It was a beautiful feeling, much superior to her velvety back pressing against my chest, my raging erection enveloped in her core. Her chains jiggled, making the moment even more beautiful, her hips rocking as fast as her heartbeat. With her arms crossed under her breasts as the chains were forced, it looked even more </p><p>I brought my hands along her torso, cupping her breasts against her orders. “I thought I said — no touching,” she murmured, unable to contain her gasp as her hips devoured my presence aggressively, creating a very beautiful sight in the process. </p><p>“Well, you did,” I said. “But did you really think that your words would be enough to keep me away from your glorious beasts forever,” I whispered into her ear, enjoying her shiver? I clenched my jaw to contain a moan when she reacted by quickening her hips even further. “Maybe you should have a better view of what was going on,” I whispered as I conjured a magical mirror in front of us. Her eyes widened as she caught her sight in the mirror, her mouth half-open in shock as she took the amazing beauty she was displaying. “It’s beautiful, right? Definitely worthy end for a Queen who is about to lose her throne after dying in a tragic accident.” </p><p>“It is —“ she started, only for her eyes to widen as she realized the implications of my words. “W-what?” To her credit, despite the ominous meaning of my words, her hips didn’t stop their movement, signaling she understood what I had been implying. Her lips stayed closed for a moment, her hips rocking faster and faster as a thinking expression invaded her face. </p><p>I examined her reflection in the mirror as she continued to consider my words, taking them with a calmness that surprised me, especially considering she was a Queen under the total mercy of the Dark Lord she had captured… </p><p>I continued squeezing her breasts even as she considered my words — her hips ever-moving — until she caught my gaze from the mirror. </p><p>“Explain,” she ordered, her voice still carrying the haze of pleasure despite the sharpness she tried to inject…</p>",
