    "content": "<p>It was already dusk before I could start experimenting again, but I couldn’t say that the day was wasted. One reason was that I had forged myself a set of anti-corrosive armor out of dense mana, a chainmail made of anti-flame metal I could put over my armor; and two sets of weapons, one anti-flame, and one anti-corrosive. </p><p>I had considered limiting myself to only one set of anti-flame equipment, but I decided against it after testing the performance of the two pieces of equipment. The dungeon crystals allowed me to forge a much better alloy, which translated into infusing more mana into my attacks. </p><p>Considering the possibility of facing human enemies, it felt like a reasonable time investment even if it prevented me from experimenting. </p><p>Luckily, my new weapons allowed me to upgrade my skills quickly. I just needed to hunt a dozen bosses before I was looking at a very welcome screen. </p><p>[Hammer of Avalanche (Epic) - 300 [Shattering Strike]</p><p>Blade of Bulwark (Epic) - 300 [Adamant Stance]</p><p>Spear of Storm (Epic) -300 [Mercurial Movement]</p><p>As much as it bothered me to not understand the mechanic behind why automating the process — be it with mana or with machines — weakened the presence of the sword, that did nothing to steal from the enjoyment of discovering another trick to improve my skills, this time completing their Epic nature. </p><p>Selecting the perks had been simple. A devastating new strike for the hammer, a defense-focused perk for the sword, and another movement perk for the spear, a familiar setup. All that remained was to test them. </p><p>But, before I did that, I used the dungeon connection to check the area around the gate, only to be met with a sight that changed my mind. </p><p>The defenders had been split into two groups, looking like they were about to come to blows. On one side, almost all of the fighting classes lined up, their weapons drawn, and several carts piled up with supplies behind them. </p><p>At the other side, stood Harold, supported by a team of Farmers brandishing their weapons. </p><p>“I wonder whether to call that good timing or bad timing,” I muttered. I was annoyed that it interrupted me before I  could properly test my new Perks. But then, I was also glad. Having the skills at the limit meant that I was ready to deal with any application of force if they wished so. </p><p>I opened a gate to the first floor, and stepped outside, wanting to join before the situation escalated. </p><p>“You can’t expect us to stand and fight just to save a bunch of worthless farmers,” one of the guards shouted. “We’re leaving.” </p><p>“Over my dead body —” Harold replied, his blade drawn. </p><p>“What’s going on?” I asked immediately as I arrived. </p><p>“Nothing important, sir. We’re having a slight disagreement, but as soon as I explain to them the folly of their actions —” </p><p>“Enough. Stop treating that upstart Blacksmith like a noble. He’s nothing more than a servant who got a few rare skill stones by getting into the good graces of a noble. I’ll die before I listen to him! And, you’re a fool if you think I’ll risk my life in a beast wave for him!” the guard declared, somehow looking confident despite the situation. </p><p>I could see the source of his confidence. About ninety percent of all guards stood behind him, clearly supporting his decision. As for the emotional empathy granted by Wisdom, it only made the situation worse. Their disdain toward me was intense, far more than I had expected. </p><p>More importantly, I could feel that their determination was solid. Far more solid than I expected. Why, I didn’t know —</p><p>A flash of epiphany interrupted me as I realized the possible source of it. They leveled up. </p><p>The guard force was cobbled together by Maria and Eleanor, and as a result, they were low-leveled; yet the special nature of the dungeon meant that they didn’t use it to level up rapidly. But, things were different at the dungeon entrance, where each guard killed likely thousands of lizard monsters, allowing them to level up aggressively. </p><p>At this point, I had long realized that the classes were somehow indoctrinating us to a certain set of behaviors, but I hadn’t considered what the impact of leveling would be. And, if the situation in front of me was any indicator, leveling up enhanced the indoctrination effect. </p><p>I would have been happy with that discovery if it hadn’t arrived in the form of a rebellion. </p><p>Admittedly, I wasn’t sure how much of it I could blame on the System. While it clearly played a role, there was more than enough ordinary discrimination going on. Moreover, I had been doing my best to improve the fighting capabilities of the Farmers despite their class, which wouldn’t help. </p><p>That was the dangerous thing about prejudices and discrimination. Any evidence to the contrary, rather than damaging their warped beliefs, actually made them stronger. </p><p>Cognitive dissonance was a dangerous phenomenon. </p><p>“You want to leave?” I asked, feeling a strange sense of resignation at my failure.  </p><p>“Of course, you worthless manwhore,” he declared, his anger and disdain bubbling to the surface, once again repeating his comments. </p><p>I didn’t bother to defend myself against his absurd statement, knowing that it would be useless. I paused for a moment, considering the implications. “Even with the risk the wilderness possesses,” I said. Though, as I said that, I knew that it was about the news of the beast wave. </p><p>Even without talking with Harold, I could guess that the beast wave had something to do with some kind of a boss monster. And, if my experience with the gargantuan insects was any indicator, I knew they could control the beasts that were around them. The beast wave probably cut the arrival of the new lizards from the dungeon. It would give them an opportunity to escape. </p><p>One that they probably considered as their only chance. </p><p>He just spat on the ground. “Are you going to let us go, or are we going to fight?” Behind him, the other guards nodded, looking excited at the prospect. </p><p>It looked like their recent leveling filled them with unfounded confidence. </p><p>It was not an easy decision. Ethics was one challenge. A part of me wanted to dissuade them from risking their lives pointlessly despite the intensity of the situation, but I didn’t have an option. I had clearly underestimated just how much they would hate the idea of being commanded by a Blacksmith.  </p><p>Maybe keeping them forcibly was the correct decision, but I wasn’t able to bring myself to it. </p><p>Another part of it was the secrets. They knew not only my true class, but the existence of the factory underneath, and my ability to mass-produce mana weapons. Letting them go would mean the dissemination of that information on a large scale. </p><p>However, the moment I revealed that secret to the thousands of people that currently occupied my dungeon, it had stopped being a secret. While I would have preferred to keep that under wraps for a while more, it would inevitably leak. </p><p>Similarly, I could find dozens of reasons to keep them in, but none of them were strong enough to keep a potentially violent group of dissidents as a part of our group. And, there were perks to it as well. At this point, I was confident in our ability to defend the dungeon against the forces the city lords might presumably send, and making some kind of trade deal might be possible. </p><p>Especially if I was willing to sell Forge and Meditation skill stones cheaply, something I was more than happy to do. </p><p>“Fine, you can leave,” I said, coming to a quick decision. Next to me, I could see Harold look at me in shock, but he managed to keep himself from interjecting. I appreciated it. </p><p>“Good. We just need a bunch of farmers to keep us fed during the journey, and we’ll be out of your hair … sir,” he said, the last word delivered with all the smug satisfaction of a schoolyard bully. </p><p>“And, you have volunteers?” I asked. </p><p>He smirked. “Give me a minute, and I’ll find hundreds of volunteers —” he started. </p><p>I didn’t need the emotional reading from Wisdom to guess he was planning to forcibly drag them away. I could have argued for a long time. Instead, I raised my foot, and slammed on the metal floor as I tried to deliver an inferior copy of my hammer skill. It was a trick I had discovered some time ago, though it was more of a parlor trick than anything. Without a weapon to properly engage the skill, the effect was a pale imitation at best. </p><p>[-100 Mana]</p><p>The whole defensive encampment shook as the tremble spread through the metal, making them take a step back. </p><p>They looked shocked, but I didn’t blame them. I was equally surprised. The attack came out far stronger than I had expected, and somehow, I knew Wisdom was responsible. It looked like I had discovered my first clue on how to actively leverage it. </p><p>Too bad I couldn’t focus on that for the moment. </p><p>“Try that, and I might decide to change my mind,” I threatened.  </p><p>“You think —” he started, but I interrupted him again, this time with a flash of my blade that turned into a real ranged attack, destroying one of the carts they had prepared. </p><p>[-200 Mana]</p><p>However, the choice was not random. The floor was metal, and the carts had enough metal content as well. Together, it was enough for me to identify which cart was filled with skill stones, and I destroyed it. </p><p>“How dare —” he started, but I slashed three more times, each passing near the carts that were filled with their supplies. I didn’t destroy them, but the display was memorable enough. </p><p>“I promised Maria to let you bunch leave without intervention. Don’t make me reconsider it,” I said as I raised my blade to tap to his throat. </p><p>He let out a threatening growl. “You’ll regret this,” he challenged, but considering he was already retreating, I decided to let him do so. </p><p>I watched as they pulled their carts down the mountain, glaring at them to make sure they didn’t pick the discarded skill stones. Only after they were down the mountain, I turned to Harold. </p><p>It looked like we needed to have a talk.  </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Incredible work. I’m proud of all of you,” I called as I stood in front of the dungeon gate, making sure my armor caught the light of the dawn perfectly, knowing that it would impress them, particularly after a night of fighting where I had killed more than three hundred thousand monsters single-handedly. </p><p>An absurd number that was only possible thanks to the wide area mana attacks. </p><p>I could feel even the guards looking at me with renewed reverence, showing that my extended display somehow managed to push through their supernatural discrimination. </p><p>“I wonder how long it will stick this time,” I muttered after I stepped to the fourth floor. It wasn’t the first time I had impressed them with my battle prowess. It faded relatively quickly in previous times, making me wonder how long it would last this time. </p><p>But, I shrugged. Among everything I had been trying to achieve, impressing them wasn’t even on the list. </p><p>Speaking of benefits…</p><p>[Smith of Decay - Level 53]</p><p>[Health 3180/3180] [Mana 2650/2650]</p><p>[Vitality 265 / Strength 212 / Dexterity 159 / Essence 265 / Wisdom 159]</p><p>[Skills (9/15)</p><p>Meditation of Decay (Mythic) - 100 [Controlled Flow, Superior Sensing, Purification]</p><p>Mana Repair (Epic) - 103 [Advanced Observe]</p><p>Mana Forge (Epic) - 313 [Advanced Creative Forging, Advanced Mana Control]</p><p>Nurture (Legendary) - 53</p><p>Hammer of Avalanche (Epic) - 123 </p><p>Blade of Bulwark (Epic) - 172</p><p>Spear of Storm (Epic) -133</p><p>Fire Bolt (Basic) - 25 </p><p>Shoot (Basic) - 25]</p><p>I called the status screen, taking note of the changes. I had gained three levels, which was unfortunately less than I had expected. Comparatively, I had killed even more than the previous expedition that gave me seven levels, but, I had only gained three this time. </p><p>I sighed. I had anticipated a drop, but not that much. With the exponential nature of the drop, it meant that pushing above level sixty would be next to impossible … well, until the lizards got even stronger, but that would come with its own problems. </p><p>Comparatively, the improvement of my skills was more in line with my expectations. This time, I relied mostly on my sword, as its slashing attacks were still the best method to deal with larger groups without destroying their claws. </p><p>Crushing and absorbing them went a long way to refill the reserves of the dungeon, enough that helping several hundred Farmers improve their classes didn’t even register as an expense. My Mythic meditation was paying incredible dividends. </p><p>But, none of them was as valuable as the observations I had made as I watched the others, one that led me to think of something I hadn’t considered before. </p><p>The quality of the weapon impacted the conceptual weight of the attacks. </p><p>Even now, it felt like an absurd idea, the craftsmanship of the weapon somehow affecting the power of the attack. But, after watching more than a thousand people fight all night, each using weapons made by different people, the observation was clear. </p><p>Naturally, it wasn’t a conclusion. Unlike performance, quality was not something that could be defined easily. Maybe, quality was not even the correct word to explain what had been going on there. But, the accuracy of the word didn’t matter. </p><p>What mattered was to have a direction for my experiments. </p><p>I started to work with a simple, cast-iron blade, one that would shatter with a bad blow. Then, I forged a second, properly forged dagger. Third, I folded the iron almost a hundred times, turning it into a proper impressive weapon. </p><p>The following ranged attacks confirmed that the better dagger actually had a stronger presence. Significantly so. It was not a proper, statistically significant sample, but it was promising. </p><p>I forged five sets of each, just to confirm that it worked … only, it didn’t. “Really,” I muttered in frustration as I tested the new set of daggers, only for them to lack the presence completely. </p><p>I closed my eyes and examined the daggers, using Observe to examine their structure. The edge of the blade was the same, the crystalline structure had the same general properties, even the way the hilt and the blade connected was the same. So, what was the difference—</p><p>“It can’t be that, right?” I paused, realizing that there was one big factor I hadn’t considered before. For the first set of blades, I didn’t use mana to take any shortcuts until the quenching process. The second set, I did. “It has to be wrong,” I muttered. </p><p>It has to be. After all, why should the method of creation have any impact on the weapon, as long as the resulting product was the same? It was silly, and illogical, like believing in horoscopes. “It’s absurd,” I muttered in frustration.  </p><p>However, no matter how absurd the idea was, I still tried it. I had forged multiple daggers, as identical as possible. But, for one group, I mined a fresh set of ore, doing everything by hand. The other, I used mana for each step. </p><p>The daggers in the first group had stronger presences without exception. And, it wasn’t a slight difference either. Instead, the difference could be determined to be significant. </p><p>I frowned, wondering whether it was the mana that was responsible for it. Maybe the involvement of mana was somehow ruining the conceptual integrity of the dagger, it's touch enough to change it so drastically. Maybe it was Wisdom’s function, to keep the conceptual existence strong despite the additional mixture.  </p><p>Testing it was easy. I forged another two groups of daggers, this time from the mana alloy, but otherwise doing my best to keep their quality equal to the first set. </p><p>The results of that test were enough to invalidate my earlier thoughts. The conceptual weight of the first set was strong enough to rival the other handmade sets. There were some minute differences, but not enough to make it significant. </p><p>“It doesn’t make sense,” I growled, trying to understand what was going on. I could feel that I was close, but I failed to pinpoint it. I had a feeling that  I was missing something obvious … but what. </p><p>But, instead of trying to brute force it, I decided to go for a walk to the third floor. Maybe watching the other blacksmiths operate would help. </p><p>I could have opened a gate with a thought, but instead, I decided to run the distance, which was a good way to stretch my legs while also examining my new movement style that came with Spear of Storm, testing its capabilities when it came to sharp turns, acceleration, and other technical tricks. </p><p>There was no harm in being prepared. </p><p>However, as I covered the distance, I noticed something interesting. I had come across the occasional giant insect, which shouldn’t be appearing on the third floor. “Probably a consequence of all that extra mana,” I decided. Luckily, the residents had long passed the point of being threatened by them. Still, I made a note to alert Harold. </p><p>Once I arrived at the third floor, I didn’t approach the production line, but instead picked an empty hill that I could observe them from. </p><p>It was harder to feel the presence of the weapons from a distance, but it didn’t matter. I was here to brainstorm rather than to collect data. I watched the large group of workers, their numbers already above three hundred, working intensely.</p><p>My Wisdom-enhanced memory helped me to recognize quite a bit of them had been outside, fighting to level up. Not that I blamed them. Leveling up gave them Strength, which in turn allowed them to absorb Common Forge. </p><p>Looking at what they had achieved, I had no intention of complaining. Half a dozen railroads spread from the center, steam engines pulling wagons filled with ore to the large blast furnaces to be melted, some used by the blacksmiths to forge corrosion-resistant alloys which then turned into various weapons and machines, while some had been stored, waiting for my attention to be turned into the flame resistant variants. </p><p>However, after spending a minute watching them, I slapped my head. “Of course,” I growled as I returned, forging another set of daggers. This time, I didn’t use mana, but automated the process through machines as much as possible. </p><p>The result was … there was no difference — at least, not one I could currently measure — between using mana and using machines to shortcut certain steps, both damaging the presence of the weapon significantly. </p><p>I paused, wondering whether I discovered something truly groundbreaking, or if I had made the world’s most obvious discovery. “Either way, I have a practical benefit,” I said while I started forging a new sword out of dense mana.</p><p>One, that was shaped perfectly to serve my Blade of Bulwark, which took more than two hours to forge even with the infinite mana that was provided by the dungeon. But, as I quenched it in water, water bubbling, I had a good feeling about it. </p><p>“Let’s put you to the test,” I muttered as I waved my sword, and a deadly arc of mana cut through the air, disappearing into the distance. </p><p>[-900 Mana]</p><p>[Blade of Bulwark (Epic) 173 -&gt; 175]</p><p>“Perfect,” I muttered. I might not have made any real progress scientifically about what the concept was, but a devastating new attack was an excellent in-progress result … especially when it came with a way to hasten my skill growth once again. </p><p>I didn’t return to experimentation immediately, instead forging myself a new set of equipment. It meant I would spend half a day where I could experiment, but considering I might get attacked anytime, it felt like a reasonable precaution. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Sir,” one of the guards spoke as I walked out without Harold. “Will you be leading us tonight?” </p><p>To his credit, he tried to hide his distaste, but even without the new emotional sensitivity granted by my Wisdom, he had no chance to succeed. “No, Harold will return in a few hours. Meanwhile, maintain your usual command. I’ll be exploring the mountain for a while,” I replied and walked forward. </p><p>The more I interacted with the guards, the more I was bothered by the mental manipulation. Maybe I should put my Wisdom to better use by examining their emotional responses in a way that couldn’t just be captured by a survey. </p><p>However, even without it, I had suspicions that classes were the source, with my earlier surveys from the Farmers not only confirming the idea but also leading me to believe that there was some kind of hidden variable that was in play also affecting natural skill upgrades. </p><p>The surveys had already confirmed that the farmers who lacked that hidden variable — or possessed in excess — were also lacking in courage and initiative. </p><p>Too bad I couldn’t apply the methodology with the guards, not without empowering a bunch of guards to the point they treated rebellion as an achievable option. </p><p>The guards said nothing as I left them behind as I moved down the mountain, easily stabbing the lizards that started to climb the mountains. My climb down wasn’t just a blind courage, I wanted to test three critical abilities at once. </p><p>The most important one, I wanted to test if opening a second dungeon gate between Earth and the dungeon was possible. While the connection between me and the dungeon came with some instinctual information, it was not even as good as what the skills were providing. Often, only when attempting something was I able to figure out if it was possible or not. </p><p>However, while it was the most important objective, I didn’t immediately try it. If possible I would have liked to keep it hidden from the guards, which meant I needed to be away from the mountain peak, preferably with something to block the view. </p><p>This brought me to my second objective, figuring out how far I could get away from the dungeon before the connection between me and the dungeon prevented me from moving further away. It was a critical piece of information that would change my strategy going forward. </p><p>Additionally, I wanted to kill more lizards, which had multiple benefits. Leveling up was one. I also wanted to test my combat skills against a more challenging opponent and gather even more shells, but those benefits didn’t make the third one as important as the first two objectives. However, the number of lizards that started to climb the mountains desperately told me that it was the case. </p><p>My spear danced as I moved down the mountain with great speed, each lizard lasting only one hit. The weak variants didn’t help me improve my skill even by one point, but that was to be expected. </p><p>About a mile later, I paused, examining my connection, which pointed toward the dungeon gate. The more I got away, the more uncomfortable the connection was getting. Not painful, but merely discomforting like trying to hold a box for a few minutes too long.</p><p>It was hard to mathematically calculate something as vague as discomfort, but even my most optimistic estimates were below a ten-mile radius.</p><p>The dungeon connection was both a lifeline and a chain. </p><p>After a few attempts, I stopped trying to absorb the energy from the claws, as the strained connection meant the process was considerably slower. I could still break down the fire-natured tainted energy easily, but just like how the speed of mana recovery had slowed down as I got away, the reverse was also true. </p><p>Making the process too slow to be replicated, meaning straying away from the dungeon to kill the lizards wasn’t an effective way to reinforce the place. </p><p>“One last item to be tested,” I muttered as I moved farther away until I found a nice cave for myself. Once I threw a rock at the entrance and blocked it, I flooded the cave with mana, more as a precaution than anything else. </p><p>From there, I used the old digging trick to move about half a mile beneath the ground, creating an artificial cave away. It was most likely unnecessary, but, better safe than sorry. </p><p>Only then, did I reach into the connection, opened a new gate, and a blue glow appeared in front of me. “Nice,” I said as I was hit by exhaustion. It wasn’t as intense as what I felt when I had shifted the other end of the gate from the first to the fifth floor, but it was significantly more than opening gates between different dungeon floors. </p><p>I was happy despite the exhaustion, because the moment I had done it, I could feel that my connection had been snapped back to full power. I used another flare of mana, and my mana replenished immediately rather than the slight delay I had experienced earlier. </p><p>“Let’s see if it works both ways.” I crushed some claws I had with me, absorbing them with ease. The mana went into the dungeon without the slightest delay, which was good. The way the fire-natured tainted energy moved, was less good. </p><p>Next to the dungeon gate, any tiny scraps would have been blown away by the gate’s repelling effect.  My new gate also had a repelling force, but it was much weaker. The new gate wasn’t as strong as the main dungeon entrance. It was flimsier, but how much was about my subconscious impression that it would be temporary, and how much of it was the nature of the additional gates, I didn’t know.  </p><p>“One last experiment,” I added while I focused on the gate, giving it the mental order to close. I was able to do it, but closing the gate was more exhausting than opening it in the first place. </p><p>Moreover, I could feel that even after I had closed the gate, I could feel its presence. It wasn’t that the gate was on standby, but there was, for lack of a better word, a mark. The sensation was curious enough to change my plans about adding another experiment. </p><p>I touched my connection, and the gate appeared in place again, this time considerably easier. However, closing it was still just as exhausting. </p><p>“I wonder if I could reopen it from inside the dungeon,” I said as I climbed through the same tunnel I had disappeared from. I didn’t know if it would be possible, but if it was, it could be a significant strategic advantage. </p><p>“I guess we will see,” I growled as I arrived at the original cave, carefully covering the tunnel behind me once more. I even used Nurture to regrow the wild plants around the tunnel to hide the spot I dug in the first place. </p><p>Once out, I moved down the mountain some more, which was more in an attempt to confuse any potential spies than any practical need. The trip had already served most of its purpose. </p><p>However, instead of climbing back, I continued to descend down, killing more lizards. All but one regarding my ultimate limit of travel from the gate,  which I was reluctant to push my luck about by increasing the distance too much. In the end, I traveled three miles away, and even then, it was because of my newly discovered ability to open more gates in case of an emergency. </p><p>Whether that emergency came in the form of a sudden snap in the power of the connection, or an assassination attempt from the mysterious organization that was backing Thomas. </p><p>I returned to the gate once that last point was determined. Since the distance prevented me from absorbing the claws properly, there was no point in expanding my reach for the moment. Instead, I returned to the dungeon gate. When I returned, Harold was already back outside, leading the defenses. </p><p>“I hope it was a fruitful trip, sir,” he said.  </p><p>“It was,” I replied. “I have seen enough to understand the danger around us. Do you think our new recruits could handle some more action?” I kept my tone jovial, but Harold knew me enough that it was not a frivolous request. </p><p>“I’m sure they would appreciate a proper challenge, sir,” he replied. “And, it’ll be a good opportunity to test our new siege weapons.” </p><p>“Good,” I said even as I flipped my hammer in hand, curious how far I would be able to push my new skills in one night of endless combat. It annoyed me that staying outside to fight was the best way to spend my time despite having multiple critical tasks to accomplish, including something as monumental as understanding how Wisdom worked, but there was no helping it. </p><p>The advantages of staying outside were too vital. For one, my presence and mana attacks would allow us to draw far more lizards toward the defenses and deal with them directly. Their claws were critical to reinforce the dungeon further while also helping me to level up. </p><p>Killing tens of thousands of them — maybe even more — directly would improve my skills somewhat, but that side benefit at best. Improved skills would be beneficial, but if my past experience was any indicator, learning how to use Wisdom would be a much better path to improve them. </p><p>Also, there was another benefit. Fighting all night would allow me to observe thousands of people fight all night, each attack carrying a varying amount of ‘conceptual weight’. While observation was not the best way to figure out such things, it would give me a good basis, which was all I needed. </p><p>The sum of those reasons equaled another sleepless night for me. </p><p>But, I had one more thing to do. Before the battle started, I went back into the dungeon, and focused on the gate I had opened earlier. I could feel the presence of it, even though it was somewhat faded. It felt like I could reopen it like I had suspected. </p><p>But, instead of testing it, I returned. I had experimented enough for the moment. Now, it was time to level up. </p>",

Instead, I moved to the fourth floor, where my condenser lay, to improve my last remaining skill. </p><p>Legendary Nurture. </p><p>There were two reasons for this. For once, it would be my first Legendary skill. While my Meditation was leveled even higher, considering the way it changed, it had no real value as a benchmark. I didn’t even understand what it was doing, let alone compare it with the other stages of Meditation to get a better sense of changes between levels. Improving Legendary Nurture would give me a better idea. </p><p>Also, I couldn’t just assume that Nurture wouldn’t be useful. It might not have an immediate combat impact, but that didn’t make it useless. During the assault on the flame dungeon, things would have been far more difficult if it wasn’t for the flammable trees I had grown in a hurry, allowing me to trick the army that Maria was there. </p><p>Chances were that something like that wouldn’t happen, but considering I still had somewhere just under an hour before nightfall, it was a good way to spend my time. </p><p>“Let’s start with the classics,” I said and moved to the condenser, which had several different concentrations of poison water from the fifth floor, collecting for eventual usage. But, I didn’t start with it. Instead, I broke a branch from the nearest tree, moved deeper into the fourth-floor swamp, and put my new skill to use. </p><p>[-150 Health]</p><p>[Nurture (Legendary) 1 -&gt; 4]</p><p>“That’s not as much growth as I had hoped,” I said while I examined the fully-grown tree. But, it didn’t surprise me. Just like how the Epic variant had been more efficient than the Rare one when it came to neutralizing the poison, the same was true for the Legendary one. </p><p>I grew a few more trees — which didn’t even raise it to ten —  before I returned to the condenser and started replicating the same with higher poison concentrates. It worked, for a while. When I was at the fifth level of concentration, Nurture had reached forty, giving me the hope that it could work. </p><p>Unfortunately, the other five levels of concentration barely improved it further.   </p><p>[Nurture (Legendary) - 51]</p><p>“It looks like I have exhausted the potential of yet another method,” I muttered. I examined the condenser, wondering if it was worth trying to improve it further. After all, its design was primitive at best. Building a better centrifuge, or a way to hasten the condensation further might help it further. </p><p>But, once again, it would mean dedicating some of my precious time. For all intents and purposes, the Legendary skill should be enough for my goals. </p><p>Instead of trying to examine it further, I focused on noting down my discoveries, the biggest one being the dense Vitality. </p><p>Legendary skills still used the same dense variant. </p><p>The lack of a superior variant was a mixed bag. On the positive side, it meant that the formulas Maria worked so hard to derive were still useful. However, it also meant that raising my Forge skill to legendary wouldn’t be the transformation I had been hoping for to further put the game to my benefit. </p><p>“Well, not all hands can be winners,” I muttered while examining the new forest I had created during the experiment, and focused on one topic I had been neglecting: How the dungeon was reacting to the plants. That and whether it was truly helping or not. </p><p>I tried to understand that before, but back then, I didn’t have the Wisdom to translate the nature of the conceptual transformation. With it, I could watch the minute details of the energy breakdown better. After examining some, the answer was clear.  </p><p>The trees slowed down the conversion process of the dungeon. Significantly. </p><p>The mechanic of that slowing down was simple. Where the dungeon mist touched the ground — or water, when the situation was like the fifth floor — it created a surface for whatever magical reaction was happening to propagate more mist, which was a very critical part of the dungeon operation. The trees pushed the dungeon mist back, which meant they slowed down the generation of new dungeon mist. </p><p>I took a note to warn Harold about not letting farmers expand the tree coverage too much. Ten percent of each dungeon surface seemed like a good rule of thumb. </p><p>Then, I turned toward the strategic implications. Having the ability to impair the dungeon’s operation could be a decisive advantage in containing the dungeon breaks. Admittedly, I would have been more excited before learning at least some of the dungeon breaks were artificially induced, but it certainly couldn’t be the case for every dungeon. </p><p>And, even if they were, this could give us an easy way to get them back under control. Including ones like the Flame Dungeon. </p><p>“If we could survive long enough,” I added with a sigh. </p><p>The idea of sending an expedition was tempting, but two major problems stood in our way: One was my bond with the dungeon. While I was yet to truly test its limits, I doubted it would allow me to go that far away. </p><p>And, even if it did, the path was no longer safe. Instead, it was filled with lizards, which would no doubt get much worse the closer we got to the location of the dungeon. Going back would be a multi-day journey, one that held no hope of hiding, making us sitting ducks against any assassination attempt. </p><p>We won’t be dealing with the source anytime soon. </p><p>With that done, I finally went back to the first floor of the dungeon. The nightfall was minutes away, and I wanted to be there when it started. The ability to level up further was tempting. </p><p>“Sir,” Harold greeted me once I arrived outside. </p><p>“Give me a report of the defenses,” I said, and Harold started giving the report. Admittedly, I didn’t need a long report. Every part of the new encampment was covered with metal to benefit from their flame-resistant properties, which meant I could use my Observe perk to get an accurate glimpse of anything that was in a ten-yard radius around me. </p><p>It was certainly beneficial. </p><p>“And, there’s the new highlight of our defenses. The ballistas,” he said proudly as he stood next to one of the newly erected towers. </p><p>“They finished it?” I asked, pleasantly surprised. Earlier that day, they still had several major technical hurdles. My estimation was that they wouldn’t have been able to resolve it in a day, but I just asked them to challenge themselves.</p><p>It was one topic I was happy to be wrong about. </p><p>“How about the claw stocks?” I said. </p><p>“We have collected about thirty thousand during the day,” Harold said. </p><p>“That’s more than we expected,” I said, frowning slightly. “Did you send teams to hunt?” </p><p>“No, sir. Not yet,” he said. “However, the number of lizards is increasing more than we expected.” </p><p>“Meaning, either the dungeon is letting out even more than we realized, or…” </p><p>“They are somehow leading more of them toward our dungeon,” Harold completed my thought, his expression confirming that it was the likelier option. “And, if that’s the case, they might have a team ready to attack.” </p><p>“True,” I said, wondering what would happen if just one high-level mage got near us while we were fighting against the lizards. The answer was not good. “We need to upgrade our defenses significantly.” </p><p>He paused. “There’s not a lot we can do as long as we have to defend the dungeon from outside,” he started. </p><p>“True. But, we have to —” I started, only to pause. We didn’t have to, not anymore. Previously, we had to, because any lizard that entered the dungeon meant a loss of mana and dungeon energy. But, now that I could transform their tainted energy directly thanks to Wisdom, it meant that I could compensate for the losses. </p><p>Especially if I could combine it with the ability of the trees to keep the dungeon mist away. That way, a zone where we could kill the lizards while still making a net gain was possible. The only disadvantage was that I needed to be there to absorb the resulting tainted energy in real time. </p><p>“Actually, we don’t have to,” I said to Harold. “I’ll handle the defense against the lizards tonight. I want you to build a strong defensive castle on the first floor, its immediate surroundings covered with trees.” </p><p>“Around the gate?” </p><p>“No, build it somewhere near the edge of the first floor,” I said. “I can always shift the gate there in case of an emergency.” I didn’t want to block the natural flow of the dungeon energy any more than necessary. </p><p>For the next twenty minutes, we discussed the technical details of the new defenses, which also gave me ideas on how to build a similar defensive scheme for the fifth floor as well. We only stopped when the sunlight outside disappeared completely. </p><p>Harold went to build the new defenses for the alternative first-floor entrance, while I walked through the gate, ready to truly test my skills outside. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“I’m spending too much time in swamps, wading through knee-deep water,” I said and took a shallow breath. While my connection with the dungeon had allowed me to push away its corrosive aura and keep myself safe, that did nothing to the ugly feeling of breathing swamp fumes. And it certainly didn’t smell like a rose garden. </p><p>Nor did it help the ugly sensation of my feet sinking into the mud, the texture enough to annoy me. The fifth-floor swamp was truly an ugly place. However, as I walked forward, I couldn’t help but compare it with the other swamps I had seen in those weird dreams. Those looked much better with their glowing plants and lively environment. </p><p>“Unfortunately, terraforming thousands of square miles of land is not my first priority,” I said. Not only was my newly acquired Legendary Nurture not the first skill I wanted to improve, but even if I did, I had a much better way of achieving it. </p><p>Instead, I twirled my hammer while doing my best to ignore the annoying sucking sensation under my boots, and searched for the next batch of insects. For once, on the fifth floor, I had to search for them rather than the opposite; which was a side effect of practicing an Epic sword skill for a while while expanding a lot of mana, not to mention my earlier experiment where I killed ten boss monsters back to back. </p><p>I probably destroyed tens of thousands of insects in less than four hours. One good thing came of the process: it gave me a lot of Epic Nurture that the farmers who couldn’t improve their skills naturally could use. </p><p>Despite the damaged insect population, the fifth floor was the perfect place to test my new skills. I had spent the past few hours familiarizing myself with Blade of Bulwark, which had already given me a better idea regarding how to improve an Epic combat skill to the first stage. </p><p>Luckily, even with the dungeon’s population significantly damaged, it didn’t take long for me to find a new swarm, which emerged from the fog — the ordinary kind — with their usual rage, their carapaces glistening in the dim light, their mandibles clicking threateningly. </p><p>I held back my desire to make bad hammer puns as I raised my Hammer high, pumping my mana to its head as I waited for them to get closer. Only when the one at the front was merely a yard away, I brought the hammer down. </p><p>[-120 Mana]</p><p>The quake attack was different from mana blades. It didn’t have the great, steady range of the blade attacks, nor did it have the gentle effectiveness of the spear attacks. It spread like a cone, barely spreading ten yards before it lost its power, meaning most of the horde was still alive. If it was a blade attack, all of the insects would have died.  </p><p>What it had was power. Pure, unbridled power. The attacking insects, regardless of their type, turned into small chunks as they spread around, making me glad for the self-cleaning feature of the dungeon.  </p><p>The reward was equally eye-catching. </p><p>[Hammer of Avalanche (Epic) 1 -&gt; 34]</p><p>“Perfect,” I muttered, swinging the hammer again, this time channeling Health to its direct capabilities rather than using the attacks that I had adopted from its Rare variants. </p><p>[-250 Health]</p><p>[Hammer of Avalanche (Epic) 34 -&gt; 45]</p><p>The results were even more spectacular. Unlike the previous attack, the shockwave spread in a more controlled manner. Not just a wild cone, but as a line, extending the area it affected significantly. But, its restrained nature didn’t limit its destructive power. For an outside observer, it would have looked like the middle portion of the horde had simply disappeared. </p><p>“Not bad,” I said happily, realizing that I had underestimated the change between the Rare and Epic skills because of the lackluster performance of Blade of Bulwark; but it was just misjudging the balance of offense and defense of the skill. </p><p>I realized that I could probably defeat Eleanor without her mana skill with relative ease. A great growth, too bad it came in a way, that guaranteed to make even bigger enemies.  </p><p>After testing the hammer skill, the rest was easy. Just move around the dungeon, occasionally spreading tainted energy to trigger their approach. Half an hour of commitment gave me enough improvement to bring it to a satisfactory point.  </p><p>[Hammer of Avalanche (Epic) - 92]</p><p>However, the constant improvement of the attack wasn’t the only benefit. Switching between two skills gave me another opportunity to understand the conceptual weight of the attacks. With my earlier experimentation failing to yield any practical results, observation — the ordinary kind, and not the perk kind — turned significantly more valuable. </p><p>“Let’s add some more samples,” I said as I switched to my spear, and pierced the nearest insect, the mana sticking around its tip rather than turning into a ranged attack. Naturally, it was not an ordinary coating, but one that cycled and rotated in a complicated pattern that I learned from Breeze Spear. </p><p>[Spear of Storms (Epic) 1 -&gt; 8]</p><p>The sudden burst of improvement wasn’t as impressive, but it was inevitable. The ranged attacks from the spear were not particularly impressive, its true value lying in its mobility value. “At least, flying is not a default part,” I muttered in relief even as I darted forward, using its natural mobility. </p><p>Even without any enhancement from Health or Mana, the agility it provided was enough to surpass my earlier Fleeting Step, but the method was quite similar. The more I interacted with the perks, the more I got convinced that they were merely a unique subset of abilities from the more advanced form of the skill. </p><p>Meaning, that all my efforts learning the applications of the perks could be deemed a waste, at least from the perspective of measuring only the outcome. However, it was just an absentminded mental flicker, as I always believed that methods taught people more than the outcomes. </p><p>My rapid development only confirmed this notion. </p><p>”Focus,” I admonished myself, taking down several insects at once as I swung my spear as an arc. Technically, not the ideal way of using a spear, but with its body glowing with mana, it didn’t matter. </p><p>[Spear of Storms (Epic) 8 -&gt; 21]</p><p>As I continued to enhance the skill, I realized that, unlike the previous two variants, the name Storm not only referred to the movement speed of the style, but also to the destructive potential it contained. Once I used the Vitality attack, the energy crackled around the spearhead threateningly. </p><p>It wasn’t truly electricity, but an approximation of it, almost a conceptual copy. I didn’t know just how strong the attack was — the insects didn’t make the best measure of endurance since they died by one stab either way — but I guessed it wasn’t low. </p><p>As for whether Hammer of Avalanche or Spear of Storms had the higher destructive power, it probably depended on the nature of the enemy. </p><p>However, it was just another item to the long list of questions that needed to be answered. </p><p>I continued to move through the swamp, dealing with the insects through various attacks, and soon, their numbers were in the low nineties as well. I paused, wondering about the relative merits of pushing the skill higher versus letting it stay at its current level and focusing on other tasks before nightfall. </p><p>It was a difficult choice, particularly since I expected it to show some fundamental improvements once they surpassed three hundred. Every other skill did so, sacrificing another hour for another twenty skill points, spread across the three skills was worthwhile. </p><p>Luckily, before I could make that decision, a distinct feeling warned me about the birth of another boss monster. “Right on time,” I muttered even as I started running toward the beast, which rushed toward me with an equal display of anger to erase me. </p><p>Soon, I was facing another gargantuan insect with its thick, armored shell. The perfect target for testing my new skills. </p><p>“First, the offense,” I said to myself and rushed forward, dancing around the beast as I applied several choice attacks, a mixture of Vitality, dense Vitality, and ordinary mana. I would have loved to use the dense mana equivalent of it as well, but that was temporarily outside my capabilities. </p><p>Maybe if I could forge an appropriate composite weapon…</p><p>I soon shifted to the hammer, repeating the same, focusing the immense destructive power to completely destroy its legs before I switched to the sword and shield combo. It was intentional, as, unlike the others, I wanted to test its defensive potential, and the best way to do that was when the boss monster was too injured to unleash a full-powered attack.  </p><p>With my shield flaring with dense Vitality, the beast smashed against me, only for its attack to be completely wasted. Blade of Bulwark took the first step into proving itself by taking an impaired charge from the boss monster. </p><p>Then, I switched to mana, replicating the effect, which worked well enough until the boss had recovered its full might. The next few attacks showed that my variant with mana could only take down attacks when it was weakened, while dense Vitality was able to tank even full-powered charges, ignoring the gap between our relative mass with ease. </p><p>Once that was confirmed, I started cycling between the different weapons, until I finished the battle with a devastating hit from Hammer of Avalanche. </p><p>“Not a bad visit,” I said. The fifth floor might be a disgustingly unpleasant location, but the benefits of a visit were hard to argue against. </p><p>[Hammer of Avalanche (Epic) - 125 </p><p>Blade of Bulwark (Epic) - 123</p><p>Spear of Storm (Epic) -122]</p><p>Now, it was time to put them to a more hostile test, one on the outside… </p>",

    "content": "<p>“I should have collected more skills,” I muttered even as I looked at the notifications from my chosen skill stones, which I hadn’t been able to read properly before my Class Upgrade. </p><p>[Skill Stone: Hammer of Avalanche (Epic)]</p><p>[Skill Stone: Spear of Storms (Epic)]</p><p>[Skill Stone: Blade of Bulwark (Epic)]</p><p>[Skill Stone: Nurture (Legendary)]</p><p>My first disappointment was that there was no Wisdom-based spellcasting. If there were any, with my stats, they would have turned apparent. </p><p>For Epic skills, the ones in front of me weren’t my only options. However, I decided on them since they were the upgraded versions of the two I had possessed, while the third one was the upgrade of the Uncommon skill I had. </p><p>Unfortunately, there was no upgraded version of the Relentless Blade, a valuable skill Eleanor had gifted me, but I was ready to make the change. While it had its unique advantages, of the three external skills I used, it was the one that I could sacrifice without feeling its loss. </p><p>Not to mention, while Relentless Blade worked excellently against monsters due to its aggressive style, it was not exactly the best against other people. Not to mention, assuming I figured out how to use Wisdom-based spells, having a defense-oriented style would fit me better.  </p><p>Together, the three of them had made a strong, comprehensive fighting style. A relentless, offensive hammer that was perfect against armored enemies and giant targets with low mobility, a spear that prioritized speed and precision to deal with dangerous enemies while maintaining a healthy distance, and a sword style that fit well to fight against other people while relying on the superior stopping power of my own armor. </p><p>While, technically, I could try to find a better combination, I didn’t have time to experiment with other styles to see if they worked any better, especially with the threat from the lizards growing every day, not to mention the existence of the mysterious enemy that would almost certainly attack again, possibly soon. </p><p>Also, I wasn’t sure I could use tricks like Fleeting Step that I had learned without the support from other skills. I was able to copy them with ease without the Perk, but the skill that it was based on was still there. </p><p>Compared to the others, losing access to Strike of Retribution was more acceptable, weakening the ranged blade attack somewhat. </p><p>A good exchange for better defense.  </p><p>“Let’s not waste time,” I said to myself as I grabbed Blade of Bulwark first. Absorbing the skills took some time, not to mention causing pain. I didn’t have time to waste, as I needed to not only absorb them before nightfall but also improve them to the point of disguising their nature. </p><p>[Relentless Blade (Rare) 200 -&gt; Blade of Bulwark (Epic) 1]</p><p>I was prepared for the pain, but to my surprise, there was no pain. It went far smoother than I had expected, making me wonder if it was the impact of the Wisdom or the connection with the dungeon. </p><p>However, it might be simply that the painful process of receiving my only Mythic skill had changed something irrevocably as well. </p><p>“Either way,” I said as I raised my blade, and started going through my well-established routine of forcing skill growth, with mana attacks.</p><p>[-40 Mana]  </p><p>[Blade of Bulwark (Epic) 1 -&gt; 3]</p><p>“Well, that’s to be expected,” I muttered as I examined the growth of the skill. If it was a Rare skill, the same mana attack would have comfortably raised it to double digits. However, under the circumstances, it barely raised by two points. </p><p>“No matter,” I said, then I went back to the fifth floor, and started targeting the insects. Facing an actual enemy, the growth of the skill increased significantly. Half an hour later, it was already nearly a hundred. I might have bypassed that point, but I slowed down, instead focusing on testing the limits of the mana attack. </p><p>The first thing was the shape of the mana attack. Instead of a sharp, wide, devastating wave, it turned into a shorter, stockier slash. As my skill was about to reach one hundred, it wasn’t as deadly as my previous attack, which was quite telling. </p><p>Relentless Blade had been truly a treasure among the Rare skills. Its disappearance was indeed a loss. </p><p>However, even with the reduced offensive potential, I was happy with the exchange. Ultimately, Blade of Bulwark was still an Epic skill instead of being just merely Rare, which meant an all-around improvement. </p><p>Another difference was the conceptual weight of every attack. The presence of my mana attacks was not only weaker — though it had been steadily climbing up as the skill had continued to improve — but also the general nature was subtly different. </p><p>Relentless Blade attacks radiated a feeling that deserved its name, sharp and unyielding, if a little bloodthirsty. In comparison, the Blade of Bulwark carried a restrained, steady sensation, which didn’t fit well with the concept of a ranged slashing attack, to the point that, for an equal amount of mana, its damage was considerably lower. </p><p> If it wasn’t for my newly acquired Wisdom, I probably would have wasted quite a bit of time trying to change the shape of the attack, which would have been a wasted effort. </p><p>Increasing its proficiency would help, but even at its completion, I wouldn’t be surprised if the ranged attack stayed inferior to my old skill. And, even if it surpassed, the increase would have been small and incremental, rather than the intense improvement I expected considering the chasm between Rare and Epic. </p><p>The significant weakening of the ranged attacks was a big loss. Or, it would have been if the skill didn’t come with its own significant benefits, including its own dense Vitality tricks from its Epic quality — which I certainly needed to find a better name for. </p><p>Tricks that I had yet to try. They were more focused on defense rather than offense, including various ways to use the Vitality to enhance both my armor and shield, turning what might be a deadly attack into a gentle bruise. </p><p>“At least, that’s the theory,” I muttered even as I flicked my sword, taking down half a dozen giant insects that were rushing toward me, leaving only an armored variant alive.</p><p>[Blade of Bulwark (Epic) 94 -&gt; 95]</p><p>One disadvantage of testing defensive skills was that I needed someone to attack me. Eleanor would have been an excellent sparring partner if she was here, but in her absence, the charging insects had to do. I raised my shield — which I created easily thanks to all the material lying around —  letting my Vitality cover the front. </p><p>[-100 Health]</p><p>The attack wasn’t intense enough to throw me back despite my improved Strength in the first place, but I didn’t feel even the push from the slam. The vitality not only took the damage, but it also somehow dealt with the momentum. </p><p>I had no idea how the mechanics of it worked, but I didn’t truly understand the other Vitality attacks either, but that hadn’t prevented me from creating mana variants — mostly relying on the skill as the basis. </p><p>Before my class upgrade, I would have created several composite weapons replicating the energy flow, and spend half a day or so to get a general proficiency. My newest stat gave me a faster path. I didn’t need to create composite shields in double digits, because thanks to Wisdom, I could memorize the flow and transformation of Health accurately. </p><p>Forcing my mana to flow those exact patterns was a bit more difficult, but even that could be achieved by a  few mana flares. It took me ten minutes to achieve an inferior effect through the application of my mana. It was not the dense variant, but with the amount of mana I had in my command, an inferior copy was enough to serve most of my needs. </p><p>“Now, to improve this skill, or upgrade the other two?” I muttered, but after a brief consideration, I decided to upgrade all three of them. Since both the hammer and spear skills were natural progressions, upgrading would keep the old trick available, while also unlocking new dense Vitality attacks I could employ during emergencies. </p><p>And, Blade of Bulwark had shown me that an Epic skill just below a hundred was better than a Rare one at two hundred, which was aligned with my old experience. Since I was confident that I could bring them to that level before nightfall, there was no substantial risk. </p><p>Also, it would allow me to enhance them further while fighting outside … something I was excited about, as it would give me a chance to level up further, something that I was very enthusiastic about since each level represented even more stat points. </p><p>And, since I was absorbing all the others, I also absorbed the Legendary Nurture, which, unlike the others, caused a slight discomfort. However, that momentary discomfort was easily ignored as I examined my latest class display. </p><p>[Smith of Decay - Level 50]</p><p>[Health 2900/3000] [Mana 2500/2500]</p><p>[Vitality 250 / Strength 200 / Dexterity 150 / Essence 250 / Wisdom 150]</p><p>[Skills (9/15)</p><p>Meditation of Decay (Mythic) - 100 [Controlled Flow, Superior Sensing, Purification]</p><p>Mana Repair (Epic) - 103 [Advanced Observe]</p><p>Mana Forge (Epic) - 313 [Advanced Creative Forging, Advanced Mana Control]</p><p>Nurture (Legendary) - 1</p><p>Hammer of Avalanche (Epic) - 1 </p><p>Blade of Bulwark (Epic) - 95</p><p>Spear of Storm (Epic) -1 </p><p>Fire Bolt (Basic) - 25 </p><p>Shoot (Basic) - 25]</p>",

    "content": "<p>“Well, this is intense,” I muttered as I stepped onto the fifth floor, only to be hit by the presence of ten boss monsters rushing toward me, fully intent on destruction. Based on the dungeon’s speed of production, their numbers should have been lower, but it seemed that there was a benefit to all that extra mana I had been pumping inside. </p><p>A good thing to know. </p><p>Their combined presence might have been scary before, but, right now, I was more inclined to treat them as an opportunity to create Epic and Legendary skills. Not the boss monsters themselves, as they had turned into the crystals that allowed me to strengthen my connection with the dungeon, but the giant horde they conveniently brought along. </p><p>Now that I had the mana to spare, I could easily deal with them. Ironically, piling them together before they disappeared was the bigger challenge. </p><p>Luckily, there was enough metal from my old hydroponic gardens to repurpose for a simple angled platform, where the monster corpses would just slip to the center to make sure they stayed touching each other. </p><p>With preparations done, all that remained was to wait for the boss monsters to attack. I continued to twirl my sword in hand, occasionally slashing the insect groups that arrived first, for once completely unafraid of their numbers even when ten gargantuan insects, along with their protective horde, approached me. </p><p>My lack of fear had two reasons. The first was the near-infinite mana that was under my command. Previously, I had to struggle for a long time against the gargantuan insects for a simple reason. I had to absorb mana between attacks, which allowed the boss monster to recover significantly, making it a battle of endurance, which they had in excess. With the infinite mana reserves allowing me to cast several full-strength attacks in a second, I was already confident that I could take that many enemies down at once. </p><p>Then, there was my improved Essence stat, which increased the upper range of my attack significantly. A full-powered attack, carrying the full might of two thousand and five hundred mana points at once could take down the boss. </p><p>“I just need to prevent it from destabilizing,” I muttered as I slashed my blade again, only to realize that, when the mana I put into the attack surpassed five hundred, it destabilized no matter how much I tried. Moreover, even before stabilizing, it was actually weaker, with its peak performance at around four hundred mana. </p><p>Why, I had no idea. “That’s what happens when one takes shortcuts,” I muttered even as I tried to improve the attack, only to fail again and again. </p><p>Not a big surprise when my approach to the mana attacks was to essentially pump mana to the attack in the correct shape, and let the weapon and the skill do the heavy lifting. It was a practical approach, useful as well considering my performance against various enemies, but it also meant that I lacked the necessary understanding to modify it when I faced a problem, like the one I had been facing. </p><p>Some options, like getting an epic skill, or a better quality epic or composite weapons were obvious, but how effective they would be was a question that would be answered once I dealt with the enemies and got a nice selection of skills that I could use. </p><p>When the first boss monster appeared, I aimed at its legs with repeated slashes, and once it lost the ability to move despite its regeneration ability, I focused on its body, the damage I was able to deal easily surpassed its limits. </p><p>Once the boss monster was down, I absorbed the crystal, and then dealt with the horde, piling them at the center, with their bodies fading away to turn into skill stones. I had done it happily, as killing monsters inside the dungeon, especially without separating the shell, was a good way to convert tainted energy to mana. </p><p>And, the dungeon even absorbed some of the mana slash, which didn’t disappear completely, so the act of farming skill stones was pretty sustainable. </p><p>I went down to the bottom of the artificial pit I had created, excited to see which skills I would find…</p><p>Four skills. Repair, Forge, Meditation, and for some reason, Nurture. Of the four, Repair and Forge were exclusively Common, and Meditation had two Epic ones mixed in, but most of them had been Rare or Uncommon. Only Nurture had gone high enough to reach Epic. </p><p>It surprised me. I quickly dealt with the other nine dungeon bosses, their crystals reinforcing the connection further, but the hordes that accompanied them gave nothing else. “Maybe the fifth floor had changed somewhat,” I muttered as I moved back to the fourth floor, then the third, then the second … until I was looking at a simple explanation. </p><p>Any creature killed by me was giving those four. Was that about the strength of my connection? </p><p>I went to Harold, who had a worried expression on his face when I found him, on the first floor. “Is something wrong?” I asked. </p><p>“Well, yes, sir,” he said. “The dungeon mist is getting thicker, and I’m afraid that—” </p><p>“Don’t worry about that part. It’s a part of my arrangements,” I replied. As dungeon mist was a part of the way the dungeon operated, the additional mana was put to use, enhancing the mist as well. “I want to know about the skills.” </p><p>“What about them, sir?” he said, looking honest. </p><p>“Was there any change on them, including their drop rate?” I asked. </p><p>Harold paused. “I don’t think so, sir. I have some teams hunting for skills. While we have enough reserves, having excess is never a bad idea, and they haven’t reported any changes.” </p><p>“But, you haven’t checked?” I pushed. </p><p>He looked reluctant. “No, sir … but, it’s an open secret that even when sent to such a mission, the teams would pocket some of the best skills. I can put a tighter control mechanism if you need, but I advise against it.” </p><p>I sighed in frustration. I could understand the reason for his hesitation. “No, the last thing I want is more Meditation skills,” I said. “Come with me for a moment,” I said as I opened a gate to the fourth floor, in the middle of the monsters. I stepped in first, growing a tree quickly to keep the monsters away. Harold followed a second later. “Do me a favor and kill a few hundred insects for me,” I said as I passed him my spear, as it was also a good time to raise his skills. </p><p>He nodded and followed my direction, killing the monsters under my gaze. I asked him to stop once he reached fifty. He brought me the skills, frowning. “They are…” he started, looking confused. </p><p>“Forge, Repair, Meditation, and Nurture,” I said. “Any idea why the dungeon suddenly stopped producing different skills?” I asked, just in case it was another common knowledge I missed. </p><p>He shook his head, stumped. “I have no idea, sir,” he admitted. “It’s my fault that I didn’t even realize it’s happening —” </p><p>“No, don’t worry about that,” I said. “I have piled enough tasks on you already. I know that it wasn’t like that before I took my trip,” I said. “Let’s have a talk with the guards to see why it’s the case.” </p><p>Harold nodded, and we went back to the third floor to talk with the guards responsible. They tried to deflect the situation, but they soon realized that, somewhere near dawn, the dungeon stopped dropping any of those skills but four.</p><p>They hid it because Meditation and Forge was potentially worth far more than the combat skills. To explain the discrepancy, they decided to put some from their personal stocks to replenish it.</p><p>“Should we punish them, sir?” Harold asked. </p><p>“Yes, but something mild,” I said. “It’s not worth creating chaos. Instead, I want you to use the four skills that the dungeon drops to put in exchange for the combat skills they have in their possession. One to one is okay.” </p><p>Harold paused. “You would make a great loss, sir,” he said. </p><p>I couldn’t help but chuckle. “Believe me. Money is the last thing we should care about currently. Those skills just turned into a strategic resource, and we need to ration them. You have the full responsibility there,” I said. </p><p>With that, Harold departed, ready to handle his most urgent tasks, while I went back to the fourth floor, wondering whether it was a side effect from my Class Upgrade, or whether it was a strategic meddling from our mysterious enemies. </p><p>The timing was in favor of the first case. “Let’s assume it’s the second,” I decided. The ease they had manipulated and weaponized the other dungeon had already suggested an advanced level of knowledge, and the fact that only Nurture remained was suspicious. </p><p>It was too convenient as a move to weaken our dungeon, especially by an enemy that wasn’t perfectly aware of the details. </p><p>“Ultimately, it doesn’t matter,” I said as I flipped open the storage I had been keeping the skills I had collected during my earlier adventures, the ones I couldn’t read earlier on a different location. </p><p>It was time to upgrade my capabilities. </p><p></p>",

    "content": "<p>Once I was on the fourth floor, I was ready to experiment once more. And, my first objective was to figure out a way to use mana offensively. </p><p>It didn’t look like the most effective strategy at first glance, but I had seen Maria fight. More importantly, with my class suddenly giving me more Essence than Strength, and with enough Wisdom to match Dexterity, I could actually be an effective mage. </p><p>One that is more than merely effective even, considering the amount of mana the dungeon could potentially supply me. </p><p>“If only there were no drawbacks to the connection,” I muttered. Admittedly, I didn’t know what side effects there were, except for the fact that I couldn’t move too far away from the dungeon, but I was almost certainly sure that there were many. </p><p>Otherwise, the dungeons would have been even more valuable commodities. </p><p>I raised my hand to target a thick iron wall, not willing to spend time on baseless theorizing when there was practical experimentation to be conducted. First, I started by targeting the wall from some distance, throwing simple balls of mana, more as a control group than anything else. Soon, I was forcing the mana to change shape, which didn’t go as well as I had hoped.</p><p>Even sending a simple slash, which I could achieve through my sword easily, proved to be more useless than expected. Which was a surprise. </p><p>“Maybe the skill was doing more of the work than I had realized,” I muttered. Just to test it, I created a dagger that was too small to trigger the sword skill before I repeated the trick. </p><p>Only for a slash to bite deep into the wall. </p><p>“Or, the weapon is doing more of the work,” I realized, correcting my thoughts. Before gaining Wisdom, I would have just written it off as the dagger somehow imbuing a sharp edge, but the Wisdom allowed me to notice something interesting.  </p><p>Even without the skill, the weapon was adding something to it. A metaphysical weight that I could detect through Wisdom. </p><p>I sighed, letting my mind wander as I tried to understand the additional reality. Everything I had done until today treated mana as a natural force, not unlike electricity. Yes, it was more mysterious and more unstable, but ultimately, it was merely a medium of energy. An idea that was helped by the fact that both Maria’s spells, and every single enchantment I had been able to get my hands on working on the same principles.  </p><p>“Maybe I was wrong.” Once again I sat down, trying to understand. Yes, I could repeat the various mana tricks hundreds of times to get a better sense, but that would be the approach of a barbarian. </p><p>Instead, I started pondering upon the simple idea. What was a concept? “Or, is a concept even an appropriate definition in the first place,” I muttered, realizing that I was falling for a dangerous fallacy. It was Maria who referred to Wisdom-based casting as conceptual casting, and while it didn’t seem like an inaccurate description, it didn’t necessarily mean that it fulfilled the whole range. </p><p>Unfortunately, a brief check of the skill stones didn’t reveal any new available skills -- well, other than the upgraded versions of the ones that I already had — which meant that there was no Wisdom-based casting available. </p><p>My Meditation was the only Wisdom-based skill I currently had, but I was reluctant to experiment with it, afraid of how things might end up. </p><p>“Back to the drawing board.” I moved to the anvil. Just because I had a new stat that was linked with the idea of sudden philo.optical enlightenment didn’t mean I would start sitting under a waterfall searching for epiphanies. </p><p>I was a scientist, and a fancy new stat didn’t change it. </p><p>And, like every experiment, a granular, systemic experimentation was the way to start. The daggers were a good basis, especially since I realized that the slash had some kind of conceptual existence. I had forged four types of daggers — single-edged with a curve, straight double-edged, modern combat knife, and stiletto — three different base materials — copper, iron, and silver — and four different qualities — ordinary, with dungeon materials, ordinary mana alloys, and epic quality. </p><p>Admittedly, it was a trivial experiment. My earlier experience had shown that epic daggers were much better at conveying stronger mana attacks, which implied that they would be the obvious winners; but that was not a good excuse for a lack of scientific rigor. </p><p>Sometimes, experiments existed to create a baseline —</p><p>“And, sometimes, they existed to teach arrogant scientists a lesson,” I muttered as I finished a mana attack from the first set of knives — copper, straight double-edged — only to find a very surprising result. </p><p>The ‘conceptual weight’ — which I decided to continue using until I could find a better definition — from the ordinary dagger was the strongest, while the epic dagger was the weakest, which promptly threw my assumptions into the garbage bin. </p><p>It didn’t mean that the mana attack from the epic dagger was any weaker. It was still by far the strongest, the most damaging, but for some reason, the conceptual weight I could feel was weaker. </p><p>It had multiple possible reasons for it, the simplest two being the stronger attacks shadowed the conceptual weight and made it harder to detect … my theory was completely wrong, and it had nothing to do with the ranged mana attacks from the weapons. </p><p>Naturally, those two reasons were nowhere close to creating a comprehensive space for all valid reasons, but they had a good start to explore. Even if they didn’t give me the rule I had been trying to unearth, they would point me in a better direction. </p><p>“At least, they should,” I muttered, but before I moved to the next set, I used every other dagger I had crafted, even repeating the process with attacks of different strength. </p><p>As I worked, I realized another nice benefit of having Wisdom. I didn’t actually need to write down the experiment results. They were clear in my mind, like I had spent a night working hard to memorize them verbatim before a critical meeting. </p><p>I still wrote them down, including the appropriate notation and labeling, and I even placed them on a new shelf with the appropriate daggers. </p><p>Having magical stats wasn’t a good excuse to bypass proper experiment procedures. History was filled with people who decided they were too good to benefit from proper scientific procedures, often ending in humiliation. </p><p>And, with the way the world was, I doubted that my bad end would be limited to career death. </p><p>Once the experiment was completed, I noticed some interesting details. The type of metal didn’t play a role when it came to conceptual weight, but whether it was magical or not, or whether it included dungeon materials did. </p><p>Why, I didn’t have the slightest idea. </p><p>Meanwhile, by alternating the mana strength of the attacks, I was halfway convinced that the attack strength or integrity didn’t conceal the conceptual weight, nor did it exactly enhance it. As for whether it had anything to do with the damage, it was harder to test. </p><p>“How about a composite dagger,” I muttered after sitting for a minute, remembering how I used various weapons with gold and silver cores with various geometric shapes to channel the mana and vitality, therefore enhancing the efficiency significantly. </p><p> They allowed me to use more complicated attacks, which allowed me to improve my Rare combat skills rapidly. It was time to use them to increase my understanding of concepts. I rapidly forged one composite dagger and used it for a ranged mana attack. </p><p>It didn’t go exactly as smoothly as I had expected. </p><p>The attack from the composite dagger had an even weaker presence. Significantly so, to the point of being shocking. The conceptual weight was not something that was easy to quantify other than identifying them as lesser and greater in intensity, but if the conceptual weight of an ordinary dagger was a hundred, the epic one had a weight of about seventy. </p><p>The composite dagger, which had created a beautiful curved mana slash that had cut even deeper than the epic dagger I had used earlier, only had the presence of one. </p><p>“It doesn’t make sense,” I muttered, frustration battling with excitement. Frustration because my initial hypotheses that seemed obvious, to the point that I only checked them to fulfill the principles of scientific rigor rather than expecting them to be inaccurate, turned out to be flat-out wrong, in a way that didn’t make any sense. </p><p>The excitement was there, because such surprising results had the potential to turn into something truly incredible. </p><p>Unfortunately, there was also a drawback. Predictable results meant experimentation horizons were equally predictable, while radical results represented a quagmire, the kind that consumed the lives and the ambitions of the scientists. </p><p>I wasn’t afraid of tackling that, of course, but the growing number of lizards, not to mention the other threats meant that I didn’t have the luxury of ignoring the low-hanging fruits that could improve my combat potential. </p><p>It was time to move to the fifth floor to hunt. </p><p>I needed more skill stones. </p>",

    "content": "<p>When I arrived on the first floor, I was met with a surprise. Not an unpleasant one. Far from it.  </p><p>I could see fifty people, a combination of farmers and blacksmiths, led by Terry, working around a new workshop, with endless wooden shelves near them, filled with both bows and crossbows and at least a dozen ballistas. </p><p>“Someone has been busy in my absence,” I said. Every worker flinched in surprise. </p><p>“Sir,” several gasps rose, shocked by my presence. Not that I blamed them, the sudden visit from one’s boss was never pleasant, especially since that boss had the power over their life and death. I could feel most of them radiating fear, while Terry and a few others radiated excitement — </p><p>That brought me to a stop. “Something wrong, sir?” Terry asked. </p><p>“No, just examining the weapons,” I said as I walked toward him. “They look good,” I added while I touched the first crossbow. My words were just to distract them from my awkward pause, but ultimately, it wasn’t a lie. The crossbows looked impressive enough. The metal parts were easy to understand, but the same wasn’t true for the wood or the string. “Explain to me how you did it.” </p><p>“With pleasure, sir,” he said. “I’m sure you have no need for an explanation when it comes to metal parts,” he said. I nodded. I detected their structure already, and they were merely a copy of the other crossbows we were able to purchase. “The real challenge was to create a type of wood that maintained the necessary strength and endurance while also not burning up when the lizards with fire aura drifted closer,” he explained. </p><p>I nodded, acting like I was aware of the lizard variant he had mentioned. </p><p>I was not, but it was reasonable progress, and asking follow-up questions would mean revealing unnecessary secrets. </p><p>Instead, I listened to him talk about how they created an assembly line to optimize production, busying myself with a sudden new understanding when it came to the emotions of others, which was clearly another benefit of Wisdom. </p><p>Which, admittedly, had been a little problem I had. It wasn’t that I couldn’t understand people, but it was one I had cultivated through working in a hostile work environment for a decade, where I had learned to pick up micro-expressions carefully rather than the kind of instinctual understanding people had. I had gotten pretty good at it, but that was nothing compared to the instinctual understanding Wisdom started to provide. </p><p>It was an interesting experience, but ultimately, it didn’t matter too much under the current circumstances, particularly since my position in the dungeon meant that everyone's feelings toward me were quite intense. People who disliked me did it intensely, while the ones who were in favor of me were almost fanatical in their expression of their fascination. </p><p>However, I had a feeling it would get useful when we had to deal with the inevitable spies … I just hoped that we could survive enough that spies became a problem once more. </p><p>“Impressive,” I said once he finished his explanation. Wisdom proved useful once more, helping me to not miss anything he had spoken despite letting myself get distracted. It wasn’t as impressive as the multitasking from Intelligence, but a stronger memory allowed me to repeat the same thing. “But, you need to be more careful about the production line,” I said after pointing at several mistakes. Some of them were one-offs, some persistent. “Maybe think of implementing quality checks for individual pieces before the assembly.” </p><p>“A good idea, sir,” he said. “Maybe that can help us with the ballistas as well. We’re having trouble getting them right.” </p><p>I recognized the implied request for help. “Work on it another day, and if you still can’t figure it out, I’ll have a look,” I promised before walking away, which had two objectives. One was for the tasks to fit into my rather tight schedule. Helping the dungeon recover its mana was critical, and so was exploring the advantages — and possible blind spots — of Wisdom before I faced a dangerous situation. </p><p>More importantly, I was already impressed with the initiative they were showing in creating the crossbows and the ballistas. Admittedly, I much rather see some kind of steam-powered bolt launcher than an inferior ballista, but every bit of initiative was welcome. </p><p>Once outside, I met with an improved encampment, with Harold leading the construction of an outer line. “It looks good,” I called. </p><p>“Sir,” Harold said, his attitude stern, but with Wisdom, I could also feel his sudden relief at my appearance, which contrasted greatly with the disdain and the disappointment of the other guards. </p><p>“Come here and give me a report,” I called loudly, and he approached. I led him back into the dungeon, away from the others before we started speaking. “First question, how long have I been gone for,” I asked. </p><p>“You were away for one night, sir,” he answered professionally. He did look somewhat surprised, but not too much. After all, there were too many credible reasons to suddenly lose a day when magic was concerned. </p><p>“Good. Is anything worthwhile to report? Start from the good news.” </p><p>“The best news is that we managed to handle the night with no losses, and we have another thousand farmers ready to upgrade their classes,” he said. “The new ranged weapons, in particular, are coming in quite handy.” </p><p>“That’s good news indeed,” I said. “How about the lizard claws, do we have enough to help them level up?” </p><p>“The last time I checked, the number was just below two hundred thousand, sir,” he said. </p><p>“That much, yet no losses. Very impressive,” I said, but my compliment didn’t change his attitude. “And, the bad news.” </p><p>“The guards, sir. They are getting … restless. Lady Eleanor’s orders are enough to keep them obedient for now, but not forever, especially as they level up,” he said. “They are getting more confident, and with that…” </p><p>“They believe that they should lead the camp rather than an upstart blacksmith,” I added. He looked ready to argue, but I waved it off. “Don’t worry about it. I’m not bothered,” I said. “But, we might need to look toward improving your capabilities faster,” I said. “As long as you’re strong enough, they should be dissuaded.” </p><p>“It’s probably not a good idea, sir,” he said, which was impressive because I could feel his excitement toward the idea. “I’m doing my best to hide the full length of my improvements, but sooner or later, I’ll slip, and they’ll get suspicious.” </p><p>I paused. He was right, and while after my class upgrade, I was considerably more confident in holding the dungeon under control, it didn’t mean that inviting trouble was the smart thing to do. “Alright. Pick an external skill, and we’ll make sure to improve it further,” I said, making a note to do the same as well. </p><p>With my Stats upgraded, I could equip Epic skills at a minimum, and maybe even Legendary ones might be possible — assuming the current dungeon created them in the first place. </p><p>“That makes sense, sir. That way, I can keep it concealed easily,” he admitted. </p><p>“Good. Now, go and arrange farmers for me to level up. Ten at a time,” I said, then went out once more. </p><p>None of the other guards approached me, their fear and disdain keeping them back, not that I blamed them. </p><p>Not with my suspicions about how the System affected our mentality. </p><p>I started operating the crusher before Harold came with the first farmers, not wanting to lose any time. The pipe leading to the gate pumped the mana directly toward the dungeon gate, letting the dungeon refresh its mana. </p><p>I sighed. With my connection with the dungeon, it felt similar to finding water after getting lost in a desert for a week. Too bad I needed to drink a lot of water. With what my class change had consumed, it would take at least a week to replenish the reserves —</p><p>Or not, I corrected the moment I ran my Meditation skill, expecting the tainted energy from the claws to stick at the cloud of decay for a second before it disappeared, only for it to happen instantaneously. </p><p>My eyes widened as I let larger and larger amounts of tainted energy, only for them to disappear instantly. Then, I slapped my head, realizing I had missed something completely obvious. </p><p>That my meditation technique was a conceptual one, empowered by Wisdom. Significantly so, if the performance was any indicator. I was expecting to spend at least one second per claw, which would mean that, even if I dedicated a full half of my day to it without a pause — the most I could reasonably do with everything else I needed to address — it would have meant I could process forty thousand a day at most, likely less considering all the miscellaneous steps slowing me down. </p><p>But, empowered by Wisdom, the Meditation technique operated with a speed that was worthy of its rank, devouring the tainted energy instantly while I increased the rate. I continued to crash the claws. Some of it I used to help the farmers to advance their class, but the most, I just crushed to support the dungeon, which had worked wonders to not only replenish the reserves out of the dangerous point it was in, but also give me enough mana to experiment. </p><p>I saved only about ten thousand claws, which I planned to bring with me to the fourth floor for experimentation. </p><p>I returned to the dungeon an hour later, for once glad for my unwanted leadership position. While many details were a big chore, one thing was certainly valuable. </p><p>I didn’t need to argue for days for grants and resources. </p><p>Silver linings. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Let’s start with something simple,” I said then closed my eyes, doing nothing. The simplest thing was to test the rawest representation of the Stat. For Strength, it was punching things. For Intelligence, it was calculations. </p><p>For Wisdom, it was memory. </p><p>I closed my eyes, and focused on the moments from the past. </p><p>Ever since I was a child, I have been smart in a conventional sense. A part of it was the ease I had with numbers and complicated concepts, but my memory had played quite a part as well. I just needed to read something a few times to commit to my memory, and the core stuck with me. </p><p>But, comparing that with my current experience was impossible. I just needed to close my eyes, and every book I had read, including the adventure novels I had read as a child, popped with perfect recall. </p><p>It was a fascinating feeling … but also a disquieting one. Yes, I was familiar with the ways the Stats had transformed me fundamentally, but there was a great difference between the ability to casually carry weights measured in tons and one that fundamentally changed the way I had processed information. </p><p>The worst part, I couldn’t bring myself to be unhappy about it. Not when it would give me an incredible advantage in everything I was doing. Suddenly having a perfect recall meant that everything I had learned, including the offhand discussions between two unrelated academics could be turned into assets. </p><p>More importantly, it was far from the only way it helped. I raised my finger, and a tiny glob of mana appeared on my finger. Before, I could barely manipulate it through my full focus, often using the composite weapons as a guide for more complicated tricks. </p><p>Yet,  the mana danced over my fingers, transforming between states. Not just between more gaseous, liquid, or denser states, but actually turning into decay and back. A completely new type of understanding, one that ran contrary to everything I had been experimenting with. </p><p>Up until now, every single experiment I had conducted had treated mana as a material, one that required external forces to be controlled, be it shapes, pressure, or sheer willpower, all based on Intelligence-based spell casting. But, looking from the perspective of Wisdom, I could feel that it was more. </p><p>Far more. </p><p>Instinctually, it felt like conceptual manipulation was far superior to the alternative … but it was a baseless thought, built upon a sudden sense of empowerment. That much, I was sure of, especially since my memory allowed me to recall the sheer devastation Maria was able to create. </p><p>It was a difficult piece of evidence to clear. </p><p>I continued to sit on the metal floor, breathing deeply as I tried to separate the real from the elation from acquiring new sensations. It was difficult, as the influence of Wisdom was pervasive across my thoughts. </p><p>I felt like it brought me comprehension, an instinctual understanding of the ‘truth’ but I was very reluctant to believe that. I had spent my whole career fighting against other people’s ‘trivial and obvious’ conclusions about the concepts that they claimed to understand. </p><p>Admittedly, I might be wrong, and the understanding from Wisdom might actually be true, but I doubted it. It almost certainly had some critical weaknesses. Maybe it was weaknesses that could be bypassed easily, similar to the way Maria played chess, her strategic mistakes easily covered by her tactical acuity. </p><p> Or, it might carry a much bigger blind spot. One that I was reluctant to truly assess. </p><p>I wished someone I could trust was here. Maria would be my first option, her strong magical competencies allowing me to delve deeper into the concept of Wisdom, with Eleanor being a close second. Ironically, I found myself wishing that Rosie was here as well, who seemed to be aware of more things than I had expected — </p><p>That train of thought had been interrupted by several memories. Admittedly, being interrupted was a bit of exaggeration, as it wasn’t a sudden, intrusive flashback, but a gentle remembrance. Just like how mentioning something is sometimes accompanied by older memories. </p><p>In my case, remembering Rosie’s name had brought along a deluge of memories, which, admittedly, was the case for Eleanor and Maria as well. The ones about Rosie made me freeze for one simple reason. </p><p>They were from before the Cataclysm. </p><p>“Well, that’s … something,” I muttered even as I closed my eyes, focusing on the past, and the memories that came with it. If it wasn’t for the flawless recall, which had allowed me to reconstruct the scenes with an accuracy that I could never have imagined to be possible, I was ready to dismiss them as nonsense. </p><p>But, it was not. I could remember many times Rosie was in the background as I walked around the campus. I might have been willing to believe that it was a coincidence, that she was a student of another department and nothing else, but two things changed my mind. </p><p>First, she only appeared six weeks before the Cataclysm, with no sign of being on campus beforehand. I was sure of it, because Wisdom didn’t only give memory, but also a strong recall ability, one that allowed me to search for relevant memories with relative ease. </p><p>Then, there was the number of times I could remember her in the background. Treated alone, every single of them could be written as a coincidence, but looked together, the pattern was clear. </p><p>Every single one of those memories, she was in the background, alone, busy with a perfectly innocent task, but her gaze was always following me. </p><p>“What a mess,” I muttered. Admittedly, I didn’t know if it was actually true, or even if it was, what it actually meant. I didn’t even know if the memories of those scenes were completely accurate. </p><p>I didn’t expect the memories to be complete illusions, but the way we remembered the past, especially when it came to audiovisual memory, was sketchy at best; that much I knew even if it wasn’t my field of expertise. </p><p>And, even if it was accurate, just by pointing me to  Maria and Eleanor, she deserved an earnest discussion. Even if she had an ulterior motive, she had earned that. </p><p>“That doesn’t make it any less confusing,” I muttered before deciding to ignore it.</p><p>Once again, I focused inward, but this time, my focus wasn’t on my memories, no matter how fascinating it was to summon every scrap of knowledge I had touched. It was distracting. Maybe I would stop and try to develop that famous mind-palace to keep those intrusive thoughts more organized. </p><p>Yet, the moment I thought that, the flow of random memories ceased, showing that it was easier to control than I had expected. </p><p>“But then, I shouldn’t be surprised. After all, Strength didn’t make us break every single wall by accident like a drunk superhero,” I said while I turned my attention to the other benefit. </p><p>The ability to transform mana. I tried to shuffle its shape rather than nature, trying to create the complicated patterns that I had seen from Maria, but those were outside my reach. Admittedly, I could shape the mana smoother, but it was similar to how Farmers were able to lift more when their Vitality increased, but not to a point that could rival Strength. </p><p>Similarly, I could feel that my improved Essence gave me more flexibility, but not in any way that could rival Intelligence, especially not at the level Maria had displayed. </p><p>I still experimented with altering its form, shaping it into complex geometries, and weaving it into intricate patterns, but the limits soon became obvious.  </p><p>Yet, when it came to transforming the nature of the mana directly, it was incredibly effective. I raised my hand, using my Fire Bolt skill, which still took the same amount of time to occur. Its impact was somewhat elevated, but not enough to justify its great impact. </p><p>Then, I raised my finger, and focused on replicating the same effect without all those patterns. I just infused the idea of fire to the mana, and it flew forward. </p><p>[-100 Mana]</p><p>It hit against the metal, only to actually melt the metal I had targeted. </p><p>I gulped. “Well, that’s more than I had expected,” I muttered even as I examined the results. It wasn’t made of the fire-resistant material, but that didn’t change the fact that it was not only metal, but a supernaturally-enhanced one, and melting such a thing wasn’t exactly easy. </p><p>Yet, my offhanded experiment was enough to achieve such a result. But then, maybe my shock was misplaced, as a few points of any stats were enough to fundamentally change everything, and the Wisdom I had received was hardly a few points, meaning it was more of a fundamental transformation than just an experimental one. </p><p>I needed to be careful testing its limits … later. As much as I wanted to experiment with my latest stat, I was receiving the constant signal of mana deficiency from the dungeon, which was surprisingly similar to thirst. </p><p>I rose from my meditation with a renewed sense of purpose. There was much to be done, but with my latest upgrade, which had been far more impressive than I had expected, I felt equipped to actually deal with them. </p><p>I opened another gate. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Lost in excitement and fear in equal amounts, the decision to stay near the dungeon until the sun had risen properly to disperse the energy of the night was easy to make. Only after no lizard waves had been triggered despite releasing multiple blasts of tainted energy — both fire and corrosion — I decided to retreat.</p><p>“Good work, everyone,” I called. “Be proud of defending your home against the monsters. Tomorrow will be much easier!”</p><p>It was a short speech, but it didn’t matter. The guards, led by their instinctive revulsion at being ruled by a production class member, wouldn’t listen, and the mood of the Farmers was too high to care about speeches. The gains they had achieved, both in terms of level and combat skills, were enough to keep them happy for a few days.</p><p>And, I doubted that I could give a proper speech, not when I was occupied by the choice in front of me.</p><p>Not that there was any other real option for my ultimate choice despite the creepy name. There was only one class that carried the name of my overpowered Meditation skill that almost killed me, one that leaned even more into my connection with the dungeon.</p><p>It was another blind choice, but at this point, I was getting used to it.</p><p>Once I entered the dungeon, I directly opened the gate to the fourth floor, which was the safest place to go through the class upgrade under the circumstances.</p><p>And, I chose Smith of Decay.</p><p>[Class upgrade - 01%]</p><p>Immediately, I felt the mana drain, this time moving to the opposite side, draining the dungeon of it. I expected to stay still while the class upgrade progressed calmly, but that was not the case.</p><p>Instead, my gaze faded, and I once again found myself floating in a dream. It was different this time. Not a grand, cataclysmic battle like before, but something more intimate, more focused. I stood at the edge of a dense, alien forest, the air filled with the hum of insect wings. Around me, strange trees reached toward a sky that shimmered with a perpetual twilight. Their bark glistened with a bioluminescent glow, casting eerie shadows over the land.</p><p>A sight that felt strangely homely despite looking like a landscape from a horror movie.</p><p>However, while it was not a battlefield, it was not free of violence either. Two groups of humanoid insects were fighting. One group was the one I had seen in my dreams, their carapaces were decorated intricately, and they fought with precision. Each one carried weapons crafted from various materials, ranging from metal to obsidian, and their formations were as precise as their weapons.</p><p>The other side, however, was far more animalistic. They carried no weapons, nor did they show any kind of tactical brilliance. They just rushed forward relentlessly, their weird cries enough to unsettle me.</p><p>However, one thing was clear. Despite their horrid mutations, it was clear that both groups belonged to the same roots, not changed by the chaotic abandon.</p><p>The battle unfolded as I watched, the alien war cries mixing with the death cries of the insects. The defending side was winning, but not without taking some losses. More importantly, I could read a sense of familiarity from the way they fought, one that signaled that it wasn’t the first time they were experiencing that battle.</p><p>Yet, even with their losses, they didn’t despair. Instead, they fought with a fluidity that suggested years of practice. Every thrust of a spear, every block with a shield, was calculated. When one warrior faltered, another stepped into their place without hesitation.</p><p>A tragic battle, one that looked like it would go on forever as the corrupted ones threatened to overwhelm them in great numbers. For everyone that fell, two more took their place. The creatures swarmed like a plague, forcing the disciplined warriors to retreat step by step, their tight formation fraying under the relentless assault.</p><p>Until, a familiar figure appeared. The giant insect with the staff, was one that I had seen during the earlier battle. It wasn’t as large, and the golden runes over his carapace weren't as bright, but somehow, I was confident that it was the same insect.</p><p>I watched from a distance as it waved the staff, and a suffocating aura of decay destroyed the corrupted insects en masse. I couldn’t help but feel fascinated by the display, especially since I had my own Meditation skill modeled after it.</p><p>The spell was far more intense than the decay I had sensed in my Meditation skill, not to mention far more layered.</p><p>Once the battle ended, I felt the world shift, and I found myself in a vast, underground chamber, covered with obsidian walls, intersected with the same bioluminescent wood that grew in the forest, providing a dim light.</p><p>It was a council meeting.</p><p>I couldn’t understand the language, if it was even a mainly audible language in the first place. I could only read their body language, their posture and gestures barely hinting at the emotions behind their discussions.</p><p>At the center, the same giant insect I had seen earlier stood rigid, in a way I read as defiance. It gestured around the others who circled around him, who seemed to treat the discussion negatively.</p><p>It was not much, but understanding that much alone was something impossible. I shouldn’t have been able to read their completely alien body language, but I somehow caught the general perspective.</p><p>It was highlighting a sense of emergency, a plea for assistance.</p><p>Another leader stepped forward, its carapace a deep obsidian black. It radiated authority, though its posture was even more rigid than the others, his position clearly negative.</p><p>Both parties had supporters and detractors, the discussion growing more heated, until finally, the one with golden runes declared something, threw down his staff, and left the council room.</p><p>No other insect followed, but the shock that defined the room was palpable. Whatever had happened, it was big, incomprehensibly so, though whether the trespass was political, social, or religious, I had no idea.</p><p>Maybe a combination of all three.</p><p>I had a feeling that he would get back that staff, as both its age and its position indicated that the desperate last stand I had watched belonged to a later timeline.</p><p>But, before I could receive an answer one way or another, the world shifted once more, and I was back on the fourth floor, at my lab, breathing hard. But, unlike the last time, I wasn’t writhing in pain, which seemed like a big victory.</p><p>Before doing anything else, I closed my eyes, focusing on the dungeon entrance. It was midday, but a quick examination showed that at least one day had passed.</p><p>Still, the defenders were calm and orderly, showing that the passage of time hadn’t caused any devastating losses, which was more than what I could have hoped for.</p><p>But, even as I glanced through the connection, I noticed the sight was clearer, requiring far less effort. The same was true for my surroundings. Everything was the same … yet different. I didn’t require my full genius to guess it likely had something to do with my new class.</p><p>I summoned the screen, only to gasp in shock.</p><p>[Smith of Decay - Level 50]</p><p>[Health 3000/3000] [Mana 2500/2500]</p><p>[Vitality 250 / Strength 200 / Dexterity 150 / Essence 250 / Wisdom 150]</p><p>[Skills (9/15)</p><p>Meditation of Decay (Mythic) - 100 [Controlled Flow, Superior Sensing, Purification]</p><p>Mana Repair (Epic) - 103 [Advanced Observe]</p><p>Mana Forge (Epic) - 313 [Advanced Creative Forging, Advanced Mana Control]</p><p>Nurture (Epic) - 219</p><p>Quake Hammer (Rare) - 200 [Persistent Tremor]</p><p>Blade of Retribution (Rare) - 200 [Strike of Retribution]</p><p>Breeze Spear (Rare) - 200 [Floating Stride]</p><p>Fire Bolt (Basic) - 25</p><p>Shoot (Basic) - 25]</p><p>My gasp of shock was followed by a chuckle. Somehow, after dreaming of Intelligence for years, I ended up with the other mental stat.</p><p>Wisdom.</p><p>“Okay, what do I do with it?” I muttered though those words weren’t some kind of reluctant rejection. I had no doubt that it was a treasure. No stat was useless, that much was clear, and receiving such a strong variant was certainly an incredible opportunity.</p><p>However, it was also one stat I had no idea how to handle, so I tried to focus on the others I could comprehend first. It was a good habit to experiment. When facing a complicated topic, I preferred to focus on parts I could understand first.</p><p>Here, the problem — if I call it that a problem in the first place — was that I knew exactly how to handle the other stats. Strength would allow me to hit harder as well as help me to work with the metal smoothly, Essence would allow me to handle more mana, Dexterity would make me more flexible both in a fight and during work, and Vitality was equally clear.</p><p>Yes, there were many strategies I could focus on, but for once, I found myself unable to focus on anything but the unknown, my methodological approach failing me.</p><p>It was experimentation time.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The wave of fire lizards climbed the mountain as a devastating tide threatened to drown us. The rain of arrows from the crossbows reduced their numbers somewhat, but they were still abundant enough to send tendrils of fear through defenders. </p><p>Thousands of lizards climbing the mountain was a scary sight. </p><p>I shifted to my sword, which was the best to deal with the enemies like the lizards. I sent multiple slashes, each. </p><p>“Don’t worry,” I called while I slashed my blade dozens of times, each attack carrying my full power. While I didn’t want to waste too much mana, it was better than risking lives. Especially since we were yet to understand the limits of the new variants. There was a chance that some of the lizards looked near-identical from outside, but had much greater speed or strength. </p><p>And, it wasn’t like it was a great loss, as the claws would be able to replenish the losses easily. </p><p>[-210 Mana]</p><p>…</p><p>[-210 Mana]</p><p>Now that there was a significant density of beasts attacking, each attack took down hundreds of lizards, reducing the number to a more manageable level, which had been only achieved once thousands had fallen.

It was not exactly a problem I had been expecting, but maybe I should have. I remembered Eleanor explicitly mentioning that the monsters outside didn’t have the same hard limit the dungeon monsters had. </p><p>“Well, that was not a problem I expected,” I muttered even as I checked the remains. “Harold, you’re up. Show me how good your trainees are,” I ordered loudly as I retreated back, ready to intervene if necessary. </p><p>As he took over, holding the front line with the twenty newly upgraded farmers he had been leading, I moved to the back, ready to intervene in case of an emergency. But, there was none, which left me free to focus on my next problem. </p><p>My class upgrade. </p><p>It was not a problem I had thought about for a while, mostly because I assumed that it couldn’t be solved in short order. Of course, that was before I realized I could use the dungeon as a source of infinite mana, which gave me the ability to kill monsters en masse. </p><p>Thousands of monsters fell under my power in less than a minute. I paused for a moment, making a few rough calculations. I didn’t know the exact curve of effectiveness when it came to higher levels, but any reasonable estimate indicated that, unless I retreated back to the dungeon, I could push to level fifty. </p><p>Potentially settling for a weaker class in the process, since I hadn’t pushed Forge to the next level.</p><p>It was a tougher decision than I had expected, owing to my Meditation, which was already at its Mythic variant, which should have given me a class that was significantly stronger than the one I had, potentially with some mental stats to compensate. </p><p>The mere thought was enough to excite me. Having access to Intelligence could potentially open a new world to me, one where I could truly start experimenting with mana. But, to make that more likely, I needed to push my Mana Forge and Mana Repair skills above epic.</p><p>Frustratingly, it was actually possible. A week, maybe two at most, and I could actually achieve it. But, that would mean monopolizing the mana from the lizards, which would mean no widespread class upgrades for the farmers. </p><p>Not even new weapons, as that would mean I would have to focus on weapons that were complicated to the point of uselessness in the hopes of triggering the System,  even co-opting a great part of the new blacksmiths to understand the way the System behaved. </p><p>Doing so would mean casualties. Many of them. Without me to whittle the large portions of the waves, the defenses wouldn’t hold. </p><p>A big part of me wanted to ignore those deaths. Why would it matter if a few hundred Farmers died while enabling my growth? Would that really matter? Didn’t they owe me for saving their lives and providing all those opportunities in the process? If they joined any other expedition, their death rate would certainly be more than half, so it should mean that I was morally in the clear, right? </p><p>Not to mention, it was a strategic decision every general could understand, sacrificing a portion of their forces to ensure ultimate victory. My abilities were the only thing that was keeping them truly safe, and making sure my improvements were significant enough mattered even more. </p><p>I had no doubt that I could explain it to Maria and Eleanor, and get them to admit that I made the right decision. It was a simple decision, one that resonated with me both rationally and emotionally. </p><p>I watched the newly improved farmer-warriors finish the last of the lizards, coming to a decision. </p><p>“You have five minutes to gather all the claws,” I shouted. “We will have a second wave soon. We can’t let them pile up!” Then, I turned to Harold. “Pick twenty more farmers for me, we will need another squad soon.” </p><p>I had made my decision. </p><p>A stupid, inefficient one, one that didn’t make sense under the circumstances. But, as I looked at the Farmers, I found myself unable to do anything else. </p><p>I had asked them for their loyalty and hard work, and I promised them protection. I couldn’t violate that, not in such a ruthless fashion. </p><p>While Harold arranged the next batch, I went back into the dungeon, but only to pick about a hundred tons of metal, which took multiple trips. Only about ten tons of it was anti-fire, while the majority of it was anti-corrosive iron. </p><p>Not due to any special strategic reason, but because we had an abundance of it. I also brought along a few blacksmiths to handle building the encampment — which was merely a low wall and metal floors — and while they were busy setting the defenses, I started creating a larger crusher to enable leveling, which had three critical features. </p><p>One, it allowed leveling up to twenty farmers at once, which was enough for our purposes. Two, it had several layered storages buried deep underground with enough units to hold the tainted energy from almost a hundred class upgrades at once, which was a significant upgrade. </p><p>Three, it had the ability to channel out both the mana and the tainted energy. Another quick experiment showed that the dungeon gate was more than happy to take in the pure mana as long as it was brought right underneath it, while it had multiple exhausts for tainted energy to make the act of drawing the lizards toward the gate easier. </p><p>It was a simplistic structure, mostly underground pipes I built directly with my mana, but it didn’t make it any less useful. </p><p>Once that was complete, the rest of the night passed in an acceptable, predictable pattern. I used the excess tainted energy to bait the lizards from a great distance, used the mana to cut them aggressively, including their giant variants, used their claws for mana while rolling their bodies down the hill for the other creatures to feast on, keeping them close to the mountain. </p><p>I had a few breaks, where I went back to the third floor with a cartful of claws to rapidly create some extra metal, some of it to be used for the defense, while the rest had been left behind for extra weapons and arrows. </p><p>But, even during the rush, one certain notification continued to ring. </p><p>[Level 44 -&gt; 45]</p><p>[+2 Vitality, +2 Strength, +2 Dexterity]</p><p>[Level 45 -&gt; 46]</p><p>[+2 Vitality, +2 Strength, +1 Dexterity, +1 Essence]</p><p>[Level 46 -&gt; 47]</p><p>[+2 Vitality, +2 Strength, +2 Dexterity]</p><p>[Level 47 -&gt; 48]</p><p>[+2 Vitality, +2 Strength, +1 Dexterity, +1 Essence]</p><p>[Level 48 -&gt; 49]</p><p>[+2 Vitality, +2 Strength, +2 Dexterity]</p><p>I continued to fight against the waves as dawn set, which was not exactly accidental. After several levels, I was able to calculate how many new lizards were required to level up — the answer being in low ten thousand — and used the extra time to focus on creating some extra materials for the other blacksmiths, help more farmers level up, and even adding several contingency plans in place. </p><p>Between two breaks, I gestured at Harold, bringing him back to the dungeon to prevent eavesdroppers. “How can I help you, sir?” he asked. </p><p>“I’m going to be away for some time. It shouldn’t be more than a few hours, but in case it gets delayed, I have some orders for you,” I said, and gave him several directives, including where I hid the weapons I designed to quickly level up the common and uncommon combat skills dropped by the dungeon. </p><p>“You can trust me, sir,” he promised. </p><p>I nodded, hoping that was the case. Not that I had any other options. He was literally my only option. </p><p>With that, we returned back to the plains, the guards looking exhausted after a night of fighting, but none of them complained. Though, that had nothing to do with my sudden expertise as a leader. As guards, their levels were not yet fifty, meaning they benefited from the killing just as I did. </p><p>Not enough to level up six times in one night, but then they weren’t killing lizards by the hundreds — </p><p>No, I corrected it. Seven times. </p><p>[Level 49 -&gt; 50]</p><p>[+2 Vitality, +2 Strength, +1 Dexterity, +1 Essence]</p><p>[Class Upgrade: Mana Blacksmith / Master Blacksmith / Expert Mana Mender / Smith of Decay]</p>",

    "content": "<p>While Harold sent in the next candidate, I turned my attention to the tainted energy, split between four boxes. Even with the several layers of protection, they were still letting out some, which was dispersed by the dungeon gate with great speed, confirming that leaving the boxes alone to slowly evaporate was a valid strategy in small numbers. </p><p>Not exactly the greatest method, but a method nonetheless, which was better than doing nothing. </p><p>I cracked open one of the boxes, watching the tainted energy disperse, only to notice that the tainted energy leaving the box as a thin line, but still being pushed away. I closed the gap, and instead repeated it to leave in the form of smaller pieces, and watch them disperse. </p><p>Analyzing it like that gave me a good way to disperse the energy, but I wasn’t sure if that was true. Yes, it didn’t immediately summon a horde of monsters, but that might have been more about the fact that they had been throwing down boxes filled with tainted energy all day, keeping the mountain clean of lizards for the moment. </p><p>One match wouldn’t have melted an igloo, but the same wouldn’t be true for a full bonfire. </p><p>As for opening the boxes, I decided to leave it at least until the number of upgraded farmers had reached a certain point, maybe even after they had improved their competency somewhat. Handled well, they should be able to use Uncommon skills after the upgrade, and I had experienced just how effective a maxed-out uncommon skill could be. </p><p>I just needed to maximize their skills without doing the same for the guards, at least not until Harold managed to identify some trustworthy ones.</p><p>But, as I watched Harold handle the raffle to pick the next lucky five, I decided to do one more experiment. One skill that might give me a way to handle the tainted energy. </p><p>[Meditation of Decay (Mythic) - 100 [Controlled Flow, Superior Sensing, Purification]]</p><p>I distinctly remembered it pulling both the mana and the tainted energy when I activated it, unlike the ordinary meditation that had separated both. </p><p>Admittedly, I wasn’t looking forward to that experiment, but I was in a bit of a pickle. With the night not too far away, keeping hundreds of boxes out to slowly evaporate was too risky. Unfortunately, delaying the class upgrades until morning was no less risky. </p><p>Initially, I had been using the mana from the dungeon to handle the class upgrades, but that was before realizing how dangerously low the mana reserves of the dungeon had gotten. </p><p>I sighed even as I let another glob of tainted energy from the box, but this time, I activated my meditation to draw it to me, ready to stop at any time. </p><p>My new meditation skill was certainly unique. Instead of a rotating sphere relying on the movement to somewhat separate and draw in the mana, it pulled the tainted energy to itself directly. There was a brief clash before the tainted energy had disappeared, devoured by the aura of decay conjured by the skill. </p><p>The process was too fast to truly understand what was going on, but one thing was clear. A tiny amount of mana, probably merely a point’s worth, had just gone into the dungeon through our connection. </p><p>“Fascinating,” I muttered, but then, maybe I shouldn’t have been surprised. Mythic-level skill was something even Maria lacked, and it clearly came with its own advantages. Too bad I couldn’t even begin to understand how it worked. </p><p>However, as much as it rankled my curiosity, I had to admit that the fact it worked was enough. The mythic grade skill not only gave me a direction to handle the fire-natured tainted energy from the lizards, but turned that into mana to refresh the reserves of the dungeon. </p><p>However, the latter would only matter if I could apply that in scale, which was not a given. </p><p>I let one of the boxes open to let increasingly larger pieces of tainted energy out, and activated the skill once again. The larger spheres of tainted energy had been immediately pulled toward me, covered by the aura of decay provided by my skill. </p><p>Soon, I started to see the limits. First, the skill was only able to catch the tainted energy from about three claws at once, and properly breaking down the energy from a solo claw took about a second. Measuring the mana result was harder, but it felt like an ordinary claw gave about fifty points of energy when absorbed.  </p><p>The results were middling. It meant I could facilitate the class upgrade of nine farmers every hour, and gain about just a hundred thousand points of mana in the process. The first part sounded good, but the second part was not as impressive as it first appeared. </p><p>That much mana was barely enough to forge two or three epic spears. </p><p>Once I realized the limits of the skill, I quickly set up a larger leveling room, with several containers that were buried underground to hold the tainted energy and channel back as necessary, intersected by helping the farmers level up. </p><p>It went smoothly. To my surprise, constantly running the meditation skill didn’t exhaust me as I had anticipated, but that might have been about the fact that I followed the suggestion of the skills strictly, without making the slightest change. </p><p>That was an easy temptation to ignore. Blindly modifying Common Meditation had almost killed me. I wasn’t ready to repeat the same adventure with a Mythic skill yet. Not when I doubted that I could survive the process. </p><p>Instead, I focused on helping the farmers class up until darkness fell. As a reward for our efforts, we had twenty Advanced Farmers, currently practicing their newly acquired common spear skill under Harold’s guidance. </p><p>With some little extra assistance from the special weapons I had designed, giving a small edge for the improvement. </p><p>A small edge wasn’t the limit of what I could provide them. I could have easily distributed composite weaponry designed to improve their skills, but I preferred that to stay a secret for some more time. A slight edge could easily be assumed as Harold’s extraordinary competency as a teacher. </p><p>“Be ready, the night is upon us,” I shouted as I watched the sun finally disappear at the horizon, ready to stay outside for a while to both test the monsters, and continue helping the farmers level up. </p><p>However,  the moment the dungeon stopped working, I caught a strong dip in the dungeon’s mana via my connection, which made me fearful before I realized it was being drained to bind the primal form of energy that would eventually turn into mana. </p><p>As I focused, I could feel the energy moving through the dungeon floors, each step modifying the energy somewhat, but the real transformation occurred on the fifth floor, where it had been reduced into its components. </p><p>The absorption speed soon hit a limit, which was likely either due to the capacity of the dungeon entrance, or the dungeon’s ability to handle that much energy at once, but once again, discerning was difficult. </p><p>“How’s the training going, Harold?” I asked. </p><p>“Going well, sir. Soon, we’ll hit the limit of the Common skill, which should allow them to take the Uncommon variant.” </p><p>“Good news, indeed,” I said while focusing on the connection to check the amount of tainted energy in the containers, which was still enough to keep me occupied for an hour. “Make sure they reach at least twenty proficiency before joining the battle.” </p><p>“Will be done, sir,” he said. </p><p>Once that was done, I turned my attention to the outskirts of the mountain, where the lizards had suddenly started to gather in much greater numbers, the remaining foliage that they burned adding an intense brightness to the night.  </p><p>The light allowed me to watch them. This time, they were not only the ordinary variants. </p><p>From a distance, I could see that they didn’t have too much variance when compared to the insects. There were some ranged variants that just spewed fireballs from some range away, with an unknown upper range. Then, there were the flying variants, not to mention a few giant ones, large enough to be seen from afar.</p><p>Luckily, there were no burrowers at the moment, but that didn’t prevent me from adding a metal floor for the plans of the encampment. </p><p>I decided to act when Harold gave me the signal that the training of the first batch had reached a satisfactory level. </p><p>“Be ready for the first wave,” I said as I let one of the containers open, which triggered a small stampede as the monsters that were gathering at the edge of the mountain rushed up. It was dangerous, but ultimately nowhere near as dangerous as letting them gather into one big ball of death. </p><p>And, the extra material would be useful for building the encampments. </p><p>I raised my spear, ready to fight…  </p>",

    "content": "<p>Once I arrived at the fourth floor, I didn’t start working immediately. Instead, I closed my eyes and observed what was going on at the main dungeon gate, examining the battle. </p><p>Harold was back in the mix, leading the team against the hordes. I noted that he was using a spear rather than his sword, which was likely an attempt to hide his most recent skill improvement. I hadn’t asked him to, but I appreciated the initiative nonetheless. </p><p>The last thing I needed was for the other guards to start asking the same for their class skills, something I was reluctant to give before rebellion stopped being an immediate concern. I ignored the temptation to go and help them. </p><p>The nightfall was not too far away, and with it, the escaped dungeon monsters received another boost while getting more aggressive, which had something to do with the energy that the dungeon separated further to create the tainted energy and mana, but I had no idea why the intensity differed between night and day. </p><p>“I wish I could explore that instead of testing Forging,” I said as I prepared the material. I still remembered the pain I felt when my Meditation skills had been improved. I wasn’t looking forward to the second one. </p><p>I pulled one of the equipment I had forged out of dense mana, one with the slightest of blemishes. I took a deep breath before I raised my hammer, brought down the surface, and started to work. </p><p>[-210 Mana]</p><p>[-210 Mana]</p><p>[-210 Mana]</p><p>[Mana Repair (Epic) - 102 -&gt; Mana Repair (Epic) - 103]</p><p>“Alright, that was good.” I examined the repaired equipment, its surface gleaming with no fault. Unlike Meditation, my forging didn’t evolve immediately, which was good news, confirming that it was the unique connection between the Meditation skill and the dungeon that had forced the transformation. </p><p>I repeated the same thing with Mana Forge as well, and even as I held a gleaming spearhead, the skill didn’t transform, which was good. My skill didn’t improve, which wasn’t as good of news, but that part wasn’t a surprise. </p><p>After having raised it to its current level, further development was difficult. </p><p>Once I confirmed that the skill was working as expected, I went back to the entrance, taking another batch of claws to bring them to the lab, forging myself a new set of armor, as well as new weapons, each designed to damage the lizards. </p><p>Admittedly, the quality wasn’t as high as I had hoped, as stabilizing the material for epic-quality equipment without the dungeon crystals was harder than doing the same for ordinary equipment. </p><p>Luckily, the dungeon provided me enough mana to make the process viable. Once I finished them, I forged fifty spearheads and twenty swords, all epic quality. But, I didn’t distribute them immediately. They were to be used in the case of an emergency. </p><p>I didn’t want to stay at that point, but as I started forging the weapons, I started to feel a sense of being overdrawn from the dungeon, which signaled that I might have overdrawn its capacity somewhat. It wasn’t too much of a surprise. </p><p>Even before building that connection, I had been using the dungeon products a lot, from using the shards to mana to aggressively hunting the insects, each costing the dungeon some mana. Then, there was the fact that there were already ten thousand people in the dungeon, aggressively hunting on the first three floors. </p><p>Not to mention, Maria had consumed a truly shocking amount of mana during the short yet memorable defense against the ascended, which was also significant. </p><p>I didn’t know where the limits of the dungeon lay, but I decided to play it safe. The dungeon seemed to use mana as a critical step during the breakdown process, and draining its reserves might have slowed down the renewal.  </p><p>It wasn’t like I could freely arm everyone with epic-quality equipment. My armor was the biggest source of safety, and arming the guards with weapons strong enough to damage it might be a dangerous life choice. </p><p>“No wonder the city lords all rely on Charisma,” I said as I put the handles for the spears. I would like to believe that I wouldn’t have used Charisma to brainwash people even if I possessed it, but it was one temptation I was glad I didn’t have to deal with. </p><p>Once the weapons were forged, I went back to the first floor, carrying the weapons in a sealed box, to be used in case of an emergency. An emergency might occur while the farmers leveled up, which they had been delaying until my order. </p><p>Initially, I had been planning to leave the leveling to tomorrow, but now that my own experimentation had gone smoother than I expected, I could move that forward before nightfall. But, either way, I needed to be there.</p><p>There were several reasons for that. If I was being honest, curiosity was a big part of it. I wanted to be there to observe the process seriously. </p><p>However, that was far from the only reason. Safety was a much more important concern. My own experience with the class upgrade — which felt like ages ago — had shown that monsters reacted to it badly. Admittedly, I didn’t know how much of it was about the class upgrade, and how much of it was due to mana fluctuations which wouldn’t be a problem for us, but either way, it seemed like an idea that was worth taking precautions against. </p><p>Then, there were the more practical concerns, such as how much mana it would take in terms of claws, and what would happen if we released all that tainted energy at once. </p><p>But, above all, I needed to see how the freed tainted energy would act. While my brief experiments had shown that the tainted energy from broken claws had been repelled by the dungeon gate, there was no guarantee that it would react the same way if the tainted energy was from hundreds of claws at once. </p><p>I left the box filled with epic weapons on the first floor, ready to be leveraged in case the lizards reacted worse than I had expected, and stepped into the opening. “Everything  going well?” I asked Harold. </p><p>“Excellent, sir,” he said as he pointed at the huge pile of claws. “The weapons are truly making a difference.” </p><p>“Good. Do you think you can handle the night equally easily?” </p><p>That made his smile fade. “I’m not sure, sir,” he said. “Nighttime can be tricky, especially near a breached dungeon,” he said. “We have the weaponry for it, but it won’t be easy without a proper defensive fort. It  won’t be too bad for the first few nights, but still…”  </p><p>I paused, wondering how long it would take to fashion some walls out of metal that could resist their flame aura. It shouldn’t be too hard. “A portable encampment could be arranged,” I decided. “It won’t hold back truly strong ones, but it should work against the ordinary monsters.”</p><p>With the production line in place, we should have enough to coat the stone walls with metal, which should work as a stopgap measure. </p><p>“That would work, but…” he said as he looked at the farmers at the center of the formation. </p><p>“You need them to upgrade their class,” I said. </p><p>“That would allow them to at least use Common Skills,” he said. “Not to mention, finally having Strength will increase their combat potential significantly.” </p><p>“Don’t worry. I’m here for that,” I said and glanced around, deciding where to place the crusher. In the end, I decided that the edge of the base was the best choice. “Bring the first candidate while I set it up,” I said before walking toward the corner. </p><p>As I walked, I looked toward the horizon, where the sun was about to disappear, and tightened my grip on my new weapons. I hoped that there would be no beast wave, as we were not prepared for it. </p><p>While Harold picked the first candidate, I quickly built the crusher, with two extra rooms. The one that was leveling to step in, so that the structure didn’t waste any mana, while the second had several thick layers to keep the tainted energy in. </p><p>“S-sir, thank you for the opportunity. I won’t disappoint,” the farmer said as he stood in front of me. A man in his thirties, with a weary, yet hopeful face. </p><p>“I know you won’t,” I said, not knowing what to say. I understood his emotions, but finding the appropriate reaction was difficult, especially with the guards watching for the signs of weakness to pounce. “You have Rare Nurture, right?” I asked. He nodded. “What are the class options?” I asked. </p><p>“Advanced farmer only, sir,” he said. </p><p>“Good, step onto the door, and when I tap the door, activate the class upgrade,” I said. He followed my direction, and I activated the crusher and gave the signal. </p><p>Inside the metal room, I could feel the siphoning of the mana easily. I continued to crush the claws in small groups as I watched the perimeter. </p><p>There was no sudden increase in monster attacks, which suggested that the commotion during my leveling was more about the shift in environmental mana than a direct impact. Then, I turned my attention to the tainted energy that had been gathering at the container, which was significantly denser at the side away from the dungeon gate, but as it gathered more, that repelling effect started to work less, showing that increasing density gave them an additional feature. </p><p>An interesting feature, one that I couldn’t experiment with for the moment. </p><p>Instead, I replaced the sealed box once the crushed claws reached a hundred, and continued the process. I had to crush almost four hundred claws before the siphoning had ended. I opened the door, and he stepped out.</p><p>It was more than I had expected, making that class truly an expensive endeavor. Especially since we could move somewhere with atmospheric mana to achieve the same for free. </p><p>But, those thoughts stopped when the farmer stepped out, only to bow at me. </p><p>“Thank you, sir,” he said and bowed. “I promise that I’ll be loyal to you forever.” </p><p>“Just defend your fellow farmers well. That’s all I ask,” I said, feeling self-conscious. I looked at Harold. “Give him a skill, and send in the next one,” I said. “We can handle a few more before nightfall.” </p>",

    "content": "<p>After handing him the key to improve his skill rapidly, I left Harold on the first floor and pulled the cart filled with the claws to the third floor, directly toward the production as I had prepared. </p><p>“Sir,” the blacksmiths greeted me excitedly, standing in front of the production line for the ingots I had asked them to prepare. </p><p>I said nothing as I touched the devices one by one, using Observe to check the production line. “It’s good work, but you missed several spots,” I said and corrected them with bursts of mana, preparing to explain how I fixed them in the process. </p><p>Any other time, I would have pointed out the mistakes and let the students fix them as an educational experience, but with all the potential enemies we had tempted, every second was valuable. I didn’t have the luxury to turn it into the ideal teaching moment. </p><p>“The first thing you need to remember,” I started as they gathered around me, watching intently as I moved from one device to another, taking note of all the mistakes before I decided which part to explain. I preferred to explain every mistake in detail … but once again, I lacked time. “Production lines are all about consistency and precision. It’s a chain that needs to be able to connect without missing a step,” I added. “For example, here,” I said as I used one of the machines to shape the alloys, rapidly creating ten sample alloy bars. “There’s a difference of a tenth of an inch between the thickest and the thinnest of the bars.” </p><p>I could see their hesitation as I explained. I pointed at one of them, provoking him to speak. He looked hesitant to speak, but he still went with it. “Would it make that much of a difference, sir?” he asked. “We’ll still be softening them before using them in our forging.” </p><p>“It wouldn’t necessarily matter that much for the current task, but what about in the future, where we implement automatic steps? Such a discrepancy could ruin the whole batch. It’s a good habit to work on our precision, at least as long as it takes a reasonable amount of time.” </p><p>He nodded, but he didn’t seem particularly convinced. “When we forge by hand, every stroke of the hammer is instinctive under the control of the skill, so making small adjustments is trivial,” I added. “But here?” I gestured toward the machines surrounding us. “We’re relying on mechanisms. That means if something is off by even a fraction, the mistake might ruin the entire batch, wasting material. It might even ruin the machine. And, with the enemy approaching fast, we don’t have the luxury to waste time,” I said. </p><p>Another nod, this time far more honest. I could see that the explanation had worked. I itched to ask a few questions to make sure he got the correct point, but after a momentary consideration, I decided against it. We didn’t have time for a debate at the moment. Maybe in the future. </p><p>Instead, I moved to the core smelter, which was far larger than the blast furnaces I had, ready to operate. But, I frowned as I traced the pipes that existed to feed the mana to the core of the crusher. “Look here,” I said and pointed at the pipe. “There’s a tiny crack here.” </p><p>The crack itself was barely visible on the surface, but it warped the layers of internal structure, which was a considerably bigger issue. </p><p>They all turned toward another blacksmith, who had a shocked expression on his face. “I made sure to install it perfectly, sir,” he said panickedly. </p><p>“Maybe, but did you check it once it cooled down properly?” I asked. He shook his head hesitantly, though he wasn’t the only one that had the expression. I sighed. “This is a composite material,” I explained. “They are far more fragile than the weapons you create based on System recipes. You can’t just let them be after quenching and hope they don’t warp. You need to check them regularly for damage and warping.” </p><p>They looked hesitant, and a touch rebellious as well. But, they lacked the confidence to ask questions. </p><p>I sighed as I decided to explain it despite my hurry. Considering the work I wanted them to do, the last thing I wanted was for them to be afraid of asking questions. “A crack like that would have been trivial if we were working with liquids, but it’ll let mana leak more than you think.  This tiny crack alone would probably reduce the mana efficiency by ten percent.” </p><p>This time, nods were more emphatic, but their fear was equally intense, particularly the one that made the mistake. I sighed. “I’m not angry or disappointed. Just be careful next time,” I said. “Now, that’s enough checking. I’m going to start creating the metal. Gather all the apprentices to help with the forging.” </p><p>“All of them, sir?” one of them asked. </p><p>“Yes. We are going to create at least ten thousand sets of armor and weapons, not to mention arrows and other consumables.” </p><p>With that, some went to gather, while others stayed with me to help with the set-up. </p><p>Admittedly, the structure was not too complicated. Instead of the blast furnace relying on the natural airflow, we had steam-powered pumps to send high-pressure air to the fires, reaching a degree that could liquify several tons of metal at once. </p><p>Then, there were multiple crucibles to melt the metal, so that we didn’t have to wait. The apprentice blacksmiths dealt with the preparations, which allowed me to focus on imbuing the molten metal with the energy from the claws, and then move the material to the casts to turn them into industrial bars. </p><p>If we had the dungeon crystals to assist the stabilization, processing the required metal would have cost me merely minutes. Unfortunately, without them, the same process would probably extend to three to four hours, maybe even longer if there was an inconvenient accident. </p><p>However, the moment the casts cooled down, my work was over. I didn’t even remove the ingots from their casts, leaving it to apprentices, focusing on the two steps that I couldn’t outsource. The apprentices with the blacksmith skills gathered at the other end of the production line, and the sound of hammers filled the opening. </p><p>It was loud, but also comforting. It was better than working alone. </p><p>Despite the urgency of the task, I took a break every ten minutes, walking among the workers, fixing the most egregious mistakes I caught. “No. You need to heat up the metal more, or you’ll waste too much time,” I corrected one of the farmers, speaking louder than necessary to let the others hear as well. </p><p>“B-but, the skill —” he started. </p><p>“I know what the skill says, but you don’t have the prerequisite Strength to deal with it quickly,” I said. “That way of dealing assumes a certain support you won’t have until you upgrade your class. Heat up the metal more to hasten the process,” Unfortunately, this was the case. Temporarily, the farmer volunteers were limited in their efficiency. </p><p>Of course, the limited efficiency was relative to my new understanding. Compared to my capabilities back when I was still in the town, they were considerably better. Their Basic skill was already at twenty-five points of proficiency, and they had much better equipment than I had been limited to. That combination already gave them a significant advantage. </p><p>He followed the directions as I explained, only to frown. “I feel like the metal will be too weak if I continue like this,” he said. </p><p>“Yes, but that’s not a big disadvantage,” I explained. “This type of arrow is designed to target the larger lizards. If they shatter after penetration, it’ll only make the wound deadlier,” I explained. “You just need to reinforce the tip slightly to make sure it’s strong enough to penetrate through their scales.” </p><p>He nodded thoughtfully. A glance confirmed that he was not the only one sharing that expression, showing the effectiveness of my impromptu lesson. I continued walking around and fixing the most obvious mistakes, giving some tips, and even making sure to compliment particularly creative ideas. </p><p>Hopefully, it would show them that I valued creativity above rote repetition of what their skill was suggesting. </p><p>It was not the most ideal way of educating them, which I knew well as a career professor. But then again, it was far from the only topic I was taking shortcuts around, which unfortunately was inevitable due to the circumstances. Impromptu teaching sessions had slowed down the progress somewhat, but looking at the speed they worked, I concluded it to be an acceptable sacrifice. </p><p>Five hours later, I was looking at a pile of gleaming ingots of various sizes, only a fraction had turned into weapons. The amount of raw material should keep them busy for three days at a minimum, arming everyone in the process. </p><p>“Continue with your forging tasks. Our safety relies on you,” I ordered once I finished with my part. As much as I wanted to stay and guide them, I had something more important to address. </p><p>To see if my epic forging was working properly… </p>",

    "content": "<p>I said nothing until l opened another gate back to the first floor. Harold led the team he had collected for me. Six hundred people in total; a hundred guards, supported by five hundred Farmers. </p><p>“How are we going to handle the class upgrade, sir?” Harold asked me as we watched the rest of the team arrive. </p><p>“We’re just going to use the Mana from the claws for the first one, then revisit,” I said. I had multiple concerns relating to how the dungeon operated still, but one thing I wanted to do was to limit mana spending if possible. </p><p>Yes, the dungeon created mana, but before I could get a better understanding of its actual limits, lowering the consumption was a better idea. An easy decision to handle when I had an alternative delivery method that brought themselves to my feet. </p><p>Harold nodded. “It feels weird to destroy all of them rather than sell,” he admitted with a sigh. “I have no idea how much money the claws would go for, but I’m sure it’ll be a fortune. Those will be the most expensive class upgrades for Farmers in history.” </p><p>“We need to stay alive to spend the money,” I said. It was easy to dismiss the financial ramifications when we lacked an opportunity to actually use it for our benefit. </p><p>Then, while Harold was busy assigning the weapons, I went back to the workshop to quickly fashion two hundred containers. The mechanics of it were simple. A button to compress the metal to crush the shell inside the box, while the walls of the box had been optimized to separate mana and the tainted energy. All they needed was to press and throw. </p><p>While they put on the equipment, I created some fragmentation boxes for them, which should be enough for a while. </p><p>“Ready?” I asked once I arrived. </p><p>“Yes, sir,” Harold replied. “The first team, ready!” he ordered, and two hundred people split from the crowd, predominantly the guards. The others also lined up, ready to follow. </p><p>They looked around at the broken fortifications — demolished by the ascended warriors during their initial approach — before Harold shouted. “Attention!” </p><p>“Dealing with the lizards is not too hard, at least for the moment,” I shouted. “They are more agile than the insects, but they lack their defense. Shooting at them from range shouldn’t be too hard as long as ranged attacks are used in waves. As for drawing them closer, watch me carefully,” I ordered. </p><p>Then, I repeated the earlier trick, using four boxes to draw them to a reasonable distance before I moved forward and dealt with them. While dealing with them, I made sure to dodge their attacks for a while to give them a chance to observe the attacks. </p><p>However, once the number of lizards had dropped to half, I shifted to my sword. Behind me, I could already see the guards watching me, disdain creeping to their faces. I would have found their rapid loss of respect weird considering my earlier display of dominance, but with my suspicions about the System, I decided to treat it as a constant hostility. </p><p>I just needed to show off constantly to remind them of my power. </p><p>I smirked as I let the mana gather around my sword, amused by the ironic familiarity of the situation. Back before Cataclysm, I had to deal with many professors who assumed their age somehow made them better than me, meaning the only way to keep them reasonable was to constantly remind them I was better than them. </p><p>At least, I had the tools to make it easy. </p><p>Instead of letting the mana attack go at once, I gathered it until it had been gathered thick enough to gain an intense glow, and then let it out as one ranged slash, killing all that remained. “I think that’s enough to teach you the movement patterns,” I said in a casual voice, like it was just a casual attack, not something I pushed myself to do. </p><p>But, seeing the disdain replaced with a healthy dose of respect and awe, I was happy with the subterfuge. </p><p>“It better have been, sir,” Harold said, quick to catch up. </p><p>“Good, then the command is yours,” I said as I went back into the dungeon. I wanted to stay and watch, but the way the expressions of most of the guards had changed convinced me that it was not a good idea. </p><p>Naturally, I still stayed near the entrance, watching them through the dungeon connection, ready to intervene in case of an emergency. Harold proved himself to be a capable commander, and I trusted him to handle the situation, but with all the unknowns we had been dealing with, it was still a challenge. </p><p>But, just because I was on standby didn’t mean I was wasting my time. I spent the time writing a treatise on how to develop mana variants of the skills, which included a combination of my own experiences and Eleanor’s attempts. </p><p>Luckily, the fact that the dungeon produced Basic Meditation, which could be absorbed without any precondition, should help people get used to the concept of mana more easily. A few specially-designed devices from my side to support their skills, and having a small cadre of mana-capable people was not out of the question. </p><p>But, as I completed the booklet, I realized that it was not the best idea. </p><p>“I can’t hurry up,” I muttered as I watched the guards and farmers battle against the monsters, the gap between the classes clear even when fighting a common enemy. </p><p>We were isolated, away from any major population centers, constantly being assaulted by hordes of monsters that would inevitably grow further. Our situation was already complicated enough, then there were other variables, such as the potentially brainwashing powers of the System, and my hasty decision to rekindle modern technology in the form of industrial production. </p><p>A critical variable like widespread mana usage could wait a few days, especially since, ultimately, mana was still a restricted resource. It did feel like a limitless resource as long as I was the only one who constantly used it, but I doubt it would be the same when we had hundreds of users … let alone thousands. </p><p>But, there was still one critical question. What to do with Meditation. With the monsters starting to drop that skill, I doubted that I could exert any meaningful amount of control unless I integrated a police-state level control that would have made Stalin jealous. </p><p>I sighed and decided to let that be. Letting people experiment instead of trying to control was the better idea. I doubted that without my guidance, there would be hundreds of people, mostly due to people’s attitude toward experimenting. </p><p>I hoped that I wouldn’t underestimate people since, if I was wrong, I would be dealing with the consequences directly. I folded the notes to keep them in a corrosion-resistant box and brought them to the fourth floor before I returned to the first floor. </p><p>After ten waves, Harold returned to the dungeon, bringing a cart full of claws, enough to arm every single occupant of the dungeon with weaponry that could deal extra damage against the lizards.  </p><p>“Here they are, sir,” he said before launching a report of what had happened. I had watched it, but I still let him deliver the detailed report, as it was a good habit. </p><p>Meanwhile, I quickly sorted the claws, making plans for the next step.</p><p>I had to admit, that the ability to assign hundreds of people to the task rather than doing every single step myself was certainly liberating. The cart was filled to the brim with claws, and alone, it would have taken me at least a day to collect that amount. And, even more to process and turn them into weapons, which was another chore I didn’t have to deal with. Not with hundreds of apprentices I acquired, each enthusiastic to put their newest skill to use. I just needed to turn them into ingots, and the rest would be handled by them. </p><p>Of course, arming everyone was just the beginning. While the number of claws that I possessed was enough to arm everyone, it was only true when the weapons in question were limited to medieval tech. </p><p>“Excellent work,” I said. </p><p>“Thank you, sir,” he said happily. I was glad that, unlike the other guards, he wasn’t showing any sign of disdain toward me. </p><p>“I think I promised you a reward,” I said. He nodded, trying to hide his enthusiasm, but failing. I passed him a sword, connected with a chain so I could check his skill in detail. “Use every attack your skill has,” I said as I closed my eyes, glad that his class skill was a sword art. </p><p>Thanks to Eleanor, I was familiar with the variations of it. Even without his explanation, I could see that it was a Rare skill, probably just below a hundred in proficiency. It was a more balanced style, relying on Strength and Dexterity in equal amounts. It only had one Vitality attack, one with no special features. </p><p>Designing a composite sword to follow the attack path to supercharge the skill growth took me less than a minute. “Try to keep this sword hidden,” I said as I passed it to him. </p><p>He used it once, using a Vitality attack, only for his eyes to widen. He swung again, the smoothness of the attack showing a marked improvement. Then again. “Good, it’s working. Come talk with me once the growth slows down,” I said and opened a gate to the third floor. </p><p>I still needed to create enough weapons to keep the dungeon safe before I experimented with my epic forging properly. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Repeating the trick with the fragmenting container, I drew another batch of lizards toward the entrance, which had been simple enough. I killed them all, but the weakest one, which I wrapped with a chain, and started dragging it toward the dungeon gate. </p><p>The more I dragged it toward the gate, the more it reacted in agitation, but ultimately, I was able to drag it to the entrance. The moment it touched the gate, the lizard started thrashing even more, but the chains were able to keep it immobile. </p><p>To my surprise, it was able to enter the dungeon, but I felt the dungeon lashing against its presence. The lizard started to act weak and listless in the presence of the dungeon mist. It looked harmless, but using the chains as a medium to use Observe, I could see that it actively consumed the dungeon mist to affect the lizard-like. </p><p>“Damn,” I said as I killed the lizard, but left the claws on, watching the mist slowly attack the body. A minute later, it disappeared just like an insect's body. Visually, there was no difference between that and the way the insects disappeared, which was probably why Maria approved the strategy to get inside. </p><p>From her perspective, even if the monster density reached a point that they were willing to enter inside, dealing with them would have been much easier. So, in the brief time before her departure, she focused on more important topics. </p><p>The reality differed. Admittedly, the difference was slight, enough that I doubted that I would have looked for it had my connection with the dungeon not given me a new perspective about how it functioned. </p><p>When the insects had been killed, the mist decomposed them back into their magical entity, returning to the dungeon to create more monsters. That way, the dungeon continued to provide more monsters efficiently. </p><p>Of course, that also meant that constantly bringing the shells or other materials outside to sell was a good way to weaken the dungeon. Whether that was intentional or not was another question, but not an urgent one. </p><p>I was more concerned about the implications of letting the lizards enter the dungeon. The more lizards entered the dungeon, the weaker the dungeon would get. Considering how critical the mana from the dungeon was— both coming from the shells, and through my direct connection to it — letting it weaken would be a bad idea. </p><p>“But, there’s the issue of my connection with the dungeon,” I growled. With that, I didn’t know if it was better to make the dungeon stronger, or weaker. I sighed. At least, if I decided to do the former, I had a method. Just import cheap dungeon products from other dungeons break them inside, and let two different types of tainted energy neutralize each other. </p><p>Another thing for the future. </p><p>“I need to figure out a better way to defend the dungeon,” I muttered, frustrated. The whole idea was to keep everyone inside, and whenever there was a significant attack, temporarily switch the dungeon entrance to the fifth floor to use the corrosive land.</p><p>It had been a simple yet effective strategy that gave me the confidence to handle the situation in their absence. Unfortunately, it turned out that the fundamental assumption we based that strategy was faulty. </p><p>I sighed as I piled the claws I had extracted, bringing them to the first-floor workshop. A gate to the fourth floor to pick some extra ingots, and I rapidly turned them into another set of weapons, predominantly spears, but I also forged a thousand arrowheads to give our troops a ranged option. </p><p>They weren’t very good weapons, but they were workable.  </p><p>As for creating Epic quality weapons, I didn’t dare to yet, still afraid of an adverse reaction. </p><p>Only after I finished turning the second batch of claws into weapons, I opened another gate to the third floor, this time directly to the base. I glanced around, happy to notice that there was a second mine that was already being dug. It was a good show of initiative. </p><p>Harold approached me the moment I appeared. “How’s it going?” I asked Harold. </p><p>“We have discovered a second mine, sir, and the production line is updated as you asked. Currently, we produce about fifty tons of iron every hour, but we expect to triple it once the rails connect with it,” he added. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said. “How did you discover it?” </p><p>“It was Terry, sir,” he said, pointing toward the young man who was at the center of the group. “He managed to use the roots of the trees to explore the area and discover a mineral deposit.” </p><p>“That’s good,” I said, and listened to the rest of the report, which had nothing particularly unexpected. While he was going on through the report, I paid closer attention to the crowd, trying to see if there was anything problematic about the situation. </p><p>There was not. </p><p>“Excellent work,” I said, then looked around. “I need a team back on the first floor to hunt the fire lizards to keep their numbers low,” I said. </p><p>“Should I mobilize the guards, sir?” he asked. </p><p>“Not all of them,” I replied. “Make sure it’s a mixture of the guards and the farmers that want to upgrade their class. Prioritize the ones that had to use Skill stones to upgrade their class skill,” I added. While I was yet to identify the reason for people’s inability to upgrade their skills naturally, assuming the same variable had played a role in upgrading to the mana variant was a reasonable guess, fitting to Occam’s Razor Principle. </p><p>If one had two competing ideas to explain the same phenomenon, the simpler one was preferable. </p><p>Of course, it didn’t necessarily mean that the simpler explanation was the correct one, which was why Occam’s Razor should be used to pick a sequence to test various theories rather than pick the simpler one like I was doing. The history of the world was filled with dangerous misunderstandings based on trying to use it like I was doing. </p><p>Unfortunately, with the situation forcing my hand from many different directions, I didn’t have the luxury of making optimal decisions.  </p><p>”Are we sure, sir?” Harold asked, interrupting my thoughts. “It won’t be safe to hunt the lizards. I have seen them from a distance, and they are quite mobile. I’m not sure the farmers could handle them. We can’t risk their lives.”</p><p>I smiled, realizing that he misunderstood the source of reluctance. </p><p>“Don’t worry, the team doesn't have to get away from the dungeon gate. As long as they stay next to the gate, behind the fortifications we’re about to build, the risk would be minimal. Then, they can just limit themselves to ranged weapons until we upgrade their classes,” I said. </p><p>“Really, sir,?” he asked, then paused. “Has the number increased that much already,” he added. </p><p>I sighed. His response made it clear that the way the dungeon monsters reacted to other dungeons was another common knowledge I had missed. </p><p>“I have a way to bring the lizards closer to the dungeon. Just arrange the team. The rest will be easy,” I promised. </p><p>He nodded, accepting my conclusion. I was glad that, apart from hiding my class, I didn’t give any reason for him to not trust me. “I’ll lead them personally, sir,” he promised. </p><p>“No. Pick someone you trust to lead that team. You have a different task,” I said. </p><p>He looked around. “You’re right, sir. I need to stay here and make sure everything goes well.” </p><p>“Not that,” I said. “With Eleanor gone, I need someone that I can trust to hold the front line. So, we’re going to make sure you are suitably equipped for the task, including the appropriate external skills.” </p><p>He sighed. “I hate to admit, but I’m not exactly a fast learner when it comes to combat, sir,” he said. </p><p>I couldn’t help but smirk. “Don’t worry about it. That won’t be as big of a problem as you think it would be,” I said. “Just focus on collecting the team. I need them to start hunting so that I can automate the production of the equipment,” I said. </p><p>While Harold arranged that, I went toward the blast furnaces. “Every Blacksmith has already upgraded their skill to uncommon, sir,” he declared. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said. “How about the apprentices?” </p><p>“They have already reached the limit of their external skills and are ready to work, sir,” he added, then paused. “Many farmers also want to join the team. Should we allow them?” </p><p>“Go ahead, but keep it limited to three hundred for the moment,” I said, both surprised and impressed by the efficiency the things had been moving forward with. But then, maybe I shouldn’t have been. I was alone, yet it merely took days for me to create a primitive workflow that allowed me to refine several tons of iron every day. Here, not only did they have the equipment I created to copy, but they also had the cooperation of hundreds of people. </p><p>No wonder it was impressive. I threw him an ingot. “What’s this, sir? It feels more volatile, almost like it can shatter with a hit.” </p><p>“That’s the point,” I said. “It’s an alloy against the lizards, ready to shatter against their skin. I want you to try and make arrowheads from it.” </p><p>He nodded, and a minute later, I was looking at a dozen arrowheads. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said. Admittedly, I didn’t need their assistance to make arrowheads, as that was easy to standardize, but it felt like a good point to start. “Now, what I want from you is to build a production line like this…” I said as I quickly drew a structure, which would allow me to quickly turn thousands of claws to mana ingots in quick order. </p><p>That way, I didn’t have to spend all my time creating armor and other equipment. I could just create the ingots in bulk, while our team of blacksmiths would handle the rest. </p><p>“It’ll be done, sir,” he promised. </p><p>Once that was done, I returned to the team that had been collected by Harold. </p><p>I had a defense to plan. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Soon, I was on the first floor, which was currently empty, leaving the team on the third floor to operate alone. While it was a risk to leave them unattended, it was nowhere near enough to let them fight against an unknown threat without my presence. The guards weren’t exactly strong, especially since we hadn’t trained them through the new methods properly. </p><p>However, even with my control, I wasn’t sure whether to train them to their full capability yet. I had a strong strategic advantage granted by the dungeon, especially my new ability to open temporary gates between floors. Together with my vision range and other advantages, I was confident to keep things in control in the dungeon, but I was still reluctant to fully commit to it.</p><p>Trying to control a hundred guards, each with a developed Epic skill seemed too dangerous to risk. </p><p>“I can decide that later,” I muttered as I stopped at the hill where we had the experimental products. The metal there wasn’t good enough to make a good replacement for my armor, but that didn’t mean I couldn’t fashion a chainmail I could wear above mine. </p><p>It was clunkier than I would have liked, but I didn’t want to go out without the ability to block their fire effect that could bypass armor. I also fashioned a spear from the remaining metal, which seemed like the best weapon to have against them. </p><p>I didn’t expect the first wave of monsters to be a challenge for me, but that wasn’t a good reason to be unprepared. </p><p>“Now, let’s see how far away from the dungeon I can move,” I muttered as I stepped out of the gate, looking at the burning landscape. </p><p>It was a pity. Just yesterday, the hills and plains that surrounded the town were a beautiful green, but now it had turned into a red and black-landscape. The presence of the lizards had been enough to turn the area into a mess. </p><p>Once I was a hundred yards away from the dungeon, I used a mana attack, depleting my mana. </p><p>[-210 Mana]</p><p>It was filled back, but it wasn’t instant like it was in the dungeon. It took a fraction of a second to refill, but still, the distance was clear. I moved another hundred yards away from the dungeon gate and repeated the effort, only for it to slow down even more, but it still stayed well below a second. </p><p>“It’s not too bad,” I growled as I kept moving farther away from the gate, carefully splitting my attention between my surroundings and the connection. I didn’t know if suddenly getting ambushed or snapping the connection would be worse, but I wasn’t in a position to test that. </p><p>Nor did I want to. Instead, I focused on the connection I had, trying to focus on the sensation of opening another gate, one that I knew to be possible from my earlier encounter in the volcanic dungeon. The sensation was hard to describe, but I could feel that, if I gave a push, I could open a gate. But, the effort that was required felt more significant than just opening a floor between the dungeon floors.  </p><p>“Nice to know,” I said, but I didn’t continue with it, not willing to exhaust myself. </p><p>Instead, I focused on my task. I didn’t move down too much, merely five hundred yards away from the dungeon, a distance where the sensation of stretching was already turning out to be uncomfortable. </p><p>I ignored that and pulled a small crusher I had brought and demolished a few shells from the monsters, separating mana from the shells before I opened the box, trying to bait the nearest lizards toward me. </p><p>I needed that since, even though they crowded the outskirts of the mountain, they weren’t climbing quickly. </p><p>The trick didn’t work, but due to an unexpected reason. The dungeon gate pulled the tainted energy back inside, with a stronger velocity than I had expected. </p><p>I reduced the distance to half, and repeated the trick, watching the strength of the pull, which seemed to double. “A linear relationship, not the hardest to beat,” I said as I moved back to the earlier spot, fashioned a new box with a deliberately fragile shell, and once I trapped the tainted energy inside, I threw the box as far as I could manage. </p><p>Strength allowed me to throw it high, and the fact that the dungeon gate was on the top of the mountain made it even easier. </p><p>The fragmentation spread the energy even more, and the monsters reacted to the presence of tainted energy by rushing to the point of impact, their hiss of fury loud. I expected only the lizards nearest to the effect to rush toward the tainted energy, as I had a good idea about the general distance of the taunt effect. </p><p>To my surprise, fire lizards reacted to the tainted energy more intensely than I had expected. “Maybe it’s the change they had when dying outside,” I said. My general dungeon lore was limited, but it was well-known that the dungeon beasts that died outside didn’t disappear the same way, and showed far more aggression. </p><p>It was absurd to think that the change would be limited to just that. </p><p>I threw a few more fragment containers to drive them closer and closer, expecting them to rush toward me. To my surprise, once they reached a certain distance to the dungeon, they stopped their approach, suddenly showing signs of fear and anger — as much as a group of weird lizards could show it. </p><p>I examined their behavior, frowning. Technically, their avoidance was good news. I hoped that they would continue to avoid the dungeon entrance, but I wasn’t sure. The way they acted reminded me of how the giant insects reacted to the trees, only at a wider range. But this also meant that they might end up ignoring their fear once their numbers got high enough, the same way the insects ignored the presence of the trees.</p><p>If that was the case, I needed to be prepared. </p><p>Luckily, it was an easy test to conduct. I created several more containers and baited more and more lizards, turning their group into a horde. As their numbers increased, they moved closer to the gate, but didn’t get daring enough to rush forward. </p><p>I used my new spear to cut through them. Since the lizards were the weakest variant, their defeat came with ease. One blow, particularly from the metal forged from their materials, was enough to demolish them with ease. </p><p>But, while fighting, they didn’t start running away despite their numbers being reduced. </p><p>“Good news,” I said as I finished killing them. While I didn’t need that particular advantage against the weak lizards, the dungeon had thousands of people who didn’t have that luxury. Not to mention, I would still welcome that advantage against the boss monsters. </p><p>There were about three hundred lizards that were outside the dungeon, which had been easy to demolish. I quickly cut their claws while leaving the rest on the ground, and returned to the dungeon with them. </p><p>Once at the dungeon, I used a temporary gate to go to the third floor for a quick check, but I deliberately targeted a hill half a mile away from the newly built forge complex. I wanted to check the situation without showing myself. </p><p>Things were going better than I had expected. The first set of apprentices were already working at the forges, some forging daggers from mana alloys while others worked on creating railways, while a bigger crowd was already laying tracks between the mine and the forge. </p><p>The situation seemed to be in order, so I went back to the first floor. The experiments with Maria were useful, as I was able to turn the claws into weapons and armor rapidly enough, enough to arm thirty people. Not an army, but enough to hunt for more lizards as a team. </p><p>But, I didn’t use all of the claws during forging. I kept one, and demolished it in a crusher. Then, I used advanced Observe to see what would happen. Something about the reaction of the lizards had alarmed me, and I wanted to see if my vague worries had any basis. I hoped that I was just being needlessly cautious, as I already had too many projects to deal with. </p><p>It turned out that I was not, and my worries were more accurate than I had hoped.  </p><p>If it was a shell I had demolished, the mana would have been absorbed back by the dungeon rapidly, while the tainted energy would follow the same path, only slower. </p><p>The mana acted as I expected and was absorbed by the dungeon. The tainted energy … not so much. </p><p>Instead of slowly slipping out to be absorbed, it started a silent conflict at the edge of the box. The speed of it wasn’t high, nor was the process showy, but the dungeon mist … fought against the taint, destroying it slowly while spending itself. </p><p>“That’s not good,” I said with a frown. I might have been happier if it had been earlier, before my connection with the dungeon gave me a better sense of its internal process, showing that both the mist and the tainted energy were critical parts of the dungeon's operation. </p><p>The reaction between the different dungeons showed that their energies were not compatible, so the situation was even worse. It meant that we couldn’t ignore the lizards that were outside. Eventually, they would climb the mountain and attack the gate. </p><p>And, I had a feeling that I wouldn’t appreciate their presence inside the dungeon. This meant, I needed to put a defensive line outside, which would create significant defensive vulnerabilities…</p><p>Unless, of course, I could find a way to isolate the lizards once they stepped into the dungeon.  </p><p>I sighed in exhaustion before I went out to draw another group of lizards to attack the dungeon. This needed further experimentation. </p><p>Like I didn’t have enough problems. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Silence ruled at the declaration before Terry raised his hand. I appreciated his initiative. “Is it open for the farmers as well, sir?” he asked. </p><p>“Of course,” I replied, then looked at the guards as well. “Farmers, guards, the other classes … anyone that’s willing.” </p><p>“What about the lack of Strength?” Terry asked. “We can’t even learn the common variant without it.” </p><p>“You can still learn the Basic variant, so it’s not a problem,” I replied. I thought about making a comment on Meditation as well, but I held back, not wanting to confuse things. Eleanor’s success with upgrading her sword skill to the Mana variant was promising, but it wasn’t something that we could leverage in a few minutes. </p><p>I could see many people looking thoughtful, including a few guards, which surprised me. It looked like my beatdown gave them the wrong impression when it came to Forge skill, but I let that particular point go untouched. Any explanation would make my point weaker. </p><p>And, it wasn’t like having Forge or Repair skills was terrible. As my own experience had shown, they had significant advantages on the battlefield, from rapidly creating traps to actually identifying weaknesses of the enemy weapons. </p><p>“I will give you a moment to think,” I said, then waved my hand, creating another temporary gate, this time to my fourth-floor base, and filled multiple carts with excess available metal and ore, and I even loaded one of the blast furnaces to the carts before I transported them back to the third floor. </p><p>They watched in silence as I rapidly set up a small production line, the combination of my Strength and unlimited mana making it even faster. Soon, I was forging mana swords made of mana steel without using the denser Epic mana. </p><p>With the unlimited mana from the dungeon, it merely took a minute for me to finish forging fifty swords, bypassing most steps with mana. “Anyone that lost their weapon can take one,” I said. </p><p>The guards approached reluctantly, no doubt expecting to receive inferior copies, only for their expression to twist in shock once they tried. “S-sir, this is much better than what we had before,” several of them gasped in shock. </p><p>“And, you’ll receive far better weapons once you prove yourself,” I promised. It was an easy one to fulfill. I turned around. “Now, again, a hundred volunteers at first,” I declared. </p><p>This time, thousands of hands rose, not just from the farmers, but also from the guards. Meanwhile, the auxiliary workers all raised their hands, while the blacksmiths looked shocked. “Much better,” I said with a booming voice. “Everyone that wants will have their chance, but for the moment, we only want a hundred volunteers,” I said. “Arrange a lottery for the first candidates,” I said </p><p>Most hands went down, but one hand, belonging to one of the guards, stayed up. “Ask away,” I said. </p><p>“Sir, I don’t understand why you need us,” he said. “You can already arm everyone alone, and it wouldn’t take a day.” </p><p>“True, if we’re speaking of swords,” I said. He looked hesitant. “You’re about to say that axes and hammers should have a comparable time, even full plate armors should take less than a week,” I added. He nodded, looking even more confused. “Can’t you imagine having better weapons?” I said. </p><p>“Ballistas?” he said hesitantly. </p><p>“What about cannons? Tanks? Planes? Warships?” I asked, each repeat making him look even more shocked. It was clear that they were happy to limit themselves to the offerings of the System, and the idea itself was shocking. </p><p>Not just for him, but for everyone. </p><p>I was barely able to hold back from letting out a derisive laugh. They were accepting my words with little to no resistance, but it had nothing to do with the actual viability of the idea, and everything to do with the authority I had established by beating them. If it wasn’t for my previous display, I could have made the same pitch for days, only to be refused. </p><p>I was speaking from experience. I had been laughed out for far more reasonable ideas. The sheer temerity of modifying the suggestion from the skills during the repair had been enough. </p><p>I felt like one of the billionaire entrepreneurs back before the System, my ideas were treated as genius regardless of their actual viability. The excitement that spread through the crowd was palpable. </p><p>While Harold dealt with the lottery, I walked toward Terry. “I need you to do something for me,” I said. </p><p>“Yes, sir,” he said. </p><p>“Organize the farmers with at least Rare Nurture skill. I need you to work on modifying the trees to create a material that is close to plastic.” </p><p>He looked hesitant. “I’m not sure I know how, sir,” he admitted, still hesitant to talk with me. </p><p>“Experiment, and make sure to write down every process you use,” I said. “I promise I’ll do my best to help if you can’t come up with a solution in a day or two.” </p><p>“Yes, sir,” he said. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said as I walked away, happy that I could simply give orders with ease. Before making another move, I closed my eyes, checking the exterior of the dungeon, trying to guess how much time we had before the monsters were at the entrance. </p><p>We still had several hours, which might as well be an eternity when the situation was considered. Then, while Harold dealt with the lottery, I focused on my next task: searching for mining opportunities. “Let’s see if it works,” I muttered as I closed my eyes, trying to use the connection to discover the locations. </p><p>Unfortunately, there was no convenient map of every metal deposit that came from the connection, meaning I had to rely on the old method of using the pole with the gap in the middle. It didn’t take long for me to find an iron deposit with around ten percent purity, which was enough for the current purpose. I slammed my hammer several times, happy to use my unrestricted mana to turn the area into an open field mine that they could simply fill the carts at and bring them back. </p><p>The third floor wasn’t as rich as the fourth floor when it came to metals, but the deposit I discovered should be sufficient to teach them while creating the necessary armament. </p><p>I grew a line of trees on the way back to show the direction. When I returned, Harold was standing in front of the group of one hundred that were dealing with the aftermath of the skill stone.  At some distance away, Terry was leading a team of farmers in their efforts to modify the trees to create a product similar to rubber or plastic. </p><p>“These are the first set of volunteers,” I asked. </p><p>“Yes, sir,” he said. “They are the lucky ones.” </p><p>“Excellent. I have discovered a mine for iron ore. Arrange a team to load them onto the carts and bring them back,” I asked, then looked at the ten Blacksmiths that Maria had managed to hire before things had turned into a mess. “Why don’t you help me set up a proper production line while they absorb their new skills properly,” I said. </p><p>“Yes, sir,” they said in tandem, their fervor a bit too religious for my liking, but I didn’t say anything. It wasn’t uncommon for people to feel a sense of unity with the members of their own Class, not too unlike people traveling internationally feeling closer to people of the same hometown despite not knowing them. </p><p>The fact that I achieved all of it as a Blacksmith explained the way they looked. </p><p>“The first thing we’re going to do is set up a blast furnace, create an automated feeder line, and connect it to a line of output, allowing us to create a constant flow of molten iron ...” I started, giving them a quick breakdown of the process. Following that, I showed them how to create a blast furnace, a steam engine, and the connectors, which was easy with the example in front of them. </p><p>Especially since, for once, no one argued about the products not being exactly to the System’s specifications. It was convenient, but annoying at the same time. I preferred an inquisitive approach rather than the abject worship they were displaying.</p><p>While they were in place, I rapidly turned the newly created iron into mana alloys in bulk, not working hard to make them particularly high quality, prioritizing speed. They were essentially low-quality consumables that would allow them to quickly raise their skill level before we started doing something more practical. </p><p>“Start with daggers,” I recommended as I put together a long list of instructions, from the ideal temperature to start working on the daggers to folding and quenching patterns. “And, once you feel that your skill has hit a limit, use the casts like I had shown, and start forging railroads. We need to be able to move a lot of ore to keep all those blast furnaces busy. And, don’t forget to show the new recruits the ropes. I want all of them at the peak of their external skills when I return, and I want you to reach at least Uncommon. Understood?” </p><p>“You won’t be here, sir?” one of the blacksmiths asked. </p><p>“No, I have other things to handle for the next hour or two,” I replied. </p><p>Things such as hunting enough lizards to forge fire-resistant armor and extra effective ammunition before the bosses arrived. </p><p>Once I delivered the instructions, I went to find Harold, and explained what I had in mind. “Do you want me to come with you, sir?” he asked. </p><p>“No. I want you to stay here and keep an eye on things just in case,” I said. For the next experiment I had in mind, I needed to be alone. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Soon, I was standing before the residents of the dungeon, split into four distinct groups. The most crowded group was the farmers, more than seven thousand of them, pushing together tightly, understandably looking tense. </p><p>It had only been hours since they were evacuated, and they hadn’t received a proper explanation other than it being a monster wave. </p><p>The second group was the guards, with Harold strategically positioned in front of them, seeming ready to support me. I wasn’t afraid of a double-cross. Technically, it was a great departure from my hesitancy to trust people. I would have loved to say that I had learned to trust people more. </p><p>Harold had been the highest-ranking guard for less than an hour, which was one of the things Eleanor and Maria arranged before their departure, and with his track record, I could leave the dungeon operations to him confidently. </p><p>Though, if I was being honest, it was easy to be trusting when one had the advantage in power. Even without the unlimited mana from the dungeon, and the decay attack, I was confident that I could take down all the guards single-handedly. </p><p>The third group was the various production classes hired in the city: a few blacksmiths had been hired, a few masons, and a smattering of other classes that I didn’t have the full list of. For the moment, they were easy to ignore. </p><p>Then, I turned my attention to the fourth group, the most confusing one among them all. The meager guild of Rosie, which had suddenly turned far more enigmatic after the warning message we received from her, triggered an unexpected chain of events. </p><p>I ignored the second, third, and fourth groups for the moment, and turned toward the largest, and the most fragile group. Their faces were etched with exhaustion and uncertainty, which was understandable. Sometimes, worry was far more exhausting than hard work. </p><p>I could see the doubt lingering in their eyes, fueled with a sense of powerlessness. A look that I was intensely familiar with from seeing it in the mirror, one that I felt whenever one of my applications had resulted in a rejection. </p><p>It was time to see if I could change it. </p><p>“Everyone,” I began, my voice steadier than my confidence justified. “First of all. Let me inform you that the greatest dangers we are facing have been resolved, and we have destroyed a cowardly enemy force, consisting of several hundred level warriors, but not before they had cravenly destroyed a nearby dungeon, filling our land with monsters.” </p><p>I could see fear, hope, and disbelief mixing on their faces. Some believed, while others clearly thought it was nonsense. But, none of them interrupted, which was the best I could hope for. </p><p>“But, they made a mistake. The army of monsters they let out, hoping to destroy us, is actually a whetstone to sharpen your edge. When we finish dealing with it, every farmer that’s willing to face the dangers will turn into a powerhouse that can single-handedly clean a dungeon.” </p><p>That statement was met with disbelief. Farmers just gaped in shock, while the guards reacted to it with mocking disbelief, treating the idea of farmers getting stronger as a joke. </p><p>It was the judgment time to see if my idea of a grand reveal would be useful. </p><p>“I know you can do it. After all…” I paused even as I reached for my belt and pulled a smaller hammer, one that clearly didn’t belong to the battlefield. “As a Blacksmith, I know the limits you can reach intimately!” </p><p>The sudden shock in the air was beautiful. The utter disbelief on the faces of the farmers, the shock of the guards and other town workers… and the late, feigned shock from the members of Rosie's guild, which was something I was happy to act like I hadn’t noticed. </p><p>A murmur rippled through the crowd, confusion and surprise spreading through the farmers, but the guards looked angry. </p><p>I could see Harold whispering several sharp orders to the ones that were looking the angriest to prevent an outburst. </p><p>Shouting for silence was an option, but I decided to go for something showier. I raised my hammer, and used the Quake attack on the nearest rock, which turned into dust while the sound exploded like thunder. </p><p>[-210 Mana]</p><p>The visible explosion of ability was enough to quell even the angriest-looking guard. Even with — likely supernaturally enhanced — prejudice toward the production classes, it was hard to stop themselves from imagining in the place of the rock and testing how they would fare. </p><p>It probably wasn’t enough to dissuade them forever, but I would take every second. </p><p>“As you can see, the idea surrounding the production classes, that they are useless, is nothing more than nonsense. What you lacked all along was an opportunity. An opportunity that was granted by our foolish enemies.” </p><p>I paid only a glance to the guards to confirm Harold was able to maintain discipline after my display before I turned back to the Farmers, whose disbelief was starting to mix with hope. It was better than I had hoped. </p><p>Maybe my help with their Nurture skill was more effective than I had been hoping for. </p><p>“The dungeon will give you the skills you need, while the monsters outside will allow you to improve your levels and upgrade your classes, and soon, you’ll be strong enough to fight against many warriors,” I declared. </p><p>Their expression turned into hope, while I reached my bag and pulled out an alloy. I could have reshaped it with my hammer, but instead, I hit it several mana blasts in quick order, turning it into a beautiful sword, one that I flicked toward Terry, my prospective assistant. He grabbed it, looking fascinated. “How about it, Terry? Do you want to show the world that even with the Farmer class, you can fight for a place for yourself?” </p><p>“W-we really can?” he asked, hesitant. </p><p>“Of course,” I said as I turned to Harold. “How about a little demonstration about just how strong a mere blacksmith can be, acting commander of the guards,” I said. </p><p>“As you wish, master,” he replied, his choice of wording, along with his bow leaving him no doubt about how he saw his position even after the reveal. The other guards looked at each other, no doubt coming to some conclusions about his knowledge and his most recent promotion. </p><p>It wasn’t entirely accurate, but I was never shy to use information asymmetry to my benefit. </p><p>“A light demonstration is all we need,” I said. “So, pick twenty guards to fight against me at once,” I said. </p><p>That earned a gasp of shock. Not everyone had seen me fight, and the declaration of my true class had created some misunderstandings. A reminder was required to teach them the truth. </p><p>In general, the guards were about as strong as the ordinary members of the team that tried to ambush me and Eleanor in the dungeon, but their weaponry was significantly inferior, while I was significantly stronger. </p><p>The ability to use mana attacks recklessly with each hit rather than rationing them carefully alone was a big game changer. </p><p>Harold looked hesitant at the declaration, but he still turned to the guards, who numbered around a hundred. “Any volunteers, boys?” </p><p>About half of them raised their hands, while a few of them, including the previous commander who had suddenly found himself as the second-in-command of the guards, just took a step forward, showing their intent to challenge me. </p><p>“Well, since all of you want to fight, feel free to come at me all once,” I said, which made the guards even angrier. “Just one reminder. If any of you have weapons or armor that you cherish for personal reasons, leave them behind.” </p><p>“I don’t think that will be a problem, sir,” the old commander said. I had to admit, I was impressed. I had never heard the word sir being pronounced like the f-word. </p><p>I was happy with it. It was not only a chance to reinforce my authority, but also a way to give Farmers hope. With the monsters around the dungeon getting more and more crowded, I didn’t have days to waste. </p><p>“Don’t say I didn’t warn you,” I said even as I switched to my war hammer. Technically, the spear would have been more efficient to deal with a crowd, but hit-and-run tactics wouldn’t give the real image. “First, let’s make sure that everyone can watch the battle easily,” I said as I waved my hand, and the dungeon mist dispersed in a wide area, earning shocked gasps. </p><p>A little showmanship never hurt. I could already see several guards looking hesitant, and a few quickly changed weapons, showing that they took my warning seriously. </p><p>“Attack,” the old commander ordered, frustrated, and the fifty guards rushed me without a plan, hoping to overwhelm me with numbers. I didn’t know whether it was the arrogance that led them to not put together a proper plan, or the fact that a careful, strategic approach where fifty guards turtled carefully to defeat me would have been the admission of their inferiority in the first place. </p><p>Not that it truly mattered. </p><p>What followed was a total beatdown, where I systematically destroyed their armor and weapons and and armors — and breaking the arms and legs of the stubborn people, but without using mana to make sure they could heal easily. </p><p>“I think I made my point,” I said as I looked at the old commander, who looked at me with frustration as he sat helplessly on the ground while his Health helped him to recover from a broken leg. He didn’t look angry at his wound, probably because he knew that I could have vaporized his leg if I wished. </p><p>“Yes, sir,” he said, his tone carrying a hint of disbelief, but mixed with respect. </p><p>Production class or not, a beatdown was quite memorable. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said, then I looked at everyone. “Like before, everything is on the basis of volunteering. If you don’t want to fight, level up, or don't want to take a certain skill, you don’t have to,” I said. </p><p>With that, the excitement was turning palpable. </p><p>“What is the first step, sir?” Harold asked. </p><p>“Simple,” I said. “I want a hundred volunteers to learn smithing from me. We’re about to fight a war, and the first thing we need is more weapons!” </p>",

    "content": "<p>Bringing down the hammer was a scary experience. I was tense, afraid of the pain that might arrive. Luckily, it was easier than facing my fear of flying. All I needed was to trigger the skill, and my hammer landed on the metal. </p><p>I wasn’t forging anything fancy. Just an ordinary iron dagger, but even as every blow helped it to bring to completion, my fear was in place. Only when it was completed, did I let out a relaxed sigh, enjoying the absence of pain. </p><p>“It went well,” I muttered as I examined the edge of the blade, stopping to appreciate my masterful craftsmanship. It was smooth, incredible, and utterly perfect. “Enough to sell for at least five silver coins,” I muttered in amusement. Not that long ago, it represented a small treasure for me, and earning that amount would have been an incredible profit. </p><p>And, now, I had a dungeon of my own and a provisional army, preparing to deal with dangers I couldn’t properly foresee. </p><p>“It’s interesting how quickly things can change,” I muttered. I put the dagger to the side. The moment I took a step back, it started corroding, as it wasn’t forged by dungeon products, and it was my presence that had been preventing its destruction. </p><p>I sighed. Watching the dagger slowly corrode felt oddly poetic … in a pointlessly edgy artistic way. I wanted to sit down and rest, but I couldn’t afford to, not when I had to deal with the management of the dungeon … and the absurd number of issues that came with it. </p><p>There were the management issues that I had to deal with now that Maria and Eleanor were gone, the monsters outside the dungeon that were growing in numbers every minute and needed to be addressed, the concern regarding how to handle the sudden presence of skill stones such as Meditation and Forge, both rare to acquire in their own right, the improvement plan for the farmers, the possible retaliatory strikes from the enemy… </p><p>“That’s a lot of work,” I grumbled as I grabbed another chunk of ore, and turned it into another dagger. </p><p>[-10 Mana]</p><p>[-10 Mana]</p><p>[-10 Mana]</p><p>[-10 Mana]</p><p>[-10 Mana]</p><p>Another success. This time, it was a mana alloy, but not the Epic variant. In that particular experiment, I decided to delay for the moment, as I needed to forge a lot of fire-resistant equipment to prepare for the intensity of the upcoming fire monsters. </p><p>I didn’t know what would happen when the monsters arrived at the dungeon entrance, but I much rather be prepared than the alternative. </p><p>Now that my horrible exhaustion had recovered, I was able to run to the first floor with ease. I found Harold there, along with the other guards, defending the perimeter intensely. “Sir,” he greeted me. </p><p>“Follow me to the third floor, and bring every guard there. It’s time for a meeting,“ I said. </p><p>“What about the security?” he asked. </p><p>“Don’t worry about it,” I replied. “No one could come in and out without my notice so long as I keep my focus,” I said. He just nodded in acceptance, which surprised me. “Really? You believe that. Just like that?” I said.  </p><p>“Sir, merely half an hour ago, the gate had disappeared and reappeared again. What you say is not exactly a stretch.” </p><p>“Good point,” I answered with a chuckle. Just as I was about to lead them to the third floor, I decided to experiment. I closed my eyes and once again focused on my connection with the dungeon. Another gate appeared, this time leading directly to the first floor. “Gather them quickly, I don’t want to waste time,” I responded. </p><p>“Yes, sir,” he said, looking even more impressed. </p><p>I hadn’t impulsively decided to show off. I wanted to give him a reminder of my power, which was a good way to assure him and the rest of the guards that all was well. I had read too much history to miss the importance of morale. </p><p>Though, it was not just a tool of assurance, but also intimidation. One that was required as I was considering revealing my true class as a Blacksmith. </p><p>I sighed, wishing that Maria or Eleanor were still here to discuss the idea. After finally having some peers to discuss my plans, going back to the silence of my head was not fun. Especially when it came to revealing my class. </p><p>There were a lot of cultural expectations around classes, expectations that I was starting to suspect weren’t all natural. But, regardless of its source, one thing was clear: people were set in their expectations and roles when it came to production classes. The moment I revealed it, I would open Pandora's Box. </p><p>Admittedly, I wasn’t comfortable with the idea, but I felt that the moment the dungeon started creating Forge, Repair, and Meditation skills, hiding it from our enemies was likely impossible. I couldn’t isolate the dungeon forever.  </p><p>The benefits of revealing my identity as a Blacksmith were significant, but so were the drawbacks. Admittedly, if hiding it from my enemies was still an option — which it no longer was considering the dungeon had started dropping Forge and Repair — I would have erred on the side of caution. </p><p>I thought about actually trying to maintain a double identity, but I couldn’t pull it off. I wasn’t that good of an actor. I was able to convince everyone as ‘Arthur’ mostly because no one had interacted with me in my true identity other than a few dismissive talks before I ‘died’. </p><p>“At least there're a lot of magnificent benefits,” I muttered. It was one thing to work alone, conducting every experiment alone, but potentially having hundreds of assistants to help me test my hypotheses … would be incredibly useful.</p><p>Just by replicating the work I had done and handling the more common parts of my research, they would multiply my efficiency. More importantly, that was the smallest benefit they would provide. </p><p>While I had made great progress during my expedition from a practical perspective, most of the practical benefits came from a few clever tricks that allowed me to upgrade my skills, which then allowed me to unlock the benefits of the dungeon. </p><p>Essentially, I was not too different from a landowner who got rich because he discovered an oil field under his farm. </p><p>Hopefully, once I had hundreds of people that I could work with, we could put together a more decent outline. </p><p>Then, there was the issue of mass production. The current method I had was enough to supply the dungeon with medieval tech, but the same wasn’t true if I wanted to start making something closer to modern. </p><p>I needed that because the most recent battle had been an amazing wake-up call. My current skills allowed me to bring out the benefits of my class in an incredible way, allowing me to fight above my potential. </p><p>Unfortunately, it wasn’t that impressive in a practical sense when my combat potential was equivalent to that of a flyweight, and I fought against featherweights. Fighting against heavier weight classes was impressive, but not when the world had the equivalent super heavyweight boxers like Maria, able to literally evaporate me. </p><p>“Man, I’m happy I didn’t use that metaphor against her,” I muttered in amusement, knowing she wouldn’t take being compared to a two-hundred-and-forty-pound man. Instead, I watched the guards pass through the gate. </p><p> I doubted a comment about weights would have gone well. </p><p>Unfortunately, the amusement I derived from the imaginary interaction wasn’t enough to sustain my good mood when the implications of the last fight were significant. Not just in terms of fighting against the force behind Thomas, but more in general. </p><p>What Maria — and her unfortunate rival — had shown had been incredible. Even on an extremely favorable battlefield, I would have failed against them in anything but outright assassination. </p><p>And, they were not the strongest combatant the world had to offer. Not even close. </p><p>I needed to change my way of thinking. Modern weaponry was tempting.  Unfortunately, unless I came up with some incredible adjustments, most of the small weapons that changed the modern battlefield, from machine guns to artillery, weren't exactly effective. With everyone having Health, their area effectiveness wasn’t as high, and their lack of mobility was deadly in a world where people could fly and turn invisible while also easily dealing damage that would be measured in kilotons. </p><p>I needed something armored, mobile, yet hard-hitting. Or, in other words, tanks. </p><p>Unfortunately, such a device was filled with complications. Just the material alone was prohibitive. Every tank alone would require somewhere between fifty to a hundred tons of metal, enough to make tens of thousands of swords. </p><p>And, considering all the effects, making it from ordinary alloys was not feasible. Mana alloys were required at a minimum, but Epic alloys would be better. Alone, it was impossible.  </p><p>But, it might be different if I had hundreds of people to assist me, especially if we could put together a decent production line together. </p><p>My thoughts were interrupted again when the guards finished passing through the gate. Only Harold was left, but I gestured for him to stop. For all intents and purposes, he was my second-in-command, and I didn’t want to ambush him with it, no matter how starved of time I was. </p><p>“Yes, sir,” he said. </p><p>I took a deep breath, trying to find the best way, before I sighed. “It’s about my class. I’m about to reveal that I’m a Blacksmith.” </p><p>I saw his eyes widen at the mention, followed by a revulsion, as I had just admitted a disgusting secret. It was a deep, instinctual shock, one that supported my theory about the System coming with some kind of cultural indoctrination. </p><p>To his credit, he was able to suppress that reflexive reaction soon. “I see, sir,” he said. </p><p>“No questions?” I said, surprised. </p><p>“Well, I’m curious about the timing, but it’s not exactly an urgent line of questioning,” he admitted. </p><p>I chuckled. “And, no problems following someone with production classes?” I added. </p><p>“Not particularly, sir,” he said with a chuckle. “I have seen you spar with Lady Eleanor. You can still take me down with ease.” Then, his expression tightened. “More importantly, you are doing your best to keep everyone that follows you alive. I can’t imagine a better quality in my guild master.” </p><p>I nodded in appreciation. “Do you think the other guards would accept it just as easily?” </p><p>He shook his head. “I think a demonstration about your capabilities might be in order.” </p><p>I smiled. “That, I can do.” </p><p>With that, we turned and walked toward the gate, my mind already occupied with how best to deliver that reveal. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Thirty minutes later, I was outside the dungeon, watching Eleanor and Maria disappear into the horizon. Eleanor was running, using the Floating Stride while also carrying a huge crate of equipment, while Maria sat on top of the crate, both wearing thick cloaks to hide their identity. </p><p>Maria could have flown, but it would have made it difficult for them to hide. </p><p>“I just hope they stay safe,” I muttered as I glanced out, watching the way the flame monsters spread. Only twenty minutes had passed since the devastating battle against a full team of ascended, and the flame lizards had already spread enough to cover half of the horizon. </p><p>Looking out, I wasn’t sure whether their presence was a curse or a blessing. Yes, they would make the immediate surroundings extremely dangerous, but also it should make any scouting attempt far more dangerous. </p><p>Especially since there was a considerable number of flying lizards at a distance, each larger than the boss monsters I had dealt with, making an aerial approach just as big of a challenge. I could see why they expected that dungeon to significantly hamper our development. </p><p>Of course, my assassination had thrown everything out of whack. </p><p>“All that remains is to understand whether eleven ascended warriors represent a significant force for our enemies, or just a small assignment,” I muttered. </p><p>Technically, there were two options. Either they represented a significant investment for the force I had managed to anger, preventing them from replicating a similar attack; or it was their attempt at gunboat diplomacy, and they still had a full fleet to take revenge for their inconsequential loss. </p><p>I feared that the second was the case, mostly due to the combat potential they had displayed. Yes, they were ascended, with both their Health and their other stats functioning far better than I had expected, but from the way they fought, it was obvious that they had some of the most common fighting classes, and their skills weren’t particularly impressive. </p><p>Likely there was a reason for it. My research results regarding natural skill upgrades had already shown that there was a hidden variable that I had yet to identify when it came to natural skill upgrades, and it wasn’t a stretch to assume that a similar — or the same — variable affected ascension, allowing weaker classes to ascend with a lower material cost, if not directly. </p><p>Of course, it was nothing more than another wild theory among hundreds that needed validation at this moment. </p><p>I walked forward, curious if there were any effects to me getting farther away from the dungeon gate.  </p><p>There was. I could feel my connection with the dungeon strain. It wasn’t much, more similar to the strain of picking a half-empty water bottle more than anything, a strain that slowly got stronger as I walked further away. </p><p>Surprisingly, the possibility of not leaving the dungeon didn’t annoy me that much. With the most recent enemy I had created for myself, leaving the dungeon to travel wasn’t on the plans for me anytime soon. Not when I had no idea about what magical methods they might have to follow me. </p><p>I turned back, feeling the exhaustion. </p><p>I was so glad that Eleanor visited the upper floors to explain the situation to them, meaning I didn’t have to go and talk with them, leaving me free to work in solitude and understand what my newfound connection with the dungeon meant. </p><p>I stepped through the gate, once again finding myself on the fifth floor. A wave of my hand, and two gates appeared. Another wave and it went back to the first floor. Surprisingly, that didn’t exhaust me.  Maybe it was like the difference between pushing a boulder up a hill and rolling it down. </p><p>I closed my eyes, focusing on the changes as it went back. </p><p>The first change I caught was a flow. Something from outside entered the dungeon from the first floor. It wasn’t the tainted energy, at least, not in the form that I interacted with it. It was the raw material the dungeon used to create the tainted energy, breaking it through the concept of corrosion to create the dungeon mist … but it felt like it mixed with another energy in the process. </p><p>Dungeon mist turned into monsters, which then provided mana and tainted energy.</p><p>I wondered if that raw form of energy would be more during the day. Based on the behavior of every other monster, I guessed that it would. </p><p>“It’s like photosynthesis, with products we need to kill to work properly,” I muttered.  I tried to understand the process. Of course, once again, my understanding was limited. Connection was like skills in that way, giving me the outcome, with no real information about the process behind it. </p><p>I had a feeling that killing was not a necessary part of the process, but an arbitrary step that was included due to the warped nature of the System itself. </p><p>I might be a bit biased on that. </p><p>For once, I was too tired to feel enthusiastic about revealing the mysteries behind it. Instead, I went back slowly without bothering to gather the metal bulwark, killing a lot of insects on the way — a process that resulted in several new skill stones. </p><p>To my surprise, Forge and Repair only went up until Common even when I piled the monsters together, while Meditation went up to Rare, though both were limited to ordinary variants.  </p><p>“Finally,” I muttered once I returned to the fourth floor. While the corrosion started to feel far more comfortable since I had received my skill, it did nothing to make wading through a deep dead swamp while being sieged by monsters any easier. Once I went back to my fourth-floor base, I sat down. Not to explore the dungeon. Not to plan. </p><p>Just to rest. </p><p>I closed my eyes and crossed my legs, trying to calm down. It was hard. It was hard to believe that merely a full day had passed since we had received the warning from Rosie. The fight had been dangerous, but at this point, it was getting too common. </p><p>Even the battle against ascended, though dangerous in theory, hadn’t felt emotionally impactful, especially since I was confident that they wouldn’t be sending more soon — and if they did, it wouldn’t be weak enough for us to beat them, which was why I didn’t argue with Maria to convince them to stay. </p><p>None of them impacted me as much as the unintentional skill upgrade I had gone through. The pain alone was horrible, one that left surprisingly little impact. Having a meditation skill that could potentially absorb tainted energy alongside mana was beneficial, but I was afraid of the implications. </p><p>It didn’t feel like it was stronger than the other, more generic skills. </p><p>I could feel the faint connection to the dungeon pulsing at the edge of my awareness as I breathed in and out. At this point, I didn’t need to focus to feel it. The opposite, actually. I had to focus to ignore its presence. </p><p>I took a deep breath, trying to calm down and focus … only to find myself focusing on the more immediate problems. </p><p>Like leveling. </p><p>“I wonder what kind of class I would receive once I level up,” I wondered. I stood up and started walking around the base, hoping that the movement would help me to calm down slightly. </p><p>It did not. </p><p>I sighed, and changed my direction toward the forge. Since it didn’t look like I could calm down, why not experiment on forging. However, as I stood in front of the forge, my fingers around the hammer trembled. </p><p>I was afraid of pain. </p><p>“Come on, Devon. Take your medicine,” I muttered as I closed my eyes, trying to focus on the moment. I was afraid of the consequences, but there was nothing I could gain by avoiding it. I needed to see if I could still use Forge. </p><p>Not to mention, with the dungeon suddenly dropping copies of my class skills, there was even more of an urgency to improve them. </p><p>Too many lives depended on it. </p><p>As much as I was afraid of experiencing the same extreme pain, I tightened the grip on my hammer. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I nodded at Eleanor, and with the signal we both rushed forward while Maria used the crusher to replenish her mana. She only needed a few seconds to replenish her reserves, but the three ascended we faced were more than fast enough to take advantage of it if we didn’t slow them down. </p><p>The idea of facing even one ascended warrior was a scary idea, let alone three. Luckily, we didn’t need to actually fight with them. Just delaying them for a few seconds, until Maria could replenish her mana, was a valuable strategic objective.</p><p>Especially since they were busy trying to return through the dungeon gate after having met an uncomfortable environment, only to realize that it was not an option.</p><p>It cost them a dangerous second. </p><p>My hammer was glowing with all the mana I could channel — which was unfortunately still limited by my Essence — as I caught up to the first one, and brought it down. </p><p>[-210 Mana]</p><p>His reaction speed was incredible. Even as I burst out of the mist, which he could only see three yards through, he still managed to twist and react. My hammer landed on his shoulder, and his blade landed on my chest. My hammer strike, even at full strength, didn’t manage to damage him a lot. His attack, on the other hand, sent me away flying. </p><p>Unfortunately for him, I had two advantages. One, the disparity in equipment was as wide as our power. More importantly, as I was delivering the mana attack, my mana transformed into the aura of decay. His ascended Health was strong enough to deal with it. </p><p>His armor wasn’t as lucky. </p><p>Meanwhile, Eleanor was more successful than I was, able to parry the attack against her. I righted myself even as I hit the water hard, and dodged the next attack by moving away. “Stop running, rat,” he growled. </p><p>Unfortunately for him, that was all he was able to say. That exchange was all Maria needed to replenish her Health. The flash of a fire attack was all that was needed to evaporate him, his ascended nature wasted. </p><p>Showing what a dangerous world we live in. </p><p>The one that was tangled with Eleanor was unable to retreat, while the third one proved to be faster, running to the opposite side. Unfortunately for him, I was able to chase him, especially since the mist didn’t hide him. </p><p>Two hits from my spear were enough to destroy his armor and weapon, and the newly acquired decay attack was enough to deal with him. It was a fortunate benefit. Not worth the torture I had gone through to acquire it, but a silver lining was better than dark, suffocating clouds. </p><p>With his equipment gone, he had two options. Either turn and fight, risking a quick death. Or escape, and risk a slow, torturous one as he ran to the fifth floor, the corrosive aura slowly burning him up. </p><p>He chose the former, and proved that, even with his bare hands, an ascended warrior was very dangerous. A bare punch threw me back like a rag doll. </p><p>But, it hurt far less than the flash of intense fire from Maria. Then, another. And, just like that, three ascended warriors, each dangerous enough to threaten a town in their lonesome, were gone. </p><p>Eight still remained. </p><p>I noticed Maria was flying toward the exit gate once more. “Stop!” I called hurriedly. </p><p>“Why? We already dealt with three of them. We can destroy the rest!” Maria shouted, more angry than excited. I was guessing that she had a story with that frost mage. </p><p>A story that was making her miss our great advantage. “No. If you appear there alone, they will know that something is wrong, and that this is more than a desperate last stand,” I said. “And, we certainly can’t hunt them outside the dungeon.” </p><p>“What are we to do, then? Just wait?” she asked sarcastically, confirming my guess about personal hostility. </p><p>“Exactly that,” I said. “They have sent the three ascended warriors to chase you, and they should be expecting them to have the absolute advantage since they didn’t choose to return. We can deal with them at once.” </p><p>“Good point,” she admitted. “Are they still approaching?” </p><p>“Yes,” I said. “They will be here in less than a minute. Let’s take our positions.” </p><p>“Good,” she said, then paused. “What was that attack?” </p><p>I sighed. “It’s like the attack of the dungeon monsters, only better,” I said. “Now that my connection with the dungeon is reinforced, I can impose a stronger variant of the corrosion aura to my attacks,” I explained, then paused, wondering if I could focus it even more. </p><p>“It was weird. It lingered out for a while before it dispersed. As if the dungeon doesn’t absorb it back.” </p><p>I paused, realizing that she was right. I had just missed that detail while being thrown like a toy, surviving only by the merit of my armor. “You’re right,” I said as I rushed toward the gate they would arrive, raising my hand, the mana flowing out boundlessly. </p><p>The dungeon wasn’t absorbing it back, and the aura of decay stuck around at the entrance, but without my control, it was already dissipating. It was a devastating attack, one that was only possible to deliver under the very rare strategic conditions I had been dealing with. </p><p>Including the gate allowing me to know exactly when to retreat. </p><p>“A question, is that frost mage ascended?” </p><p>“Thankfully, no,” Maria admitted. “If he were, things wouldn’t have gone that smoothly. He’s an old enemy.”  </p><p>I would have loved to ask more questions, but there was no time. “Two seconds,” I declared as I watched the other eight ascended and position themselves toward the entrance, while I stood in front of the metal bulwark, side by side with Eleanor. </p><p>With the combined aura of decay and corruption, the eight ascended warriors had met with a very unfortunate situation. Their armor and weapons melted like they were made of ordinary iron dipped in sulfuric acid. </p><p>Their bodies, with the assistance of their elevated effectiveness of Health, managed to resist it better, but it still caused some damage, enough to leave them vulnerable to Maria’s attacks. With a burst of fire, one of them disappeared, making me very glad that I had picked the path of friendship with Maria.</p><p>She was a good friend, an almost scary ally, and an absolutely terrifying enemy. </p><p>Even with all their disadvantages, the ascended warriors rushed forward, realizing the precarious nature of their situation, with their possessions already destroyed. </p><p>Eleanor was fast enough to dodge them in close quarters, while I stuck to my spear, maintaining the distance. Occasionally, an explosion would reduce their numbers, but at one moment, I rushed forward, my spear carrying the energy of decay. </p><p>Just as the frost mage appeared at the gate. </p><p>I knew that he was a dangerous enemy, but I also knew from experience that equipment played a big role when it came to the strength of a mage. One hit, along with the leftover aura of decay I had pumped, had been enough to destroy his armor.  </p><p>A good thing, as the immediate spell I received in response was devastating enough. I found myself frozen in the water. A desperate blast of decay aura destroyed the ice and I jumped away, just in time for a jagged blast of icicles to pass through where I was standing. </p><p>But, that was all he was able to do before Maria flew toward him, her hands burning. “Finally. You’ll pay for your betrayal,” she shouted. </p><p>“Wait. I can —” he started as he flew away, but Maria had the decisive advantage. I prepared myself to rush forward … only to see another amazing sight. Eleanor, dancing between four ascended warriors, the mana from the crusher wrapping around her sword, increasing the devastation she delivered several times. </p><p>It would still have been a desperate last stand followed by a defeat if it was a fair duel against any of them. That much was obvious. However, she was fighting against four barehanded naked warriors that had been softened by Maria’s fire spells. </p><p>The fate of the battle was inevitable. </p><p>I rushed toward the gate, making sure to cut their path even if Eleanor failed to deal with them. The last thing we needed was one of them escaping. </p><p>We couldn’t let our enemy learn just how much of a close call our victory had been, and not just in terms of our most recent power-ups. If the enemy showed even a modicum of care while entering the dungeon rather than chasing us piecemeal, things might have been horribly different.  </p><p>Soon, Maria landed, a vicious smile on her face. “Carla has been avenged?” she said, earning an equally vicious nod from Eleanor. </p><p>“What next?” Eleanor asked. </p><p>Maria looked at me with hesitation. “You’re going to leave, right?” I asked. </p><p>“We have to,” she said. “The fact that this bastard is working with Thomas is not good news. We need to go back to my family compound. It’s not normal.” </p><p>“Alright,” I nodded. I understood where she was coming from, and even if I didn’t, it wasn’t like I could imprison her. And, I could sense her urgency. Also, it was a good time for her to leave, before the dungeon creatures spread too much to cut her path completely.  </p><p>“But, before you do, I want you to promise something,” I added. </p><p>“Like you promised not to experiment on yourself.” </p><p>Despite everything, I smiled. “Hey, I fulfilled my promise and didn’t experiment with Meditation before I received your approval.” Then, I looked at her seriously. “I want you to travel in disguise, and if possible, don’t go back before ascending.” </p><p>“But, what about the money —” Eleanor started. </p><p>“You can sell the spears and other equipment we forged. I’m sure it’ll earn all you need and more.” </p><p>Maria looked hesitant. “But, your concerns about the city lords targeting you,” she asked. </p><p>I chuckled as I glanced at the dungeon around me. “I have a feeling that it won’t be my biggest problem anymore,” I admitted. “But, if you’re worried, return as quickly as you can. I have a feeling that I will need a lot of reinforcements soon.” Then, I paused, thinking about how an organization would react to an unexpected but devastating loss of such a strong lineup. “But, not too soon,” I added.  </p>",

    "content": "<p>If there was one good thing about the astral torture I had just experienced, it was that the exhaustion I was feeling was completely gone. </p><p>But there was also bad news: I didn’t feel like myself. As I walked, I could feel the corrosion around me, one that I didn’t call decay despite the name of my skill, because I could feel that it was nothing more than an inferior copy of what I had seen in my dream. </p><p>A mere echo. </p><p>That echo felt like a part of my body, one that prevented me from feeling like myself. It was difficult, complicated, and weird. After what I had experienced, I was hesitant to consume any more crystal from the boss monsters, and let Eleanor and Maria consume one. </p><p>“You know you don’t have to —” Maria started once we arrived at the gate, but I silenced her with a sharp gesture. </p><p>“No, I do,” I growled. “Otherwise, you wouldn’t have run from the ascended like —” I found myself spitting out angrily, only to stop myself. It wasn’t fair to get angry at Maria, not when I was the one who volunteered for it. </p><p>“I’m sorry,” I said. “Do you mind giving me a moment?” </p><p>“Sure, we’ll handle setting up the defenses. Take all the time you need,” Maria said, concerned. I nodded in appreciation, and closed my eyes before I did something stupid. </p><p>I reached for my meditation skills. </p><p>The rotating sphere was no more, replaced by a nebulous aura of the same energy of decay I had seen in my vision, only contained. It clearly belonged to the conceptual category of Meditation that required Wisdom rather than the analytical one based on Intelligence. </p><p>I proceeded to the next step. I shattered a shell, and let the skill do its work. It had been absorbed almost instantly, with a speed that could compete with Maria’s Meditation. Which one would win, I wasn’t sure.</p><p>I shattered another one, slowing the process down as much as possible. The rotating sphere absorbed the mana gently by separating the two. My new meditation skill didn’t distinguish, absorbing both under a suffocating wave. </p><p>As I used it, I realized the connection between me and the dungeon was two ways. Just as it replaced my mana, the reverse was true as well. The excess mana went to the dungeon. </p><p>From a practical perspective, it actually looked promising. My biggest problem was supplying my Epic skill with enough mana, and it was clearly not a problem anymore. </p><p>Too bad it was replaced with a deep sense of frustration and fury. Admittedly, it might be about the weird mental journey that felt like it lasted for months, but I doubted it. Everything I had observed regarding the System suggested that it impacted our mindset in various ways I was yet to pinpoint, and I wasn’t willing to believe that an astral trip that gave me a Mythic Skill had none. </p><p>I sighed as I opened my eyes, and went toward the forging equipment I added to the cart. “In for a penny, in for a pound,” I muttered as I grabbed my hammer. </p><p>“Are you sure?” Maria asked the moment she noticed me. “You’re pushing yourself too much!” </p><p>“I know,” I said. “But the situation is dangerous enough. It’s best I practice.” </p><p>“No, I forbid it,” Maria said, cutting me off. </p><p>I wanted to argue, and lash out, but once again, I forced myself to stop. “You’re right,” I said. “I think I will pause for a moment, and not use any of the class skills.” I could see Maria opening her mouth, but I gestured for her to stop. “No, not using externals is out of the question. A battle awaits us,” I said. “Now, let’s continue setting the area up to turn this into a defensive bulwark —” I started, only to suddenly wave my hand reflexively. Suddenly, one gate split into two, three hundred feet apart. </p><p>“What did you do?” she asked. </p><p>“I split the entrance and the exit,” I replied. “I can feel that they are connected, so I can’t bring them too far away, but it should prevent them from scouting easily.” </p><p>“Good point, but no more experimentation,” she said. </p><p>I nodded. “You’re right. It’s just … hard to resist the impulse. Some of these actions truly feel natural.” </p><p>Splitting the entry and exit meant we had a better location to set up our defenses. We created a large wall, with several entrances. I worked with Maria on the details, while Eleanor killed the insects that gathered toward us. </p><p>It was too simple for my tastes, but with my concerns about not using my other class skills, it was the best we could do. </p><p>“Umm, guys,” Eleanor called as we were putting the finishing touches on our setup. “Did this dungeon ever drop a Forging skill before?” </p><p>“No … why?” I asked even as I had a sinking suspicion as to why she was asking. She threw a skill stone toward me, and I grabbed it. </p><p>[Skill Stone: Forge (Common)]</p><p>“How fun, another discovery to make the dungeon an even bigger target,” I chuckled, sounding a little more hysterical for my own tastes. </p><p>“Devon, this is huge,” Maria gasped. </p><p>“I know,” I said, but once again, I had to swallow the pointlessly abrasive answer I wanted to give, and instead forced myself to think about the implications. </p><p>Implications such as having hundreds of blacksmiths producing not only raw metal but also working on more intricate pieces. The possibilities were endless. </p><p>Of course, I doubted we would survive the retaliation if what we were doing here was revealed … but then, that was true for several other things. What was one more? </p><p>“You’re right,” I said, smiling for the first time since I had suffered that unexpected skill upgrade. “We can do a lot here. We just need to survive the attack first.” </p><p>Maria nodded. “Exactly,” she said as she examined the area. “This place looks strong enough to resist them,” she said. </p><p>“I think we need to go out,” Eleanor said. “Not you,” she added, pointing at me. “We have no idea what leaving the dungeon will do to you. I’d rather not experiment.” </p><p>“A good point,” I admitted. “But, be careful. If they are waiting for you at the entrance —” I started, thinking it alone gave me the vision of outside. Hundreds of soldiers, led by a dozen ascended, currently climbing the mountain. “It’s clear. They are climbing the mountain. Maria, it’s a perfect chance for you to strike,” I said. </p><p>She nodded as she floated out, already glowing with mana. The moment she appeared, she started raining mana. The ascended managed to resist her area attacks with ease, but the rest of the army wasn’t as lucky. Eleanor stayed guard, parrying arrows with ease. </p><p>Their coordination was a thing of beauty. </p><p>But, soon, Maria’s mana was depleted. As they returned through the gate, I started the crusher, so when she floated, she already had a roomful of mana waiting for her. She replenished her reserves in a second. “Three of the ascended split from the group and are rushing toward the gate. They are the archers,” I warned her. </p><p>“They want to catch me before I get too far away. Tell me when they are a hundred yards away from the gate,” Maria said, her smile cruel enough to scare children. </p><p>I didn’t like just how easily a matching one found my face. I gave her a signal. They went back, catching the three ascended unaware. Eleanor deflected the arrows while Maria retaliated with another wave of fire attacks. </p><p>Their equipment had something similar to the anti-fire alloy I forged based on the beast claws, but it was an enchantment. </p><p>It was clearly a beautiful enchantment, but in a mana-deficient area like our current environment, without natural replenishment, it soon reached its limits, shattering. </p><p>I didn’t know much about the strength of the ascended, but it was clear that their endurance wasn’t enough to resist Maria’s concentrated attack. Their Health worked hard to compensate for it, but it was already failing. </p><p>Until, a wall of ice appeared, easily pushing back Maria’s flames. </p><p>A figure floated, his smug expression appeared even from a distance. I couldn’t hear what he said, as the vision from the gate didn’t include sound, but Maria’s fury didn’t need any translation. </p><p>I was glad that Eleanor was there to grab her by the arm and drag her inside, as she looked furious enough to stay and fight. I was very tempted to ask who he was, but I didn’t have the time. “Take cover, they're right behind you,” I shouted at them. </p><p>Luckily, despite her anger, Maria followed that cue. </p><p>Just as they arrived next to me, three ascended appeared at the gate. </p><p>Only to immediately sink into the swamp of corrosion rather than the tame desert they had expected. Even with their equipment already damaged, they could survive until the other eight returned. </p><p>I needed to fix it. </p>",

    "content": "<p>When I stepped on the fifth floor, the first thing that greeted me was … homecoming. At least, it felt like that. It was not something I expected to feel in a dungeon, particularly at its most hostile location. Yet, I did. </p><p>I closed my eyes, and made a pushing gesture before I removed my filter. “What are you doing?” Eleanor asked, looking shocked. </p><p>“I can remove it as well,” I told her. “I can … control the corrosion aura,” I said, feeling fascinated. It was a weird sensation. In a way, it felt like controlling mana, but slightly wilder. I wasn’t suddenly controlling all of it, but my immediate surroundings were different. </p><p>“Are you sure that’s a good idea?” Maria asked. </p><p>I shrugged. “We’re not exactly in a position where we can be careful,” I responded. “Not with the enemy we’re about to face. How much time do we have?” </p><p>“An hour? Two at most?” Maria said. “Even if they don’t replace their mounts, they can just run here.’ </p><p>“Exactly —” I started, only to pause. </p><p>“What’s wrong?” Maria asked. </p><p>“We need to set the crusher,” I said hurriedly. “Maybe even some defenses.”  </p><p>“Why?” she asked. </p><p>“Because I can feel at least twenty boss monsters rushing toward us, and they seem agitated,” I said. “They clearly don’t like my presence.”</p><p>“Twenty?” Eleanor said. “That’s a bit much,  even for us, right?” </p><p>“Not that much,” I said. “They won’t arrive together. We’ll have several seconds between each arrival, which will give us time to deal with them,” I said. “If we didn’t have Maria with us, however, things would have been much harder. It looks like taking over a dungeon is more challenging.” </p><p>“Maybe we should go back, and let the invaders deal with the boss monsters. It’ll soften them up, and if we can pin them down between the boss monsters and the gate between the fourth and fifth floor…” </p><p>“Tempting, but I don’t want them getting the crystals. It was not fun when Maria tried to connect with the dungeon, and I don’t want them to repeat it.” </p><p>“Good point,” Eleanor said, then paused. “Also, there’s no guarantee that they would find the gate we’re waiting for them at. Things can get really bad if they pick an alternative direction. What are you going to do with the crystals?” </p><p>“I think I’ll absorb them. For better or worse, the connection between me and the dungeon feels final. It feels like reinforcing it is a better idea than just letting it grow on its own, right?” I replied as I finished setting up the steam-powered crusher for Maria to replenish her mana quickly, though it took some of my reserves. </p><p>However, setting it meant I had to spend some mana, which I was reluctant to do, as I didn’t know if I could use Meditation to replenish it.</p><p>[-45 Mana]</p><p>My eyes widened when I checked my mana reserves. </p><p>[Mana 210/210]</p><p>“What’s wrong?” Maria asked. </p><p>“My mana,” I responded. “It replenished instantly once I used it.” </p><p>“Because of the dungeon connection?” Maria asked. </p><p>“Most likely,” I responded. Suddenly having unlimited mana sounded like an excellent advantage, but I was still afraid of the side effects. “But, focus. The first monster will be here in a minute.” </p><p>She nodded, and we turned toward the boss monsters. The battle that followed was … boring, not that I was complaining. </p><p>Attacked by twenty dungeon bosses in less than ten minutes would have been a very dangerous siege if Maria hadn't been able to take them down easily with one spell, making the process far easier. Thinking about the implications of my connection was far more stressful. </p><p>“That’s it, for now,” I said as I absorbed the last crystal, once again quickly piled everything into the cart, which was being pulled by a steam engine. </p><p>“For now?” Eleanor asked, surprised. </p><p>“I can feel even more dungeon bosses moving toward us, but they are quite some distance away. Only two should arrive before we reach the gate, so moving to set the defenses is the better option.” </p><p>Eleanor nodded as she helped me pile everything up on the cart, and then we started to wade through the corrosive mist. </p><p>As we moved, Maria approached. “So, you have infinite mana?” she said. </p><p>“I don’t know,” I said even as I raised my spear and used a few mana attacks. The notification of mana dropping appeared repeatedly, but my mana never dropped. “It feels more like my mana is being replenished immediately after it’s used. I’m probably pulling from the dungeon reserves.” </p><p>“Makes sense,” she said. “Can you still use Meditation?” </p><p>“I don’t know. Let me see,” I said as I paused for a moment, closed my eyes, and meditated. </p><p>It was the biggest mistake of my life. A pain hit me, with an intensity that I had never felt before, invading my whole being. A part of me realized that I was drowning as I thrashed, but it didn’t seem to be a big problem. </p><p>No, it felt like a solution. Instead of feeling that pain, I would much rather die. Unfortunately, a pair of arms tried to pull me from the water to stop it, one that stopped just as quickly as they flew away. Yet, I found myself floating … </p><p>I could hear shouts and cries … but they faded a long time later. </p><p>What replaced it was… A dream? A vision? A new reality? I didn’t know which. All I knew was that I stood at the edge of a giant mountain, looking at a battlefield. </p><p>The sky itself was torn apart, and great monsters spilled through it. Monsters so horrendous, even the largest, most dangerous monster I had fought was nothing against them. Those creatures radiated something alien, something that could best be described as the antithesis of life. </p><p>Darkness. Madness. Evil. Chaos. I had no idea what to call it. All of them fit equally. Or, maybe, didn’t. </p><p>The planet itself was an alien entity, one that was filled with an aura of decay so thick that it should have evaporated me immediately. Yet, it did not. Instead, it was a part of my breathing. I raised my hand, only to see a chitinous carapace rather than an arm. </p><p>It should have scared me, but it did not, not when I looked down, seeing an army of insectoids. They weren’t like dungeon creations, reckless and mindless. What I saw was an army that wielded the decay energy with impossible precision as they defended themselves against the entities of darkness that tried to invade them.</p><p>A hopeless battle, with the remnants of a once-great civilization in ruins around them, their magic ineffective against the wave of darkness, the creatures endless and overwhelming at once. </p><p>One insect stood tall among the others, tall enough to be a skyscraper, its carapace filled with intricate golden and silver patterns. Yet, it didn’t move like a monster, but carried a staff on each of its four arms, glowing intensely. </p><p>Unlike the other attacks, every blast of light from its staff took down one of the invading beings, but their numbers were endless.  </p><p>Tens of thousands of insectoid warriors swarmed against the monsters, their exoskeletons gleaming under the strange light of the torn sky. They were disciplined, their movements precise as they formed ranks, their shields raised and weapons ready. </p><p>Despite that, I could feel a desperation in their stance. Every single one of them knew the hopelessness of the battle, yet they fought as their lines were overwhelmed by the endless monster waves, their numbers endless. The insectoid army got smaller and smaller, and the very land started to collapse against the weight of the darkness.  </p><p>Soon, the giant insectoid was the only one left, yet it wielded the very concept of decay to the limit. With each movement, with every sweep of its staffs, everything around it corroded... </p><p>Until it fell as well. The planet I was on shattered, and I floated with that piece. Then, that piece was captured by something and … disappeared. I found myself floating in nothingness. The vision was gone, leaving only pain behind. </p><p>I wanted to die … but a stubborn part of me refused it. I could not. Why, I didn’t understand. But, I could not. </p><p>I didn’t know how long the pain lasted. My best guess was months. Maybe years. My eyes were blurred with pain, but I managed to read something despite that. </p><p>A notification, my mind supplied. </p><p>[Cleansing Meditation (Uncommon) 134 -&gt; Meditation of Decay (Mythic) 100]</p><p>When I opened my eyes, I found myself looking at Maria and Eleanor, their faces filled with worry. “H-how long?” </p><p>“How long what?” Maria asked. </p><p>“How long was I unconscious for?” I asked, my voice surprisingly smooth. </p><p>“What do you mean?” Maria said. “You were walking, then you suddenly started to thrash. Ten seconds?” </p><p>“Well…” I muttered as I pulled myself onto my feet, expecting myself to be hurting badly. But, there was no pain. “I think I have just upgraded a skill above Legendary,” I muttered. I wanted to smile at their astonished expression, but even the memory of that pain was too strong. </p><p>“Really?” Maria asked, shocked. </p><p>“Yes. But, I can’t recommend repeating the process. It’s not a fun experience. At all,” I muttered as I stood up. “We still have a siege to deal with,” I said. </p><p>“Are you—” they started simultaneously, but I cut them off. </p><p>“Yes. I need a distraction,” I said, determined. </p>",

    "content": "<p>As we moved around on the fourth floor, I said nothing other than pointing directions, which was only partially about the undignified nature of my current transportation. </p><p>It was more about getting a sense of my new connection with the dungeon. Just the act of passing through the dungeon gate had turned into an adventure that was hard to describe. There was the usual sense of weightlessness, but there was more as well. </p><p>As I shifted floors, I realized that I had some kind of connection with the floor than the dungeon. It wasn’t very intense, even the barest hint required my full focus, and processing that information was equally challenging. </p><p>But, as we reached my fourth-floor base, some of the details were obvious. The sensation from the floor I was currently on was the most intense, while the sensation from the other floors was muted. Yet, even muted, the sensation of people using gates was one I could identify. </p><p>Now that I was on the fourth floor, it was hard to distinguish whether that movement was on the third floor or the second one, but knowing I would feel any possible interloper on the fifth floor felt promising. </p><p>Assuming, of course, they didn’t have a way to block it, which was not out of the question. </p><p>“What’s the plan,” Maria asked once we arrived at my base. </p><p>“I think I can feel them entering through the gate, but I’m not a hundred percent sure,” I admitted. “I think the first thing we need to do is to discuss the capabilities of the ascended warriors,” I said. “That way, I can contribute to the situation.” </p><p>Eleanor paused. “It wouldn’t be wrong to define them as … better in everything,” she admitted. “Their stats are more effective, their external attacks are stronger be it vitality-based or mana-based, and even their skills are better.” </p><p>“An all-around improvement,” I said, frowning. It was not exactly good news. “When you say their external attacks are stronger, do you mean similar to Epic skills?” </p><p>“No,” Maria answered. “The denseness of an Epic skill comes from the way the mana is folded and structured. The ascended people just have … a different kind of Health and Mana.” </p><p>“Superior?” I asked. </p><p>Eleanor nodded while Maria shook her head. “It’s superior, isn’t it?” Eleanor questioned, looking at Maria. </p><p>“Well, before I started working with Devon, I would have called it simply superior as well, but it’s not as simple. Their mana is certainly more impactful, but also less flexible.” </p><p>“Less flexible like solid?” </p><p>“No. You would have defined it as higher viscosity,” Maria corrected. “It’s still flexible, but it feels more determined to stay liquid rather than shifting between gas and liquid. Also, it feels harder to transform,” She added, blushing. “Sorry, it’s not an ideal description.” </p><p>I waved my hand. “You watched them in a battle. It’s not fair to expect you to have a perfect analysis report,” I said. Unfortunately, the practical implications of that information were limited. “What about the practical side of things? Is it too different from the Epic variant?” </p><p>“More potent but less flexible,” she admitted. “But, the quality doesn’t look the same between different users. But, as long as I can replenish my mana, I think I can defeat one of them easily. Maybe two of them.” </p><p>“Is it because of the class difference,” I asked. Maria nodded proudly. “Good news,” I said. “We already have the vision advantage, and it’s far stronger on the fifth floor. Hopefully, they won’t come with a counter to corrosion effect, and we can deal with them.” </p><p>“Do we need to discover the gate,” Eleanor asked. “If so, we need to start moving.” </p><p>It was a good question. I closed my eyes, and focused on the connection once more. This time, I didn’t focus on the movement, but on the floor underneath us — assuming that it was actually underneath, which it might not have been. </p><p>“Give me a minute,” I said instead. “I think I can feel the location of the gates.” </p><p>“Don’t push yourself,” Maria requested. Eleanor clearly had the same idea. </p><p>I did my best to give them an assuring smile. “Don’t worry. Now that I rested, I’m feeling better,” I said. It was an exaggeration to say that I was feeling better, but at this point, we couldn’t afford to wait. The moment I bonded with the dungeon, retreat stopped being an option. </p><p>And, the situation in the dungeon was a siege. An unconventional one, maybe, but still a siege, and their attempt to breach the defenses was our greatest advantage. We couldn’t afford to delay reinforcing that point just to keep me safe. </p><p>I nodded before I closed my eyes, pushing deeper into the connection. It was unlike anything I had ever experienced. In a way, it was like trying to play with a poor VR set, causing dizziness more than anything. </p><p>My awareness of my immediate surroundings faded, replaced by an abstract sense of the dungeon. I could feel all five floors at once, each with a different intensity … almost a different taste. </p><p>I pushed some more, and that abstract awareness turned into something more real. I could feel every single gate connecting the floors … not only that, but also the energy flowing between them. The tainted energy circulated inside the dungeon, going between the floors. </p><p>The moment I focused on the energy, I could feel that it was something that the dungeon treated as hostile … no, not hostile, I corrected, but something to deal with. </p><p>However, it wasn’t the only thing that was going on. The tainted energy came from the gate leading outside, while the mana entered the dungeon from the certain nodes on the fifth floor, rotating in the dungeon. </p><p>It was an early, weak conclusion solely based on nebulous feeling, but I had a feeling that, by opening the gate on the fifth floor, I had interrupted something critical in the way the dungeon functioned. As if I had closed the air intake valve for a mine, which interrupted the breeze that was needed to let out the methane. </p><p>However, it was just an impression. I was careful not to make any rapid judgment. </p><p>Having a direct connection with the dungeon was an interesting thing, giving me an instinctual understanding of what was going on inside just like how people had an understanding of their bodies. But, just like our bodies, I couldn’t be sure the instinctual feedback I had received was correct. </p><p>There was a reason it took thousands of years for medicine to develop. We couldn’t trust every sensory feedback. </p><p>However, that didn’t mean I needed to ignore and write them off either, certainly not during an emergency. I still wanted to shift the dungeon entrance back to the first floor as soon as possible, as when in doubt, maintaining the status quo was the smarter short-term solution most of the time. </p><p>Then, just as I focused on the fifth floor to pinpoint the location of the new gate, I noticed something interesting. </p><p>The corrosion. </p><p>Up until now, I had always assumed that the corrosion was just a side effect of the tainted energy, a hostile part of the dungeons like the creatures … but it was not. Nor was mana its source. </p><p>It was hard to describe, but I could feel the way the flow moved. It felt like an inherent part of the dungeon, one that seemed to be breaking down what we called tainted energy. Unfortunately, it was once again a brief sensation more than anything else, meaning I couldn’t be sure that what I felt was accurate. </p><p>Understanding the process was even more of a pipe dream, at least in the short term. </p><p>I ignored both, and focused on the gates, trying to feel their positions. </p><p>The fifth floor was huge, almost a hundred-mile radius … which I found absurd even with everything else that came along with the System, but since we were under an imminent siege, I had to focus on the location of the gates. </p><p>Which was easy to discover. The gate leading outside was in the middle of the wilderness, almost ten miles away from the nearest gate, which was apparent on the map I had drawn on the ground. </p><p>“That looks far away. We need to move before they enter,” she started. </p><p>“We do,” I answered. “I feel like I can open another gate near them, but …” </p><p>“You’re not sure whether you can close it on time,” she added. </p><p>I nodded. “It looks like a risky experiment to avoid traveling a few miles through the swamp.” </p><p>“Should we bring some of the guards?” Eleanor asked. </p><p>“No,” I responded. “I expect they will lead with the ascended, and considering the way we fight, their presence will make little difference. It’s better to let them level up.” I was reluctant to use anyone as sacrificial lambs, but it was not why I said that. </p><p>For what was about to come, their presence would be a hindrance. </p><p>At least, for the first wave. </p><p>“Let’s go,” Eleanor said, but I gestured for her to wait, and started to pile all of my available metal that could resist the corrosion of the fifth floor into a cart, which was more than a hundred metric tons, some shaped into simple a form, some as a raw pile. “You can’t be serious?” she gasped. </p><p>“Why waste the opportunity to properly reinforce the entrance,” I responded, my smile wide despite my exhaustion. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Maria looked at me, her concern clear, so I forced a smile on my face. “Success,” I said, trying not to show my exhaustion too much. </p><p>“Are you feeling alright?” she said. “It’s still not too late. We can find a way to—” she started. </p><p>I cut her off. “No need, everything is perfect,” I said. “We have done this for a reason. Now, why don’t you go and talk with Eleanor before they start panicking about the disappearance of the gate,” I said. </p><p>“And, where did it go?” she asked. “Closed?” </p><p>“Unfortunately, no,” I said. “I just shifted it to the fifth floor, so if they try to enter, they will end up in the middle of the swamp. Hopefully, the mist and the corrosion aura would slow them down and give us a chance to attack.” She opened her mouth, her curiosity obvious. But, she managed to hold herself back when I raised my hand. “Talk with Eleanor first while I catch my breath…” </p><p>“Are you alright,” she asked again. </p><p>“Good, just exhausted,” I muttered even as I took a step toward the nearest rock, which turned into a stumble. The exhaustion must be worse than I realized. Maria still looked worried. \"Don’t worry. I have felt the same when I pushed myself using Meditation,” I said to her. </p><p>Her expression showed that it was not the best explanation. “You almost killed yourself while playing with Meditation. Was that supposed to make me feel better?” </p><p>“Not that time,” I said. “I tried to reverse the flow when I almost killed myself. Exhaustion was from when I experimented on ways to push it further.”</p><p>She looked even more worried. </p><p>I paused for a moment, realizing that I wasn’t making a particularly compelling case by listing all the different ways I hurt myself while experimenting with Meditation. “Please,” I added. “I just need a minute to rest. I can always signal to you if I need you to return urgently.” </p><p>It didn’t prevent her from putting her hand on my temples and sending another wave of mana through my body. In any other situation, it would have been rude, but I could see that she did it from a place of care, so I held my tongue. She pulled back, her frustrated silence showing that she wasn’t able to find anything. “I’ll be back in a minute. Do nothing,” she warned. </p><p>I chuckled even as I waved at her, and watched her fly away faster than I had ever seen her. </p><p>Despite everything, it was good to have friends that worried about me. </p><p>I closed my eyes for a moment as I sat on the rock. Not to meditate, as the last thing I wanted was to activate a skill as the exhaustion washed over me. No, I just wanted to catch my breath … though even that was a bit of a misnomer. </p><p>The type of exhaustion I felt had no physical implications. I felt like I could run for hours, and work on the forge even longer. But, the prospect of using Meditation to refresh my mana felt like an impossible chore. </p><p>I wanted to call it mental exhaustion, but it wasn’t exactly that either. I was familiar with that, often when I locked myself in an office to deal with a particularly complicated problem. It left me feeling depleted and exhausted, but what I was feeling seemed to be something more fundamental. </p><p>I wondered whether it was more about the bond itself, or if changing the gate took more from me. Though, my curiosity wasn’t enough to make me repeat the attempt, not before I started to feel better. </p><p>If I started to feel better. </p><p>I took deep breaths, wishing that the situation allowed me to sleep. Unfortunately, that was not exactly an option under the circumstances. We would still be attacked soon, and even with all the advantages afforded by the fifth floor, what awaited us was not an easy battle. </p><p>I wished that I could just remove the gate and turn the dungeon into some kind of a secret demesne, but the brief impression I got when I switched the door told me that it was impossible. </p><p>As I pondered on that, Maria returned, accompanied by Eleanor. “Are you alright? You look terrible?” Eleanor greeted. </p><p>I chuckled. “You don’t look so good yourself. Did someone pay you to swipe a chimney?” </p><p>Eleanor turned to Maria. “He must be in a really bad state to make such a horrible joke,” she said. </p><p>“What a burn,” I chuckled, looking at the state of her armor as I did that. It was easy to make those jokes with her state being that strong. </p><p>“How are you feeling?” Maria asked. </p><p>“Better now that I was able to catch my breath. The exhaustion is here, but it’s not getting worse. I feel like it’s about changing the location of the dungeon gate rather than our meddling with the connection itself. Feels like it impacts the body exactly the way Meditation does.” </p><p>“Directly in the soul?” Maria said, looking alarmed. </p><p>I paused. “Soul?” I asked. </p><p>“Well, it’s common knowledge, right?” Maria said. “Meditation has nothing to do with the body. Ergo, it’s done by the soul.” </p><p>“In a way, yes,” I agreed, swallowing about a hundred arguments I was ready to deliver about the existence of the soul, especially when it came to such a simplistic conclusion regarding it, but I held back. It was a fun discussion to have when we had hours to kill, not when we were trying to come up with emergency plans to defend ourselves against a potentially overwhelming enemy. “We better decide on what to do. Unless, of course, we think that the fifth floor will be enough to dissuade them from attacking.” </p><p>Their matching frowns answered my rhetorical question. “If it was a raid for profit, it would have,” Eleanor started. </p><p>“But, you don’t deploy ascended warriors to make a profit,” Maria completed. “Not to a location like this.”  </p><p>“What do you mean?” I asked. </p><p>“It takes a fortune to make someone ascend, and sending them to battle leaves them vulnerable to enemy assassinations. Also…”</p><p>“What?” </p><p>“We don’t know why, but some ascended are reluctant to act while others are happy to fight every day,” Eleanor added. “There’s a difference between ascension methods, but we don’t know much. They keep that information secret.” </p><p>“I thought your family had ascended people,” I asked. </p><p>“We do,” Maria admitted. “But, my situation is a bit complicated. They are not exactly lining up to reveal secrets,” she admitted, then made a general gesture. I nodded, understanding her point. If it wasn’t for her ‘complicated’ situation, she wouldn’t have been on the outskirts, trying to operate a low-grade dungeon in the first place after reaching her level limit. </p><p>“So, the ascended warriors are here for revenge, meaning I have screwed up royally when I killed that mage,” I said. </p><p>“No,” Maria said. “The fact that they deployed someone like that alone means that eventually, they would have deployed similar forces. At least, this way, we’re not caught surprised.” </p><p>I appreciated her statement, even though it was not an honest assessment of the situation. “Well, let’s look at the positive,” I said. </p><p>“There’s one?” Eleanor asked, chuckling.  </p><p>“Of course. Intentional or not, we crossed the Rubicon. At this point, we are committed to defending ourselves, which means there’s no point hiding every little secret.” </p><p>“I don’t get it,” Eleanor said. </p><p>I paused. “First, a question. What’s the force any of the city lords could send to such a distant location without risking a potential attack from their opponents,“ I said. </p><p>Maria paused. “Tough call,” she said. “I’m sure, if they are determined, they can easily mobilize a dozen ascended mages and warriors, something like a couple thousand elites without risking themselves. Maybe more. I’m not exactly familiar with the highest echelons of power.” </p><p>I frowned. “Well, that’s a bit more than I had expected, but still. Do you think they would commit to it if there was a risk of losing that force?” </p><p>“No,” she replied quickly. “Especially not to a mana-dead location where most of the advantages of their ascended mages would be blunted. No matter what, it’s not a small commitment.” </p><p>“That’s our silver lining,” I said, unable to hold back a smile. “If we can defeat a force that has already committed multiple ascended warriors, it’ll be enough to signal to them that tangling with us is not a safe idea. Especially since they have to travel a long distance and leave themselves exposed to attacks from the other forces.” </p><p>Maria looked excited at my description, quick to realize the advantages of the situation, as we had discussed several ways to leverage the excess metal production into a mini-industrial revolution. </p><p>Eleanor didn’t seem to be as quick. “Would no longer hiding everything really matter that much,” she asked, dubious. </p><p>Maria answered faster than me. “Oh, believe me. It’ll be a game changer.” </p><p>“It’s fine to get excited, but first, we need to go to the fifth floor,” I reminded them as I prepared to jump, but even the attempt to mobilize my Health to use the Fleeting Step sent a stab of pain through my whole being. A gasp escaped my mouth. </p><p>“It looks like someone has to carry me,” I admitted, unable to prevent my blush. </p><p>Asking for a piggyback ride was a rather undignified request, but the situation was too urgent to allow pride to rule me. </p><p>As much as I wanted to blame Eleanor and Maria for their chuckles, I could not. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Watching Maria approach while carrying clear signs of battle damage, while Eleanor was absent, was not good news. However, as she approached closer, there was no grief on her face, which prevented my mind from going to the worst place. </p><p>“What’s going on,” I asked as the griffin landed near, looking worse for wear. </p><p>“I- it’s bad, I need mana,” she called. “Quick!” </p><p>My eyes widened as I quickly activated the crusher, glad that we were prepared for this exact eventuality. Only when she was at the center of the flow, pulling the mana in rapidly, I questioned her. “What’s going on?” </p><p>Her expression turned grim. “The dungeon is already breached, and the gate you discovered isn’t the only one. We’re cut from every direction, and…” </p><p>“And, what?” I asked, realizing it must be something really intense to make her hesitate like that. </p><p>“Ascended warriors, multiple of them,” she said. I tensed up. Ascended, meaning above hundred. I had no idea how strong they were, but I wasn’t willing to risk it. “Don’t worry, I managed to take down their mounts,” she said. “Even if they could replace them easily, we have enough time to evacuate the town into the dungeon.” </p><p>I paused, realizing that she was about to leave. “Are you needed outside?” I asked.</p><p>“There might be other dangers,” she said. </p><p>“True, but those ascended warriors would eventually arrive here, and we can’t hold them on the first floor.” </p><p>She looked at me, looking disappointed. “You can’t ask us to escape. Not after everything. We have thousands —” </p><p>I interrupted her, appreciating the concern she was showing. “No, the opposite,” I said. “What if we can change the destination of the entrance? Do you think it’ll be easier to defend against them on the fifth floor, with their weapons and armor getting damaged every second?” </p><p>Her eyes widened. “You want to push for a decisive battle.” </p><p>I shrugged. “That’s the best option, right? No need to bring thousands that couldn’t even slow them down. Or trying to escape, only to end up in a hopeless chase through wilderness that we would eventually fail.” </p><p>Not to mention, I felt responsible. I remembered the panicked way Thomas reacted once I killed that mage who had been trying to break the dungeon. The sudden appearance of warriors who could have dealt with us with ease didn’t feel like something Thomas could mobilize on his own. </p><p>It looked like I had poked the beehive. </p><p>“It’s too risky,” she countered. </p><p>“Riskier than trying to fight ascended warriors on equal footing?” I asked. She looked like she wanted to say yes, but she could not. “Fine,” she said even as she looked at me. “Sit down. I’ll guide you based on what I have understood.” </p><p>”Good,” I said as I crouched down as she had requested, focusing on the center of the orb created by my Meditation skill. “I can feel the connection through Meditation,” I said. </p><p>“You can?” she said. ‘There’s nothing about that in the notebook.”</p><p>“Check my notes,” I said. </p><p>“What’s a tesseract —” she started, then gasped. </p><p>“Not those, and not now,” I said as I ripped the papers from her hand. “One potentially deadly experiment at a time!” </p><p>“But, what you have written there —” </p><p>“Completely theoretical, and potentially enough to evaporate you from the face of the earth if there’s a mistake about the theory. The idea that the same pattern of behavior works just as well in the fourth dimension is just a raw theory!” </p><p>“Fine,” she said. She put her notes down, and instead focused on the others. Her expression of surprise wasn’t any less than the previous notes. “You want to further stabilize the connection,” she said. </p><p>“Makes sense for an emergency attempt. Everything in his notes is based on the idea of breaking the dungeon entrance before cutting the connection. We don’t have the luxury.” </p><p>“But, what if it turns permanent?” </p><p>I sighed. “We can think about it then. Please, just make sure the process is internally consistent, and won’t kill me.” </p><p>Silence ruled as she went through my notes. I looked at the horizon where people were entering the dungeon in a hurry. Only when they stopped did Eleanor arrive, her armor carrying several black patches like she had been subjected to flame attacks. </p><p> “The idea seems consistent. It won’t kill you, as far as I can tell,” she admitted, showing her reluctance. </p><p>“Good, then, guide me,” I said even as I closed my eyes. </p><p>“Focus on the connection,” she said. “It must be a weak, fragile link. Try to reinforce it slowly with your … Health is probably the better option for what you are trying to do.” Then, her hand landed on the back of my head. “Just one point, nothing more!” she added. “I need to see there’s no adverse effect.” </p><p>The link wasn’t weak or fragile like she described, but I didn’t exactly have a point of comparison. Either way, following her clues was a good idea. I did, pushing a sole point of Health through the connection. </p><p>[-1 Health]</p><p>In response, the dungeon around me … pulsated. “Did you feel that?” I said. </p><p>“Feel what?” she said. </p><p>“The dungeon, it shifted,” I said. “Or, was it just my perception?” </p><p>“Probably the latter,” she said. I felt her mana exploring my body. I could have pushed it out despite the great difference in stats, but I let her. “There’s no side effects that I can feel. Another point,” she followed. </p><p>We repeated the same trick five times before I interrupted her. “We probably need to be faster,” I said. I didn’t want to hurry a potentially dangerous process, but the idea of fighting against people who actually intimidated her on a battlefield was even less palatable. </p><p>“Fine. Ten points, nothing more,” she said. </p><p>[-10 Health]</p><p>This time, I felt a shift in my body. It was weak, almost impossible to detect, but my mana got … slower. </p><p>Dirtier. </p><p>It was a subtle, but familiar feeling. I had no doubt that, if I hadn’t forged tens of thousands of pieces of equipment, each carrying the properties of anti-corrosion, I would have missed it. </p><p>“I can feel something shifting. The dungeon energies are getting more familiar,” I said. As much as I wanted to keep it a secret to keep her from worrying, considering her current role, it was a very unwise idea. </p><p>“How so?” she said. I briefly explained the details. “Do you want to continue?” she asked. “I won’t blame you if you change your mind.” </p><p>I pushed more of my Health through connection as an answer. </p><p>[-20 Health]</p><p>“I get it,” she said as her grip tightened. “But, I’d prefer less dramatic answers next time,” she warned. </p><p>“Noted,” I said, unable to help but chuckle. It felt somewhat hysteric. The experiment was similar to what I had pulled with Meditation, but there, I had at least had the response from the System, confirming that I was on the right path. </p><p>The thing with the dungeon didn’t seem to register on the System. </p><p>Under her guidance, we repeated the same process with mana, until we turned it into an alternating pattern of Health and mana, which seemed to work the best. I could feel the connection getting stronger. </p><p>No, stronger was the wrong word. The connection had been plenty strong already, whether due to my misguided forestation project or the absurd number of boss crystals I consumed, I didn’t know. But, the connection turned more focused, like an old TV, with reception getting clearer as one adjusted the antenna. </p><p>“I think we need to use the Epic variants for mana and Health,” I suddenly said. </p><p>“You sure?” she asked. </p><p>“Yes,” I  responded. “It’s hard to describe, but the connection is more conceptual than I had expected. And, the denser variants have more ... Conceptual weight.” </p><p>“For a professor, you enjoy throwing around words without truly understanding their meaning,” she grumbled. I wanted to say she was wrong, but I could not. She was right, after all. I just chuckled. “Fine, try it,” she said. </p><p>I did so, and the connection got even stronger in my mind. Consequently, I could feel my Health and Mana getting even dirtier with the concept of corrosion. </p><p>The risk was obvious. The dungeon was dangerous. I wondered if I could have dared to establish such a connection if it wasn’t for the feeling about the dungeons. If the system was a game — a deadly, aggressive game with horrible consequences — then the dungeons were its tutorials. </p><p>Equally inefficient, aggressive, and horrible. Fitting. </p><p>I was aware that the connection could easily kill me. Somehow creating a connection with an external object that seemed to cover hundreds of square miles was intimidating. </p><p>It was ironic that, even when facing that idea, I was more afraid of releasing discoveries publicly. Human nature was scarier than the potentially deadly eldritch construct that seemed to operate in its dangerous but rigid rules. </p><p>As we repeated our process, things shifted. I could feel my body change, but it paled in comparison to the other changes. I had a certain awareness of the dungeon, with some aspects being easy to change. “Is the evacuation complete?” I asked. </p><p>“Yes,” Maria replied. “Eleanor has walked in with the rest of the guards.” </p><p>“Good,” I said, and sent a mental command. One that came as easy as breathing. She gasped. I didn’t need to open my eyes to know, but I still did, and saw the gate was gone. </p><p>Victory. However, no matter how much I wanted to smile, I could not.  </p><p>As, not only did the connection with the dungeon feel irreversible, but a deep exhaustion settled over me the moment I changed the location of the gate. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Hi everyone, </p><p>With chapter 172 done, we have finally reached the end of the story. For those that are interested in, I want to say a few things about the story. </p><p>Immortal Freeloader had been my first foray into writing a cultivation story, which, I have to admit, had quite a few challenges that I hadn't been expecting when I had started, especially since I had mixed it with both a cheat and isekai concept. Overall, I enjoyed writing it, but I can also understand why it wasn't my most popular story ever. </p><p>Frankly, my initial objective was to make the character more of a nihilistic wanderer than anything else, but at some point, the story transformed in a direction that I hadn't initially planned. </p><p>I wanted to end the story, mostly because our dear freeloader had reached the end of his journey, not only fighting mysterious interdimensional enemies, but also against ethos of avoiding responsibility. While it could be written even more, without continuing the conflict between his morals and the world, I fear the story will turn into a bland mess. </p><p>I know that there's many open plot points, from the true nature of Heavenly Treasure Pavilion, to the fates of Pearyin, Janassa, and Aisnam; not to mention the conflict between the martial arts and the cultivation, but that's intentional. I'm already planning to write a sequel, but it won't have the same main character. </p><p>Instead, it'll analyze the situation from a different perspective, showing the aftermath of the situation from a unique - and hopefully entertaining perspective. </p><p>Though, that brings me to my last point. The next story that will take its place in the update schedule. Blacksmith vs. the System will continue in its usual 7 chapters a week pattern, but another story will replace this in the schedule. (Though, probably after taking a break one or two weeks to plan it properly, but Blacksmith will continue to be published in that period.) </p><p>I want to ask your opinion about what should follow it? </p><p><strong>Option 1:</strong> The sequel from the perspective of a different character that I had mentioned above, which will mainly be another cultivation story, but this time from the perspective of a native character, and without a cheat system like the previous ones. </p><p><strong>Option 2:</strong> Continuing Wild Dragon of Rome to completion. </p><p><strong>Option 3:</strong> Rewrite A Gamer Adventure (Leveling through Lust). It's probably a controversial choice, particularly for the people who want a continuation of it. I actually tried to write a direct sequel to it. The problem is that it was my first long-form story, with a lot of structural issues that make a sequel an unappealing challenge without aggressive, sweeping changes. But, be warned that, if I rewrite it, I'll significantly reduce the amount of erotica it contains. </p><p><strong>Option 4:</strong> A brand new story, which you can think of it as a lootbox with a completely random result will pop off. I have a few ideas, but even I don't know which one I'll ultimately go. But, there's a good chance it'll be more sci-fi-themed than the usual. </p><p><em>Just a little reminder that I'm not fully guaranteeing with the winner of the poll, as there are other factors that'll affect my final decision, but that's naturally only if the results end up being close. </em></p>",

    "content": "<p>I didn’t know what was the reinforcement they had summoned, but one thing was certain. It was not a mere Nascent Soul force. </p><p>“The chips are down,” I muttered even as I triggered the formation to send a message to the agents I had sent around every capital, giving them the signal to kill the imprisoned Everdawn nobles under the capital. </p><p>Was I confident it would work? Definitely not, but I found myself in a weird situation where I had lost any semblance of control, and it was time to push the situation. </p><p>And, push it it. </p><p>The results had been immediate. The skies darkened at once, and for a moment, the world had stopped. Then, I saw a huge wave of Providence appear all around the domain. It was pure and invigorating, but also intense. </p><p>If killing the demonic cultivators earned a glass of water, it felt like an endless lake. The said lake split into two, with half hitting near the misty mountain, where the Symbol for Burning Ice was, which then disappeared toward the depths. </p><p>Where the volcano had been standing. </p><p>“No!” the three remaining Nascent Soul cultivators had shouted at once. Two of them had evaporated under Qi blasts just like their unlucky coworker, and the leader would have probably ended the same way if it wasn’t for a giant hand appearing from the gap in the sky, wrapping around him to protect him from the blast, before pulling him back. </p><p>“You will pay!” he shouted even as the hand pulled back, before the skies had transformed. Just in time, as a blast of blizzard hit just where they had been moments ago, probably the courtesy of Elsana, but it was far stronger than what I had seen earlier. </p><p>It looked like the sudden burst of Providence helped them more than enough. </p><p>I would have appreciated it, but the other half hit the giant tree, which suddenly started to grow even more, its already unbelievable size reaching an unbelievable size, bypassing my concealment formation easily. </p><p>I wanted to many things, but I could do nothing but crouch down as the tree pulled me toward it, and soon ended up sitting underneath it, lost in the moment of its increasing power, feeling the connection between me and the tree getting stronger. </p><p>It was wild, instinctual, in a way that I couldn’t truly understand. All I could understand was that my powers had not only reached the display Mrinta had displayed in his moment of recklessness, but actually surpassed it.   </p><p>I crossed my legs, doing my best not to burn out. I hoped that the cultivators would stay away for a while. </p><p>If not … well, I doubted that I should be afraid of the cultivators anymore.  At least, as long as I stayed in the mortal domain… </p><p>As for the future… </p><p><strong><u>/</u><em><u>\\</u></em><u>/*\\</u></strong></p><p>Tanpitana Tnak, Outer Elder of Kartpa Valley, master of the merciless fist, was not a happy man. It was bad enough that he had been punished for something that wasn’t his fault for a year, but even his punishment had been interrupted. </p><p>Now, he was being dragged like a mere mortal. </p><p>It would have been enough for him to explode in anger, but not when the two cultivators that were dragging him through gold and marble corridors were also Golden cores, and unlike him, they were Inner Sect elders. </p><p>Unlike the last time, he wasn’t ordered to kowtow, but his head was pressed to the ground by the elders. With his cultivation already sealed, he could do nothing. </p><p>He was about to apologize to his young master, only to freeze when he noticed his expression. The young master was furious. </p><p>Suddenly, Tanpitana had a feeling that his life was over. He had never seen the young master furious before, but his mild annoyance had ended up with him imprisoned. “Tell me whether you’re a traitor, or merely incompetent, you lowly worm,” he started, his voice crackling with a dangerous darkness that revealed the true nature of his demonic cultivation. </p><p>“I’m not a traitor, my lord,” he said, even though he knew that he could feel that he was signing his death. He had seen people get executed for less. But maybe, just maybe, he could get a clean death. </p><p>“Just incompetence then?” he said. “Do you think that you can explain all with incompetence?” He stayed silent. “Answer me!” </p><p>“I … I don’t know, master. I was in isolation,” he admitted. </p><p>The young master waved his hand, and suddenly, a letter flew toward him, one that had been explaining everything that had happened during his imprisonment. A mystical land, discovery of a spirit vein that was at least third grade, a mysterious tree, the loss of a Heavenly Treasure Pavilion ship…</p><p>And, most importantly, the appearance of another true inheritor with the bloodline of the founder, one that came from the same mystic land that he failed to discover… </p><p>Tanpitana bowed his head in surrender. A moment later, darkness… </p><p><strong><u>/</u><em><u>\\</u></em><u>/*\\</u></strong></p><p>I didn’t know how long I had stayed underneath the tree, trying to control the unrestricted power without killing myself, but one night, I had a dream.  </p><p>In that dream, I saw Pearyin, standing in front of me even as I tried to control the wild essence of the tree without killing myself. It was a dream … yet it was not. </p><p>“I miss you, master,” she whispered wistfully as she leaned forward, pressing her lips against me in a gentle kiss. As she kissed me, I felt the power that had been wreaking havoc to calm down. </p><p>…</p><p>When I opened my eyes, my martial arts had finally reached its peak, but there was no Pearyin. There was no Dao Gate either. I recognized what it was. A goodbye forever. </p><p>“Well, I disagree,” I muttered even as I stood up. Her despair indicated that she faced problems that would crush me. At least, she believed so.</p><p>Maybe they were.  </p><p>Luckily, I can always cheat.</p>",

    "content": "<p>From the new, smaller flying boat, flew out a team of elite cultivators. Three Nascent Soul cultivators, and a hundred Golden Core ones. I watched even as the one at the center of the formation turned to the other ship. “Mrinta, I should have known. Exiled in a pathetic lesser world, and still failing. You’re the disgrace of our family.” </p><p>I continued to float, glad to have a moment to examine the situation, which allowed me to connect with the formation and hastily update several parts of my defenses, using my newly acquired Golden Core formation technique to the limit. </p><p>If they wanted to argue about whatever problem they were having, I was happy to acquiesce. Every second worked to my benefit, and not just in terms of updating the defenses. It also allowed me to observe the newly arrived reinforcements. </p><p>First, I started by examining the Golden Core cultivators, who had formed into a battle formation. The same Treasured Golden Army Battle Formation I had already learned, which was fortunate, and not just because it made my eventual defense much easier. </p><p>It allowed me to assess the potential strength of the new arrivals. The first team I had been dealing was not particularly competent in using the Formation, their expertise spotty at best, averaging Minor Familiarity at best, with several at Beginner, which was the reason for my easy success.  </p><p>Meanwhile, the new arrivals were clearly far more capable, solidly at Minor Accomplishment. I could foresee several ways to defeat them, but none would be as impressive as the first one, which was a problem. The more I struggled, the more I would show my limits. </p><p>I tightened my fingers even as I wondered if maybe I should send the message to the people I distributed to various capitals, asking them to shatter the tombs, throwing a bomb into the situation. </p><p>In the end, I decided against it. It was a bomb, but one with an unknown radius. I wasn’t afraid of it not being effective. </p><p>I was afraid of it sweeping me up in the explosion. </p><p>I watched even as the two Nascent Souls threw several insults, before the Mrinta finally went inside his ship in shame. Only then, did the first one turn toward me. However, instead of saying anything to me, he gestured at one of the Golden Core cultivators that wasn’t a part of the Formation. </p><p>He floated toward me and threw a storage ring at me. “You’re being annoying, you spineless dog. Take it, and scram,” he said haughtily, acting like he was the king and I was a mere slave. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 370; Insult Bonus - 470 (Capped)]</p><p>[840x Return - Stabilized Storage Ring - Heaven Peak-Grade]</p><p>[840x Return - Sword of the Tranquil Wave - Heaven Peak-Grade]</p><p>[840x Return - Immaculate Robe of Dark Skies - Heaven Peak-Grade]</p><p>[840x Return - True Reversal Formation Cultivation Technique - Heaven Low-Grade]</p><p>…</p><p>[840x Return -  - 84000 Spirit Stones, High Grade]</p><p>I was glad to see the System taking that as an insult from him despite the Golden Core cultivator passing it to me. </p><p>As I took note of the hundreds of notifications filling my view, I was barely able to hide my smile. He was clearly insulting me, as the ring was filled with various Black Grade items, mostly for Golden Core, barely more than pocket change for a Nascent Soul cultivator like I had been acting. </p><p>Of course, I was not, and even without the System, the techniques that filled the ring would have been a treasure for me. With the System upgrade, particularly with such a great multiplier, it was enough to fulfill every single need I had. </p><p>As long as the world could provide enough Providence, of course, but that was something for the future. It wasn’t as critical.  </p><p>“Thanks, one never knows what to gift the outer disciples,” I said as I took the ring shamelessly — wrapping it with a formation in case it was a trap. I didn’t want to reject the gift no matter how ‘disgraceful’ it was. </p><p>And, it was clearly so, if the utterly disgusted expression of the Golden Core cultivators was any indicator. I didn’t care even as I used the formation to move the ring back to the center of the formation, and pulled the Spirit Stones that was already inside. </p><p>Luckily, they were only medium grade, which was more fit to be used by the Golden Core cultivators due to density. It was good news, as I spread all ten thousand of them across my newly constructed formation, immediately boosting its strength several times. </p><p>As for high-grade ones that the System returned, I didn’t pull them yet, like I didn’t redeem any of the techniques yet. I had no idea how much providence they would consume. </p><p>“Good, now scram,” the nascent soul leader called from behind, still shocked. </p><p>“Why, so that you pathetic merchants could flex your pathetic capabilities against helpless mortals,” I replied dismissively. “I told your pathetic slave before. This area is determined to be my holy sect’s trial ground, and none is allowed. Leave, or I destroy all of you!” </p><p>Once again, my taunt was extremely effective, showing that it probably had been years since someone had spoken against them in such disrespect. Admittedly, I wasn’t entirely happy with my own attitude, but I needed to defend the area without making them realize that I was doing it to protect the mortal domain. </p><p>I didn’t want them to start taking cities hostage to make me comply with their wishes. They seemed to be entirely capable of killing millions just to annoy me. Hell, I had a feeling that Providence and Karma were the only things that prevented them from killing people just for the fun of it. </p><p>“How dare you! Just because I can’t use my true powers in this pathetic little world doesn’t mean that I had to listen to you. Destroy him!” he shouted. </p><p>The golden core cultivators spread out, forming a semicircle around me, with two of the Nascent Soul cultivators taking place at their positions, but the familiarity with the technique allowed me to recognize the gap they had left. I expected him to take it, but instead, he looked back to the original flying ship. “Mrinta, come here and show your worth.” </p><p>“But —” he answered even as he floated out. </p><p>“I don’t care. Either use your powers, or you can explain your failure to the council,” he replied. </p><p>Mrintaa looked frustrated, the reason which I only understood when he had taken his place at the center, the providence around him flaring actively. </p><p>I tensed, realizing that he was trying to use his true Nascent Soul powers. </p><p>That was tense. My understanding of the true might of Nascent Soul was extremely limited, but what I knew was enough to tell me that facing it directly would have been extremely unwise. </p><p>Luckily, I was prepared for that eventuality already. I first triggered the formation I had created, triggering the formation-based attack I had been building while they had been posturing, raining against the weak points of their formation. At the same time, I threw several martial arts punches to further damage, followed by several martial arts punches. </p><p>However, against a battle formation led by three Nascent Soul cultivators, one actively risking his life by using his true power, that was merely a distraction, one that they would inevitably understand. </p><p>So, I decided to give them a show. </p><p>I pulled a small copper piece from the System Inventory, one that was completely ordinary, making a show of looking at it in my palm, while forcing my face to lose color. “So be it, Merchant,” I called angrily. “Embrace your fate!” </p><p>I squeezed the coin, destroying it. At the same time, I summoned a million strands of Qi at once and pumped it to the formation. The sudden burst of Qi was not necessary, but it was not why I had summoned it in the first place. </p><p>The action had pulled Providence from all around me, including all the Providence that they had been using to isolate themselves from the world. The situation of the three passive ones had been devastating, but it was nowhere near what Mrinta experienced. </p><p>I expected him to get damaged, but I certainly didn’t expect a flash of Qi from the depths of the ground, evaporating not only him, but also half of the Golden Core cultivators around him in the formation. It was something even more intense than the attack from the volcano. Like a sleeping giant had woken up for the first time in centuries.  </p><p>I had to admit, it was a good reason to be careful about not using their powers. </p><p>Unfortunately, while I watched what had been going on in shock, the leader broke some kind of talisman, one that was clearly there as a tool for communication, disappearing in the sky. </p><p>A second later, the sky had been ripped completely. </p>",

    "content": "<p>After a momentary consideration, I refrained from triggering the latest technique I had received. While the techniques triggered considerably less Providence than artifacts, it would still consume more than the singular Qi Drops I had been summoning earlier. And, it meant that the Nascent Soul cultivator in front of me might notice the fluctuation in the Providence. </p><p>Admittedly, I didn’t put that chance very high, not with the way the Providence cycled around him. It must interfere with his ability to detect the way Providence shifted, but it was not a certainty. </p><p>Not to mention, there was no advantage in triggering it immediately. Not when I could try to anger him. It was a rare opportunity from the benefits of the System. Not in terms of the multiplier — which was significant, but not as significant as the Golden Cores — but in terms of the techniques he had certainly possessed. </p><p>One absentminded comment from him could resolve every single problem I had for the future. </p><p>“You talk too much for a coward that’s hiding behind your juniors, merchant,” I said, angering him further. </p><p>He was close enough that I could see his face, and the flash of anger that went through his face surprised me. It was too intense for a man who presumably lived for centuries … but then, maybe not. He might be old, but it didn’t necessarily mean that he was wiser. </p><p>More importantly, in terms of Earth, he was somewhere between a dictator and a celebrity. Too used to get respect from the people that surrounded him, but he clearly forgot how to handle base disrespect. He had enough self-control not to attack immediately, which meant it was useless as a tactic, but he was fighting in a battle he was not used to in the first place. </p><p>“You’re pushing your luck,” he said. “You think you can resist Heavenly Treasure Pavilion by yourself.” </p><p>I believed that I had a chance, especially since I had discovered a way to improve my actual strength without compromising my System gains, which should improve my power curve with far more ease. But, I couldn’t tell him that. Instead, I snorted. “You think I’m afraid of a bunch of jumped-up peddlers, running around like parasites across lower worlds for little slivers of power,” I responded with exaggerated laughter. </p><p>“You’re lucky that we can’t use our powers here, or I would have eviscerated you,” he responded, his eyes icy. </p><p>His choice of words was telling. Couldn’t, rather than wouldn’t, which confirmed my earlier assumption that Nascent Soul cultivators were restricted from acting due to the way Providence worked, and it was unique to the lower world.</p><p>It had a limit. And, if the writings from the Burning Ice sect were to be trusted, that limit had been lower in the past. No wonder there was no mention of any cultivator above Foundation Establishment in their records. </p><p>It stood to reason that, when Ancient Martial Arts were stronger, the world itself was stronger compared to heavens that seemed to include the cultivators — two convenient names based on the direction of the power I detected lately — and attacked the cultivators whenever it detected. </p><p>It must be treated the cultivators like parasites, destroying them whenever they were noticed … and stronger they were, or the more powers they used, the easier they be noticed. </p><p>I had to admit, it felt nice to connect the dots to create a comprehensive picture … even if that picture was scary. Like the fact Treasure Pavilion sent a Nascent Soul to lead the expedition despite the clear danger the world posed to him. </p><p>Meaning, ultimately, he was a disposable entity. </p><p>I had already realized that the cultivation world had a weird, exponential scale of power I had trouble understanding, but I had clearly underestimated the ultimate scale of their strength.  </p><p>And, so did the chips they were playing. I had assumed correctly that the cultivators were playing a game of power over the mortals, one that looked nonsensical at first glimpse, but only because I had missed the nature of the game.</p><p>Where the chips showed the whole world. </p><p>At this moment, as I looked at the Nascent Soul cultivator facing me with a furious expression, I realized that it was my last chance to get away. The moment I defeated the giant flying ship, it would put me in the radar of Heavenly Treasure Pavilion, and likely other forces that could match them. </p><p>But, leaving right now would mean a tantrum from the Nascent Soul cultivator; one that, when delivered by a person of his power, would probably result in many millions of deaths. </p><p>With a sigh, I waved my hand, constructing a formation, wildly aware that I was stepping on the back of a tiger that I could never step down from. </p><p>The irony is that it all started with a system called the Freeloader System, one that put a sardonic expression on my face even as I waved my hand to create a formation in the air.</p><p>The formation was not for combat. Now that I had decided to fight a force that likely surpassed me by a significant margin, I needed to be ready for more. And, the best way to achieve that was to bait the angry Nascent Soul cultivator in front of me for more. </p><p>The formation had many layers. The surface was made of Qi Drops, the condensed form the Golden Core cultivators were able to create, but it was merely there to prevent the enemy from realizing the bones of the formation were made of Martial Essence. </p><p>And, in between, a thick wave of ordinary Qi flared, making the formation far more threatening than it was supposed to be. However, while it was threatening, it was relatively simple. </p><p>Ultimately, it was a bait and a distraction at the same time.  </p><p>While that distraction was going on, I triggered the System, finally understanding the battle formation they had set up, which was at the Golden Core level. Luckily, after my experiences with Nascent Soul techniques, I wasn’t surprised by the flood of information, easily identifying the true nature of the layout they had created. </p><p>And, all the weaknesses I could take advantage of. </p><p>Meanwhile, the Nascent Soul enemy was distracted by the formation I created, which looked strong enough to threaten Golden Core cultivators. I raised an eyebrow, a wry smile tugging at the corner of my mouth. “Unlike you, I don’t have to deal with discount formations,” I teased nonchalantly. “Unlike me, you can’t see the weaknesses in the structure —” I started, only for it to shatter a meager Qi flex from him. “How!” I gasped in shock, like he had achieved something impossible. </p><p>“You think you can trick with that pathetic garbage tier three-technique,” he laughed vigorously. “Its weakness is apparent.” </p><p>“I-impossible, you must have used an artifact, you pathetic merchant,” I shouted back. </p><p>“You think so?” he replied with a vigorous laugh as he started bragging. “The five of the nodes lacked proper support, allowing me to reverse the flow easily,” he explained, which, once again, was accompanied by that concentrated delivery of information. </p><p>A mistake. One that paid off well. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 360; Insult Bonus - 460 (Capped)]</p><p>[820x Return - Five Tigers Formation Technique - Beginner, Perfection]</p><p>“Impossible,” I shouted even as I flared the Qi from the spiritual vein, using the distraction to activate the reward once more. The information flooded my mind even as he laughed in victory, unaware that I had just turned into an even bigger expert in the technique he had just displayed. </p><p>Though, to my disappointment, it turned out to be a merely Golden Core technique instead of a Nascent Soul one. </p><p>It was a great improvement to my current abilities, on that, I had no doubt. Too bad it hadn’t surpassed Perfection. Not that it mattered immediately. I could always recycle it later, and it wasn’t like I planned to use it at the moment. </p><p>It was much better for them to think that formations were my weakness rather than my strength. </p><p>I tried to build another formation, hoping to bait another lesson, but it seemed that my earlier display had changed things. “That’s enough playing,” he said. “Attack.” </p><p>“You angered me thoroughly,” I said even as I rushed forward, to meet the challenge. Without my ability to see the weaknesses of the battle formation, it would have been a violent, desperate battle that pushed me to the limit even as I used every single advantage I had, including the spiritual pillar tree. </p><p>Instead, I merely had to deliver several disguised punches before the golden core cultivators started vomiting blood. </p><p>The battle formation was like a tank, impressively destructive, but extremely vulnerable to an attack from a weak spot. And, with my expertise already in Perfection, all I could see was weakness. Weakness that  I could destroy with simple disguised punches. </p><p>“Impossible,” the Nascent Soul cultivator gasped in fear as he started back to the ship. I was glad to let him do so, more than happy to take a draw, as for my purposes, it counted as a victory. I might have had a different idea if I believed the giant ship was the limit of their power, but it clearly was not. </p><p>Destroying the ship would make an enemy I wasn’t ready to make. </p><p>I said nothing as the skies transformed once again in a way that I recognized as teleportation formation, confident that the Nascent Soul cultivator was doing the smart thing, and retreating. </p><p>Which was why, I was surprised to see another, smaller flying boat drop down instead. </p><p>I tensed. I had misread the situation. And, it had the potential to be a costly mistake. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Even as the ship started to gather the power for an intense blow, I took a deep breath, preparing to build several formations if needed if they chose to attack with too much power. The power gathered for merely a second before being released. </p><p>It was an intense ray of light, almost pure Qi. It was also not as strong as I expected, merely double the strength of the one that they used to attack me when I had first come across them in misty mountains. </p><p>It was still a formidable attack, but the difference between the two attacks was nothing compared to the changes I had developed in the process. My body was brimming with power, enough that I was confident that I could resist the attack with my physical body and survive. </p><p>Not that I did that, of course. Just because I was stronger didn’t mean that I turned stupid. Trying to resist the attack was not only ridiculous, but also it would go a long way to ruin the sense of invincibility I was trying to build. </p><p>If I wanted to resist, I had a much better option in terms of the defensive formation. The attack had been scary when I was in a personalized flying boat — which, despite its Black rank quality, was still a Qi Gathering level artifact — but not when I was protected by a formation that was supported by a spirit vein. </p><p>But, I didn’t rely on that defense passively either. Instead, I responded with a gentle palm attack, one that resonated with the formation in a subtle way to enhance the attack. The intense light had circled around me, only to smash against the ship, targeting the barely fixed damaged section. </p><p>The defenses didn’t hold up, and a great gap shattered. </p><p>As the crew froze in shock, the flying boat sent five more attacks, every single one sent back with equal ease. I stayed floating, not following up with an attack, like I was amused by their attempts. “How quaint,” I declared with amusement. </p><p>The attack was impressive, but I just needed to interact with it a few times to catch its weaknesses, the biggest being the lack of control. It wasn’t an easy thing to reverse the attack of a cultivator, as the subdued Qi had followed their commands even outside their body. </p><p>The Qi cannon the ship was using didn’t have that, allowing me to manipulate it with ease. </p><p>My attitude made the Nascent Soul cultivator inside even angrier. “Attack,” he shouted, his voice twisting in fury. </p><p>However, he stayed on the ship, confirming my earlier guess about the Nascent Soul cultivators not being able to act with ease. I wanted to ponder about it more, but that decision was taken away from me in the form of several rays of light jumping outside the ship, turning into Golden Core cultivators. </p><p>The attacking cultivators came in two forms. One group was collected from the various sects as indicated by their robes, joining the initial twenty attackers, and raising their numbers to fifty. The second group was clad in ornate armor showing the sign of Treasure Pavilion, each one exuding a formidable presence that surpassed the others. </p><p>No wonder they were able to intimidate the other sects if they could employ cultivators of such strength. </p><p>The armored cultivators spread between the others, Qi gathering around them as they turned into a battle formation. I prepared myself to be rushed, but they did not. </p><p>Instead, another figure floated forward, an old man who was wearing an even fancier robe signaling that he was a part of the Treasure Pavilion. But, a glance at him was enough to show Providence dancing around him far more intensely. </p><p>No, dancing was not the right word. Prowling was a better idea. It was a complicated, messy battle, where Providence of his own was fighting hard to keep him concealed from the heavens. </p><p>He also looked exhausted, showing that whatever he did earlier took an intense toll on him. No wonder he was that angry. “I’ll make you regret standing in front of me,” he growled in fury. </p><p>“Really, little merchant,” I responded in a way that would make him truly furious. Everything I had seen about the cultivators showed that they truly disdained merchants, to the point that calling them truly angered him. “You think the pathetic pawns you have here would allow you to stand against your betters,” I added. </p><p>My taunting was not without a reason. At this point, a battle was inevitable, but the Nascent Soul cultivator seemed to be still confident of his victory. Angry and confident was a good way to get some ideas. </p><p>“You think your meager power makes you invincible in this pathetic lower world,” he shouted even as the Golden Core cultivators formed around him to turn into a devastating weapon of battle. “You will regret it if you don’t kneel down and apologize.” </p><p>I laughed at his words, hoping that it would prompt him to reveal more. His calling this place a lower world was alone valuable information, one that I theorized but lacked confirmation. </p><p>My understanding of the conflict between the two Providence twisted into a new understanding, but not just due to his words. Earlier, during my breakthrough, the burst of power had distinctly come from the depths of the earth, while his attempt to punish me had come from the sky. Combined with the way he dismissed this ‘world’ and the old information about the cultivators suddenly appearing, it made sense. </p><p>The old martial artists' records didn’t have any record of cultivators, because they hadn’t existed in this world beforehand. </p><p>Then, I made another connection. Cultivators didn’t belong to just one other world, but many worlds. Admittedly, it was more of a wild connection, but that assumption was based on the way the System worked. Everything it provided to me, including the martial arts, it was based on the perspective of the cultivators. </p><p>Meanwhile, the ancient martial arts didn’t even register. </p><p>Of course, that raised many questions about the real source of the System, which could be some kind of weapon that was developed by high-ranking cultivators, or a weapon by another world, targeting cultivators. But, that question, I left the wayside and focused on my enemy. </p><p>“Why, because your little pathetic battle formation is too threatening?” I said, looking dismissive. “I can shatter it with a mere breath. I can see every single weakness that the pathetic structure has.” </p><p>However, I was bluffing. Battle formations were different than actual formations despite the name. It was better to call them collaborative cultivation techniques more than anything else, using the coordination of many elements to create impenetrable defense and overwhelming attacks. </p><p>“What a terrible attempt to lie. To think that you can see through the ever-changing nature of the Treasured Golden Army formation? Preposterous.” </p><p>I paused for a moment, hoping for a trigger from the System. There was none, meaning that the explanation was too short to trigger a response from the System. It was bad. But, I decided to take another risk. “You think I can’t see it? What a sad misconception of a man who had never met a true genius,” I responded, feeling absurd. I had seen the other cultivators posturing from time to time, but I hadn’t been planning to be done. “How about a bet?” </p><p>“What bet?” he said. </p><p>“That I can point every little weakness in your pathetic battle formation, of course,” I said. </p><p>“And, if you can’t?” </p><p>“I’ll cut my own head. I swear on my ancestors,” I replied proudly. It meant nothing to me, of course, but the nascent soul cultivator flinched. They seemed to care a lot about their family reputation … that, or they were afraid that one of them was actually alive and return to punish them. </p><p>Either way, it seemed to be enough to trigger him. “You think you can see the ever-changing nature of its surface, allowing me to combine the power of every single cultivator to a single point in perfect elemental harmony!” he added, dismissive. “What a pathetic statement for a Nascent Soul cultivator.” </p><p>He was right. Unfortunately, in his anger, he let control of his cultivation. The explanation he had was equally short, but his loosened control meant that his words conveyed a rough impression of the technique, not unlike a jade slip. </p><p>It was a small mistake. Unfortunately for him, I had the System to compound that mistake several times.</p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 360; Insult Bonus - 460 (Capped)]</p><p>[820x Return - Treasured Golden Army Battle Formation - Beginner, Perfection]</p><p>I just needed to decide whether triggering it was worth the risk of alerting him, or it was better to taunt him further. </p>",

    "content": "<p>As they left the dungeon for an aerial scouting trip, I flicked open the notebook, my fingers brushing over the cramped handwriting. It was clearly not written by someone who was concerned with precision … or any kind of order. </p><p>The notebook was filled with half-complete sentences, random observations, and weird formulas. I was glad that Maria’s earlier explanation had given me some kind of a basis, or I might have just skipped all of the relevant sections. </p><p>However, as I read, I couldn’t help but frown. In many places, I could see the references to the connection with the dungeon staying weak and controlled, even with a few sentences that implied that the weak connection significantly limited the potential connection with the dungeon. </p><p>But, as he described the way it worked, I couldn’t help but close my eyes, and focus inwards to create the simple rotating feeling from Meditation, which didn’t count as a part of the no-experimentation rule, as I had repeated that trick thousands of times. </p><p>I repeated it, simply because the pain I felt from Maria’s botched attempt was very similar to what I felt when I botched Meditation while trying to reverse it … at least, the first portion. The Health damage was absent, but then I hadn’t let mana loose in my body. </p><p>“This isn’t experimentation, just observation,” I muttered, though I was glad I didn’t need to explain it to them. I had a feeling they wouldn’t appreciate the distinction I was making. </p><p>I carefully examined the surface for any imperfections, but there were none. However, as I examined it more and more, I finally felt something. </p><p>A direct connection to the center of the sphere. </p><p>“That can’t be good,” I said even as I mentally touched the bond for a fleeting second. The bond felt faint … but it wasn’t weak. It was like touching one of the invasive weeds with twenty feet of root into the ground. </p><p>I ignored the temptation to touch it more, and opened my eyes. “The connection is … intense,” I muttered, glad that we didn’t try to cut it easily. I had a feeling that it wouldn’t do any good. </p><p>However, I had a feeling that I was already beyond the method described in the book. The unfortunate mage’s method had taken great care to avoid the deeper connection, emphasizing the importance of keeping the bond weak, keeping it as one way as possible.</p><p>I couldn’t say I blamed him, especially since, across all the notes, he treated the dungeons as an extremely dangerous and volatile entity, and rightfully so. I still didn’t have any idea about where the dungeons came from, but anything that casually violated the rules of time and space couldn’t be something trivial. </p><p>Not even in a world where magic was commonplace. </p><p>“I have a feeling I have to look for something more permanent,” I muttered. It was a baseless statement, more of a hypothesis born out of sudden inspiration than anything else. </p><p>I flipped to another passage, reading about how he planned on using pillars of mana to stabilize the temporary connection, hoping to find some inspiration. As I read, I was glad that Maria had dealt with it first. The notebook didn’t have a coherent approach, and without the notes she scribbled on the sides, using my notation, I would have required months to properly decipher what was going on. </p><p>I didn’t bother with the calculations, trusting her to do them better than me, and instead focused on the core, repeating principles of control, containment, and caution. </p><p>I leaned back, tapping my finger against the notebook’s edge. The logic was sound, but it was built on a foundation of a temporary approach. It was clear that he saw the connection as something negative, something to be dismissed once the dungeon was breached. </p><p>“I just hope that it means a permanent connection is a good idea without that need,” I muttered. It was a bit of a stretch, but it implied that the technique was initially designed for a more permanent connection which was modified by his destructive usage. </p><p>It was not exactly an incredible piece of evidence, but considering the bond was already in place with no idea on how to sever it, I chose to believe it. </p><p>Flipping back to the earlier sections of the notebook, I scanned the notes on the initial bonding process, this time focusing more on Maria’s notes to better understand how to regulate the connection between the individual and the dungeon. </p><p>I sighed even as I started taking my own notes.  Unfortunately, those notes were less about clever adjustments and solutions, and more like a long list of questions I would ask Maria. </p><p>“It’s time to switch,” I muttered at one point, and instead opened Maria’s sealed notes about her meditation technique. Her notes were far more impressive than the ramblings of the enemy mage, especially since she had gone through enough effort to write everything based on our shared notation system. </p><p>It was a far more acceptable challenge, even though I sincerely doubted I could actually apply even a part of those transformations to my own abilities. Maria could use them, because she had both the skill and Intelligence to guide her. </p><p>In their current form, it was impossible to implement them. “But, that doesn’t mean that there’s no alternative method,” I muttered even as I started working on the formulas, trying to find a more generalized expression. </p><p>The only reason I even dared to do it was that math was still holding up as a universal constant. Unfortunately, considering I didn’t know how it held up at the extremes, some of my favorite methods, like proof by contradiction or induction, were not available. </p><p>In the end, I found myself mostly relying on constructive proof, which was to create a wider expression, before going back to check if it worked for every unique formula she had provided. Which, even with my familiarity with high-level mathematics, was not exactly easy. </p><p>I never liked constructive proofs, as they were usually not ‘elegant’, a word that every doctorate student of mine hated. Also, finding the right construction was never trivial. Sometimes, it took weeks to come up with a valid construction, and then it took months to prove that generalization held true… </p><p>“At least, it’s not proof of exhaustion,” I muttered. It was one method I was happy not to be using. </p><p>However, the more I worked, the more I found myself lost in various topological transformations. Ultimately, the practical applications of mana were utterly reliant on mana. Of course, Maria’s constructions were always focused on three dimensions, but it was hardly the only way. </p><p>I found out that inventing extra dimensions to resolve those structures was surprisingly stable. At least, at the first glimpse. Actually solving them was not exactly something I could achieve. Maybe, if I could prove that Group Theory holds correctly… </p><p>“What about ...” I muttered even as my pencil started to dance on the paper with sudden inspiration: a formula to reconcile the flow of mana with the higher-dimensional theories that theoretical physics loved so much. </p><p>It was so tempting to try. I might have even ignored my promise if it wasn’t for the excruciating pain I felt when Maria managed to take over the dungeon. I was still reluctant to put a name to it, but it was clear that Meditation and Dungeon Connection relied on the same thing. </p><p>And, I almost killed myself trying to reverse the direction of Meditation in the past. Trying to somehow project it with more dimensions than we could perceive didn’t seem like a good idea. </p><p>“But, creating a denser mana structure is different,” I muttered as I suddenly went back to the generalized solution for the dense mana I had created for my skill. If I combined the two, there was a chance that it could help me create another, stronger variant of epic alloys. </p><p>One that could potentially unlock the next stage of the skill. </p><p>I began to trace in the air, trying to envision the idea in a way that was more than just a formula. A mere n-cube alone, even as its most common expression as a tesseract was not trivial, and I didn’t dare to actually form that as a core for my meditation. </p><p>However, the principle idea was very simple. A two-dimensional cube was merely a square, and a three-dimensional one was an ordinary cube. A tesseract was a four-dimensional cube. </p><p>Mathematical properties were easy to define. Where a cube had eight vertices, a tesseract had sixteen. A cube had twelve edges, whereas a tesseract had thirty-two. A cube had six faces, whereas a tesseract had twenty-four. </p><p>Unfortunately, trying to imagine it as an actual construct was far more difficult. </p><p>“I feel like a poor student,” I muttered even as I tried to tangle with the idea, like some of the visual learners did in more complicated undergraduate math classes, only to learn that, without the abstraction the mathematics provided, some of those concepts were plain impossible to comprehend. </p><p>Too bad merely experimenting on the idea would have likely killed me. I returned to the safe world of formulas and abstractions, once again hunting for a more generalized solution —</p><p>Only for my thoughts to be interrupted when Maria burst into the dungeon, her clothes ripped and bloody, not even bothering to step down from her griffin. And, it was sooner than I expected. </p><p>My eyes widened. </p><p>It was clearly not good news. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“… So,” I muttered after a long silence, during which we stared at the book on the ground, radiating a disgusting yet dangerous feeling like I came face to face with a monster I could not fight back against. “I’m guessing we’re not touching that.” </p><p>“Depends on what we find in the notebook,” Maria answered. “I want to burn it completely, but …” </p><p>“We can’t take the risk, not when the notebook could be empty. Do you want to do the honors?” I said. </p><p>“Really, do you want me to read? I thought you would argue to be the first one.” </p><p>“If we weren’t operating under a very tight restriction, I might have done exactly that,” I said. “Under the circumstances, I’m happy to temporarily limit myself to second-hand information,” I said. Technically third-hand, as that notebook looked more like a personal collection than anything else. </p><p>She gave me a small smile as she opened the notebook, flipping through the pages with a speed that was impossible for me to match. More than two hundred pages, and she finished it in less than five minutes, and most of that time was spent taking notes on the margins. When she raised her head, her thoughtful expression didn’t give much away. However, watching her grab the corrupted book and place it back in the satchel was promising. </p><p>“Good news?” I asked. </p><p>“Better than I feared,” she said. “Apparently, the book only describes how to break the dungeon gates, and not how to open new ones. We don’t need to touch it for the moment.” </p><p>“And, how about the dungeon gates?” I asked. </p><p>She paused. “That’s a bit more problematic. He’s not a good note-taker, and I have a feeling that whoever taught him did a bad job in the first place. But, he has the core methods written down.” </p><p>“And,” I asked. </p><p>She smiled. “The biggest part is to create an alignment with the dungeon by killing the boss monsters,” she said. “Apparently, one needs to kill multiple boss monsters to establish a preliminary connection, before establishing a contact through various magical conduits.” </p><p>“Conduits?” I asked. </p><p>“Simple mana constructs, and he had descriptions of them. They have several fail safes to keep the connection limited, which seems to be an important part of what he was focusing on. But, why, he doesn’t go into so much detail.” </p><p>“Maybe it causes some kind of backlash while breaking the dungeon,” I said. “Or, it’s only possible to connect with one dungeon.” </p><p>“Probably,” she said even as she raised her hand, and a very complicated pillar of mana appeared. </p><p>“Wait! Are you going to do it immediately? We only have a few notes from the notebook. It’s too risky,” I said. </p><p>“As risky as sending you to an unknown dungeon as a scout with no support, where you fought with an army just to escape,” she countered as she continued to build the very complicated mana structure, one that I couldn’t even begin to imagine building unassisted, rotating and shifting. </p><p>“Good point,” I admitted. I wanted to argue more, but she was not only determined, but also it was far closer to her expertise. “If you think the risks are acceptable, go ahead.” </p><p>“They are,” she said. “The notes are clear that an unclaimed dungeon is easy to take over as long as two or three dungeon bosses have been slain. Since I have killed about a dozen, it should work perfectly —” </p><p>She was interrupted by a deep scream, one that I realized was coming from me. The moment her mana structure sank into the ground, a sharp pain hit my whole being, forcing a cry. I never remembered feeling something this intense. </p><p>As if something was being ripped out from my whole soul. </p><p>When I stopped trembling, I found both Eleanor and Maria hovering above me, signaling that it had been a while. “What happened?” Eleanor said. </p><p>“I don’t know,” Maria said, panicked. “I was trying to connect with the dungeon, but he cried in pain.” </p><p>“I … I think I know,” I muttered, barely able to whisper. “But, just to remove my doubts, do you mind explaining how the connection with the dungeon works in simple terms.” </p><p>“From what I could understand, the absorbed boss crystal works as some kind of guidance, allowing the recognition from the dungeon, while the mana pillar works as a way to connect with it. However, the notes were clear that more pillars were required to make more complicated changes.” </p><p>“And, only one person could bond with a dungeon?” I asked. </p><p>“Yes,” Maria nodded, quick to catch up where I was leading. “You think you already started the process?” </p><p>I nodded. “It looks that way.” </p><p>“But, the notes are pretty clear on the next steps of bonding with a dungeon. It requires a lot of very careful meditation, one that relies on a very specific way to meditate while using the pillar as a channel. The multitasking it requires is enough to challenge me. Not something that could be done accidentally.” </p><p>“Even if someone absorbed more than fifty dungeon boss crystals, raised a veritable forest across multiple floors, absorbed thousands of shells, and then went ahead and slept in the dungeon continuously.” </p><p>As I counted, Maria frowned. “Maybe,” she muttered. ”I can easily imagine the trees functioning somewhat similar to the mana pillars, especially with the way they affect the dungeon mist. The notes are clear that the number of boss crystals absorbed makes the process easier. And, as for sleep…” </p><p>“They had been filled with weird dreams since I absorbed the boss crystals, and I slept longer. I was willing to write it off as mere exhaustion, but...” </p><p>“The timing of your pain is conclusive,” Maria said. “We need to find a way to fix it,” she said. </p><p>“Do we?” I asked. </p><p>Maria frowned. “Of course we do. It’s a complete unknown, and too risky to be left untouched.” </p><p>“And, do we have any idea how to safely separate it now that I used thousands of trees instead of carefully designed mana pillars?” I countered. </p><p>“You can’t be serious,” Maria growled. </p><p>“What does he want?” Eleanor interrupted. </p><p>“He wants to deepen his connection with the dungeon,” Maria commented. “It’s madness.” </p><p>I sighed. “Look, the last thing I want is to experiment on myself. But, we have no idea how to separate it safely, and I doubt that we could afford to purchase that information.” She looked ready to argue. “Just answer me. True or not?” </p><p>“True,” she said reluctantly. </p><p>“And, the way I reacted shows that a fragile bond is a weakness that could potentially be leveraged easily.” </p><p>“Also true,” she said, this time in resignation. “But, what you’re proposing is a complete unknown, and too risky to be left untouched. We have no idea what kind of influence the dungeon might exert on you through an unregulated connection.” </p><p>“Unlike your experiment, where we were perfectly aware of what would have happened?” I countered. </p><p>“Wait! What?” Eleanor interrupted, looking at Maria angrily. “I thought we agreed on being careful. What’s with you two? I was away for only an hour.” </p><p>I raised my hands in surrender. “In my defense, I had no idea that sleeping in the dungeon would result in such a dangerous side effect.” </p><p>It was a good point, but Eleanor didn’t seem to be ready to accept it. “Doesn’t matter. You need to be more careful,” she ordered. I nodded sheepishly. “Now, what are we going to do?” she said. </p><p>Maria paused for a moment, her expression twisting like she had just eaten something foul. “I hate to admit it, but it looks like he has a point. He has already bonded with the dungeon somewhat, and breaking it would be unnecessarily risky. Reinforcing the connection in a more controlled manner seems like a better idea.” </p><p>Eleanor looked ready to argue, but I had no intention of backing down. “I understand the risks, Eleanor, but think about what we’re dealing with here. I’ve already been connected to the dungeon, whether by accident or through my actions. And, with the danger of their assault getting closer and closer, we don’t have a real choice.”</p><p>“We don’t even know that there’s going to be an attack now that we have discovered their plans. Maybe they will just pull back. I want to scout the dungeon entrance myself. That way, we will know if it was broken or not.” </p><p>“A fair offer,” I accepted. It was more than fair. After that horrible pain, I wasn’t enthusiastic about the attack, but the prospect of another attack like that was even scarier. I could do my best to defend the first floor, but recent events had shown that we didn’t know enough about the dungeons to properly understand what was going on. </p><p>“I’ll come with you,” Maria said. Eleanor looked ready to argue, but Maria waved her finger. “No, if there’s a break, I need to be there to restrain their aura,” she added. “The flame nature goes both ways.” </p><p>Eleanor nodded in acceptance. “No experimenting while we’re gone,” she said. </p><p>“Deal,” I replied as I nodded. “I’ll just read the notebook to get a better sense of what was going on.” But, just as they turned, I also pulled the sealed letter from Maria, one in which she had written the secrets of her meditation art into. “And, maybe this as well. I have a feeling the insights will come useful.” </p><p>Maria looked torn in indecision, but after a while, she sighed. “I see your point,” she grudgingly admitted. “But, no experimenting before I return. On either.”  </p><p>“I promise,” I said, which I meant completely. The pain I felt earlier was a good enough reason for me to be dissuaded. </p>",

    "content": "<p>As Maria worked on her magic, I started examining my own creation, hoping to find a way to replicate it. The only problem was that, I didn’t have an idea where to start. “Do you mind helping me for a second,” I asked. </p><p>“If you think it’s more important than the contents of the satchel.” </p><p>“Potentially, yes,” I said. “I need your opinion on how the special effect works. Maybe we can replicate it.” </p><p>“Fine,” she said. “Give me a minute so I can stabilize the enchantment,” she said, and suddenly, the mana web around the enchantment started rotating, giving me the impression of the world’s most confusing puzzle. </p><p>I wasn’t even sure whatever going on was limited to three dimensions. Just looking at it made me dizzy. </p><p>“Now, what’s the problem?” she said once she put the satchel down. </p><p>“The recipe for the initial creation of items is obvious. The monster material gives us the main concept, while the dungeon crystal stabilizes the effect,” I explained even as I slowly forged another piece of metal, though I used the shells in order not to waste my limited stock of materials. </p><p>“Most of it, I can’t really understand. Whatever that’s going inside is too complicated,” she said. “Do you have a method to describe the process like you do with mana flow?” she asked. </p><p>“No,” I said. “Unlike mana flows, there’s too many changes going on with the metal, and I don’t even know where to start.”</p><p> “Can you at least repeat the process in the open, without the metal so I can watch it directly. That way, maybe I can see what’s going on.” </p><p>I paused, remembering my own attempts, which had ended pretty uselessly. A small corrosive field explosion, covering a space as much as my fist.  </p><p>“Not very impressive, is it?” she said. I shrugged. “Do you think it can be weaponized?”  </p><p>“Maybe,” I admitted. “It’s certainly something to work on, once we have a few weeks we can work on it leisurely. Having armor-destroying grenades might be useful. But, before finding new uses, let’s focus on our current problem.” </p><p>She nodded. I continued to repeat the effort, while she cast several spells around, some increasing the destabilization, while the others slowed it down. “It’s too difficult,” she admitted. “But, I feel it’s more conceptual than structural.” </p><p>“Meaning, we need Wisdom to deal with it?” I said, remembering her last explanation about Meditation. </p><p>“Probably. At least, I need a better framework to understand what’s going on.” </p><p>“But, you think it can be stabilized without the crystal?” She nodded. “And, would you work better if we work on something you’re more familiar with?” </p><p>“You’re talking about the claws,” she said. “It’ll be easier, that much is certain,” she admitted. “Unfortunately, easier doesn’t mean it can be achievable easily.” </p><p>“No harm trying,” I said. </p><p>“Even if it wastes material,” she said. </p><p>“It’s not like we have enough to be useful in any case,” I said. “Trying to figure out how to forge without crystals is more valuable.” </p><p>She paused for a moment before her eyes widened. “Because if the breach happens, we will have a supply of claws, but not the crystals,” she said. </p><p>“Exactly,” I said even as I raised one of the claws, and essentially repeated the forging process without any metal. Just like the corrosion effect, it flared, turning into a tiny fireball. She frowned, but her focus was too intense for me to interrupt. </p><p>For a minute, she said nothing before she raised her hand. “Repeat it,” she said. I did so again and again, not saying anything even as we depleted all the crystal. Luckily, that still left some claws to work with. Once finished, she closed her eyes, no doubt going through calculations. </p><p>“Alright, I think I can stabilize it without a crystal,” she said. “But, try to keep it not as intense.” </p><p>It was a good thing that we had already worked on how to forge together. It meant that, it didn’t take long for us to adapt the mana flow she had in mind into something workable. It was nothing compared to figuring out how to handle epic-grade forging. </p><p>Ten minutes later, I was looking at a plate with a warm center as my spell hit. “Failure?” I asked. </p><p>“No, it dispersed the effect, just not as strong,” she commented. “Not as good as I had hoped…” </p><p>“Still good enough to make arrowheads,” I said. “And, we can still improve it.” </p><p>“Do you want to try again?” she said as she pointed at the last two claws. </p><p>“No, I want to work on it first. Do you mind writing the formula for how you stabilized it?” </p><p>“Like how I did for the dense mana?” she asked. I nodded. “My pleasure,” she said, and quickly scribbled it. While she returned to work on the satchel, I started examining the formula, and comparing it with the generalized epic formula I had derived. </p><p>It was not easy, especially since the formulas I had been using were mostly random effects. On a theoretical level, math seemed to be absolute and consistent even when magic was factored in, proving its role as a universal constant for science. </p><p>Though, I had a feeling that I was already pushing the limits of basic Euclidian math. Just like how we had to leverage Riemann Geometry to solve general relativity problems, or Quantum theory required a completely novel approach, mana seemed to require its unique methodology to solve it. </p><p>And, that was not something that could be resolved easily. Luckily, for the problems I had been working on, the disgusting abomination of Euclidean geometry, mixed with various other methods worked well enough. It was not robust, but it was workable. Too bad the bastardized version was enough to annoy even an undergraduate student.  </p><p>While Maria worked on her part, I worked mostly with pen and paper to model theoretically, occasionally switching the mana to see if I was on the right path. The pile of paper in front of me started to grow larger and larger as I did my best to put her observations about the flame-stabilizer structure — as I had decided to call them temporarily — together as I repeated the same method again and again. </p><p>The experiments would have been much easier if I had a large pile of claws, but even without it, I wasn’t helpless. </p><p>I did my best to search for a more ‘elegant’ mathematical solution, the favorite pastime of theoretical physics that most other disciplines loved to tease them about. </p><p>But, now that I was facing a dearth of materials and a tight deadline, their method had benefits. I even took a few breaks, casting a few flame spells through a tight tube to watch the way the flame spells moved, the observation allowing me to catch some observations. </p><p>Turning these observations into generalized formulas like Maria did was not something I could do without Intelligence — or a computer — but validating the results was much simpler. </p><p>At least, while mana was complicated, and unruly, it seemed to follow its core principles perfectly. I leaned over the papers, trying to peel back the layers from the formula to develop a more coherent approach. </p><p>As I fell into the pattern of scribbling notes, experimenting, and refining the formulas, the dungeon gate started to show movement. The rest of the farmers, under the leadership of Harold, had arrived at the dungeon. Though, unlike the volunteers, they were moving to the outpost on the first floor. </p><p>Their orderly movement suggested that my presence was not necessary, so I happily continued to work on my problem, trying to come up with a more generalized differential equation for stabilizing spells. </p><p>However, as I worked, I was glad that I wasn’t trying to find a perfect solution, but a good enough one, just enough to register with the Forge skill so it could handle the rest. “Maybe if I transform them into a smooth manifold —” I muttered, feeling that I was close. </p><p>Only to be interrupted by a cheer from Maria. “Finally,” she called. I looked at her, amused by her cheer. “Well, the enchantment is finally dealt with,” Maria called. “How about your side?” </p><p>“I have an idea, but I need your assistance. Do you mind if we try that before we open the satchel? I have a feeling that whatever is in it will distract us.” </p><p>She nodded. Luckily, she was familiar with my notation enough that processing my conclusion only took a minute. She sent another line of mana as I forged, embedding the claw into another alloy sheet. One that managed to disperse my Fire Bolt almost perfectly. </p><p>“More than workable,” I said as I caressed the metal, my heart beating as I realized what it could solve. It held answers to not just our current dungeon break, but all of them. </p><p>“This has potential,” Maria said, smiling. </p><p>Unfortunately, the moment my gaze fell on the satchel, I felt my enthusiasm evaporate. “It would have been more exciting if we didn’t just learn that at least some of the dungeon breaks are artificially induced,” I said. </p><p>“True,” she said while she reached for the satchel. There were multiple skill stones there, their glow showing that they were likely Epic. She put them to the side, which I didn’t blame her for. They weren’t that interesting, and neither was the money pouch or other sundry. </p><p>There were two things that caught our attention. One was a handwritten notebook, looking like personal notes. </p><p>The other was a leather book that she threw the moment her fingers touched it. Any other time, I would have gotten angry at the treatment of the books, but this one, I was willing to make an exception. Even from a distance, I could feel a subtle yet disgusting sensation radiating off of it. </p><p>One that reminded me of the same energy that was being used to destroy the dungeon gate… </p><p></p>",

    "content": "<p>“Welcome back,” Eleanor said even as she pulled the box open, and I once again found myself in the dungeon. </p><p>“Thanks,” I replied, then took a deep breath, finally feeling safe now that I was in a location where I had the absolute advantage. Though, the irony of feeling like that in a dungeon was rather amusing. “It has been … an interesting journey.” </p><p>“How interesting?” Eleanor asked.</p><p>“Not much. I was lucky enough that they weren’t very well organized. Once I rolled a few burning logs, they were so sure that Maria was attacking them, they scattered in chaos, allowing me to go in and out with minimal fuss.”  </p><p>I could see that they wanted to talk about the minute details relating to my safety, but after everything I had seen, focusing on the implications was more critical than discussing the unimportant details of my escape. “So, do you want the bad news first, or the horrible ones?” </p><p>“That bad?” Maria asked. I nodded. “Let’s just start from just bad before moving to horrible.” </p><p>“Fine. The dungeon creatures are resistant to heat. It didn’t even register the presence of a Flame Bolt.” </p><p>“That’s hardly a spell,” Eleanor commented. “I’m sure they can’t resist Maria’s attacks.” </p><p>“True, but it was just the weakest monster. The stronger ones will be even stronger when it comes to that.” </p><p>Eleanor paused. “It doesn’t make sense. If the dungeon is about to break, you can’t just encounter the weakest monsters on the first floor.” </p><p>“She’s right,” Maria said, but her tone lacked the relief Eleanor showed. “But, I’m guessing that part relates to the horrible part of the news.” </p><p>“Exactly,” I said. “Whoever is supporting Thomas is more influential than we think. They have arranged for someone to manipulate and modify the dungeon.” Maria’s eyes widened as I gave her a summary of the salient points, the dungeon's nature, the two entrances to the dungeon, and his attempts to shatter the gate. </p><p>“You can’t be serious,” Eleanor gasped. “I didn’t even think that dungeons could have multiple gates leading outside.” </p><p>“Neither did I,” Maria said. “The team we called only adjusted the internal gates. Are you sure that it led outside?” </p><p>“Most likely,” I admitted. “I didn’t check it, but every other detail looked that way. Not to mention, the way Thomas appeared lends credence to it. But, we can find out,” I said, and removed the satchel from the bag. “I managed to pick it up while retreating. His personal bag.” </p><p>“How?” Maria asked. “The team we called to modify our family dungeon acted like they would defend their secrets with their lives.” </p><p>“Well, he kind of … did,” I said. </p><p>“Devon,” Eleanor said, her tone suddenly sharp. “I distinctly remember you saying that you went in and out with minimal fuss merely a minute ago. Fighting against a mage is not a minimal fuss.” </p><p>“It wasn’t a fight,” I said. “I was running away from the dungeon just as he was trying to retreat inside. He was already exhausted from whatever he was doing, and his bodyguards were positioned to defend against the attacks from the outside. He tried to rely on his magical defenses, and they failed against my mana attack.” </p><p>“And, your escape afterward,” Maria said, catching on my deflection. </p><p>“Fine,” I muttered, realizing that trying to let them keep focused on the topic was only making them more determined to get the full details of the story. Admittedly, a part of me was glad for it. It had been a while since someone worried for me while ignoring the material benefits. </p><p>So, I told them the full story, from the initial distraction to how I escaped from the dungeon, though I still made sure to undersell just how close It had been to a total disaster, particularly where I escaped from the fortress, and how Thomas’ arrogance of flying letting me get away from a potentially deadly envelopment. </p><p>At the end of the story, Eleanor spoke. “There’s no individual adventure for you in the future. You can’t be trusted to take care of yourself,” Eleanor declared. Maria nodded seriously. </p><p>I nodded, seemingly accepting it. I wasn’t exactly burning with a desire for adventure in the first place, and if the situation required it, we could discuss it then. “We have more important topics,” I said even as I passed the satchel to Maria. “Do you mind seeing if you can break the magical defenses on it? It might have something valuable.” </p><p>“Sure,” Maria said, then closed her eyes. “Actually, it’s not a complicated one. Do you want me to teach you how to break it?”  </p><p>“I would have loved it, but we better not waste time,” I said even as I pulled the crystal and lizard claws from my bag. “I want to forge a metal to resist the heat aura of those beasts.” </p><p>“What’s the use?” Eleanor asked. “With that much, we can only forge a few swords. Maybe a set of armor at most.” </p><p>“Two things. First, it’s never a bad idea to confirm the usefulness of such an item. And, once we do it, we can try to reverse engineer to create that effect manually somewhat,” I said. </p><p>“And if we can’t,” Eleanor asked. </p><p>“Then we can see if we can purchase anything that has the same ability from a similar dungeon, and having a sample will still help. At worst, we’ll know raiding the dungeon for some extra material will be a valuable strategy.” </p><p>“Are you mad?” Eleanor said. “You just escaped there. Do you want to return there?” </p><p>“Oh, believe me, that’s the last thing I want,” I replied. “But, I don’t want to see the people of the town being burned alive by the presence of the monsters even less. I just fought against a weak monster, and it managed to hurt me despite my armor. I don’t need to see to know how the guards will fare against them.” </p><p>That silenced Eleanor for a moment. “Fine,” she grumbled in frustration. </p><p>We fell silent, and I focused fully on the forging process. It was too similar to forging anti-corrosive material. The parts from the beast carried the effect, and the dungeon crystal helped to stabilize it. </p><p>I sighed. If I had the necessary raw materials, I could have created enough armor and weapons to equip the whole town in less than a day. Unfortunately, that particular “if” was not something that was easy to solve. </p><p>It wasn’t like we could just go visit every dungeon and ask for their materials. Not when I suspected that doing so would create even more enemies. </p><p>“Is this it?” Eleanor asked as I passed the cooled-down material to her. </p><p>“I think so,” I said. “Do you mind putting it against the rock?” </p><p>“Just cast it, it’s not like your spell will hurt me,” she said. </p><p>I frowned. “Maybe, but it’s not a good habit to make the experiments any riskier than they have to be. Not when we’re literally playing with fire.” </p><p>Eleanor looked at me, but I had no intention of complying with her ideas. “Fine,” she said with a frown and put it on the ground, and when I gestured to her, she pulled back. Only when she was behind me, did I raise my hand and throw a Fire Bolt. </p><p>[-100 Mana]</p><p>One that had been dispersed an inch before it could even touch the metal. “See, no harm,” she said. </p><p>“Doesn’t matter,” I said even as I approached the metal, and touched it. The lack of damage was not surprising, as my sole magic spell was hardly an object of danger. I didn’t know if it was more about my limited Essence — which was pitiful when compared to Maria’s overwhelming numbers — or the low quality of the skill. </p><p>It was a question I wanted to answer, but with everything going on, I always had more important experiments. </p><p>Due to the limited impact of my spell, the lack of damage was not surprising. However, there wasn’t even a hint of damage, not even some heating up — which I would have identified with Observe. </p><p>It would likely resolve the impact of the dungeon monsters as smoothly as my anti-corrosive metal. Too bad its production was entirely reliant on dungeon material. If I had a sufficient amount of material, it would have taken me merely a day to create enough equipment for everyone in town. </p><p>Unfortunately, unlike anti-corrosive alloy, I didn’t have unlimited access to the necessary materials. I could probably fashion a sword or two, maybe a full set of armor at most, but it would be the limit of it. </p><p>However, I didn’t focus on that for the moment. Hopefully, Maria and I would be able to come up with a method if we cooperate properly. If not … Well, that was a topic for the future. </p><p>“… So, this is the metal that’s supposed to protect us against those flame lizards,” Eleanor said as she twirled the material in her hand. </p><p>“Yes. Hopefully, we will find a way to replicate it without dungeon materials now that the dungeon is not as big of a threat —” I started, only to freeze, and start cursing. </p><p>“What’s wrong?” Eleanor asked. </p><p>“I haven’t delayed the breaking of the dungeon for as long as I thought,” I said. </p><p>“What do you mean —” Maria intervened, before she gasped, her eyes widening. “I see,” she said, immediately catching what I was leading at. </p><p>“Spill it,” Eleanor said. </p><p>Maria spoke. “Rosie’s letter warned us that the dungeon would break in three days, but that likely assumed that it was a natural break. Since it was an external intervention, it will be shorter.” </p><p>“Not necessarily,” I intervened. “It’s possible that whatever he did to that dungeon entrance hastened it, but there’s a chance that it’ll take longer.” </p><p>“Don’t tell me you want to go there again?” Eleanor said. </p><p>“Hopefully, the answer is there,” I said even as I looked at the satchel in Maria’s hand, the enchantment half broken. Admittedly, I wasn’t sure it would be enough. Even assuming there was a conclusive answer in there, there was no guarantee that Thomas’ supporters wouldn’t just send someone else to break the dungeon. </p><p>“How long do you think it’ll take to break?” Eleanor asked.  </p><p>“Probably another hour,” Maria said. “The enchantment is simple, but a mistake is enough to destroy the contents. We can’t afford it.” </p><p>“True,” I said, then looked at Eleanor. “Maybe we evacuate the town into the dungeon as a precaution?” </p><p>“Do you think that’s necessary? We have invested a lot in the town. We can’t just abandon it.” </p><p>“At least, let’s evacuate the farmers, claiming that we discovered a way to make it more productive or something. We can leave the task to Harold, so it won’t be too suspicious. And, in case of an emergency, we can quickly level them up as well.” </p><p>Eleanor looked at Maria, who nodded. “Fine, we can do that,” Eleanor said. “I’ll inform Harold.” </p><p>She took off, leaving us to our tasks. </p>",

    "content": "<p>The moment I picked up my equipment, I rushed out, ready to cut a path. Behind me, I could see the four bodyguards trying to chase me, but it was clear that their full speed wasn’t enough to match mine. Without an obstruction, they wouldn’t be able to catch up with me. </p><p>Unfortunately for me, with an army positioned around the fortress, they had plenty of obstruction. If I could use the Floating Stride efficiently, I might have a hope of ditching them, but the last thing I needed was to end up rolling down the hill. </p><p>Similarly, trying to find a cave to somehow ditch the observers was not an option. I could conceal myself from them when I was at the peak of the mountain, and they were looking in the wrong direction for any possible visitor, but against people that were actively looking for me…</p><p>No, running in a straight line was the best option. </p><p>“Anyone that slows him down earns an Epic skill!” one of the guards shouted, which changed the attitude of the army significantly. Several people proved fast enough to cut my path, especially since their position was more favored. </p><p>Running around them was likely a better option than fighting, but killing them would have been a more intimidating option. I switched to my hammer even as I closed in the distance, Mana covering its surface. However, it wasn’t a blow of Quake Hammer, but Forge skill. </p><p>[-40 Mana]</p><p>One blow had been enough to distort and ruin the integrity of the armor, so the following Quake Hammer devastated his body. I didn’t know whether he was dead or alive. Either way, the visuals worked well. </p><p>Especially since the only thing that illuminated the valley was the ongoing forest fire I had triggered … was it five minutes ago, maybe even shorter. </p><p>“It’ll take a lot to get that Epic Skill!” I shouted as I continued to run forward, their hesitation was all I needed was to dash forward. Looking down, I could see that the bodyguards didn’t have the same mobility through the rocky surface. </p><p>For a moment, I thought that I would be getting away freely. Then, things changed. Everyone in the army paused for a moment.</p><p>It was too ominous for me to simply write it off. I pushed myself to run even faster, only for the people in the army to spread again, their sudden pattern of movement difficult to comprehend. Some of them moved to cut my path, while others took alternative paths to cover the gaps. </p><p>It was hard to describe, but it was as if I was playing a computer game, and I switched from easy to brutal. Even as I was trying to comprehend that, a distinct cry of a Griffin reached my ear. </p><p>Charisma, I realized even before I looked back, so it wasn’t a shock to see Thomas riding a griffin that had just burst out of the fortress. He wore a helmet, but his decorative armor was too distinctive for me to forget. </p><p>I knew it was a problem, but the full extent of it I only realized once the first three fastest soldiers caught up with me. Even as I smashed down one of them with my hammer, the other two rushed to tackle me, uncaring for their safety. </p><p>A kick threw one of them away, while a switch of direction enabled me to avoid the second. Unfortunately, even with the hammer attack caving half of his head, the third one managed to grab my leg. I switched to my sword, and a blow to the weak shoulder joint of the armor solved the issue, but not before the second wave caught up with me. </p><p>Reflexively, I slammed my hammer to the ground, triggering another landslide. </p><p>[-100 Health]</p><p>That created enough of a gap for me to ditch them, but a bigger part of the army was closing in. </p><p>I picked the least crowded part and continued to dash wildly toward the peak, I started to understand why people with Charisma had been treated like such a threat. The only thing that gave me even a fighting chance was the dispersed state of the army. </p><p>Otherwise, I would have hated to fight against even ten people who were ‘encouraged’ by Charisma. The perfect coordination and all the self-preservation instincts of a zombie were an overwhelming combination. </p><p>I continued to climb, glad that I was already out of their envelopment. Ten more seconds and my fate may not have been as bright. </p><p>Thomas must have also realized that, as suddenly, the army had lost their cohesion. Realizing what was about to happen, I immediately pulled one of the epic javelins I had prepared, pumped it with my remaining mana, and threw it at Thomas’ mount. </p><p>Just as I did that, a primal sense of terror hit me. It was hard to resist such pure and instinctual fear, when one’s body refused to listen to their orders. Luckily for me, I fought against a similar sensation whenever I stepped on a griffin, or used Floating Stride. </p><p>And, my phobia of flying was stronger. </p><p>I ran, refusing to allow the artificial fear of Charisma to have a hold on me, even if it slowed me down, and interfering with my ability to focus on the technique I had learned. </p><p>It seemed like he couldn’t use the two effects simultaneously, which made my life considerably easier. The shout from his griffin, filled with pain to confirm I had hit the target, encouraged me to run even faster. I refused to look back, as I doubted that I could handle the sight of someone trying to fly with an injured mount. </p><p>Unfortunately, Thomas’ pressure didn’t disappear even when the sound of hitting on the ground reached my ears. A glance back showed a bloody, unmoving griffin, proving that the attack worked, while Thomas’ figure was difficult to pick. </p><p>“Let’s add some more confusion,” I said as I staggered. I rapidly grew another extremely flammable tree, this time focusing on creating even more smoke, the farming tricks I had picked from the study group working wonders. </p><p>Some, I rolled down the hill. Some, I left burning in place, releasing plumes of smoke into the air, creating thick clouds that were impossible to see through. It turned out to be a good choice, as soon I heard the angry cries of several griffins, indicating that more reinforcements had arrived. </p><p>“What a trap,” I muttered as I reached the peak and continued to run in a straight line, stuffing my face with Health dense food. Giving into my arsonist tendencies and burning even more trees was fun. I had deliberately spread it at the cost of slowing down, as just one path of smoke was equally easy to follow. </p><p>However, as I did that, I wasn’t sure whether Thomas would dare to follow with his army out of position. He didn’t seem like a person who would brave the risk of facing a person who took down his griffin mount with just one attack with limited support.</p><p>If he was, he wouldn’t have run away with his tail between his legs during our earlier confrontation, where he accidentally reached the conclusion that I had broken through the level hundred barrier. </p><p>That assessment turned out to be true. He could have switched to one of the other griffins and chased me, but instead, the griffins were ridden by the four bodyguards and some scouts. </p><p>Unfortunately for them, the forest canopy was too thick to catch me, particularly in the middle of the night. They might have succeeded if the area lacked vegetation, or if it was still daytime, but their failure suggested that even Perception had its limits. </p><p>At least, with the amount they seemed to have. </p><p>Ditching them wasn’t too difficult. Trying to use griffins on a moonlit night was yet another tactical error, allowing me to pinpoint exactly where they were against the starry sky, allowing me to adjust my route. I was ready to take down their mounts with the javelins I had prepared, but luckily, it seemed to be unnecessary. </p><p>Once I got away from the mountains, I started encountering beasts, their aggression significantly more overwhelming during the night. Luckily, in a mana-dead location, they weren’t too dangerous. Some still managed to deliver hits that would have been devastating if it wasn’t for my armor, but even those merely caused a few scratches. </p><p>When I was sufficiently away, I had removed the disguise from the surface of the armor. </p><p>I had no idea whether they could follow me back to the town, and whether my little concealed trick would hold, but either way, I would lose nothing by trying that. </p><p>It was near dawn when I managed to return to the town. I didn’t go inside immediately. Instead, I moved to a nearby hill, and cast a Flame Bolt to the sky, a signal we had agreed upon with Maria … one of many. The flame bolt wasn’t the most urgent one, but it was close. </p><p>Maria and Eleanor appeared there a minute later. “You’re alright,” they declared happily. </p><p>I smiled, trying to look more confident than I was feeling. “Of course. I said I can handle it,” I said. Looking at their worried state, I decided that they could live without hearing just how close of a call it had been. “But, let’s go into the dungeon. We have a lot to talk about.” </p>",

    "content": "<p>After the familiar sensation of slipping through the gate, I stepped on a smooth, stone floor, radiating heat. A dry, hot wind that felt like I had just opened the lid of an oven. Calling it uncomfortable would have been an understatement. </p><p>The dungeon mist here was a familiar sight, blocking my view of everything above seventy feet to the side, but what I could see was enough to make a judgment about the nature of the dungeon. </p><p>It was a volcanic environment, which had many dangerous implications. But, even before I could focus on that, something else scared me. </p><p>Ahead in the mist, there was another glow of a dungeon gate, cutting through the mist the way the others that led outside had been cutting. It was a dungeon gate leading outside. My heart chilled at the implications. </p><p>What if they could open multiple gates that were going in and out. The strategic implications alone…</p><p>“Focus,” I muttered to myself as I rushed in the exact opposite direction. The chaos I had created would inevitably calm down soon. I had limited time, and checking whether that gate was leading to a different location as I suspected was not something I could afford at the moment. </p><p>Especially since the nature of the dungeon made it very likely that we were facing the worst-case situation. The dungeon here was picked specifically to target Maria. Just bringing the news would have been critical. Maria was our greatest strategic asset, and just knowing that her magic wouldn’t work rather than having to treat it as a worst-case scenario was enough to justify my expedition. </p><p>However, that didn’t mean it was the only thing I could do. I moved deeper into the dungeon, ignoring the sensation akin to moving deeper into an oven. </p><p>The environment didn’t change as I moved, the smell of sulfur and ash filling my nose. I saw no sign of lava or open fire, but I wasn’t too surprised. After all, this was only the first floor. </p><p>I searched for dungeon crystals and beasts, but both of them proved rarer than I had hoped. Considering a small army had been loitering here, the lack of both wasn’t a big shock. Instead, I focused on collecting other things. </p><p>I picked a few rocks, only to be surprised when I caught hints of silver and iron within their structure. Too little, not worthwhile extracting, but its existence alone suggested there might be a deposit with higher purity. </p><p>Unfortunately, prospecting for it would not exactly have been a worthwhile use of my time. </p><p>Next, I focused on the plants. There weren’t many, but similar to our insect dungeon, I came across a few dead bushes that looked burnt, but still had living seeds. I collected both the seeds and branches. </p><p>Unfortunately, I didn’t have time to actually test their growth, not without wasting some precious time. I probably had less than a minute before they caught onto my subterfuge, which would have made it far more difficult for me to escape. </p><p>The obsidian and ash crushed under my feet as I continued, desperately searching for a monster. Just one would have been enough, one that I came across soon enough. </p><p>A giant lizard, standing at the edge. “Let’s experiment,” I said as I raised my hand, my mana flowing out in a pattern that was getting useful. </p><p>[-100 Mana]</p><p>The fire bolt flew toward the monster with eerie accuracy … and splashed against its skin uselessly, barely enough to get its attention. With a hiss, it rushed toward me, showing no hint of intelligence, similar to the insects I had gotten used to dealing with. </p><p>However, just because it wasn’t intelligent, didn’t mean it wasn’t dangerous. The biggest weakness of the insects was their lack of mobility. They relied on their armor and corrosion effect, which were easy to deal with as long as one was armed correctly. </p><p>The giant lizard, on the other hand, was fast and agile. It rushed toward me with an uncertain path, easily dodging my first spear attacks to claw at me. Admittedly, those attacks were deliberately slow and telegraphed, but it was still more than what the farmers could achieve.</p><p>Worse, that was not the full extent of the problem. As it smashed against my forearm, I was met with a very unfortunate notification. </p><p>[-5 Health]</p><p>It had some kind of a heat attack, not entirely unlike the corrosion attack of the giant insects. Five points of health was nothing significant, but considering it was the result despite my armor that had managed to handle most attacks with ease, it was not good news. </p><p>Unfortunately, I wasn’t ready to remove my gauntlet and see how much it would damage if I was wearing substandard equipment. </p><p>“That’s enough,” I muttered as I slashed my weapon, killing it with a single attack. A quick examination showed that its mana was concentrated at his front claws. A rapid slash later, I had two in my possession. </p><p>I didn’t wait for it to disappear, as the minute it would take was too precious to be wasted. Instead, I continued running at full speed in a straight line, killing six more before I came across the first dungeon crystal. </p><p>“Hopefully, they’ll be enough to reverse engineer an attack,” I decided as I turned back to the gate, hoping that it would be enough to return. </p><p>It was not. </p><p>When I had reached the dungeon gate, I could already see several people around the gate. At first, I assumed that they were pulling back the army, but that didn’t seem to be the case. </p><p>They seem to be guarding the gate against a possible infiltration. I thought about trying the other end of the gate, but considering the complete unknown it presented, I didn’t dare to. </p><p>Instead, I decided to pull a small trick. I changed my posture as I started walking toward the door with contemptuous disregard. “Emergency orders, let me pass through,” I said to the guards that were holding the line, and pushed one of them. </p><p>“Hey, careful —” he gasped, but I ignored him as I continued to walk toward the glowing gate. It was a simple, absurd trick, one that wouldn’t have worked against a more disciplined army, but I stepped through the gate, once again arriving at the valley, feeling like I was about to be saved. </p><p>The robed figure must have managed to stop whatever he was doing with the other gate, and was walking toward the current one. His bodyguards were with him, but all of them were looking at the other side. </p><p>They were clearly expecting the enemy to come from their other side. </p><p>Opportunity. </p><p>Even as I took a step forward, I pulled my sword, and used Fleeting Step to cover the distance. It was a risky call, one that would make my retreat far more dangerous, but whatever he was doing to the gate was too dangerous to be ignored. </p><p>I was willing to bet that, even for Thomas or the forces supporting him, someone who was able to manipulate gates was not something that could be replenished easily. </p><p>As I swung my sword, I could see his expression turning contemptuous, as if what I was doing was completely harmless. That same expression twisted once a thick blue glow covered my sword, but only after it shattered some kind of invisible shield with ease, it turned into panic. </p><p>Then, it was too late. He didn’t have a head anymore. </p><p>His guards reacted at once, but the way they were split, they couldn’t intervene fast enough. I rushed forward, ripping the satchel on my target’s waist even as I moved full speed. To their credit, the guards had reacted fast, closing on me with impressive speed. </p><p>One against four, I didn’t fancy my chances, even with my armor. They didn’t have to kill me. Just slowing me down was all they needed. Luckily, the fortress gate was still open. </p><p>[-20 Mana]</p><p>I used Floating Stride, levitating even as I rushed through them, trusting my armor to hold against their hurried attacks, betting that they would be only able to deliver glancing blows. </p><p>My sudden flight caught them by surprise, enough so that I was able to jump out of the gate, though even the fear for my own life didn’t prevent my body from locking in fear due to floating. As a consequence, I rolled on the ground in a very undignified manner. </p><p>That seemed to surprise the four guards enough to slow them for a second, which was all I needed to dart directly to the spot where I had hidden my supplies. It was less about their direct value — as they merely represented a couple hours of work at most, as long as Maria helped — and more about my acute need. </p><p>With the mountain filled with an army, I needed the full range of my abilities. </p><p>Especially since I had seen one of the bodyguards remove a familiar device and send a message. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Once I saw the fortress that was built deep into the valley, with enough effort put into its construction to make it difficult to notice from the sky, I didn’t rush down immediately no matter how tempting it was. </p><p>Instead, I first picked an empty cave with a concealed entrance halfway down the mountain where I could drop down without being noticed, and started watching the place. My job was made easy by the fact that they didn’t have any patrol running at the side I was. There were several guards, but they were concentrated on the other side. </p><p>It was negligent, but it made sense. The biggest thing they feared was accidental discovery, and having hundreds of soldiers running around would be counterproductive to that aim. After all, even with a cursory aim, they could have noticed my presence easily. </p><p>The darkness of the night wasn’t too far away, so I decided to spend my time observing the area, trying to pick a vector to approach from. If it wasn’t for the advantages granted by Perception — which I suspected a considerable portion of the scouts would possess — I might have tried to sneak in, but I chose to wait, watching from a great distance. </p><p>Unfortunately, that was not a good way to gather information. The patrols didn’t change, but that was a poor way to make a judgment. So was the size of the fortress. Admittedly, the fortress looked too small to host more than a few dozen people comfortably, but with a dungeon gate there, that was not a good way to make a judgment either. </p><p>There might be just a dozen people like I suspected, or they might have an army hidden inside. I had absolutely no way of making sure. </p><p>“Maybe a little trick is in order,” I muttered as I went out to pick a small branch from a tree. Cutting one might get their attention, but growing one inside would not. </p><p>Once inside the cave, I used it to grow a few trees before cutting them into pieces. Soon, I was looking at a hundred human-shaped cutouts. Not enough to trick anyone during the day, but the same wasn’t true at night, which wasn’t too far away. </p><p>Though, the real trick was that, a few of them had tiny metal amulets, which would slowly radiate mana if I put a crushed piece of shell inside, radiating the sensation that someone was using magic against someone with Essence. </p><p>The rest of my time, I spent digging a tunnel to the bottom of the valley, right under a very sharp cliff where I couldn’t be seen from outside the moment I stepped out. As I worked, the night arrived, covering the valley in darkness. Afraid of being noticed, they were using no illumination sources. </p><p>“Let’s see how they’ll react to fear,” I muttered. Sneaking into the fortress was a challenging option. Unless, of course, they had something they feared distracting them. And, since they were plotting to take down a fire mage, what better way to do that. </p><p>“Time to test how effective my new trick is,” I said as I grew another tree in the cave, but this time, I focused on one idea. </p><p>Flammability. </p><p>The results were spectacular, creating a tree that did a nice impression of a chemical fire starter. I grew ten logs, and positioned them correctly. Yet, before making a move, I did one more thing. I dug several areas on the face of the mountain, doing my best to destabilize the whole structure.</p><p>Only after I activated the metal talismans, I lit them on fire. </p><p>By using my neglected Fire Bolt skill. </p><p>[-100 Mana]</p><p>It wasn’t just a sense of poetic justice that made me use that spell. It was likely that they had someone who could feel mana, and a fire spell, however basic, was a good way to alert them. And, with them raising the alarm, the guards would be met with several huge cylinders of fire.</p><p>It was like an old-fashioned magic trick, giving a hint, and letting the audience come to the wrong conclusion. Only, in this case, the reward for their cooperation was not entertainment.  </p><p>The logs blazed into life as they rolled down the hill, creating an incredible commotion. Even as shouts of alarm rose from the fortress, I delved into the tunnel I had dug, rushing to the bottom of the valley while staying hidden, unable to help but feel tense, afraid that I would find enemies waiting for me at the end of the tunnel. </p><p>Unfortunately, there was no such thing as absolute safety in battle. </p><p>When I arrived at the bottom of the valley, I was met with a small army spilling out of the fortress, confirming my worst fear. Especially since, their presence didn’t mean that I could simply retreat. </p><p>The only good thing was that they didn’t look like a regular army. They wore familiar black armor, and the weapons they were wielding were equally impressive, but the way they moved didn’t feel like an army that was familiar with working together. </p><p>And, currently, they were between me and the fortress. </p><p>I switched to my hammer, and swung it against the face of the cliff I picked for this exact purpose.</p><p>[-25 Mana]</p><p>The modified move from Quake Hammer did wonders destroying a large section, but I moved as fast as I could to deliver three more attacks, hoping that it would be enough even as I depleted my mana to merely ten points. </p><p>It was. </p><p>The whole face of the mountain, with the vegetation on fire from the earlier logs, shifted down, creating a minor landslide. Unfortunately, while it could have easily taken down a mundane army, it merely inconvenienced the current one. </p><p>After all, I wasn’t the only one with supernatural abilities. </p><p>However, it was enough to create chaos. Some of the army had dispersed despite the orders, running away in fear. Some rushed to the mountaintop, moving around the small landslide I had created, toward the shadows that they could see at the hilltop. </p><p>Several people delivered orders at once, while the force split into multiple smaller ones as they tried to position themselves against the threat. </p><p>Meanwhile, I quietly modified my armor to look similar to theirs, renewed my mana by cracking a shell, and dropped my spear and hammer alongside my pack, bringing only a small satchel. I looked like just another soldier. I rushed forward, the cacophony allowing me to mix in with the group that looked the most disorganized. </p><p>It was an absurd trick, one that shouldn’t have worked, but I moved forward, aware that I had only one chance. Of course, I dared to do so because I could see that the general makeup of the army wasn’t too different from the ones that attacked me and Eleanor.</p><p>Should it come to that, I was confident that I could cut a path through them and escape, even if they had someone who had people that could rival Eleanor before she received my sword. The same wasn’t true if they had someone that could rival Maria … but, if they were willing to commit such an asset, they would have approached in a more direct manner. </p><p>It wasn’t a perfect analysis, but sometimes, pretty good was the limit of what one could achieve. </p><p>I moved in, the chaos of a poorly organized army helping me to hide my presence, particularly since I could see even more people, and the high amount of people attempting to leave the dungeon didn’t make doing so any easier. </p><p>Luckily, with the ongoing chaos, no one really paid attention to me even as I entered the fortress … only to freeze. I was expecting a dungeon gate. </p><p>Instead, I found two. </p><p>One of the gates was identical to the dungeon gates I had been passing repeatedly. A glowing, ethereal light. </p><p>The second was interesting. For one, it was larger, with more intense energy, but the more surprising part was the lines of energy: pure black in a way that reminded me of tainted energy. The process was equally interesting. The dungeon mist was roughly visible at the cracks, but it didn’t spill out. </p><p>What spilled out was tainted energy. </p><p>Then, right at the gate, stood a man wearing robes, radiating mana even as he kept his hand on the dungeon gate, using it to slowly widen the cracks. He looked lost in his task. Though, even as it spread through the cracks, I couldn’t help but be disgusted by his mana. </p><p>He had four guards, each looking more formidable than the ragtag army that was busy panicking, ignoring the crowd. They didn’t look like tangling with them was a good idea. Luckily, they seemed to be distracted by the commotion outside, one of the guards asking the robed man to stop. But, it looked like whatever he was doing wasn’t something that could be interrupted with ease.   </p><p>Even as I glanced at the situation, I wondered what it meant for them to do what they were doing so openly. Were they that confident that their ragtag army would keep it a secret? Were they not concerned about their secrets being revealed… Maybe they were confident that, as long as Charisma was used, their secrets would stay safe. </p><p>Or maybe, they planned to silence the whole army to keep their secrets hidden once they outlived their usefulness. </p><p>That last one, in particular, was too horrifying of an idea, but from what I had seen, Thomas didn’t seem to be particularly respectful of human life. </p><p>The forces that we suspected to be behind him, were even less so. </p><p>I paused, thinking of my options. I could limit myself to the safe gate. But, doing so would rely on one very dangerous assumption: that the two gates lead to the same dungeon. An assumption that would cost us dearly if it wasn’t true. </p><p>I decided to check it first. </p>",

    "content": "<p>It wasn’t the first time the source of Providence talked with me, but it didn’t get any less unsettling. It was one thing for such an entity that might be termed as some kind of god to exist, but another thing entirely for it to speak and ask for assistance, however limited. </p><p>The special treatment might have been welcome even with the size of the requests … but this time, it came with an unwelcome addition. </p><p>A great burst of power in the form of Providence, with three different targets. The first target was the giant tree. While it didn’t make it grow wildly, the transformation that it was going through was very distinct, both visually, and in terms of the presence it had as a spiritual pillar. </p><p>The second target was a bit more dubious. It hit the spirit vein, making it grow and transform in a way that was difficult to identify. The Qi output spiked sharply, threatening to shatter the formation through sheer weight … at least, until the Dao Gate behind the protection started to devour the energy. </p><p>Another situation that I had no idea whether it was good or bad, as it had never actually taken in Qi before, but I wasn’t in a position to address that. </p><p>Not when I was trying to deal with the last part of the trio. </p><p>Me. </p><p>I clenched my fists, trying to suppress the newfound strength that resonated with me, pure, intense … and utterly inconvenient; enough that I wondered if the power behind the providence was actually trying to sabotage me. </p><p>It was a decision that I wrote off equally quickly. The way the power filled my body wasn’t actually harmful. The same power, delivered offensively, would have been enough to evaporate me in a second. The power was clearly trying to help me. </p><p>I had no doubt that, if I was trying to break through the same primitive brute force way the ancient martial artists I had read in the records, I would have appreciated the help greatly. It would have raised my chances from a single-digit percentage to half and half. Unfortunately, in my situation, it meant that it was actually reducing my chances of success while also ruining my timetable. </p><p>“What an inconvenient assistance,” I muttered even as I looked down, which felt like the direction that the power had come from. The depths of the ground. I didn’t know if it was true, but I had no problem admonishing the force, knowing that the intellect behind the power wouldn’t understand. </p><p>I didn’t know if the intellect behind the power was some kind of simple, primal force that lacked complicated human understanding, or if there was some kind of barrier that prevented smooth communication; but either way, it was clear that the power lacked the ability to track my movements. </p><p>With a groan, I channeled the boundless pure essence that filled my body, turning that into the connection with the giant tree. Luckily, while there was some pain, it was a mere pale shadow compared to what I had experienced earlier. </p><p>As much as I wanted to curse the inconvenience of the ‘divine help’ I did not. I didn’t have the luxury. I needed to focus on my breakthrough. And, focus I did. I used the power to enhance the connection between me and the tree, which gave me the first glimpse of the new realm. </p><p>It was intense. </p><p>It wasn’t the idea of power. That, I had through connecting with the System. Combined with formations, alchemy, and other tricks, I had more power than I could imagine a few months ago, when I was merely an injured athlete. </p><p>But, that power always felt distant. It was like I was using a gun to attack a distant target. It was storing, powerful, and deadly, but it had nothing to do with the sheer visceral feeling of being in a fistfight. As the connection grew, so did the deep understanding… </p><p>The tree in front of me seemed to acknowledge this change, its leaves rustling as if it were in applause. </p><p>Connecting with the spiritual pillar was supposed to be the hardest part of the process, but I found that it went smoother than I realized, nothing like the chaotic touch-and-go experience of Elsana. But, maybe it shouldn’t be a surprise. Unlike her, who had been dealing with the confusing ancient volcano, I had not only invented the martial arts that fed the tree, but also handled every step of its rapid growth. </p><p>Of course, just because the process was safer and faster than I expected, it didn’t mean that it was actually easy. As a cool, foreign expression spread into my body, I had to control every second of the process to avoid the dangerous side effects. </p><p>I would have loved the opportunity to slow the process down, but without it, I had no chance but the channel the flow of energy to my body, starting with bones and moving outward. With every second, my body changed, and so did my essence. </p><p>Even as I went through those steps, I was going through many core moves of the art, channeling the essence appropriately as my transformation continued. The change was … impressive. Every palm, every punch, embodied the conception of the very forest itself; alive and strong, cycling between nurturing and deadly. </p><p>I took a deep breath, trying to understand the transition. The process was less abstract than I expected. As my internal essence aligned with the primal forces of nature, I could feel the tree to be a part of me. </p><p>I would have loved to stop here. Unfortunately, the power from the ground continued to flow, targeting me, the tree, and the spirit vein. It meant, I needed to continue advancing my martial cultivation …  a process that I was actually blind to. Even with the ancient writings from the Burning Ice sect, I didn’t have a true understanding of how to improve my cultivation once I reached the Spirit Infusion realm, which seemed to be the limit of martial cultivation. </p><p>“Let’s try something unconventional,” I muttered as I focused on the newly formed connection between me and the giant tree, and used it as a transfer channel to harmlessly get rid of the power. The tree devoured the power greedily, not restricted by its biology like I was. </p><p>It was an intense focus, so, until it was too late, I didn’t notice the way its roots wrapped around the spirit vein, not until the Qi that was radiating suddenly dropped. I looked at it in fear, which abated somewhat when I examined the phenomenon and realized that the roots weren’t actually damaging the spirit vein. </p><p>“A beautiful phenomenon. Too bad I don’t have the time to examine it,” I muttered even as I channeled the last bit of excess power, and focused on stabilizing my martial cultivation. I had to, as at the horizon, the ship continued to appear. </p><p>The same one I had encountered, which was obvious due to the giant gap in its structure due to volcanic attack, showing signs of a hasty repair. </p><p>I ignored the threat as I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. Not only I could feel the giant tree, but indirectly, I could feel the presence of many enclaves I created, each linked to me through providence and martial essence, empowering me further. </p><p>In the state of unity, I focused inward, trying to quickly understand the nature of the energy, one that was needed to create my own attacks. It was another thing that Burning Ice records had been lacking, but I didn’t worry about that. </p><p>Unlike them, I had a huge library of Qi cultivation attacks that surpassed Perfection, giving me a deep and accurate understanding of concepts that the ancient martial artists couldn’t even imagine. And, while the martial essence and Qi were very different, it wasn’t different enough to make those attacks completely unusable. </p><p>“Can I?” I suddenly muttered as I tested a few attacks, only to realize something fascinating. With the Spirit Infusion Essence powering the attacks, they looked showy and impressive like Qi cultivation attacks. </p><p>I repeated the attack, this time wrapping it with a layer of Qi, and smiled. </p><p>The trick wasn’t perfect, but the attack still looked like it somehow belonged to a Qi cultivator. And, with that, it might be possible to actually hide my roots. </p><p>Yes, the cultivators would treat the sudden appearance of a master like an abomination, but not as much as the sudden appearance of an ancient martial artist who also cultivated. </p><p>I smiled as I patted the tree, feeling its growing life. “And, if the trick fails, you will certainly work better as a surprise attack, right,” I muttered as I talked with a tree that couldn’t understand me. </p><p>I was ready to greet the unwelcome cultivators. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I stood at the giant tree that was barely concealed by the formation, letting its majesty wash over me despite the urgency. Always running around and fighting, it was easy to forget the majesty of the world I found myself in. </p><p>A world in which I was supposed to live calmly, in a carefree manner after being punished by a weird deity. Instead, somehow, I ended up as the protector of billions of people, a choice I made, one that I needed to truly fulfill. </p><p>I took a deep breath as I looked up, observing the immaculate, overwhelming presence of the tree, threatening to suffocate my enemies as its height had risen high enough to be measured by miles rather than yards. </p><p>Even then, it required multiple miles rather than fractions. </p><p>Honestly, the size it reached had surprised me, but it looked like its roots had wrapped gently around the spirit vein, but it was still providing the necessary Qi to my formations, so I took that as a positive sign. Everything I knew about the spiritual plant mastery suggested that it wasn’t supposed to grow that far, but it did. </p><p>My guess, it had something to do with the Providence I continued to devour, letting the tree grow without the restriction of the heavens, probably helped by the martial arts side now that it had an avenue to counter-attack. </p><p>“This is going to suck,” I muttered even as I took a deep breath, enjoying the sight of the branches stretched above me, a living tapestry of emerald hues that hid a devastating power. It wasn’t the prospect of the breakthrough that scared me. After watching Elsana and Lannayin's breakthrough, I was confident I could reach the peak of the Spiritual Infusion realm without the slightest issue. </p><p>No, what scared me was what would come after. I was already a part of the battle between two mysterious sources of Providence, that much was clear. But, adapting to ancient martial arts was a step too far. </p><p>I could have easily erased it if it was merely reaching the Connate realm. Unfortunately, in terms of the power it provided, the Connate realm was nothing against a force of cultivators that included multiple Golden Core members. Not even the Blood Essence realm was enough. </p><p>No, I needed to reach Spiritual Infusion. And, I didn’t know if, once reaching that realm, I could turn back. I had seen the way Elsana and Lannayin had been bound to the essence of the mountain irrevocably.</p><p>And, despite its ancient roots, the strength of the volcano that had been starved for Providence for centuries was nothing compared to my tree, fed by the resonance from hundreds of thousands of Blood Essence Realm martial artists. </p><p>If the records I had read back in the mountain were even halfway accurate, even the greatest martial arts sect hadn’t tried something that grand. Maybe Everdawn Empire was the exception, as everything I had learned implied that they were strong enough to make the cultivators use external methods, but maybe not. </p><p>Either way, I was doing something scary, something with circumstances that were impossible to foresee. But, it was better than letting billions die. </p><p>“It’s time for a breakthrough,” I muttered even as I plopped a concentrated essence pill into my mouth, a special formula I had designed to release the energy it contained slowly to help me breakthrough, which gave me the confidence breakthrough several steps at once. </p><p>I closed my eyes as I put my hand on the tree, a gentle breeze rustling through the tree giving me the answers. It was the heart, the essence of the Forest Dance, a concept that I knew intimately considering I was the one that designed it from scratch. </p><p>“The first form,” I muttered even as I delivered a gentle palm strike against the air, a soft, deflection strike that helped me to mobilize the Essence correctly. A presence bloomed in my chest.</p><p>The essence of true Forest Dance. </p><p>I was familiar with the essence externally considering the army of martial artists I had raised, but experiencing it firsthand was completely different. I doubted that an ordinary martial artist would notice the difference, but for me, the difference was like night and day.  </p><p>If the old essence was a can of warm, flat coke, the ancient martial arts was a masterful wine. Instead of a flat, single-tone feeling, it was a living, breathing force. I could feel the echo of the giant tree in its presence, giving me an unmatched strength. </p><p>But, it was just the beginning. </p><p>I touched the essence as I channeled toward my muscles, opening the first set of acupuncture points, all of them at once. For an ordinary martial artist, it was a long and laborious process, but not only I had my talent enhanced, but also my knowledge of essence was truly unmatched. One move was enough to bring me to Muscle Reinforcement. </p><p>As I reached that, I could feel a providence link with the tree. It was weak, but present. Curious, I activated the System to draw some Qi. It pulled some Providence, but the connection between me and thee was untouched. </p><p>Another sign of permanency. </p><p>I sighed as I closed my eyes, allowing my senses to attune to the natural energies around me. Once I felt the energy in my chest grow enough, I used another palm attack. Skin Refinement. Then, I turned inward, and another Palm brought me to Bone Forging. </p><p>I let out a breath, and eight gates in my body opened at once, bringing me to the peak of the Connate realm. I crouched down for a moment, letting the pill fill my body with essence to the brim as I considered the move I had just made. </p><p>Opening each gate was a dangerous affair, which was why, Connate realm martial artists were hard to find without alchemist assistance. Anyone else trying to do the same would have killed themselves. </p><p>But, as much as I wanted to enjoy that momentary success, I didn’t have time. Not when the giant shadow of the ship continued to appear in the sky. </p><p>Once my energy recovered to the peak, I stood again, and this time, I ran through a full kata, each move channeling my essence inward. Previously, I could feel the essence, but it was an object that was separate from me, limited to my meridians. </p><p>Each move infused it deeply into my blood, allowing me to reach the Blood Essence Realm.</p><p>The change was wondrous. For the last few months, using formations to enhance my senses to make sure I was not in danger had turned into a habit, but for the first time, it was unnecessary. As the forest essence filled my blood, my senses sharpened; I could hear the distant call of a bird, and the subtle movements of creatures hidden in the underbrush. </p><p>The improvement was wondrous. I had a feeling that, unlike the other Blood Essence realm martial artists, I could actually fight against Foundation Establishment cultivators and defeat them even without using the cultivator skills. </p><p>“Now, the fun part,” I muttered as I flicked the silver needles, and they landed on every single acupuncture point I had, ready Qi to help me progress through the minor realms of Blood Essence. </p><p>Blood Essence realm was an interesting step. At its core, it required the constant usage of the martial essence, each repeat transforming the body further until it was even better aligned to the spiritual pillar, which was necessary to not burn inside out while trying to reach the Spiritual Infusion realm. </p><p>With a wave of my hand, I created a formation to handle the infusion process, as I couldn’t handle it in real time. </p><p>The reason was simple. Pain. </p><p>What I was doing was worse than operating without a painkiller. By trying to condense the process that should take days and weeks even with the most careful alchemist's assistance to merely a minute, I had created the perfect torture. </p><p>But, I squeezed my lips and took the pain. It was my arrogance that I could have an army of Burning Ice Spiritual Infusion martial artists to support me that made me delay that much. </p><p>The pain was bad, but it was far from the worst price one had to pay for such arrogance, so I just took it. And, it wasn’t pointless. As I guided the forest’s essence to weave itself into every fiber of my being, a warm surge coursed through me, the power I commanded increasing exponentially. </p><p>Once the formation stopped working, I stayed on my feet. The pain had been bad, but the strength that followed was hard to comprehend. Yes, from a pure devastation perspective, I had commanded greater forces, but having that as a part of my body was something different. </p><p>I was at the peak of Blood Essence, with a power that surpassed every other martial artist I had seen at my fingertips. Suddenly, I was confident that I could defend Markas without stepping into Spiritual Infusion. </p><p>Fate disagreed, and not in its usual, impossible-to-detect ways. Suddenly, a sense of power rose from the land, and slammed against me, and three words rang in my mind, but this time, they were far more distinct. </p><p>INVADERS. IMPROVE. DESTROY.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Once I felt the tapping pattern at the crate, followed by a shift, I counted to thirty before I pushed open the hatch, and stepped into the ditch. </p><p>As far as plans went, this was a simple one. Once I hid in the crate that was mixed into a bigger delivery to the town, Harold brought me out, only to drop the crate into a deep ditch when the vision around them was blocked. </p><p>Just to be on the safe side, I dug a tunnel from the bottom of the ditch rather than climbing directly. Luckily, mana attacks were equally excellent at digging through hardened Earth as it was at killing monsters. I dug for almost half a mile before I finally arrived at the surface. And, once on the surface, I used the Fleeting Step to move in a straight line, almost perpendicular to my destination. </p><p>My little detour added some extra travel time, but it was a sacrifice I was willing to make. Since I suspected the sudden timing of the dungeon break was not a coincidence, it stood to reason that they had some people inducing the dungeon to break, and if there were, they would have scouts, particularly on this side of the town. </p><p>“However, the implications…” I muttered, suddenly feeling overwhelmed by what it would mean if my assumption that the dungeon break could be induced artificially was true. Did it mean that it was being used as a weapon, to get rid of the troublesome towns, or deal with enemies? </p><p>I wanted to say that humanity would never do something so cruel … but sometimes, knowing history was more of a curse than a blessing. Humanity was capable of incredible cruelty, particularly when there was a layer to isolate them from the action. </p><p>Like letting dungeon monsters loose. </p><p>“We will see,” I said to myself as I ran, dodging the monsters I faced. After all, the beasts outside didn’t share the dungeon monsters’ convenient feature of disappearing once they died, so killing them would create an inconvenient track. Luckily, I was fast enough to dodge most of them, helped by the fact that the surrounding area was cleaned regularly by the patrols. </p><p>During my journey to this unknown dungeon had a lot of time to think, particularly since I was taking the long route. So, I pulled the long page of formulas Maria had written, trying to model the way the mana moved. It was not accurate, but I didn’t expect it to be. </p><p>Mathematical modeling was a tricky process even though it didn’t look that way to a layman. It required a choice between abstraction and accuracy, particularly when studying systems with discrete parts that couldn’t be predicted easily, like turbulent fluids…</p><p>Or, people. </p><p>It was the whole idea I had based my career on, that as long as driving factors could be understood, the development of society could be predicted. Not in a perfect manner, but enough to guide the actions of the decision-makers about complicated topics. At least, the rare times they chose to care about the benefits of the people rather than the election results. </p><p>“Oh, the irony,” I said even as I continued to read all the formulas Maria had written for me. Before the Cataclysm, I often read various physics and math papers, trying to find ones that I could use for my own discipline. And, now, I was doing the exact opposite. </p><p>Well, the exact opposite as long as we assume mana was a phenomenon of physics, which was an assumption the jury was still out on. </p><p>However, the best part about this step was that it didn’t require a computer. It was required for the initial collection and processing of the data, but ultimately, that was what Maria had given me. But, once that data was collected, the benefits of computers dwindled to nothing. </p><p>Conceptual modeling required a very rigorous mathematical background, reinforced by clarity of thought and inspiration. It was why, even when computers were an option, I preferred to work with pen and paper. </p><p>As I got further away from the town, the density of the monsters started to increase, enough that I had to pull my spear to kill the occasional beast that was too fast to be ditched easily. But, even then, I held the papers in my right hand, trying to find a general function that not only confirmed the general objectives but was also simple enough to be useful. </p><p>It was a far trickier process to handle. </p><p>For example, asking for someone to pick an apple. While it was too simple to be classified as such, ‘one apple’ could be treated as a mathematical model. It was certainly an abstraction. It was certainly useful when asking one’s roommate to bring one from the fridge, however, it was less useful as a part of a recipe, where ounce and pound served as a much better representation. </p><p>And, it carried no information when it came to many other features, from whether it was rotten or not to taste. And, that was just what we called a descriptive model, arguably the easiest mathematical model to construct. </p><p>What I was trying to do was not a descriptive model, but a predictive one, one that could allow me to push the mana into that state without assistance from Maria. Even if she was willing and able to help me — which was not a fair demand in the first place — the process I used currently created a significant bottleneck for the production of epic-grade metal. </p><p>It was alright for making spears and daggers, but less so for swords and hammers. As for armor, it didn’t come close to being enough, and my experience against those transformed monsters had shown how critical of a role armor could play. </p><p>Then, there was the skill improvement aspect. Finding a way to artificially create ‘dense mana’ was critical if I wanted to reach Legendary before I reached level fifty and faced another opportunity to upgrade my class. </p><p>The trip to the area took almost six hours even at my full speed, as not only did I take an indirect path to the area, but I also did my best to stick to the forested areas and other canopies in case they had a flying scout, which gave me enough time to study the formulas she had collected, meaning it was the time to test them. </p><p>When it came to testing, my first reflex was to mentally complain about the lack of a computer once again. After all, the validation process of the model was as critical as the initial model, and only detailed simulations allowed to —</p><p>“Oh, I’m a moron,” I growled as the realization hit. In sociology, I had to rely on computer models, because for the topics I worked on, experimentation ranged from merely extremely unethical to plain impossible. </p><p>The same wasn’t true for smithing. </p><p>I had to admit, it was tempting to drop everything and start testing, to see if it worked. And, if I was dealing with a lesser threat, I might have actually done that. </p><p>Unfortunately, for the threat I was facing, that was clearly not the case. The only exception I made was to pause for a few seconds and write down my insights. I didn’t expect to forget them, but it was better safe than sorry. </p><p>Once I put my notes inside my armor, I stopped thinking about it, and instead checked the map given by Rosie. It didn’t pinpoint the location of the dungeon, just identified a valley as a potential target. </p><p>Curious, I had used a metal tube to check the content of the air, and noticed the presence of dungeon taint. It was light enough that I would have missed it if I had merely used Analyze, but Advanced Observe was much better for it.  </p><p>And, the density increased as I got closer to the valley. </p><p>“As far as confirmations go, that’s a good one,” I murmured as I paused, doing my best to examine the geography of the place. </p><p>The valley was a double-edged sword for them. It concealed them from airborne griffin scouts and allowed them to funnel anyone who might stumble upon them accidentally, but it also gave me an angle to approach them without being noticed.</p><p>The climb was slow, almost tedious. As I approached, I was prepared to kill any wild beast that came close, but to my surprise, the mountain was empty. At first, I thought it might be the scouts that killed them, but then it clicked. </p><p>Tainted energy was a good way to lure the surrounding monsters.</p><p>Sneaking to a random mountain that was empty yet, teeming with monsters, would have been impossible. But, the situation was similar to the town, where most of the surrounding monsters had been killed, likely by attacking toward the dungeon gate, lured in by the energy from the dungeon that was about to break.  </p><p>“Well, I’ll take any advantage I can get,” I muttered even as I climbed the steep surface of the hills with the surety of a mountain goat, glad that my phobia for flying didn’t trigger as long as my feet were on solid ground. </p><p>It didn’t make much sense, but no phobia truly did. However, I didn’t have any time to ponder upon the situation, as once I reached the peak, I looked down the valley. </p><p>Only to see a small, enclosed fort at the center. </p><p>I had my target.  </p>",

    "content": "<p>“And, this is the last one. Five hundred pieces, ready for any emergency,” I said, annoyed that all that work didn’t give me even a handful of points. It wasn’t surprising, but that didn’t prevent the blooming annoyance. “Along with the upgraded condenser, we’re ready to help the farmers improve as necessary. It’s time to leave.” </p><p>“Are you sure you want to take this risk?” Maria suddenly asked. </p><p>I sighed. While forging, Maria had asked the same question in various forms almost fifty times. In an abstract sense, having someone to care about my safety was nice. Unfortunately, that abstract acknowledgment didn’t prevent it from getting annoying. “No, Maria. My answer hasn't changed in …” I said, making a move of checking my nonexistent watch, “the last two minutes.” </p><p>“No need to be sarcastic,” she grumbled. </p><p>“I disagree. This is the perfect time to be sarcastic,” I said, a little snippier than I had expected. “Sorry, it’s just the best way, and we live in a dangerous world. There’s no truly safe option.” </p><p>“Fine. I get it. I just don’t like it when you’re putting yourself at risk for me.” </p><p>I shrugged. “Not much we can do about it,” I said even as I started packing my stuff. I had to travel light, but I still wanted to bring a full set of tools, several ingots prepared based on an epic recipe, ready to be transformed as necessary, and about a dozen javelins made of the same material. And, after some thought, I put two full lure potions I had looted from the previous dungeon attack. </p><p>It was one advantage of being a superhuman blacksmith. Anything else I needed, I could prepare on the field. </p><p>Together, we moved back to the first floor, focusing more on the practical side, including how to set a second </p><p>“Before you leave, I have a gift for you,” she said. </p><p>“A gift?” I said. </p><p>“Yes, a gift,” she said as she pulled a paper, and started writing on it. A bunch of partial differential formulas, mixed with some topology. I quirked an eyebrow. “This is how I fold my mana while I help you,” she said. “I have done my best to turn it into a formula in case you face any danger. “I don’t know if it’ll work, but…” </p><p>“I …”  a gasp escaped my mouth, only to freeze. This was a big gift. No, more than just big. Incredible. I didn’t even have an idea how to start mapping the flows. When it came to physics, I was a novice at best, and fluid dynamics was one of the most troubling problems that plagued modern technology, often requiring supercomputers to solve most of the time. </p><p>And, in the old world, physics had been working with materials that didn’t suddenly decide between being liquid and gas for absolutely no reason. </p><p>While I examined the lines of the formula, trying to comprehend it, she finished writing another set of formulas, but she folded it up before I could read it. “This is the other part of my gift. But, I want you to promise you won’t open it unless it becomes absolutely necessary, and even if you do, you’ll do your best to be careful.” </p><p>“What’s that?” I asked. </p><p>“My meditation formula,” she added, then paused. “At least, the best approximation I had.” </p><p> I paused, not knowing what to say. It was an incredible gift, far bigger than the previous one, which was only a representation of my own skill, just in the form of a more generalized formula. This one represented one of her core secrets. </p><p>One that could potentially prove deadly to her if leaked, considering how fragile meditation skills were. </p><p>“I don’t know what to say,” I muttered. </p><p>She gave me a gentle smile even as she put it into my hands. “Then, don’t say anything. Just make sure to return safely.” </p><p>Before I could even figure out how to respond, she turned her back, and sped up with a flare of her mana, leaving me behind. I sighed as I watched her leave, trying to wrangle my own confusing feelings. This might be the single most thoughtful gift I have ever received. </p><p>And, I had no idea what I was feeling. </p><p>I let out a sigh even as I put both papers into a special container under my armor, securely fastened. Strangely, I felt no temptation to open the sealed letter, when a few weeks ago, the prospect of getting stronger would have been enough to treat that as a wish that was easily ignored. </p><p>I sighed even as I moved toward where Harold was waiting for me, with a metal box that previously held arrows. “Hello, sir,” he greeted me when I approached. </p><p>“Harold,” I greeted back. “Everything ready?” </p><p>“Yes, but…” he said. </p><p>“Yes, it’s as you have guessed. We detected another attempt, but this time, I decided to change the pace a bit. Let’s see how they’ll deal with an ambush,” I said, doing my best to look more confident than I was feeling. </p><p>Luckily, the longer my list of victories got, the less my acting mattered. Harold nodded in satisfaction. “That’s good, sir. But, what about the sudden change with the Farmer? I didn’t expect Lady Eleanor to help.” </p><p>I did my best to look smug. “I managed to convince her to train a team of elite fighters out of them, using a secret method,” I said. “That way, when I return, I’ll have a thousand elite warriors waiting for me in my guild.” </p><p>It was a lie, but it had enough truth mixed in to keep Harold focused and pacified. I didn’t like lying, but under the circumstances, the emergence of the dungeon was one. </p><p>“That’s ambitious, sir,” he said. “But, isn’t it  a bit risky?” </p><p>“Not at all. It’s a reasonable precaution, and if it helps my finances somewhat, even better.” </p><p>He nodded. “Is there any way I can help?” </p><p>I was about to refuse, when I realized we had missed one detail. “Actually, yes,” I said. “You can make several plans, outlining the process of evacuating the town directly to the dungeon, and share them with Eleanor. The more serious we take the threat, the harder she would work to train our members.” </p><p>He nodded, looking like he had accepted my rationale. “And, are we going to maintain the same hands-off approach when it comes to the ones that don't want to upgrade their classes, sir? Maybe we shouldn’t miss the opportunity.” </p><p>I shook my head. “Don’t change anything for the moment. I have made a promise to them. Anyone who wants to focus on their skill improvement is free to do so. Don’t pressure them indirectly either.” Then, I paused. “Not that I expect too many of them to persist once the first batch of farmers return with their improved stats and show off,” I added. </p><p>Harold’s expression shifted into a big smile. “I see, that’s your plan all along. Very clever, sir,” he said. “We’ll do our best to hunt on the fourth floor and gather more Rare Nurture skills.” </p><p>It was not my plan. On the contrary, I was sad that the excellent experiment I had in place had been ruined in merely a few days. I could have convinced Maria that the experiment was too important, but it didn’t feel right to manipulate the situation to keep it going. </p><p>Not when it could affect their survival. We had initially planned that experiment to take six months, because we were under the impression that the worst thing that could happen was a monster wave, which would give us two weeks to prepare.</p><p>A surprise dungeon nearby was something else. I wondered just how much of it was pure misfortune, and how much of it was a part of Thomas’ — or more likely, his supporters’ — plan. </p><p>My best guess was that it was fifty-fifty. The appearance of the dungeon was pure misfortune, but I would be willing to bet a lot that the timing of the breach had nothing to do with its natural lifecycle. It was more likely that they had a way to prematurely shatter a dungeon. </p><p>However, ultimately, it didn’t matter. I just needed to find a way to infiltrate the dungeon, or should I fail at that, stay near until the breach occurred so I could get a glimpse of the monsters that it spewed. </p><p>“Yeah, a storage of Rare Nurtures wouldn’t be amiss,” I said. “Make sure to stockpile them. The more, the better.” </p><p>“Even if we collect a thousand?” he asked. </p><p>“I won’t say anything even if you collect a hundred thousand, as long as you don’t neglect your other tasks,” I said even as I started walking toward the large metal box. “Now, that’s enough chit-chat. Seal me up.” </p><p>He did so, and I ended up in the dark. I took a deep breath, preparing myself for the violence to come, once more against an enemy of unknown caliber. </p><p>This time without the home ground advantage our dungeon had provided. </p><p>I called in the System, hoping for a sense of security. </p><p>—</p><p>[Mana Blacksmith - Level 43]</p><p>[Health 1290/1290] [Mana 210/210]</p><p>[Vitality 86 / Strength 86 / Dexterity 65 / Essence 21]</p><p>[Skills (9/13)</p><p>Mana Repair (Epic) - 102 [Advanced Observe]</p><p>Mana Forge (Epic) - 313 [Advanced Creative Forging, Advanced Mana Control]</p><p>Cleansing Meditation (Uncommon) - 139 [Controlled Flow, Superior Sensing, Purification]</p><p>Nurture (Epic) - 219</p><p>Quake Hammer (Rare) - 200 [Persistent Tremor]</p><p>Blade of Retribution (Rare) - 200 [Strike of Retribution]</p><p>Breeze Spear (Rare) - 200 [Floating Stride]</p><p>Fire Bolt (Basic) - 25 </p><p>Shoot (Basic) - 25]</p>",

    "content": "<p>“What’s wrong?” Maria asked the moment Eleanor arrived. Eleanor said nothing, just passed a letter to Maria. From the way her face fell, I doubted that it was good news. Then, I noticed the familiar seal, a tankard with a crack, signaling that it was a letter from Rosie. </p><p>I said nothing until Maria passed the letter to me, and I read it quickly. “An undiscovered dungeon? Only three days from a breach?“ I asked. </p><p>“Yes,” Maria said, looking tense. “Can we trust her?” </p><p>I first thought that she was asking Eleanor, but they both turned to me, which was not particularly stress-free. It was a difficult call. I had worked with Rosie before, and she had never steered me wrong. While she had been a consummate businesswoman with an incredible ability to bargain, she had always followed her deals. Not just in the letter, but in spirit as well. </p><p>“I’m inclined to believe her,” I decided. </p><p>“Why?” </p><p>“She already had a good chance to betray us during the earlier debacle if she was so inclined,” I said. “Or, if she is hedging her bets, she would have pulled back her fledgling guild with the rest. It could be that she’s working for Thomas, and that they are pulling a dangerous double-bluff, but…” </p><p>“It’s unlikely,” Maria admitted. “She had been a key supplier during all of this, even more so than what we expected.”</p><p>“That’s right,” I said, then paused.</p><p>“Is something wrong?” Eleanor interrupted. </p><p>“Not really,” I said. “It’s just that Rosie has always been a very careful player. I had seen her fight. She could have done better than operating a busy inn in a small town, but she had limited herself. I had always thought that she was holding back because she lacked grand ambitions. But, maybe she was waiting for an opportunity to make a big play.” </p><p>That didn’t enhance Eleanor’s mood in any way. “That doesn’t make me trust her anymore.” </p><p>“And, I’m not trying to,” I said. “I’m just sharing my impression. Ultimately, my interactions with her are wildly different from what you have. But, sometimes shared benefits are all that’s needed to establish a good alliance.” </p><p>“And, sometimes, it’s not,” Eleanor said. “If she wants to forge a closer alliance, why is she not here?” I shrugged. After all, she had a point, and I didn’t feel particularly compelled to defend Rosie, especially since I had no idea what her plan was, only that she had one. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have sent me here, asking for a detailed report about the dungeon. </p><p>It felt like that was such a long time ago. </p><p>“Enough,” Maria cut in. “What she wants in the long term, or what we can put together doesn’t matter. The important thing is, do we believe her about the dungeon warning?” </p><p>“I do,” Eleanor admitted reluctantly. I nodded as well. </p><p>“Then, we need to decide what to do. Three days doesn’t give us a lot of time to move around.” </p><p>“How far is the dungeon?” I asked. </p><p>“Flying, merely half an hour, but if we’re to bring an army there, we need to move in a few hours at most,” Maria said. </p><p>“We’re not going to ask for reinforcements?” Eleanor said. </p><p>Maria looked conflicted. “We should, but from whom? It’s clear that my family put their support behind Thomas. We won’t receive anything but excuses from them. As for other guilds or nearby towns…” she added, not even bothering to finish her sentences. “No, we have to bring an army there and deal with it.” </p><p>“What if they use it as a chance to attack the town?” I asked. “Or, they ambush us while we’re dealing with the dungeon?” </p><p>“You suspect that it's bait. I thought you trusted Rosie.” </p><p>“Not necessarily a bait,” I said. “And, it’s not about how much I trust Rosie. She’s not omnipotent, and I’m assuming a dungeon could be discovered in many different ways.” </p><p>Maria nodded. “Yes. There are some products from the System shop that could detect the presence of a dungeon, especially if they are close to a breach and leaking dungeon miasma. But…” </p><p>“But, what,” I asked. </p><p>“They have relatively limited range,” Eleanor continued. “It’s rare for them to extend any more than a few hundred yards, and even the best one we used extended to merely half a mile. So, she has to know about it.” </p><p>“Or, she expected the probability, and sent scouts to check. Scouts that found what ours had missed.” </p><p>“Yes, they should have found it,” Eleanor added. “It looks like we have more traitors, hiding reports.” </p><p>“Not necessarily,” I interrupted. They looked at me. “Is it fair to assume that the patrol schedule is quite hectic since the guilds have retreated?” </p><p>“If anything, that’s an understatement. Especially with some of them assigned to your forces.” </p><p>“Trying to conceal scouting reports when the scouts rotate frequently is bound to be difficult, and even for Thomas, it’s a bad plan. It’s easier to just sabotage the devices used for detection.” </p><p>“You have a point,” Maria admitted. “Those enchantments are complicated, and it wouldn’t take a lot to break them consistently.” </p><p>“Should we check them?” Eleanor asked. </p><p>“It’s a good way to validate the report before we mobilize the case. That way, we have another evidence for or against before mobilizing.” </p><p>“Are we sure we want to alert them?” I asked. </p><p>“What do you mean?” Maria said. “Does it matter? They will realize what’s going on once we mobilize either way.” </p><p>“No,” I said. “Are we sure we want to mobilize our forces openly?” </p><p>“What’s the alternative? Are we going to let the dungeon burst?” Eleanor asked. </p><p>Maria paused, her eyes widening after a second. “I see. Actually, it might not be a terrible idea,” she said. I smiled, while Eleanor looked shocked. </p><p>“You can’t be serious,” she said. </p><p>“Maybe. This is a mana-dead zone, so the danger-orienting from the dungeon shouldn’t be as bad. It’s probably something similar to ours. And, once it bursts, it’ll elevate the danger we’re in, but…” </p><p>“It won’t be as bad as splitting our forces and sacrificing our tactical flexibility,” I added. “The moment we spread our forces to two locations, we’ll give up strategic flexibility completely, and they can attack us however they wish.” </p><p>“What if the dungeon is more dangerous than we expect? Or, worse, it has a difficult-to-overcome ability like the corrosion we’re dealing with.” </p><p>“Easy,” I said. “We just need to send someone to check the dungeon, check the nature of the creatures, and understand if they pose any danger —” I started, only to pause. “Damn, I have to be the one to go, right?” I asked. </p><p>“No!” The answer came from both of them. “It’s too risky,” Maria continued. </p><p>“Not that risky. I have a good mixture of combat potential and mobility, and since I’m expected to be in the dungeon, my absence would go unnoticed,” I argued, which was the exact opposite of what I should be doing. They should be the ones who were pushing me to scout the area while I argued for my personal safety. </p><p>It was absurd, but it seemed like my new reality. </p><p>“But, what if something goes wrong? You’re strong, but…” Eleanor said, the silent implication being I was the weakest of the three of us. </p><p>“True,” I admitted, feeling no shame not being as strong as the two of them. I was closer to Eleanor, but as long as we were wearing comparable equipment, she was still better than me at a straight-up fight. “However, I’m not too far behind you, and we can’t send Maria to a secret mission alone.” </p><p>“Why not,” Maria argued. “I’m more capable than both of you, and as long as I bring along one of those crushers, I can replenish my mana easily.” </p><p>I said nothing, just turned at Eleanor. She coughed pointedly. “Well, you’re not exactly … sneaky,” she said. </p><p>“I can be sneaky,” Maria claimed. </p><p>“Not when you’re fighting,” Eleanor answered so that I didn’t have to. </p><p>“Fine,” Maria said, her pouting too childish for a woman who could do a convincing cosplay of a forest fire. “But, it still doesn’t mean that you should be the one to go.” </p><p>“No, it does,” I said. “Eleanor is right. What if the dungeon beasts come with a similar drawback. I’m the best candidate to assess it accurately.” </p><p>“Maybe both of you should go,” Maria countered. “I can hold the fort alone.”</p><p>Eleanor looked split at the suggestion, but luckily for her, she didn’t need to come to a decision. “No,” I said. “I’m sure she has spies who are watching her moves. Any long disappearance might alert them, and it’ll make it harder to approach the dungeon then. Going alone will give me better flexibility.” Eleanor looked ready to argue. </p><p>“And, we need you here to train the Farmers about the class,” I continued. “ I promised that I wouldn’t force them to upgrade early, but I still expect half of them to accept the offer and push for the class upgrade. We need you to train them to use their skills. We have three hundred spears ready, with some swords mixed in. It’ll be enough for them to use when leveling up.” </p><p>“Are you sure you want to leave?” Maria asked. </p><p>“That makes the most sense,” I admitted. “But, before leaving, let’s forge another five hundred spears just in case,” I added. </p><p>“In case of what?” Maria said, her tone sharp. </p><p>“In case I have to take a detour,” I replied, giving the most confident smile I could muster. “Don’t worry. I have every intention of coming back safely, but I will feel better if there’s no task waiting for me, forcing me into a disadvantageous timeline.” </p><p>They nodded, looking as frustrated as I was feeling. The last thing I wanted was to gallivant around, but unfortunately, the situation didn’t allow for anything else. </p>",

    "content": "<p>After another half a day filled with the most exciting of all sacred and forbidden arts — statistics — Maria let out a sudden, frustrated growl. “Alright, I surrender. Your theory about courage makes perfect sense,” she declared. </p><p>I had to admit, I was impressed by her development. She was getting impressively capable when it came to using various mathematical models, far better than any undergraduate student I had the pleasure of teaching. As for doctorate students, it was not exactly a fair comparison, as their general math competency needed to be quite high to be accepted to work with me. </p><p>Yes, Intelligence was helping her to do the calculations faster, but it didn’t give her instant comprehension, and unlike her, my students had the advantage of modern software suites. </p><p>“You have come a long way in merely a few days,” I said. </p><p>She shrugged. “What can I say, you’re a good teacher,” she said. </p><p>I chuckled. It was a rare compliment for me to receive even before the Cataclysm. I wanted to tease her about it, but too bad I wasn’t able to extract myself from the latest problem. </p><p>“Alright. I’m learning what that expression means. Spill,” she said. </p><p>I sighed as I pushed her two sets of hand-drawn graphs, displaying the relationship between various personality traits and skill improvement performance. “Check them first,” I said. </p><p>She did so, looking unaffected. “I don’t get it. It’s confirming what we had guessed. Brave people show better skill development.” </p><p>“Not that,” I said. “Do you mind creating another graph, but this time, I want you to graph only the standard deviation of every single personality trait we have surveyed for.” </p><p>“I don’t see the point…” she started, only to pause. “The variance for the people that manage to improve is much greater than the others,” she said. “But I have no idea what this implies. Something good? Something bad?” </p><p>“First, some background,” I said, wanting her to understand my point. “You have already seen the personality tests I had put as a part of the surveys I asked them to fill out,” I said. “The one I used here is based on the five-factor model, which is the one we had commonly used for our past experiments. It’s not perfect, but it's still sufficient enough to be used for most general-purpose research projects that rely on self-reporting.” </p><p>“Meaning, you’re familiar with the results it should have produced,” she said. </p><p>“Yes, and the variance for the people that’s unable to upgrade their skills is low. Absurdly low,” I said. </p><p>“How absurd?” </p><p>“Well, I have worked closely with several psychologist friends during my career, including some studies on how various personality scores are affected by being members of self-selecting groups with strong self-reinforcement effects. The groups we examined ranged from fraternities to social support groups, and we even managed to work with a couple of religious groups that technically qualified as cults.” </p><p>“And?” she asked. </p><p>“The results of these groups were significantly lacking the general variance of the society, but none was as unified as the Farmers that failed to upgrade their skills,” I said. “Frankly, if I wasn’t the one that administered the tests, I would have assumed that they were a practical joke.” </p><p>“What does it mean?” she asked. </p><p>“I have a wild theory, but before I go further, I want to apply the same process to the guards,” I said. </p><p>“We don’t have enough guards with Common skills,” she said. “We already gave every single one of them an Uncommon skill as a joining bonus.” </p><p>“And, unraveling my weapons that help them to improve their skills rapidly is too risky,” I continued, agreeing with her. “We need to be back in town to run that experiment,” I added. </p><p>“We can’t. Not with everything here,” she said. </p><p>“Not right now,” I admitted. “For the purposes of assisting Eleanor, the experiment could be declared tentatively successful. We can focus on more practical tests for the moment, like whether we could teach how to use Mana to one of the farmers.” </p><p>“Really?” she asked. </p><p>“Yeah. Eleanor is already able to use mana reasonably well, and we can’t delay it too much. Ultimately, the objective of the third-floor outpost is to validate whether a natural upgrade of the skills is a valid method. We have already confirmed the first part. Now, we just need to see if it can be applied to mana.” </p><p>“Really, that’s the objective of the whole outpost? How about hunting for more beasts,” she said. </p><p>“Well, that as well,” I said, waving my hand dismissively. While I appreciated the potential fortune and the welfare opportunity it represented intellectually, it hardly excited me on a personal level. “I have already identified a few candidates that are sharp enough to recognize this is a valuable opportunity and won’t blab about it easily,” I said. </p><p>“Do you want to bring them out immediately,” she asked. </p><p>“No, I would rather not. Not immediately,” I said. “Actually, I have a few questions for you first, about Meditation.” </p><p>Her expression tightened. For a moment, I was afraid that I had annoyed her by asking her about her secrets. “Why? Are you thinking about another suicidal experiment?” </p><p>“No,” I said, but under her gaze, I couldn’t help but wilt a little. “Not this time,” I said. “I promise.” </p><p>“Fine, but no experimenting without my presence, no matter how simple. Meditation isn’t as simple as it looks.” </p><p>“I promise,” I said, appreciating her concern even though the way her stern gaze lingered on me for a moment longer was annoying like I couldn’t be trusted. Then again, she did have a reason to fear that, right? “No experiments without you around.”</p><p>“Good,” she said, her posture relaxing slightly. “Now. Meditation isn't simple still. As the rarity improves, it starts to have a lot of variants that work better under certain situations, though the stat distribution helps as well. Some of them work better with Intelligence, while others are more fitting to be supported by Wisdom.” </p><p>“Any difference between the two,” I asked. </p><p>“Please no interruptions until the end of the class,” she said, though her smile showed it was more about mocking my teaching habits than anything else. Admittedly, another deserved blow. I chuckled. It was a good joke. “There are too many differences, but knowing how your mind works, you’re most interested in this: the ones reliant on Intelligence focus more on complicated shapes and rotation patterns that optimize the mana movement based on the environment, while Wisdom-based ones rely more on conceptual transformation.” </p><p>“Conceptual transformation?” I asked. </p><p>“Well, you had the Common one, and now you have the Cleansing Meditation. It’s a good example of the shape-dependent transformation, though it’s rarely used,” she said. </p><p>“Why?” I asked. </p><p>“Because, not everyone is crazy enough to optimize how to get mana out of dungeon products. They are too valuable to use like that by any sane person,” she said. </p><p>“So, does it mean it’s useless?” I asked. </p><p>“Not necessarily,” she said. “Though, it’s certainly specialized. Some dungeons, particularly in deeper levels, only contain mana deeply mixed with the taint. So, it’s still a popular choice for specialized dungeon explorers, especially since it works well enough with just Essence.” </p><p>“And, how about conceptual?” I asked. </p><p>“That works on a completely different principle,” she said. “Instead of a spell-like pattern, it often relies on a mental image of one strong concept, and then overlaps it with one’s center.” </p><p>“Patterns like what?” I asked.</p><p>“Well, it depends on the specific variant and the class, but I know some simple concepts like a raging fire, a calm lake, or an evening rain are all possibilities.” She interrupted me with a raised hand. “No, I don’t know much other than the general idea. Since my class is purely Intelligence-driven, I didn’t go any deeper. It’s just the nuggets from campfire chats as we attacked dungeons or tried to defend against monster waves. Nothing more.” </p><p>“So, no experimenting,” I said, realizing what she was driving at. </p><p>“No experimenting,” she said. “Not even with me. I wouldn’t even know where to start. As for the Intelligence-based meditation … it’s harder to describe. It constantly shifts according to the environment, not unlike a combat skill. It’s hard to explain.” </p><p>“Hmm,” I said, pausing. “How about writing it as a formula?” </p><p>“As a formula? How?” she said. </p><p>“Good question,” I said. “You remember my experiments with the hexagons,” I said. </p><p>“You can’t be serious. That doesn’t even begin to describe the complexity of it.” </p><p>“I know. That’s just where we start, and even with more empirical evidence, I could hardly build a reliable model of mana flow as a function of fluid dynamics. It’s very far from my area of expertise. But, as long as we get a general basis, it should work.” </p><p>“Do you think it will?” </p><p>“There’s no reason it shouldn’t,” I said, which, admittedly, was quite a bit of optimism. “And, even if we fail, spending a few days studying mathematics is never a loss.” </p><p>That earned a chuckle from her, before I started giving her a crash course on topology and algebraic geometry. It was a lesson I would have happily extended for a few days, but merely a few hours into our new topic, we were interrupted by Eleanor rushing from the keep. </p><p>And, she was too fast for someone bearing good news.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The temptation to start playing with my skills to see the impact of the most recent discovery was difficult to resist but I managed to hold on and focused on the problem that was most urgent, with the data available to me. </p><p>What determined whether people could advance their skills naturally or not? </p><p>The data I had managed to collect, along with the other observations, suggested that it was not an accident. It seemed like there were some seriously strong correlations in terms of certain behavior patterns, like being outspoken, taking initiative, and general courage.  </p><p>But, I did my best not to make a rash judgment. The correlation was clear, but one statement held true. Correlation didn’t equal causation. A simple sentence, but very hard to comprehend, and very dangerous when not applied properly.</p><p>Therefore, I ignored my desire to come to a quick conclusion just because I had noticed a beautiful statistical link and instead started to outline all the different analyses I needed to run once Maria returned, and how to process the data I got from Eleanor. Which variables to dig deep into, the possible causation links, and the data required to prove them… everything. </p><p>I was on the first floor, taking a large pile of notes, sitting at the same hilltop that we had used for other experiments, enough to make me glad that Dexterity also helped with the speed of my handwriting significantly. </p><p>I probably worked on the data for more than half a day, deciding all the ways to dice the survey results when I got interrupted by the arrival of Maria and Eleanor. </p><p>“Wow, you look busy,” Eleanor started as she arrived at the hilltop in one smooth jump, even swatching her giving me a sense of vertigo, carrying Maria at the same time. </p><p>“There’s a lot of data to go through,” I said. </p><p>She looked at it, but then I caught a hesitant glance on her face. “Would you be angry if I told you all your work here kind of went to waste,” she said. </p><p>I looked at her, suddenly afraid. “What do you mean?” I asked, afraid that she would admit tempering with the data as a joke or something equally asinine. Over my career, I had to deal with that particular ‘joke’ a few times during my career, by people who didn’t understand that I would have been more accepting if they set my bed on fire … while I was sleeping on it. </p><p>“Well … I kind of already solved the mystery of skill upgrades.” </p><p>“And, you expect me to be angry about it?” I asked, looking surprised. </p><p>“Yeah,” she added hesitantly, looking surprised. Next to her, Maria had a similar expression. </p><p>I chuckled. “The whole point of what we’re doing is to discover something. If you actually solved it, I’ll be happy.” </p><p>“Really?” she asked. </p><p>“Of course. Especially since we’re not working for a university that would fire me because I don’t have my name on the paper,” I added, shivering slightly. Publish or perish culture had been scarier than the dungeon monsters. </p><p>“That’s an admirable perspective,” Maria added. </p><p>“So, what’s this solved mystery?” I asked. </p><p>“It’s the dungeon,” Eleanor declared confidently. </p><p>“Really?” I asked. </p><p>“Easy,” she said. “I have helped five hundred farmers to improve their skills as you asked. Eighty percent of the ones that entered the dungeon had managed to get the skill upgrade, while the ones that did not, only thirty percent achieved it.” </p><p>“How about the nearest town?” </p><p>“Even better. Only ten percent of them succeeded,” she said. “It proves that …” she said, but then paused. “Right?” she added, probably due to my soft smile. </p><p>“Not exactly,” I said as I gestured for her to sit down. “What you have discovered here is called correlation, as in the relationship between two numbers. That's not enough to conclude that something in the dungeon allows them to break through their skill.” </p><p>“I don’t get it,” she said. </p><p>“It’s normal,” I said. “What you did is common sense, and for most cases, it’s enough to go through life. We take what we know, and link them together. Let me give you an old-world example, what would you say if I said ice cream caused heat strokes? If we check the data, the more ice cream sold, the more people are admitted to hospital.” </p><p>“That it’s total nonsense, of course,” she said. “People eat more ice cream when it’s hot outside. But, that’s obvious.” </p><p>“True,” I said. “But, you know that because it’s an example where we know why people get heat strokes. However, what if you don’t know the link in the first place. What if I told you that children who know how to play an instrument get into better colleges. Does it mean learning an instrument makes people smarter? Or just that they come from richer households that can afford to send them to private lessons. Or, maybe admission committees like it on their CVs.” </p><p>This time, both of them frowned. “But, it makes sense,” Maria interrupted. </p><p>“It does, because dungeons mean faster leveling and a lot of resources. Dungeons somehow influencing the level cap is believable as well,” I added. </p><p>“You don’t believe it,” Eleanor said, sharp enough to see what I was getting at. </p><p>“No, I don’t,” I said. “I have my own hypothesis about why.” </p><p>“And, what makes yours better?” she asked, challenging. </p><p>I liked her tone. “Nothing,” I admitted. </p><p>“Nothing?” she said. </p><p>“Well, nothing at the moment. What we both have is a bunch of observations, run through our common sense. It makes a good hypothesis, but that’s it.”</p><p>“Then, what do we do now?” she said. </p><p>“Well, there’s a reason I made them fill all those surveys. We’re going to check all the data and see if we can find some stronger correlation, and from there, start designing experimental and observational setups that might discover the causation —” I said, then I noticed that Eleanor looked ashamed. “Don’t tell me,” I gasped.  </p><p>Her bag wasn’t big enough to hold all the surveys I had asked her to collect. </p><p>“Don’t worry, I collected them all. I just didn’t bring them with me, and left them at home.” </p><p>I let out a relieved sigh. “That’s good,” I admitted. </p><p>“Does it mean I have to go to the town and collect them?” I just nodded. “Not fun,” she complained. </p><p>“Well, that’s only if you want your mana skill. If you don’t…” </p><p>“Fine,” she grumbled before she left, leaving me alone with Maria. </p><p>Maria waited until Eleanor was far away before she started speaking. “You seemed pretty confident when you dismissed Eleanor’s assumption. Why?” </p><p>“Because of the same patterns I had noticed while helping the group at the third-floor outpost level up. Did you know the more outspoken they are, the higher their rate of skill upgrade appears,” I said. </p><p>“That’s …” </p><p>“Silly, absurd, nonsense?” I completed her sentences. </p><p>She blushed slightly. “Well, something along those lines. You’re claiming that the more courageous they are, the easier for the skills to upgrade.” </p><p>“Well, yes and no,” I said. “There seems to be a strong correlation that explains a lot, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it turns out to be complete nonsense.”  </p><p>“What a waste of time,” she said, then paused. “Sorry. It just feels like…” </p><p>“A lot of wasted effort,” I added. She nodded sheepishly. “Don’t worry about it. It’s not an insult. There’s no scientist that hasn't come up with hundreds of nonsense, absolutely stupid ideas with absolutely nothing to do with reality, that any sane person wouldn’t have entertained for a second, achieving nothing but wasted time.” </p><p>“And, that’s useful?” </p><p>“Yes, because, occasionally, some of those ideas lead to the discovery of a fungus that can kill bacteria, saving billions of lives.” </p><p>“And, how do we separate those groundbreaking ones from hundreds of nonsensical claims?” </p><p>“We come to the fun part of science. There’s no easy way. We will constantly build hypotheses, check the data, validate results, and start with a new set all along, all the while hoping that we’re going in the right direction.” </p><p>“Sounds inefficient.” </p><p>“It is. Science is a lot like prospecting. A structured approach means that, instead of just digging blindly, you use advanced methods to check the ground. But, no matter how advanced your methods, you can’t find anything if there’s nothing there.” </p><p>“And, you are hopeful that courage is the answer for it. And, you can’t be serious in expecting the results in Eleanor’s data.” </p><p>“Actually, I somewhat did,” I admitted. “It’s a little more complicated than that. But, before I go deeper, let me share with you an interesting anecdote. Back in the old world, children born in the first three months are almost twice as likely to become a pro than the ones born from October to December.” </p><p>She frowned. “If you come to me with some horoscope nonsense—” she started. </p><p>I chuckled. “Not in the slightest. The mechanism is simple. We have split youth leagues based on age, which meant, from an absolute perspective, children born in January always had several months of development advantage. It means they get better opportunities, which snowballs into an overrepresentation.” </p><p>“And, how does it link back to the great difference between the ones that have accessed the dungeon, and those who did not?” she asked. </p><p>“Simple. It’s a tainted sample, similar to youth leagues. The farmers that joined us are volunteers.” </p><p>“The ones that are brave enough to leave the city and potentially risk themselves in a new town, joining people they knew nothing about,” Maria completed. </p><p>“Exactly,” I said even as I pushed a thick stack of papers in front of her. </p><p>“Are these your conclusions or something?” she asked. </p><p>I laughed. “No. Those are all the different analyses that we need to run. Each page describes an analysis, the method of calculation, and possible follow-ups based on the results.” </p><p>“B-but, there has to be at least five hundred pages here,” she said. “Even with Intelligence, it’ll take hours.” </p><p>“Yes,” I smiled, feeling excited that I was finally doing proper research work. “Isn’t science fun?”</p>",

Safety first,” I added, which finished the long list of guidelines I wanted them to follow.</p><p>“Yes, sir,” they responded in concert, and for a moment, I felt like I was back in the classroom, and hit by nostalgia. Amusingly, I had always hated teaching in the classroom, treating the education of the undergraduates similar to a necessary chore like paperwork. </p><p>It was amusing that what I treated as a chore could turn into a fond memory. Benefits of a literal apocalypse, I supposed. </p><p>Though, that nostalgic feeling was not an accident. What I had initially planned to be a twenty-minute long tutorial had turned into a three-hour-long monster orientation session similar to what I held for every batch of grad students. </p><p>Despite the reminiscence I had felt, I made sure to take multiple breaks, giving them time to discuss and recover, and I used the gap to check the first two floors. It was fun to teach again, but I didn’t want to neglect security just because I was doing something comfortable. </p><p>And, to their credit, it looked like they learned what I was trying to teach better than a bunch of post-docs with over-exaggerated senses of their own importance in the world. </p><p>“Everything clear?” I asked. They said nothing, but I caught a few hesitant glares. “I’m not going to get angry if you missed something, or want some clarification,” I said. “None of you are children, and I don’t want to treat you as such.” </p><p>Even with that guarantee, it took a while for one of them to raise a hand and ask a question. “How are we going to check people’s Health?” he asked. “We don’t have any skills to do that.”  </p><p>“Good question,” I said. “You don’t need to keep an accurate measure. Just roughly keep an eye on the impact, and occasionally remind them about the security.” They looked surprised, but I had a feeling it was less about the answer, and more about the delivery. </p><p>One problematic thing regarding the prevalent Feudal perspective was that people didn’t really appreciate questions from their ‘lessers’. Though, once again, I wasn’t sure how much I could blame I could put on the System, and how much of it generally fell onto our general human nature. </p><p>After all, I had seen many of my coworkers acting like they were insulted when asked questions. And, they were professors. Answering questions was an explicit part of their job descriptions. </p><p>That triggered a wave of question and answer, covering everything I had been speaking about during the last three hours. That was good news. It showed that they had listened. It was always a pleasant surprise to see students actually listen and learn, rather than sleeping in the class until the exam week before panicking about exam questions. </p><p>The Q&amp;A session lasted equally long. “Then, let me ask a question of my own,” I said. They tensed, which made me chuckle. “Don’t worry. It’s easy. How do you make those flowers bloom with such incredible colors?” </p><p>They looked at me, surprised. “What do you mean, sir? We just … do?” </p><p>“Yes, but what are the steps that you follow?” I asked. “Do you let the flower glow first before focusing on the color? Or, is there a way to combine the two?” </p><p>All of them looked at me, surprised. Well, not all of them, I corrected. Just most of them. “Sir?” Terry spoke. “It might be different for advanced combat skills, but that’s not how Nurture works.” </p><p>“Maybe there’s a difference between an external skill and a class skill,” I said. “Explain to me how you do it.” </p><p>“I create an image and impose the changes I want. And, the skill handles the rest,” he said, like talking about how to breathe. </p><p>“And, is this like this for all of you?” I asked. They shared hesitant glances. “I’m asking, because, for me, it’s more like a numbered action list,” I said. </p><p>“Mine is more similar to that,” one of them admitted, then three others joined. </p><p>I paused for a moment, feeling shocked and annoyed at the equal measure. “S-sir,” Terry spoke, hesitant. I noticed the others looked at me, looking tense. </p><p>“It’s nothing you did,” I said. “I just realized I had missed something fundamental. Let me think about it for a minute,” I said as I stood up, and started walking. </p><p>Moving helped whenever I dealt with it. </p><p>After three years of trying to study the implications of the System, I realized that, not for once, had I asked any questions regarding how other people interacted with the System, assuming that it was the same way for all. For me, it was almost a step-by-step action list, one that I could modify as I wished. </p><p>I had just assumed that everyone worked the same way. </p><p>In a way, it reminded me of the time I had learned about aphantasia, which meant some people were utterly unable to imagine something visually. It was a condition that was about brain development, which meant people who belonged to that category couldn’t picture anything visually. </p><p>Of course, just because it reminded me of aphantasia didn’t mean that it was fundamental. Maybe it was just some kind of habit. And, there was a chance that it didn’t affect anything. And, even if it did, the discovery was something beneficial. </p><p>No, I was annoyed, because after three years of trying to study the System, I hadn’t even thought about questioning people about it. </p><p>Admittedly, the way people perceived the world was not something we questioned often, and even if we did, finding the right questions could be difficult. It was why, let alone complicated, abstract conditions like aphantasia, even simpler ones with actual life impact like color blindness or dyslexia could be challenging to discover. </p><p>However, it was a good lesson. Just because I had achieved some success in my solo research didn’t mean it was the best way to develop. </p><p>I chuckled. Just yesterday, I was smugly explaining to Maria about the importance of cooperation for science and human development. And, today, an impromptu workshop that I had treated as a chore — an important chore, but a chore nonetheless — allowed me to make a major realization about the way we interacted with the System. </p><p>Admittedly, I had no evidence to believe that it would be important. Maybe, ultimately, it would be as trivial as aphantasia — at least, to my knowledge as a layman, as I was not a neuroscience expert — or maybe, it would prove to be fundamental. </p><p>But, regardless, it represented an avenue of research. </p><p>And, it was time for the first experiment. </p><p>“Alright, sorry for the interruption,” I said as I returned. “Terry, you were telling me how to change the color of a flower,” I said. </p><p>“Yes,” he said, hesitant. Still, he went through his simplistic explanation again, while another one passed me a flower seed. I placed it on the ground, closed my eyes, and imagined how it would look once it grew. </p><p>A simple flower, with alternating white and black leaves. </p><p>[-4 Health]</p><p>It was a different feeling, as if I was trying to force a square peg through a round hole. Disorienting, but nowhere as disorienting as trying to quickly switch skills. </p><p>Or worse, trying to reverse Meditation. </p><p>When I opened my eyes, a flower of my exact specifications greeted me. I couldn’t help but smile at my success. </p><p>“Very good sir,” they congratulated me, but I could see that it was more about my position than the achievement. Not that I blamed them. It wasn’t the fact that they could do better, but also they had seen me raising a small forest in one breath. Compared to that, a little multicolored flower was not exactly a great achievement. </p><p>I ignored them as I repeated the same experiment, but this time, imagining white leaves, with little black straight lines going across. </p><p>[-4 Health]</p><p>This time, the results weren’t as impressive. The leaves were mostly white, but with most of the black straight lines had instead come out as gray blotches. However, the failure made me smile even more. </p><p>Was this the difference between me and the other blacksmiths when it came to modifying recipes and switching out steps? Maybe, maybe not… Either way, it was something to be followed up on later. </p><p>I thought about my team of pseudo-assistants, thinking about asking them to repeat the same test, maybe even repeat it for all two thousand. But, after a moment of deliberation, I decided against it. I was already asking them something outside of their comfort zone, and from experience, I knew that adding too many items to that list could backfire. </p><p>“Thank you, Terry. It was very helpful,” I said, which made him smile. Positive reinforcement was a critical weapon for any educator. “Now, I think I have burdened you with enough extra tasks. Why don’t I leave and let you go on ahead with them.” </p><p>“Thank you, sir,” they said as they stood up and dispersed. </p><p>I was happy to see them act more confidently in my presence. They were slowly stopping to act like they expected me to flip at them for the smallest mistake like an incompetent sergeant. </p><p>However, while that made me happy, my mind shifted back to my latest discovery the moment I left the camp, measuring the relative merits of the two approaches. The benefits of mine were clear. Without that systemic approach that dissected the System feedback into smaller steps, I could have never achieved what I did. </p><p>But, it was clear that their method had advantages as well. And, it was for me to find out how to maximize it for every skill. </p><p>As soon as I finished some of my ongoing projects… </p>",

    "content": "<p>I wanted to talk with Terry, but I didn’t approach him for two reasons. First, singling out someone like that in a complicated situation was a bad idea. It already caused problems in my undergrad classes when I was a professor, and the current situation was far more complicated than a classroom. </p><p>Also, I wasn’t entirely sure that he would be a good candidate for the task I had in mind yet. I thought he was, but I had the luxury of time, at least until I could reach the next stage, and see if pushing them to Epic level was a viable option. </p><p>So, after stopping by Harold and asking him to gather them on the outskirts, I went to the fourth floor again. This time, I didn’t just bring the poisoned water from the swamp, but also the concentrated variants from the condenser, each bucket labeled with the concentration percentages. </p><p>“I need to upgrade it,” I said to myself on the way back. The machine was enough for my purposes, but not for two thousand farmers. I could just build up twenty copies to handle the consumption, but optimizing the design with Maria’s help seemed like the much better option. </p><p>When I returned, all two thousand of them had been gathered, their expressions ranging from excited to anxious. “There are some changes at the outpost,” I started. “I have never seen a dungeon so beautiful.” Some of them smiled, but even more of them tensed, as if they were afraid that I would follow with some kind of punishment. “Excellent work. Keep it up.” </p><p>It was good to see them relax, but the intensity alone was enough to show the extent of their terrible relationship with authority. Not that I blamed them. I partially blamed the System, but an even bigger fault was ours. As humanity, we were following our usual pattern of climbing over the downtrodden, uncaring of what we could achieve if only we were willing to give up a fraction of our selfish desires.</p><p>A part of me wanted to talk to them, tell them that they could feel safe here. However, I did not. First of all, I wasn’t entirely sure if that was a promise I could fulfill. The world we lived in was a dangerous place, and for all my improvements, I was still a character at the periphery. Just one person over level hundred would have been enough to demolish everything I had built with ease. </p><p>Then, there was the more practical reason. There was nothing that put people more on edge than someone insisting that they were safe, and he could be trusted.  </p><p>“You know the drill,” I called. “Twenty volunteers first, fill out the surveys, and let’s see how far we can push those skills,” I called. </p><p>As they lined up, a hand rose. “Go ahead,” I said. </p><p>“S-sir. S-should we join as well?” he asked. </p><p>“When you say we you mean..?” I asked. </p><p>“T-the ones that failed to upgrade their skills,” he stammered. </p><p>“Sure, there’s no harm,” I called. “Just make sure to fill the surveys correctly. And, don’t worry, even if you can’t achieve it, I’ll eventually get Rare skill stones for every single one of you. It’ll just take longer.” </p><p>He nodded, as if speaking that had consumed all his willpower. The promise relaxed him, but not significantly. I watched a group of them gather together, noting that they acted significantly meeker than the others. </p><p>I noted it down, and wanted to check the surveys accordingly. It might be just about them feeling depressed, or it might be something important. </p><p>However, for the moment, I ignored it, and focused on teaching them how to use the different concentrations of poison and fertilizer to improve. With my own experience as a guide, calculating the ideal number of drops and the sequence was trivial. I just needed to solve a partial differential equation to decide which level of concentrate was appropriate for each skill level, optimizing the usage. </p><p>The amount that had been accumulated showed that it should be barely enough to bring everyone to Epic, but it was not enough to allow them to develop there. Which seemed like it would be a problem as the first twenty volunteers started to report their success. </p><p>Of the twenty, twelve of them managed to upgrade their skill. </p><p>“Very good,” I called, even as I started to tackle the latest problem, and how to increase the production of both the fertilizer and the stronger poison concentrates as much as possible. Not that it caused any frustration. It was a very good problem to have. </p><p>Unfortunately, it turned out that I got excited prematurely. The first volunteers had managed to achieve the desired rate, for the rest of the eighteen hundred with Rare Nurture, the success rate was slightly more than two percent. </p><p>I was disappointed, yet excited at the same time. Disappointed, because a thousand Farmers with Epic skills would unlock so many steps for the future, with great strategic importance. </p><p>Excited, because the difference was too big, and the sample was too large for it to be just a statistical glitch. It meant that there was a link between the act of volunteering and the ability to rank up. </p><p>“Good performance, everyone,” I called as the fifty farmers that had managed to reach Epic Nurture without skill stones gathered to the side, while the rest looked disappointed. “Now, for the ones that failed to improve, you have a choice. You can choose to upgrade your class and start fighting, or you can choose to delay your progress. You’re free to choose either, with no consequence. Your places in the outpost are not in danger either way.” </p><p>It wasn’t the best way to conduct a healthy experiment. A part of me wanted to split them randomly, and assign every single one of them a task. That way, I could conduct a proper blind study. </p><p>But, I couldn’t forget that, for them, it was a choice that would permanently affect their lives. And, the least I could provide was to give them a choice. “Don’t be in a hurry to decide,” I called once I realized some of them were panicking. “Even if you want to level up, you can wait until tomorrow.” </p><p>“What if we choose to wait, but still can’t improve further, what then?” another asked. </p><p>“Nothing,” I said. “There’s absolutely no consequence for delaying. If it changes, I’ll personally help you in your leveling journeys,” I promised. </p><p>“What if all of us choose to delay,” one of them said. </p><p>I shrugged. “Then you’ll stay here for six months and we work together to understand why it doesn’t work,” I said. “Even then, I’ll help you break through level twenty-five before you leave the dungeon, as long as it is what you want.” </p><p>I heard a scoff, one that came from one of the fifty that had managed to reach Epic. It was a woman in her early fifties as far as I could tell. “And, are we supposed to believe that you’re doing all of it for nothing?” she asked. </p><p>I couldn’t help but smile at her abrasive tone. Unfortunately, any entertaining answer that I could give was prevented by the presence of two thousand farmers listening to us. Not because I was afraid of a riot or something, but the exact opposite. They flinched in fear and looked at the old lady, like she had just opened the door for a serial killer. </p><p>“Of course not,” I said. “I have my own conditions for allowing such freedoms,” I said. “I want you to gather as a group every day, discuss all the new ways you can use Nurture, and write them down,” I said. </p><p>Everyone looked surprised. “That’s it?” the woman asked. </p><p>“If it’s not, you’ll learn in the future. Now, disperse,” I answered, my voice abrasive, as if she had touched a secret. She did not, nor was I feeling angry. The opposite. Unfortunately, I could see that the rest of the Farmers were panicking. </p><p>Claiming that I had some unspecified orders for the future calmed them down. </p><p>I could see where they were coming from. Sometimes, the free gifts came at the greatest of costs. I wanted to sit down and explain to them how important their help was for me, and what could be potentially achieved, but I held my mouth. Instead, I acted like I had a hidden agenda. </p><p>Though, I paused. Considering I was preparing them to defend the town against some unspecified threat, it was not exactly a lie, was it? </p><p>As the rest dispersed, I closed my eyes, doing my best to ignore my guilt. I didn’t want to be responsible for the lives of thousands of people, but yet stupidly, I had already taken that responsibility upon myself. And, now, it was too late to change my mind.  </p><p>I just needed to do my best. </p><p>Once they dispersed, I turned to the fifty that had managed to attain the Epic variant, trying to decide the best way to explain to them how to continue progressing with their skill. The amount of swamp poison and fertilizer wasn’t enough for them to push to the limit of Epic, but any progress they made would be useful. </p><p>“I want one thing from all of you,” I said as I looked at them. “Since you have the  Epic skill, you’re responsible for the practice groups,” I said. “But, don’t forget to take notes on the process.” </p><p>A hand rose. It was Terry. “And, how would we do that, sir?” he asked. </p><p>“Good point,” I said. “Pick something to take notes on, and gather around.” </p><p>It looked like I was about to give a lecture. </p><p>It had been a while. </p>",
