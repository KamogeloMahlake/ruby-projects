    "content": "<p>Laura felt her face blush deeply, unable to believe what she had just asked, followed by a desperate mortification as she felt his hands on her shoulders, gently pushing away. She closed her eyes, ready to dash away, but when she tried to stand up, she realized his hands were preventing her from the sweet release of escape. “Laura, look at me,” Mark said in a clear tone, one that tickled her insides and caused heat to pool between her legs, something she had never felt before, at least not without the assistance from a little buzzing toy. </p><p>“Mark, I’m sorry,” she murmured as she opened her eyes, afraid of what she would find in his eyes. She expected anger, disgust, or worst, an indulgent expression an adult might wear while looking at a silly portrait done by a child. </p><p>But she found an inscrutable expression. It wasn’t anger, dismissal, or disgust, but also it wasn’t arousal —which would have been a normal response from a man in his thirties being propositioned by a barely-legal girl, even if she was as plain as Laura, or at least, she thought so. Even fear or shock about the age difference wouldn’t have been a surprise. </p><p>But no, instead, he had a serious expression on his face, like he was considering her proposal with a calm seriousness, something that threw Laura off more than her own impulsive question, asking him to teach her about the pleasures of the body. “Mark?” she repeated, her voice trembling, whether with anticipation or shock she didn’t know. The longer she failed to decipher his expression, the more confused she got. </p><p>Mark took a deep breath, which sent a wave of confusion through her. “Laura, you’re my friend, so I’m going to treat you with the respect you deserve-” he started, and she immediately felt a wave of dejection filling her heart, preparing herself to a rejection, harsher in its kindness. She expected it. It wasn’t a reasonable thing to ask from a friend in the first place —especially when the said friend was sculpted like an adonis, just a wink away from creating an actual harem around himself— but it did little to soften the blow. </p><p>She opened her mouth, about to cut his words to save himself from the worst of the humiliation, but his gaze tightened just a touch more, effectively silencing her. He started speaking in a soft tone, like he was trying to talk to a skittish mare. “I want you to take your car, go home, and really think about whether what you asked is what you want,” he said, which was enough to freeze her thoughts. </p><p>She just looked at him as she tried to restart her mind, only to fail as spectacularly as when she tried to restart her wreck of a car during a snowstorm. His answer was going in a much different direction than she had been expecting. “Really?” she uttered. </p><p>He just continued speaking in the same calming tone. “Take your time until you’re sure, and it’s better if you keep the distance while you think, just to make sure you make your decision with a clear mind. If you really decide it’s what you want, I’ll help you. If you change your mind, you just need to send me a text about it, and I’ll never mention it again. Would that work for you?” </p><p>“Y-yeah,” Laura stammered as she examined his chiseled face, much more attractive than she had ever seen. </p><p>“You need to keep in mind that I’m not looking for anything that might be classified as a relationship in any traditional sense, so, your final decision needs to keep that factored in,” he finished as he loosened his touch on her shoulder and took a step back.  </p><p>Laura couldn’t help but be shocked, but her shock was filled with a strange kind of warmth. Despite the calm yet methodical tone he used, he was kind. More importantly, it was the first time she felt like she was being treated like a true adult; not an overeager teenager like most professors, not an incompetent disaster like her mother, not even like a fragile flower that might have broken if treated wrongly —impressive, considering he had already seen her break into hysterics for more than one occasion and knew about her addiction history. </p><p>Despite everything in her life, he respected her as an adult, but still shown kindness to her by giving her an easy exit that wouldn’t force her to make a decision. </p><p>“Okay, Mark, but on one condition,” Laura said with more confidence than she was feeling. Mark nodded, the slightest smile on his lips. “I want you to give me your address, so I can visit you when I finally make my decision, no matter what. I owe you to tell you that face to face rather than messaging like a coward.” </p><p>“If that’s your wish, princess,” Mark said with a soft smile, his tone much warmer. Laura blushed, but also happy with the fact that he didn’t reiterate his point, trusting her to understand the implications.</p><p>Now, all she needed was to gather enough courage to pull back her request without humiliating herself. </p><p>That was what she wanted to do, right? Anything else would have been ridiculous.</p><p>*****     *****     *****     *****     *****     </p><p>It was the Thursday evening, a full week after the day Laura had broken her relationship with her annoying waste-of-space boyfriend who hid an acrid, evil personality behind his free-loving persona. A full week after she had run into his arms, asking for his help for a very unusual subject. </p><p>Laura wanted to blame Mark for the discomfort she was feeling. Why couldn’t Mark be a classical male hero and stole his lips mercilessly, conveniently taking the weight of decision from her hands? Or at least, laugh at her face before dismissing her, freeing from the weight of making a decision with a more painful ending. </p><p>Okay, Laura respected him for his unique response, but it didn’t change the fact that it left her with a huge decision that she felt ashamed to conclude. Offering to start a casual sexual relationship with a good friend —effectively, her best friend in her current social pariah days after rehab— without anything to make it easier —like a few bottles of wine shared between them— wasn’t as easy as Laura had thought. For the whole week, she got anxious, excited, sad, panicked, and experienced emotions that weren’t even possible as she went back and forth between pulling back her request and going forward.</p><p>After all, it was not a simple thing to start. She was aware that, despite what he might have said, it had the potential to derail their friendship —and as much as she didn’t want to admit, she was self-aware enough to confess that she was the likely source of the problem for that. The smart thing to do was to swallow her pride and accept that she made a mistake, apologize, and beg him to forget that ever happened. </p><p>However, that wouldn’t remove the problem. She was too inexperienced when it came to the matters of the body, and she didn’t want to continue making bad decisions just because a boy had an attractive body. Her life was far too fragile to trust a random boy with her body.  </p><p>She was a smart and ambitious young woman that trusted herself. So, she felt rather shameful admitting —even in her mind— that, in the end, it was Mark’s body that did the trick. It wasn’t his spectacular body he sculpted through endless hours in the gym or handsome his face that finalized her decision —though they certainly didn’t hurt. </p><p> It was the way Mark stood, confident like a mountain, like nothing could penetrate his confidence despite the fact that he was in a community college —for some unknown reason. There was a lot of gossip about that, of course, most of them claiming that he had been disbarred as a lawyer for one reason or other, from violating the ethics guidelines to sleeping with a judge. Even though it was believable —especially the last option— Laura had trouble believing that. </p><p>Mark was far too self-possessed, too confident to have been disbarred.  </p><p>Still, Laura wanted to replicate that self-confidence, hoping to calm herself without the external validation of a string of A’s. And maybe, if she spent more time with Mark, she could get a sliver of his confidence. </p><p>Her mind stopped wandering as she drove toward Mark’s address, because she could feel the gazes from the other cars. She couldn’t blame them. Her car was starting to get more and more noticeable in the traffic, as the roads were filled with brand new imported cars, reminding her of a car show. Mark’s apartment was in the nicest part of the town, yet another evidence against the disbarment. </p><p>Even then, Laura was surprised about his living situation, as even the monthly maintenance charge there was more than her rent, which meant it shouldn’t be affordable for an ex-lawyer —whether he quit or disbarred— unless he was willing to burn through his savings recklessly. And no matter how nonchalant he acted at times, Laura didn’t think Mark was careless with his money. He was too in control to deplete his savings for his reputation.</p><p>Or at least, she assumed so.  </p><p>Lost in thoughts, she almost missed the turn to her building. Panic bloomed in her heart as she pulled into the nearest available visitor parking. It was the last chance for her to pull out, and that was only because she didn’t even call him before. She had promised that she would tell him face to face, but still, maybe she should have? </p><p>“Be brave, Laura,” she murmured herself as she stepped out of her car, tightening her trenchcoat around herself to make sure nothing was out of order, trying to reject the temptation to bite her lips, afraid of ruining her makeup. Then, she entered the building, and saw that there was an actual doorman in place. Just how expensive was this place. </p><p>“Laura, guest to apartment 22B,” she murmured as she slid her ID forward, hoping that a call from the reception would be enough warning for Mark. </p><p>“You can go,” said the doorman said after taking a couple of notes on the open ledger in front of him. </p><p>“Aren’t you going to call him for permission?” Laura asked, trembling in surprise. She had been hoping that he would call, giving him the warning. It shouldn’t be a problem, but it was. Calling him directly was not an option, not after she had already arrived at his building. </p><p>“No need, you’re already registered as a guest,” he explained, and suddenly, Laura felt her mouth dry. Mark was expecting her upstairs, enough to already register as a guest. She didn’t know whether to feel excited to stressed about the trust, as she could have easily stumbled at him spending time with another woman, but still, he just allowed her to access. </p><p>She should have still called. </p><p>She didn’t. </p><p>She nodded at the doorman before stepping into the elevator. Her reflection looked back at her from the mirror, which sent another wave of thrill through her body. The reflection showed nothing more than a bulky trench coat, a bit unnecessary considering the weather, but it did its job. Her make-up was thicker than she had usually preferred, applying red and black rather than her usual pastel colors. She wanted to look older. </p><p>Laura walked toward the door, and when she rang the doorbell, she was beset with a desire to pull her arms tight, or even better, dash away before Mark could open the door. It was the last chance for her to pull back. But she was frozen in indecision, unable to react fast enough. </p><p>Then the door opened, revealing Mark. She felt her breath hitch. A part of it was about the shock she felt and the stress of the moment, but the most belonged to the amazing sight that was revealed. Mark was wearing nothing more than a sleeveless shirt that displayed his arms to perfection, his muscles glistening under the dim lights of his apartment. </p><p>She wanted to escape once more, this time intimidated by the sheer perfection of the sight in front of her. She knew that he was well-built, but she had never seen him without a dress shirt. Even in her dreams —hot, bothered, and very frequent during last week— she imagined that it was under his shirt. He said nothing for an almost full minute, examining her while she tried to look anywhere other than his face. Maybe it was the last attempt to test her resolve.</p><p>If so, she was about to fail.  </p><p>Then, he spoke. “Would you like to come in, princess?” he said as he took a side step, giving her just enough space to enter. </p><p>She did so, aware that her life was about to change… </p>",

    "content": "<p>“So, what was the cost of their arrogance,” I asked, trying to ignore the fact that I had detected another Divine spark in the room, though I had no idea about the exact location. The confirmation about the existence of the gods —not to mention a tale of war between the mortals and immortals— was revolutionary enough to earn my full attention. </p><p>“Yeah, humans got arrogant, big surprise,” she murmured, giving a statement that would have surprised me if I hadn’t already discovered her true identity. “The Eternals decided that since they were able to banish one of the strongest demonic gods from the material plane, they thought that they could replicate the feat. They started to target the other gods…” </p><p>“And I’m going to take a wild guess and say that gods didn’t appreciate that,” I said mockingly. </p><p>“No, they did not, especially when they decided to weaponize the leftover divinity from the destruction of the Avatar and the Divine war began,” she continued, struggling to keep her tone even, but unable to keep a small hint of emotion infecting her tone, a certain wistfulness, leading me to take a wild guess that she wasn’t actually lived through the war. It was more of an instinctual guess than anything concrete, but at this point, I had learned to trust my instincts on the subject of female emotions. </p><p>The more important topic, however, was to decide how much I needed to fake. I could have acted as I knew about her historical facts like I knew about the mysterious organization, but there was one big problem in that. There were too many opportunities for her to slip an inaccurate statement to test me. One wrong nod would be enough to unravel my utter lack of historical knowledge. </p><p>“Interesting, and how does the System link to that,” I asked, not hiding my curiosity, basically admitting that I knew little about history. Also, I knew that doing so would have lessened the weight of my own organization greatly, but that was not all bad. If she reduced the threat level of my imaginary organization, she might push harder to recruit me. And as much as I was afraid of being </p><p>“You don’t know?” she asked, though, at this point, I was familiar enough with her fake voice to recognize the fakeness of her surprise. Apparently, she was already suspecting the limited nature of my knowledge. </p><p>“Not particularly, no,” I answered. “My organization is not really keen on the history, more focused on protecting our little corner of the world from meddling busybodies like the Eternals, and a few other small groups,” I said. Technically, it was the truth. We, as in me and the girls, were trying to protect our little corner, Silver Spires, from the busybodies that fell under the flag of Eternals and Necromancers. </p><p>“I see,” she said, but this time, her voice smoothed out a bit. “And have you thought about my offer? I can give you power.” </p><p>I decided to accept, and started adding another small detail to my fake soul space. A copy of the Companion Node that I gifted to the girls, but one that was around twenty percent completion. My words, however, differed. “I have, but unfortunately, I need to say no?”</p><p>“What, why?” she gasped, this time, her shock completely genuine. Apparently, she was thinking that after all the effort I had put in, it was a done deal. </p><p>“Don’t get me wrong, I’m willing to fight at the same side with you. Between undead hordes and monster hordes, the enemy is clearly evil,” I said, but then, I paused as I gestured my surroundings. “But I’m not sure just how better are you, soaked in darkness. We both know that the nature of magic usage is not a one-way road. Being soaked in darkness for who knows how long, how could I be sure that you’re any better than the liches that sieging the school. How can I be sure that there’s not another lich under your robes.” </p><p>She said nothing for a moment, thinking my words, while I committed fully on my bluff. I made a show of gathering my mana, purest I could manage, fire elemental mashed with a generous serving of life magic, essentially the bane of undead, not only selling my hatred against undead, but it was also the most similar magic I could cast similar to light magic, at least in terms of the sensation. </p><p>Of course, the whole point of my fake standoff relied on the fact that I had learned about her true identity, something even Titania wasn’t aware of. I was essentially positioning myself as everything that stood against the undead and the fake personality she had created to hide her true identity. I had one objective. </p><p>To force her to reveal her true face to gain my alliance. </p><p>It wasn’t that I wanted to see her beautiful face rather than her cloaked body. While that would have been fun, the knowledge that what lay underneath those robes, while she thought that I knew nothing about the truth of it, had its own warped thrill. </p><p>She had been hiding her face for almost two centuries —at least— from everyone —possibly except a few select people, but even that was not a certainty. I wanted her to reveal her true nature before speaking, because it would break a comfortable layer of subterfuge she had been relying on for centuries, making it much easier to take at least partial control of our discussions. </p><p>“Are you sure you want to make that decision just because of my darkness,” she said, the darkness suddenly intensifying, the aura slamming against me like a rabid monster, enough to scare me if I hadn’t known that she was pushing her limits to handle the darkness just to intimidate me. </p><p>My face stiffened as I flared my purest life energy against her aura, actively burning mana rather than just yielding it.  </p><p>[-315 Mana]</p><p>If she had been an undead like her cover was alluding to, she might have reacted to that as an actual attack. Instead, she stood motionless as I pushed back the darkness to a degree that I started stirring the Divine Spark of Darkness once more. It was angry. </p><p>She must have realized that reaction as well, because the pressure disappeared immediately, and the life energy filled the room, her body as the only exception as her robes created an impenetrable barrier for it. It was easy to assume that her robe was reinforced against pure energies to protect her. Luckily, I knew that it was just to hide her true nature. </p><p>I slowly let my implied attack go, relaxing once more as she stood motionless, no doubt thinking how to handle my sudden hard stance. Just to push her even more out of balance, I once again leaned back and crossed my legs. “Do you have any tea?” I suddenly asked. </p><p>“What?” she gasped in shock, not even using her raspy fake tone properly, but I didn’t act like I noticed that. </p><p>“A cup of tea? At least a glass of water? Offering refreshments is a part of being a good hostess, you know. You might not feel the need to consume anything, but it doesn’t apply to us poor living.” </p><p>“I … see,” she murmured, this time, her voice properly fake-scary. “If I’m understanding correctly, your whole objection comes from my nature as undead.” </p><p>“Well, either that, or a mage seeped in darkness,” I quickly jumped, like I was trying to plug a loophole. “Your status as technically alive wouldn’t change a lot, a living mind clouded with darkness is not too different from the rotten brain of an undead.” </p><p>The silence stretched once more. Then, she stood up as the room filled with the anticipation of power, hovering like a dark shadow as she walked around her desk, standing in front of me, but this time, it was not the suffocating sense of darkness. It wasn’t the pure light I had watched her use either. The most accurate description would be the sensation just before the storm, thick and suffocating, replicating the calm before the storm, like she was giving me one last chance before evaporating me from the face of the earth. </p><p>I had to admit, it was an amazing ploy, one that would have made me retreat under any other circumstances. Instead, I raised my fist, and started gathering life energy, confident that it wouldn’t trigger a panic reaction from her. </p><p>What kind of angel would be scared of pure mana of life, after all. </p><p>She confirmed that decision by stretching our standoff, trying to unbalance me as much as possible before the big reveal. “One last chance,” she said with a nightmare-fuel voice. </p><p>I just smirked, but it wasn’t my flirty smile. No, that smirk conveyed my desire to live, but also my determination to never bow to anyone else. Unlike my previous expressions, it wasn’t a fake one. Since the first taste of power, I strived for my independence, and no amount of fake necromancer tricks could convince me to abandon my freedom. </p><p>Not even a sexy angel could… I was free, now and forever. </p><p>My dark smirk seemed to convince her about my determination, because she reached to her hood, and with a flick, she threw it back. Two beautiful wings burst open behind at the same time, shining with a thick wave of pure energy, similar to Titania’s light magic, yet at the same time, utterly different. </p><p>Her pure magic filled the room, even infusing my magic, but surprisingly, not invading my soul space, not even the fake one. </p><p>“How about now?” she asked, the fake raspy tone abandoned in favor of her beautiful melodic voice, one that would have left me in awe and trigger my desire to worship… </p><p>“Wow,” I murmured like I was dazed, and she stood confident, assuming that her amazing reveal was enough to guarantee my surrender. I smirked at her once more, but it wasn’t the previous one that declared my undying will. No, it was my best flirty smirk, enhanced by the full weight of my charisma. “You’re so cute.” </p><p>I would forever cherish the memory of her expression sliding from perfect confidence into a stammering mess, a sudden blush covering her cheeks. On the range of expressions she had expected, being flirted was clearly not a part of it. “W-what?” she stammered as her beautiful eyes widened, displaying their beautiful yet ethereal silver color, matching her wings. </p><p>Though, with her face blushing like a schoolgirl, she looked significantly less ethereal, even compared to her naked state. </p><p>I stood up, slowly reached and caressed her chin softly, and pulled back while she flinched in shock. “Well, you’re cute,” I repeated, not bothering the amused warmth in my voice. I wasn’t planning to push her that much, but also, I wasn’t expecting my flirting to work that effectively. The best I expected was a momentary flush which I could convert into a small advantage, not a complete collapse like an innocent girl kept away from people by an over-protective family. “I wasn’t expecting to find such a cute angel underneath those robes, color me surprised.” </p><p>“I…” she started, only to fade into silence, too flustered to say anything. </p><p>“You, what?” I said as I stood just a foot away from her, enjoying her moment of shy silence far more than I should have. After days of trying to get a handle on her, breaking her through flirting definitely wasn’t what I had been expecting. I decided to push her even more. “So, why don’t you get rid of that ugly robe and we can continue our discussion,” I said as I took a step back and took a seat. </p><p>“W-what?” she stammered once more, trying to process my words. </p><p>“Well, since you’re an angel, I expect you have more thematically appropriate clothes under that ugly black robe. Just finish your reveal and we can continue our very important discussion,” I said. “Unless you’re going commando and have nothing under that robe,” I added, making sure that it came across as a dismissive joke. </p><p>She said nothing, or more accurately, she couldn’t say anything, too busy trying to replicate a ripening apple as a blush covered her face while her shocking magical display came to a stop suddenly. She took a step back and stumbled over her desk. She didn’t fall, but not because of her legs. She actually flapped her wings gently to prevent herself from falling. She just looked at me, shocked. </p><p>“Okay, I wasn’t expecting you to be going commando, how naughty of you?” I said while she sat on her desk, a dazed expression on her face. “So, since we solved the issue of you being a necromancer, should we continue to discuss the terms of an alliance.” My smirk widened even further. “I vote for a close one…” </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 30    Experience: 447193 / 465000 </p><p>Strength: 41    Charisma: 53</p><p>Precision: 35    Perception: 37</p><p>Agility: 35     Manipulation: 40</p><p>Speed: 34       Intelligence: 44</p><p>Endurance: 34      Wisdom: 46</p><p>HP: 5370  / 5370\tMana: 6600  / 6600        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]    </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100]        </p><p>Master Subterfuge [97/100]     </p><p>Expert Speech [70/75]</p><p>Advanced Craft [50/50]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 21/25]</p><p>[Helga - Level 17/21]</p>",

    "content": "<p>After rushing back to school, I wasn’t surprised to find the courtyard as a confusing mess, the guards and students running around to establish a secondary defensive line to prevent anyone else from escaping, but the lack of surprise didn’t equal a lack of disappointment. </p><p>“It’s supposed to be the strongest bastion of humanity,” I murmured in disappointment as I watched the ineptness of the defensive force as they tried to establish a defensive force. Even the existence of the spies on the higher ranks wasn’t enough to excuse this incompetence. </p><p>A sigh escaped my mouth, considering the relative merits of actually asking the headmistress to take control of the defenses. Making myself a target —even more than I already was— ranked quite low on the list of my priorities, but it was still ranked above losing my only effective power base. </p><p>Not to mention, the headmistress was important for more than one reason. Not only she was currently my only clue about the Divine Spark, she most likely knew much more about what a Divine Spark in the first place. I highly doubted that her true identity as a mystical angel and her possession of a Divine Spark was a coincidence. </p><p> And it would be a lie to say that I wasn’t imagining bending her over against the window of the highest tower, pulling back her wings, and impale her repeatedly as I interrogated her… </p><p>I cut through the crowd, directly to her tower, cutting through the wards she had established around her tower. It was a nice change to casually cut through them rather than fiddling with them for several minutes while trying to stay concealed. I wanted her to know I was coming. </p><p>I found the headmistress in her office, sitting behind her desk, once again concealed with her dark robe, her wings gathered behind her to create an impression of a hunched crone. However, knowing what lay underneath —and the fact she wore nothing under that robe— I felt excited. The room looked pristine at first glance, but both her desk and her shelf were considerably poorer thanks to my restless fingers. </p><p>“What are you doing here?” she asked in a crooked voice, perfected to make her look like she was a woman that was battling the ailments of aging unsuccessfully, but now that I knew what to look for, it was easy to identify the artificial nature of her sound. The fact that she wasn’t focusing on her acting made that even easier. </p><p>She wasn’t paying attention to her act, because her attention was on her magic. As she spoke, a wave of magic slammed against me, dark enough to suffocate me. She trembled as the threatening waves slammed against me, giving the impression that she was barely holding herself back. </p><p>Amazing performance, I noted in my mind. If I hadn’t known the magic she was using wasn’t the opposite to her true nature, making her even less threatening than her usual state, I might have actually felt scared. But considering her light-based magic, she was actually making herself weaker as she tried to intimidate me. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have to cleanse herself from darkness through that ritual. </p><p>Of course, I could have acted like a craven visitor, like I was scared of her display of power, but I decided against it. I had enough leverage to push her buttons without courting death, unless she wanted to reveal her true nature to everyone on the edge of a crisis. “Hello to you as well,” I droned calmly. </p><p>Her shadow magic staggered for a moment as she moved. It wasn’t hard to imagine her cute face frowning under the shadows of her cloak as she tried to understand the implications of my casual response. “Speak,” she ordered a second later, once again leaning on her mysterious headmistress persona. </p><p>“If you want to be a bitch about it,” I whispered to myself, with the full knowledge that she would hear. But before she could even process that calculated disrespect, I pulled the remaining two fake mana gems and passed one to her. “Look what I had found,” I said to her as I passed them. </p><p>She cast darkness magic to cover the gem completely before pulling it telekinetically. “Careful,” I warned her, not because I expected it to hurt her to a significant degree, but I didn’t want to be blamed for an inept assassination attempt. </p><p>She established a shield around the gem to protect herself before filling the said sphere with darkness. I acted nonchalantly as I examined the flood of magic, only to notice the distinct flare of light magic under the concealment of the darkness. She clearly didn’t trust her darkness magic enough to cast detection through it. </p><p>Then, a few seconds later, the gem exploded —rather harmlessly thanks to her shield. I was happy to see the gem explode, because it implied that her magical detection capabilities weren’t too much above mine, at least not when she was multitasking by duel-wielding magic of opposite natures.</p><p> Her posture stiffened as the explosion faded. “What’s this?” she asked. </p><p>“It’s the second wave of the monster hordes I managed to intercept. I managed to intercept two of them in twenty minutes. I’m willing to bet that they are sending them to every single location. You better warn the teams there that the gams they extract from the monsters might be trapped.” </p><p>“All of them?” she asked, for once the crackling artificial nature of her voice disappearing as she pronounced the first word, instead of starting with a smooth, melodic tone, more beautiful than every single piece of music I had the pleasure to listen. “Explain.”  </p><p>“Your Highness,” I said, adding just enough mocking edge to leave no doubt that I was mocking her. I wanted to remind her that I was not a subordinate of hers. “Whoever was behind the attacks, they seem to be determined to weaken your loyal forces further using the opportunity.”</p><p>“Don’t you think that it’s the necromancers?” she said, her tone cracking once more, but despite that, she had made a big mistake as she tried to process the surprise. It was the first time she was asking my opinion rather than giving an order, which made an obvious attempt to distract me from the truth. Unfortunately for her, that deviation strongly suggested that she was aware of the mysterious organization’s presence, and that awareness stretched back quite a while. Otherwise, she would have revealed their presence. </p><p>“Not really. If that power belonged to them, they would have used that before,” I answered before smiling, with a slightly mocking edge to anger her further. Knowing that she wouldn’t dare to reveal her true power gave me an edge in our discussions that I wanted to push to the limit. “However, wouldn’t it better to continue this discussion after you alert the defenders about trapped gems. Unless you have too many soldiers and you want to use the opportunity to get rid of some of them, of course.” </p><p>She took an audible breath, reflecting her frustration in a visceral manner. She clearly didn’t appreciate my mocking an hour after her office was broken in. Despite her cloak, I could see that she had to struggle to keep her temper down. </p><p>“It’s better to avoid jumping to conclusions,” she murmured before she pulled a crystal from the depths of her desk, and used that as a focus to cast a spell, no doubt sending a magical message using one of the contingencies they had set up. </p><p>While she was busy with communication, I pulled a chair and sat across her without her permission, even crossing my legs and leaned back to show my relaxation. Even as she spoke, I could feel the weight of her gaze. I managed to properly anger her. </p><p>As she spoke, I spent my time imagining the flawless body underneath her body —though I also set up a fake soul space to trick her once more just in case she started to feel jealous. The effect of the crystal was still working —through to a reduced degree— which meant the fake space was much more believable. </p><p>[-23 Mana] </p><p>It took five minutes for her to put down the crystal once more. I spoke before she could take the control of the discussion. “So, you were going explain this new organization supporting the necromancers,” I said despite being well-aware that not only she hadn’t slipped up enough to admit her knowledge, but also she was —or at least, should have been— smart enough to know that she hadn’t made a mistake of that extent. I was pushing my luck, which also suggested I had come across them during one of the missions. </p><p>It was a strategic move, both pushing her to give me information, but also simultaneously giving her the opportunity to strengthen the alliance between us. I was hoping that my arrogance would sell the idea that the imaginary organization behind me was strong enough for her to make such a move worthwhile. </p><p>She came to a quick decision. “There is a group called the Knights of the Eternal Vigil, or Eternals for short,” she started, and I put my whole effort to push a fake expression, like I tried to suppress my shocked expression, keeping my face calm except one subtle twitch, trying to sell the idea that I knew about them. If she thought that I was testing her by asking something I already knew, she would give me more information, thinking that she was converting a useless chip into goodwill. </p><p>It was a tricky line to walk. </p><p>“Their root goes back to ancient times, a time before the Cleansing,” she said, and I took a note of the term she had used. Cleansing was no doubt referring to the catastrophic event that changed the world, but there was not a lot of information about the nature of the event. But the term she was using for that was really specific, meaning, she likely knew what happened those days. </p><p>Maybe she was alive those days. After all, I had no idea how long an Angel could live, or whether they even have a natural lifecycle. </p><p>“They had been established by a group of Divine-touched, led by seven demigods, on the city of Akhenaten, to protect people from the excess of the storm god,” she said, giving me another shock. Yes, the presence of an angel in front of me —in addition to the rather suggestive name of Divine Spark— suggested the legends about the old gods might not be as artificial as I had first assumed, but to be confirmed by her with such casualness was a different thing. I tried to process the blow while she gave a breakdown of the names of the demigods and some notable Divine-touched, without actually explaining what a Divine-touched was. </p><p>I couldn’t even guess from their abilities, as none of the events she mentioned meant anything for me. Smart, I thought. She was clearly testing the limits of my knowledge, maybe even slipping some fake information as insurance. So, I decided to act like I hadn’t recognized anything other than major references to the concept, like the nature of the demigods and divine-touched —hiding them behind the appropriate fake expression to make her work for that information, of course. </p><p>“A lofty goal,” I murmured, cutting her history expression short. “I’m going to guess that their nobility didn’t extent forever.” </p><p>“Not particularly, no,” she continued. “Their daring to stand against him enraged the Storm God immensely, and he sent his own forces to destroy the city of Akhenaten. The battle lasted for a century, but much to the surprise of everyone, the battle ended with the Storm Avatar being slain, damaging the very soul of the Storm God.” </p><p>“Impressive,” I murmured, aware that the true fun was just about to start. “What happened after that?” </p><p>“Then, they got arrogant…” the headmistress said with her raspy tone, the darkness around her tightening. This time, the darkness felt less like magic, and more like a natural reaction. Much to my surprise, it didn’t even felt connected to Headmistress, but as a part of the aura of the room, independent of her control. </p><p>[Divine Spark Identified!

    "content": "<p>With both showers occupied, I found myself with nothing to do. Well, there was something to do, I could have joined Carrie at the downstairs bathroom, showering together, but doing so would have ruined the whole point of the evening. Carrie was already too hesitant to act, and I doubted the lethargy of an orgasm would push her to act.</p><p>No, I wanted her on edge, struggling for her reward.  </p><p>Instead, I walked upstairs and knocked on the bathroom door as I passed. “Sarah, do you mind giving a shout after you finish your shower, I’ll be in my room at the end of the corridor,” I said, and after receiving a positive answer, I walked to my room. </p><p>I got rid of my trunks with a kick, into the laundry bin, and wrapped a towel around my waist instead, which left my chest naked. It wasn’t an intentional strategy, I just didn’t want to sit naked while waiting for Sarah to finish her shower. Unexpectedly, it turned out to be useful a few minutes later, where I had been distracting myself by playing with my phone. </p><p>“You have a nice room,” Sarah said, her tone, seductive, playful, and, most importantly, intentionally exaggerated. Not bad, I thought as I swiveled in my chair, looking at her. What I saw left me satisfied. Her beautiful black hair was still damp, adding a different aura to her normally uptight state. </p><p>However, the real clincher was the way she dressed. She wore a tight black top, sleeveless to show off her lithe arms, scooped low enough to show a tasteful amount of cleavage, and snug enough to show off the perfect shape of her small breasts—well, compared to the delicious monstrosities Carrie was sporting, but otherwise perfectly-proportioned. The naked line that was left in her stomach just added to her aura of sexiness. It even gave a small peek of her bra when she leaned forward, revealing that she was wearing black there as well.</p><p>Down below, she wore clingy black shorts, barely enough to cover her ass, but clinging to her body tightly enough to reveal the shape and the exact lace content of her panties. Moreover, they looked soft like satin, begging to be caressed. Overall, she was a delicious bombshell, much better than the usual drab tomboyish stuff she preferred for the school. </p><p>I decided to reward her a bit, and as I stood up, I pushed my towel down slightly. Not much, just enough to give her a full, unobstructed view of my abs without making the moment pornographic. The sudden blush on her face as she stammered, swallowing her next words was simply spectacular. </p><p>“I’ll be downstairs in a few minutes,” I said as I walked toward her, amused by the way her eyes dipping lower, widening in shock. Clearly, without Carrie for her to focus on, my naked torso was much more effective to distract her. </p><p>I decided to tease her a bit more. She was late to pull back from the doorway, so I let my body brush against her as I passed, which worked perfectly to dislodge my towel, letting it fall on the floor. “Sorry!” she exclaimed in shock as she slammed her hands on her face, taking a step back, the calmness she tried to reflect evaporated completely.  </p><p>However, I noticed that she was still peering from a crack between her fingers as I refastened the towel around my waist. It took effort not to chuckle as her revealing clothing revealed a full-body blush. Despite her attempts to make her the wordy member of their little club of nerds, she was just as innocent as Carrie. </p><p>I wondered she would be equally unbounded once she got a taste of the joys of physical affairs. </p><p>An upbeat whistle escaped my lips as I stepped into the bathroom, but with a sudden streak of mischievousness, I decided to leave the door cracked enough to be noticeable by an attentive wanderer. Then, the hot water flew over my body, getting rid of the pool water and the shower gel, leaving only cleanliness behind. </p><p>A glance at the mirror, however, revealed that I had an audience, a brunette one. Doing my best not to chuckle, I started washing the lower half of my body, but with a generous amount of bubbles between my legs to hide my half-erect shaft. It was still a preview, after all. </p><p>Unfortunately, I couldn’t just turn and watch her. Instead, I tried to get a sense of what she was doing from accidental glances of peripheral vision. When I noticed a sharp movement, I thought that she had left, but a lingering one revealed that she had been still in her position, her shoulders moving suspiciously. </p><p>Pity that she was looking through a crack, which hid the rest of her body from my view. I was planning how to tease her more, when a door opened downstairs, and Sarah jerked back, her flickering —and perverted— confidence destroyed by Carrie walking around freely around the house. </p><p>A set of footsteps got away rapidly. I sighed as I quickly finished my shower and changed into a pair of shorts and a tight muscle shirt. Before I could go downstairs, I heard a heated discussion between the girls, which, unfortunately, was not loud enough to be deciphered from upstairs. </p><p>Whatever the reason for their short tussle, I found them sitting on the couch, watching TV with a stiffness that shouted they were deliberately not looking at each other. I coughed lightly, and Carrie jumped up to her feet. “Chad,” she said with her sweet voice, giving me the opportunity to assess her outfit. </p><p>I hadn’t been expecting her to wear something sexier than her swimsuit which she chose for the pool, but somehow, she managed to surprise me. Technically, it was a simple, airy sundress, covered with simple white and blue patterns. On most women, it would be a nice and innocent dress that enhanced their conservative side. But for a woman with the curves Carrie had, it was nothing less than an erotic smoke show. Her arms were left bare, and while the top of her dress was tight enough that it was clearly trying to contain her massive busts, it was failing, and failing because of a lack of reinforcement. </p><p>She wasn’t wearing a bra. </p><p>Just that fact —along with her god-given curves, of course— was enough to turn her conservative dress into an erotic masterpiece. The top of her dress wrapped around her globes, taking its shape enough to create an excellent sketch of her breasts. Her nipples, exerting their presence proudly, didn’t hurt the aura of the moment any. And that was before coming to her cleavage, which was clearly designed to be a modest one for anyone else, but with her tits stretching the fabric, turned into a delicious show. </p><p>And to top it off, it was a thin dress, not thin enough to be transparent, but thin enough to reveal every single detail of her body whenever she moved, from her perfect tits to her plump ass. </p><p>“You look nice,” I said, enjoying the blush that spread her face. From her reaction, I could see that it was not a planned show. She clearly brought the dress to impress, but I had no doubt that until several minutes ago, she had been planning to wear the dress with a bra, which would have reduced the sexiness potential of it several notches. </p><p>I was rather happy with the last-minute change. However, it didn’t take a genius to realize Sarah wasn’t as approving. Part of it was no doubt about her unhappiness about being upstaged —and since she had already shown her outfit to me, changing was not an option unless she wanted to be too direct— but I was prideful enough to hope that my two little back-to-back shows had left her frustrated enough to trigger her anger more. </p><p>“So, what game are we playing, girls,” I said even as grabbed the remote and switched to a music channel that seemed innocent. There was another little trap hidden there, waiting for its time to go off. </p><p>“Do you have any board games,” Sarah asked, which, honestly, surprised me. </p><p>“Sure, the first drawer under the TV,” I said, which contained several board games, purchased as a part of the family decor rather than actually using them. “Nice choice,” I said when she raised a simple tower-building game, trying to hide my disappointment, but with limited impact. </p><p>“It’s an excellent game, rewarding eye-hand coordination,” Sarah said smugly while Carrie stiffened. </p><p>“If that’s what you wish,” I said, trying not to sound flat, but failing. When she mentioned party games, I had been expecting something more interesting than this. </p><p>Then, after sharing a victorious smirk with Carrie, she turned to me, with a victorious expression on her face. “You don’t seem to be too happy about that,” she said. “And I didn’t even finish explaining.” </p><p>“Oh, go ahead,” I said, giving her a dark yet heated glare that worked perfectly in the rapid seduction of the cheerleaders. If their matching blushes were any indicator, it worked equally well on nerdy ones. </p><p>“Well, I was thinking of removing a piece of clothing as a punishment, and that stays removed until the end of the night,” she said, then, once again looked at Carrie. “As long as everyone can handle such a simple forfeit, of course.” </p><p>“Of course I can, let’s play,” Carrie answered rapidly, with a wave of anger that surprised me. Whatever discussion I had missed that managed to galvanize Carrie more than I had expected. </p><p>“Sure, but with a small addendum,” I said. “Everyone has the right to remove the last piece under the blanket,” I said, pointing at the large fluffy one that lay on the large couch, but doing so would mean leaving the game. The first one to lose will have an additional punishment by the winner. </p><p>“Sounds good,” Carrie agreed quickly, feeling challenged by the forfeit despite her anger, unaware of the naughty implications of the supposedly protective scheme I had offered. Sarah, on the other hand, sent me a frustrated look before sat on the floor with no preamble, setting up the blocks with a smoothness that surprised me greatly. She had skilled fingers. </p><p>I sat down next to her, curious about the extent of the skillfulness of her fingers… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Honestly, looking at the beautiful, honest expression on Aria’s face, declaring her growing affection with a directness that surprised me considering her shyness, coming to an answer was easy. </p><p>Suspiciously easy. </p><p>However, rather than giving an answer immediately, I chose to push her conviction a bit. “Are you sure you want to act on that feeling?” I asked even as I let my hands to her waist, tightening harder than what she might find erotic. Still, she didn’t try to pull back. “Because I’m a possessive man, to a level you can’t imagine. If you give yourself to me, I will let nothing else get between us, even if I return back to dark lands.” </p><p>“What? Really?” she gasped, but the revulsion I expected her to feel at the threat of being kidnapped to the land of evil didn’t appear. </p><p>“Sweetheart, after everything I have done, do you think the threat of the Empire would even make me blink if I wanted to steal you,” I said casually, enjoying the way she melted against my body as I did so. “No, if you’re mine, then you’re mine. Nothing other than your own decision could separate us.” </p><p>I watched as her expression flickered indecisively before steeling into a determination I had never seen in her face, her softness peeling back to reveal an iron will. It was new and brittle, her eyes trembling despite that, but it was a new beginning for her. I could see that for once in her life, she had come to a radical decision of her own rather than others guide her. “I understand,” she said, but her words didn’t answer my question. </p><p>She decided to that in a more direct manner. </p><p>A smile appeared on her face, one that managed to quicken my heartbeat despite its smallness. I wasn’t able to enjoy that smile for a long smile because she leaned forward, initiating the most heated kiss I had ever received from her by a huge margin. I could feel her growing affection in the way her lips danced over mine.  </p><p>When she pulled back, she was gasping in exhaustion. I decided to give my answer in an uncharacteristic manner as well. I took her hands in mine and kissed her palms gently, while she shivered next to me. Her smile widened, brighter than the midday sun, enough to warm even my cynical heart. </p><p>“Are you satisfied with your answer,” I said. </p><p>She nodded. She caught my eyes, the reeling of her emotions impossible to hide. She had not said a word as she enjoyed the sensation, but I decided to change things up a bit. I suddenly lifted her in a gentle bridal hold, and she let out a shocked cry that managed to harden me completely once again. </p><p>“Where are we going?” she murmured, uncaring between and carried her to her bathroom, enjoying the tender closeness. </p><p>“I think we deserve a nice, tender bath after everything that happened, don’t you think?” I asked. She buried herself into my chest, which was sufficient as an answer. </p><p>The bathroom was another example of decadence, a huge elegant marble pool that was enough to allow several people to enjoy a long soak, with walls decorated with tasteful gold embroiders. And, conveniently, the bathroom was equipped with a number of magical items that made things much easier. It took only seconds to create a steaming bath which we could enjoy together. </p><p>I sank into the water, enjoying the warmth. Aria, on the other hand, seemed to have other priorities than enjoying a nice soak, and lunged forward the moment we sank into the bath, kissing me. It was desperate, impatient, and overwhelmed, as if she just realized the momentousness of what she had agreed. It was like fire, burning my lips. </p><p>While the warm soak was nice, it was impossible to match the heat of Aria’s kiss. So, I let myself get tangled with her glistening body as she rocked her hips against mine underwater, providing a completely different sensation against my erection. </p><p>We savored the moment in each other's arms as the warmth invaded our bodies, not that we needed the assistance. Our situation was the furthest thing from cold in the first place. </p><p>When she pulled back, I decided to enjoy her recently-cleaned skin. My mouth traced its way down her neck, to her shoulder, gently brushing the earlier hickeys our tangle —which I might even call lovemaking— had left as a vivid reminder. </p><p>With a deep, happy smile, Aria threw her head back, giving me an excellent sight into her cleavage, partly buried under the water, obscured by the bubbles. The tops danced with her every move, tempting my mouth. I was never one to resist such temptation. My head dropped until my face was buried in the slippery expanse of her cleavage. </p><p>This time, she didn’t stay passive as I kissed my way down the expanse of her bosom, using my teeth to leave more marks on her huge, gorgeous tits, declaring our growing relationship in my own twisted way. </p><p>As my tongue found her deliciously erect nipples, she managed to align her hips against my shaft, pushing herself down until her entrance swallowed it completely. She threw back her head with a moan and impatiently squeezed her legs, making it a much more delicious moment. </p><p>A grunt of approval escaped my mouth, but I didn’t take my mouth from her breasts even as she jumped up and down across my length. Things were getting heated… </p><p>Then, we hit a snag, in the form of a door suddenly opening, likely the main entrance of her section. From the way Aria’s face contorted in shock, I already knew who was responsible for opening the door, but I still asked. “Is there a chance that it might be a maid, or a friend?” She shook her head desperately. “Any chance that it’s someone else than the queen?” I followed, and she shook her head again. </p><p>“No, she’s the only one that can open my door without my express permission,” she said. </p><p>She tried to stand up, but I grabbed her and prevented her from standing up. I didn’t panic, because ultimately, I was confident enough on my hold on Sapphire to push the situation further. Worst came to worst, I could reveal few more hands earlier than I planned. “Calm down,” I said even as cast a simple fire spell, filling the room with enough steam to block sight, enough to rob Sapphire from the ability to assess Aria’s face. </p><p>“Try to talk to her normally,” I said as I let the water swallow me, only my nose visible, and even that requires a careful search among the piles of bubbles on the water. Surprisingly, my direct order went a long way to sap her nervousness. My arms tightened around Aria’s waist, preventing her from pulling out as Sapphire burst in. </p><p>However, it wasn’t just the excitement of the situation I was forcing Aria to talk to the Queen. From the way things were developing, it was inevitable for Aria to challenge Sapphire in one way or another, and the sooner we started, the sooner I could trust her where that mattered. </p><p>Of course, if I had to admit, taking the crown princess while the queen was unaware of it was a delicious moment that I might have tried regardless, but the reasoning made it easier. </p><p>“Good morning, mother,” she stammered —after all, there was a limit to the benefits of my assistance. It was impossible for her to develop an iron will against the authority figure in an instant. But even without any practice, she was doing better than I was hoping for. She hadn’t fainted yet, at least, which was much more than she could have achieved under such circumstances when our little game had started. </p><p>“I see you’re being lazy again,” Sapphire answered sharply, once again displaying her thorny personality. No wonder Aria’s sense of self was so shaky that it took a dark lord to fix it. </p><p>“Sorry, mother,” Aria said. Without me, she would have jumped off, but my presence prevented her from doing so. “I didn’t have anything to do early morning, so I decided to lie in a bit.” </p><p>“I see, and why are you not with that useless mage, helping with the interrogation,” Sapphire continued, showing that her acrimony wasn’t just targeted to her daughter, but against everyone. </p><p>Such a warm personality, I thought in amusement even as I pushed deeper into Aria’s entrance, enjoying the way she tightened around. It was clear that enjoyment was a part of the flood of emotions she was feeling, despite the daringness of the situation. </p><p>“You should be more careful around her, she’s always trying to pull something else to get some advantage,” Sapphire continued as Aria shuffled in place as if she was trying to sit more comfortably, but actually pushed my shaft even deeper. The way she trembled in excitement multiplied my enjoyment significantly. </p><p>“Emma is not like that,” Aria countered reflexively, which was a completely inaccurate sentence, considering she was willing to risk everything including freeing me from my bonds and use dangerous magic that she had no idea about how to use, not to mention her underground deal with the councilwoman I had watched. </p><p>Sapphire clearly had a better understanding of Emma’s opportunistic personality, while Aria’s own optimistic view prevented her from seeing the truth. Though, considering the circumstances, I was the last person to complain about her trusting nature, considering that I owed her the ease I acquired my freedom. </p><p>“Nonsense, she’s already able to convince him to share some secrets, and I don’t want her to be the one to win this,” Sapphire said, but her voice lacked the drive I expected her to have. Apparently, her mysterious ‘informer’ had managed to completely convince her about the quality of his information. </p><p>The backlash of tantric magic was so beautiful. </p><p>Sapphire took a step closer, giving me the opportunity to get a hidden glimpse of her with the slight assistance from my magic to keep me concealed. She was wearing a thick dressing gown which she loosened under the heat of the room. Under that, she wore a thin silk negligee that couldn’t be made any thinner. Combined with the steam in the room, it turned almost invisible, to a point that the steam was providing several times more coverage. </p><p>“I don’t know, mother. It’s not like I have the skills to interrogate him,” Aria said, which was a complete lie at this point. I was more than happy to tell a lot of stuff, but she didn’t even bother to ask. From the way she trembled as I impaled her repeatedly, it was clear where her priorities lay. </p><p>“Silly girl,” Sapphire said with a sigh. “You have already healed her, and after such extended isolation, he should be having some positive feelings toward you. Go and use that closeness, maybe even drop a few fake cries, and tell that your status depends on it. In the end, he’s nothing but a man, and a man could never reject the opportunity to impress a beautiful innocent girl.” Sapphire sighed. “And don’t forget to wear something more revealing than your usual drab stuff,” Sapphire added. Honestly, I wasn’t surprised that Sapphire thought it was a good idea to direct her daughter to flirt with the dark lord, not when she was still willing to trade her body for critical information. </p><p>At least, on this topic, she wasn’t being hypocritical. </p><p>That left me one question, how should I progress to the next step… </p>",

    "content": "<p>When Mark took his usual spot in the library —a nice spot concealed between two hulking bookshelves that kept him the low-key boring craziness of the school— the events of the day before were barely in his mind. After all, he had barely spent ten minutes with Laura while making sure that she gathered herself to avoid a horrible accident. In a life crowded with the presence of the fairer sex, that was not even a blink. </p><p>So, when he heard a shy, trembling greeting, he was quite surprised. “H-hi,” stammered a cute voice. </p><p>He turned to see Laura standing in front of him, her baby-blue eyes brimming with enthusiasm despite her shy tone, two cups of coffee in her hands. And while he was rather uncaring, he wasn’t actively mean enough to push away a young woman who was going through a vulnerable period. “Hello,” he said simply, but made sure to wear a more open posture. </p><p>“I brought you a coffee,” she stammered. “Would you prefer black, or latte with sugar?” </p><p>“Definitely black,” he answered, as the last thing he wanted was the empty calories from sugar. Those empty calories were entirely dedicated to his scotch cabinet. But also, he had a feeling that Laura actually preferred latte, and didn’t want to force her to drink something she didn’t enjoy. </p><p>“Sure,” she said and passed the coffee, but then, rather than turning back, she stalled with a hesitant expression. If it were his younger days, he would have assumed it was about his spectacular handsomeness, but a decade as a —fake— lawyer taught him to read people perfectly. And her hesitant glance toward the library suggested that she didn’t want to walk back to the library to suffer under the enthusiastic gossip of the others. </p><p>It took a great effort on his part to suppress an exhausted sigh. “Would you like to take a seat?” </p><p>“Really?” she asked, surprised. “Wouldn’t it be disturbing to…” she said, her voice disappearing in shame as she glanced toward the main section of the library, clearly worried that gossip might affect him. </p><p>“Maybe it would have been if I had cared about what the pack of rejects think about me,” Mark said cuttingly. </p><p>“That’s not nice,” Laura said sharply, reflexively, which actually put a smile on his face. Then, she blushed sharply. “Sorry-” she started. </p><p>“No need to worry, just take a seat,” Mark ordered, but smoothed out with a smile —a tone which he used successfully against many overenthusiastic, overachieving interns successfully. It was like calming an energetic racehorse, the tone and the confidence were everything. </p><p>Just like he expected, it worked perfectly. Laura took a seat and put her stuffed bag on the desk. She stayed silent for a moment before whispering. “Thanks for yesterday,” she murmured, her eyes on the floor as she took a sip from her coffee.  </p><p>“Not a problem, saving such a cute girl is always its own reward,” Mark said, reflexively using flirting as a tool to dispel the awkwardness. </p><p>“Thanks,” she murmured with a blushing red face, Mark realized the mistake he had committed. He didn’t want to deal with the hero-worship of a girl barely outside the cusp of her teenage years, even if she was in legal age, which could easily transform into an enthusiastic crush.  </p><p>He decided to nip it in the bud. “Can I ask you a question about the Biology homework?” Mark asked in an effort to change the topic. Maybe, if he acts like an idiot unable to learn a few simple formulas, it would blunt her sense of awe, or at least, feel like she helped him back to pay for his emotional support. </p><p>“Of course, let me take a look,” she jumped in enthusiastically as she pulled a notebook filled with many colored note papers and perfect calligraphy, and they started studying… </p><p>*****     *****     *****     *****     *****     </p><p>When Mark decided to act like he was in desperate need of leeching off Laura’s academic credentials in order to lessen her hero-worship, he wasn’t counting on acquiring a permanent study partner who insisted on hanging with him every single opportunity. If it was another person, he would have dismissed them immediately, but somehow, Laura managed to worm herself into his heart. </p><p>As he got to know her better, he understood the reason for his gradual acceptance. Laura was a surprisingly refreshing bundle of childish mannerism and dark jadedness, somehow managing to maintain her optimism. Considering what she had survived her father leaving, her mother kicking her out, rehab, and becoming a social pariah not only in her high school but also in college, Mark couldn’t help but admire her. Kicking addiction under such adverse conditions with no support was nothing short of amazing. He had many clients who failed to resist the temptation despite their huge support network —and consequently screwing hard enough to need his services, which came with a four-figure hourly rate. </p><p>He only survived his problems by delving deeper into jaded selfishness. </p><p>But that fondness came with its own problems, such as a certain sense of responsibility when he saw his new acquaintance talking with a shirtless hippy. Her face bright with excitement while the annoying hippy flirted with her with the comfortable ease of a womanizer, something Mark easily recognized as a fellow womanizer. </p><p>Normally, Mark would have let it play out, glad that Laura’s attention finally finding other targets. The problem was, however, he recognized the hippy after a debacle earlier the year, where he had actually written a song that humiliated the sexy activist blonde in his class, which made her life hell for a long while. </p><p>That man was one of the cruelest men Mark had ever seen, but people ignored that because he hid it behind the flowery speeches about earth mother and eternal soul friendships. </p><p>Which meant that Mark had a very difficult conversation to explain. </p><p>So, at the end of another study session, Mark decided to breach the subject. “Laura, can I talk to you about something serious?” he said calmly, once again using the tone he used to talk to witnesses whenever he wanted to prep them for a difficult conversation. </p><p>“Yes, Mark,” Laura said, but her expression stiffened. She was smart enough to realize that whatever that was going to come next, wasn’t going to be pleasant. </p><p>Mark took a deep breath, and forced himself to relax. He felt tense as he prepared himself to do something he hated, he was about to intervene in someone else’s private affairs.  “I’m going to give you my opinions on something that I’m not supposed to, and it’s going to make you very angry. I want you to think about my words rather than react in anger, okay?” he said, trying to keep the discussion grounded in rationality, despite knowing its futility. No girl in her age handled being told to stay away from a guy they fancied, and the fact that she still had an obvious crush on Mark didn’t make things any less complicated. </p><p>“Go on,” she murmured. </p><p>Mark decided to pull the band-aid in one swift move. “Dating that shirtless homeless guy is not a good idea,” he told her. </p><p>“Why Mark!” Laura answered immediately, anger immediately on her face. “Can’t I date someone unless you approve it? You’re unbelievable,” she started, followed by several choice insults. Mark let her rant angrily, but never let his expression shift or said anything, not feeding her anger. Soon, without the flames of an argument, she was silenced. “Why?” she whispered, exhausted after failing to find a response to her angry statement. </p><p>“Because he’s a cruel man,” Mark said immediately. </p><p>“What!” Laura countered in shock. “That’s nonsense, he’s the kindest, most love-filled man I had ever talked to. And you don’t even know him.” </p><p>Mark could have given a dozen examples just from his mannerism, barely hidden by the hippy exterior, but he said nothing, just pulled his phone, and pressed play, replaying that horrible song. “That - that doesn’t - count,” she stammered. “She must have done something,” she stammered, trying to defend her crush. </p><p>“Maybe,” Mark answered, not wanting to delve into a blame discussion. He was far too familiar with that pattern from all the divorce cases he had handled to know that in the end, it would only make her stick to her opinion even stronger. “But he still chose to turn it into a merciless public spectacle.” </p><p>Seeing her determination stiffen, Mark realized even that wasn’t going to cut it, and in that mood, giving more evidence would make her dig deeper, so he chose to apply another strategy. “I want you to do me a favor. While chatting, ask about the song, but don’t do it like you want an explanation, or that you blame him for it. Just ask him offhandedly, and listen to his response with an open mind.” That hardly helped her expression. </p><p>“Just ask him,” he added, and she nodded with a stony expression before hurriedly gathering her stuff, about to dash away. “And don’t forget, regardless of your decision, I’ll be here. Feel free to drop by whenever you feel overwhelmed.” </p><p>He watched as she disappeared with a sigh, knowing that, whatever she chose, there was going to be a lot of pain in his </p><p>*****     *****     *****     *****     *****     </p><p>Laura was once again feeling like a stupid little girl that thought extra pills would help her handle college application stress as she walked away from her ex-boyfriend, doing her best to keep her tears in. The last thing she needed was to have another public breakdown to start another round of gossip, which would ruin the last scraps of her reputation. </p><p>She had been so confident when she walked to find him, still angry at Mark, enthusiastic to prove that his jaded ways were wrong, that her boyfriend was a nice man. She wanted it to be true so much. But when she mentioned the song, and truly listened to his response, she could hear the childish grudge in his tone as he mentioned just how many hits the song gathered, and gleefully speculated on how humiliating it must have been for his ex, and how it was payback for his bleeding heart. Of course, it wasn’t the words he had used, using his flowery, free-loving phrases to conceal the fact, but Laura was smart enough to read the subtext. </p><p>But in the depths of her heart, she knew that she would never listen to that carefully if it wasn’t for Mark’s warning. </p><p>She shook her head in disbelief. No doubt he treated her like a child, she really was one, falling in pieces just because a cute guy flirted with him, ignoring enough red flags to cover the whole school. She was already in the library as the first tear slid down her cheek. Luckily, it was too early for the library to be crowded, so it wasn’t hard to hide behind the shelves. </p><p>She wanted nothing more than going back to her apartment to cry, but she found herself unable to. Mark had asked her to come back if she was feeling overwhelmed, and she was definitely feeling overwhelmed. She found him still at the same desk, concealed from the others. He raised his head, their eyes connected, and when he opened his arms invitingly Laura felt herself losing the last semblance of control. </p><p>She dashed forward, her arms wrapped tight around his torso as she pulled tight, crying a river. Minutes passed, but Mark did nothing, just hugging her in a lazy manner that filled her heart with security. “Why?” she murmured. “Why do I keep falling for that kind of lie, baring my heart only to be stabbed again and again?” </p><p>“It’s all learning experience,” he murmured, the way his chest trembled helping her to calm down further. “You have gone through much more difficult situations and got away stronger. This is just a bump on the road.” </p><p>Laura hated the feeling of calmness that spread in her body. She was attracted to Mark, and wanted to prove herself as an adult, but how could she when he calmed her with just a touch and a pat on the shoulder. She was no different than a child throwing tantrums. “Maybe it is, but I’m feeling so vulnerable,” she murmured. “Like I joined the game late, and everyone but me knows the rules, waiting to take advantage of me. I trusted my high school boyfriend, and he turned out to be gay. My high school crush managed to ruin my college life without even thinking after everything I had to do to recover my life. And lastly… Well, the less it said, the better.” </p><p>Mark said nothing, just tightened his arms around her. His stupid, muscular arms clamped around her like the world’s sexiest prison, forcing her deeper against his steely chest… And suddenly, Laura’s most dominant emotion wasn’t sadness, but insidious arousal. Then, suddenly, she lost control over her lips, and a sentence escaped. “Can you teach me?”</p><p>“Teach you what?” Mark asked, but from the sudden tenseness in his tone, he clearly understood what she was asking for. </p><p>She pulled out of the hug, and faced him with a serious expression. “Teach me the physical side of things, so I won’t fall the next predator enthusiastically,” she said, even as panic filled her insides, wondering she had made a huge mistake in her hurry… </p>",

    "content": "<p>After the frustrating discovery that not only the Princess’s party was larger and stronger than I expected, but also their willingness to get involved in the chaos that surrounded the school in such a direct manner was much sharped than I expected, I wanted to nothing but a curse. </p><p>I was trying to deal with too many agents of carnage with only a few allies, and things were already difficult to handle before adding another layer of chaos to the game, especially since that supposed addition potentially brought a huge mess of possible Royal involvement. </p><p>It wouldn’t have been that horrifying if the crown princess wasn’t on the edge of being deposed —which meant I could actually try to ally with her without fear— or she had just come with a few bodyguards to get Oeyne to forge her a weapon and leave —instead of a group that was large enough to classify as a small army, with an unknown number of spies and enemy agents. </p><p>An annoying realization started to pickle my mind, that I probably should have pushed for a closer relationship with the headmistress, using Titania as the connection. At least, that way, I could generate a better understanding of her true objectives. The reveal that she possessed the same resource that was preventing me from getting stronger made that annoyance even stronger. </p><p>Admittedly, seeing what lay under her robes went a long way to make me revisit my initial decision to keep her at arm's length. </p><p>What could I say? I was just a poor man with a slightly overactive libido. </p><p>Luckily, I wasn’t too late. The items I had ‘borrowed’ from her room would no doubt help me to get a better understanding of her mind. More importantly, I had the perfect gift to give her. </p><p>[-619 Mana]</p><p>I pumped some mana to my elemental steed to push myself higher in the air, using an illusion to hide me from the view. I stopped climbing only when I was almost two miles high, giving me a perfect view of the plains that surrounded the school, while being too high to notice the individual monsters even if they weren’t trying to escape. </p><p>Luckily, the monster hordes were much easier to detect. Just follow the piles of dust that were struggling to reach the sky. Despite slow encroachment of the night, the plains were still bright enough not to miss such an impressive spectacle —and a pair of sharp eyes, enough to challenge an eagle, helped. </p><p>Hitting the first horde was almost trivial, but before I delved into them, I hit a trio of robed figures observing the horde, one of them radiating the same chaotic magic that I had felt many times before about the mana gems. </p><p>“I’m going to be rich,” I murmured even as I jumped off my mount, diving directly down, not wanting them to notice the mana fluctuations of my mount. I didn’t want to waste my time, and more importantly, I didn’t want them warning others magically. </p><p>And admittedly, with my connection with the element of air was enhanced, falling down the sky with nothing to cut the sensation down, nothing but a sword in my hand, was quite fun. I closed my eye for a moment, enjoying the sensation as the distance between me and the ground —and more importantly, the distance between the people that were directing the horde and my sword— was getting smaller and smaller. Only when there were twenty feet between me and the ground I used magic to cushion my fall. </p><p>Draining all that momentum turned out to be an unpleasant sensation. </p><p>[-81 HP]</p><p>[-64 Mana]</p><p>“Fuck, I should have started earlier I murmured even as my feet slammed on the floor, while an expression of shock appeared on the face of the trio. Being ambushed was unpleasant, but being ambushed by someone dropping from the sky was doubtlessly worse. Unfortunately, I couldn’t have asked for a first-hand account, because a slash of my sword, followed by a rain of arcana bolts was enough to evaporate them. </p><p>“Weak,” I murmured in disappointment as I pulled my sword. They were barely level ten, maybe even lower, not that I bothered to check their soul spaces carefully. Instead, I quickly went through their possessions to find something unusual, either as a clue or for my own usage —but my findings turned out to be disappointing. </p><p>The horde itself wasn’t too challenging as well. A few surges of mana turning into fire and earth was enough to cut through the initial mass of the monster to leave the leading monster alone, and another surge was enough to remove the gem from it. </p><p>[-593 Mana]</p><p>The horde was weak. Suspiciously so, enough that Cornelia could have handled that alone —though not without exhausting herself to the limit, and certainly not strong enough to breach into a fortified settlement— which made me assume some interesting conjectures about their sudden change of plan. </p><p>Maybe, the organization that was supporting the undead horde with the magical items decided to achieve their aims without causing so much civilian death. Technically, it made sense, but after everything, I doubted that they were being held back by that. </p><p>Then, I noticed another horde spilling out of a nearby canyon, so I decided to handle that as well before continuing with my assessment. As I got closer, however, I noticed three shadows slipping back to the canyon, no doubt noticed the destruction of the other horde. </p><p>Wide-area fire spells weren’t exactly inconspicuous, especially in the red dimness of the dusk. </p><p>Fortunately, while my martial expertise was limited to melee, I was more than happy to use magic to handle them, I extended my mana, and three jagged rocks jumped out of the ground, skewering them. </p><p>[-310 Mana]</p><p>Admittedly, it was a wasteful manner of casting, wasting a nice chunk of mana to kill three people on the range. I needed to develop better-ranged spells that couldn’t be countered easily. A trip to their side netted me another mana gem, then, I started working on the horde. </p><p>[-483 Mana]</p><p>It turned out to be even weaker than the previous horde, allowing me to cut through them with great ease. Their weakness despite being so close to the towns revealed that it was not just an accident, but a real strategy. The question was, why? </p><p>A weird fluctuation from the gems pulled my attention. I turned my gaze at them, and sunk my mana, trying to examine their structure, only for a sudden mana surge to grow. “Fuck,” I murmured as I threw it away, while I ordered my mount to move back as quick as possible. I had no idea why the gem was exploding, but the explosion of a mana gem should be extreme. </p><p>Then, it exploded, only to disappoint me. It was not nearly potent as I expected from a mana gem to be. Suspicious, I examined another one, but more carefully, hoping not to trigger the explosion. It eventually did explode, but not before I realized the source of their fragile nature. </p><p>They were fake.</p><p>Even better, it was impossible to use any of the usual detection magics and wards to actually discover their explosive nature, because, technically, they weren’t explosives. They neither used fire to burn their surroundings, nor they used arcana to twist their surroundings in a way that was deadly to any living —or undead— being. They were simply artificial mana storages, which discharged after their outer layer was breached. </p><p>It was not an efficient explosive in terms of mana spent, not even slightly close, but that didn’t matter much when their primary usage was to create monster hordes. </p><p>“Motherfucker,” I murmured as I changed my route back to the school. The plan was dangerous in its simplicity, because if they sent those weak hordes to the towns who had just successfully conclude their defense mission, only to discover a mana gem in the leading monster precious enough to make the defenders fight for it. </p><p>An explosion at that point would be the perfect device to remove a high-level combatant from the battle. </p><p>My lethargy had disappeared as I changed my direction toward the school once more, to have a proper meeting with the headmistress. She was the only one that could send the news about the plan to every defender simultaneously. </p><p>And maybe a chance to breach the topic of ‘helping’ the headmistress handle the weight of the divine spark… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 30    Experience: 447193 / 465000 </p><p>Strength: 41    Charisma: 53</p><p>Precision: 35    Perception: 37</p><p>Agility: 35     Manipulation: 40</p><p>Speed: 34       Intelligence: 44</p><p>Endurance: 34      Wisdom: 46</p><p>HP: 5370  / 5370\tMana: 5491  / 6600        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]    </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100]        </p><p>Master Subterfuge [97/100]     </p><p>Expert Speech [70/75]</p><p>Advanced Craft [50/50]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 21/25]</p><p>[Helga - Level 17/21]</p>",

    "content": "<p>As I watched the enticing angelic figure of the headmistress wresting with an ever-growing pure aura of light as if she was trying to prevent herself from burning up. As the light aura grew stronger and stronger, I was able to detect the pull of an unfamiliar radiance that I actually sensed through my soul. It didn’t take a genius to realize it was the call of the Divine Spark, something I was finally able to detect without the assistance of the system as the intensity of the power increased. </p><p>A potential power source was here, and the headmistress was clearly at her weakest, giving me the perfect opportunity to make a move. </p><p>Unfortunately, I was quick to abandon that tactic, even as a possibility, because as I absorbed a sliver of aura, it burned inside my soul space ceaselessly like it met with an enemy, forcing me to push it out, creating a mana flare as a result. Luckily, her out-of-control aura was enough to drown the small flare of mana that exploded. </p><p>The effect of the divine spark, even a sliver of it, was much more violent than I had expected, enough for me to abandon any hasty attempt trying to absorb that. I needed to get a better understanding of the nature of the Divine Spark as well as how to contain that. </p><p>However, that was a task for a later time. The brightness around the headmistress got stronger and stronger, to a point that I could barely see a silhouette of her. </p><p>It was the best opportunity to leave the room, and since she was clearly had other priorities, it also meant a small opportunity to visit her office. With the additional control given by the weird crystal —even though its effects already started to fade noticeably— I was able to break through the defenses of the office quickly. One interesting thing was that the moment I stepped out of the confines of her room, I lost my ability to detect the aura of light she was spreading despite the intensity. </p><p>The magical isolation in her room was impressive if it could keep that explosive aura completely contained. With that isolated, it was going to be an easy job… </p><p>… at least, that was what I had been hoping for, but the fates decided to give a different gift to me. The moment I cracked open the door, I came face to face with another hooded figure with absolutely no visible location. Her clothes and the cloak covered her body perfectly, not revealing even a hair. Despite that, however, it was very clear that she was a female. </p><p>A skin-tight leather suit was not particularly efficient in terms of hiding the delicious curves of the body. </p><p>The more important detail was her reaction. Even if the way she dressed hadn’t been enough to reveal that she didn’t have any more right to actually be in this place rather, her panic at seeing me revealed that she didn’t have any more right to be here than I did.  </p><p>Unfortunately, she moved even quicker than I could react —at least, not without summoning enough mana to risk being caught in the first place. So, I watched as the thief threw herself back, breaking through the window, triggering every single ward in the office in her hurry. </p><p>“Fuck my luck,” I murmured as I used the stairs to dash out before the headmistress could react. I had no idea how long it would take to suppress the Divine Spark and join the chase, but I certainly didn’t want to get caught. Still, I didn’t want to get away empty-handed, so before leaving, I arrived at the bookshelf, used my cloak as a bag to shove everything on the desk before treating the books on the shelf the same. </p><p>Then, I dashed away, undecided about whether I should be happy or sad about the sudden intrusion. While the surprise thievery prevented me from examining the office carefully, it also gave me a convenient scapegoat to steal everything from her desk. While the thief was being chased by the guards after her very noticeable escape through the window, I dashed to my room and put the cloak in a corner —warded it carefully to prevent detection in case the headmistress decided to rely on magical investigation methods— before leaving the room to join the hunt for the thief. </p><p>Whether to thank her for making my life easier or ruining my plan, I would only know after examining my accidental loot.</p><p>The moment I stepped outside, I was met with total chaos, with people running around like a headless chicken. Apparently, the extensive defensive preparations they deployed against a possible invading army weren’t enough to catch a thief. I wondered whether it was because of the monster hordes forcing the school to deploy the elites out, or the effectiveness of the spies inside the school sabotaging the defense efforts. </p><p>Regardless of the reason, however, it didn’t bid well for the survival chances of the school, even with the magical defenses updated. I really needed to come back and pay some attention to it. </p><p>But before that, I needed to catch a naughty thief and teach her a lesson. After sneaking out of the school, I was quick to cast a spell that was quickly becoming my most favorite one, and summoned another elemental mount. </p><p>[-1183 Mana]</p><p>With the speed advantage it granted, it hadn’t been difficult to catch up with the thief and a large group of guards following her. The headmistress was absent. Unfortunately, I didn’t know whether it was because she didn’t want to have the risk to act and get ambushed like Titania had been ambushed earlier, or the stuff I managed to steal wasn’t important for her to bother acting. </p><p>Also, pity that she had used her cloak to wrap her body completely, not giving me another glimpse of her curvy body wrapped in a leather bodysuit. </p><p>I watched from a distance —with an illusion to cover my presence— as the guards attacked the thief again and again with a dangerous mixture of ranged weapons and spell attacks, only for our thief to dance between the attacks. It was an impressive combination of skills, stats, and endless practice, and even more impressive because I could see that she wasn’t stretching herself to her limits. </p><p>I was wondering the benefits of intervening to look like I took her down to get some brownie points from the headmistress —but not actually catch her, as doing so would remove my convenient scapegoat. I didn’t hurry up, because, despite the relentless attack, she was yet to attack back. </p><p>However, as she ducked and weaved between the attack with beautiful grace, I noticed a pattern in a particular direction the thief was driving the guards. I prepared myself to intervene. While my sense of belonging to the school was shaky, it wasn’t shaky enough to actually let them be killed by a bunch of random people. I gathered my mana, ready to cast an inferno that would turn the thief and everything fifty feet around her to remove the even slightest hope of escaping —and also conveniently giving me an excuse about the lack of books and other trinkets in the possession of her body— when her dark figure delved through overgrowth and dashed out at the other side… </p><p>Or more accurately, a dark figure dashed through the other side of the overgrowth. It wasn’t a disguise in the first place despite the advantages given by her cloaked body. The new figure was taller by a couple of inches, for example, not to mention lacking her natural grace when she displayed during her endless dodging. </p><p>But there was no hope for them to trick me, because, from the difference in their movement, it was clear that the new figure was a man. Just the way he stepped was enough to reveal that. </p><p>The new figure dashed forward furiously, using pure speed to open the distance between him and the group, luring them away from the outgrowth. A rather impressive switch, I noted as I watched them disappear, satisfied with their lack of actual violence. </p><p>From what I could read from her abilities, the thief herself was alone to take a significant portion of the group down, and the man that took her place as decoy didn’t look any weaker. They could have taken down the guards if the man had ambushed them, but instead, they were being really careful to handle things without violence. </p><p>So, I stayed back with a clean conscience, hiding myself —rather easily, as I was still under the effect of the weird buff I received from the crystal platform— while I waited for my sexy thief to step out of the outgrowth. </p><p>And she did so after five minutes, dashing forward at a decent pace. I followed her with a wide smile, because without the absence of a respectable horde of guards, she had finally loosened the cloak around herself, giving me a better view of her body, wrapped in tight leather, her strong legs tightening with every step deliciously, tempting me to unwrap her from that leather outfit like a gift, curious what I would find underneath. </p><p>I just needed to find her destination. </p><p>I hadn’t had to wait for long, as barely twenty minutes of desperate dash later, she finally arrived at a caravan, and sneaked into it. It was a large caravan, surrounded with a well-armored guard regiment, clearly proficient. The first layer of the guards hadn’t even noticed her presence, but I saw a guard defending one of the inner carts move slightly to allow her to pass easily. She clearly belonged to that caravan. I didn’t follow her, because the guards surrounded the inner coaches looked too strong to trick easily. And if the damaged state of the carts and the guards were any indicator, things were clearly not </p><p>Unfortunately, it wasn’t convenient for me to attack the group, because of one important detail. The caravan was flying the personal standard of the Royal family, which meant only one thing. </p><p>The crown princess had finally arrived. </p><p>I couldn’t help but sigh as I decided to return to the school. The current situation was complicated enough with the necromancers, their spies, a mysterious organization with the ability to control monsters and create artificial warriors, the surprising twist about the true nature of the headmistress… Things were hard to navigate enough before adding a royal family member who was supposed to be in the school just to craft a weapon, but turned out to be daring enough to steal stuff from the most secure room from the </p><p>And while technically it was possible that it wasn’t the crown princess that sent the thief, that wasn’t good news if that was the case. Because if there was someone in the royal caravan that could not only send such a capable thief out but also arrange a guard to ignore her presence but with a differing goal from the princess herself, that wouldn’t help any in terms of a complicated situation. So, I really hoped the princess was responsible for the thievery. </p><p>I started traveling the same route, my mind occupied by the possible ramifications of the latest revelations, and whether I could turn them to my own benefit… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 30    Experience: 447193 / 465000 </p><p>Strength: 41    Charisma: 53</p><p>Precision: 35    Perception: 37</p><p>Agility: 35     Manipulation: 40</p><p>Speed: 34       Intelligence: 44</p><p>Endurance: 34      Wisdom: 46</p><p>HP: 5370  / 5370\tMana: 6219  / 6600        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]    </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100]        </p><p>Master Subterfuge [97/100]     </p><p>Expert Speech [70/75]</p><p>Advanced Craft [50/50]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 21/25]</p><p>[Helga - Level 17/21]</p>",

    "content": "<p>The silence that stretched as Carrie slowly slipped in the pool gently without breaking the water, while Sarah watched her with shock, and no small amount of jealously —though clearly unaware of the latter. It wasn’t that she was a bad girl, but clearly, she was having trouble processing the amazing display Carrie was putting with her red bikini —one that was supposed to be modest, but failed to contain Carrie’s boundless curves. </p><p>The silence reigned as Carrie swam toward us. I was mesmerized as I watched her voluptuous body slice across the water. And from what I could decipher from Sarah’s expression, I wasn’t the only one that was mesmerized by her movement. The way she wore her bikini was already amazing before her action pushed the already strained capacity to the limit, stretching beautifully. The cups of her bikini top barely held her large breasts, and as her ass floated, the bottom clung to her ass very tightly. </p><p>There was an unusual smirk on her lips as she finally came to a stop next to us. “So, what were you guys talking about?” she asked with a smooth casualness that had to be intentional. Her confidence was clearly being fueled by Sarah’s attitude. </p><p>It would be a lie to say that I was unhappy about that. It wouldn’t be the first time I enjoy the fruits of two good friends feeling trying to outdo each other. </p><p>“Nothing much, we were just chatting about the classes,” Sarah answered, but only after a noticeable delay. </p><p>“Yeah, just chitchatting,” I added, before making a comment about today’s cafeteria lunch, launching casual chitchat as we chilled on the pool for the next half an hour. Sarah lost her hesitation after her initial shock, but her tenseness didn’t evaporate completely even after a few minutes. I noticed her low-key jealousy simmering underneath her calm response. </p><p>Carrie noticed that as well, and decided to fuel it further, which was our plan in the first place. As we spoke, she slid closer to me, touching my arm and shoulder for one than once. “So, any thoughts about college life?” Carrie asked. “Do you think it’ll be better than high school?” </p><p>“I don’t know,” I answered with a smirk as I let my gaze dip down slowly, enjoying the sight of her enticing cleavage for an extended time before turning my gaze to Sarah and repeated the action, not bothering to hide the glint in my gaze. “College needs to be pretty damn good to surpass my high school experience.” </p><p>The way they both blushed under my hungry gaze was beautiful. However, since Carrie was much more familiar with my flirting —and much more— she recovered from her blush quicker. She made a show of checking my muscular shoulders before responding. “Well, I can see the logic,” she gasped. </p><p>Sarah’s expression of shock as Carrie flirted me openly shocked her even more than her choice of swimsuit. She staggered as I put my arm on Carrie’s bare shoulder, enjoying the warmth of her skin as we had a flirtatious pool chat. </p><p>As we talked, her body started to react to my presence honestly. While her lower body was buried underwater, making it hard for me to be sure whether she was subtly rubbing her legs together, the presence of her nipples, getting more and more visible through her swimsuit, was significantly easier to notice. </p><p>And I wasn’t the only one to notice that. </p><p>From the corner of my eye, I watched as Sarah’s expression stiffen in determination while Carrie focused on flirting with me, especially when Carrie was touching me. </p><p>“So, Chad,” Sarah said as she scooted closer in a moment Carrie’s flirting stalled. “I was recently thinking about start exercising. Do you have any recommendations?” </p><p>“Why you decided to ask me?” I said mockingly, even though her plan was rather obvious. </p><p>“I’m guessing that exercise takes quite a bit of your time,” Sarah countered, but her words were as pointless as my rhetorical question. Her real aim was to reach my arm and caress my biceps, like she was making a point, conveniently positioning her body between me and Carrie as she did so. “You certainly have the evidence for it.” </p><p>“That’s a fair assumption,” I said with a smirk, while Sarah kept her hand on my biceps in a pointed manner, squeezing. “There’s not much I can recommend. You just need the discipline.” </p><p>Sarah listened attentively as I listed several basic exercises she could use, but didn't take her hand off my arm. “That sounds useful,” she murmured. I could see the collapse of Carrie’s self-confidence the real-time as Sarah continued to question me about the advantages and disadvantages of various exercises, getting handsier as she did so. </p><p>I didn’t stop her for three reasons. The first reason was that it was a part of Carrie’s challenge. The whole point was to prove to her friend that she was a confident woman that could handle her own flirting, and a part of that was to defend her territory when another female tried to cut in. </p><p>The second reason was that I was amused by the way jealousy drove Sarah to stab her friend in the back without the slightest hesitation, too envious to actually realize the potential impact it might have on her friendship. Though, considering the dynamics of their friendship group, I was willing to believe that it was simple oversight rather than maliciousness. Still, it was rather fun. And just to make things more fun, I doubted Sarah was consciously aware of her emotional journey. </p><p>And the third reason was that I saw absolutely no reason to reject them as a fit brunette, sexy despite her relatively conservative swimsuit, flirting with me in a pool. </p><p>So, when she decided to change the dry topic of best exercise methodology, I wasn’t surprised. “It’s getting chilly out there. Let’s go inside and play a game instead,” she said with an excessive cheeriness, her sharp tone back in the discussion. </p><p>“Sure,” I said as I turned to Carrie, checking for her response. </p><p>“Fine by me,” Carrie said, but her casual confidence which she was building carefully during the discussion took a substantial hit as she noticed Sarah’s playful smile. Apparently, her external confidence that was born from her daring display wasn’t as stable as I had first assumed. “What do you have in mind?” </p><p>“It’s not a big crowd, but that’s nothing preventing us from turning it into a proper party,” Sarah said, satisfied with the sudden shift of the discussion as she walked at the edge of the pool, and put her hands on the side before pulling herself up. “Let’s play some truth and dare.” </p><p>To make things more fun, Sarah took her sweet time pulling herself up, giving us an extended view of her bottom. It was a tight ass, her best feature without the slightest doubt, and the extended show suggested that she decided to counter Carrie’s advantage directly. </p><p>Admittedly, it was an effective strategy. </p><p>I watched her slow climb in appreciation, and my focused gaze on her ass dealt another blow to Carrie’s already trembling confidence. A more confident person might have poked my side to punish me from my gaze, but Carrie just wilted silently. </p><p>A little assistance was needed, I decided. I scooted closer to Carrie and grabbed her ass aggressively. She jumped up in shock, a little yelp escaping her mouth, which made Sarah turn toward her and ask curiously. “Is there something wrong?” </p><p>“N-no, I just hit my toe,” she stammered, the relative darkness of the garden not enough to hide her furious blush, but since I already took a couple steps forward when Sarah turned to look, there was nothing to be suspicious. Sarah continued her climb, but after being distracted by Carrie’s interlude, she climbed quicker, abandoning her picturesque approach. </p><p>After Sarah turned away, I sent a saucy wink to Carrie before climbing after Sarah, leaving Carrie blushing in the pool. “So, Chad, the bathroom is upstairs, right?” Sarah asked as she put her hand on my forearm in a manner that was supposed to be casually, but in practice, happened rather clunky. Still, I wasn’t going to go as far as to tell that it wasn’t effective, as while it was delivered clumsily, it was still delivered by a sexy girl wearing a cute black bikini, still glistening. </p><p>I could have offered her the one on the ground floor, but having her on the second floor worked to my benefit. “You can use that, it’s the second door on the right,” I said with a smirk. </p><p>Sarah just smiled before turning back and leaving the garden with an excessive sway of her hips. Apparently, her determination to set me up with Carrie didn’t survive for long under the stirrings of her jealousy. </p><p>No surprise that many friendships between women were destroyed by love triangles. </p><p>As Sarah disappeared in the stairs, I helped Carrie to climb out of the pool. She was still blushing, but avoided my gaze. “Is there something wrong?” I asked. “You are kind of off in the last few minutes. Have you changed your mind about making her pay?” As I talked, I grabbed her waist and pulled her closer, until her covered breasts were pressing against my chest, which was enough to pull her from her funk. </p><p>“N-no, I didn’t,” she stammered. “I was just feeling a bit overwhelmed,” she explained. </p><p>I caressed her cheek. “Come on, sweetie. There’s nothing to be ashamed of, not from me at least. Just do your best.” </p><p>“I know, but I feel self-conscious.” </p><p>“You need to challenge yourself more,” I said with a sigh. “Are you going to try, or should we just call it off?” </p><p>My suggestion of disappointment seemed to work. Her expression stiffened. “No, I will continue,” she said. </p><p>My smile widened into a smirk. “Then, let’s test your resolve,” I said even as I grabbed the strings of her bottom, and with a tug, pulled them free. As she gasped, reaching desperately for her bottoms, I repeated the trick with her top, leaving her completely naked. </p><p>“Chad!” she gasped in shock. </p><p>She only received a teasing gaze from me. “You better rush to the showers if you don’t want to be caught by Sarah,” I reminded her, and she dashed in the house, giving me a scene worthy of an R-rated version of a Baywatch remake. I just chuckled as I watched, happy with the way the night was developing… </p>",

    "content": "<p>I didn’t need to think a lot to decide my next move, because Aria started to move before I could make a decision. She started rubbing her body against mine, her enthusiasm not lessened even a bit. </p><p>Unsurprisingly, my body reacted in kind, my erection returning to life almost immediately. “Someone is a morning person,” I said with a chuckle even as she climbed on top of me. She might be used to the carnal side of our relationship, but that hardly meant that she was used to teasing, even the simple kind I had been using right now. Her blush intensified as she staggered, avoiding my gaze. She tried to slide off my lap. “Hey, I didn’t say I don’t like it,” I said, colored with a horny smile. </p><p>“Sorry,” she murmured, ducking her head. </p><p>“Hey,” I murmured, caressing her cheek as I did so. “There’s nothing to apologize for. It’s not something to be faulted. Try to be a bit more confident.” </p><p>“I don’t know…” she murmured, but rather than sliding off my lap, she stayed on to continue grind against my shaft, which counted as a great success. “Sorry, please don’t take it seriously,” she added. “It’s just that people always have so many expectations from their princess, it sometimes feels overwhelming,” she murmured. </p><p>“People are always like that,” I answered with a shrug. “It’s actually not about your position. No matter your strength, if you don’t put a barrier, people will ask you more and more.” Even as I explained, however, I had to keep myself from laughing at the irony of the moment. I, Byron Mordred, the dark lord who loomed over the Empire as an everpresent intimidating threat, was giving counseling to the princess of the said Empire while she rubbed her naked body against mine. </p><p>It was certainly a moment too surreal to be real. </p><p>“You need to learn to exert yourself more,” I told her. </p><p>“I don’t know,” she murmured. </p><p>“Why don’t we have a little try,” I said with a smirk. “Why don’t you try it with me?” I said as I raised my arms, and cast a simple spell, which made the bed covers wrap around like chains. “I’m under your mercy, exert your will.” </p><p>“You’re so bad,” she murmured, but considering her spectacular blush and her positioning, it was the most flirtatious mannerism she had displayed to date. “Then, start moving your hips,” she said as she slapped my chest. </p><p>Her mannerism as she tried to be domineering was thoroughly amusing, but I somehow managed to keep myself from laughing. Instead, I followed her request. She moved her hips against mine in rhythm, which made the moment even more delicious. </p><p>“Worship me,” she ordered as she leaned forward, her breasts pushing against my chest, giving me a sensation I could never get sick of. </p><p>“Your body is a work of art, Aria. You’re the pearl of the Empire, the thing that Anyone who doesn't appreciate every inch of you is an idiot.\"</p><p>She blushed, glancing down, which made her look at her exposed breasts. It wasn’t exactly the aura of a dominatrix, but that was to be expected considering her utter lack of experience in exerting will in any way. Still, after a shrug, she focused back on her actions, putting her hands on my shoulder as she continued to grind. “Grab my tits,” she ordered. </p><p>“As you wish, my princess,” I said even as I tugged my impromptu ties, making them fall off rather easily. Surprisingly, before I could reach her chest, she actually took my hand and dragged it at my chest. I saw the desire in her eyes, but also hesitation, feeling self-conscious about actually taking the lead. </p><p>I gently cupped my hand around her mounds, once again enjoying the fullness of that marvelous bust. Aria closed her eyes and murmured. “That feels nice.” She looked unbelievably beautiful at that moment, powerfully aroused but also relieved; finally exploring an aspect of herself that she had been denying for years under the expectations of her cold mother and the expectations of the public. </p><p>Of course, her emotional struggles didn’t affect the softness of her naked body in any way, every rocking of her hips giving me intense pleasure. I moved my hands to the space between her tits, caressing them from the inside out. My thumbs sought out her perfect nipples, delicately swirling around them. </p><p>That worked wonderfully to distract her from the existential crisis she was suffering. She leaned forward and kissed me passionately, while she simultaneously grabbed my hands to pull them deeper into the soft flesh of her breasts, her body shaking with desire. She was kissing me hungrily, with an active passion she had never displayed before. </p><p>It was a good moment. In Aria’s bed, with her softness above me, grinding at my erection. </p><p>Amazingly, it got even better, because, without any prompting from my end, Aria moved her hips and my shaft disappeared into her core, wrapped with her warmth. </p><p>“Do it, push inside me,” she begged even as she pushed her weight down, swallowing my length the best way possible. As the pleasure hit, she squeezed my hands even tighter, making my fingers disappear in her bosom. “You feel amazing inside me,” she gasped. </p><p>It seemed that my physical attention was a good enough emotional motivator for my emotionally neglected princess. </p><p>Still, her emotionally stunted development stole nothing from her beauty. With her deliciously plump legs around me, her hips smashing against mine repeatedly. Her golden curls danced freely as she moved her hips, occasionally sticking on her swelling pink tits. Her fair skin flushed with excitement further. </p><p>It was a good time to be completely naked, I thought as Aria pulled back from the kiss for a breather, still jumping up and down which made her succulent tits dangle erotically. But somehow, the aroused shine in her blue eyes suppressed the visual impact created by her delicious body. Her arousal was climbing more and more. </p><p>Therefore, I was really surprised when she suddenly pulled out.  </p><p>\"Is something wrong?\" I asked, trying to regulate my breathing. </p><p>\"No, nothing. This is amazing,\" she murmured. \"I just want to make sure this moment lasts as long as it can.\"</p><p>I might have complained about that, but when she turned her back. “Hug me,” she ordered, and I did that gladly, spooning her gently, using the opportunity to slip inside her once more. </p><p>The embrace was delicious, with my arms snug around her waist, her body pushing against mine. It was like a romantic dance, except my hands were wandering in areas that would have created a scandal in any civilized party even if we had been dressed. Then, she looked at me and we started kissing. </p><p>As we kissed, Aria pressed herself against me, tighter, our bodies mashed together. My shaft disappeared into her slit repeatedly, soaking in her warm arousal. “Hug me tighter,” she begged, and I did so, fulfilling her request with all the sincerity I could muster. I fingered her swollen nipples as I did so, making her moan even louder. </p><p>It was a beautiful moment. </p><p>After an extended hug, she tightened around me, which triggered an explosion from me, filling her insides as well. I hugged her tighter as she trembled, enjoying the aftershocks. It was a beautiful moment. </p><p>“It’s too bad that you’re going to leave one day for the dark lands, leaving me alone,” she murmured after her climax subsided. </p><p>I let out an amused smirk, entertained by her acceptance of my freedom. Though, considering the ease I was walking around the palace, it wasn’t an unfair assumption. If it wasn’t for the other reasons that made the dark lands unhospitable for me, I would have long deserted my cell. </p><p>“And, you would be sad to see me leaving?” I asked softly. </p><p>“Of course,” she murmured as she suddenly turned, our faces meeting. She blushed furiously, but that didn’t prevent her from looking at me with loving eyes. “I would miss you greatly.” </p><p>Honestly, I was surprised by the intensity of her look. I didn’t know when the affection she felt toward me had intensified to such a degree, but it seemed the simple kindness of bringing her a breakfast seemed to finally solidify her emotions into a delicious reflection of love. </p><p>It left me a difficult question, should I accept her confession completely, make her a proper member of my harem, or keep her at arms’ length… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Mark Watson was not a particularly good man, and he made peace with that fact. </p><p>He wouldn’t exactly define himself as evil. He, after all, decided to stop being a lawyer in his own violation, even though it was more about boredom than altruism. It was exciting to be the high-powered lawyer, winning cases through his pure charisma, playing the jury like puppets to protect rich assholes and criminal lowlifes, and earning a lot of money in the process. </p><p>The fact that he managed to do that for almost a decade with a fake degree was the true achievement. </p><p>But after the fifth year of his career, the excitement started to die, his life filled with paperwork and boring client meetings. He needed to move on, yet he was too lethargic to actually move. </p><p>At that point, he started to get reckless, to a point that he started to drop hints around his fellow lawyers about his fake degree. At the moment, he justified that recklessness as a way to prove himself clever, but looking back, it was a cry to be caught, forcing himself out of his fancy career without him admitting anything. </p><p>Too bad that his so-called rival Henry was a true idiot. </p><p>If he had been honest with himself, he would have chosen that point in time to leave the firm, or at least, take an extended leave of absence to explore his life goals. Instead, true to himself, he chose to throw himself to the hardest cases available, the horrible pro-bono cases taken in on a contingency basis just to raise the firm profile, to be given to the new lawyers or worst-performing associates. Tim had been shocked when he requested him in a private meeting, while the rest of the firm led by Henry cheered from the side, thinking that Mark’s star was finally dimming. </p><p>Then, Mark won his first case with impeccable preparation and a passionate closing speech that actually made the defense lawyer cry, shocking the firm, though their shock was nothing compared to when he had won the second case, or the third, or the fourth… The firm was silenced, his prospects were brighter than ever, his previous detractors trying to join his side… It was a certainty that he would be the next partner. </p><p>And Mark never felt emptier… </p><p>Ironically, the epiphany hit him in the middle of a moment that was supposed to be glorious, undressing two beauties that he managed to pick up from the bar, one redhead and one blonde, both beautiful enough to work as models. But just as they were being undressed, Mark was struck with a sense of Deja Vu, remembering all the times he had repeated the trick of picking beautiful ladies from the bar for meaningless one-night stands. He gritted his teeth and continued, but each moment turned his epiphany to the dread, making him realize the utter emptiness of his life… </p><p>The worst way to end a delicious threesome…  </p><p>He hadn’t slept a wink for the whole night, looking at the ceiling while two sexy ladies slept next to him, naked, snuggling. Luckily, the ladies were acquainted with the bar pickup etiquette enough to know not to expect anything, and disappeared when he returned from the gym… </p><p>As he looked at his empty apartment, there was only one thing in her mind. He needed something else… </p><p>*****     *****     *****     *****     *****     </p><p>In the end, even Mark could hardly believe the decision he had taken. After all, who leaves a law firm on the cusp of becoming a partner to join a shitty community college. Mark knew that if it wasn’t for his impressive streak of impossible wins, people would have assumed that his leaving was a poorly-thought-out excuse for firing him. Instead, people thought that it was a shallow excuse to stay away from the firm just enough to exhaust his non-compete clause before joining a rival firm to start his own. </p><p>Mark didn’t care enough to explain —except to Thomas, of course, who was his only genuine friend, who understood him, but also offered him a blank check, saying all it would take a call to start a new company together. Mark nodded in understanding, even though he knew that it was unlikely. Consulting, maybe, but he doubted he could handle the workload of a full partner. </p><p>Luckily, Ted —the leading partner of the firm— didn’t believe him either, and much to Mark’s surprise, offered Mark a ridiculously high severance package —which also prevented him from working for a rival firm for five years, just enough for his reputation to fade— after plying him with alcohol and good stories all night, thinking that he was hiding his nervousness. Mark signed without any hesitance, letting Ted think that he had managed to get one over him, while he made enough money to live the rest of his life decently without an obligation to work.</p><p>Or to have the most amazing midlife crisis in his life, but a voice in the back of his head —the one that was trying to make him quit— was telling Mark that doing so would end up him dead in the bathroom of a five-star hotel, doing drugs from the navel of a high-class escort. </p><p>So instead, he enrolled in a small community college, North Star, hoping to use the silence to finally discover what he wanted. </p><p>*****     *****     *****     *****     *****     </p><p>North Star Community College was both better and worse than he had expected. Worse, because it was a dirty, overblown, under-budgeted mess. Better, because it was so horrible that he didn’t felt the slightest inclination to actually exert himself in the informal hierarchy of the place, even with a lifetime of conditioning in the law firm. </p><p>Even without revealing the amount of money in his bank account, keeping his best Italian-tailored clothes in his wardrobe, and hiding the illustrious account of his unlikely case wins that shook the whole state, he was still on the top of the hierarchy, thanks to his looks and his quiet confidence. His silent charisma was enough to distinguish himself from the hopeless crowd. </p><p>Which was a nice thing, he admitted, because even with the recent changes in his life perspective, he doubted his ego could handle being just another one in the crowd. So, even when he was scrunched in the back of the class, silent and dour, people watched him. Understandable considering he was six foot four with a spectacularly sculpted body that didn’t reveal his true age. </p><p>People gossiped about him being a failed or disbarred lawyer, of course, but he didn’t bother to argue against it. First being he really didn’t care about what a bunch of losers said, the second being that any effort he put to deny it would further flame the discussion, making it rather unproductive. </p><p>And since he wasn’t burning with insecurity, he didn’t try to cover it up by trying to hit the rare sexy girl that he shared his class with. Neither the aggressive opinionated blonde with a frantic pseudo-activist mentality, nor the brunette studious older beauty that tagged every single soccer mom cliche perfectly made him act. </p><p>As a nice benefit, it helped him to stay away from their frantic lives, be it waving posters and signing petitions, or endless activities for the children. Without the burning insecurity that forced him to be someone he was not, he really didn’t want to act. </p><p>Since he wasn’t distracted by trying to get in the pants of the beauties, he decided to waste his time in a different way. He observed the class with all the skills he had sharpened during his stint as a lawyer. </p><p>It was the sixth week of the class when he noticed really noticed Laura May, a young petite brunette who was barely above her legal age. He was aware of her, of course. It was hard to miss an enthusiastic student that he had shared three classes with, doing her best to be seen in every single one of them, but Mark was ready to write her off as yet another enthusiastic yet incapable nerd. After all, with the clear enthusiasm she was showing, if she had been any good, she wouldn’t be in a community college. But since she answered roughly half of the questions asked to class —and half only because most of the teachers allowed the others to answer first if there were any volunteers, leaving only the hardest half to her— Mark inevitably continued to pay attention to her. </p><p>However, as time passed, Mark was forced to update his first impression, because Laura was a smart girl, answering each question perfectly in all three classes. Moreover, he had watched enough fakers to know that she wasn’t coasting on preexisting knowledge while also showing an aptitude far above what was required by a community college, especially one as bad as North Star—or she was good enough in acting to actually trick Mark, which was even more unbelievable. </p><p>With her intelligence and work ethic -proven by the piles of books she was hauling to every class including suggested material- she should have been able to get a seat in a real college, probably one in Ivy-level. He had certainly worked with fewer bright lawyers with degrees from those schools. </p><p>It was possible that her family was not in a position to afford a real college, of course, but it was a bet, Mark wouldn’t have chosen that option. There was something deeper going on. Her relatively expensive but childishly conservative clothing and her innocent prude ways, however, suggested a conservative upbringing. In the end, he wrote it off as a likely fight with her family. He was intrigued, but only enough to get a fleeting part of his attention, with no intention of acting. </p><p>When he noticed that she was actually carrying a gun in her handbag, he felt more curious, but once again not taking any action. </p><p>At least, not until Thomas —the jock who clearly still thought of himself in high school, decided to respond to her poor attempts to keep him away from the football team by revealing a pill addiction in the middle of the cafeteria, when she tried to remind him that they were friends, before spitting a few more details like rehab and a breakdown that ended up ruining the classroom.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the rest of the students turned their gazes on Laura, some with judgment, some with pity, and but most with the excitement of finding yet another dirty little secret that would make themselves feel better about their horrible life choices. Laura’s perfectionism and pristine reputation worked against her at that moment, as purer the target, more enjoyable was to pull her down in the dirty world of gossip. </p><p>Thomas just left, too childish to realize he had just revealed a big secret of hers, and probably ruined her social life for the rest of her North Star days. Laura stood there, frozen, with a tray of food in her hands. She stood there for a minute, until one of the more horrible students yelled. “Hey, pill chick, move!” </p><p>That worked as a signal. A gasp escaped her mouth as her tray toppled off her hand, hitting the floor with a crash. She dashed away… </p><p>Mark wasn’t a hero, so he didn’t plan to interject, nor he planned to follow her. But also, Mark wasn’t a heartless villain, so, when he noticed that she was running toward the parking lot, likely intending to drive away, he was smart enough to realize just how bad it might end up. So, he stood up and started following her. In her mood, a car crash was almost a certainty. </p><p>She ran away frantically, but Mark was almost double her petite size, so he caught up with her easily, following her from a few feet away. She was too distracted to notice his presence, at least until she tried to pull open her car door, only to notice his hand preventing it from opening. </p><p>“What do you want!” she exclaimed between sobs as she turned toward him. </p><p>“Calm down,” Mark said in a kind tone, one he often used when he was talking with vulnerable witnesses during his trials, not wanting to alarm her, especially he noticed her hand dipping to her bag, the same one that held a gun. Her hand stilled, and Mark felt his heartbeat slowing down. It wasn’t the first time he faced the risk of being shot, but funnily enough, a hysteric girl half his size was scarier than a professional hitman with a gun —a nasty memory from the time he had been handling mob cases. Unpredictability was a dangerous thing… </p><p>“What do you want?” she repeated, calm enough not to shout, but tears still spilling down her cheeks. </p><p>“For now, I want you to keep away from the wheel, at least until I’m reasonably sure that you won’t have an accident,” Mark explained, still talking calmly. </p><p>“Why do you care!” she said, once again louder, but the tenseness on her shoulders abated just a bit, showing his approach was working. When she turned her blue wide eyes to him, shining with tears, the residual lawyer in him wished that she was a witness he could play in front of a jury. Just a glance at her Bambi look would have been enough to win a case. </p><p>“If we lose you, who’s going to distract teachers in class with their pointless bickering,” Mark answered with the slightest smile. </p><p>“Hey!” she exclaimed, but Mark counted himself victorious when she let out a wet chuckle. He let his smile widen enough to comfort her and opened his arms invitingly. A moment later, she hit his midsection like a cannon, crying badly. </p><p>“And my shirt is in ruins,” Mark said even as he patted her shoulder, earning another weak chuckle as she cried. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I had to admit, as I pulled back to catch the beautiful sight of Anna’s body wrapped in nothing but moonlight, still writhing under the effects of her climax, I was supremely tempted to stop what were we doing, pull a canvas, and start painting, no matter how tempting the carnal activities were. </p><p>Honestly, if I only had one night to spend with this beautiful blonde, I might have chosen to paint a beautiful remembrance of her. Luckily, we still have quite a bit in our planned journey, and I was confident in my abilities to put the same expression on her beautiful face. </p><p>Then, I shifted in the bed, lying next to her, and left a gentle kiss on her neck as I waited for her to recover. “So, my sweet Anna,” I whispered as her trembling started to subside. “Are you ready for the main event?” </p><p>“I … maybe,” she stammered, a sudden blush invading her face as she evaded my gaze, hesitation clear on her expression. And from the sudden blush that invaded her face, she was clearly feeling self-conscious about saying that. “I don’t know…”</p><p>“You don’t have to,” I said with a calm voice, not wanting to push her forward. I might have felt a little sadness as I did so, but that was if I had the slightest doubt that she might follow that direction. After invading my supposed bed several nights, the last with the full intention of losing her virginity, I doubted that a delicious orgasm would suddenly push her toward the other direction. </p><p>Just like I expected, several seconds of silence was all that needed to change her mind. She leaned forward to kiss my neck, mirroring my earlier action with a level of enthusiasm that made me quite happy. She failed to maintain eye contact, too shy to even catch a glimpse, avoiding my eyes even as she moaned. However, unlike her shy gaze, the rest of her body language begged me to act. </p><p>And who was I to disappoint? </p><p>I touched her shoulder gently, pushing her until she was on her back. As I shifted above her, her legs parted invitingly. I wrapped my arm around her waist as I pressed my shaft against her entrance. “Are you ready, sweetheart?” I whispered even as I pushed my shaft against her entrance, slipping in slightly, but not to the point of no return. </p><p>Her answer came rather more direct than I expected it to. Her arms wrapped around my torso, giving me the momentum necessary to disappear inside her. A gasp of pain escaped her mouth as she graduated from her status, but I was quick to suppress that with a lingering kiss. </p><p>The first push was rather difficult, forcing her walls to expand painfully. “Damn,” she managed to murmur between kisses, but as I carefully paced her to ease her pain, she was quick to adapt, showing that endless foreplay we had conducted was not a waste. </p><p>Then, before I started moving, I decided to spice up the movement and brought my hand to her breasts, sinking into their delicious expanse, enjoying their softness. Just as she moaned, I finally started rocking my hips. Surprisingly, she took the rhythm with surprising smoothness, giving me another surprise about her capabilities. For all her supposed shyness, she was a proper fox in the bed. </p><p>“Delicious,” I murmured, which made her shake her hips with a greater vigor while I pushed in repeatedly, finally stretching her beautiful entrance for the first time. A delayed achievement for her, but considering her final prize, well worth the wait —even if I was being a touch arrogant. </p><p>“It feels amazing,” she moaned as I pushed halfway in, followed by a whimper. It was a cute, needy whimper, one that tempted me to go faster. Considering that I was already being tempted by the way her wet tunnel wrapped around my entrance for its first time voyage, treating me with her endless warmth, arousing me further was a true achievement. </p><p>I decided to reward her for the achievement. My hands drifted down to her buttocks, clamping around for extra leverage before I pushed further, and she let out an even more delicious whimper as my shaft disappeared deeper into her entrance. </p><p>“How do you feel, sweetie?” I asked even as I pushed most of my length inside her, much to her enthusiasm. </p><p>“I feel … amazing!” she shouted recklessly, leveraging the complete absence of any kind of civilization near us by stretching her lungs to the limit. I was happy with the effect for more than one reason. Her emotional discharge was satisfying, but so was the way her tits trembled as she shouted to her heart’s content. </p><p>So much that, I leaned to capture her nipples between my teeth once more to give a little invigorating bite even as lost none of its pace as it slid in and out repeatedly, gaining great critical acclaim. As she got used to my presence, I finally decided to show my true capabilities. I sped up to a degree that might have been classified as merciless for her first time, but her enthusiastic moans as I repeatedly rammed inside her disagreed with that assumption. </p><p>“Fuck me harder!” she begged as her legs clamped around my waist, clumsily pulling me even deeper, though her lack of grace didn’t affect her sexiness the slightest bit. Tonight, she was an incarnation of Aphrodite, oozing sexiness no matter what she did. </p><p>I couldn’t help but keep my gaze on her beautiful figure, wearing nothing but her birthday suit, her core greedily devouring my length again and again. As she arched her back, she inevitably displayed her breasts to best effect, begging for me to abandon her hips in favor of continuing to squeeze them, to a point of leaving my mark. </p><p>When she started trembling under the effect of another climax, I decided to change the pace a bit. I pulled out and sat on the side of the bed. </p><p>It earned a disappointed moan off her. “We’re finished?” she murmured, her disappointment clear. </p><p>I couldn’t help but chuckle at her insatiable desire. Despite being a virgin until hours ago, she wasn’t satisfied with back-to-back climaxes. She was so lucky that her first time wasn’t with a bumbling nerdy teenager, who would have left her gasping in disappointment. </p><p>“Oh, my sweet Anna, we’re not even close to the finishing line,” I answered even as I grabbed her waist and pulled her to my lap with an ease that was only possible through my obsessive fitness habits. </p><p>She found herself sitting on my lap, our faces inches away. A gasp escaped her mouth as she found herself skewered with my presence through an unfamiliar angle. She was quick to lift herself though, which made me wonder whether she had a problem with the new position. However, the way she slammed herself back just as she was about to pull away completely corrected my perception the best way possible </p><p>I said nothing, just enjoying her enthusiasm as she rocked her hips on my lap with an endearing clumsiness that might have been cute if it wasn’t for her complete naked state, and her amazing curves. Instead, it was an erotic feast that I enjoyed immensely. </p><p>Unfortunately, despite her great enthusiasm, her pace soon started to fall, showing the signs of exhaustion, finally paying for the cost of the orgasms she had experienced. I tightened my grip around her waist, assisting her enthusiastic grinding with the power of my muscles. </p><p>Then, without a warning, my arms tightened further, and I stood up. She let out a yelp when she found herself in the air, her weight pushing my shaft to a depth I hadn’t reached before, but she could do nothing but wrap her legs around my waist. “Hold tight,” I suggested as I walked toward the shower, each step allowing me to explore her depths in a completely novel way. </p><p>When we arrived at the destination, I pushed her back against the slick wall of the shower, and turned on the water, the warm caresses of the liquid adding another layer of pleasure. She just moaned helplessly as the water got rid of our sweat with a gentle caress, overwhelmed by the assault of different sensations. </p><p>Her lips parted for another loud cry that threatened to break the serenity of the wilderness that surrounded us, but this time, my domineering kiss was ready to suppress her. Her cry vibrated in my mouth, tempting me to impale her even harder, which in turn made her cry even louder. Lost in a cycle of eternal pleasure, it wasn’t surprising for her to collapse into another orgasm. </p><p>As she trembled, I let her feet touch the wet floor, but I didn’t loosen my grip around her waist. There was no chance that her trembling legs could support the weight of her delicious body. </p><p>However, there was a little problem. I was yet to climax. Luckily, she seemed to be more than ready to provide a solution. “Loosen your grip,” she asked me, and when I did so, she fell on her knees, and wrapped her delicious tits around my length. Her tits were already amazing, and with the addition of the shower gel and the warm water, the valley between her breasts was heavenly. </p><p>I pushed frantically as she pressed her breasts, her eyes closed to fully enjoy the moment. I was already close, so it didn’t take long for me to explode, momentarily covering her face with my seed before the hot water dragged it away. </p><p>Once the worst of her trembling subsided, I helped her to stand up, helping her to stop her body in a leisure manner, enjoying the moment of tenderness. Though, I couldn’t help but chuckle at her flickering eyelids, signaling that the exhaustion was catching up with her. As we stepped out of the shower, she was already half asleep, struggling to keep her eyes open as I used a towel to dry her body. </p><p>It was definitely not a chore. </p><p>After I dragged her half-unconscious body to the couch that also functioned as her bed. However, after I put her on her bed, I glanced at my own, with covers drenched with a variety of bodily fluids. Instead, I just lay next to her warm body, spooning her gently. </p><p>“Have a nice sleep,” she murmured as she battled the irresistible call of the sandman. </p><p>I kissed her cheek gently before closing my eyes, letting myself fall asleep. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I had to admit, as I watched the headmistress walking toward the middle of the room after closing the door, I was afraid for the first time for a long while, though fear wasn’t alone for long. Because, as the headmistress walked toward the hangers that held her spare cloaks, her back turned against me to display her horrifying hunch, I realized that in a few seconds, I would meet with the horribly-misshapen old crone that was hiding under the cloak, too horrible to be shown even her closest supporters. </p><p>I bit my lips to suppress the inevitable gasp of horror that would escape my lips as her arms moved toward the front of her body and started to unbutton her robe, glad that I was looking at her back, therefore freed from the disgusting sight of her body… </p><p>Then, with one rapid move, she freed her body from her robe and I witnessed her naked body. Shock invaded my body, like an absentminded part of my mind was glad that I was biting my lips to prevent a shocked gasp. Partially because of an unbelievable aura spreading out of her, thick enough to be suffocating, but mostly because of the visuals that resulted from the removal of her robe. </p><p>The sight that I met was as unbelievable as I expected, not just the direction I had expected. I was expecting nothing more than a horribly misshapen old crone, but instead, my eyes met with perfection itself. </p><p>The only thing that conformed with my expectation was the silver hair, and even then, it wasn’t the murky light gray hair of an old person that was called silver just to soften the blow, but the actual color of the freshly-polished silver, together with the shine. </p><p>Her hair was the least impressive part of her. I just focused there, because it gave me a chance to adapt to changes. Then, I moved onto the other important details, her body, and ignoring the most striking part for the moment. </p><p>Her body was literally perfect. Her skin was utterly flawless. I knew that, because under her robe, she wore absolutely nothing, providing me an extended chance to examine her flawless body. She stood in perfect posture, which gave me the perfect angle to examine the perfection that was her ass. It was shaped perfectly, firm and tight, yet suggesting an amazing softness if I could be lucky enough to touch. Meanwhile, her inner thighs begged to be nibbled endlessly… </p><p>She turned and walked toward the crystal in the middle of the room, unknowingly bequeathing me with the privilege of seeing her beauty from the front. Her smooth, perfectly toned stomach beautiful, and her collarbones and her elegant neck were flawless enough to make an army of poets commit suicide due to their inability to describe her perfection through words. And that was before arriving at her face, as flawless as the dawn of a cloudless day peeking over the most beautiful mountain range. </p><p>She was beautiful, but it was not a beauty that belonged to this plane of existence, disguised in an unnatural calm. The absolute stillness of her face, lacking even a hint of emotion, was a part of that perfection, yet it somehow made her less attractive at the same time.  </p><p>Then, there were her breasts. Two globes of perfection begged to be licked again and again to break her smooth expression, to force the imperfection of arousal into her flawless face that looked like that was carved out of marble. </p><p>Of course, her unnatural beauty wasn’t the most shocking thing about her. No, that honor went to a pair of silver wings on her back, matching the color of her hair, only even shinier. Even when gathered on her back, they looked holy, worthy of reverence. </p><p>She was a freaking angel! </p><p>It was certainly a surprise, because the general consensus had been that angels were just a mythological story, with no evidence of their existence. They were supposed to be the servants of the gods, carrying their wills and orders, but just like the existence of the gods, they were supposed to completely fictional. </p><p>And, I watched excitedly as she took a step toward the washbasin, making my excitement peak even higher. From my hidden angle, I  had a perfect view of her back, flawless with a pair of silver wings pointing out, stretching after a day being stuffed under her cloak, faking to be a hunch. I was guessing that it was an uncomfortable feeling. </p><p>I should be considering the best way to escape my circumstances, because I could feel the supernatural control of my mana was slowly fading back. Not quickly enough to make it a problem for the next few minutes, or maybe even the next hour, but just enough to tell me that whatever advantage that crystal bestowed was only temporary. However, I felt it was impossible to pay attention to the amazing sight of a naked angel, about to have a bath in front of me. </p><p>I watched as she filled the basin completely before casting a very intense light magic on the water, suggesting that it was more of a ritual than a casual bath. A set of previously invisible runes suddenly radiating on the washbasin suggested that it was a regular occurrence. </p><p>The risk of getting caught was considerable, and the consequences were hard to imagine. It wasn’t impossible for her to try to take me down to hide her secret, which she had gone a long way to keeping hidden. Still, a part of me missed that. After all, ironically enough, hiding in a corner and watching as a woman that was much stronger than me, with a mistake enough to bring all crashing down. </p><p>Unsurprisingly, a certain part of my anatomy joined the game with great enthusiasm as I watched her finish infusing the water with her light magic before grabbing a tankard and used it to wash her body, her hand dancing on her body, and the water pooled around her feet before evaporating with a flash of magic. For a moment, I focused on the magical implications, because while the water was visually clean, from a mana perspective, it was dirtied with darkness and shadows. </p><p>It didn’t take long to realize it was the aura of darkness that filled her room and surrounded the tower. It was clearly having dangerous side effects on her if it managed to infuse her body to such a degree. Which brought up the most important question again. Who the hell she was hiding from?</p><p>However, as she turned a bit and her breasts came into view again —large, firm, and tipped with rosy red nipples, this time being caressed by her soft hands as they were covered with a thin layer of shimmering water— my attention was fully commanded by them, and the question momentarily faded into the background. A fireball could have exploded in front of me and I would have paid it scant attention as I enjoyed the sight of their perfection. She was truly an angel, pure and perfect.</p><p>And very arousing. </p><p>Her hands continued to sweep over her breasts, lathering them with more and more magically infused water. With her every repeat, the trace amounts of darkness that infused into her body pulled away, enhancing her beauty even further. It was extremely erotic. </p><p>I wondered if she would caress her breasts with that tenderly if she knew she was being watched? When her hands moved south, caressing her stomach tenderly, it looked even more beautiful. Unfortunately, rather than playing with herself, she focused on cleaning herself tenderly yet calmly. </p><p>As a benefit, as she continued to caress her stomach, she turned toward me even more, displaying her beautiful breasts in full view. She leaned forward, creating an amazing cleavage while proving that her wings weren’t the only way she was defying gravity. </p><p>Then, things got even better as she focused on her legs. At first, I felt a bit disappointed that her movement made her turn her back toward me, as while her ass looked amazing, her full-frontal beauty was even more overwhelming. Then, she leaned forward, forcing me to adjust that view. Because as she bent forward, she displayed her ass in the best manner possible, making my shaft harden even more. </p><p>Unfortunately, I was too afraid of actually pulling my shaft out to get a handle of my arousal, and suffered the tightness in my pants instead. </p><p>Instead, I watched silently as she used her magic to slowly dry herself, bending forward for a few times more as she did so, enjoying the tenseness of her lovely legs, as well as the little, peek into her smooth core. My shaft got harder and harder as I watched, almost reaching to a torturous hardness, especially with a part of my instincts begging me to stain that purity. </p><p>Then, she started walking, this time toward the crystal. When she headmistress stepped onto the crystal and a white bright light covered her body, making it look like she was behind a sheet of rainy glass, obscuring the view —yet somehow making her even sexier in the process, her eyes closed. Then, she sat, her eyes closed, and her wings opened. </p><p>I finally had the opportunity to move, but instead, I continued to observe her. The aura that covered her body was too familiar. It gave the same tranquil sensation Titania’s little knot of light had been providing, just a thousand times stronger. If it wasn’t for the layers of wards around her office, it couldn’t have been felt from miles away by even the weakest mage. </p><p>Even more interestingly, it wasn’t the crystal that was radiating the aura, but the headmistress. Instead, just like how it impacted my mana by calming it down, as the time passed, it was suppressing the domineering aura inside her. Whatever was the source of the aura, the headmistress was clearly having trouble containing it. </p><p>Then, before I could even consider the implications of such a thing, I had an unexpected help identifying the source of the aura. </p><p>[Divine Spark Identified! Please absorb it to continue to support the operations of the System]</p><p>The identification of the source of the headmistress certainly added another complexion to the already-complicated situation…  </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 30    Experience: 447193 / 465000 </p><p>Strength: 41    Charisma: 53</p><p>Precision: 35    Perception: 37</p><p>Agility: 35     Manipulation: 40</p><p>Speed: 34       Intelligence: 44</p><p>Endurance: 34      Wisdom: 46</p><p>HP: 5370  / 5370\tMana: 6600  / 6600        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]    </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100]        </p><p>Master Subterfuge [97/100]     </p><p>Expert Speech [70/75]</p><p>Advanced Craft [50/50]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 21/25]</p><p>[Helga - Level 17/21]</p>",

    "content": "<p>Almost six hours after I had walked into the room, I had long collapsed on the bed next to Marianne’s sleeping figure —as Titania had left a couple of hours ago to measure the defensive efforts— trying to push back temptation to sleep next to her, exhausted by the constant exertion, though not the physical side. It was not to say that the physical side of it was not exhausting, but my stats were more than enough to compensate for the particulars. </p><p>However, the mental challenge constantly enhancing Marianne’s soul space and converting my mana into experience again and again for six hours. And the strain from constantly depleting and refreshing my mana reserves was not inconsiderable. </p><p>Pity that with everything going on, I didn’t have the time to enjoy some after-sex cuddling. </p><p>I had a feeling that, if I dared to do something like that with a lower endurance, I wouldn’t have walked out alive. Still, what a way to go.</p><p>After throwing one last glance at Marianne, deliciously naked except copious amount of cum covering her tits as well seeping out of her every orifice, still wearing a silly smile even as she slept, I pulled the covers on her and left the room. </p><p>Since I had already discussed a strategy with Titania —basically advising her to act like she over-exhausted her mana while staying in a warded location to prevent ambushes— I didn’t waste much time in the town. I just walked around once to check the unique chaotic resonance the mysterious organization was using to create artificial monster hordes. Luckily, there didn’t seem to be any, suggesting that, at least for the short term, they had reached the end of their little bag of tricks. Then, I conjured another trusty fake elemental steed, and left the town through the same tunnel I had created earlier. </p><p>[-1163 Mana]</p><p>As I traveled back to Silver Spires, enjoying the wind on my face while I considered the next steps. </p><p>The discovery of an organization of mysterious assassins just hours ago put a rather unwelcome twist to the challenge I was facing. First of all, it suggested that I was not the only one with the ability to manipulate the leveling system, but remembering the disgusting sight of their soul spaces, it was clear that they had a wildly different technique than mine. Whether it was the limit of their abilities, or I was facing just the tip of the iceberg, I didn’t know. </p><p>But I had a feeling that I would learn. </p><p>However, their inclusion meant I needed a develop a better strategy to protect myself than just handling whatever they were throwing at me. </p><p>The simplest thing to do that would be to talk to the headmistress about the plot, including the existence of the mysterious organization to see whether she would prepare any insights about them. Considering that she was a crone that had been alive for centuries, her knowledge did seem likely. They were targeting Titania, who was one of her loyal supporters until I sunk my hooks into her —well, I did sink something into her, repeatedly, which was decidedly more effective than hooks— which meant there shouldn’t be an alliance between the mysterious organization and the headmistress. As a bonus, openly talking with her would increase the defensive effectiveness of the school quite a bit. </p><p>Unfortunately, there was one very small problem with that plan. I didn’t trust her. </p><p>Admittedly, I wasn’t the most trusting person. Not that I had the luxury to extend my trust easily considering the challenges I had been facing, the potential worth of my unique system, not to mention the potential shady activities every single organization, official and illegal alike, might do to take someone that could actually manipulate the leveling system. </p><p>My distrust toward the headmistress was on another level. </p><p>First of all, for someone that managed the most important educational facility of the Empire, she was shockingly unknown, more of a scary ghost that perched on top of Silver Spires rather than an actual educator. And meeting with her directly didn’t help any. Her mysterious ability to limit the effectiveness of the system was very scary, and the way she dressed didn’t make her any more trustworthy. </p><p>Pity that I still had to collaborate with her to some degree. </p><p>I started to consider it a dangerous idea. “I need more data,” I murmured even as I turned my gaze toward the spires of the school, shining silver from a distance. I needed to know more about her before I could make a decision. What she really looked like? How did she act when alone? What was her objective? Why was she hiding in Silver Spires without taking any action for centuries? </p><p>Something resembling a smile crossed my lips as I considered the best way to do so. It had been a while since I sneaked around when being caught meant mortal danger. It was hard to feel the same exhilaration lately, because the worst thing that would happen was to waste a bit more time to get what I wanted more directly. </p><p>Sneaking into the personal tower of the headmistress was the opposite. Sneaking in through those expertly crafted magical defenses was hard enough, and the fact she lived in a self-enforced solitude meant that there was no convenient servant I could disguise myself to create an easy way to sneak in. </p><p>More importantly, getting caught had scary consequences, and just to make things better, I had no idea what those consequences would be. I didn’t know how strong she was —though considering she had to use Titania as a regent, I had to hope that there were some limits to it. However, even if that assumption was correct, she clearly had a range of mysterious abilities, as implied by her ability to empower Titania and hamper my connection with the system just by walking in her room. </p><p>When I arrived at the school, I met with a total cacophony, squads of students leaving the school, led by the faculty members, while the others returned with obvious signs of battle damage, their highly varying numbers and haunted expressions implying casualties. </p><p>The strategy to weaken the school through the monster hordes was clearly ramping up. </p><p>However, I didn’t choose to leave Silver Spires to hunt the hordes, because the number of students and faculty members that were preparing the leave the school was suspicious, as if almost someone was trying to leave the school defenseless. Considering the number of mana gems in the possession of the necromancers had to have a limit, it made sense from their perspective to launch all of them together to deplete the reserves before launching a final assault. Not to mention it was questionable whatever process they had to employ to trigger monster hordes had no other cost. </p><p>Of course, I might be completely wrong and they might be just using that to badger all those squads under endless monster hordes before easily marching against the school, but I doubted that. If they had that capability, why would they bother to actually gather a huge undead army? </p><p>The commencement of the attack would have given me an excellent opportunity to sneak into the headmistress’ room. Unfortunately, I actually had to talk to her before the attack commenced. The involvement of an organization that could send three people over level thirty to a mission together wasn’t an entity I wanted to ignore, even at the cost of violating the headmistress privacy despite potential violent consequences. Hopefully, she would be out, discussing some war matters with the rest of the faculty. </p><p>For my disguise, I chose a boring gray cloak with a hood, just enough to hide my identity without giving a clue about my affiliations. I doubted that it would be too effective if I got caught, but it at least soothed me mentally. </p><p>My real method to keep myself concealed was a complicated arcana array around myself, blocking any hint of presence. It wasn’t a mana-intensive spell, but the same way juggling a dozen knives was not a strength-intensive task. It was a complicated mana structure that needed to be maintained and shuffled at all times to catch any scrap mana I radiated. It was only possible through my finally completed Master Arcana skill, and even then, barely. </p><p>[-45 Mana]</p><p>I could feel sweat dripping down my face as I stood at the entrance of her tunnel, shuffling my own personal ward to prevent any kind of mana or life energy from radiating out as I tangled with the defensive wards of the entrance. It took me twenty minutes even to bypass the outer wards, and another ten minutes to take the first step on the imposing stairs. I climbed them slowly as I constantly used little slivers of mana to assess the ward structure, taking the most challenging walk of my life. </p><p>Then, I arrived at her office, only to hear people talking from the other side. Apparently, she was actually having a meeting, quite an important one considering no one had walked in or out while I studied the wards. </p><p>Luckily, her office wasn’t the only place I could enter using the stairs. One floor up, I could see another door, probably to her living quarters. I took a deep breath as I carefully climbed upward, afraid of what to find in her personal quarters. </p><p>When I opened the door, however, I met with a sight even more shocking than I had expected. Not because it was the scariest thing I had ever seen, but because it might have been the poorest personal quarter. </p><p>The room itself was quite large, however, other than a weird crystal in the middle of the room, and a huge shelf filled with books, I could easily convince myself that I walked into the servants’ quarter. The bed was small and uncomfortable looking, there was a long pole with five hangers, one empty, the other four with dark colored misshapen cloaks, just like the one that she had been wearing during our meeting. Though, despite their misshapen nature, their inner lining was covered with an impressive number of runes, some familiar, some utterly foreign, suggesting they were not simple utilitarian garments.</p><p>There was no bed, but just a cot was thrown in. Other than that, there was a small desk in front of the shelf along with a chair, both looking supremely uncomfortable. On a corner, there was a small pitcher of water and a washbasin. The floor was bare stone, absent of any kind of carpeting. </p><p> Even my room when I was the mule was supremely better than this horrible prison place. </p><p>My attention turned into the crystal in the middle. Essentially, it was a platform, about a foot in height and four heights in diameter. It looked like a solid diamond, which was a ridiculous contrast to the poorness of the rest of the room.</p><p>The crystal was perfectly circular, and its surface, other than an impressive number of rune carvings that I no idea what it meant. However, they were written in the same script I had found in the book I had acquired from Titania’s library when I started scouting her. Ultimately, the crystal was the main suspect for limiting my contact with the System. </p><p>Pity that I had forgotten to check about Helga’s progress on that, or even bother to question Titania about it. </p><p>The shelf was equally impressive. Like everything else in the room, it was crafted horribly, but the number of leather-covered books, actively radiating mana stronger than most magic items, which I didn’t think was possible. However, since their names on their spines were written on the same confusing script, I decided to examine the crystal first. </p><p>I walked closer, and touched it with my mana … and suddenly, my mana calmed. The difference was like a calm lake and a typhoon. I had no doubt that, if I cast a spell-like this, the effects would be much more precise than I ever thought possible.  </p><p>My mind flew through the possibilities, sharper than I ever thought possible. With every passing second, I was reaching a new understanding of magic regardless of the topic. My perception of the different topics started to merge…</p><p>It was a beautiful moment of enlightenment, so much that I felt very annoyed when the annoying click of the door distracted me from my musings. </p><p>Then, I remembered where I actually was! “Fuck,” I murmured as I did the only thing I could do. I dashed toward the only thing I could hide behind, the bookshelf, even as I cast a weird spell that perfectly merged the concepts of air element and arcana simultaneously, creating an illusion to hide me from the sight. It granted me near-perfect invisibility as long as I didn’t move. </p><p>Ironically, casting such an intricate spell was only possible due to the extreme calmness of my mana, given to me by the same item that caused me to be caught in my current circumstances. I watched with no little amount of trepidation as the hunched figure of the headmistress walked toward the middle of the room, my heart beating like crazy. </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 30    Experience: 447193 / 465000 </p><p>Strength: 41    Charisma: 53</p><p>Precision: 35    Perception: 37</p><p>Agility: 35     Manipulation: 40</p><p>Speed: 34       Intelligence: 44</p><p>Endurance: 34      Wisdom: 46</p><p>HP: 5370  / 5370\tMana: 1394  / 6600        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]    </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100]        </p><p>Master Subterfuge [97/100]     </p><p>Expert Speech [70/75]</p><p>Advanced Craft [50/50]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 21/25]</p><p>[Helga - Level 17/21]</p>",

    "content": "<p>As I watched Aria walked closer carefully, trying not to spill the tea, her every step riding her short black negligee up to reveal her absolute lack of underwear, I finally made my mind about how to progress. Since she had already shown such a beautiful initiative to look sexy, I decided to let her take the lead for a while. </p><p>“Thank you, sweetheart,” I said even as I leaned forward and grabbed the tea, using the proximity to place a gentle kiss on her lips. Wearing that sexy nightie was already given her a nice full-body blush, but the intensity was nothing compared to the one that blossomed when our lips touched. </p><p>“It’s nothing compared to the delicious breakfast you prepared for me,” she whispered even as she leaned and put the tray on the bedside table —and treating me with the amazing sight of her hips as her nightie rode upward— before she took her own cup, and sat next to me in her bed, but with a foot of distance between our bodies. </p><p>Silence stretched as we drank our teas in a surprisingly domestic scene. I focused on enjoying the high-quality tea, acting like I hadn’t noticed as Aria slowly scooted closer whenever I closed my eyes. Her shyness, overwhelming even when she was daring enough to change into such a sexy piece, made her much cuter. </p><p>In a sexy way, of course. </p><p>I consumed my tea slowly to give her the chance to break through her shyness and take action. With every sip, she slid closer. First, our arms touched, then pressed against each other. She was restless, playing with her hair and shuffling in her place alternatingly. However, despite her slow pace, her leg was firmly pressing against mine as I took the last sip from the tea. </p><p>“The tea was delicious-” I started, only to be interrupted in a shocking manner. My words were cut short by a pair of hot lips, carrying the taste of honeyed tea, pressing much stronger than I had been expecting. As much as I wanted to slip my tongue to get a more direct taste of that delicious aroma, I kept myself back. It was Aria’s time to shine. </p><p>And shine, she did. </p><p>She didn’t waste any time before she climbed on my lap, with only my pants to limit contact thanks to her noticeable absence of underwear. Her lips danced bravely, and soon, her hips joined to our little game, rocking back and forth. I wanted to pull her tight against my chest, to see whether her delicate nightie could survive the sudden pressure. </p><p>Luckily, while I battled with that desire, she had acted. Her fingers latched on my shirt, unbuttoning it with a surprising aggressiveness. It seemed that, with her initial reticence gone, she was going to be much more active than I expected. </p><p>Not that I complained. As I put my hand on the small of her back gently, her soft finger was already caressing my naked chest after pulling open my shirt. Luckily, with her lips still firmly against mine, I hadn’t needed to consider the relative merits of silence versus trying to encourage her further. </p><p>Not that it seemed to be necessary. She was doing an amazing job. I hadn’t even needed to pull her closer, because she put her whole weight behind the movement as she moved forward, her breasts pressing tightly against the broadness of my chest, her silk nightie too thin to reduce the impact in any way. And she continued to grind against me, making me get bigger and harder. </p><p>As her hips picked up speed, I couldn’t help but let my hands allow more adventure. One of my hands moved gently down her back, caressing the small of her back before resting on her ass outside her nightie. She said nothing, but continued rocking against my crotch. I decided to stay limited to there. </p><p>Unfortunately, my hands seemed to have a different idea, and went too far. They slipped under the already high hem of her nightie, cupping her naked ass. Luckily, that didn’t trigger her shyness, but instead, she started to move even more, her every move electric. </p><p>Lost in the moment, she barely registered as my hand moved up, caressing her waist before arriving at the underside of her breast, caressing tantalizingly. My move naturally pushed her nightie up as well, slowly converting her near-nakedness into total-nakedness. </p><p>She pulled back from the kiss, letting out a sharp breath in the process. However, before I could even properly consider whether I pushed too much, her fingers hooked around my pants, pulling them down with an aggressiveness that surprised both of us. </p><p>I was so turned on. </p><p>Her move pulled her delicious breasts away from my hands, but luckily, that didn’t really matter when she suddenly grabbed the front of her nightie and tugged, the soft silk failing to resist even for a fleeting moment before parting with a soft whisper, leaving her naked breasts to my view. </p><p>Just like that, she slid back on my lap, trapping my length between her thighs, her wetness covering the topside of my length. She leaned forward, but with another important change. This time, rather than silencing me with her lips, she chose to use her delicious bosom. </p><p>Being buried in the amazing expanse of her soft tits, especially when I was enjoying the softness of her bed, was not too much different from being in heaven. I displayed my eagerness as my lips closed around her engorged nipple, sucking and biting for a while before starting to kiss their wide expanse. </p><p>They tasted amazing, and the fact that her hips didn’t even stagger during their delicious grind made it much tastier. As I alternated between soft kisses and naughty bites to mark the borders of her treasure, she moaned helplessly. She looked extremely sexy as she threw her head back, moaning repeatedly. And the fact that she was still wearing the scraps of her nightie made it even sexier than she would have been if she had been naked. </p><p>After a lengthy delay, she moved, once again initiating a kiss as tits once again pressed against my chest, this time without the barrier of her nightie. Meanwhile, I cupped her ass once again, helping her as she moved back and forth on my lap. Technically, my determination was to avoid taking initiative and letting her do whatever she wanted, but my fingers rebelled once again, finding her wet entrance to tease her knob, only for her tongue to go wild in my mouth. </p><p>Luckily, she just leaned against my fingers, allowing my thick fingers to slip inside her, adding another source of pleasure to our extended foreplay. It was hard to believe that she was just a shy virgin just a few days ago… </p><p>I pushed my finger deeper and deeper, and it didn’t take long before I added a second one to my surprise assault, something that was greatly appreciated by her. She sped up in response, paying back my efforts with delicious pleasure. </p><p>Then, without saying anything, she moved back, leaving both my lips and my fingers idle. I caught her gaze with a questioning expression, only for her to smile shyly. However, I didn’t feel concerned, because it wasn’t her usual shy smile. It failed to hide the arousal bubbling underneath. </p><p>“It looks painful,” she murmured. It was clearly an excuse to touch my shaft, but with her soft fingers wrapped around my shaft to massage, I wasn’t in a position to care about her overreliance on excuses. Her fingers moved, starting from the base and started climbing upward. However, that didn’t stop her from leaning forward. </p><p>Her lips landed on the crown of my shaft as a gentle kiss before leaving a trailing lick on the side. As she did so, her naked tits pressed against my thighs, creating a spectacular sight. Then, things got even better as she engulfed the head in a wet, sloppy kiss, while her hands continued to work on the base. </p><p>Her tongue joined the fray as she swallowed the first couple of inches of my length as she continuously massaged the base. Her hands stroked my length repeatedly, twisting and stroking up and down, showing a spectacular instinct to give pleasure. My hips buckled as the pleasure hit. </p><p>I let my hands fall on her shoulders before traveling down, caressing the sides of her breasts to pay back for her selfless service. I didn’t hold her head to push her down, but it turned out to be unnecessary. Her mouth parted wide as her movement range extended, swallowing half of my length without the slightest hesitation. </p><p>She was truly learning. </p><p>As she continued, I bit my lips, trying to suppress my instincts to grab her head and skewer her aggressively. She earned that much with her enthusiasm, no matter how much her slow play frustrated me. I felt like a king, enjoying the service of my concubine before going to my throne… Well, considering I was being serviced by the crown princess of the Empire, it wasn’t a completely inaccurate impression. </p><p>It was even more pronounced when considering who had been taking that particular role the last night.</p><p>I just leaned back, enjoying the softness of the pillows as my smoking hot little blonde Princess lay on top of me, wearing nothing but scraps of sexy black sleepwear, her every erotic spot on display, sucking me like a true champion. </p><p>She moved deeper and deeper, her muffled moans mixing with mine as her grip tightened around my thighs, trying to use them as leverage. With every repeat, she was getting quicker and quicker, with the occasional gag or wheeze not even slowing her down. </p><p>She was hungry for the explosion… </p><p>Her nose started to caress my skin when I finally felt the familiar signs of an explosion. I could have kept it contained, but after she worked so hard for it without prompting, I decided to reward her. </p><p>My climax triggered, and suddenly, there was a huge rush of liquid traveling across my length before exploding in her mouth before traveling down her throat. She did her best to swallow it, licking the occasional drop that slipped from her lips. </p><p>She withdrew only after making sure that she had got every last drop. She didn’t bother to stand up, just slid upward and snuggled into my lap, her body softer than any blanket. I wrapped her with my muscular arms as she let her head rest on my chest, creating another sickeningly-sweet domestic scene as we tried to catch our breath… </p><p>I wasn’t exactly idle at this point, gently caressing her back, but occasionally slipping to massage her tits, their perfection as fascinating as usual. She started kissing my neck before sliding down to my chest, drawing the silhouette of my muscles with the ghosts of her kisses. </p><p>All that needed was to decide what to do next… </p>",

    "content": "<p>When I left the gladiator school, Pico was accompanying me, along with eight bodyguards who looked far too tense for it to be just a routine escort. If I were to guess, they had other gladiators who had suffered ambushes under similar conditions, which, admittedly, was a smart decision. Not only did they hurt another gladiator, but also they damaged the relationship between the school and the patrician houses. </p><p>A smart decision all around. </p><p>However, with a full squad of bodyguards around me, nothing happened. Not that it was surprising. There were many senators that walked around with a smaller team of bodyguards. </p><p>It took almost half an hour for us to arrive at the villa of House Servilia —while Pico continued to explain acceptable behavior code again and again— because, like many Patrician houses and other rich people, their main residence was a distance away from the actual city, allowing them to establish villas with a lavishness that would have been impossible in the actual borders of the city. As we finally arrived at the villa, however, I noticed the other reason for establishing their residences outside of Rome.</p><p>The wards of Pomerium were strong, stronger than anything else I had ever felt. However, they had one huge flaw from the perspective of a patrician family. They were designed for public access, meaning they restricted everyone equally. However, the wards of private residence were under their total control. </p><p>I closed my eyes, examining the wards while Pico talked with the guards, explaining the situation before they returned to the school. As my consciousness seeped deeper into the outer layer of the wards, only to meet with many structures I didn’t even recognize let alone decipher. With that, I got even happier about my infiltration strategy. The wards established by the richest and the strongest of the Republic for more than a thousand years seemed to be a hard target to crack. </p><p>Luckily, as I walked through the official entrance, the outer wards parted, allowing me to effortlessly bypass the strongest part of the defenses. Unfortunately, I didn’t have a lot of time to waste, because as I walked through the entrance, an upbeat melody reached to my ears, marking a celebration. </p><p>The servants led me toward the inner courtyard. I tightened my back, raised my head, and walked forward with a stony expression, doing my best to radiate the aura of a noble barbarian. I even cheated a bit, tapping into the wilder side of my magic, radiating a domineering aura. It was a subtle trick I had developed after studying my encounter with the disaster class wolf that almost killed me back in the mountain. It was using a similar aura to dominate the other wolves. </p><p>It wasn’t completely undetectable. Another sorcerer or a mage specialized in detection could identify the aura, but only if they were consciously looking for it. </p><p>And I doubted anyone would check a random gladiator for sorcerer-level magical talent. </p><p>When I finally stepped into the inner courtyard, the crowd fell silent as they examined me, giving me a chance to examine them in turn. Technically, it wasn’t a big crowd if one discounted the presence of the servants and the bodyguards. Among the constantly moving crowd of servants, there were about a dozen noblemen and noblewomen lounging on reclined chairs, enjoying wine and peeled fruits. </p><p>Most of them were unfamiliar, some I recognized from the arena. However, a pair of them were more memorable. One of them was the man that was glaring at me angrily as I left the arena —well, a man if I’m being charitable, but calling him a boy was more appropriate. Not because of his biological age, as he was probably a couple of years older than me, but it wasn’t the age that elevated boys to men, but stature. </p><p>And the frustrated anger as he glared at me disqualified him from being called a man. He was clearly unhappy about my presence here, but he was unable to say anything, owing to the expression on the other familiar face, the redhead that had been sitting next to him during the game, watching me like I was a particularly tasty piece of meat. </p><p>And the seating arrangement suggested that she was the lady of the house, and the boy was her guest. It explained why I had been invited despite his apparent distaste. </p><p>However, one interesting detail caught my eye. Both the food and the number of servants suggested a lot of money, even in the standards of Rome, but the furniture, despite its quality, looked old enough to start frying on the edges. It was well maintained, but still suggested some not-so-recent financial difficulties. The contrast with the current lavish spending was rather interesting. </p><p>I focused on the moment. I stood straight, letting my aura radiate stronger for a moment, amusing myself with their reaction. The men —and the boys— stiffened in fear, their instincts screaming that they were in the same room with a bigger predator. Meanwhile, the reaction of the women was more nuanced, with widened irises and quickened breathing. </p><p>“And the hero of the day is finally here,” called the redheaded girl as she slowly stood up, reacting faster than the rest of the group. As she stood up, her green dress slipped enough to excite any man around as she moved, but without actually causing a revealing accident. It was no doubt carefully tailored by expert tailors to give that exact effect, enhancing her femininity as much as possible without causing a crisis. </p><p>And she had a lot of femininity to enhance, I noted in appreciation as she walked forward. I didn’t bother to hide the hungry arousal in my gaze as she sauntered toward me. On the contrary, I deliberately enhanced the display as I let my gaze caress her lithe body that was nonetheless crowned by a pair of delicious tits, just large enough to fill my palms to perfection. </p><p>She noticed that gaze, but that only made her prouder. I had no illusions about the source of it though, I was just a showpiece, a circus act valuable only because of my unique celebrity status. </p><p>“Finally, the hero of the hour, heroic Dacian, the slayer of Chimera, is here,” she said with a soft voice with perfect cadence. Then she turned to her angry friend and continued. “So, Marcellus, what do you think about our guest,” she said with a wide smirk. “Do you still think you can take him down?” </p><p>“Of course I can, Olivia,” Marcellus answered, but only after a pause. Meanwhile, I was more interested in the obvious tension between them. When Olivia looked at him dismissively, he continued hurriedly. “What can a barbarian with a spear do against my magic.” </p><p>From the way Olivia smirked, her attitude was clear. Just by mentioning magic, our angry boy had lost the argument. There was clearly a story behind their antagonistic closeness, but not one I really cared about. I only cared about the impact. </p><p>“If you say so,” Olivia murmured mockingly before shifting her gaze toward me, her eyes brightening as she did so. “Take a seat,” she said flirtatiously in a rather exaggerated manner. I took a seat, sitting straight, letting just a touch of carefully calculated anger slip into the surface to remind them that I was a barely tamed barbarian. After all, I was selling a story for these spoiled noble children. </p><p>One of the girls scooted closer, who, based on the quality of her dress and the seating position of her group, clearly belonged to the lower echelon of the group. She likely belonged to an Equites family, and using the event as a social-climbing opportunity.</p><p>“So, Peirous,” she quipped. “Do you have any interesting stories to tell us?” </p><p>I sent her a sharp glare, staying in intimidating range before turning into a smothering look, one that made her shiver in arousal. Still, she was too unimportant for me to actually try to intimidate or seduce, so I decided to fulfill her request. I took a hard bite from a large piece of meat rather than using a knife to cut a smaller piece to support my barbarian aura, before I started telling a modified version of my battle against the Dragon Serpent, but replacing it with a weaker creature while erasing all the signs of using magic. </p><p>I could have acted like a moronic warrior and told the story in a boring way, but that wouldn’t have helped me too much. After all, more than being known as a gladiator, I wanted to be a regular as entertainer. So, I used my oratory abilities to the limit. It wasn’t actually something too suspicious, because nomadic tribes, regardless of the location, had a strong oral tradition. Being a skilled storyteller wouldn’t actually hurt my chances. </p><p>I still kept my word selection as simple as possible of course, occasionally stopping to remember the correct word —which ‘coincidentally’ overlapped with the natural tension points of the story, making it even more excited as they waited for my words. The girl who asked me the question put her hand on my forearm carefully while doing her best to look like it was an accidental touch, flirting rather aggressively. </p><p>It was a bit unseemly, but not too much. After all, unlike the surrounding cities, Rome was surprisingly open when it came to female decision-making when it came to sex. </p><p>As I told the story, the center of the group slowly shifted as everyone started to listen to me carefully. I wasn’t the best storyteller in the world, but unlike most storytellers, I wasn’t just repeating the stuff I had learned from others, but telling my own experiences, adding a layer of reality they could never match. I even showed them some wounds from my earlier fights —one that I had to recreate before I entered the gladiator school because of my body’s annoying tendency to cure those wounds. </p><p>While the story continued, the girl scuttled even closer. I put my hand on her thigh impudently, smirking smugly when one of the boys looked angrily. My smugness was not faked, though most came from amusement. After all, it wasn’t the first time I was a part of the noble group. I had been forced to spend time with many of my ‘noble peers’ back when I was in Britannia. </p><p>Amusingly, the crowd that surrounded me belonged to a higher class, so much that even the girl I was currently caressing, who was at the bottom of the hierarchy, would have been the guest of honor if she ever decided to visit my old school, making the headmaster stand next to her like an overeager servant. On the contrary, I was not a bastard noble with questionable birth, but a slave. </p><p>Ironically, I could act much more impudently than I ever did despite the huge gulf. Or maybe, it was the hugeness of the gulf that allowed me to act in such a forward manner. After all, from their perspective, despite all my strength, I was just an amusing piece of decor but nothing more. </p><p>Too bad for them that this piece of decor had a piece of explosive hidden inside. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I had been considering whether Marianne had actually forgotten my presence as I closed in the distance. I received the answer when I spanked her ass, only for her to flinch in surprise. Apparently, Titania’s pussy was enchanting enough to make her forget my presence. </p><p>That earned a small punishment for her. </p><p>“Don’t stop,” I said even as I climbed on the bed, and pushed my fingers through her gloriously golden hair, keeping her pinned up to her task. Since it wasn’t exactly a chore for Marianne, she continued her task with the same enthusiasm after a small break. </p><p>Titania looked at me, her expression reminding me of a cute bunny caught in a trap. I couldn’t help but chuckle at her shocked expression. “Is there anything you want to say?” I said. </p><p>“No, nothing,” she answered rapidly before avoiding my gaze even as she crossed her arms over her chest, trying to make the situation less revealing. Well, technically she succeeded, but in the same vein, chipping a couple of cubes from a huge iceberg would make it smaller. </p><p>Still, Titania was lucky that I needed to deal with Marianne first. Not only her oiled ass was still pointing upward, waiting for my attention, but also I needed to help her level up more. “So lovely,” I murmured in appreciation as I used my empty hand to caress her ass while the other stayed firmly between her blonde locks, enjoying the sensation as her soft flesh swallowed my touch. “So big and soft, yet so shapely. You’re a treasure, honey,” I murmured in appreciation.</p><p>She had an amazing ass, almost rivaling her beautiful tits. </p><p>Marianne murmured an answer, though considering I was pushing her head against Titania’s crotch, only an indecipherable murmur reached my ears. Still, the sight of her nether lips getting wetter gave me all the answers I needed. Apparently, receiving open compliments was able to trigger a deeper level of arousal even with everything that was going on. I noted that as a happy discovery before starting to act aggressively.  </p><p>Still, I savored the softness of her ass for a while before moved to the next step. When I aligned my shaft against her wet entrance, she gasped softly, but that was nothing compared to one that she let out when I suddenly shifted my target and pressed against her puckered hole. </p><p>“Yes,” she moaned in appreciation, this time barely audible even with the sexy barrier that silenced her, showing the effects of our extended anal relationship. Her ass quivered in anticipation, showing just how much she had missed my thick girth in her ass. </p><p>I just chuckled, not bothering to comment. After all the times we had been together, her anal fascination was barely a surprise. I prepared myself to cast a spell to clean her entrance, but to my pleasant surprise, Marianne was faster, flaring her magic to cast a healing spell, both lubricating and cleaning at the same time. </p><p>She was getting very proficient in conjuring sex-related organic material, I noted with amusement. </p><p>“Excellent initiative,” I said as I leaned in, slipping the head of my shaft into her puckered hole, earning a sharp gasp in response. I didn’t push forward immediately, letting her getting used to my presence, but I didn’t exactly waste my time. I used the opportunity to transfer some mana into her, using some to bequeath her some experience, and the rest to reinforce her soul space, therefore increasing her level cap. </p><p>[-1639 Mana] </p><p>Despite her loud moan, she continued to lick Titania’s sopping entrance. Titania bit her lips, her eyes closed, her arms crossed over her chest, desperate to keep her moans inside, like doing so would have convinced me that she was just an accidental party to our threesome and not enjoying it even more than I was. Not surprising, considering I was still pushing Marianne’s face against her entrance to make her provide an amazing oral service. </p><p>Since one of my hands was empty, I decided to reward Marianne with that. I first caressed her ass gently, surprising her with the sudden intimacy, then shifting into a sharp spank that exploded on her ass, making it jiggle attractively. The muffled cry she let out was a thing of beauty. </p><p>Then, her kiss quickened further as one of my hands slid down over her ass and arrived at the treasure between her legs, caressing softly. I could have teased her, but considering the impressive effort she was displaying despite the intimidating presence of Titania—well, at least in the beginning, as the shortish brunette under Marianne, moaning helplessly under the assault of her tongue wasn’t exactly the most authoritative presence possible. </p><p>I pushed my fingers deep into her entrance aggressively, drenching them with her wetness even as I slowly pushed my hips forward, forcing her tight hole to widen slowly. As a side effect, her assault on Titania’s crotch intensified even further, making her let out a  delicious string of moans. </p><p>Even as my fingers quickened, I didn’t neglect to push my hips forward steadily, making her ass swallow an ever-increasing portion of my shaft, with rather great results. And Marianne channeled that passion to her tongue, until Titania suddenly let out a loud moan, once again trembling in a familiar manner, signaling yet another orgasm. </p><p>“She’s still getting used to it,” I said as I loosened my grip on Marianne’s head, finally allowing her to stop licking Titania’s wetness. Still, Marianne only pulled after another minute, clearly enjoying the way Titania was gushing. </p><p>“It’s obvious,” Marianne said after she pulled back, smirking at the trembling figure of Titania, no doubt replacing the supposed impenetrable pillar in her mind with a horny yet hesitant cutie with an extra-sensitive body. “I guess-” she tried to continue, but I interrupted her with a sudden push, making her moan. Partially because I didn’t want her to say something to anger Titania, but mostly because I wanted her to focus on solely me. </p><p>The warm-up was over, and the real thing about to begin. </p><p>I could have pulled her to the couch to let Titania recover while I dealt with Marianne. It would have been a nice thing to do. Instead, I pushed her on top of Titania, their tits pressing against each other, creating an uneven yet spectacular view. Marianne sent me a smug look, proud of her curves, but that didn’t last long, immediately replaced by a pained gasp as I pushed deeper inside. </p><p>“Damn, girl. You’re tight,” I gasped as I watched her plump ass hide my considerable length with nothing more than an occasional gasp, proving her amazing ability. Things got even better as she threw her head back and let out a delicious cry before she pushed her hips, quickening her delicious magic trick. </p><p>I couldn’t help but watch transfixed as she slowly devoured my length, an involuntary gasp escaping the confines of my mouth as I watched the wondrous sight. Her back arched as she managed to swallow my whole length, putting all pressure on Titania. Luckily, Titania might be on the shorter side, but her supernatural strength meant the weight on top of her was nothing more than a horny blanket. </p><p>I pushed forth aggressively, enjoying Marianne’s uncontrollable shivers while Titania slowly realized what was going on on top of her, her eyes widening in shock as I broke yet another milestone for her with Marianne’s assistance. </p><p>She was jaw-droppingly marvelous, a state that was only enhanced as her hips started gyrating as I moved back and forth, like she was delivering a dance show. It was a good show, but it could get better. </p><p>I caught Titania’s eyes, which were busy radiating a shocked expression. “She’s a bit loud. Why don’t you silence her?” I asked, only to receive a stupefied look. I sighed. Normally, Titania was one of the smartest people I had ever met, but after three orgasms back to back, especially without her emotional dampener, it was getting difficult for her to process innuendo quickly. </p><p>Or maybe, she was just feeling hesitant to take initiative. </p><p>Regardless of the reason, I had no problems explaining myself further. “With your lips, sweetheart,” I said. A brand new blush covered her body as she processed my order, but the final result was never in doubt. She just leaned forward and captured Marianne’s lips, initiating a hesitant kiss. </p><p>That sight only made me pump more aggressively, enjoying Marianne’s tightness. Meanwhile, each slam made her body shake, making her tits dangle beautifully. I used the opportunity to flood her body with more mana, even as I grabbed her hips tightly, stabilizing her before I intensified my assault even further. </p><p>[-2391 Mana]</p><p> She just moaned repeatedly —which were successfully muffled thanks to Titania’s shy kiss— uncaring of the liberties my hands were taking. Though, admittedly, compared to everything else, what my hands were up to didn’t really register on the scale of naughtiness. Even when my fingers slipped into her wetness, pumping furiously once more, her moans only intensified marginally. </p><p>Still, the sight of her sharing a kiss with Titania while their tits pressed together was an amazing sight… </p><p>Just like that, several minutes passed as we fell into a beautiful monotony, with me pumping her with a hypnotic rhythm while their tongues battled with a slowly increasing intensity. Marianne’s back arched occasionally as the pleasure flooded her body, while I continued to stay behind her, happy with my entrenched position. </p><p>Titania’s face carried the occasional hints of confusion, like she was trying to understand how things had devolved into a pit of depravity, but never longer than a fleeting moment. A caress of Marianne’s tongue or a slip of my fingers were always more than enough to pull her out of such pointless pondering, and after each distraction, the distraction between her ponderings extended further. </p><p>What we shared was pure, unadulterated fucking… </p><p>“For all that’s holy, fuck me harder!” Marianne cried the moment Titania left them unattended, her earlier controlling attitude long shattered under the pleasure brought by my aggressive impaling. </p><p>“As you wish, sweetie,” I said as I spanked her ass, and increased my speed even further, reacting to a pace that would have triggered a heart attack in a lesser man. She grunted as she suffered under my renewed assault —for a very special value of suffering— before I pulled out and ordered. “On your back, bitch, I want to see your slutty face as I cum.” </p><p>The sudden change in the nicknames didn’t stop her even for a second as she rolled, laying next to Titania, who was too shocked to adapt to the sudden change, her lips slapping each other like she was still searching for the delicious presence of Marianne’s lips. </p><p>Marianne parted her legs, creating an amazing sight as she did so. I slipped into her gaping hole while I pulled her hips toward me, the new angle allowing me to stretch her asshole even further. Her back arched, her amazing tits pointing toward the ceiling, vigorous enough to resist the call of gravity even from her current position. Instead, they swayed like ocean waves with every slam.</p><p>I couldn’t help but grunt in appreciation as I felt her legs wrapping around my waist, wordlessly asking me to fill her. I was a hero, meaning I could never reject the kind request of a damsel. With a loud grunt, I exploded, filling her bowels with both my seed and my mana. </p><p>[-4825 Mana]</p><p>[Mana regeneration perk activated. Count 4. Duration, 8 hours]</p><p>I only pulled out after making sure I had dumped every last drop into her. Meanwhile, I could feel my mana reserves refreshing even faster with the assistance of my refreshed perk, the courtesy of my curvy blonde beauty. </p><p>With that additional bonus, I decided to skip rest. Instead, I pulled out, cast a convenient spell to clean my shaft and get rid of my sweat at the same time before sliding half a step on the side, essentially recreating the earlier position with two major differences. First, the beauty under me was thin and brunette instead of blonde and curvy. Second, I was pressing against her wet core rather than her backdoor. </p><p>“I hope you’re ready for the second round,” I said with a charming smile before sliding into her, enjoying the way her earth-shattering moan slammed to my ear, just like I slammed into her…</p><p>Seconds turned into minutes, which gathered a crowd big enough to create hours as I helped Marianne to level up and Titania to recover… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 30    Experience: 447193 / 465000 </p><p>Strength: 41    Charisma: 53</p><p>Precision: 35    Perception: 37</p><p>Agility: 35     Manipulation: 40</p><p>Speed: 34       Intelligence: 44</p><p>Endurance: 34      Wisdom: 46</p><p>HP: 5370  / 5370\tMana: 1394  / 6600        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]    </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100]        </p><p>Master Subterfuge [97/100]     </p><p>Expert Speech [70/75]</p><p>Advanced Craft [50/50]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 21/25]</p><p>[Helga - Level 17/21]</p>",

    "content": "<p>“So, Titania,” I said lazily as I crossed my legs and caught Titania’s eyes, who was split between looking at the door like she wanted to escape the room despite her very noticeable nakedness and hiding under the covers, hoping that pulling the covers on her would somehow make her invisible. “You seem a little tense? Is there a reason for it?” </p><p>“T-the battle was difficult,” she managed to stammer, her shyness making her even cuter. In moments like that, it was hard to remember she was actually strong enough to eviscerate the whole town if given a reason. “Not the mention these mysterious hunters. It’s stressful.” </p><p>“Of course,” I nodded in understanding, but she shivered upon seeing my smile. Understandable, considering that my smile implied a lot of stuff, with every single one of them ending in with her collapsing into a quivering mess of sweat and ecstasy. “Actually, it’s my fault. I should have considered the impact of this horrible ordeal on you. You need to relax. Maybe I should let you rest.” </p><p>Her sudden panic suggested that despite her earlier panic, she was very much against me leaving this quickly. Luckily for her, I had no intention to do so even temporarily. I gestured to Marianne. “Marianne, sweetie, why don’t you help the most important pillar of our school to relax through a massage. She deserves a little pampering after the amazing achievement of defeating two monster hordes in a row perfectly.” </p><p>Marianne showed her cute obedience and nodded even as she jumped up to her feet —a move that had a spectacular impact on her curves, especially her delicious breasts. Her expression was calm, though it contrasted greatly with the shine behind her eyes. She was no less enthusiastic than me to properly help Titania get acclaimed with the real meaning of pleasure, it seemed. </p><p>Then, she pushed the envelope even more. The short walk between the couch and the bed extended into a short show that nonetheless felt like an eternity, every swing of her beautiful hips enough to inspire a poet for a lifetime. Every time her foot touched the floor, her body trembled lightly, starting from her legs until it reached her most attention-grabbing part, her oil-covered tits. </p><p>And if Titania’s shocked gaze was any indicator, I wasn’t the only one that was enjoying the sight. Though, unlike her, I didn’t have a growing panic as the said pair of tits got closer. “I-is this really necessary?” Titania stammered cutely, while Marianne took the last step and dwindled the distance between their naked bodies into nothing. “I can simply catch a short nap. It would be enough to feel refreshed. I don’t want to be a bother.” </p><p>“Nonsense,” I said, not waiting for Marianne to interject. Not that I needed to hurry, as she seemed to be perfectly happy as she perched on the edge of the bed, waiting for our talk to finish. “Marianne is a sweetheart, and she would enjoy helping you relax. Wouldn’t you, sweetie?” </p><p>“It’s a privilege,” Marianne answered while she smiled demurely —at least, demurely on the surface, as she wasn’t trying her hardest to hide her hungry smile. Though, her lack of effort was understandable. It didn’t matter how perfect her expression was, when her hands were already betraying her true thoughts by grabbing Titania’s blanket and pulling it off enthusiastically. Titania tried to hold her cover in place, but it slipped off her fingers. </p><p>“I don’t…” Titania murmured, but when our eyes met, her complaint, which was already lacking in conviction, faded into nothingness. The cover fell to the floor, and Marianne grabbed another fruit to prepare more massage oil. </p><p>“Lie down, and let Marianne show her amazing skills on your tense shoulders. And believe me when I say she has great skills. I taught her myself.” </p><p>That reminder broke through Marianne’s confidence, making her blush as she no doubt remembered the initial parts of our relationship, filled with delicious tricks that were enjoyable in a whole different way. Meanwhile, Titania was too busy trying to minimize her exposure as she lay on her back. She even telekinetically pulled a towel to cover her ass as she lay on her face, but Marianne just chuckled as she threw the towel. “We won’t need that,” she said with surprising confidence, taking Titania’s hesitation as a sign to exert her opportunity. </p><p>Luckily, she was smart enough to know her limits despite the extraordinary situation and didn’t let her pretty mouth spill any statement that could be construed as a taunt. Titania might be shy enough to act like a chambermaid who found herself in the wrong bedroom, but that didn’t change the fact that she had both the individual ability and the political position to make Marianne’s life a living hell if she wished so. </p><p>Marianne pressed her oil-covered hands gently, only for Titania to gasp. “Wow, you really need this massage,” Marianne commented offhandedly as she gave Titania’s shoulders a squeeze and tested her tenseness. </p><p>I leaned back on my seat as I waited for my mana to recover, determined to enjoy the show. With Marianne’s torso already glistening with a lot of oil and Titania’s body slowly getting drenched to catch up with her, it was a rather nice show, enough for me to enjoy until my mana recovered completely. </p><p>It started rather tame as Marianne gently rubbed Titania’s shoulders in circles, though after a few repeats, she decided to cover her fingers a respectable amount of mana to help her. Healing wasn’t my strongest forte, but it was easy to recognize the simple cantrip that healers used as a training tool, allowing them to manipulate the muscles. Seeing Marianne using that as a massage tool, my positive impressions got even stronger. She was really taking my half-hearted lesson about creativity to heart. </p><p>“How’s this?” she asked as her hands slid down, enjoying the wild expanse of Titania’s back freely as she worked the demolish the knots created by the siege they had suffered. </p><p>“Not … bad…” Titania managed to murmur before she closed her lips hastily, almost quick enough to successfully confine the moan that escaped its confines. </p><p>Almost, but not quite. </p><p>It was a familiar moan, one that Titania let out whenever we started our little games. Only at the start, though, because as the time progressed, her moans would lose their hesitance, and become more honest. Still, the sight of her pressing her legs desperately to hide her wetness was a delicious sight. </p><p>“Happy to hear,” Marianne murmured as she moved down, bypassing her ass to focus on her calves and thighs with the help of a generous slap of oil. Just like I expected, Titania’s voice started to lose its shy quality as Marianne’s fingers resolved the tenseness of her thighs. Instead, her voice was tainted with the familiar tone of arousal. </p><p>While I wasn’t surprised by the ultimate result, I was surprised by the speed she was folding under Marianne’s touch. Marianne was getting really skilled with her massage technique. </p><p>“How do you feel?” I asked after another cute moan escaped her mouth, barely thirty seconds after the first one. “Do you still think that the massage idea was a waste of time?” </p><p>“I feel - good!” she answered, her calm answer turning into a shocked cry as Marianne used the opportunity to caress her wet lips, using Titania’s distraction to a maximum benefit. With that cry, her already-poor attempts to hide her arousal fallen apart, leaving only naked arousal behind. </p><p>Titania tried to keep her legs pinned, but that proved to be unnecessary as Marianne didn’t spend any more time on that sensitive area after her gentle caress, instead of climbing up to focus on the small of her back, drawing large, rhythmic circles. </p><p>As Marianne continued to deliver her teasing massage, Titania wasn’t the only one that was getting frustrated under the insistent tickling of arousal. I was already sporting a full erection throbbing with enthusiasm as Titania moaned, and the sight of Marianne’s naked body, wiggling and jiggling invitingly whenever she made a sharp move didn’t hurt the sight any. </p><p>My eyebrows rose surprisingly when Marianne suddenly stood straight as she created another generous portion of oil, and this time, applied that on her body rather than drenching Titania’s body. I was surprised, not that I was unhappy watching as Marianne covered her whole body with a fresh coat of oil, this time applying that on her thighs as well. However, I wondered what she had in mind. </p><p>Luckily, I hadn’t needed to wait for long as Marianne climbed on the bed —and displaying her large ass spectacularly as she did so— and trapped Titania’s body between the bed and her amazing tits. Titania gasped in shock, but Marianne didn’t care as she moved up and down. It was a justified response. If Titania had any complaints about Marianne’s touch, she should have complained when we started. Or at least, she should have said something while I was playing with Marianne. </p><p>Admittedly, after a brief gasp of shock, Titania’s purrs of satisfaction mixed with Marianne, showing that she was too relaxed thanks to massage even deliver a fake complaint. </p><p>Those purrs were quick to transform into moans of pleasure under Marianne’s repeated actions, her hips rocking reflexively under Marianne’s attention, inviting a penetrating presence. Unfortunately for her, I found the show they were putting too spectacular to cut short. I decided to let Marianne play until my mana reserves were replenished. </p><p>Still, the desire to bury my face between her thick thighs was hard to suppress. Luckily, Marianne was distracted by Titania’s intensifying moans to pay attention to me. I doubted that I could have maintained my determination to stay away if she turned her beautiful blue eyes on me, begging for my touch… </p><p>Titania said nothing, but the way her legs parted wider and wider as she abandoned her feeble attempts to ignore the sexuality of her experience. That addition made the desire to reject the call even harder. </p><p>Then, Marianne proved her enthusiasm as she suddenly pulled back, only to flip Titania. “W-what-” Titania stammered, which was cut short as her face was buried in the amazing expanse of Marianne’s tits. A shocking yet interesting move. It didn’t last long, but even after Marianne moved, because her tits were replaced by her lips, silencing her with a searing kiss. </p><p>After a slight hesitation, Titania started kissing, adding enthusiastic moans to the mix, especially after Marianne’s hand slipped low and found the treasure between her legs. Her fingers disappeared through Titania’s entrance as their tongues fought against each other, creating an erotic sight. </p><p>Soon, Titania’s hands joined the fray, her fingers disappearing into Marianne’s generous bosom, much to Marianne’s appreciation. And Marianne wasn’t the only one happy about the sudden initiative Titania was showing. My heartbeat picked up speed as their dance turned into an oily wrestling match, spreading the glistening liquid even more. </p><p>“Amazing,” I whispered to myself, too soft to pull the girls out of their distraction. Understandable, considering Marianne had dedicated her full attention to make Titania squirm, and Titania was busy with moaning with an ever-increasing loudness. She accepted Marianne’s assault passively, enjoying the string of kisses Marianne had left on her body. </p><p>Then, I decided to check my status. </p><p>[ Mana: 5421 / 6600 ]</p><p>With a sigh, I stood up. I had been enjoying watching the show, and I would have loved to watch them until Titania got used to her new reality and start retaliating, but unfortunately, I was being pushed by some external concerns. Still, since my mana hadn’t recovered completely, there was no harm in walking slowly, enjoying the show for a little while more. </p><p>As I closed in, Marianne’s hands were exploring Titania’s body aggressively. However, that was just a distraction to hide her general downward movement. Titania kept her eyes closed, moaning repetitively even as Marianne journeyed through her stomach, leaving a kiss for every step. </p><p>She only realized what was going on when Marianne’s breath fell on her wet core. Even then, she was far too gone to say anything but a simple word. “Please,” she whispered, her need for a release overwhelming her tone. </p><p>Marianne was far too excited to ignore Titania’s heartfelt request and pushed her head between her thighs, her tongue already out to caress her puffed lips. Titania moaned loudly, while Marianne’s tongue delved into her core. And just to make things better, her oil-covered bottom rose up invitingly, almost intentional, though I could see that Marianne was far too distracted by Titania’s delicious taste to remember my presence. </p><p>Luckily for her, I was more than ready to remind her of my presence… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 30    Experience: 447193 / 465000 </p><p>Strength: 41    Charisma: 53</p><p>Precision: 35    Perception: 37</p><p>Agility: 35     Manipulation: 40</p><p>Speed: 34       Intelligence: 44</p><p>Endurance: 34      Wisdom: 46</p><p>HP: 5370  / 5370\tMana: 5583  / 6600        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]    </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100]        </p><p>Master Subterfuge [97/100]     </p><p>Expert Speech [70/75]</p><p>Advanced Craft [50/50]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 21/25]</p><p>[Helga - Level 17/21]</p>",

    "content": "<p>Impaling Titania until she climaxed while I prepared to caress the naked curves of Marianne was a spectacular feeling, but one particular fact made that moment much better. </p><p>It was just a short preview of the amazing break I had prepared.</p><p>While the sudden appearance of a dangerous mysterious organization who managed to create such formidable warriors and mages through an unknown method —not to mention a surprisingly strong reserve of knowledge considering their amazing spells— had forced me to adjust my time plan yet again, it actually forced me to stay here longer than I planned. I wanted Titania to be safe, and the best way to achieve that was to strengthen Marianne as much as possible. </p><p>Not that I was unhappy with the process, of course. </p><p>Based on my delicious experiments with Cornelia, I already knew that I could only help to push them to the edge of level twenty, which was my limit based on my level, which required a scary amount of mana from me. Luckily, before visiting Marianne, I had visited Aviada, which activated the third instance of my mana regeneration perk. After a quick romp with Marianne, I would have four instances of it active, which would cut down the required time considerably. </p><p>And with the mana I needed to spend on Marianne, the amount required to top up Titania was negligible. Though, just because her presence wasn’t necessary didn’t mean that I would kick her out. Tasting her brunette beauty was always a fun activity. </p><p>Unfortunately, despite her immense reputation, Titania was temporarily out of the game, collapsing against my chest listlessly after her spectacular climax. She might be an expert in facing hardship and resisting pain, but the same clearly didn’t apply when it came to pleasure. </p><p>“Someone is a bit exhausted,” I said with a chuckle even as I gently lay her on the bed, enjoying her murmur which was filled with shy acknowledgment. I turned to Marianne —after propping up Titania so that she would have a direct view of the show without straining herself— and said, “It seems that you need to take up the slack for a while. Do you think you can handle it?” I asked. </p><p>Despite her naked state, or the fact that she had been playing with Titania moments ago, Marianne was too shy to answer such a question. She just stood there, suddenly aware of her nakedness, blushing cutely. I couldn’t help but chuckle, which helped her to gather her courage. “I can,” she managed to whisper even as she blushed.</p><p>“Excellent,” I said even as I took a seat on the couch, making sure to pick the position that would provide Titania with the best view possible. Then, I curled my finger, calling Marianne closer. </p><p>The silent order worked much better than the question earlier. Her blush remained, but her body was invigorated as she walked closer, her plump hips dancing with each step like a barmaid trying to earn a fat tip from the adventurer with a full wallet. </p><p>Well, she definitely wanted a fat something. </p><p>Once she arrived at the front of the couch, she didn’t try sitting. Instead, she fell on her knees without the slightest prompting, her blue eyes shining with enthusiasm as she looked at my cock, still glistening with Titania’s juices. “I know, it’s a bit dirty. Why don’t you help me clean it?” </p><p>“As you wish,” she murmured, but despite what her words might imply, her tone lacked even the slightest hint of hesitation. For her, it might as well be a delicious meal after long fasting. </p><p>In her defense, it had been a while since I was able to pay her a proper visit, and even then, she had to share attention with Cornelia. She leaned down, her tongue darting out with enthusiasm as she gave a slow, lingering lick to the side of my shaft, while I enjoyed the way her huge tits negated the call of the gravity no matter the angle or the position. </p><p>I groaned in pleasure, though the sensation created by her tongue wasn’t the only reason —though it was amazing. No, her enthusiasm to lower herself in front of me in a way a servant might feel degraded to follow without the slightest hesitation, instead of replacing with enjoyment, was the clear response. </p><p>Maybe it was the impressive power I had displayed, maybe it was the benefits I had offered, or maybe the impressive achievement of breaking Cornelia’s pride without breaking her, an achievement Marianne was very aware of its difficulty. Regardless of the reason, however, I was more than ready to enjoy the fruits of my own achievement. </p><p>And what a naughty fruit it was. She enthusiastically licked every single bit of my shaft, moaning in appreciation as she did so like she was gobbling a gourmet meal. And as she did so, her fat tits pressed against my thighs, which was another delicious experience. </p><p>It was a beautiful sight, but after a while, I raised my head to check the condition of the other beauty in the room, only to see her looking at the scene with a shocked expression. Her eyes widened even further when our eyes met, but then she flattened her expression, trying to act like she wasn’t enthusiastically watching the show that was going in front of her. </p><p>I had to admit, her noble and uncaring expression was a thing of beauty. I might have even believed it, if it wasn’t for her carelessly parted legs. Or more accurately, what her carelessly parted legs revealed. I sent her a mocking smile before letting my eyes drop down pointedly, enjoying the sight of her glistening arousal. </p><p>She said nothing, but by shamefully pulling the cover on herself and burying her face between her hands, she answered my question much better than anything she could actually say. I turned my attention back to Marianne, giving Titania space to calm down and get used to her new reality. </p><p>My appreciation for Marianne enhanced further when she pulled back to grab a nearby fruit, only to use her healing spells in a surprisingly flexible manner to convert the organic matter into massage oil, all while still staying on her knees. It wasn’t a perfect transformation. Not only it happened very slowly, but it was also wasteful in terms of mana. </p><p>However, it was not something she could have done with her healing abilities. </p><p>“Someone is studying hard,” I said in appreciation even as I put my hands on her naked shoulders, caressing gently. My words were not just precautionary words of congratulations. I was impressed because she had shown an improvement I hadn’t been expecting in mimicking the wider abilities of Biomancy, all because I had coached her through a very different application of life energy. She wasn’t very skillful in using such an ability, but that wasn’t important. </p><p>The important part was she challenged her limits in a different way without my prompting. Such creativity was a pleasant surprise for me. </p><p>“It’s just a little trick,” she murmured shyly as she raised her hand, showing the massage oil she had created shyly. </p><p>“It might be a little trick, but you came up with it by pushing your limits. It’s much more important than yet another ability given by your skills or taught by me,” I corrected her thinking. Then, I smirked naughtily. “However, we can talk about your magical studies later. Now, why don’t you show me what you have in mind with that pocket of oil? Should I lie down?”  </p><p>“No need,” she whispered shyly even as she raised her hands, but she surprised me by using the oil she prepared on her breasts rather than applying it on my body. Though, when she put her hands on the sides of her breasts and hovered above my crotch, I understood what she was going for. </p><p>Understood and approved… </p><p>“An excellent show of initiative,” I said in appreciation as she wrapped her tits around my shaft. “You’re learning.” </p><p>She moaned at my words, either ignoring or accepting the hidden implications that positioned her as a servant. Admittedly, it was not a bad deal. Her family wasn’t especially eye-catching among the noble families, essentially serving other families. I didn’t doubt that I could take down every single combatant her family could field alone —without even receiving a wound if I could arrange the battlefield beforehand. For her, being my servant was a much better deal than taking control of her own family. </p><p>Especially since even if I failed to recover from my setback, I could easily level up to level twenty by bequeathing experience, and even help her level up further by the boring way by increasing her level limit and hunting together. </p><p>I neither knew nor cared whether she considered those details before submitting to me wholeheartedly, because I was far too interested in the way her tits stretched to cover my cock with the hot massage oil she had conjured, a moan of appreciation escaping my lips. </p><p>And apparently, her acceptance of her new role was also helping her to discover the truth about herself, because there was no sign of hesitancy in her movements as she leaned forward, drowning my shaft between her soft tits, moving up and down, her every move earning a soft gasp from me. </p><p>I didn’t stay idle as I received the massage. After throwing another glance at Titania —who was watching the proceedings with an enthusiasm she tried to keep hidden only to fail spectacularly— I turned my attention on the sexy blonde that was doing her best to suffocate my cock the best way possible, and let my hand fall on her shoulder. </p><p>She gasped beautifully, but didn’t disobey as my hand slid into her soft hair and pulled her lips closer to my shaft once more. She didn’t waste even a second before capturing my shaft between her lips obediently, her head bobbing back and forth as she tried to take me as deep as possible while keeping her tits on the base of my shaft, not depriving me of the gentle caress of her slippery, oil-covered breasts. </p><p>Still, just because her lips were restricted to a limited area didn’t mean that Marianne couldn’t deliver an amazing performance. Her tongue danced aggressively in her mouth, assisting her lips to a great degree. Her moans of enjoyment, making my shaft rumble beautifully, didn’t hurt my pleasure as well. </p><p>After her earlier display, her submissive tendencies weren’t surprising, though that didn’t mean they weren’t pleasurable. I was already a good distance into my climax after the short yet intense play with Titania. And with Marianne treating my shaft like a newfound treasure, I consumed the rest of the distance rather quickly. </p><p>I checked Titania once again, but this time, I did so through a fleeting glare without alerting her at my gaze, only to find her watching the show with a mesmerized expression. Her body was still covered with the blanket, but it wasn’t enough to hide the suspicious movement underneath from my glare. </p><p>Even with the cover, it was obvious that her legs were parted, and the subtle movement of her shoulder left no doubt about what her fingers were currently busy with. Surprisingly, as I grabbed Marianne’s hair and pushed my shaft deeper into her throat in the preparation of a climax, Titania’s excitement intensified further than I had expected. </p><p>Delicious little detail, I noted before I turned my full attention to Marianne. I could have pulled Titania’s covers magically, forcing her to face her own naughtiness, but why bother, when I could do so in a much more involved manner after she properly recovered from the previous time. </p><p>Marianne continued her task enthusiastically, uncaring of the little show that was going behind her. She gasped and gagged and heaved, but that didn’t prevent her from swallowing the full length of my shaft. </p><p>“Excellent work, sweetie,” I said even as I let my hand slip down to her oil-covered breasts, squeezing and grasping to my heart’s content. It was an amazing sensation, one that I easily lost myself in for several minutes, while she continued to work on my shaft. </p><p>She let out occasional moans and whimpers, which were conveniently suppressed by my shaft lodged in her mouth. I continued to caress her body, reaching toward her stomach before climbing back and working on her shoulders, effectively covering her torso with massage oil even as I worked on her. As the time progressed, her moans were getting more and more enthusiastic. </p><p>However, the first climax came from an unexpected source. Titania, who was temporarily abandoned to give her time to recover, exploded in a sudden moan, surprising both of us. I even let Marianne pull back to look while I examined Titania, who was blushing furiously as she trembled with the aftershocks of her self-inflicted climax, doing her best to bury herself into the bed, clearly hoping to be invisible. </p><p>Marianne was about to say something, but I put my finger to her lips to silence her, not wanting to take the risk of her saying something that would tick Titania. I didn’t want her to feel a grudge, which would be easy to resolve after my inevitable leaving. “Sorry honey. I was waiting for you to recover, and you clearly did. Give me a minute to reward Marianne for her amazing massage.” </p><p>With that, I grabbed her head and pulled her once more, but this time, fucking her mouth furiously. Marianne’s moans of appreciation showed that she was clearly enjoying the aggressive treatment. </p><p>I was already primed, and with the help of Titania’s surprise show, it didn’t take long for me to explode into Marianne’s mouth, my seed accompanied by a spectacular gush of mana. </p><p>[-4258 Mana] </p><p>Her eyes widened as she did her best to swallow the deluge I created, surprisingly managing to swallow all of it without wasting any. Which was well, as every drop was drenched in mana, allowing her to take a huge leap toward her new level. I gave her a moment to catch her breath before speaking. “So, are you ready to attend our glorious head librarian, my dear little Marianne?” </p><p>Her enthusiastic smile was truly a beautiful sight… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 30    Experience: 447193 / 465000 </p><p>Strength: 41    Charisma: 53</p><p>Precision: 35    Perception: 37</p><p>Agility: 35     Manipulation: 40</p><p>Speed: 34       Intelligence: 44</p><p>Endurance: 34      Wisdom: 46</p><p>HP: 5370  / 5370\tMana: 2315  / 6600        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]    </p><p>Master Arcana [100/100]        </p><p>Master Subterfuge [97/100]     </p><p>Expert Speech [70/75]</p><p>Advanced Craft [50/50]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 21/25]</p><p>[Helga - Level 17/21]</p>",

    "content": "<p>Three days after the close call that happened in the living room, where Nancy almost caught me in a very compromising position, where I was banging her stepmother Nicole, and instead caught me in just a normal compromising position, where she thought I was banging a nameless brunette model who was slutty enough to get naked in the living room of a stranger. Pity that she was giving me the cold shoulder since that encounter. I would have liked to test the limits of her fury. </p><p>The anger of redheads was truly a sight to behold when they were naked and writhing in pleasure under me. </p><p>However, currently, my frustration was less about Nancy’s attitude, and more about the latest e-mail I had received from the client, about the outdoor shooting I had completed with Penny despite great personal exhaustion. Well, the exhaustion was less about the shooting itself and more about the extracurriculars we had spent together, but that was just a small, unimportant detail. </p><p>The important thing was the client was trying to delay the payment using some of the more obscure business lines. </p><p>I wasn’t really afraid that I wouldn’t receive a payment, because one of the bigger benefits of working together with some of the biggest names in the sector as an intern was that I had learned quite a bit about how to set up an iron-clad contract as a freelancer. One of the subclauses guaranteed that in case of a quality dispute, the national photographer guild would arbitrage based on the job description and the final product, instead of trying to deal with collection agencies or small claims court. I wasn’t even afraid that my previous dispute with the editor who was angry about my dalliance with his family members, because blacklisting someone was something, but defending a client against a photographer would anger his team to a degree that wasn’t worth it.  </p><p>Of course, that didn’t mean a legal dispute was the best way to handle such a thing, because doing so would not only make sure I would never receive repeat work from the same client, but also significantly damage my reputation in the town. </p><p>I was just starting to make money in this little boring town. It was too early to move. </p><p>However, the main reason for my frustration wasn’t even that. No, I was annoyed because the client had strongly implied in his email that dinner with the full team where he discussed his opinions about the photos might resolve his issues. And I had been in the sector long enough to know what that was a code for. </p><p>He wanted me to arrange a date between him and Penny, preferably in a hotel room. Admittedly, it wasn’t an outrageous request considering sector standard. It wasn’t rare for the model to spend some intimate time with the client decision-makers for the bigger contracts. </p><p>Unfortunately for him, Penny was mine, and I didn’t share. </p><p>Of course, that left one big problem. Even if I could resolve the current issue I was facing without any damage, I would inevitably face the same question again. If I wanted to create a path to my success, I couldn’t use the third-tier talents who were willing to work for the limited budget I had — not to mention none of the decent talents would work for me even if I had the money, afraid of being blacklisted alongside me. </p><p>The next time a client asked me to arrange a dinner with Penny, or God forbid, even Nicole or Katie, I might not be in a position to reject without sacrificing my already wobbly career. And I was too selfish to ever share them with a bunch of clients. </p><p>“Fucking no,” I murmured as I stood up, frustrated. I needed to find a way to make money that was under my control, and I needed to do so soon. </p><p>Luckily, I had a busy week, completing a number of projects decent-paying projects, giving me a little egg-nest I could spend for a project as long as I could keep the costs below five figures and launch it reasonably early. The bad thing, I had nothing else than a little money, a camera, and a blacklist that prevented me from using most of the common resources available for someone with my network.</p><p>With my mind busy trying to come up with a fresh idea, I was distracted as I climbed up the basement stairs. Only to be pulled out of my thoughts by a knock on the door, just as I was about to open it. </p><p>I opened the door, expecting either Katie or Nicole to visit. Much to my surprise, I faced neither a bubbly blonde nor a shy brunette. Instead, I came across a redhead, who looked frustrated at my almost instantaneous presence at the door. </p><p>“Can I help you, sweetheart?” I asked even as I took note of the way she dressed. Unfortunately, it seemed that our latest encounter seemed to push her in a different direction, because she was wearing a boring pair of sweatpants, and a loose t-shirt without a single redeeming quality. </p><p>“Don’t call me sweetheart,” Nancy answered immediately, latching on the opportunity to be angry at me. Considering our last encounter, it wasn’t a particularly difficult frame of mind for her to reach. All that she needed to tap into the fury that created by my outrageous display of fucking a ‘stranger’ in the middle of her living room, no doubt assisted by her fallacious feelings of being betrayed. </p><p>“As you wish, honey,” I said, the unrepentant smile on my face telling her that I was more than willing to cycle through cute pet names if she wanted to defend that particular point. </p><p>Her beautiful green eyes flashed in anger, but after an inaudible grumble that no doubt included a couple of insults toward me, she decided to let it go. Understandable, as she knew how shameless I could be when confronted, and she knew that from a very vivid first-person experience. “I can’t deal with that right now,” she murmured. “I need a favor.” </p><p>“Oh, really?” I said softly.</p><p>“Yes, you owe me one for not telling Nicole about your perversion, and I’m calling the favor.” </p><p>For a moment, I was tempted to call her bluff, curious how Nicole would react when confronted by Nancy complaining about the whorish brunette model in the living room, but decided against it. It had the potential to be fun, but it carried an equal risk of Nicole collapsing in worry. The entertainment value was not worth the risk. </p><p>Instead, I decided to tease her in a different way. “Which one you’re talking about, the brunette one, or the redhead one?” I said, my grin widening into a smirk. </p><p>It took a moment for her to realize what I was referring, which stalled her for a moment. “Shut up,” she murmured. “Are you going to help me, or not?” </p><p>“Tell me what you want first. As a principle, I don’t agree to open-ended requests.” </p><p>That statement didn’t help her anger any, but my serious expression was sufficient to dissuade her from that point. “It’s something easy for you. I just need to borrow your camera for half a day tomorrow.” </p><p>“No way,” I answered immediately. “Honey, that’s my lifeblood. I can’t afford to have it repaired in case of an accident, or I wouldn’t have been living in the basement of a stranger,” I answered. </p><p>“I promise I’ll be careful,” she answered. </p><p>“Out of the question,” I countered. “That camera is too important for my job to risk. But if you really need it, I can recommend you a place to rent one. You should have enough money for deposit after the payment for your modeling.” </p><p>She suddenly blushed. “I … can’t,” she said. </p><p>“Why, did you already paid back the published for the advance you have received?” I said, expecting her to nod. </p><p>Instead, she shook her head. “No, I spent it already,” she murmured, her eyes already falling on the floor. </p><p>“Interesting strategy,” I said with a chuckle, then waited for her to answer. </p><p>“I hadn’t wasted it,” she lashed out defensively. “I invested it for my book.” </p><p>I raised my arms in defense. “Hey, I’m not your parent. I don’t care whether you invested your money or blew all it on while partying. However, I still won’t lend you my camera.” </p><p>“Please, just for half a day,” she repeated. </p><p>“No,” I said with a sigh, while her expression fell. She turned and took a step away. “Why do you need my camera in the first place?” </p><p>“We need to take photos of our booth during the convention,” she murmured as she walked away. </p><p>“What convention?” I asked. </p><p>“I rented a booth in a big fantasy convention to market my book,” she said. “A tailor friend of mine prepared costumes for some of the characters. I even arranged for two cosplayers to wear them. I was hoping to snap a few pictures to use them on online marketing.” </p><p>“Why didn’t you say so?” I said with a sigh.</p><p>She turned to me immediately. “You’ll lend me the camera?” she asked excitedly. </p><p>“Definitely not. I’ll never give my camera to someone else, especially to be ” I said, and her expression once again shifted to anger, thinking I was playing with her. “I’ll do something better. I’ll drop by the convention and take the photos myself.” </p><p>“Really?” she asked. “We need to drive almost three hours to get to the convention center. We need to leave at six, and it’ll take your whole day. You would do that for me?” </p><p>I smirked. “Well, that depends.” </p><p>She was smart enough to feel alerted at my words. “Depends on what?” </p><p>“Whether you’re willing to pay back with a favor of your own, of course.” </p><p>“What do you want,” she asked hesitantly. </p><p>“I don’t know yet,” I answered. “But probably, I’ll ask you to model for me again. It shouldn’t really be a problem after the last time, is it?” </p><p>“Modeling…” she murmured, blushing as she remembered how that particular chapter ended. </p><p>“Yes, just modeling,” I said with a smirk. “The rest is a bonus we might do if you beg for it, of course,” I said with a chuckle. </p><p>“When hell freezes over,” she answered immediately, lashing out.</p><p>I chuckled. “If you say so, sweetie. Let’s go.” </p><p>“Go where?” she asked. </p><p>“To your room, of course,” I said, waiting until her anger flared once again. “I need to check the costumes to make sure everything is in order.” </p><p>“Do you think that’s really necessary?” she asked. </p><p>“Without a doubt,” I answered. “Sweetie, I’m a fashion photographer, I need to check the stuff beforehand to make sure everything is in order,” I said even as I started walking toward the stairs, forcing her to follow me. Actually, I didn’t really need to see the costume, because I knew that unless the costumes were a total disaster, I could take some decent photos using good angles and lighting. And if they were horrible, nothing I could do today could recover them. </p><p>However, I wouldn’t miss the opportunity to finally visit Nancy’s room, especially if I could use the opportunity to make her wear the costumes. And if things went well, maybe even remove them myself… </p><p>“There’s no need, my friend is a professional, and I trust her to prepare them perfectly,” Nancy cut in. Unfortunately, she seemed to be getting smarter in terms of putting herself in compromising positions. “We can meet in the living room, tomorrow at six.” </p><p>“Whatever you wish, sweetie,” I said with a dismissive shrug. It was a bit of a bummer to lose the opportunity to have a little redheaded fun, but considering we would be spending a whole day together tomorrow, it wasn’t exactly an unbearable setback. </p><p>Instead, I walked to the kitchen to make myself a tea before walking back to my room, determined to find an independent way of making money… </p>",

    "content": "<p>I was feeling rather exhausted after watching Queen Sapphire walk away after our interesting negotiation. Luckily, she was as exhausted as I was, which made it very unlikely for her to check my cell. So, I stayed in the private room for a long nap, enjoying the forgotten feeling of sleeping on a bed rather than the hard stone floor of my cell. </p><p>Unfortunately, I didn’t dare to ignore the sunrise, and left the room early after a quick breakfast rather than lazing around, a luxury I sorely missed, and slipped back to the secret tunnel that connected the club to the palace, intent on returning to my cell. </p><p>That intention didn’t survive for long, overwhelmed by the temptation as I passed in front of Aria’s room. </p><p>A simple flare of magic was enough to disarm the protective wards that isolated the crown princess’s room from the dangerous darkness of the secret tunnel, and I walked in. </p><p>Aria was sleeping on her bed, buried among the white covers, which had slipped just down enough to reveal her pale shoulder for my hungry gaze. She was beautiful and helpless, a sleeping beauty waiting for her prince to wake her up. Unfortunately, she didn’t get a prince, but a dark lord. </p><p>Though, her luck all wasn’t bad. I could have slipped in her bed to wake her up in an erotic manner, but that would have been rude of me. She was being such a nice sport accepting the change between us, so much that she deserved a reward. </p><p>So much that I decided to surprise her pleasantly. </p><p>I moved toward the rest of her private wing. Being the princess had perks, one being a dedicated room complex that was essentially a small house, including a dedicated, well-stocked kitchen to serve her private guests. Such rooms existed so that royal children could keep their political ploys concealed from any spy that might be hidden among the kitchen staff. </p><p>And for me, it gave me the chance to prepare a nice breakfast spread. </p><p>I started whistling softly as I grabbed a knife and a few ingredients, before starting to chop them in a manner that would make a professional chef jealous. It was partly about my combat skills bleeding, but it mostly came from the earlier days of my climb to the power, where I disguised myself as a chef to assassinate several of my opponents in one big feast.  </p><p>And now, I was using those skills to create a delicious breakfast for Aria. Though, I had to admit, as I whisked and chopped and fried, I felt oddly calm. It had been years since I had done anything that could be remotely classified as a domestic task, and it gave me a weird sense of accomplishment. </p><p>Admittedly, it might be more about the fact that I was cooking in the heart of the Empire rather than the act of simple cooking, but I decided not to waste too much time on that particular fact. </p><p>Half an hour later, I walked back to Aria’s bedroom, this time carrying a tray filled with a delicious smelling omelet,  freshly squeezed fruit juice, and a spread of other freshly prepared food. And since I was pushing it to a different point, I put a beautiful pink flower in the center to add a bit of color. </p><p>I woke Aria up with a gentle kiss to the lips. “Good morning, sleepyhead,” I murmured. </p><p>Her eyes fluttered open with a dazed smile, only for her gaze to widen when she realized it was me who woke her up. “B-Byron,” she stammered in shock as she got up. The covers slid down as she did so, revealing her misaligned nightie. It was a white piece, one that would have been conservative if it was fitting perfectly, but with a couple of buttons open and not properly fitting to her shoulders, it showed a tempting cleavage. </p><p>“It’s breakfast time,” I said with a smirk even as I raised the tray. “I hope you like fruit juice in the morning. Or would you prefer a cup of tea?”</p><p>“J-juice is fine,” she stammered, unable to erase the incredulous expression on her face. “Is this - is this all for me?”</p><p>“Nothing less than you deserve, sweetheart,” I said even as I caressed her cheek gently, adding a domestic quality to the moment. She blushed furiously under my touch. “I assumed you would be hungry after working hard yesterday.” </p><p>The remainder of the exhausting threesome we shared the earlier day didn’t help her blush any. “But how?” she stammered. “Did you ask a maid to cook?” Her panic was justified, as even if I managed to hide my identity, the fact that there was an unknown male in the princess’ room, asking for breakfast would have been excellent rumor mill material. More importantly, it might bring the fury of the Queen. </p><p>“Don’t worry, I cooked them myself,” I said with a smug smile. </p><p>“Made everything? You can cook?” she asked in shock. </p><p>“I’m a man of surprising depth,” I answered even as I placed the tray in front of her and sat next to her. Just to push the domestic angle further, I grabbed a piece of fruit and raised it for her to bite. She did so, using the chewing as an opportunity to think. Unfortunately, she wasn’t really good at dealing with surprises, and finding the scary dark lord next to her bed, feeding her breakfast was understandably surprising. </p><p>The silence stretched for a while as I hand-fed her, and she stayed on the bed obediently, being fed. As she got used to the shocking nature of the moment, however, her chewing got faster. Clearly, yesterday’s exertion helped her appetite quite a bit. She started fighting a growing smile, only to fail spectacularly, creating a stupidly adorable scene. </p><p>When I sat next to her, she leaned against my chest, enhancing the domestic quality of the scene. She fought off a smile, only to fail miserably as she enjoyed my cooking. She was so endearingly adorable, tempting me to push her down and use her bed the way it was destined to, having a repeat of yesterday's adventure in a more intense manner, but I kept myself back. I had worn her out plenty, so she needed the breakfast.</p><p>“So, it seems that you worked up quite an appetite, princess,” I said cheerfully as she took another bite. “You’re lucky that I’m here to help you burn that off to protect your delicious figure.” </p><p>She blushed prettily. “Help me burn off? How?” she asked. </p><p>“Really,” I said even as I let my arm around her waist tighten. “You don’t have an idea how I’m going to help you burn off?” </p><p>She tried to make eye contact, only to fail after the barest contact. “Maybe I do,” she whispered. </p><p>I said nothing, but helped her bite a piece of fruit, while simultaneously kissing her neck, making her shiver. After that, the silence stretched, while she enjoyed the double assault of the delicious taste of the food I prepared and my gentle caresses. </p><p>I outdid myself. </p><p>She nuzzled against my chest as the breakfast was about to finish. “It feels nice,” she whispered as she buried her face in the crook of my neck and rested her chin on my shoulder, taking a deep breath. Luckily, I smelled rather nice after the pampering I received in the club, affecting her even more. </p><p>Not wanting to destroy the domestic quality of the moment, I smiled and wrapped my arm around her while brushing my lips across her cheek. </p><p>She whispered something, which was too soft even for me to hear despite our closeness as she tilted her head. Then, without any prompting, she pressed her lips to mine, initiating a tender, lingering kiss.</p><p>The kiss lasted for a while before she pulled back, trying to act like nothing extraordinary had happened despite her furious blush. To deflect, she focused on her breakfast once more, attacking the remaining scraps with surprising enthusiasm, even as she leaned against me for full support.  </p><p>I toyed with her hair for a while before pushing it aside to run my lips over the back of her neck. She shivered helplessly as she continued to eat her breakfast. Meanwhile, I was getting more and more tempted to devour her. “So, are you getting full, or do you need any help?” I asked, and she shivered again. The fact that she could recognize the innuendo was a huge improvement compared to innocence before she fell into my not-so-tender mercies. </p><p>“So, do you have any plans for the day?” I asked. </p><p>“N-not particularly, no,” she stammered. </p><p>“Hmm, good to hear,” I whispered. “I can think of a few things to keep you busy for the day.” </p><p>She said nothing, but the fact that she let herself buried into my arms indicated that she might not be against the idea. She played with the cutlery distractedly as I kissed down her neck, letting my breath fall on her shoulder. </p><p>She giggled cutely, before her shyness dominated her once more and she fell silent. For a while, she maintained that silence before speaking. “What do you want to drink?” she asked as she suddenly pulled out of my arms as she was suddenly overwhelmed by the tenderness of the moment. </p><p>“I wouldn’t say no to a delicious cup of tea,” I said, giving her some time to recover from the tenderness of the moment. She left, taking the tray with her as well, and I lay on her bed, enjoying the comfort. The bed back in the private room was nice, but unsurprisingly, the quality was not comparable to the luxury in the royal quarters. </p><p>Aria disappeared for a longer time than I had expected. She walked back in fifteen minutes later, just as I was considering whether to follow her. Though, the sight I met was more than enough to compensate for her disappearance. Apparently, she had a change of clothing in the meanwhile. </p><p>She was still wearing a nightie, but unlike the previous functional long white nightie, she was wearing a black negligee, both too short and too thin to sleep in it comfortably. It didn’t display cleavage, but with her amazing breasts stretching the surface, the lack of cleavage didn’t hurt her sexiness in any way. </p><p>She avoided looking at me, keeping her eyes firmly on the tray she was carrying as she walked closer. The way her already short negligee rode up high enough to reveal her absolute lack of underwear awakened a rather urgent erection. </p><p>All that remained was, how to proceed. Sweet, aggressive, or even, a walk in the royal gardens… </p>",

    "content": "<p>After my victory, I walked toward the tunnel entrance I had used earlier, among the deafening cheers of the audience. I was especially interested in the gaze of the female part of the audience, of course, especially if they were sitting on the most distinguished part of the Colosseum. After all, the whole point was to use that as an opportunity to sneak into their libraries. </p><p>However, just as I was about to slip inside the tunnel, I felt a coldness on my neck, one that reminded the sensation whenever I faced a monster back in the mountain, though not necessarily one strong enough to threaten me. </p><p>I turned back, only to meet the eyes of a young man, probably in his early twenties, looking at me like angry eyes. It wasn’t the first time I met such eyes. I had the occasional noble boy looking at me like that when I humiliated them —a rare occasion due to the fact that I was trying to keep a low profile— silently promising that they would make me pay. I didn’t fear such overgrown idiots back then, and I didn’t fear him now. </p><p>There was a limit to what a puffed-up noble could do. </p><p>Even more ridiculous was the reason for his anger. A red-haired beauty was sitting next to him, looking at me with an undisguised aroused expression. Considering the enforced distance between them, I had a feeling that his angry look was highly related to the gaze she was sending to my way. So, I winked at her which made her blush, then I smirked in his way that silently conveyed I was better than him before leaving. </p><p>I felt my neck crawling even more strongly as I stepped into the darkness of the tunnel, but the intensity didn’t bring any more pressure. I was confident that I could handle whatever that man could bring. </p><p>However, my confidence didn’t maintain its unwavering state for long. </p><p>The change came as I walked deeper into the tunnel, only for my body to react differently. This time, it wasn’t a crawl on my neck, but a sudden quickening of my blood flow, followed by my muscles tensing, preparing me to fight, or even escape if necessary. </p><p>I was facing true danger. </p><p>It took a moment for me to notice a shadow in the corner, which, considering my senses, a scary achievement. “So, you’re a new talent that kid Antonius found. So lucky of him,” he said. </p><p>There was nothing threatening in his tone. He sounded like a kindly old man. And when he stepped out of the shadow, I got a better view of him. He was a man in his sixties or seventies, frail-looking, absent of any weapon. He wasn’t carrying any sort of weapon, nor did I felt any apparent magical pressure. </p><p>Still, my body continued to react the same way it did when I faced the pack of ethereal wolves. Not impossible to handle, but just a moment of oversight </p><p>Before I could answer, the familiar figure of Antonius walked forward. “I see that you’re enthusiastic about meeting my gladiators, Master Cato,” he said. His tone was mild, but the pressure I felt from was no less intimidating than the pressure generated by Master Cato. </p><p>“You know that I enjoy meeting with the new talents,” Cato said softly, threatening to explode. “In that vein, I heard about the accident your other gladiator suffered. Was that the third, or the fourth gladiator you lost this month to food poisoning? I hope this one survives.” </p><p>“Thank you for your concern, Master Cato, but Ludus Dacicus could handle itself.” </p><p>“Don’t be shy, boy. Your master is like a brother to me. Too bad that he’s still in a coma. How long it has been. Five years?” he said in a kind, grandfatherly voice. Well, technically grandfatherly, but only due to my own grandfather, who thought that a bunch of exercises designed for gladiators was the perfect way to train a seven-year-old. </p><p>“I’m sure that my master would like to visit you once he recovers,” Antonius answered. I had to admit, I respected his calmness. He managed to hide his anger except for the way he tightened his grip around his dagger. “Anyway, Master Cato. We need to leave for celebrations, if you don’t mind.” </p><p>“I don’t mind,” Cato said with a snicker. “I know how rare for your school to celebrate something. I shouldn’t interrupt that.” With that, he stepped into the shadows and disappeared from the view, his presence fading as well. A few seconds later, his presence disappeared completely. </p><p>“What a kind old man,” I said, not bothering to suppress my sarcasm. My joke fell on deaf ears, as Antonius walked forward, each step slamming hard, trying to suppress his anger. Unsuccessfully, I might add, as after taking a few steps, he stopped and started punching the wall, hard enough to crack his knuckles. The magically reinforced stones of the Colosseum, however, survived without the slightest crack.</p><p>I decided to stay silent as he tried to suppress his anger, though didn’t bother asking anything, mostly because I had enough problems to deal with without delving into plots of dangerous old men. I knew just how formidable they could be. Hopefully, I would be able to finish with the school before whatever disagreement they were having spread to me…</p><p>The moment we left the tunnel, four bodyguards surrounded us, their tenseness suggesting that my expectations might be too far on the optimistic side in terms of my expectations. Antonius said nothing until we arrived at the training area, only to give a generic celebratory speech, officially designating me as one of the gladiators of the school before fading into the background. </p><p>Admittedly, the rest of the celebration was fun, mostly because of the impressive spread of alcohol selection, accompanied by piles of roasted meat… It seemed that my unexpected victory brought much-needed levity to the rest of the gladiators, who were clearly aware of the sacrificial nature of my fight. </p><p>The celebration raged on, I noticed that with every refill, my drinks were getting more and more diluted, but despite that, my blood was flowing faster and faster. It wasn’t hard to recognize that my drinks were being spiked with aphrodisiac. </p><p>The reason for that was revealed by my trainer Pico as the celebration started to wind down. “You’re lucky boy, you’re going to visit the house of House Servilia.” </p><p>That put a smile on my face. House Servilia was one of the minor Patrician families, with limited political presence, but their history was one of the more decorated ones, meaning there was a high chance that their library would contain some interesting stuff. </p><p>I listened as Pico gave me a detailed breakdown on how to act, essentially telling me to lean on my barbarian identity, but with several lines not to cross. Apparently, noble ladies really liked an illusion of savagery of the gladiators, but only when it’s the illusion. </p><p>As Pico continued to explain, several servants carefully washed and dressed me, even using an impressive amount of perfume that reminded me of a forest. Apparently, the gladiator school was even more prepared for such occasions than I expected. </p><p>It was going to be an interesting visit… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Despite the nerdy hobbies of the girls, the lunch had been fun, so for the rest of the classes, I had a smile persistent smile on my face. Though, admittedly, that smile might be about the message I received from Carrie, telling me that she would visit my house after dinner. </p><p>Apparently, with her shyness beaten, she approached sex with the same enthusiasm she displayed for her classes. </p><p>I was feeling the anticipation as I went back home and gone through my exercise routine, only to read an interesting message on my phone after finishing my shower. Carrie was telling me that she was going to visit with a friend. It seemed that Sarah wanted to accompany her in a misguided attempt to help Carrie seduce me, unaware of her progress. To clench her objective, it seemed that Sarah even forced Carrie to bring her swimsuit along. </p><p>I couldn’t help but respect Sarah’s well-meaning determination as I changed into my swimming trunk and a t-shirt, which, unlike the loose stuff I wore for school, displayed my muscles to the best of effect. Carrie had an excellent body, so, seeing her in a swimsuit would have been enough to erase her nerdy image if I hadn’t already studied her body in great detail, without anything in the way to ruin the view. </p><p>Just as I finished leaving a couple of snack plates on the side of the pool to create a small party —minus any alcohol, as I tried not to take any in the first place, but also I didn’t want Sarah to have any mental clutch if I could manage to push the night the way I wanted to— when I heard a car pulling into my driveway.  </p><p>I went there to greet them, only to see Sarah leaving the passenger seat while whispering a number of quick recommendations for Carrie, unaware —or uncaring— that her pose was straining her short dress to the limit, displaying her toned thighs to the best effect. She might have a lithe body, lacking the curves Carrie sported, but seeing her legs naked, I concluded that that particular difference by no means hurt her overall sexiness. </p><p>“Hi, Chad,” Carrie waved after their quick discussion ended, sporting a smile that could be classified as smug when she noticed Sarah had frozen momentarily when she saw me wearing a tight t-shirt that displayed my muscles to the best of effect. </p><p>“Hi, girls,” I said, which pulled Sarah from her daze. </p><p>“Hi, Chad,” she said. “Sorry to come without asking, but I was getting bored at the house, and the idea of a swim was too tempting.” </p><p>“Hey, I’m not going to argue if two sexy girls want to prance around wearing swimsuits,” I said with a smirk, which earned a pair of blushing faces. Admittedly, it wasn’t the smoothest line, but in my experience, flexing a pair of tastefully muscular shoulders went a long way to enhance any flirtatious line. </p><p>I led them to the pool even as I pulled my shirt off, which earned an appreciative hum from Sarah and a shy gasp from Carrie. “Damn, it’s a nice pool,” Sarah murmured in fascination before she grabbed the hem of her dress, only to pull it with a smooth move, revealing her tight body, clad in a relatively modest black bikini set. </p><p>I would have assumed that it was about her trying to help Carrie to seduce me, but interestingly, I could see a hint of vulnerability in her lovely brown eyes as she jumped into the pool in a quickness that contrasted with her brashness. However, no matter how quickly she jumped, it was impossible for her to hide her spectacular-looking ass, its tightness compensating for its relatively modest portions. It was displayed even better when she jumped forward, straining the capabilities of her bottom to contain her tight ass. </p><p>Interesting attitude, delicious body, I noted mentally. </p><p>Her hesitancy disappeared when her body was concealed under the dark waters of the pool. “Come on, Carrie, don’t keep us waiting,” she said immediately. Outwardly, she was trying to help Carrie to push through her shyness, but it was hard to miss the patronizing edge in her tone. If the way Carrie’s eyes tightened was any indicator, I wasn’t the only one to take note of that particular detail. </p><p>I wondered if this particular point of discontent could be useful. </p><p>“Do you mind showing me a room to change?” Carrie asked, which made Sarah’s eyes widen in surprise. </p><p>“Sure,” I said as I followed her. </p><p>Carrie stayed silent until we reached a room that couldn’t be seen from the pool, and I realized the reason for Sarah’s surprised expression. Because Carrie was quick to free her body from her dress, revealing a modest one-piece underneath that somehow even managed to hide Carrie’s delicious curves. </p><p>“I’m so sick of her patronizing attitude,” she whispered as she tried to reach for the zipper on the back. </p><p>“Let me help,” I said as I grabbed the zipper, pulling it down hungrily to reveal her back. “But her attitude is understandable. You’re acting too shy with them, so they don’t know the dirty vixen underneath,” I added as I caressed along her spine. </p><p>Her blush at the word vixen indicated that Sarah was truly not to blame other than a bit excessive patronizing. “Still, she’s too patronizing about it,” she said as she shed her one-piece, revealing her naked body to my hungry gaze. It might not be the first time I saw her in her birthday suit, but it didn’t prevent me from sporting a raging boner. </p><p>“Well, we can deal with that tonight if you want,” I offered with a wide smile as I dwindled the distance between us to nothingness, close enough for her nipples to brush against my chest. </p><p>“L-like what?” she stammered, even more affected by our closeness. </p><p>“Just try to be your confident self whenever we’re alone,” I whispered as I cupped her ass and pulled her tight, pressing my concealed shaft against her stomach. “Other than that, I’ll challenge both of you together until she fails to take the challenge.” </p><p>“You think that would work?” she asked with a cute whisper. </p><p>In response, I kissed her aggressively. “Well, considering you’re confident enough to kiss me naked while Sarah might get curious and wander around, I trust you to handle that.” </p><p>That reminder didn’t help her flailing confidence. And as much as I enjoyed watching her blush spread into her naked body, I actually did need to return before Sarah got suspicious. After throwing one last smirk her way, I left. </p><p>I found Sarah on the corner of the pool, peering inside intently, no doubt curious about what was going on. Luckily, I was quick enough that her curiosity hadn’t turned into suspicion. “Is there anything I can help with?” Sarah asked curiously. </p><p>“No, she said she decided to change her swimsuit,” I explained, and immediately after, jumped in the pool, flexing my muscles to display. </p><p>“Good,” Sarah said. She looked like she wanted to say something more, but with her gaze dipping down to my wide shoulders, I could see her swallowing the next portion she was about to say. Instead, she opened an inconsequential discussion about classes. However, interestingly, I could see her eyes dancing on my muscles whenever she thought I wasn’t looking, with a blush that she relied on the relative darkness of the pool to hide. </p><p>Five minutes passed, but Carrie was yet to appear. “She’s a bit shy,” Sarah finally commented on her lengthy disappearance. </p><p>“Actually, I found her quite a bit more articulate when she’s not in a crowd,” I said. “I wouldn’t be surprised if she’s even more adventurous than you once she warms up.” </p><p>“That’s a bit stretch,” Sarah countered immediately at her pride being pricked, clearly not appreciating my comment, reacting even at the cost of making an indirect dig to her friend. Though I could see that it was unintentional, a reaction to her shyness. </p><p>After all, Sarah’s personality could be only classified as outgoing and dominant compared to the rest of her friends, half of it unable to speak to strangers while the other half with a tendency to lose themselves in their own hobbies. Compared to them, Sarah was a shining example of extrovert personality. </p><p>However, in truth, she was just as shy as the rest, just hiding it better. </p><p>Therefore, when I claimed Carrie might not be as shy as she looked, it assaulted the way she defined herself, therefore reacting easily. Unfortunately, that was exactly what I wanted, because on the end of that road lay some really interesting possibilities. It wasn’t the nicest thing to do, but with the elusive possibility of a threesome tempting me, personally, I had no problem sliding back to bad-boy territory for a moment. </p><p>“Oh, really?” I said, adding just enough mocking edge to force her to answer. “So, you’re saying that you push as far as Carrie is willing to tonight if I can successfully goad her into some interesting party games.” </p><p>“Not even a challenge,” she responded quickly. To her defense, she managed to keep her tone relatively even, so much that if it wasn’t for her growing blush, visible even in the dimly lit pool, I might have believed her conviction. </p><p>“Excellent, it’s a bet then,” I said. I didn’t talk about the stakes, because, ultimately, there was nothing I could directly ask that would be more interesting than the consequences of her struggle for the bet.  </p><p>Before Sarah could say anything, Carrie walked in, wearing a red bikini that barely supported her prodigious breasts, not that they needed any support in the first place. It wasn’t a revealing set, or more accurately, wouldn’t have been revealing on someone with a more ordinary bust size. Her breasts strained against the fabric as she walked toward us, each step making her breast bounce. </p><p>Her hips were no less impressive, even if the bottom of her bikini made an impressive effort to hide everything successfully. Unfortunately, the bikini was clearly purchased before Carrie had completed her growth sport, and every step was straining the capability of her bottoms to contain her plump ass, with a delicious result. </p><p>“Sorry about being late, but I had some trouble fitting to my swimsuit,” Carrie said, hiding a smug undertone under her shy statement as she slid herself into the water carefully, which was the correct choice. I doubted whether her bikini could survive such exertion. Even as she slowly moved toward us, her swimsuit was straining to its maximum capacity. </p><p>“So, you decided not to wear the one-piece after all,” Sarah cut in, trying to hide her shock at Carrie’s choice of swimsuit. She was clearly aware of the existence of the bikini that was struggling to contain Carrie’s body, and she obviously believed that Carrie could never wear them in front of a boy. </p><p>If she had been more alert, she might have realized that my goading her into a bet worked suspiciously well with Carrie’s change of swimsuit, but luckily, she was distracted by Carrie’s impressive display, leaving the night bare with a multitude of possibilities… </p>",

    "content": "<p>As I working on the practice problem the day after my memorable night with Carrie, trying to focus on something more than the amazing memories I had collected, I felt something hitting on the back of my head, followed by a bunch of suppressed laughter. </p><p>“Perfect,” I murmured. I finally got the attention of the bullies. I had been hoping that as students that were about to go to college, my cohort was above childish bullying like spitballs during the class, but it seemed that I was being unnecessarily hopeful. Being legally adults didn’t mean much to everyone as I had hoped, apparently… From the corner of my eye, I looked at the responsible party, only to see a few boys sitting in the middle of the class, completely ordinary other than the quality of their clothes, which was a cut above the rest. </p><p>Rich kids, I realized. It wasn’t the first time I was dealing with those, and they usually came in three different veins. The first, and the smallest group, were the ones that were able to find something interesting to do with their life, be it sports, business, or classes, therefore the least annoying party between all, as even with their entitlement, they were too focused on their target to mess with others. </p><p>The second group was the slackers. With the safety net of their family wealth combined with uncaring parentage, they acted out, but rarely in the confines of the school. They preferred to have long nights of car racing or drugs —depending on the size of their family wealth and the irresponsibility of their parents— to messing around in the classroom. Not because they were even close to maturity or respect, of course. No, they preferred to sleep in class rather than act out, resting during the day to lash out during the night. </p><p>The last relevant group consisted of the ones unable to meet their families’ aggressive expectations or lacked the attention in the first place, but too cowardly to act out in a truly dangerous manner, and therefore, chose to act out in the school, usually not amounting to anything more than a minor nuisance. They were even rarely bullied in any worthwhile manner, choosing to conduct themselves in childish ways rather than a manner that might present them in a dangerous manner. </p><p>From the way they glanced toward a redhead that was sitting on the opposite side of the class with a lovesick expression, it wasn’t hard to guess that they were using their casual bullying in a way to get her attention. She looked familiar for some reason, but I failed to recognize from where. </p><p>Honestly, not the best way of attracting a woman. Not that bullying didn’t work to attract women —usually either the ones with problematic home lives, leaving them unable to truly separate negative and positive attention, or the ones who watched far too many romantic movies about beautiful princesses reforming the troubled bad boys through the power of their lives. It wasn’t a way I wanted to emulate, but it would be a lie to say it wasn’t effective. </p><p>Unfortunately for them, my would-be bullies had the aura of petulant man-children rather than tragic bad boys, with all the disdain it evoke. Even the redhead, who didn’t dress or act like a part of the popular clique —despite her lovely face and beautiful hair— looked at them with derision, but the boys lacked the awareness to notice that particular detail. </p><p>I sighed as I did my best to focus on the formulas on the whiteboard, expecting them to get bored. Unfortunately, they didn’t do so until the end of the class. </p><p>When the bell rang, I gathered my stuff with deliberate slowness, trying to decide how to handle the situation. Unfortunately, teaching them a lesson publicly was not an option. The attention it would bring would have been annoying enough, but even worse was the risk of possible disciplinary action, something that would be a glaring problem in my college application, especially if their rich parents escalate the situation. </p><p>I didn’t want to ruin the opportunity of a lifetime just to beat up a couple of dorks. But also, I didn’t want to let things go without payback as well, as it was how people suddenly found themselves as the favorite target of the bullies. </p><p>Distracted by my thoughts, I didn’t notice a surprise visitor until a shadow fell on me. I raised my head, prepared to lash out to my bullies, only to stop myself as I glimpsed the sunlight shining on a lock of auburn hair. </p><p>“Hi,” said the redhead who had been the target of my incompetent bullies. Normally, I would have been a bit weird by her sudden attention, but her apologetic expression, combined with the momentarily annoyed glare she sent toward the boys gave me an idea about her aim. Since none of the involved parties were high enough in the school’s totem pole, the rest of the class walked out, not paying any attention to our little fracas. Though, for some reason, she still looked a bit more familiar than the memorability that would be gained from a random glance at the corridor. </p><p>“Hello,” I said with a charming smile as I noticed the angry glares of two annoying boys in the background, clearly jealous of the sudden attention I was getting. “How can I help such a ravishing example of beauty?” I asked, a bit louder than necessary, but letting my smile getting an amused edge to clue in about my aim. </p><p>Her beautiful hazel eyes shone in understanding, suggesting that she understood my aim. “Oh, handsome, and still a gentleman. Aren’t you a rare treasure?” she said, just like my statement, a bit louder than necessary. “I just wanted to welcome you to our school.” </p><p>“Very much appreciated,” I said even as I threw my bag on my shoulder. “Then, would you care to accompany me to the cafeteria?”</p><p>“My pleasure,” she said, and just like that, we walked out of the classroom, under the aghast realization of my incompetent bullies, realizing that they had managed to create the opposite effect they had been seeking. </p><p>We walked silently for a while. Then, she looked back before starting to speak. “Sorry about Mike and Jerry, they can be a bit much.” </p><p>I waved my hand. “Don’t worry, they are little more than annoying flies, and it’s not your fault in the first place that they are still stuck on playground tactics of flirting.” </p><p>She just shrugged, which worked perfectly to communicate her own uncaring distaste about their childish behavior. Then, after a moment’s silence, she managed to surprise me. “You’re not like I expected,” she stated suddenly, without a preamble. </p><p>It was a weird statement, and if it came from someone else, I might have answered it tersely. However, in my books, being a cute redhead earned enough points to tolerate a dash of quirkiness. “How so?” </p><p>“Considering how well you’re getting along with your new tutor, I expected another nerd unable to speak with a new person without stammering at least a word in every sentence. You’re certainly more smooth than I expected,” she said. </p><p>It was a weird statement, but her focus on my new tutor finally allowed me to remember where I had seen her before, though at a distance. She was one of Carrie’s friends that had been giggling around her just before I met her in the library the first time. </p><p>Since she was Carrie’s friend, I was willing to cut her some slack. </p><p>“D-does t-this help?” I suddenly stammered even as I crouched a bit, bringing my books to my chest like a shield, trying to look like a fearful nerd trying to avoid his bullies. </p><p>That earned a burst of laughter. “It helps a bit,” she said. “So, what brings you to Sunny High?” That launched a small discussion about my transfer, which I answered as directly as possible, though she spoke more than I did even as she was the one seeking answers. She was rather chatty, but luckily, not in an annoying way. </p><p>Then, I made the mistake of saying I wasn’t interested in one of the more recent fantasy blockbuster TV series. “How!” she gasped in shock. “The Dragon Sword is the most amazing TV series, ever! It has magic, it has action, it has politics!” </p><p>“Maybe I should watch it,” I said, even as I decided to mess with a little. She wasn’t doing well in hiding her interest in interrogating me about Carrie, but I didn’t really want to talk about it with Irene before I could better understand their relationship. “They say TV series even better than the books,” I said. I didn’t really know about it, nor did I care, but I remember last year some of the fans in the school coming blows on the topic. It was clearly something that divided the fans. </p><p>Irene proved she was one of those fans that took the issue seriously, as it triggered a lengthy explanation, that while the TV series was groundbreaking, it was only in terms of the silver screen, and ultimately, it could never rival the majesty and the complexity of the books. </p><p>Her explanation continued as we arrived at the cafeteria, and while I intended to move to my own table, she grabbed my arm and dragged me toward her table. A table that was already filled with the rest of their little clique, including a very familiar blonde. </p><p>“We have a new guest today, girls,” said Irene as she pushed me to a seat, far too aggressive than I had expected her to. “He thinks that the TV show for the Dragon’s Sword better than the books.” </p><p>The table seemed to share my opinion, as a collective groan escaped their mouth. “That’s enough, Irene,” said Sarah immediately as she laughed. “We don’t want to chase the only boy that’s willing to sit on the table with us weirdos.” </p><p>Irene pouted, but under the laugher of the rest of the group, she was barely able to say anything. Meanwhile, I could see Sarah poking Carrie several times in an effort to make her speak, but Carrie was busy blushing, unable to say anything. </p><p>Her reaction was extremely cute considering we had spent a majority of the night —and a short yet delicious encore in the morning— testing her flexibility for a number of positions in the bed, against the wall, and in the shower… She was no doubt dealing with those vivid memories, which overwhelmed her capability to suppress her shyness when she was among her friends… </p><p>Sarah, however, clearly misunderstood the reason for her shyness, so she was trying to push Carrie to speak. After half a minute, she sighed. “Let me introduce our little team of misfits,” she said. “You already met our resident fantasy nerd Irene,” she said, pointing at the curvy redhead that had been bombarding me with various inconsistencies between the book and the TV series. </p><p>“I’m Naomi,” burst in the other brunette girl on the table. Though, unlike Sarah, her skin was dark enough to suggest mixed heritage, and her curves were significantly more attention-grabbing. “Yoga enthusiast.” </p><p>“You mean health nut,” Sarah cut in with a smirk, making Naomi frown playfully. “Never let her drag you to a mall, or you’ll learn there’s just how many stores that sell supplements and weird accessories.” </p><p>“Hey, they are not weird,” Naomi cut in, but she was ignored. </p><p>Sarah then pointed at the brown-haired girl with eyes that betrayed another mixed heritage, this time Asian. “And this is Ida, our cute exchange student. Never agree to join her for a gaming session unless you have a weekend to waste.” </p><p>“Hey,” Ida said with a cute, barely audible exclamation, but she was smiling. </p><p>“And you already met with our nerdy honor student, Carrie,” Sarah said, slightly frustrated as Carrie was still skipping the opportunity to speak. </p><p>With that, the group started talking hesitantly, no doubt trying to process my presence, while I examined the unique beauty of the girls I was sharing a table with. Before meeting with Carrie, I would never have paid attention to such a group due to their relatively obscure look, lacking the make-up and the trendy clothing to highlight their beauty, but after Carrie, I realized just how big of a treasure trove it was. </p><p>Especially since Carrie and I were not dating, but I was teaching her about the various aspects of intimacy. As I listened to the group dawdle on an inane nerdy topic, I was already wondering whether it was possible to have a guest visitor in our tutoring sessions… </p>",

    "content": "<p>I watched with great interest as Sapphire collapsed on the bed the moment I allowed her to do so, not putting the slightest resistance as I freed her body completely from the remaining pieces of her maid costume. It wasn’t that her costume was hiding a lot of stuff, but I wanted to see her have unobstructed access to her body as we played around. </p><p> I lay next to her, equally naked, while she focused on catching her breath. I thought about what to say as I caressed her hair with uncharacteristic gentleness, enjoying the incredible contrast as she shivered with pleasure under my touch. I even pulled her against my chest as she breathed hard, trying to get rid of the aftereffects of her orgasm, made particularly hard by the side effects of the magic she had used. </p><p>As I let my hand caress her body, exploring some of the lesser sensitive spots on her arms and her stomach, she slowly gathered her wits. Her expression turned unfamiliar, tenderness mixing into her usual sharpness. That wasn’t to say that she wasn’t angry, but in the mix of emotions, anger was only a small part. From the corner of my eye, I watched as her expression slowly solidified, ready to launch a discussion. </p><p>“We need to talk,” she said, her voice echoing with determination. It was sharp and solid, but easy to ignore for that exact reason. Her voice was sharp, because she was trying to convince herself that she was able to think unobstructed once more. And since she was having trouble believing it herself, it was clearly not true. </p><p>No, mentally, she was already mine. Not just for the night, but forever. All that required was for her to understand that. </p><p>“Really? Go ahead?” I said, my tone soft enough to imply that I was actually a kind person, which was the farthest thing from reality. However, she was just vulnerable enough to be affected by that. It was amusing to watch her expression, which she had established with great care, flicker just after a simple statement. Her self-confidence turned soft immediately when our eyes met, making her determination flail. </p><p>“It’s about our deal…” she started, only to stop when I let my hand climb upward, caressing the bottom of her breasts. “Do you mind stopping?” </p><p>“I do mind, actually,” I answered. “But a gentle caress shouldn’t affect you.” </p><p>She sent a disapproving glare, but realizing my fingers were dancing on the underside of her breast, ignoring her silent disapproval, she folded quickly. After all, touch wasn’t exactly something to care about after everything we had done together. “I need the location of the Eternal Core,” she said stiffly. </p><p>“And I want angels to come down from heaven and kiss my cock, but we can’t have everything we want,” I said, slapping her tit to underline my statement. “You’re smart enough to realize that it’s the only leverage to ensure I can keep my head. So, unless you can make me an offer good enough to risk my neck, I’m going to delay that particular item. But you’re still interested in the other items I offer, right?” </p><p>At this point, her disapproving silence was adorable. “Isn’t the survival of the continent enough reason?” she asked. </p><p>“Honestly, no,” I said with a dismissive laugh, while my hands climbed up to her amazing breasts, and start playing with her nipples alternatingly, squeezing and twisting, treating them as a toy. She gasped. “I’m far from being a saint, and possible survival of the continent is not one of my responsibilities. And that’s assuming I believe you.” </p><p>“What do you mean? You think I would lie something as important!” she said, trying to rise, but my hand was enough to keep her laying. She squirmed, trying to stand up, making me hug to keep her in place. </p><p>“Calm down, sweetie,” I said, amused by her sudden shocked expression. Though, admittedly, her reaction was less about my words, and more about the fact that I used the opportunity to slide inside her, making her let out a surprised moan. I continued speaking even as I started pumping my hips. “I can’t comment whether your need is about a critical defense issue, but I’m sure it’s not bad enough to threaten the whole continent. If it was so, you wouldn’t have used your forces to attack my other client, but instead used it to collaborate with the dark faction. It would have cost you a pretty penny, but it would be enough to handle the threat.” </p><p>“I can’t bet the survival of the continent on a Dark Lord,” she countered, trying to ignore my gentle pumping. “What if they ally with the threat instead.” </p><p>“Come on, sweetie, you’re forgetting that he was another client, and I had a decent understanding of his personality. He might have extracted some nasty benefits for himself, but he wasn’t idiotic enough to risk his lands against a fundamental threat. The fact that you didn’t ally with him implies that it’s a threat either for your Empire, or more likely, for your power structure.” The way she flinched at the last part was more than enough for me to understand the issue. </p><p>“It’s not like that, but I see that I can’t convince you,” she said, trying to distract me from the truth, realizing her attempt to reach my nonexistent mercy had failed spectacularly. </p><p>“Exactly, sweetie,” I said, stopping to steal a small kiss from her lips as I gently explored her insides, contrasting greatly with my earlier invasion. “I’m just a small-time merchant, trying to survive in this complicated world. You just need to throw a few morsels to my side, and I’ll help you to the best of my ability.” I chuckled. “I take customer satisfaction very seriously, as you learned in a very personal manner.” </p><p>“Asshole,” she murmured, but my reminder about her chain orgasms worked wonderfully to change the issue. </p><p>“So, sweetie, would you like to talk about what you want to offer me for the next map, or would you like to talk about it in the morning?” I asked. </p><p>“In the morning? Why, do you need to leave again?” </p><p>“Nope,” I answered with a smirk. “I don’t have anything to do for the rest of the night, but that doesn’t mean that we need to ruin the night talking business. Not when we can use it in a much more productive way.” </p><p>“Never,” she reacted angrily, though her reaction might have been more convincing if she wasn’t already in my arms, moaning obediently as I pumped inside her repeatedly. I doubted it would take much effort to convince her to stay until the morning, but when she once again started to talk about the bargain, I let talk uninterrupted —other than the occasional moan. </p><p>“As you wish, then, please tell me what are you willing to offer, your majesty,” I said, reminding her about her position, which contrasted greatly with her current location and our gentle lovemaking. She started offering several items </p><p>“I can give you two of the artifacts you asked for, the blade of shadows, and the tether of the underworld,” she answered. </p><p>“Hmm, it’s not exactly a spectacular offer, but I might accept it on one condition,” I said lazily, hiding my reaction. Actually, I was quite satisfied with her offer. The blade of shadows was not an extremely famous blade, lacking the explosive might of some of the more famous magical weapons, but considering my current constraints, that kind of flashy effect was not something I could rely on in the first place. No, the blade of shadows was perfect because, essentially, it was a magical staff in form of a short sword, significantly amplifying the strength of any magical spell, especially if it was related to darkness and shadows, like my favorite concealment spells. </p><p>The tether, on the other hand, was not about necromancy despite its name. It was owned by a famous lich, but ultimately, it was a useful support item to break and construct wards, making it a very useful tool for defensive-minded dark lords. Or in my circumstances, for a particularly naughty thief. </p><p>“What’s your condition?” she asked. </p><p>“I want to make the trade in a different location.” </p><p>“Out of the question,” she answered. “This place is already dangerous enough for me. Don’t forget that I’m the Queen. I will not come to your base to be imprisoned.” </p><p>Considering our current circumstances, her statement was rather ridiculous. She might trust the club after using the place for years, but despite her misconception, arranging to steal her from the place was almost trivial. Luckily for her, she was almost completely worthless as a prisoner. I liked Aria a lot, but if I actually took Sapphire hostage, the other councilors would turn her into a puppet in less than a week, and would take the crown in a month. Still, the image of the queen, chained to a dark room was very exciting. </p><p>“Don’t tempt me,” I whispered into her ear, making her shiver. I let the silence stretch for a while as I slowly picked up the pace. “Don’t worry about the danger of the location. Actually, what I have in mind is much safer.” </p><p>“What do you have in mind?” she asked. </p><p>“The throne room,” I said. The way her eyes widened was simply beautiful. It was a risky location, but after the obvious signs of her growing obedience, I was willing to take the risk. Making her mine in the center of her power was too tempting to deny. </p><p>“Impossible,” she answered after a momentary freeze, scandalized. However, the way she tightened around my girth betrayed her arousal. Clearly, I wasn’t the only one imagining such a thrilling moment. </p><p>“Why not,” I said with a smirk. “All you need to do is to use magical defenses and send the guards away for the night. You’re smart enough to find a valid reason,” I said. She opened her mouth, but before she could say anything, my lips were on hers, stealing her words. I put one of my hands to the small of her back, a gentle caress making her back arch as the arousal invaded her body. </p><p>The kiss lasted for a couple of minutes while her resistance melted quickly. “It’s too risky,” she managed to mutter after pulling back for a breather, but lacking conviction behind her words. </p><p>“Even better,” I said. “There’s nothing like a little danger to make it more fun, or are you going to say that you can’t handle a little adrenaline?” </p><p>She didn’t manage to answer before I leaned for another kiss. Interestingly, this time, she met my lips midway instead of waiting passively, proving that she was getting rather used to my touch. I probed her lips with my tongue, and her lips parted open, allowing my tongue to access her mouth. She started moaning, the tenderness of my touch mixing wonderfully with her body, aching for another climax. </p><p>When I pulled out of her and gave her a little push, she lay on her back readily, her legs parted open invitingly, anticipation rapidly dominating her face as I positioned her at the entrance. However, rather than sliding in, I asked, “So, how about my request about the location.” </p><p>She froze for a moment, and I waited for her answer despite her expression giving me a pretty accurate clue about it. “You win,” she murmured in defeat after a minute, closing her eyes. </p><p>“No, your majesty,” I said as I slid in, her walls once again clamping around my girth. “We win.” With that, my lips pressed on hers once more, leveraging our physical closeness for maximum benefit. The way her legs wrapped around my waist suggested that I wasn’t the only one enjoying the changing nature of our physical closeness. </p><p>Her cry vibrated in my mouth as I pulled deeper inside her, tempting me to impale her even harder, which in turn made her moan even louder in a divine example of reinforcing structure. The tender nature of our lovemaking was being particularly effective due to the after-effects of her climaxes along with the aftermath of her tantric attempts of dominance. I continued to slide in a leisure manner as she helplessly tightened around me, her trembles intensifying, telling me that she had just experienced another climax. Her eyes were closed as she was dominated under a rush of unfamiliar sensations, allowing me to see an unfamiliar softness glowing on her face. </p><p>Her growing obedience and my success in terms of the artifacts we were about to trade… My time with Sapphire was going much better than I could have hoped for… </p>",

    "content": "<p>As I stood on the one end of a large tunnel, with a spear in hand, the deafening cheers of a hundred thousand Romans echoing in my ears as they belied for blood, the only thing I could focus on was the overwhelming weight of the magical wards of Pomerium, doing its best to disrupt me as I tried to reinforce my weapon with some magic.</p><p>“No wonder they assume it’s impossible to use magic in Pomerium,” I murmured as I exerted my magic as much as I could to reinforce the handle of my weapon. I was about to face an unknown monster, and the last thing I wanted was for my weapon to snap. Not that I couldn’t take a monster with a broken weapon, but considering the reaction of the gladiator leader, it was clearly going to be a battle that was supposed to be hopeless. Making the fight convincingly epic was going to be difficult without a broken weapon. </p><p>Luckily, my assumption about the internal magic usage was accurate. Pushing the magic externally was very difficult without being extinguished by the city-wide wards, but the same didn’t apply when I used to enhance my muscles. </p><p>I was confident to face whatever they had to face me. </p><p>When one of the guards gestured me to move, I started to walk toward the other end of the tunnel until my path was blocked by the iron bars. However, I was close enough to see the endless stone seats, housing Roman citizens of all social classes, from the highest to lowest. Since today was a religious day sanctioned by the priest, it was one of the most important games, and spilling blood made it more important. </p><p>The most important part for me, however, was the seats closest to the arena, filled to the brim with the Senators, Tribunes, and other important officials. I could even see the two Consuls, the highest public officials, surrounded by their Praetorian guard, holding their thick clubs —one interesting thing about Pomerium forbidding weapons, swords in particular, but also spears and other visibly martial weapons, leaving clubs and daggers as the preferred getup for the bodyguards whenever they were in Pomerium. </p><p>As I waited for the fight the begin, I watched the slaves dragging the dead body of several prisoners —obvious from the way they dressed— while some animal trainers were trying to drag a lion back to its cage. The bloodied sand suggested that it had been a deadly bout, not that it was surprising considering a bunch of prisoners was supposed to fight against dangerous wild beasts. </p><p>Then, the iron bars pulled back, and a crier shouted. “From the west gate, great Dacian spearmen, Peirous, stepping the holy ground of Coliseum for the first time,” he shouted. </p><p>The enthusiastic cries of the hundred thousand Roman citizens slammed to me like thunder. At that moment, it didn’t matter those men and women would have treated me like dirt for being a slave. No, at this moment, I was an incarnation of Mars, ready to spill blood. </p><p>I slammed the butt of my spear against my metal buckler repeatedly as I walked, greeting the crowd just as we were taught in the school, making sure to display the muscles of my naked torso to the best effect in the process. After all, the whole point of my presence was to impress the crowd, especially the female half, so that they would invite me to their estates. </p><p>The announcer paused for a while, letting the tension build up as the crowd examined me while wondering about my opponent. Meanwhile, I let my gaze brush through the crowd, using my sharp sight to quickly identify the young and good-looking daughters and wives of the groups that looked especially rich. There was no harm in identifying the potential targets. </p><p>“And from the east gate, we have a mysterious cursed beast from the mountains of Greece,” he called even as the gates went down, and a huge beast lunged forward. I cursed in my mind as I prepared to lunge to the side as I processed the sight, while the announcer completed his introduction. “A great Chimera!”</p><p>“Fuck,” I murmured as I threw myself to the side as the fucking creature covered the distance in an instant and lunged forward, trying to devour me immediately. The crowd went wild as I rolled back, avoiding its paw swipe. </p><p>“A fucking Chimera,” I murmured in shock as I watched the cursed animal. A lion taller than a human was dangerous enough without adding a second head with even bigger teeth that resembled a goat with huge, intimidating horns that looked strong enough to break through rock. Its multiple tails, each ending with the head of a snake, made it even more dangerous, especially with the venom dripping down every single visible tooth, be it on its tails or its heads. </p><p>And like its attack parts weren’t dangerous enough, it was crazy fast. </p><p>Admittedly, it wasn’t the strongest creature I faced, not even close. It didn’t have the magic resistance of an ethereal beast, or the destructive potential of a disaster-class beast. Even the dragon serpent I had killed was more dangerous than it, though only because it was familiar. Without that advantage, their power was more or less equal. </p><p>One advantage, I thought as I dodged another swipe as it made another pass, forcing me to avoid its paw and its venomous tail at the same time, I didn’t need to spend a lot of effort on how to make my victory impressive. As long as I took down it without relying on any external magic —which would see me executed, therefore out of question in the first place— it would make a small legend of me. </p><p>“Tail first,” I murmured to myself as it charged toward me once more. The tails were dangerous not only because of their venom, but because they worked as a teammate, defending the back of the creature. So, when the creature closed in once more, testing my reaction, I threw myself forward, my spear moving in a flash, slamming into one of the snakeheads that decorated its tails, spilling the first blood. </p><p>The crowd went absolutely crazy as I rolled back, avoiding the retaliation of the beast. Feeling the unexpected bite of the pain, Chimera stayed away from my weapon, giving me the chance to raise my spear to greet the crowd, wordlessly promising them victory. Cheers rose as I did so, making my blood move in excitement. </p><p>I would be lying if I didn’t enjoy the moment. Combat was always exciting, and the cheers of a hundred thousand people made the moment even more exciting. Though I clamped on my magic strongly when I felt a stirring in my right arm, not wanting the scales to appear. </p><p>However, it resulted in a surprising reaction. Chimera suddenly sniffed the air, only to stiffen in a way that resembled the fear. It was clearly smelling my irregularity. Luckily, its tenseness disappeared as I managed to suppress my magic, and dashed forward once more, losing another tail. </p><p>Soon, we repeated the same dance more than twenty times, making it lose three of its five tails, along with a number of bodily wounds that turned its body into a crimson patchwork. It didn’t affect its vitality much, however. I had long got used to its speed and reach, and I could have used its next attack to stab its head, dealing a more serious wound. </p><p>I decided to make the show more impressive. The next attack, I deliberately received a blow to my shield, which threw me back, and my spear flew away, ‘accidentally’ falling toward the raised platform at the center that housed the two Consuls, surrounded by the richest citizens, giving me the excuse I needed to make eye contact with the richest women in Rome. As long as I could impress one of them, it would have been quite fun. </p><p> The creature might be an animal, but it was still smart enough to position itself between me and the spear. The crowd cried in panic while the creature roared victoriously, preparing itself to lunge forward. I removed the buckler from my arm, and grabbed it with both hands, ready to use it as a more flexible weapon. </p><p>Chimera chose that moment to unveil a new weapon, suddenly belching fire from its mouth. </p><p>I raised the shield hurriedly as I lunged back, avoiding most of the fire, though my fingers were looking red. I held up my buckler, using it to protect myself even as the metal heated up, waiting for the opportunity while the audience cried in shock. I used my right hand to hold my buckler, as otherwise, my hands were burned from the heat of the shield, starting to glow red. </p><p>I found the opportunity I was seeking when the creature took a breath, preparing for another flaming roar. Without any warning, I grabbed the edge of the shield and threw it like a disk with my full strength, accurately targeting the face of the creature. It roared in pain as the red hot edge of the shield dug in its eye, ruining it forever. I used the opportunity to sprint across the sand, passing next to it. The remaining tails attacked at the same time with a paw swipe. I dodged the tails. </p><p>Paw attack, landed. </p><p>Still, at the last moment, I managed to skip to the one side, making it a glancing hit. I dashed toward my discarded spear, using the time it needed to turn its huge body to the maximum benefit. Then, I arrived in front of the raised platform that housed some of the most prestigious members of Roman society, and let my gaze linger on some of the most beautiful young ladies, even winking at one of them. </p><p>She was a delicious-looking redhead with a lithe body, her beautiful white shoulders shining under the shade raised to protect her sensitive skin. And when she realized I was making eye contact, she blushed prettily. I smirked once more before turning my back, only to find myself face to face with the creature. </p><p>The battle lasted another fifteen minutes, where I managed to deliver a series of punishing blows while the crowds repeated the new name I had acquired. “Peirous, Peirous, Peirous!” they chanted repeatedly, making my blood flow faster and faster as I dodged attack after attack, leaving another bleeding wound in the aftermath. My own wounds looked horribly bad, but they were mostly cosmetic. </p><p>Then, the creature finally collapsed, allowing me to stab its heads in quick succession, finally killing it, much to the excitement of the crowd, especially the ladies, who enjoyed my show with much excitement. I could already see many patrician families discussing heatedly while young girls rained flowers on me. </p><p>“Victor, Peirous!” called the announcer as I slowly walked toward the tunnel I had entered. </p><p>Rome just gained a new celebrity… </p>",

    "content": "<p>I stayed at the safe house for an hour, searching the place from top to bottom, but unfortunately, failed to find anything other than the cage itself and the unique nature of the wards. So, I dismantled them while taking notes about the way they came together, and destroyed the cage after taking some pieces as the sample. It was the only clue about their origin. </p><p>As a bonus, it finally completed my arcana skill. </p><p>[+3 Arcana]</p><p>Also, Helga would appreciate the gift of another magical project, especially it was based on a completely novel theoretical base. </p><p>Slipping the defensive guards Titania posted around the inn she had chosen as the temporary base for herself was completely trivial, making me shook my head at their incompetence. One of those days, I really needed to develop a solution to that, to defend the girls, if for nothing else. </p><p>When I arrived at Titania’s room, I met with a pleasant surprise. She wasn’t alone, but being tended by a healer for her wounds, her shirt removed for the ease of access. And to make things even more fun, the healer was extremely familiar as well. </p><p>“Hello, girls,” I said as I slipped in from a window and established a ward behind myself. </p><p>“Caesar,” Titania said stiffly while Marianne looked just shocked at my sudden presence. Then, she turned to Marianne. “You can go,” she said as she reached for her shirt, trying to hide her blush while trying to make it look like my intrusion was normal. </p><p>I turned to Titania. “Don’t worry, we’re good friends with Marianne. Aren’t we, sweetie?”</p><p>“Y-yes,” Marianne stammered, shocked by the way I had been speaking to Titania, while Titania’s face twisted with a sudden surge of jealousy, smart enough to realize the implications of my words, especially since I had previously taken Helga in front of her when she was still struggling with her emotional blocking. Now that she was free from it, she was struggling with the emotional aspects of it. </p><p>“Why are you here?” Titania said testily, her distaste clear as she struggled with the unfamiliar tinge of jealousy.  </p><p>I walked closer, amused by her reaction. “To help you recover from the great exertion you displayed before you left for another battle, of course,” I said even as I leaned forward and captured her lips. Despite her frustration, she lacked the willpower to reject my lips, moaning as I slipped my tongue into her mouth, moaning as I let my mana fill her mouth. </p><p>[-381 Mana]</p><p>Lost in the kiss, she realized too late that I used her distraction to sit next to her and pull her on my lap. Only when our lips were separated, she realized the trick I had pulled, and looked at me with a cute frustration that would have left others in disbelief, that the famous librarian of Silver Spires could display an expression fit to a teenager. </p><p>Marianne was definitely one of those shocked ones, her blue eyes wide.</p><p>“So,” I said even as I hugged Titania’s naked waist. “What do you think about the sudden change of strategy?” </p><p>“Caesar,” she gasped as one of my hands slipped down. “What are you doing!” </p><p>“Hugging you, of course,” I said with a smirk as I turned my gaze to Marianne, who was watching us in shock, though a small smile was also worming itself on her face. She was too meek to feel jealous, especially after everything we had done together, giving me the chance  </p><p>“Not in front of her,” Titania gasped. </p><p>“Well, you didn’t mind a lot when I was …hugging… my other blonde friend in your room,” I said, reminding her of the time I took Helga together. “And we don’t have a lot of time to waste. Marianne, please continue healing her.” </p><p>“Of course,” Marianne said, managing to speak without a stammer, though that didn’t prevent her from blushing. She didn’t argue the slightest, which wasn’t surprising. She was the most submissive of my growing group of intimate friends by far, and the fact that she was in front of Titania, one of the scariest figures she had ever known —especially after watching her decimating two monster armies— made it much easier for her to accept it without the slightest complaint. She pressed her hands on Titania’s arm, flooding her body with the healing energies. Titania was mostly cured, with only a couple of bruises remaining, and even they were disappearing rather rapidly.</p><p>“So,” I whispered to Titania’s ear even as my hand slipped under her skirt, making her shuffle in discomfort, and with no little amount of arousal. “What’s your opinion about the sudden increase in monster attacks.” </p><p>“Clearly planned, and if your sudden appearance is any indicator, they are targeting us directly. But I don’t know who. Maybe me, maybe you through me.” </p><p>“Not a bad assumption,” I said. Targeting Titania through me was the only viable strategy if they were after me. “However, even if that was the case, I’m a target of opportunity at best. After all, my presence is nothing more than a last-minute addition ruining their well-prepared plan. There’s still the question of what they want.” </p><p>“Any clues from the attackers?” Titania asked even as Marianne finished curing her. </p><p>“A few, but they raise more questions than they answered,” I said before turning to Marianne. “By the way, do you mind rubbing my shoulders, I’m feeling exhausted,” I said. Marianne said nothing, but she was quick to follow my request,  her hands landing on my shoulders. </p><p>“Excellent,” I murmured even as I felt Marianne’s mana infusing my shoulders, forcing the tension off. Meanwhile, my hands climbed upward as Titania’s hips tilted upwards, accepting my intrusion in good humor.  </p><p>My hand slid along her inner thigh, climbing upward, fingers massaging sensually. Without watching, my hand crept upward slowly, closer and closer to the hip crease until my little finger found her panties. At that point, I slid my hand up, trailing my little finger along the hem until I discovered her wetness, making her moan. Her own reaction made her blush, especially when she turned and saw a knowing smile on Marianne’s face. “About the attackers?” she reminded me in an effort to distract us from her reaction. </p><p>“That’s a bit complicated,” I said even as my hands continued their dance. “They are a complete unknown, and considering their strength, it’s really surprising. Three people over level twenty, with no clue about their identity,” I said. I undersold their strength a bit, not wanting to alarm them too much before I could discover the identity of the attackers. More importantly, I didn’t mention anything about the true nature of their power, keeping it silent until I could discover more. I trusted Titania, but I didn’t trust the headmistress. </p><p>“Who has the strength to deploy that kind of force,” Titania murmured. </p><p>“That’s the question, sweetheart,” I said. “It’s clearly a part of a much bigger organization. Not only they have clearly had the manpower to throw around, but also their coffers are quite full. Mana gems are not something to throw around the way they had been doing,” I said. </p><p>“Not to mention their ability to manipulate monsters,” Titania commented, though her tone was strained as my erection buried in her ass. And my fingers, dancing over her slit made it even more difficult to keep her voice down. “They are displaying a worrying power trend. It’s intimidating.”</p><p>“No doubt,” I said. “Does your boss have any idea about their identity?” </p><p>“She has some suspicions, but she’s yet to mention them to me. Apparently, their involvement is only incidental,” Titania said. </p><p>“I see,” I murmured. What Titania had mentioned seemed unimportant, but it suggested some stuff. First of all, it meant that our mysterious organization didn’t appear from nowhere. The headmistress was clearly aware of their presence enough to assume she was successfully predicting their objectives. </p><p>Well, considering they were targeting Titania, she clearly misread their objective, but that in itself was another clue. It was clear, I needed a detailed talk with the headmistress, to learn what she had in mind. </p><p>After I finish helping Titania and Marianne recover their mana, of course. </p><p>Titania continued to share her assumptions about the possible identity of the organization, and I listened, but I was more interested in the way my hands were exploring the surface of her panties, while her voice got strained. She blushed as I hiked her skirt around her hips, revealing her hips to my gaze. </p><p>She shivered as I dragged down her panties. “Marianne, do you mind helping me get rid of my shirt,” I said even as I removed Titania’s bra after letting her panties fall on the floor. </p><p>“We can’t,” Titania murmured gently, throwing a panicked glare to Marianne, acting even shyer. “Not with her in place.” </p><p>“You’re not thinking of the advantages,” I whispered even as I gestured Marianne to stop what she had been doing. Instead, I grabbed Titania’s legs and parted them, giving Marianne the perfect angle to show the abilities she had developed during the heated evenings she had spent playing with Cornelia. </p><p>“But-” Titania started, panicking as Marianne positioned between her legs, only to be interrupted as I caught her lips with another searing kiss, flooding her with another flash of mana.</p><p>[-284 Mana] </p><p>Even after I stopped kissing her, Titania failed to say anything, though it was more about Marianne’s finger disappearing into her wetness while her tongue dashed out, caressing her clit. Titania let out a shocking moan. </p><p>Meanwhile, I allowed my hands to move, landing on her breasts, massaging them gently to push her arousal further. </p><p>“It feels…” Titania murmured, only to let herself fade halfway. Meanwhile, she missed one very important detail. One of Marianne’s hands was busy with her entrance, but the other one was working aggressively to free my shaft from its confines. Then, after freeing my shaft and giving one long lick, she pulled back. </p><p>“You’re overdressed,” I said to Marianne even as I grabbed Titania’s hips once more, and lifted her directly to my shaft. She gasped in shock as my shaft disappeared inside her. </p><p>Meanwhile, Marianne took a step back, shrugging off her clothes in a rapid manner. Since she was here for a mission, neither her clothes nor her underwear was particularly attractive, so she was quick the shed them. The same, however, didn’t apply to the amazing curvy body that was hidden underneath, once again tempting me to take a bite to leave another mark. </p><p>Marianne smiled with pride as my eyes were inexorably drawn to her tits. “Anything you like?\" she murmured as she took a step to dwindle the distance between us while she pressed her tits together. Meanwhile, I was moving Titania repeatedly, making her moan. Dumping a lot of mana in the process as well. </p><p>[-513 Mana]</p><p>\"Definitely,\" I answered, kissing enthusiastically as she leaned forward to offer them to my hungry lips. I suckled her plump, juicy nipples between my lips, relishing every delicious second of it. </p><p>I continued to work Titania toward the climax, while I reached Marianne’s poor, neglected pussy. I slipped a couple of fingers inside, and her walls clamped around aggressively, suggesting that she had missed my touch since our last adventure. “Someone is enthusiastic,” I murmured. </p><p>“That’s what happens when someone is neglected,” Marianne murmured with a cute pout even as she continued to squirm around my fingers. Still, she was feeling adventurous enough to put her hands on Titania’s tits, her earlier fear disappearing quickly. The sight of her naked body, jumping up and down on my shaft, was hardly intimidating. </p><p> Meanwhile, Titania continued to clench around my shaft, doing her best to bring me to a climax. Luckily, I had more than enough willpower to delay my explosion. The same didn’t apply to Titania, who was busy crying with ecstasy. </p><p>Things were warming up…</p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 30    Experience: 447193 / 465000 </p><p>Strength: 41    Charisma: 53</p><p>Precision: 35    Perception: 37</p><p>Agility: 35     Manipulation: 40</p><p>Speed: 34       Intelligence: 44</p><p>Endurance: 34      Wisdom: 46</p><p>HP: 5370  / 5370 Mana: 5132  / 6600        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Master Arcana [100/100]</p><p>Master Subterfuge [97/100]         </p><p>Expert Speech [70/75]</p><p>Advanced Craft [50/50]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 21/25]</p><p>[Helga - Level 17/21] </p>",

    "content": "<p>As I slipped into the basement —which was thankfully empty other than a magically-reinforced cage, currently empty— the first thing I noticed was the suppressive aura of magic that somehow wanted me to throw up. There was a sense of wrongness in the air, one I had never felt before, not even I was facing against the necromancers. </p><p>Somehow, whatever was the source, it managed to feel more disgusting than the combined aura of an army of necromancers. </p><p>My first suspect was the cage and the unusual magical runes that surrounded it. But, as I walked closer toward the cage, I realized it wasn’t the source. Like the wards that covered the building, the runic structure of the ward was completely unfamiliar yet complete in a way that suggested a great body of supporting research and practice. But despite the mystery it contained, it wasn’t the source of my discomfort. </p><p>No, the source was radiating from upstairs. </p><p>I was rather glad for my great agility as I silently walked toward the stairs that led to the upstairs, doing my best to hide my presence. Luckily, the door to the upstairs was open, allowing me to peek inside. </p><p>Inside, I noticed three people, sitting silently around a table with faces of stone. One of them had a staff leaning against himself, while the other two were dressed like ordinary peasants —but my eyes were sharp enough to identify an impressive number of hidden weapons under their clothes. They looked ready to act. On the table lay another gem, driving the crazed monsters to attack the town. </p><p>However, I was more interested in the passive aura that was spreading out of them that made me queasy rather than their selection of the weapon. </p><p>They were dangerous, dangerous enough to trigger my instincts to the limit. </p><p>Almost an hour passed in silence as I watched them, trusting my instincts about the danger they represented. I was sure that they represented the danger against Titania, and I decided to wait until they decided to act, allowing me to ambush them. The way they were dressed suggested that the mage would stay behind. </p><p>Then, my prediction turned to be true as the assassin-looking types suddenly stood up without talking and walked toward the door. Watching the way they moved, I was glad that I didn’t try to attack them, because the grace they displayed suggested that they had a significantly high stat spread. I was lucky that I didn’t attack them. Not because I was afraid of failing to take them down, but I was sure that I couldn’t take them down without making a huge commotion, especially if the mage had the opportunity to trigger the wards. </p><p>Luckily, the assassins have left using the main door, leaving the mage alone. </p><p>I used the shadows of the room to close into the mage, grabbing a dagger reverse. The mage stayed focused on the wards, until I was behind him. The closer I got, the more disgusted I was getting. Something was wrong with the mage, though I didn’t know what. </p><p>Then, without a warning, I slammed the dagger to his temple, trying to deal a blow that would take him down without killing him. </p><p>Unfortunately, after slamming, the response I received was not the one I was looking for. He stumbled a bit, then a flare of magic started to gather. His Constitution was much stronger than I had been expecting, especially for a mage. I slammed the dagger again, this time hard enough to slam him against the wall, and he responded with a flood of arcana magic missiles, traveling toward me in a scary manner. </p><p>I erected a shield to block it as I dashed forward once more, still determined to take him down without killing. </p><p>[-195 Mana]</p><p>Despite the hurried manner he let out of his magic, the resulting spells were much stronger than I had been expecting. His physical stats were strong, but his magical stats were much stronger. Not to the point of eclipsing me, but the simple fact that they were comparable carried many dangerous implications. </p><p>So, I used my speed to the limit, arriving in front of him before he could finish casting his next spell, and slammed my dagger to his heart, stretching my magic to the limit as I did so. The blow itself was strong enough to kill  The impact of the blow slammed him against the wall, a spray of blood spilling from his wound, while a second one spilled out of his mouth, suggesting a deadly blow. </p><p> I jumped forward as I raised my weapon again, ready to lash out. “Don’t make a move, and you might just live,” I said. I put my hand on his body, flooding his body with biomancy energy, but not the healing kind. Instead, I was forcing his body to stop, preventing him from reacting, barely conscious. </p><p>[-912 Mana]</p><p>He collapsed. Then, I used my mana to slip inside his soul space, curious about his exact strength. </p><p>Only to meet with the most disgusting sight I had ever witnessed. </p><p>Soul space was an abstract concept, therefore hard to explain in terms of physical terms, but the easiest way to describe my target was food. A soul space was supposed to be like a lean steak, whole, pristine, colored with occasional marbling of skills and achievement that nonetheless looked natural. </p><p>The soul space of my target could be best described as a poorly-mixed vegetable meatball. It was a cacophony of pieces coming from different sources, barely clamped together with ominously throbbing magical links, crawling as disgusting as an insect nest trying to finish a carcass before hyenas could take their turn. </p><p>There were three things that I noticed immediately. First, the soul space was clearly artificial, and created by a sick mind. Second, despite its disgusting and unstable nature, it was clearly strong. With a glance, I could identify many skills and stats, definitely over level thirty, maybe even over forty. </p><p>However, the third point was more important. The moment my target noticed my intrusion, he triggered a complicated seal in the center of his soul space, and the whole thing started collapsing. </p><p>“Fuck,” I murmured as I took a step back, creating another, even stronger shield around the target to contain the inevitable explosion. He turned into a fine mist of blood mixed with mana, expanding outward while my arcana shield wrapped around, the second layer of earth shield to support. It started cracking, and I started pushing a lot of mana to keep it contained. </p><p>[-1614 Mana]</p><p>[+2 Arcana]</p><p>The explosion finally stopped, and I collapsed, breathing hard. That was closer than I had been hoping. Unfortunately, I didn’t have a lot of time to waste. I had no idea whether the assassins could feel the demise of their teammate, and if they did, whether it would change their strategy. They might try to escape, or even worse, they might decide to take Titania down permanently rather than imprisoning her. And, I wasn’t willing to let her test herself against two assassins of unknown strength when she already exhausted herself against two different monster hordes. </p><p>On the positive side, it wasn’t exactly difficult to follow the assassins. I just needed to follow the disgusting metaphorical sensation spreading from their mutilated soul space. </p><p>After taking the magical gem and dispelling the spell that was driving the monsters to attack the city furiously, of course. Not that it would change a lot of things at this point, every little bit helped. </p><p>As I followed the trail of the assassins, my mind was on the newest mystery I faced. What I had just seen in the soul space of the mage before his death was another huge mystery, one that I suspected that would have been rewarded with achievement if I hadn’t already depleted the power of my unique system without meaning to. </p><p>Still, even without a clue, it wasn’t hard to guess that it was a momentous discovery. There was a group present that was rather capable in terms of manipulating soul spaces. They were not exactly smooth, but considering they were able to send three people for a mission, each strong enough to be a mover and shaker even in the important places like the Capital, or Silver Spires. </p><p>And if they were sending three of them to a mission, combined with their artificial nature, it implied that they might have many more people in matching capabilities. Combine that with their dubious alliance with the necromancers and their courage to openly target both the princess of a royal family and Silver Spires at the same time… </p><p>The implications were not nice… </p><p>I managed to find the assassins as they were skulking in a corner near the walls, watching Titania as she used her light spells against the last few monsters that remained. Apparently, the battle was about to come to an end. No doubt they had moved. </p><p>Under different circumstances, I would have let them take action, but I was afraid of them having collaborators that might attack Titania while I dealt with them. Instead, I decided to be decisive, and once again tapped the city wards, extending the defensive structure around them. </p><p>A minute later, one of the assassins was suddenly alerted, but it was too late. I used a burst of elemental mana to fill the magical moat I created around them with flames, dumping as much mana as I could manage, the plume climbing to the sky. </p><p>[-2612 Mana]</p><p>The cries rose around from the defenders, shocked by the sudden burst of magic. Titania turned toward me as well, so I sent her a magical message. “Don’t worry about the flames. I’ll visit you after you go to your room,” I told her. </p><p>“Focus on the outer defenses, the flame is from the wards,” she cried, following my suggestion despite her shock at my presence, and pulling the focus of the defenders to the walls once again. Meanwhile, I turned my attention back to the assassins, who were having trouble handling the sudden ambush as they tried to get out of the trap created by the wards. </p><p>Unfortunately, it was too late as they were burned by the wards. I used Tantric to slip into the soul space of one of them, only to find a disgusting mess. And once again, it triggered another self-destruct, showing their commitment to keeping their nature hidden. </p><p>Luckily, unlike the previous explosion, I didn’t need to contain it completely. Just channeling it toward the sky to mix the inferno that was already going on had been enough…</p><p>With the assassins dealt in, I left Titania alone on the walls and returned to the safe house, hoping to find some clue from the wards they left around the house… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 30    Experience: 447193 / 465000 </p><p>Strength: 41    Charisma: 53</p><p>Precision: 35    Perception: 37</p><p>Agility: 35     Manipulation: 40</p><p>Speed: 34       Intelligence: 44</p><p>Endurance: 34      Wisdom: 46</p><p>HP: 5370  / 5370\tMana: 4213  / 6600        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Master Subterfuge [97/100]         </p><p>Master Arcana [97/100]        </p><p>Expert Speech [70/75]</p><p>Advanced Craft [50/50]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 21/25]</p><p>[Helga - Level 17/21] </p>",

Her gaze bounced between my face and the ceiling, unable to decide where to look, when her phone, which was sitting on the bedside table, chose that exact moment to ring. </p><p>“It’s Sarah,” I said as I passed it to her rather than declining the call. Her reaction was far too cute for me to do otherwise. However, I was entertained more than I expected when rather than rejecting the call, she pressed the little green icon on the screen. </p><p>“Carrie, where the hell are you?” reached Sarah’s voice from the other side of the phone. Her tone was sharp and domineering. “Your mom just called me to confirm whether we need anything in our little sleepover. Why don’t I know we’re having a sleepover?” </p><p>“S-sorry,” Carrie stammered even as a thick blush covered her body as she forced herself to speak as she processed our current situation. Naked, with my shaft still inside her, rapidly growing back to full size after my climax. “I forget to tell you about it.” </p><p>“That’s not the issue,” she answered, her tone still sharp, but with a protective instinct. “The important thing is, where are you?” </p><p>“I-” she tried to start, only to stammer for a moment, forcing her to start speaking. “I’m with Chad.” She managed to say. </p><p>“Again?” Sarah answered, her panic disappearing completely, replaced by exasperation, though her tone was still sharp. That seemed to be a part of her personality unrelated to the situation, as it wasn’t too different from her attitude when we studied in the library together for a small while. “Your crush on him was cute at first-” she tried to say, only to be interrupted by a shocked gasp of Carrie. </p><p>“Sarah!” she exclaimed. </p><p>“He’s not sitting next to you, is he?” Sarah answered. </p><p>“No,” Carrie answered with a trembling tone. Which, technically, was the truth. I wasn’t sitting next to her. I was hovering above her, with my considerable length hidden inside her wetness, making it harder for her to speak every passing second. </p><p>“Then there’s no problem talking about your little crush and your hopes of getting close to him by helping him study,” Sarah answered condescendingly. “You have to know you can’t get your first kiss by helping him finish his homework.” </p><p>“H-hey,” Carrie stammered. “That’s not what we’re doing.” </p><p>“So, you haven’t gone to his house to study,” Sarah said, her superior tone getting thicker, which was making Carrie blush more and more. I decided to add a little more challenge to my sexy blonde by starting to move, distracting her from her next words. </p><p>“Maybe-” Carrie started heatedly, seemingly angered enough to spill the beans, only to stop as she tried to contain a moan. </p><p>Her little break was enough for Sarah to jump back into the discussion. “Of course you went to do homework,” she commented in confidence. “Sweetie, I know he’s a touch better in shape than other nerdy boys, but that doesn’t mean he has any confidence. You at least need to hint him that you want to see a movie or get a nice dinner if you want to get a kiss before the school year ends,” she commented without bothering to hide her humor, clearly enjoying ribbing her friend. </p><p>“Makes sense, invite me to a date, and maybe you’ll manage to get a kiss,” I whispered softly enough for her phone not to pick while I once again pushed myself into her depths. Which was sufficiently distracting for Carrie, who stayed silent as she tried to contain her moans, while Sarah started to give many recommendations —and not for the first time if the speed she was going through the list was any indicator. </p><p>“That’s enough,” Carrie managed to say, but that took almost a minute to do so, her attention grabbed by the way I was sliding in and out slowly but steadily. “He might come in any moment, I need to go,” she said, unaware of the other implications of her words as she hurried to end the call. </p><p>“So, I might come in any moment,” I said mockingly even as I pushed inside her to remind them about her unintentional slip. “I hope you’re not calling me a quick-shot.” </p><p>“No! Not that! I didn’t-” she started panickedly, showing a potential to go for a long while as her shame drove her, so I chose to extinguish that particular one with another kiss. “Sorry about Sarah,” she said after I finally let her breathe, though I was slowly but repeatedly pushing inside her, keeping her wet but away from a climax. “She means well, but…”</p><p>“She’s a protective friend that doesn’t realize you grew up,” I completed her sentence. While I might be giving Carrie’s initiative more credit than it might deserve, considering the activity we were currently busy with, being generous wasn’t something anyone could fault me for. “But I’m sure you don’t want to waste time talking about Sarah’s misconceptions about your lack of initiative, right?” </p><p>“Right,” she murmured, blushing, which was immediately followed by a gasp as I pushed in her sharply.</p><p>“Excellent, then let’s have some fun,” I said even as my hips quickened. I put my hands on her body, softly caressing her sensitive spots in a way that contrasted greatly with my furious pumping. After all the time we wasted on extended foreplay, I knew exactly how to play her body like a musical instrument. I could use even the most casual touch to make her moan, and what I had been using was far from what could be classified as casual. </p><p>I was determined to make her first time a memorable event. </p><p>Playing with my shy, nerdy blonde was proving to be even more fun than I expected, however, as her hands started to caress my body in response, galvanized by Sarah’s call. I leaned down and pressed my lips against her neck, making her moan gently while I continued to impale her. Her back arched, taking a surprising initiative to grab my hair, pushing me harder against her skin. I couldn’t help but smirk in amusement as I witnessed her develop rougher habits immediately after her first time. I didn’t say anything though, as she was obviously enjoying it, and it would be a lie to say I disliked it. </p><p>Her moans intensified as I moved down. First, I nibbled her collarbone to make her gasp loudly. Then, I arrived at her gloriously round breasts, assaulting her sensitive nipples with my tongue and lips until her moans turned into an unbroken string, leaving her breathless. I chose that exact moment to pull out, leaving her gasping and panting in shock. “What happened?” she managed to ask, dazedly. </p><p>“It’s time to change position,” I reminded her. “Move on all fours, I want to see your beautiful ass while I take you.” She blushed, but that didn’t prevent her from following my direction and coming on all fours, her back arched erotically while her tits dangled down. I pressed my shaft against her entrance, sliding into her core without the slightest resistance. “How does it feel?” I asked even as I grabbed her hair, pulling it as hard as she had been moments ago. </p><p>“Amazing,” she answered as she pushed her hips back to force me even deeper into her. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said even as I picked up speed, thrusting into her aggressively while her moans filled the room once again. “Someone is enjoying the treatment,” I commented mockingly even as my shaft exploded against her bottom again and again. </p><p>“Yes,” she answered, followed by another loud cry as I pushed inside her. “This feels amazing, like I’m filled completely,” she followed. </p><p>“Better than the other position?” I asked, curious about the answer, though it was mostly about making her talk. It was fun to force her to talk while all she wanted to do was to moan. </p><p>“I don’t know,” she moaned, her voice once again showing its shy quality. Apparently, forcing her to talk about the pleasure she was feeling was much more difficult than asking her to give her body for those positions. </p><p>“Oh, really?” I said. “Don’t you have any preference?” I added even as I pulled her hair back, making her gasp while the sound of flesh hitting flesh filled the room. </p><p>“I don’t know, both are nice,” she managed to say. </p><p>“How about this?” I asked as I pulled back, only to leave the bed. I dragged her along as well, of course, until she found herself locked between the wall and my body, her beautiful blue eyes widened in shock. She rose to her toes as I pushed inside her, her tits dangling with the movement. Luckily, my body was more than enough to keep her in place as her feet left the ground and wrapped around my waist, giving me the chance to grab her tits aggressively, making her moan. Her face contorted with a beautiful mixture of shyness, desire, and surrender, tempting me to pump even more aggressively. </p><p>“It seems that you enjoy this one even more.” </p><p>“Shut up,” she murmured, and raised her hands to cover her face, though that did nothing about the tightness of her legs around my waist. </p><p>“Don’t cover your face,” I ordered, rewarding her with a kiss when she pulled her hands away. “Enjoy the moment fully.” They weren’t the most insightful comment, but luckily, Carrie was too distracted by her upcoming orgasm to pay attention to the literary merits of my words. At this point, it was a small miracle that she was coherent enough to listen to my words and respond. </p><p>When I finally captured her lips again. It didn’t take long for her to finally climax. I just continued pumping into her, not giving her a moment to breathe. “It feels … so good,” she gasped dazedly, even when I started walking around the room, my hands digging into her ass to keep her in place. I walked toward the shower, leveraging the advantages of the empty house by walking around naked. But such an incredible moment had its costs, as I was rapidly closing into the point of climax. Giving her a nice creampie was tempting, but it wasn’t the only temptation. </p><p>I finally pulled out of her when we reached the shower, the hot water blasting with full strength, getting rid of our sweat. She collapsed on the floor, and I leveraged the perfect angle to cover her tits with my seed while she just moaned dazedly. Unfortunately, the hot water was quick to wash them away. “Open wide,” I ordered immediately, and she followed without a delay, obediently taking my shaft into her mouth, her tongue creating a delicious impact on my shaft… </p><p>She said nothing, just wrapped her lips around the entirety of my shaft, which was an easy job to do in its flaccid state. But under the assault from her warm mouth, assisted by her clumsy but enthusiastic tongue, it immediately started to grow, making it harder and harder for her to keep a hold. When it was halfway up, she surrendered and pulled back, but it continued its growth, large enough to press against her lips even after she pulled back, her head pressing against the shower wall. </p><p>“It’s too big,” she murmured. </p><p>“You’re not a quitter,” I answered. “You’re an overachiever, and I trust you,” I said, which was enough for her to wrap her lips around my shaft even as I groaned under the massage of the shower. </p><p>Being friends with a nerd was turning out to be significantly more fun than I had been expecting…</p>",

    "content": "<p>It was amusing to watch the expression of dazed arousal on Sapphire’s face, and I was tempted to continue playing with her softly while teasing her about her new habit. </p><p>Unfortunately, that wasn’t as tempting as impaling her mercilessly to cure my throbbing shaft. A flick was enough to reveal my raging erection, then I grabbed her hips and pulled her to my lap, impaling her with one smooth move. Her lack of underwear made the move even more convenient. </p><p>Her beautiful blue eyes widened in shock as my girth invaded her tunnel, stretching it to comfortably allow my presence, though, despite the surprise assault, it had gone unexpectedly smoothly, thanks to her spectacular wetness after the earlier climax. </p><p>“What are you doing-” she tried to gasp, only for me to seal her lips with a searing kiss. The sudden intimacy shocked her even more than my shaft invading her depths, freezing her momentarily even as my tongue invaded her mouth, freely roaming in the depths of her mouth, while my hands nonchalantly gripped her ass cheeks.</p><p>“Marvelous, Sapphire,” I murmured after I pulled back, though my hands moved back and forth, making her move across my shaft. </p><p>Her expression of confusion was simply beautiful. Intellectually, she obviously hated the situation she was in, being fucked once again by a lowly merchant —at least to her knowledge— was bad enough, but doing that while dressed as a slutty maid clearly made it much worse. </p><p>However, carnally, her reaction was the complete opposite. The backlash of her own spells had already triggered her body’s reaction to an amazing degree, but even that was eclipsed by the surprise orgasm, triggered by the spank she had received, unearthing a secret desire. </p><p>“You’re a … a… brute!” she gasped in shock as our eyes met, all the while continuing to impale her. </p><p>“Really, my dear Queen, it that the best insult you can come up with,” I answered, even as I brought one of my hands to her cleavage, pulling hard to rip her costume, freeing one of her tits. Then, I leaned down, kissing the large expanse aggressively enough to leave a hickey behind. </p><p>“I have never denied being a brute, after all. I’m a working man, not a silver-spooned noble. And in my line of work, you either learn to take whatever presented, or you end up as a loser.” I smirked before kissing her again, leaving her mouth open in shock, which was rather amusing considering I was continuously impaling her as I talked. “And with your beautiful lips presented conveniently, how can I resist stealing another taste.” </p><p>She opened her mouth to answer, but at the same time, I brought my hand back to her hips, using it as leverage to increase my speed further. And since her arousal was already to an unbearable point, it wasn’t a surprise when her words disappeared in a chain of moans as she threw her head back. Instead, I lowered my head down, my face disappearing in her cleavage. </p><p>Her hands landed on my shoulders, but surprisingly, she didn’t use it to free herself, instead of using it to balance herself. If I hadn’t watched her desperate masturbation following the events of the previous evening, I might have been surprised with the sudden shift, but with that information, the only thing that surprised me was the quickness of her surrender. Even with all the advantages, I did expect her to resist the call of pleasure for a few more minutes. </p><p>Instead, with every passing minute, she started to get more and more at ease on my lap, moaning louder as my fingers dug deeper into her flesh. At one point, she even grabbed her own costume and pushed it down, removing the last scrap of coverage for her breasts, freeing me to enjoy their spectacular expanse, pale and perky. </p><p>“So, about the business discussion,” I asked mockingly. “Do you want to stop and talk about it, or do you want to leave it after we finish.” </p><p>Her reaction surprised me. I expected her to either accept the opportunity to discuss, using her willpower to suppress her desire, or order me to continue to protect her last scrap of dignity, trying to act like she was in control. So, I was rather shocked when she met her gaze, her blue eyes looking at me beggingly with a weak vulnerability that reminded me of the Princess. Apparently, for all her strength, she wasn’t completely free of the desire to submit. It just took a while to unearth it. </p><p>Pity that she was strong enough to bury that desire when there was sufficient enough time to calm down. </p><p>Luckily, I have a whole night to enjoy her excitement. </p><p>As I pushed inside her repeatedly, enjoying her naked moans, too lost in her pleasure to even ignore the fact that she was dressed as a lowly maid, not reacting —other than letting out delicious moans— as my fingers danced over her ass and her thighs. “Move your hips more enthusiastically,” I reminded her even as I spanked their great expanse. “You’re a dancer, prove just how good of a dancer you are.”  </p><p>“You’re a brute,” she repeated, but that didn’t prevent her hips from picking up speed. </p><p>“Excellent,” I murmured in appreciation. “I can see why the audience loves you. How a hotblooded male could deny the beauty of those hips.” </p><p>She growled in anger, but lost in the flow of the moment. She realized she was getting lost in the moment, but as the pleasure built up more and more, even the slightest objection was getting impossible to achieve. I decided to push even more. </p><p>“That’s enough for this position. Stand up, go toward the bed,” I ordered even as I slapped her ass once again. </p><p>“Right now?” she gasped in shock. </p><p>“Yes, do it,” I ordered, much to her shock. “I want your famous hips dancing in front of me.” </p><p>“As you wish,” she gasped, but she looked extremely put off as she said so. She pulled out, leaving my shaft throbbing freely, still glistening with her juices, while she tried to stand on her trembling legs. She held the nearby chair first, before starting to walk forward the huge bed in the room.</p><p>After a few steps, she managed to stop her legs from trembling, replacing them with a delicious swing. Her skirt was too short to hide her hips during such a move, creating a delicious view, tempting me to follow her. But I stayed on my seat and watched, while she danced toward with deliberate slowness, her aura of seduction peaking. The more she danced, the more confident she looked, believing she was taking back control. </p><p>I was more than happy to disabuse her from that particular notion even as she reached for the bed, about to climb on. “Don’t step on the bed. A maid like you doesn’t deserve to sit on the bed. Just keep your hands on the edge, and bend over,” I ordered even as I stood up, my erection pointing at her glistening entrance. </p><p>“You dare,” she gasped in shock, but that didn’t prevent her from following my order. She leaned against the bed, her elbows on the bed to support her stance, while her legs straightened, the position showing her plump ass in the best possible position. </p><p>“I dare,” I said even as I stood behind her, letting my fingers caress her entrance. “Now, part your legs. I want to fuck you properly.” </p><p>“I’ll make sure you die a painful death,” she gasped, but clearly, it was for her own benefit, allowing her to delude herself that she was still resisting, something her enthusiastic speed as she parted her leg didn’t support. </p><p>I put my hands on her hips with a deliberate slowness before I positioned myself to enter her once more. It wasn’t the first time I was entering her warmth, but bending her in front of a bed like an actual maid taken by her lord felt extremely amazing. I grunted helplessly as I pushed forward, enjoying the way she clamped around.  </p><p>While she moaned helplessly, my hands clutched her hips as I thrust rhythmically into her, trying to touch unexplored depths as every push made my shaft disappear completely, forcing her to reshape with my invasion. “Damn, I still can’t believe how tight you are,” I gasped even as I spanked her ass, every touch making her moan helplessly, driving her to abandon even the fake resistance she tried to use to convince herself. She just moaned. </p><p>I felt hypnotized, pushing inside her again and again, forcing her tits to dangle freely while she hovered over the bed, but not touching other than her elbows. Her ass and thighs jiggled with each thrust as her body moved forward and back in rhythm to my relentless fucking, changing only when I spanked her ass. </p><p>Finally, her arousal hit an unbearable limit. “Oh, yes,” she moaned as I impaled her mercilessly, losing herself in the moment, readily matching my limit whenever I changed it. </p><p>“You love this, don’t you, slut?” I said, enjoying her endless moans. “I bet that for the last decade, you dreamed nothing but a strong man to bend you over just like you deserved. Maybe I should just bend you over your throne to properly teach you.” </p><p>“Please do, sir,” she gasped deliriously, well past her limit to understand the implications of her words. </p><p>I laughed even as I continued to push forward without skipping a beat. “Don’t forget what you promised,” I said. I just said to mock her, but it would be a lie to say that I wasn’t extremely aroused by imagining myself in her throne room, pushing her against her throne, still wearing her crown but nothing else as I repeatedly pumped inside her. </p><p>The rush from that moment, combined with her delicious tightness, was enough to trigger my climax. “Take it, you whore,” I exclaimed as I exploded inside her, once again marking her mine. </p><p>“Yes, fill me,” she gasped deliriously, climaxing at the same time, pushing her ability to stand to the limit. </p><p>Since I was a nice guy, I pulled out and dragged her to the bed. “You deserve a moment to rest.” </p><p>With that, I lay next to her, enjoying the way her expression shifted as the seconds roll into minutes, from pure bliss to a horrifying realization, understanding just how far she let the moment affect her… </p><p>“So,” I said mockingly. “Are you ready to continue our discussion?” </p>",

    "content": "<p>Two weeks passed since the speech, and, surprisingly, being a fake slave wasn’t as bad as I had been expecting. Yes, the days had been filled with endless exercise, followed by disgusting herbal remedies with many helpful but acrid-tasting plants, the stuff that was cheap not because they were harmful, but because no self-respecting noble would ever put them into their mouth. They were still expensive enough to cost weeks of earnings of a normal worker, even above the budget of a normal legionnaire, but considering we were being fattened for eventual combat, it wasn’t exactly surprising.</p><p>Pico was our main trainer, pushing us through a strict training regimen that would have killed the rest of the group if it wasn’t for the daily magical nutrition they received. Every day was the same, whether it was raining, scorching, or windy. After a hearty breakfast, we were summoned to the training field, forced to repeat the same excoriating exercises, trying to break our bodies and rebuild at the same time. </p><p>Even with the magical remedies, it was a dangerous program —for the others, as I had long used to such exercises. Considering the money the school had spent to buy us, it was rather suspicious. I doubted the Ludus had earned their reputation by wasting the talents they had acquired without a reason.  </p><p>I made a point of lasting an hour or two more than the rest, though I didn’t neglect to fake exhaustion toward the end. After all, not only I had been doing similar exercises since my childhood, but also my ascension had increased my physical abilities to the point that what was supposed to be a grueling workout barely qualified as a warm-up. </p><p>Interestingly, however, the exercises were far too familiar to my childhood ones to be a coincidence, suggesting that my grandfather had experience with gladiators. Of course, whether he was related to Ludus Dacicus or one of the other schools I didn’t know, nor I cared too much. It was barely more than an anecdote at this point, after all. </p><p>The real thing that I paid attention to was the condition of the gladiators. Since the repeated magical healing might be dangerous, especially across weeks and months, most gladiators preferred to heal naturally as much as possible. Interestingly, the infirmary was never empty, and more importantly, more than one gladiator had died during their matches. </p><p>It was noteworthy, because according to what I remembered about the discussion of my ‘noble’ peers back in the school, gladiators, especially the established ones, were rarely killed in the arena. After all, every gladiator was a celebrity, and their loss meant disgruntled fans and a loss of interest. The games with death were mostly for prisoners, war criminals —either desertion or victims of political games— or captives from battles too unruly to be used as a slave. </p><p>Proper gladiators weren’t supposed to fall in this frequency. No wonder they were aggressively purchasing new slaves to plug the gap. </p><p>Since I had observed the situation well, I wasn’t surprised —or felt proud unlike my fellow trainees— when Antonius suddenly barged into our training just before noon, declaring we were about to have our first practice with the weapons, declaring that he had been impressed with the dedication we had been showing. </p><p>“Let’s see how well you can fight,” he said even as Pico quickly passed us blunted spears and bucklers, the trademark weapons of the Dacian tradition. “The one that fights the best will earn a great honor to open the spring games, which will happen tomorrow, against the Ludus Matutinus, promoting to full gladiator after the victory.” </p><p>“Lucky boys,” Pico cut in in a rehearsed manner. “If you gain the qualification as a gladiator, it means you don’t have to stay in that small room with the rest of the smelly guys. You’ll get better food, better medical treatment, and most importantly, respect from others.” </p><p>“Not to mention young noble ladies like the gladiators who distinguish themselves in the arena,” cut in one of the assistant trainers, earning some laughter, while Antonius, the leader of the school, sporting a small smile. </p><p>The discussion about these so-called benefits of being the first one to qualify lasted quite a while, which would have been enough to arouse my suspicion even if I hadn’t already understood the situation. The attrition their gladiators were going through was rather obvious to anyone that wasn’t focused on their own torturous training, clearly indicating a ploy against the school. </p><p>I understood that the spring games were supposed to be an important one, and Ludus Matutinus —also known of the school of Bestiaries— was a dangerous opponent. It was one of the four great gladiator schools, with a history equal to Dacian school, and unlike Dacian school, they weren’t struggling under a deliberate combined assault of their biggest competitor and several upstart schools at the same time. So, they had the capital to put together stronger opponents. </p><p>Not to mention, unlike the other schools, they were responsibly providing the fighting animal, meaning they could easily explain any accidents that might befall a Dacian gladiator as a mistake made by a wild animal. I didn’t know which animal or animals they were going to use for the spring games, but I expect it to be supremely dangerous if Antonius was conceding this easily by sacrificing a newcomer to it. </p><p>Well, dangerous to anyone but me. </p><p>It was a bit wasteful for Antonius to use the best of the new slaves he had acquired, but understandable. Even as a sacrifice, he didn’t have the option to throw the fight with a substandard gladiator without hurting the reputation of the school, which would damage it even worse than losing a promising talent. </p><p>Still, I decided to take the opportunity. Spring games, especially against a strong beast from Ludus Matutinus, were the perfect opportunity for me to gain considerable fame in one shot. </p><p>“So, who’s the best among them?” Antonius asked Pico, deliberately loud. </p><p>“He is,” said Pico, pointing toward me, which was an indisputable fact considering I always managed to stay an hour longer in the training field, but that didn’t prevent the others from bristling in dissatisfaction. After all, no warrior wanted to admit their inferiority if possible, not when they defined themselves with their martial talent. </p><p>I just turned then and let out a smug smile, letting a bit of attitude slip in. I needed to show the reckless and arrogant warrior impression as well. </p><p>“Okay, boy, show me,” said Antonius as he gestured me to pick my weapons. Then, he turned to the rest of them. “If anyone disagrees, they can step onto the field and prove it.” </p><p>The strongest one after me, Amatus, lunged forward immediately, a sneer in his face. He had always been looking at me with dissatisfaction, itching to show me my place, but the endless training didn’t leave any strength for him to do so. </p><p>“It’s about time,” he grunted in anger even as he twirled his spear, trying to intimidate me. </p><p>“Did we met before?” I answered mockingly, which was not the best answer, but as far as attacking the fragile ego of a warrior who’s trying to find its place in a completely new situation, it worked excellently. He let out a scary war cry, and charged forward. </p><p>I could have charged forward as well, as I was supremely confident in my strength, but since they were looking for someone to fight against a monster, I decided to show some tactics, just enough to make me a candidate for tomorrow’s fight. Of course, I needed not to show off too much, in case they decided to actually train me extensively as a trump card. </p><p>I took a step back with my right foot before shifting my weight to the left, ready to support my shield for it, taking the simplest defensive posture I watched the other gladiators use during the training. Amatus’ spear slammed with full speed to my buckler, only to be deflected easily. I swung my own spear simultaneously, fast enough to unbalance him, but not fast enough that he couldn’t use his own shield to protect himself. </p><p>Still, he stumbled back a couple of steps, while I received a nod of approval from Antonius. He tried to look like a proud teacher, which I promptly ignored. After all, he was using me, and I was using him —not that he was aware of the latter part. Everything else was just window dressing. </p><p>“Careful while charging,” Pico barked at Amatus, making him grumble in dissatisfaction. </p><p>Amatus started walking around me, looking for an opportunity. “Are you continue standing, coward?” he growled, trying to goad me into action, but just smiled at him smugly. This time, Amatus proved himself smarter than I gave credit for, and dashed forward just after opening his mouth like he was about to deliver another insult. </p><p>Too bad I was ready for his cheap tricks. I once again used my buckler to push him back, but when I noticed his left arm tensing in preparation for a blow, I charged forward instead, forcing close combat, which was rarely the best move when using a spear. </p><p>He was quick to dismiss that as well when I swung my shield, trying to duck under my swing, therefore, he was unprepared for my knee, landing in his chest. He collapsed, breathless. </p><p>“Not bad,” said Antonius even as Pico gestured the next one, ordering him to attack before giving me a chance to catch my breath. Apparently, they made their choice, and were trying to make sure that I wouldn’t embarrass them. I decided to show off my endurance and evasion without being too suspicious, and started dodging and weaving around the assault of my opponent, which, admittedly, wasn’t exactly difficult. </p><p>Still, after five minutes of chase, I put him down as well, while making a show of breathing loudly, trying to convince them that I was at my limit. </p><p>I expected Antonius to order the next one, instead, he asked me to stand. “Ready position, fifty stabs,” he ordered, and I followed that, trying to do a good approximation of a tired yet stubborn warrior. “Dodge,” he ordered after ten even as he swung his own spear to my head. I dodged, but let it leave a bruise on my temple. After all, I needed to be strong enough to make a good showing, but not strong enough that my supposed loss was a grave danger to the school. </p><p>“Not bad,” he said, before turning to Pico. “He’s the one that will fight tomorrow, make sure that he gets </p><p>“Understood, sir,” answered Pico. “What about the name he’ll fight.” </p><p>“Hmm, since he’s such a strong warrior, we need to find a good name for him. How about Peirous, one of the ancient Thracian kings that fought on the side of the Trojans.” </p><p>“A good name, sir. It has been a long while since that name was used, and this boy deserves it. Strong, yet patient. A kingly bearing, I would say.” Once again, it felt like a show to encourage me, like they weren’t planning to use me as a sacrificial chip. </p><p>“Excellent,” Antonius said. “Boy, from the moment you step on the arena, you’ll be known as Peirous. Be proud.” With that, he turned and left, leaving Pico to train me. </p><p>“Right, you lot!” Pico shouted as he looked at them. “Take a spear and shield and stand in a line in front of the training posts!” They followed his order, and started receiving basic instructions from one of the junior trainers. Meanwhile, Pico faced me. “Boy, have you ever went to boar hunt with your spear?” </p><p>“Often, sir,” I said. </p><p>“Good, then at least I won’t have to start from nothing,” he said, though from his desperation, I could easily guess that I wouldn’t be facing a lowly boar tomorrow, but something much more dangerous. He started showing me several simple yet showy moves, one that would be rather useless in terms of clinching victory against a dangerous beast because they lacked the leverage, but flashy enough to make a good showing for the audience. </p><p>I looked forward to it… </p>",

    "content": "<p>It was almost dawn when I left Avaida’s room, leaving her exhausted in her bed, her arm wrapped around Carla, who had joined us later in the night, only to collapse earlier than Aviada, her experience and her lack of endurance showing themselves. </p><p>Aviada was rather competitive, after all. </p><p>She had a faint smile on her face as I closed the door, leaving her alone, not that it was a shocking thing. After all, not only she had experienced a spectacularly enjoyable evening, but also she had managed to gain four levels in one evening, which was a rather considerable boost to her strength, helping her to progress her swordsmanship potential significantly. </p><p>Unfortunately, I didn’t have the luxury of sleeping for half a day, as I still had two girls to visit, Marianne and Titania, not to mention I still wanted to go and check up with Helga and Cornelia just in case. </p><p>Infiltrating the faculty to discover their mission location hadn’t been particularly difficult. A simple disguise, assisted by a couple of illusion spells, and the domineering attitude of a commander, I was able to learn their location as well as some of the latest reports about the monster horde movements. Luckily, it turned out that they were in the same location, reducing my travel obligations by one, which, at this point, I appreciated quite a bit. </p><p>However, not all was well, because according to the reports, Titania had just managed to destroy a horde while they had discovered a second horde that was traveling toward her location. It didn’t take a genius to understand their plan, trying to tire her before ambushing. However, despite being such a transparent ploy, it was likely to work due to her direct approach to combat. </p><p>With the air elemental mount, it didn’t take long for me to arrive at the city Titania was posted in. When I came near the town, the sun was just rising, but it wasn’t the only bright thing on the horizon. Occasional bursts of bright explosions littered the horizon as well, familiar applications of light magic. </p><p>The reason for it got clear the closer to the walls. The town was surrounded by a monster horde, one that was several times bigger than the one I had to deal with. Still, it wasn’t enough to take down Titania when she had the advantage of a well-fortified location, not even if she had already had handled a previous horde.  </p><p>As I got even closer to get a better idea about the composition of the horde, however, I realized the enemies using a smarter approach than I had expected. The horde that was facing the city carried a mixture of elemental natures, but a great number of them were bulky animals, thick-hide elephants and rock rhinos in particular. I wasn’t able to detect the leading monster, but the skewed nature of the horde suggested that it was planned. Very few of those animals had the ability to climb over the walls or take down the defenders, which made their initial assault less dangerous, but also, meant that exterminating them required a great deal of magical power. </p><p>It wasn’t like ignoring them an option as well. Ultimately, those monsters could breach city walls —despite all the enchantments that protected it— in less than half a day, forcing the defenders to expand their full capabilities. </p><p>They were trying to tire Titania rather than trying to take her down, which meant they had already planned a tertiary assault to take her down, and just waiting until she was exhausted. A nice tactic, strong in its simplicity, because even if Titania noticed that, there was little she could do against it. She couldn’t just abandon the town to her fate, as without her, there was no chance for the defenses to hold, and while calling reinforcements was an option, considering the distance between the town and the school, it would have been too late for the reinforcements to arrive. </p><p>Curious about a possible undead assault, I used biomancy to check the immediate surroundings of the town, only to find no sign of an undead presence. Unfortunately, that was far from conclusive. There was a limit to my biomancy detection, especially since I want to stay hidden, meaning I had to limit the impact. Also, the defensive wards of the town were fully activated, interfering with my spell greatly. If there were any undead inside the town, it would have been hard to detect.</p><p>Since there was no immediate follow-up assault waiting for the defenders, I was tempted to rush forward, a dagger in hand, calling infernos with every breath, but that would make our mysterious opponents abandon the last leg of their plans. Plans that I was yet to discover. </p><p>However, I couldn’t just slip inside the town easily this time. While the defenses might be weaker than Silver Spires, it was rather hard to sneak into a city when the walls were filled with citizen-militia, armed with bows, javelins, and the occasional siege weapons, while the wards were currently at full activation.</p><p>Not impossible, though. Just hard. </p><p>A simple earth spell pushed me fifty feet below the ground, and I started traversing toward the city —and destroying the tunnel behind me, as there was no need to alert my opponents— slowly and steadily, making no crack. </p><p>The walls were not the only protection of the city, of course, the defensive wards spread below the city as well, to protect it from the underground threats of giant worms and other underground threats. Luckily, while those defenses were strong, they were not exactly elegantly crafted, allowing me to bypass them after a minute of fiddling —and that was only because those wards were in full alert state, forcing me to expand more focus than necessary, mostly not to alert any mage that might be observing the performance of the wards. </p><p>[+1 Arcana]</p><p>The resulting improvement was rather welcome, confirming that the skill improvements were still not affected by the snag I had been dealing with. I didn’t have a whole lot of skills to maximize at this point, but still, every single bit counted on the road to supremacy. </p><p>A couple of minutes later, I burst out in one of the basements after using biomancy to make sure it was empty. Most citizens were on the walls, doing their best against the horde, and the people with limited combat capabilities were in the emergency shelters, leaving most buildings empty. </p><p>The streets were similarly empty, allowing me to walk toward Titania with no issues. </p><p>As I moved closer to her, I was simultaneously using my biomancy to detect any possible undead presence. A hidden assault from inside the walls just as the defenders were on the peak of the exhaustion would have given the best result, but surprisingly, I could detect no undead presence. </p><p>However, they wouldn’t waste a second monster horde to exhaust Titania if they didn’t have any ulterior motive. The question was, what was their aim. Maybe they were trying to force me to come out, as after killing several death knights of Zokras the Eternal, I likely earned an important position in their list of people to get rid of. People who became liches were not usually known for their saint-like patience and forgiveness, and I doubted that after staying in that state long enough to be titled Eternal, Zokras’ mentality had developed in a positive direction.</p><p>The lack of undead was not a proof against their involvement either, as they clearly have more than one spy in the faculty, and the recent betrayal of the ranger I had watched was another evidence of their long reach. It was hard to guess their exact plan this time without knowing the full extent of their tools.</p><p>However, as I walked closer, I started to feel the familiar presence of chaotic mana, giving me a familiar feeling, coming from a nearby building, even stronger than the one carried by the ranger that had been tragically killed by the monsters he had been summoning. I assumed that it was stronger because they wanted it to be effective through the walls. </p><p>As I paid attention, I could feel several subtle alert wards layered on every door and window of the building, even the ceiling, suggesting that they would be able to react if that was discovered. The wards they used were significantly more complicated than ones around the town, revealing the presence of at least one master arcanist among them. </p><p>Interestingly, the wards themselves were quite unfamiliar, most of them not matching anything I had discovered in the library. It might be a creative innovation, like Helga creating completely new work immediately, but that didn’t seem to be the case. The more I examined it, the more structured it felt. It was hard to pinpoint the exact reason, but I could feel my brain itch, like a painter taking the first glance at a counterfeit painting. </p><p>“Hmm,” I murmured even as I continued to examine the structure. A minute later, I realized the exact reason for my suspicions. While the individual nodes were built to perfection, all the flaws were concentrated on the merger points, suggesting that the mage failed to perfectly assess the environmental details of the building perfectly. It wasn’t a huge flaw by any means, but compared to the perfection of the individual pieces, it was very noticeable. </p><p>The problem came from my utter inability to recognize the theoretical basis of the nodes. It didn’t resemble anything I had seen in the library, or around the school even the slightest bit. And it wasn’t just a slight difference. Some of the fundamental mana principles were completely different, to a level that I wasn’t able to deduce their implications with a glance. I actually had to sit down and work for hours to decipher the structure if I wanted to slip inside those wards. </p><p>Considering my stats, it was rather impressive.</p><p>Moreover, none of the defensive wards in the necromancer base had anything that matched it, suggesting that whoever constructed it might not be directly related to Zokras and his ilk. After all, if they had access to better defensive structures, they would have used them in their base, at least to defend their most sensitive locations. If their ritual to destroy the dragon had relied on those arcana wards, I doubted that I could have broken them with the ease I had displayed. </p><p>I felt that I finally had the tail of the mysterious third party that gifted the necromancers with their monster hordes. </p><p>Since it was such a big issue, I decided to infiltrate the location. I moved a bit, sinking underground as I did so, a smile on my lips. While the defensive wards they had established were spectacular, it seemed that they stopped after touching the city’s defensive structure, relying on it to defend the basement. A defense that I had bypassed with absolutely no challenge earlier. </p><p>I was more than willing to abuse their oversight…</p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 30    Experience: 447193 / 465000 </p><p>Strength: 41    Charisma: 53</p><p>Precision: 35    Perception: 37</p><p>Agility: 35     Manipulation: 40</p><p>Speed: 34       Intelligence: 44</p><p>Endurance: 34      Wisdom: 46</p><p>HP: 5370  / 5370\tMana: 3123  / 6600        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Master Subterfuge [97/100]         </p><p>Master Arcana [95/100]        </p><p>Expert Speech [70/75]</p><p>Advanced Craft [50/50]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 21/25]</p><p>[Helga - Level 17/21] </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Oh, really, how are you going to do that?” Aviada smirked as she looked at me, her eyes flashing with a provocative kind of anger, one that needed to be extinguished properly to remind her of the place she deserved. It seemed that the domination she employed on Carla had been enough for her to forget what she deserved. </p><p>Or, she was deliberately pushing the border to galvanize me into action. Not that any problem with it if that was the case. Fucking her into submission again was a rather pleasurable activity, after all.  </p><p>“Do you still need a demonstration?” I asked mockingly, but before she could answer, I lashed forward, not as fast as I could do, but still faster than she could react, and this time, I grabbed her shirt and used that to tie her hands, reinforcing its texture with magic as I did so. </p><p>[-23 Mana]</p><p>“Do you think that’ll hold me?” Aviada snorted in confidence, only to realize no matter how much effort she put, it was impossible for her to rip it off. </p><p>“I believe that it might work,” I answered smugly even as I grabbed her shoulder, preventing her from standing up. Of course, that little play wasn’t enough to break her desire to be the dominant one. She displayed her flexibility by managing to throw a kick from her position. </p><p>I grabbed it easily. </p><p>“Is that all you can do?” I asked smugly, which caused her anger to flare. “I can understand if you change your mind and ask for a reprieve. After all, how much can you handle as a weak little girl?” </p><p>“Never,” she countered swiftly, but her anger was unable to conceal her increasing desire. </p><p>“Really,” I said as I pushed her back and put her legs together, before using Carla’s discarded top to tie them up as well, effectively leaving her helpless. “Even if I decide to torture you?” </p><p>“Do your worst!” she challenged, her excitement impossible to hide. </p><p>“Really,” I said as I hovered over her. “Are you sure you can handle my worst?” </p><p>“Of course,” she murmured, but her eyes widened as she wiggled in her place. The reason, the little Biomancy trick I cast her moments ago, enhancing her sensitivity greatly while preventing her from climaxing. Not the first time I was employing a similar trick on her, but since Aviada was an exceptionally rebellious submissive, it wasn’t shocking that she had forgotten its implications. </p><p>But despite the impression her straightforward personality might give, she wasn’t stupid, her eyes widening in remembrance as I caressed her inner thigh gently, injecting her with unbelievable pleasure. “Oh, are you really sure you can handle my worst? It looks like you’re having second thoughts.” </p><p>“No!” she exclaimed, her tone sharp despite her expression disagreeing with the message. She might have realized her mistake, but she was far too prideful to admit defeat this early. </p><p>“As you wish,” I said as I leaned forward, letting my breath fall on her neck, which was rather unbearable with her increased sensitivity, making her tremble. “Domination is such an interesting concept,” I murmured gently even as my hand explored her inner thigh gently. “It’s not about strength or power, but control. A touch here, a caress there, and soon, it allows to unearth the true submissive in the heart of even the most willful fighter, don’t you agree?” </p><p>“I’m not submissive,” she rapidly answered. </p><p>I chuckled even as I let my hand climb up to her wetness. “Oh, really? Then, why are you so wet after being tied down, helpless and under my mercy?” </p><p>That triggered her rebellion once more, making her struggle to get out of her bonds, only to fail spectacularly. At this point, even a simple spell from me couldn’t be resolved with pure strength, especially without any leverage. Moreover, the more she twisted, the more her pleasure built up thanks to her enhanced sensitivity. Soon, she was helplessly moaning even as she struggled, the objective of her struggle changing, searching for the climax. </p><p>I just stood back, watching her naked body writhe, which was a spectacular view. The naked body of Carla, exhausted after the spectacular treatment she had just received, made the view even better. </p><p>It took a while for Aviada to notice my other trick. “You didn’t!” she gasped in horror. I just smirked. “You’re a monster,” she stammered in anger, her confidence replaced with horror. </p><p>“Didn’t you just tell me that you can handle my worst?” I said with a sigh. “Such an unreliable partner. Still, I’m a merciful man. You can just admit that you can’t handle it, and maybe beg for a while, and I’ll dispel the spell. Alright?” </p><p>“Not a chance,” she answered. “You can never take me down with magic!” Still, it was proof of our growing relationship that she was actually getting aroused by the application of magic rather than just being repulsed, despite her believing that magic was weakness. Though, maybe it was about me already proving my strength, leaving no doubt about who was stronger, therefore making her more receptive to some magical seasoning. </p><p>“As you wish,” I said, and grabbed another piece of cloth, this time using it as a blindfold, which made her gasp in panic. It was a good sound on her. </p><p>Wrapped in complete darkness, her gasps of arousal were enhanced as I dragged my hand over her body, the sensation of arousal enhanced more than she could handle. </p><p>The naked, writhing body of Aviada was a delicious sight, tempting me to skip the treatment and take her directly, but I managed to keep myself contained, no matter how much her full breasts danced as she rocked her body while I caressed her tight stomach.  </p><p>“Any change of mind?” I asked even as I let my hands climb higher, caressing the underside of her perky tits. </p><p>“Never,” she gasped, but I could hear that her tone was getting weaker, more indecisive, flinching every time my breath fell on her skin. </p><p>“It’s hard to resist without seeing, is it?” I asked even as I flicked her nipple before raising my hand, only to caress her neck a second later. “Trying to resist without knowing where the hit is going to come, leaving you helpless…” This time, she didn’t even answer, just let out a desperate moan, signaling that her arousal was quickly going of control. </p><p>I maintained the assault for another minute, teasing her sensitive spots in a random order, making her moan helplessly while she writhed against her constraints, desperately trying to get rid of her blindfold, getting more and more aroused as the time went. </p><p>“Can you still handle our little game?” I whispered into her ear, enjoying the way her back arched the moment my breath fell on her neck, making her twitch helplessly. “Or are you going to surrender?” </p><p>“Surrender…” she murmured softly, barely audible. </p><p>“Sorry, it wasn’t clear, would you mind repeating it?” I asked, even as I caressed her tits gently once more, pushing her arousal even deeper. </p><p>“Please,” she uttered, louder. </p><p>“Please, what?” I countered. “Be more clear about what you want, sweetie.” </p><p>She didn’t appreciate my intentional obstinateness, but that wasn’t enough to actually change her mind, not when she was hanging on with the skin of her teeth, with her only hope to release the tension blocked magically. “Please, let me cum,” she begged. </p><p>“And, have you been a good girl, enough to deserve mercy?” </p><p>“Yes,” she gasped, only to receive a hard slap on her breast, leaving a pink mark as it exploded loudly. </p><p>“Really? Even after almost letting my secret slip several times, forcing me to intervene,” I said, like the way I had intervened was a great sacrifice and not something that amused me greatly. </p><p>“You can trust Carla-” she started, only to receive another spank. </p><p>“That doesn’t mean you can just decide it on your own,” I warned her even as I twisted her nipple, enjoying her resulting moans. “Your sin is grave, but you’re lucky that I’m feeling merciful. One little punishment, and I will be ready to forgive you.” </p><p>“Thank you,” she gasped. “Please let me cum.” </p><p>“After the punishment,” I reminded her. </p><p>“That wasn’t the punishment?” she asked, followed by a moan as I twisted her nipple. </p><p>“No, sweetie, that was just the setup,” I said even as I climbed on the bed. ”The punishment is just starting. Open your pretty mouth.” </p><p>“You can’t,” she started, which was exactly the opportunity I needed to push my shaft inside her mouth, but I stayed back to tease her back even more.</p><p>“Well, if you’re saying that you can’t handle Carla’s punishment-” I said mockingly, only for her to interrupt me. </p><p>“I can handle that, of course!” she stated. Her pride might allow her to be submissive to me due to her infuriation with my abilities, but the same didn’t apply to admitting to a weakness compared to her friend, even in significantly disadvantaged circumstances.</p><p>“Excellent,” I said even as I grabbed her body and lifted her up, only to slam her against the wall, earning a moan of shocked pleasure, signaling that she was approaching the point of no return. But she had no one to but herself, paying the cost of her loose lips. </p><p>I didn’t bother kissing her, just pulled back a bit, and her trembling legs failed to carry her weight. I grabbed her tied hands and lifted them over her head even as I pushed my shaft against her lips, easily passing the first line of resistance created by her lips. </p><p>Keeping her hands up with one hand, I pushed my hips forward, knocking the entrance of her throat, earning a moan simultaneously. Meanwhile, my other hand was still exploring her body even if I had to reach down a little, squeezing her tantalizing tits. </p><p>She tried to mewl obediently, her combative instincts long disappeared under the torturous dominance of pleasure. That only made me hornier though. I started pushing forward viciously, getting savage satisfaction from her drunken moans that massaged my conveniently located shaft. </p><p>It felt good to have Aviada, one of the most unruly warriors in the school, and a veritable powerhouse, moaning under the dominance of my shaft helplessly. It was not without a benefit for her, of course, as I used the opportunity to deploy more and more mana into her mouth, leveraging the mana regeneration perk that was triggered earlier to increase the active count from two to three. </p><p>[-1542 Mana]</p><p>I looked down, enjoying her otherwise pale cheeks blushing further and further while her eyes lost their focus, to a point of unable to make eye contact. She even moaned when I pulled out to allow her to breathe, only to slap her cheek with my thickness, creating a delicious thumping sound. Miraculously, Aviada just mooned in response. Signaling that my delicious ploy of dominance was getting a bit too overwhelming. </p><p>It was certainly novel for her to accept whatever I was dishing without a complaint, obediently accepting it. Not wanting to waste such an opportunity, I guided it to her lips once more, this time to be gobbled with enthusiasm. Her mouth parted wide, allowing my invasion without the slightest resistance. </p><p>A groan escaped my mouth even as I pushed harder and harder, slipping a hand behind her head to prevent her head from hitting against the wall, while pulling her hair in the process. She accepted my presence deeper as I pushed, into her throat almost immediately. </p><p>Her eyes widened as her nose pressed against my skin, pushed to the limit, tears flowing out of her eyes. Despite that, her moans continued to escape —and continued to be suppressed by my shaft lodged deep in her throat. </p><p>Soon, she was choking, gagging, and gurgling at the same time, pushing her ability to resist to the limit. Which, admittedly, rather enjoyable to watch as well as to feel. With her wrists bound, she didn’t have any chance to resist, of course, but the fact that she was yet to make any move toward that was the proof of just how far she had sunk into the throes of pleasure. </p><p>All the while, I continued to use the opportunity to transfer mana, both to strengthen her soul space and to bequeath her more experience. </p><p>[-3316 Mana]</p><p>I enjoyed her warm mouth and tight throat for several more minutes before I decided to show mercy. “Punishment complete,” I said, enjoying the way her eyes widened even as I brushed her cheek gently, dispelling the spells on her, her bindings falling simultaneously with the spell that prevented her from climaxing. </p><p>Not that she was in a mood to pay attention to that, not when she was too distracted by the orgasm that hit her with all the strength of a rabid dragon. In a show of mercy, I pulled my shaft out of her, choosing to spray her face and her tits rather than forcing her to swallow, all the while, she trembled helplessly, the only reason she was able to stay upright was the presence of the cold wall behind her, preventing her from collapsing. </p><p>Still, impressively, she was physically capable enough not to collapse, though it was a near miss. I decided to give her an opportunity to catch her breath before starting another round, to help her level up with no ulterior motives. </p><p>We still had quite a bit of time until morning… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 30    Experience: 447193 / 465000 </p><p>Strength: 41    Charisma: 53</p><p>Precision: 35    Perception: 37</p><p>Agility: 35     Manipulation: 40</p><p>Speed: 34       Intelligence: 44</p><p>Endurance: 34      Wisdom: 46</p><p>HP: 5370  / 5370\tMana: 3123  / 6600        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Master Subterfuge [97/100]         </p><p>Master Arcana [95/100]        </p><p>Expert Speech [70/75]</p><p>Advanced Craft [50/50]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 21/25]</p><p>[Helga - Level 17/21] </p>",

    "content": "<p>I could feel Anna trembling as her body squeezed between mine and the wall, her furious flow of thoughts reflected into her eyes as she tried to come up with an excuse for the position she was in. </p><p>Considering the position she had been caught in, however, an excuse was not forthcoming. Her lips parted open several times, only for them to close immediately after. “I’m waiting for the explanation,” I said with a smirk. </p><p>“I…” she stammered, but at that moment, she remembered the extent her clothing was lacking. A cute little yelp escaped her mouth as she put one arm around her chest —which provided rather scant coverage considering the size of her breasts— while using the other to cover her crotch with more considerable success. </p><p>“You…” I repeated, enjoying the opportunity to finally confront her on her naughtiness. Unfortunately, the growing panic on her face dissuaded me from pushing the topic too much, afraid of her panic growing to an uncontrollable level. Instead, I continued in a calm tone. “So, did you have fun?” </p><p>Her reply came stammering. “W-what?” </p><p>“I said, did you have fun?” I repeated, making sure to keep my smile wide enough to be visible in the dimness of the room. She said nothing, still trying to adapt to the sudden change of pacing. As she tried to come up with an answer, I shuffled a bit, which brought our faces even closer. As the distance between our lips dwindled, her lips parted apart automatically, her body under the control of her desire rather than her mind. </p><p>She waited, her lips ready for a kiss. Only after several long seconds, stretching away, she realized that our lips were not touching, and I was still waiting for a response. “I …” she murmured, before her eyes brightened with a sudden realization. “I’m drunk,” she jolted out enthusiastically. </p><p>“Oh, really?” I said, my smirk widening just as I closed in the distance, and pressed my lips against hers, letting my tongue ravage her mouth in a short, yet heated assault. It wasn’t the first time we were sharing a kiss, but considering the location of the kiss, as well as our current lack of clothing, it felt completely different. When my tongue slipped into her mouth, she readily accepted it, too shocked to put up a resistance. When I pulled back, Anna was gasping in shock, reinforced by a great amount of reawakened arousal. “Weird, I don’t get any taste of alcohol,” I said. </p><p>She froze, not just because I forcefully confronted her lie, but also the exact method I had chosen to confront her. “I should leave,” she stammered. A very deliberate wording, I noted in amusement. She didn’t say that she wanted to leave, or even she was feeling uncomfortable, but she chose to say that she should leave. Considering her intelligence and her talent for language, there was no chance it was a coincidence. </p><p>Moreover, she didn’t move even the slightest bit —well, her legs were moving she rubbed them against each other, but that was for a very different purpose than trying to get away. As a proud honors student, she definitely should leave, but the same didn’t apply to the innocent Anna, who was just discovering her sexuality. </p><p>If it was another girl, I would have teased her by daring her to leave, but under the circumstances, I decided against it. She was fragile enough to misinterpret such action as genuine rejection, and I doubted whether she could handle being sent away from the first bed she found herself naked, despite rather dubious circumstances that led to it. “No,” I said. “You need to stay.” </p><p>“W-why?” she asked, stammering. </p><p>Rather than answering immediately, I caught her lips again. This time, her tongue joined the fray, though a bit hesitant. “That should be sufficient as an answer, right?”</p><p>“But, after what I did tonight…” she whispered, letting her words linger.</p><p>“Well, tonight, and two previous nights,” I countered, wanting to rip the band-aid as soon as possible. And, considering the likely next step, I didn’t want to have lain between us. </p><p>“You were awake,” she gasped in shock. </p><p>“Honey,” I said gently. “It’s highly unlikely for a man to continue sleeping while receiving a hand job from a set of beautiful, silky fingers,” I said, grabbing her hand to highlight my words —and if by pulling her hand away, I revealed her beautiful breasts to my view once more, it must be completely coincidental. Then, I smirked and added. “Or, while receiving a furious lap dance for the better part of an hour.” </p><p>The last remark made her blush intensely. “Sorry,” she murmured, closing her eyes. </p><p>I chuckled before kissing her once more. “There’s nothing to be sorry for, sweetie,” I said after pulling back. “I would have stopped you if I was unhappy with it,” I said, ignoring the part I deliberately tempted her to do it. “Still, I wouldn’t recommend it to use it on someone else. You don’t need anything else than just asking, you’re too beautiful for it to fail.” </p><p>“Right,” she said with a snort, her lack of self-confidence rearing its head instantly. </p><p>This time, my smile was neither calm, nor kind. No, it displayed my hunger as I shifted my position. I grabbed her other hand and pinned her under me, her beautiful body naked underneath me while my shaft pressed against her stomach, throbbing in anticipation. “You are a beautiful girl, Anna,” I said sincerely, colored with my burning arousal. After all, I had been suffering under her relentless teasing for a long while. Ultimately, as a man, there was a limit to my resistance, and the said resistance was spending the last scraps of power, its last outpost under siege, surrounded and ready to be slaughtered. </p><p>“Really?” she whispered, the tone of hopefulness suggesting just how badly she felt about her poor self-perception, unaware that it was her poor fashion choices combined with her domineering focus on her studies that kept the handsome boys away. </p><p>“Do you want me to prove it to you?” I whispered throatily, and when she nodded, I leaned down to deliver another kiss. This time, however, rather than latching on her lips domineeringly, I left a fleeting kiss on her cheek, followed by another kiss on her gentle jawline, my hands still around her wrists, pinning her in place. “Your face reminds me of an innocent fairy sunbathing on a flower, innocent yet exquisite, ethereal like a story…” </p><p>I was aware that I could push forward with no problem. She was both aroused and confused, meaning she would accept my presence immediately, allowing me to attain immediate success. Instead, I moved with deliberate slowness as I kissed her cheeks as I whispered several compliments, every kiss bringing me just a sliver lower. I trailed down her jawline, the kiss count well into two digits I arrived at her neck, every kiss making her tremble in anticipation. “Your neck reminds me the elegance of a swan, fair and gentle, yet tempting me to spoil it by my mark,” I added, kissing hard enough to leave a hickey, which made her moan, before I continued leaving a trail of feather-light kisses, occasionally breaking the monotony of my downward trail by moving left and right, even backtracking occasionally as I educated myself about her most sensitive spots. </p><p>“Are you convinced yet that I find you attractive?” I whispered as I finally arrived at her collarbone, leading to her cute shoulders, pristine white thanks to her habit of wearing long-sleeved shirts. “Or should I continue describing the beauty of your spectacular body?”  </p><p>“Please,” she whispered needily, her voice trembling with her unmet desire, but also with wondrous awe.  </p><p>I continued my trail for more, not speaking until I finally arrived at the valley between her breasts, my lips finally caressing the flawless texture of her breasts. “Your breasts are perfection itself, begging to be worshipped slowly,” I said as I moved slowly toward the center, but creating a large, loose spiral in the process just to extend her delicious torture further. “And I better worship them properly.” </p><p>“Please. I can’t last much longer-” she started, trying to beg, only to be interrupted by a moan when I finally captured her rock-hard nipple between my lips, giving her a completely new taste. After observing her for three straight evening visits, I wasn’t surprised by the sensitivity of her breasts, making her moan uncontrollably whenever my tongue joined the fray. She was loud enough to make me glad that we were camping in the middle of nowhere. </p><p>My lips stayed on her breasts for several minutes, and for that duration, she never managed to utter more than two words without being interrupted by a moan, a brush of my tongue enough to kill any statement she wanted to utter. </p><p>“Please, I need you,” she begged again and again, but only after I moved even lower on her naked body —not without a great struggle—  kissing her stomach repeatedly. She was not unaffected, on the contrary, every kiss made her tremble helplessly, showing just how close she was to a climax, but it hadn’t awakened the mindless pleasure her sensitive breasts did earlier. It was alright, as I intended for her to calm down —for a given value of calmness— before I moved to the final prize. </p><p>“Damn, you’re so wet,” I murmured in fascination as I realized just how drenched my bed was as I tortured her over the edge, her sweetness creating a thick and delicious layer of smell. </p><p>“Yes, I am,” she moaned, but it was a different type of moan. Unlike the others, it didn’t shake with a lack of confidence, carrying the flavor of a question. Instead, it was sharp and needy, confident in her need. It seemed that torturing her with pleasure while showing just how attractive I found her was helping her confidence. I didn’t know whether it would last after the climax, but for this particular fleeting moment, it wasn’t very important. “Now, please help me!” </p><p>“As you wish, Anna,” I said, uttering her name deliberately before I let my tongue caress her entrance, her sweetness assaulting my taste buds. She moaned in pleasure, only to cut short when I shifted just a bit, and biting her inner thigh gently rather than diving aggressively. Her whimper was even tastier than her earlier gasps of climax. There was something special in knowing I was the one orchestrating it, rather than being a passive participant. </p><p>“Are you turned on?” I asked, which might be the most redundant question I had ever uttered, as I was presented by a number of irrevocable evidence, each more iron-clad than the last. </p><p>“Yes,” she moaned desperately, the pleasure overwhelming her mind steadily. </p><p>“Why?” I asked after I let my tongue brush her entrance before once again focusing on her inner thighs. </p><p>“Because of you,” she moaned as she tightened her legs around my shoulders, twitching helplessly. “You’re so kind, and you listen. More importantly, you see me, not just another nerd. I can’t help it.” </p><p>“You naughty girl,” I murmured, as I let my hands squeeze her wrists. “So, you like my kindness. What would you do if I let your hands go, then? Pull me up for a talk, where we can share our gentleness with a cup of coffee? Talk until the first rays of morning.” </p><p>I knew the answer even as I uttered. If I asked the same question earlier, she might have actually taken me on that suggestion, trying to establish an emotional relationship. But, on the edge of a climax, being tortured for quite a while, her reaction was more visceral. “Fuck no,” she moaned. “I’ll grab your hair and trap you there until you suffocate,” she moaned, her own words triggering another reaction as I felt her thighs locking around my head. I let her hands go, and she followed her commitment, clamping around my hair to push me down hard. </p><p>Finally giving me an excuse to shift from sweet and gentle to sexy… </p><p>“Oh, really,” I whispered as I let my hot breath brush her wetness before I delved deep once more, my tongue dancing aggressively. “You’re saying that you’re going to act like a brute and force me to serve you if I take it slow,” I added after I pulled back, but this time, rather than tasting her arousal, I started kissing her inner thighs, torturing her with pleasure. </p><p>“Please,” she begged as her hands tightened around the bed covers, pulling them wildly. “Please let me cum!” </p><p>“Do you think you deserve such a reward, even after being such a naughty girl?” I whispered even as I gripped her thighs, spreading them open even more, treating myself to the amazing view of her softness, shimmering like a mirage under the errant rays of moonlight. </p><p>“No,” she moaned immediately even as she tried to clench her legs. “But please, let me cum!” </p><p>“As you wish, sweetie?” I commented, deciding to finally have mercy on her and went down on her pinkness, my tongue darting out aggressively, alternating between caressing her knob and teasing her lips, her moans getting particularly loud whenever I let my fingers assist. “How does it feel?” I asked. </p><p>“It feels ama-ZING,” she cried, triggering a helpless cry as the orgasm finally hit, turning her into a gasping and trembling mess, murmuring incoherently, her arousal exploding on my face. I just chuckled as she tussled and turned, trying to process the strongest arousal that she ever experienced thanks to the combined effect of the extended foreplay and the mental weight of the situation. </p><p>I just chuckled as I pulled myself up, ready to bring things into the next step… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Watching Aviada grab her friend’s head roughly, pushing her forward without care even as Carla coughed and wheezed around my shaft was a rather great experience. I was fully in favor of Aviada paying back for Carla’s earlier trick, especially Carla’s already weak resistance melted rather speedily. </p><p>“Is she also going to receive-” Aviada asked without regard, only for me to silence her with a kiss. </p><p>“For the fucks sake, sweetie, keep your mouth shut about that unless I give you explicit permission,” I whispered, glad that Carla was far too occupied to pay attention to our discussion. </p><p>“But-” Aviada tried to say, only for me to silence her with another kiss, this time aggressively, biting her lips in warning. She responded equally aggressively, her complaints forgotten. As we kissed, she continued to push Carla forward again and again, forcing her throat to widen despite the obvious signs of distress Carla was putting out. </p><p>“Tap my leg twice if you can’t handle it,” I said to Carla after pulling out of the kiss, only to receive a solitary pinch, signaling that she didn’t appreciate my concern. Apparently, she didn’t appreciate me intervening with her little game with Aviada. </p><p>I shrugged, returning my attention to Aviada’s breasts, which, while smaller than Carla’s monstrous ones, still beautiful enough to make an amazing plaything. But since Carla’s tits were busy repeatedly hitting against my legs, I had to keep my hands busy somehow, right?</p><p>“Do you have any other ideas about the task allocation for the mission,” Aviada said gleefully as she pushed Carla deep once more, making her gag and moan. “Maybe about the allocation of the rear guard?” she added even as she let Carla slide away. </p><p>“It’s pretty much set,” Carla answered immediately. Well, almost immediately, as it took a while for her to cough and wheeze as she tried to catch her breath. “I don’t think there’s a need for a reallocation, unless someone wants to admit she can’t handle the mission assigned.” </p><p>From the frustration on Aviada’s face, it was clear that Carla had scored rather impressively. Rather than saying anything, Aviada pushed Carla deep once more, but the flicker of enthusiasm that flickered on her face a second before my shaft was lodged in her throat suggested that Aviada’s strategy might not be as effective as she might first assume. After all, Carla had been wanting to taste my cock for a while now as evidenced by her excessive voyeurism habits, and all Aviada was achieving was to give her an easy excuse to meet her desire. </p><p>It would have been much more effective if she had pushed Carla away to take her place, not that I would expect Aviada to think that. She wasn’t stupid, that was for sure, but she had a very direct way of thinking, uncaring of the potential complications, confident to break through everything directly. </p><p>Somehow, it made her uniquely attractive, her raven hair dancing freely as she pushed Carla forth repeatedly. I leaned back to take her nipples while Carla’s lips massaged the base of my cock, a considerable part of it lodged in her hot throat, her nose hitting against my stomach repeatedly.</p><p>After repeated personal attempts, Aviada had learned the proper points of a good deep-throat, and was using her knowledge to deliver maximum experience, making Carla’s throat stay around my girth as she desperately gagged, her spit gurgling down. Luckily, my expertise in terms of physical affection delivery was unmatched, allowing me to give Aviada’s breasts the proper attention they deserved, licking and kissing, even as Carla’s throat did its best to distract me. </p><p>“Mmm, just like that,” Aviada moaned in appreciation as she looked down, catching my gaze with a smug expression, no doubt enjoying her position of power just as much as she had enjoyed her earlier submissive position, proving that she enjoyed dominating just as much as she enjoyed being submissive. </p><p>Cornelia was similar to her in that aspect, and honestly, that was one of the more difficult things for me to understand. How could someone enjoy dominating and being dominated in such equal measures? For me, the best I could do was to feign weakness, but even such an act would only be enjoyable because of the subtle control I could exert on the situation. Actual submissiveness, whether sexual or political, was just abhorrent to me. </p><p>Maybe it was a female thing, I decided, shrugging as I abandoned that particular track, focusing back on Aviada’s breasts, while Carla’s deepthroating finally gave the result it was seeking, making me cum once more, filling her mouth with my seed. </p><p>“Still no change of plans?” Aviada asked after letting Carla pull back once more. </p><p>“Of course not,” Carla managed to answer between her coughs, trying to prevent my seed from spilling out by swallowing, which was a nice surprise despite her lackluster success, spilling some of it to a humongous expanse of her pale tits. </p><p>“I don’t think your tactic is being as effective as you think,” I said with a chuckle as I looked down, catching Carla’s eyes, who managed to blush at being called. </p><p>Unsurprisingly, Aviada decided to take it a very different way. “You’re right,” she said as she sat on the bed, behind Carla, and pulled her on her lap. In the end, Aviada was sitting with her back against the bedpost, and Carla on her lap, her legs parted by Aviada’s hands on her thighs, pulling hard. “We should properly punish her,” Aviada said even as she created an inviting position.  </p><p>As much as her wet lips shone invitingly, I met with Carla’s eyes first, waiting for her to nod excitedly, more than happy with how Aviada’s punishment was developing, allowing her to taste the pleasure while conveniently removing her responsibility in the process. I smirked as I crouched down, my shaft quick to return to life. </p><p>“Are you sure you’re ready?” I asked mockingly as I looked at her spectacular tits. </p><p>“Go ahead,” Carla said smugly, feeling rather confident. Since my earlier exploration revealed it wasn’t her first time, I wasn’t surprised by her confidence. Still, that didn’t mean she could handle my assault. </p><p>Of course, I would be lying if I said her confidence to handle me didn’t tickle my annoyance a bit. Luckily, she was positioned perfectly to be punished by a slight change of plan. A touch to her skin was enough for me to cast a spell to clean her backdoor entrance, and lubricating it just enough to turn a painful experience into uncomfortable, but not resolve any further. </p><p>“What are you-” she gasped in panic when she felt my shaft pressing against her puckered hole. From the way her eyes widened, I deduced that particular hole was yet to be touched by any kind of attention, be it a toy or male kind. </p><p>Aviada reacted quicker than I did. “I knew you couldn’t handle a proper fucking,” she laughed victoriously, though her grip on Carla’s legs didn’t loosen. </p><p>“Who said I can’t handle it?” Carla countered quickly, her pride proving to be stronger than her fear. Her legs sprayed even wider, and she even lifted her ass to give me better access. And what an access it was. Her tits almost rivaled Marianne’s, but her ass was a touch superior to my sweet healer, showing the advantage of her mobile lifestyle, adding just the right amount of muscle to her otherwise plump ass. </p><p>It was a unique pleasure to enjoy such a special booty, I decided even as I started pushing, her eyes closing in anticipation of pain, gasping in advance. Aviada looked frustrated at Carla’s sudden acceptance, and loosened her grip on her thighs. But rather than surrendering, she decided to grab Carla’s tits, twisting her nipples aggressively. </p><p>“Bitch,” Carla gasped in shock, barely paying attention to the steady movement of my shaft invading her puckered hole, too distracted by the recent assault on her sensitive nipples.  </p><p>Since Aviada was being such a good girl by helping me —even if it wasn’t her original intention— I decided to reward her. I slid my hand under Carla’s ass, finding Aviada’s clit before I started to rub, earning a shocked gasp, one that was quick to turn into moans of pleasure as my fingers slipped inside her core, enjoying her wetness coating my skin once more. </p><p>Meanwhile, Carla’s gasps of pained pleasure mixed with Aviada’s purer moans, even as I pushed deeper and deeper into her tight hole. I turned my focus back to Carla’s tight ass, grabbing her ass both as leverage, and sinking my fingers into their tight expanse. As her body adapted to my presence, I started to move faster and faster, intensifying her pained yelps as a result. Aviada’s lips pressing against her neck, biting and kissing, didn’t help.</p><p>It wasn’t hard to see the signs of an impending climax on Carla’s face, which was understandable. After all, she was struggling under quadruple assault, namely, my shaft invading her puckered hole, my hands molesting her amazing ass, Aviada’s hands mauling her tits, and Aviada’s lips creating a visible trail of hickeys on her neck. I decided to enhance her sources of arousal once more, and pulled my fingers out of Aviada’s snatch, only to push inside hers immediately. </p><p>Therefore, after a few aggressive pumps, it wasn’t a surprise when she started trembling under the effects of a spectacular orgasm. She was moaning loudly even as she moved her hips, desperately trying to increase the resulting friction. Her juices flooded desperately, drenching my fingers, while she tried to ride out the climax. </p><p>She desperately needed a break. </p><p>Too bad for her that neither Aviada nor I had the slightest inclination to actually give her the reprieve her moans were implicating. Aviada continued her dedicated assault on her tits while my hips sped up, making her moans even louder. </p><p>“Are you still sure about the plan?” Aviada said mockingly, though it was clear that she was making a point rather than expecting an answer. Which was nice, because Carla was barely able to moan coherently let alone answering Aviada’s question. </p><p>“I don’t think she is in a mood to make complicated strategic decisions,” I said even as I quickened my assault, enjoying her moans, which were getting louder and louder. “But you’re such a good friend, helping your friend intimately.” </p><p>“Aren’t I?” she said mockingly. </p><p>“Oh, definitely,” I said. “Why don’t you help her clean up as well,” I said, reminding her Carla’s lips, still coated with my cum. </p><p>“I don’t know,” she said with a wild smirk. “I like to get it from the source.” </p><p>“Oh, I know,” I said. “Don’t worry about that, as I don’t think our little ranger would last for long. We have the rest of the night to handle that. Meanwhile, why don’t you clean her lips.” </p><p>Luckily, at this point, my fingers, once again returned to her wetness after Carla climaxed, mellowed her enough that she followed my suggestion without further argument, which was rather impressive considering her personality. Her lips closed over Carla’s, their tongues swirling around each other while Aviada steadily cleaned up Carla’s mouth and chin, getting the leftovers of my climax. </p><p>They kissed deeply for a few moments until Aviada pulled back for a moment to say, \"Mmmm, it tastes so good.\"</p><p>“Slut,” Carla managed to stammer, which was a rather uncalled, especially since she was quite enthusiastic about resuming the kiss once Aviada leaned once more, not to mention she was still being impaled mercilessly in the ass, the only thing preventing her moans from becoming deafening was Aviada’s lips, suppressing her cries. </p><p>Carla was not in a position to comment when I grabbed her legs to pull them on my shoulders, allowing me to push myself to the hilt, stretching her ass properly. If she wanted to say something, that was too bad because Aviada was very effective in silencing her even as she continued to maul her tits simultaneously. </p><p>Squeezed between the combined assault, it didn’t take long for Carla to climax once more, this time even more intensely. As she tightened, she earned another explosion of me, this time coating her bowels, which only intensified her climax. </p><p>Aviada pulled back, giving Carla the opportunity to declare her climax. However, she was barely able to moan a bunch of hard-to-decipher mumbles, barely intelligible. She closed her eyes, falling unconscious. </p><p>“Well, that was fun,” I said even as pulled back, creating a popping sound, before I turned my attention to Aviada. Still, just to be safe, I cast a sleeping spell on Carla before looking at Aviada. “Now, let’s move onto your lesson, about properly keeping secrets and the consequences of loose lips.” </p><p>Aviada snarled as she slid under Carla, leaving her to sleep while readying herself for the struggle, despite knowing she would lose. But her smile suggested that she didn’t exactly mind losing… </p><p>—————</p><p>[Level: 30    Experience: 447193 / 465000 </p><p>Strength: 41    Charisma: 53</p><p>Precision: 35    Perception: 37</p><p>Agility: 35     Manipulation: 40</p><p>Speed: 34       Intelligence: 44</p><p>Endurance: 34      Wisdom: 46</p><p>HP: 5370  / 5370\tMana: 6600  / 6600        ]</p><p><br></p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Master Melee [100/100]</p><p>Master Tantric [100/100]</p><p>Master Biomancy [100/100]</p><p>Master  Elemental [100/100]</p><p>Master Subterfuge [97/100]         </p><p>Master Arcana [95/100]        </p><p>Expert Speech [70/75]</p><p>Advanced Craft [50/50]</p><p><br></p><p>PERKS</p><p>Mana Regeneration   </p><p>Skill Share</p><p>Empowerment (1/1)</p><p>Teleportation</p><p><br></p><p>COMPANIONS </p><p>[Cornelia - Level 21/25]</p><p>[Helga - Level 17/21] </p>",

    "content": "<p>As I looked at Sapphire, enjoying the great cleavage created by her modified maid costume, but even with that as a distraction, it was impossible for her to hide her growing frustration. She clearly hated her position, worthy of a servant, even if that was only until she could bewitch me and turn me into her slave. It wasn’t hard to guess all the revenge scenarios that were filling her mind. </p><p>It was that frustration, more than anything, changed my mind about the sequence of events. Rather than starting things with the physical aspect and then moving to politics, I decided to start with the reverse —with a decent amount of teasing sprinkled in, of course. The tantric spells she was trying to use on me were already enhancing her arousal. I would be an idiot not to enhance those effects. </p><p>“So, my Queen,” I started, not even bothering to add a mocking tone as I pronounced her rank. Considering the situation, it wasn’t entirely necessary. “Tell me, how can I be of service for our glorious Empire?” </p><p>“We have checked the location you have provided,” she answered, trying to keep her voice steady, even mostly succeeding in her attempt. Too bad her success didn’t translate to her nipples, which were getting harder with each passing second as the backlash of her spell started to hit her. </p><p>“Good for you,” I said after I realized she had no intention of continuing, this time adding a mocking edge as I looked down at her, then let her continue. She was trying to apply one of the most basic conversational tricks, making a statement, hoping that I would continue to fill the silence. Such tricks were often used in negotiations, trying to trick one side to define an opening stance, which was almost inevitably weaker. </p><p> If she was thinking she could get the upper hand with that kind of trick, forcing me to reveal what I wanted, she was mistaken. With Isolde and Lancelot away —and Emma and Aria conquered— she was the only one I needed to hide my recent state of captivity, meaning I could spend as much as time she was willing to spend in this room. The fact that it was much more comfortable than my cell was a big bonus. </p><p>“I’m interested in purchasing the location of the Eternal Core,” she continued. “State your price.” </p><p>I chuckled. “Don’t be too hasty, my little Queen,” I said even as I caressed her cheek, enjoying the hateful look she threw back, the blue of her eyes reminding me of a stormy ocean at its strongest. “There’s no need to make the biggest trade immediately, is it?” I added. “After all, we’re not in a hurry. Maybe I can interest you with the location of another cache of items? This time, containing some rare magical books, one I had helped my previous client to procure from the ruins of Atrema.” </p><p>I didn’t miss —nor I was surprised by— the sudden flicker of interest, disappearing as soon as it appeared. After all, Atrema was an ancient kingdom with little renown, but a serious historian would know that tantric magic was one of their expertise areas. One of, but definitely not the most, which was important because I didn’t want her to know about her usage of tantric magic as much as possible. Atrema was the perfect candidate, as they had several more important magical areas, including how to manage raw magic energy, a branch closely linked to use the Eternal core. </p><p>I had no doubt that the Queen had better sources about that, and that made it an even better bargaining tool to make her think she managed to trick me.</p><p>“Not the most valuable item to trade,” she said, keeping her tone calm, using it as a bargaining tool on the surface, but also probing me about the potential information about her specialty. </p><p>“Well, I think that some extra sources about phase magic would come in handy when you start working with the Eternal Core, but if you don’t want it, we don’t need to trade for it,” I said. “After all, I’m sure I can find something else that would get your interest.” </p><p>Of course, just because I was handling a complicated negotiation didn’t mean that I would refrain from teasing her physically. I could have let my hands drop down and squeeze her spectacular tits, or pull my cock out for another spectacular blowjob session. But both of those options were too aggressive, lacking the impact I was going for. </p><p>In the end, I decided to remove my shoe and sock rapidly, only to push my naked foot between her legs, under her ass, essentially making her ride my foot. Demeaning, dismissive, yet overbearingly sexy at the same time, especially when the target was concerned. </p><p>To her credit, she didn’t react to it other than another momentary flash of anger, no doubt imagining the orders my torturer would receive once she was finished with me. Though, considering what I had seen on that aspect, I wasn’t exactly scared. “What else you have in mind,” she said immediately, seemingly willing to pass the opportunity to get the books of Atrema kingdom. </p><p>“Well, I have a few more interesting prospects, but they are rather more expensive in terms of the political concessions I require. I don’t think we’re that level of trust yet,” I backtracked, giving her the impression that I wasn’t valuing that particular item of exchange very much. Even as I said that, however, I moved my foot, pushing her arousal even higher. </p><p>“And what it would cost me?” she asked. </p><p>“I do have a couple of clients interested in some of the artifacts busy gathering dust in a trophy room somewhere,” I murmured. “Maybe you would be interested in exchanging it with the famed Scythe of Destruction,” I offered, well aware that it would get rejected. </p><p>“Impossible,” she immediately replied, though I was happy to note that her voice was getting a little strained as I continued to caress her slit with my foot steadily, her wetness covering my skin. </p><p>“Hmm, how about one of the daggers of darkness, one that you extracted from digging the ancient ruins. After not discovering its usage for more than a year, it shouldn’t be too big of a loss,” I said, my smile quirking as her eyes widened at the casual display of one of the more important secrets, one I had learned from Valkyrie during our regular information exchange. </p><p>It paid dividends to have an enemies-with-benefit relationship with one of the most important knights of the Empire. </p><p>“I’m afraid that it’s equally impossible,” she answered, her voice stiff. </p><p>“Really,” I said lazily, internally happy with her rejection. I didn’t want to take an untested weapon as payment. I just used that to spook her further while flexing my mysterious power, making her even more hesitant to take action. “Another rejection,” I said even as I let my hand trail her jawline before landing on her lips, caressing tenderly. “Should I assume that you’re actually interested in making the payment physically, and you’re just playing hard to get?” </p><p>“No,” she said stiffly, but no motion to actually push my hand away, once again showing her excellent positional awareness, though I was willing to believe that her physical arousal played an important role as well. Tantric spells were an insidious tool to take down their target, but they were equally dangerous for their caster, as displayed by her. </p><p>“Oh, really,” I said, letting my hand trail down until it slipped into her costume, her nipples hard enough to push against my palm. “Your body seems to disagree with you,” I added, squeezing her nipple until an erotic gasp escaped her mouth, then pulled back, not only my hand, but also my foot. “But it must be true if you say so. You’re the Queen, after all. It’s not like you’re going to lie, right?” </p><p>The resulting anger and frustration were simply spectacular, the sight enough was enough to almost make me cream in my pants. There was something special in watching her getting more and more aroused, the effect enhanced by her own magic, but helpless to resolve it. </p><p>“So, why don’t you give me a couple of ideas about what you can spare from your arsenal?” I asked. “Maybe I can pick something from your selection.” </p><p>That started a lengthy yet intense bargaining section, where she had offered several obscure items —some of them quite valuable, some even unknown to me— while I tried to push her toward a certain direction without being too obvious about my needs, not wanting to reveal that I was looking for an item useful for my current purposes, trying to sell the idea that I was trying to resell whatever I would get. </p><p>No need to alarm her. </p><p>Of course, my hands were not exactly idle during the bargain. I poked and caressed her body quite often, occasionally helped by my foot, pushing her deeper and deeper into arousal, making her suffer the torturous effects of staying on the edge constantly. She wasn’t as inexperienced as Emma, making her struggle visibly harder, but luckily, her persistence in negotiation gave me the chance I was looking for. Of course, she had her own reasons to extend the session. </p><p>Pity that I had long countered those reasons… </p><p>“Hmm,” I murmured. “Since you’re going to be stingy about the special items, I guess I have to accept the payment as you offer, but only because I’m very happy with the ancillary service you provide,” I said mockingly, accepting her latest offer of gold and some rare magical items that would be extremely useful in adding some new wards to the secret tunnels, maybe even adding some modifications to her room. </p><p>Just to underline my point, I spanked her tit loudly, enjoying the sensation it left in my palm and her outraged expression equally, especially since she had no choice but to swallow the insult if she didn’t want to waste everything she had worked for. </p><p>Then, surprisingly, she failed to swallow that particular insult. “You’re pushing your luck,” she said, raising her hand, her fingers glowing with a glimmering spell. </p><p>“Oh, really? Am I pushing my luck?” I said even as I grabbed her wrist, easily dispelling the spell by distracting her. However, I hadn’t used the trick I had used against Emma that would leave her helpless, not wanting to scare her, just distracting her enough to break the spell. </p><p>She wasn’t competent in warfare, and it showed. </p><p>I pulled her on my lap before she could react, but not to make her sit. Instead, her stomach was pressing against my thighs, and her ass pointing upward, like she was a mischievous student about to be punished by her teacher. “Am I pushing my luck?” I asked as I spanked her ass, hard enough to make her cry. </p><p>I could feel her body tensing, but much to my surprise, it wasn’t because she was trying to attack me. No, it was because she was already suffering on the edge for the last half an hour, and that spank finally pushed her over the edge. </p><p>Her magically-enhanced climax was simply spectacular. She continued to moan helplessly, her skin twitching and tingling, while she gushed like a fountain. “It can’t be,” she murmured again and again, genuinely shocked by her own reaction while her body trembled with pleasure. </p><p>“Really?” I said mockingly even as I grabbed her hair and forced her to look at the mirror, allowing her to full spectacle of her extraordinary orgasm. Her beautiful blue eyes widened in shock as she absorbed the obscenity of her own expression as her ability to control it slipped completely… “Do you think the mirror is lying to you? Or maybe, it’s showing you a different blonde slut that’s currently climaxing like a first-time virgin enjoying the attention of her husband,” I said, enjoying her anger more than I should. “Or maybe you would prefer if I call you a maid enjoying the treatment of her master…” </p><p>I enjoyed the results of her spectacular orgasm, intensifying further as I forced her to face her own expression, all the while trying to decide what to do next. Should I continue playing with her, forcing her to another climax, or should I let her recover a degree of control before pushing for the next step… </p>",

    "content": "<p>The waiting period had passed surprisingly quickly, as I was distracted by watching the training of the gladiators, most of the activities surprisingly similar to my childhood. The physical aspects of the training were harder than what I had experienced as a child, but considering they didn’t have any magical exercises they had to do simultaneously, the overall difficulty wasn’t too different. </p><p>Though, the similarity in exercises was too much to be a coincidence, making me suspect that my grandfather had firsthand experience. Maybe he had worked as a trainer in youth, or owned a gladiator school. Pity that I couldn’t pop back in the mansion to check the truth of the matter. </p><p>As the days progressed, most of the slaves collapsed before their deadline, though the majority collapsed during the early parts of the second day, not even making the halfway. When the while the other slaves around me collapsed one after another, finally hitting their exhaustion limit. The collapsed slaves were taken out of the school by servants, no doubt to be used for other markets.</p><p>Though, not all failures were about exhaustion. More than one slave suddenly exploded in rage after a particularly nasty insult, daring to attack the gladiator in question, only to be beaten handily before being taken away. Their defeat was not surprising. They might be good warriors, but so were other gladiators, and not only they weren’t delirious with exhaustion, but they were also wearing armor and carrying weapons. Their loss was a foregone conclusion. </p><p>So, the group got smaller and smaller as the candidates got eliminated one by one. As the number of slaves decreased, however, the intensity of the insults and attacks from the passerby’s increased, going as far as hitting us directly.  But the remaining ones proved smart enough to understand their fate if they retaliated even if they didn’t understand the real aim of their low-key torture.</p><p>A rather harsh hazing ritual, though the lack of actual malice made it easier to bear the implied insult. Also, their insults needed quite a bit of work. </p><p>As the sun started to set for the third day, the large group had been cut to five candidates including me, every single one of them holding through sheer willpower rather than physical strength. Standing up for three days without sleep or food was rather challenging if one didn’t have a boiling source of magic replenishing one’s physical state continuously. </p><p>Still, I copied their trembling stance and empty expression, making sure I looked slightly stronger. Being the strongest candidate was important. I needed to be a famous gladiator to be invited to the patrician estates, and the easiest way to do that was to shine among the potential candidates, but not to a point of getting suspicious.</p><p>Just as the sun was setting, a bulky, armored man walked toward us, carrying an ancient-looking spear in hand, one that radiated more magic than I had ever felt in a weapon. None of the weapons in our family arsenal —at least the ones I was allowed to train with by my grandfather— had come close to it, nor any weapon I had seen being used in the Halls of Saturn back in Britanium. </p><p>I doubted that even with my new abilities and everything I had learned from the library of the lost city, I could replicate such a spectacular weapon. </p><p>Another man walked toward us, carrying a stick with him. “Line up for the master of Ludus Dacicus,” he shouted, his stick in the display, symbolizing the threat of physical punishment at the slightest delay. As much as I wanted to break that stick on his head, I obeyed the order quickly, not wanting to be marked as a problem maker. Also, after acting like a loser in the magical school for years, the open hostility of the gladiator school was much easier to handle. </p><p>Five of us formed a line straight line in front of the cellblock. The master of the school stood in front of us, his bronze breastplate gleaming under the golden rays of the sunset, enhancing the impression further, making the other four straighten themselves with fascination. </p><p>“Attention,” he shouted, his voice bouncing off the walls, deafeningly loud. I had to admit, the theatrics of the moment was excellent. The master of the school was a hulking man with a serious face, his muscles bulging threateningly even as he stood in front of us. The red cape he was wearing enhanced his stature further. For the other four, who was delirious with thirst and exhaustion, he must look like he was shining with the blessing of Mars. </p><p>Just with one word, his authority was established. I wondered just how many times this little play happened since the school was established.</p><p>He let the silence stretch for a long while as he examined us, making a show of his distaste, then turned toward the man that carried. “Is this the best you can find, Pico? Are these the men we’re supposed to present as the public of Rome as their next legends,” he asked. </p><p>“Unfortunately, that’s the best we can find, Master Antonius,” the man named Pico answered, equally artificial. “But at least, they are stubborn. If they are tough enough to handle my training without dying, maybe I can cobble a proper gladiator between all five of them.” </p><p>From the way the four bristled, their low-key insults were working wonders. Understandable, as all four had the classical hallmarks of exceptional warriors, and they were likely one of the strongest ones in their tribe, if not the strongest. </p><p>And if there was one thing a good warrior hated, it was being underestimated, ready to be killed, or be killed to prove their position. It was especially important if that insult came from someone they respect. While none of us knew anything about the master of Ludus Dacicus, we have watched other gladiators train for three days, even the weakest one impressively strong. The respect shown by the same gladiators toward him, combined with his impressive stature and showy entrance immediately cemented him as the most important authority in the training camp. </p><p>So much that the same slaves that had been tortured for three days had their stances stiffen, trying to display their strength toward him the moment his gaze fell on them. I copied their fascination, of course, not wanting to be marked a troublemaker. “Not a total disaster,” he murmured after he examined each of us for a lengthy period. “Maybe you’re right. One of them might prove strong enough to be a gladiator, maybe even two if gods decided to take mercy on us.”  </p><p>Then, his gaze dragged along the school. “Gather round,” he called, and every single gladiator rushed toward us, gathering behind him as a half-circle. “There are five slaves here, but luckily for them, they proved themselves to be slightly better than other worms who are only fit to clean the asses of their noble masters. From today until I deem them as failures, they will be your younger brothers, apprentices that work toward the admittance to our glorious Dacian brotherhood, a holy entity that wrote its name to the Republic history with golden letters. Do you deem them satisfactory?” </p><p>“No!” shouted every single one of them. </p><p>“Tell me why!” he shouted. </p><p>“They are weak!” called all of them simultaneously, their cadence echoing off the walls. </p><p>“What else!” </p><p>“They are untested!” shouted the gladiators. </p><p>“What else!” </p><p>“They are unbloodied!” </p><p>Then, Antonius turned toward us. “You heard them. You’re yet to be accepted as a part of our group. Luckily, not all is lost. Pico here had turned worse worms than you into proper gladiators, as long as they were tenacious enough not to die from exhaustion. You’ll exercise when we tell you, you’ll eat when we tell you, and you’ll rest when we tell you. No exception. And if you prove tough enough to survive the training, we will turn you into demigods. Gold, women, fame… All will be yours.” Then, he once again turned toward the gladiators. “Show them, my warriors,” he shouted. </p><p>Two gladiators split from the group, one using a spear, the other with a shield and a gladius, and without saying anything, they started fighting. Dashing, twirling, and dancing around each other’s blows, all the while delivering attacks strong enough to skewer a lesser man with just one blow, sand flying under their sandals as they moved, occasionally mixed with the blood as they delivered each other glancing blows. </p><p>Impressive, I thought, especially since neither of them was actually displaying their full capability, their strength restrained not to deliver an accidental deadly strike. However, as impressive as they were, I couldn’t help but watch the others carefully, and almost every single one of them had a wound or more currently preventing them from moving efficiently. </p><p>Apparently, Theodora’s information about the decline of Dacian School wasn’t just wild conjecture, if almost everyone had wounds to prevent them from moving efficiently, especially since they didn’t use magical healers to solve it. The only explanation was that they were wounded so often that magical healing started to become inadvisable. Occasional healing was completely okay, but if used too often, infusion of external energy could get very dangerous. </p><p>Of course, my fellow slaves were focused on the show and their own exhaustion to notice that particular detail. Admittedly, it was a good show. </p><p>“Enough,” called Antonius after a minute, as they pulled back, their breath not even quickened, showing the extent of their conditioning. Then, another man, a short, thin-looking one split from the group, carrying a battleaxe. He walked silently toward a training dummy, and when he swung his axe, the dummy split with a thunderous crack. </p><p>For the next show, Antonius didn’t even say anything, just raised his hand, holding a large gold coin between his fingers. One of the other warriors picked a throwing pilum, and dashed to the other end of the opening, and threw it with a smooth movement, not only hitting the gold coin, but also hitting the target on the other side of the opening in the bullseye. </p><p>“These are the men you’ll turn into, as long as you listen to Pico’s instructions obediently. Don’t forget, if Pico says fight, you fight. If Pico says sleep, you sleep. Because if Pico says you die, you die!” </p><p>With that, he turned and left, and the rest of the gladiators followed him, their steady steps cracking like a storm, their weapons like thunder.  </p><p>“Do you understand the amazing opportunity you’re facing, worms?” Pico shouted as he walked closer to us. </p><p>“Yes, sir,” came the answer from all of us, the exhaustion in our tone disappeared in excitement. And I had to admit, even I was excited, despite knowing just how calculated the show had been. The others had no chance, they were already sold to the glorious dreams of being a gladiator.</p><p>“No, you don’t, you just think you do,” he answered immediately. “But don’t worry, I’ll break you only to remake you into demigods. And when you stand in the middle of Colosseum, a hundred thousand citizens, nobles and commoners alike crying your name, you’ll understand the true value of the opportunity you’re facing.” </p><p>He took a deep breath before continuing. “From now on, you’ll listen to my orders like gospel. I don’t care about your circumstances, your past, your families, your past achievements, your life story. For me, you have just born five minutes ago, the moment the master of the school deemed that you have the slightest chance to join our brotherhood. And until you step onto the arena for the first time, and step out with your life, earning your name, you’re children, and I’m your parent. Whatever I say is the law. Is that understood?” </p><p>“Yes, sir,” came the answer simultaneously. </p><p>“Not bad,” said Pico, nodding his scarred face. “Your training will start tomorrow. I want you all here at the first light of dawn, every single day, unless I specifically order otherwise. That’s your first order. You’ll not like the punishment if you are late to training.” </p><p>He pointed as a servant standing in the corner. “He’s going to bring you to your dormitory. Until you prove yourself in the arena, you’ll all stay in the same dormitory, and your food will be brought there. Your food will be there when you wake up, and it’ll be ready when I send you to sleep. Everyone has to finish their plate completely. I don’t care if you don’t like the food, and I don’t care if you’re not hungry. If not, the servants will report it to me, and you’ll be punished. Eating your food as important as the training you’ll have. Understood?” </p><p>“Yes, sir,” said the group simultaneously. </p><p>He paused to make sure we had time to let his words sink in. “For the next month, you will be trained to build your strength and fitness up. When I think you’re strong enough, I’ll add weapons training, starting with the signature weapon of our Dacian school, the spear,” he said, twirling his own spear showily. “Then, based on your aptitude, we’ll be adding more weapons. Some of you will be experts to fight against wild animals, some of you will train to fight war prisoners. However, only the best of you will have the right to fight against the gladiators from other Ludus, the most glorious task a gladiator could be assigned.” </p><p>“Follow my orders, and you’ll eat the food more delicious than you can imagine, and fuck women more beautiful than you can dream. Disobey, and pain awaits you.” He paused for a moment. “Disobey often, then death…” he added, throwing his spear even as he said so, hitting a target in the bullseye. An extraordinary maneuver considering it wasn’t even a throwing spear. </p><p>Without saying anything, he dismissed us, and we followed the servant toward our new living area. As we walked, I couldn’t help but think that my time in Ludus would be more interesting than I had first assumed… </p>",

    "title": "Fun with Nerdy Girls 7",
    "content": "<p>A few seconds after she had made her decision, Carrie remembered that she was covered in cum, and beat a hasty retreat toward the shower. While following her was rather tempting, I instead moved to the bedroom, removing some of the more obvious mess, making the room as presentable as possible, before I went back to the corridor. </p><p>“I’ll be downstairs, watching TV,” I said to her even as the water blasted on the other side of the door. </p><p>“Umm, would you mind bringing my bag from my car, it’s on the backseat,” Carrie murmured. “I forgot to bring that up.” </p><p>“Of course,” I said, doing my best not to chuckle in a way she might hear. I was amused by the fact that she had brought an overnight bag for her, even after her revealing —extremely revealing in her standards— way she dressed. </p><p>Maybe that was the way of the nerdy girls, slow at first, but rather aggressive once their initial hesitancy was broken.  </p><p>“I’ll leave it at the bathroom door, so you can pick it up whenever you want,” I said, then I picked the bag up and left there, rejecting the temptation to browse its content, wanting to keep its contents as a surprise. After her earlier ensemble, I was curious what she had as a nightie, or whether she actually had any. Then, I stopped in my bedroom for a quick change before taking the stairs. </p><p>Downstairs, I put some game tape, repeating some of the more complicated plays while scribbling on a piece of paper, doing my best to analyze the schemes. For all the violence it contained, football was a complicated game, especially for a quarterback. </p><p>I lost myself in the study, until I heard a pleasant voice calling me from the upstairs. “I’m ready,” she said as she peeked from the corner, only her head visible, her blush ever-present, pulling her head away the moment I turned to look up, her blonde hair swaying at the motion. </p><p>I chuckled at her sudden shyness. Considering what we had done on —or more accurately, under— my desk, and the fact that we would be sharing a bed in a few moments, her display of shyness was patently ridiculous, but amusing nonetheless. </p><p>After turning off the TV and tidying up my game notes —with care much greater than I had paid to my homework— I climbed up the stairs, toward my bedroom. </p><p>Only to find it almost unrecognizable. Admittedly, there weren’t a lot of changes, but the lights were off, and a couple of scented candles were burning at strategic locations, giving the room a completely different aura. Of course, for this, the real role went to Carrie, sitting on the side of the bed with her eyes fixed on the floor, who had the honor of being the first girl to enter my new bedroom. </p><p>She was beautiful enough to take my breath. She was wearing a long, satin nightie with a lot of lace, faded crimson, and significantly out of fashion, reminding me of a sixties housewife, loose enough to hide her curves, no hint of cleavage, and almost long enough to cover her knees even when she was sitting, but paradoxically, it somehow worked better than the most revealing lingerie possible. Not because it was sexy, but it underlined the paradox of her innocence and her desire at the same time. </p><p>“You look beautiful,” I said even as I walked closer, caressing her cheek gently. When she looked up, I captured her lips in a soft, lingering kiss that made her moan helplessly. When I pulled back, her expression was flickering between shock and desire, giving me the confidence that if I pushed her down, there would be no resistance, and her compliant joining wasn’t too far away. </p><p>Instead, I passed her, and lay on the other side of the bed, slipping under the covers. “It’s getting late,” I said, making no attempt to hide my shit-eating grin. </p><p>She puffed with a cute display of momentary flare of anger, clearly not had enough of the kiss, but lacking the confidence to push for more. Still, she didn’t say anything as she slipped under the covers as well, snuggling under the covers, her body just at the right side for me to envelop as the small spoon. “Good night,” I whispered into her ear and kissed her cheek gently, and put my head on the pillow once more. </p><p>“Good night,” she replied, her voice barely above a trembling whisper, but her tone wasn’t trembling as badly as her body as she pressed her body against mine, strained with anticipation. After that, a warm silence filled the room, the flickers of the scented candles or the cinnamon smell weren’t exactly helpful in reducing the heat of the moment. Her body pressed against mine, enjoying our closeness. I hugged her waist, pulling her even closer, until my shaft was pressing against her plump bottom. </p><p>A minute passed, then two, then five, but the sleep proved elusive even for me… For Carrie, it was pure torture, of the sweetest kind. When the silence was stretching to fifteen, Carrie started shuffling in her place as if she was trying to bury herself deeper into my embrace, getting tenser with each passing second. Her hips moved, burying my shaft deeper into the delicious valley between her plump cheeks. </p><p>I was tempted enough to pull her nightie up and slide it between her naked cheeks, but I held back, feeling morbidly curious just how long she would be able to resist. Though, I wasn’t able to keep myself from cheating just a bit, caressing her stomach rhythmically whenever she moved, making it impossible for her to settle down her senses under the constant stream of low-level arousal. </p><p>Teasing her like this was amusing and erotic at the same time, which was a rare experience for me. My previous experience was geared toward the explosive side, so that even if the act itself took a long time thanks to my stamina, the events leading to that had always followed a predictable pattern, usually resolved in minutes of being alone with the cheerleader of the week. Teasing Carrie slowly while her arousal built up further and further was an interesting experience. </p><p>However, when we were nearing the half-hour mark, I was starting to question the wisdom of my decision, no matter how fun it was at the beginning. Teasing her was entertaining, but my erection —which was inevitable while her ass constantly wiggling against my crotch— was starting to become rather painful. I decided to give her a little push. “You know you don’t have to hold yourself back, right?” I whispered directly into her ear, my breath caressing her skin. </p><p>It turned out that Carrie was struggling even worse than I was, because that was all that she needed to pull out of my embrace and push me on my back with surprising enthusiasm and strength. Then, she climbed on top of me, sitting at my midsection, the coverslipping away as she moved. However, once she was there, she stalled. I gave her an encouraging smile, but said nothing, giving her time to process what she was feeling properly. </p><p>Despite her hesitancy, it didn’t take long for her lips to find mine once again, taking control of the kiss for the first time, her tongue invading my mouth, conveying her burning desire, her out of character passion telling just how much she had been affected by the extended absence. Just like I had expected, just hugging affected her much worse than it did affect me. </p><p>Soon, her fingers grabbed my hair painfully, squeezing helplessly as she ravaged my mouth with her tongue with the desperation of a traveler lost in a desert, finally taking the first sip of water. What she lacked in experience, she was more than able to make up with her enthusiasm.</p><p>Then, she proved to me that even then, I had been underestimating her enthusiasm, when her hands deserted my hair, only for them to end up around my shorts, pushing them down along with my boxers. “Someone is enthusiastic,” I murmured, fascinated by the expression of concentration on her face as she pulled away from the kiss, only to pull her nightie up, enough for my naked shaft to touch the hidden area underneath… </p><p>Only to receive another little surprise. Under her conservative nightwear, a rather important part was completely absent, her panties. I bit my lips, glad that I hadn’t discovered that particular detail earlier, as I doubted I could have resisted the temptation. </p><p>“Do you mind if I…” she murmured with a shyness even as she mounted me, trying to align herself with my erection. </p><p>“Of course not, but we need a condom-” I started, only for her to put her finger on my lips. </p><p>“Don’t worry, I started taking the pill,” she said, even as she blushed thick enough to be visible even with the flickering light of the candles, getting smaller and smaller, once again surprising me with the particularities of what she thought as more shameful. Apparently, birth control was more shameful than preparing to ride me bareback. </p><p>Not that I was complaining, of course. </p><p>I stayed silent while she took the last step to properly ride me the age-old honored position of the cowgirl, though I felt pity that her amazing tits were still hidden behind the cover of her nightie. I didn’t ask her to remove it yet, however, afraid of scaring her just as she was getting brave enough to take the last step on her own. She was visibly shaking in a way I might have mistaken for fear if it wasn’t for the aroused shine in her blue eyes, captivatingly bright.</p><p>Then, she closed her eyes like she was trying to gather courage before the big jump, and her warm frame started sinking deeper over my shaft, her silky smoothness enveloping me completely. She let out a small gasp as she sank herself lower faster than I expected, signaling her graduation from virginity with a delicious gasp that begged me to flip her and impale her mercilessly until she could utter nothing but moans of pleasure. </p><p>But then, she pulled my t-shirt off almost violently before putting her hands on my muscular chest, and I decided to give her a chance. Her eyes still closed, she started rocking her hips wildly, her enthusiasm quickly rising to compensate for her lack of experience, and doing it spectacularly. I waited until the last hints of pain disappeared from her face before I grabbed the hem of her nightie, and freed her of its oppressive coverage with a sharp pull, leaving her body deliciously naked for my attention. </p><p>“No,” she gasped in panic as she wrapped her arms around her breasts reflexively, which made me hold her shoulders to prevent her from collapsing. </p><p>“It’s a bit late to hide these from my view, sweetie,” I said even as I let my hands slide down until they disappeared in the depths of their perkiness, earning a moan in the process. “Don’t you feel trying to hide them at this point, not to mention you have nothing to hide, not with how spectacular they look?” </p><p>“You really think they are beautiful,” she murmured even as her hips started to move once more, but this time, I didn’t sense any hesitancy in her tone. This time, she was simply fishing for compliments rather than trying to assuage her internal doubts. </p><p>Not that I had any problems with paying a few extra compliments to the spectacularly sexy blonde currently riding me to the best of her ability after giving me her virginity just moments ago. “You’re a masterpiece, Carrie,” I said, enjoying the way she quickened at my words. “You’re the most beautiful girl in the school, and luckily, I was the one to discover that,” I added, followed by several more compliments, all firmly in the cheesy territory. </p><p>But if the movement of her hips —and her moans— were any indicator, she had no problem with the cheesiness of the compliments. Though, I had long learned that a thick cock and a muscular chest had a way of making cheesy compliments rather effective. </p><p>I sank deeper into heaven as her movements started to pick up speed, my grunts of pleasure mixing with her moans, her tits dangling beautifully in the prison of my palms with every shake, her silky wetness enveloping my presence deeper and deeper. </p><p>A chuckle escaped my mouth even as she sped up. </p><p>\"What?\" she murmured dazedly, her eyes open once more without making her hips stop. </p><p>\"You’re just so beautiful,” I said sincerely even as I grabbed her hips, leading her to move even faster. “Seeing you naked in my bed, riding me with enthusiasm is a memorable spectacle.”</p><p>“Shut up,” she murmured shyly, but listening to the dance of her hips rather than her words looked like the better option. She decided to silence me the best way possible, leaning down until her lips closed over mine, her tongue burying itself into my mouth once more as her hips started gyrating. Then, she started to tighten in a final manner, putting every single nerve ending in my body to high alert, each thrust and every nibble pushing us steadily toward an explosion. </p><p>Then, her tightness turned into an inescapable prison as she started to shiver, triggering an explosion of my own, declaring an end of her first time as she collapsed against my chest powerlessly, but crying loud enough to make me glad we weren’t in an apartment. </p><p>Of course, the night was just beginning. I had allowed her to warm up, and the real event was about to start…</p>",
