    "content": "<p>As we left the checkpoint behind, I couldn’t help but give a regretful glance toward that way. With the checkpoint successfully left behind, our escape had just taken a big step forward. I should be feeling happy. Elated, even. </p><p>However, as my gaze turned to the single, solitary scale on my arm, the only thing I felt was a deep frustration. How could I feel anything else, when the evidence of a potential disaster lay on my arm, showing that my botched breakthrough had more side effects than I had been expecting. </p><p>“Don’t feel stressed. I’m sure we can find a solution,” Lillian suddenly commented, still on my back as I carried her. </p><p>“I’m not stressing,” I said, but her scoff showed that I wasn’t particularly successful. </p><p>“Of course not,” she said, her sarcasm thick. “That’s why you’re not speaking, and sighing repeatedly.” </p><p>Despite the situation, I couldn’t help but smile gently. It had been a while since anyone actually cared about me enough to bother reading my mood. It was a nice change of pace. “I trust you, miss druid,” I commented. </p><p>“Hey, don’t speak that. It’s supposed to be a secret,” she said with a frustrated tone. </p><p>I chucked. “I’m sorry. You’re right, we need to hide it. Who knows, we might end up being hunted. Imagine what a disaster it would be.” </p><p>Lillian slapped my shoulder. “Don’t be a jerk.” </p><p>“Sorry, but I need to entertain myself somehow,” I said, then smirked. “And, things I could do while running is limited. Camping, on the other hand —” </p><p>“Shut up,” she said as she slapped my shoulder, and I laughed. I could hear the blush she was sporting in her tone. </p><p>“As you wish,” I said. </p><p>The silence ruled for a while, as I ran. Lillian was distracted by my condition, using the opportunity to cast a lot of diagnostic spells on my body, trying to understand what was going on. She was worried. I said nothing to distract her. </p><p>I was worried as well. </p><p>The situation continued until dawn arrived. We managed to find another cave. It was an even better resting spot than the previous one, with a nice spring nearby that could also function as a bath, with several berry bushes nearby. It was a far better resting spot than the previous few. </p><p>I let her relax a bit before I spoke once more, distracting her from her musings. “Our residence awaits, madam,” I said teasingly. </p><p>“Good,” she said as she cleaned the cave with a blast of water, careful not to alert any possible pursuers. </p><p>“I’m going to hunt. Any preference? Boar, maybe a deer,” I said. “I’m feeling famished enough.” </p><p>“Whatever you want,” she said. “However, before you go, we need to talk a bit,” she said. I nodded, gesturing for her to speak. “We need to find a way to get in contact with one of the tribes.” </p><p>“The Germanic tribes,” I commented, shocked at her comment. “Do you think we don’t have enough trouble?” After all, there was no love lost between the Germanic tribes and Rome, with both sides spilling enough blood over the years to change the color of the Rhine River. “They will make a terrible hiding spot. We should just need to follow the border as we travel the east, and soon, we’ll leave Gaul behind. Once we get to Dacia, we’ll be free of any pursuers.” </p><p>“Free, but not safe,” she commented. </p><p>I frowned. “You’ll be as safe as it’s possible when you have a suspiciously connected organization chasing you,” I said. I didn’t want to sound frustrated, but the day hardly felt safe for me either. Learning that my body was somehow achieving the impossible by absorbing mana had been an unexpected revelation, and I had yet to deal with it. Getting angry at Lillian for her preferences might not be fair, but I had my own limits as well. </p><p>Lillian looked at me in a way I found difficult to understand. Frustrated, but also … fondly. “Idiot, I wasn’t talking about my safety. We need to understand what’s going on with your body, and clearly, the shapeshifters are the best targets.” </p><p>“You have been thinking about it,” I said. </p><p>“I had a lot of time to think,” she said as she walked closer, and put her finger on the sole scale on my arm. “Whatever this is, it’s not something normal, and we need to understand what’s this. And, the Germanic tribes are our best hope, certainly when we’re on the run.” </p><p>“I…” I muttered, trying to find words. “It’ll be dangerous to contact them. Too dangerous. You don’t need to take such a risk. I can handle myself.” </p><p>“I don’t have to, but you didn’t have to try and save me from them either. You could have left me to my fate, and that way, you wouldn’t have ended up somehow merging with a dragon heart. Yet, you did. Why should I do anything less?” </p><p>I shrugged, avoiding her gaze. I could see her desire to help me even if it would risk her, and I felt touched. It was a novel feeling to someone to risk their life for me. No one did that for me before. </p><p>I didn’t hate it. </p><p>I looked into her eyes, trying to understand her determination. “Are you sure? We’re already in a messy situation, and once we contact the tribes, things will get even more complicated. Maybe we don’t need to take such a risk?” </p><p>“No, we do,” she answered. “I might not be a fully-fledged healer, but I know enough not to delay any more than necessary. I have been diagnosing you during the trip. Whatever was going on your body cannot be delayed.” </p><p>“And, why the hurry?” I asked. </p><p>She frowned despite trying to keep her expression neutral. A transparent attempt not to alarm me. “Just sit down for a moment. I need to check a few things to make sure my conclusions are correct.” </p><p>I sat down and crossed my legs, while she stood behind me, pressing her hand to my back, on my heart. In that position, she could kill me easily, yet I trusted her.</p><p>It was a novel feeling. </p><p>As her magic invaded my body again, I felt a wetness on my back, suggesting that she was using another druidic ritual rather than an elemental spell, the feeling of mana was much different. I didn’t question her about what she had been doing, respecting her secrets. </p><p>“It’s just as I feared,” she said. </p><p>“Tell me,” I said. It was clearly bad news, but I wasn’t in a habit of denial. It was always better to confront things directly. </p><p>“The scale is not an exception,” she said. “I don’t understand exactly what’s going on, but it’s clear that absorbing mana is changing your body on a fundamental level. It’s probably the source of your sudden strength. But, with the way the scale shows on your arm, I’m afraid of where it’ll stop.” </p><p>“And, you want to find a shapeshifter to learn how to contain those changes.” </p><p>“That’s the only way I could think of, at least without accessing a real library, which is rather difficult under the circumstances.” </p><p>I nodded. She was right. Going anywhere near civilization was risky enough, especially anywhere that would hold the information we might need. I was tempted to ask if she had any good news, but I did not. I didn’t want to make her feel guilty. </p><p>She spoke nonetheless. “But, I have some good news,” she said. “A way to limit the mana absorption.” </p><p>“Oh, that’s good news. How, exactly?” I asked.</p><p>“The mana density in your body directly affects the absorption. The more mana there is, the faster the transformation. The less mana you hold in your body, the slower it’ll happen. That way, we will have more time to understand what’s going on.</p><p>“Is that right,” I said as I caught her gaze, checking to see if she had been blushing. She was not, which, for a moment, I found insulting. I didn’t expect her to get used to our way of … dealing with my excess mana that quickly. </p><p>Then, even when eye contact didn’t make her change her mind, I realized exactly what was going on. Lost in the seriousness of the moment, she had missed the implications of handling my mana build-up. </p><p>I decided to remind her of that. “So, we should handle that before hunting, right,” I said as I grabbed her hand, dragging her toward the spring. </p><p>“What do you—” she started, then gasped as a blush spread onto her face. </p><p>Perfect. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“It’s time to move,” I said the moment the sun disappeared at the horizon as I poked Lillian, pulling her out of her trance. “How was your trance? Any improvement?” </p><p>“Unbelievable,” she said. “Feel free to alert me whenever that mana build-up gets too much.” </p><p>I chuckled. “So, you only want to use me for my mana. How merciless,” I teased.</p><p>“Shut up,” she said, blushing. She slapped my arm, I just chuckled, ignoring the temptation to tell her that mana buildup had already reached a difficult degree. It would be fun …</p><p>But, just because there was no immediate sign of danger didn’t mean that we were safe. Even with the false trail, and unexpectedly large distance we managed to traverse, all it would take was one mistake for us to have a tail. </p><p>And, I much rather run away without dodging elemental spells. </p><p>“Hop on,” I said as I knelt, asking her to jump on my back. While it was more fun to carry her in a bridal hold, it was better to have my hands free. She did, and I started running at full speed, my enhanced senses allowing me to maintain awareness. </p><p>“Do you think we can arrive at the border in a week?” she asked. </p><p>“Depends on what we encounter,” I said. “However, assuming moderate trouble, a week should be doable with my sleep.” Then, I chuckled. “Assuming, of course, I can maintain my motivation. Running without resting is not easy.” </p><p>“What do you need?” she asked, worried. </p><p>“Well, I wouldn’t say no to the occasional kiss,” I said, which earned another playful slap. </p><p>“You’re a shameless rogue,” she growled, but it wasn’t enough to keep her giggles down. I gave her a heroic pose, which was already absurd enough under normal circumstances. And, with her on my shoulders, while I continued to run at full speed, its absurdity compounded even more. “Alright, I surrender. I’ll keep you entertained,” she surrendered before leaning and kissing me. </p><p>“Better, “ I said with exaggerated smugness. It kept me entertained, and it kept her distracted. Of course, distracting her like that had certain drawbacks, particularly when she put her hands on my hair, caressing it softly. That itself wasn’t too big of a problem, but soon her hands trailed down to my neck and shoulders, their dance more playful. “You’re pushing your luck,” I warned her. </p><p>“I don’t know what you mean,” she answered, not bothering to conceal her mirth. </p><p>“You’re lucky that we can’t waste the night time, or…” I said, growling in a way that I knew she liked. With our bodies connected, I could feel her heat up under that growl. Good, I wasn’t the only one that was being tortured. </p><p>“You’re a mean man, Marcus Scipio,” she called, pouting. I chuckled, which turned into a theme of our unusual trek through the forests of Western Gaul. We occasionally had the take wide turns, avoiding occasional villages or the hunting parties that had decided to stay outside overnight, but otherwise, the journey was monotonous. </p><p>Shockingly so, considering our circumstances. </p><p>Two things had played a role in our success. The first one was my senses. Not only I was able to detect the presence of any hunter, village, or even the occasional mage that might prove to be troubling, but also I was able to sense the beasts around us. And, since my detection was not limited to their mana presence but also factored in smell, sound, and vision, I was able to assess them even better. I knew which one I could ignore, and which I needed to avoid, which allowed me to even faster. </p><p>Then, we came across a checkpoint, which was sealed during the night. </p><p>One of the most important ways Rome maintained control of its provinces was the checkpoints. Every important mountain passage and bridge had provincial soldiers guarding it, collecting taxes and controlling movement at the same time. The assigned guards were often not very impressive, but they didn’t need to be. </p><p>Not when every checkpoint was equipped with giant bells that could be rung to alert the nearest legion, which sent somewhere between one contubernium — eight soldiers, usually led by an apprentice mage — to a century — eighty soldiers, led by a mage — to respond depending on the importance of the passage and the alert status. </p><p>Even mages couldn’t bypass those checkpoints easily, as they had at least one scout capable of detecting magic assigned to the area, and any magic attempt would be detected. So, unless someone could swim through a raging river, or climb through a beast-infested hill without using any magic, avoiding those checkpoints was very difficult. </p><p>It seemed that the Roman Republic didn’t consider someone to absorb a dragon heart to their body, combine it with some random druidic ritual and crazy failed breakthrough attempt to gain the exact ability to bypass those. </p><p>What an oversight! </p><p>Lillian didn’t seem to consider that fact, as she tensed on my shoulders. “Maybe we should wait until the morning,” she said. “That way, we can mix in with the merchants and travelers.” </p><p>“No need,” I said. “We can just bypass it.” </p><p>“We can’t,” she gasped in panic. “If we kill the checkpoint guards, there’ll be a manhunt! And, everything we have done will be for nothing—” she started before I reached up, pressing my finger against her lips. </p><p>“Calm down, sweetie. I know,” I said. “I have a simpler thing in mind. Think about how we escaped from the island. We’re going to do the same.” </p><p>She blushed. “Oh, I forgot about that,” she said. </p><p>“Don’t worry, it takes time to learn how to keep a cool head when facing emergencies. The key thing is to take a deep breath and consider every single solution first.” </p><p>“I … I will do better,” she promised. </p><p>“Don’t worry, and just hold tight,” I said as we moved away from the outpost, and instead went toward the most intimidating part of the hill. With my improved strength, I was able to climb through the face of the hill easily, </p><p>With that, I ignored the palisade that was built at the entrance, and started climbing the sharp hill with ease, Lillian’s weight on my back not even slowing down. Of course, the hill was dangerous for more than just the angle of the climb and unstable footage, but many beasts lived on it. Mostly birds, but there would be often Earth-natured snakes capable of digging tunnels, hunting those birds. </p><p>Not exactly simple opponents, making me glad for my ability to detect and avoid them with ease. And, just like that, what was supposed to be an impossible ordeal even for a four-element mage turned into a casual stroll. </p><p>I was getting more and more happy about my failed breakthrough. As long as everything went perfectly —</p><p>Just as I was thinking that, Lillian let out a fearful gasp, which scared me despite not having anything around. I reached for the stone knife reflexively even as I looked around. “What’s wrong!” I asked, looking for a threat, but finding none. </p><p>“Y-your body,” she stammered. </p><p>I bit down a dirty joke. I never heard her this shocked, not even when discussing my failed breakthrough. “Tell me, what’s going on?” </p><p>“I … I was just checking to understand how you can run that fast without tiring when … when…” she stammered, still shocked. I put her on the ground and grabbed her shoulders. </p><p>“Tell me,” I said, feeling unsettled by her reaction. </p><p>“Did you realize that your body is actually absorbing mana?” she asked. </p><p>I froze. </p><p>That was a good reason to panic. </p><p>“No, that’s impossible,” I said even as I closed my eyes and focused on my body. It was impossible. I couldn’t absorb mana directly. It was one of the cardinal rules of the world. Humans couldn’t absorb mana directly, and required vitae to do so. </p><p>Four-element vitae was the most common method, and there were other unique methods like shapeshifters, beast tamers, and druids, that either used different kinds of vitae or even used external mediums. But, across all those methods, one cardinal rule was never broken. Not even for sorcerers. </p><p>The human body couldn’t absorb mana directly. </p><p>I kept my eyes closed, watching the circulation of mana carefully, but failed to find it. “Focus on your legs,” Lillian commented. </p><p>I focused on my legs, understanding the rationale immediately. It was the part that had been exhausted the most. I watched the mana circulate around … and a minuscule part of it suddenly disappeared. </p><p>I wanted to deny what was going on, but denying the obvious was the domain of the stupid and the dead. Instead, I pulled my knife, and stabbed my arm, avoiding veins. Lillian gasped in shock, but I ignored her complaints as I focused on the mana flow. </p><p>The mana gathered to the wound, directly being absorbed as it helped me recover. “Impossible,” I muttered, ignoring the sudden sense of hunger that accompanied the sudden recovery. </p><p>However, when I rubbed off the blood, another nasty surprise was waiting for me. </p><p>A small scale. Solitary and glowing… </p><p>“Do we—” Lillian said, but I interrupted her. </p><p>“No, ignore it,” I said. “The plan stays the same. I’ll do my best not to get hurt, we’ll spend more time experimenting once we find a mana-dense location.” My tone was rude and sharp, but Lillian just nodded. </p><p>And, I continued running. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Lillian was sniffing hungrily as she stepped out of the cave, looking far better. </p><p>“Good morning, sleepyhead,” I greeted cheerfully once I stopped chewing my food and waved to her. She looked at me, smiling at first, then her expression turned serious. “What’s wrong?” I asked. </p><p>“What are doing?” she asked as she pointed the hide in my hand, which I had been sanding to get rid of the blood and the meat layer. </p><p>“Well, I’m tanning the hide,” I explained. </p><p>Her eyebrows rose. “No, you’re not tanning it, you’re murdering the poor thing,” she said as she walked toward me. </p><p>I shrugged, surprised by her vehemence. It wasn’t something I expected her to react to, not with the way she treated the mere act of mending clothes as an incomprehensible language. She grabbed the hide, but as she raised her hand, she froze. “Can I use magic?” </p><p>“As long as it’s a simple spell,” I said, curious about what she had in mind. </p><p>I watched in surprise as she put her hand on the hide, and a small blade of water appeared at the edge, scraping most of the mess I had created. At the same time, she pulled some of the water from the hide, drying it like it was under direct sun for a week, and cleaned it further. </p><p>Merely a minute later, I was looking for a hide perfectly prepared for making clothes. “Where did that come from?” I asked. </p><p>She blushed. “I was responsible for processing the fur and leather of the second-order beasts, especially the ones too fragile for ordinary methods,” she said as she avoided my gaze, suddenly shy. I recognized it as what it was. </p><p>She had been a part of the noble family, and unlike me, she was not effectively exiled. While the noble circles appreciated certain types of crafts, actually dabbling in anything with actual utility was seen as servant work. </p><p>“Yet, you can’t sew,” I chuckled. </p><p>“I don’t need it, do I? After all, I have you.” </p><p>“True,” I said with a chuckle, decidedly ignoring her blush getting more intense. I wasn’t ready to acknowledge the subtext she had put there. Not when we were still busy running away. “Do you think you can use the same trick to make some dried meat? Our journey will be much easier if we can carry it rather than hunting at every spot.” </p><p>“It should be doable,” she said as she took a step toward the carcass. </p><p>“Eat first,” I said as I pointed at the small flame, where five large pieces of meat were slowly sizzling. “It has been a long day.” </p><p>“Roasted meat for breakfast. Unusual,” she muttered. “But I guess I should embrace the camping experience.” </p><p>It was a poor attempt to deflect the true nature of our situation, but I rewarded it with a soft giggle. She looked happy with her small success as she walked to the fire. “Isn’t it a bit much for both of us?” she said. “Even cooked, it’ll spoil in a couple days.” </p><p>”Believe me, it’s not,” I said as I finished my piece, took another … and another. Then, under her astonished gaze, I put another five pounds of meat to the fire. </p><p>Only then, did she pay attention to the boar, and realize how much of the meat was missing. “What’s going on?” she asked, her tone serious. </p><p>“I’m guessing it’s a side effect of all the physical effort I had put in. I’m feeling famished,” I explained. </p><p>“And, you just started eating without asking me to check first. Come here!” she said. </p><p>I didn’t expect it to help, but playing along was easier, particularly since her sudden anger came from a place of caring. I sat next to her, and she put her hand on my chest. Once again, I felt her elemental energies turn gentle as they infused my body. </p><p>I closed my eyes, using it as an opportunity to look inward, trying to see if something was wrong … but saw nothing. Well, not nothing. My body was still filled with impossible amounts of mana, I still had a crystal lodged in the middle of my heart, radiating even more mana, and my elemental cores still floated around that crystal, drained of their vitae. </p><p>I ignored the temptation of trying to repair them. I wondered whether they could be recovered, or at least I could reconstruct new elemental cores with the infinite mana that was flooding my body. As much as throwing away the effort that took a decade was a great loss, but creating new ones would be much faster with infinite mana. </p><p>However, neither option was I willing to attempt right now. Be it repairing or reconstructing, neither activity would be very subtle. Add in the risk of an injury, at it would be madness to attempt them before I was nestled in a more mana-dense location, preferably at the other side of the border where our mysterious followers couldn’t chase after us casually. </p><p>“Everything looks fine,” Lillian said after a long period of silence, her hand still on my chest. She looked relieved, but also perplexed. “Too fine. Not even the slightest strain, like you have been resting for a week.” She caught my gaze, her expression an interesting mix of frustration and fascination. “How the hell are you not an exhausted pile right now! Any apprentice mage would have died of exhaustion. Even a shapeshifter, with their legendary endurance, would have collapsed.” </p><p>She had a point. What I had done was outrageous, and so were the improvements I had received. Unfortunately, I had no answer, so I just shrugged. “You know as much as I do. Even my extremely risky plan only required me to mix four vitae into one. The dragon heart following that and invading my body was unexpected. Maybe it was your ‘healing’ spell that worked.” </p><p>“No, that’s impossible,” she said. </p><p>“Why?” I asked, and she blushed. </p><p>“Technically, it was not a healing spell,” she admitted. I quirked an eyebrow. She hurriedly continued. “It has some healing effect as well, it was why I had used it, but originally, it was one of the rituals the druids of the olden times used while tending their grooves of great ancestral trees.” </p><p>“Explain,” I said, my voice sharp. As much as I wanted to ignore it, I was unsettled with the changes. Any answer, no matter how minuscule, was completely helpful. </p><p>She blushed even harder. “I … I don’t know much. Most of the secrets had been lost. What do you know about great trees?” </p><p>“Other than they could actually uproot and attack, which allowed them to resist the Roman Legions for almost thirty years before they were defeated, nothing,” I said. “How does it relate to … whatever you have done?”  </p><p>She took a deep breath. “It’s complicated, and most of its secrets are lost, but as far as I could understand, those trees carry the imprints of the beasts and people that died in the groove. Those imprints need appeasement occasionally. The ritual calms them down and also heals the tree.” </p><p>“And, you used that ritual because?” </p><p>“Because it has healing as a side effect. With the beasts attacking and you unconscious, I didn’t exactly have a lot of options. That was the fastest option. Just a quick blood sacrifice and I didn’t have to interrupt my other spells.” </p><p>“Do you remember anything during the ritual? Anything else that made you choose that instead of something else?” </p><p>“I … I don’t know. It was all a blur,” she admitted, blushing. “I thought that I had felt some kind of presence, similar to what I had felt when I visited the remains of one of the holy groves, as if some kind of soul imprint was roaring in anger.” </p><p>“Good to know,” I said, ignoring my desire to shout at her for neglecting to mention such an important detail. It was understandable that she had ignored that detail with everything that had been going on since that spectacular failure. </p><p>And, looking back, there was nothing I could do differently. It warned me that the sudden strong emotions I had been feeling might not belong to me, but even before knowing the exact details, I did my best to control them. </p><p>After all, a sudden flood of mana was enough as a warning. Even with the benefit of hindsight, there was nothing I would have done differently during the escape. </p><p>Silence ruled the groove we focused on eating. She ate several bites more, and I ate several pounds more. Once she finished eating, she started experimenting, trying to figure out how to make dried meat. It didn’t take long for her to come up with a method. It wasn’t perfect. I doubted the meat she prepared could barely last a week, but considering I had finished almost half of the wild boar before I finally started to feel satiated,  I doubted it would be a problem. </p><p>The silence soon turned charged when I asked her to remove her shirt so I could mend them. She put her hand on my bicep and whispered. “I … I think I need more mana,” she whispered. </p><p>I smirked. “That, I can help with.” </p><p>After all, we still had a few hours to kill. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I didn’t spend much time setting the cameras, just enough to make sure the angles were decent, before I walked back to her, and captured her lips. She abandoned herself into the kiss while my hand canned over her naked breasts. She gasped in pleasure as she looked somewhere over my shoulder. </p><p>Normally, I didn’t appreciate such drifting attention, but I decided to make an exception under the circumstances. After all, she was still paying attention to us, just on how we looked on the screen. </p><p>And, it worked, turning her panties even more drenched. And, that was not the only difference. She reached my zipper with her trembling fingers and freed my shaft. One of her hands stayed there, the other struggling to get rid of my shirt and pants, but her trembling fingers failed in their tasks. </p><p>“You’re overdressed for what you want me to do,” she whispered desperately. I decided to help her, curious about what she would do. I quickly got rid of the rest of my clothes, surpassing her in terms of nudity. </p><p>Though, considering she was wearing only a drenched pair of panties, which, at this point, hid nothing, the difference was largely academic. </p><p> “Alright. I’m under your command,” I said. She shivered, but I doubted it had anything to do with the chill of the basement, not when her skin was burning, her arousal like a furnace. </p><p>“Good,” she said as she pushed me down, but not before checking the cameras once more. I didn’t miss the fact that she pushed me down at the intersection of three cameras. But, when I opened my mouth to comment on it, I failed, because she sat on my midsection, not even bothering to remove her panties. She just slid them to the side…</p><p>And, I found myself engulfed in her wetness, a moan occupying my mouth. Her hands landed on my chest for support. Necessary, because her calves were trembling desperately, threatening her with an imminent collapse as she found herself filled with excitement. </p><p>“W-we look amazing,” she uttered as she looked at the screen, showing the extent of her exhibitionist habits. I didn’t have any complaints, as, her hips rocked with a speed she had never achieved before as her carnal desires drove her. </p><p>“Imagine what our viewers would think,” I said, which wasn’t as theoretical as I led Emily to believe. Tara was upstairs, receiving her reward. </p><p>Still, the moment I said that, I realized I might have miscalculated the arousal she was feeling. My words proved to be the last straw for her quivering legs. Her wetness flowed even faster as she started trembling, and collapsed against my chest. </p><p>“Come on, sweetie. That was quick, even for you,” I said even as I flipped us, and started invading her core. With her ongoing orgasm, it was particularly effective. She moaned, any chance of stifling it even somewhat long gone. </p><p>“I …” she said, which was all she was able to say. </p><p>“Come on, Emily. You can do better. Think of our viewers,” I said as I slapped her breast gently, then grabbed her nipple between my fingers. That didn’t exactly help her contain her desperate moans. </p><p>“Y-you’re right,” she muttered as she pushed back. I let her do so, curious exactly what she had in mind. She quickly shifted on all fours, checking herself on the camera to make sure her position was good. “Let’s put on a show,” she whispered. </p><p>“What an excellent idea,” I said as I slid inside her, taking her from behind as her back arched, putting an excellent pose. However, despite her initiative, I could see that her arms were trembling too badly to keep her upright for more than a few seconds. So, I grabbed her arms, pulled her back, and started invading her core mercilessly. </p><p>Emily moaned even louder as my pull raised her body, her tits dancing with each push. Her tightness around me was spectacular. </p><p>Then, I decided to escalate the situation. I made a show of my shock as I leaned forward, and whispered in fake panic. “I just remembered something important. My villainess boss has access to that computer. She might be watching.” </p><p>Emily gasped even louder as I stopped, but I didn’t let her go. She was still in a doggy position with her arms being pulled, so even as she looked at me, it was a uniquely erotic sight. “Y-you’re telling me that we might have an actual audience,” she whispered, her voice layered with shock and pleasure. </p><p>Luckily, my power allowed me to realize that there was no risk. “Probably. I might check if you want,” I added. </p><p>She paused for a moment, and the silence ruled the room while she bit her lips thoughtfully. “Well, it would be a pity to cut our show,” she suddenly whispered, and pushed herself back despite the challenging pose, devouring my shaft once more. </p><p>Due to my power, it didn’t come as a surprise, but some things didn’t need to be a surprise to bring joy. </p><p>I started moving once more as she tightened around me even more, her enthusiasm about the possibility of having a real audience driving her forward even more. </p><p>Her exhibitionism was developing to a surprising degree, not that I was complaining. </p><p>I continued ramming her while she made no attempt to contain her moans, the pleasure turning overwhelming. “Tell me what do you want?” I ordered. </p><p>”Just fuck me, you bastard. Fuck me hard!” she moaned desperately. Honest, but a touch louder than her usual attitude, showing that she still played for the camera. </p><p>“As you wish,” I said as I suddenly changed position, and lifted her to my lap, still inside her as I started walking toward one of the cameras, wanting to give an even better view. </p><p>“Oh, yes!” Emily moaned as she looked at the screen, this time showing her beautiful body from close up. </p><p>“I wonder if that villainess is masturbating to our show,” I suddenly said, and she tightened even more. She tried to suppress a moan, but that failed spectacularly. Instead, she just cried desperately, her mouth refusing her orders to close as the pleasure invaded her even more. </p><p>\"Please... Please... Fuck me harder,” she begged with a series of whimpers. I fulfilled her desire by moving even faster, using the leverage of our position to the limit. </p><p>“How about we add something even more fun,” I said as I shifted my hand slightly so it was against her clit, the dance of my fingers pushing her already desperate arousal to a point she had never felt before. </p><p>Her hands turned little fists as she tried to resist the pleasure, but failed spectacularly. The pleasure invaded her whole being, and she just found herself watching herself on the screen while moaning repeatedly. </p><p>When I finally cummed, filling her core, it had become too much. She shivered as the pleasure invaded her, her eyes closing. “I … I need to rest,” she admitted. </p><p>“As you wish. We still have a lot of work to do as well,” I said as I pulled out, then put her on the floor, watching as her naked chest rose and fell. It was a spectacular moment … and still being recorded. </p><p>I just hoped Tara was happy with her reward. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Let’s stop the dinner,” Aisnam said halfway toward the second dish, which surprised me. </p><p>“Is there something wrong with the food?” I asked. I didn’t need to fake my worry. Maintaining Aisnam’s good mood was very important for my immediate future, particularly since I wanted to continue laundering cultivation techniques through the System with her as the medium. </p><p>She chuckled. “No, but I can see your enthusiasm about the techniques, so I thought that we could start studying them.” </p><p>“Really?” I said happily, with no need to fake my enthusiasm. I was actually enthusiastic about trying to understand the techniques together. I had long realized that, when it came to cultivation, Aisnam had extraordinary talent, allowing her to grow even under the suppression of her family. </p><p>Her talent was not as perverse as Pearyin showed, but hers were far more balanced. Pearyin’s talent was either perfect or non-existent depending on the topic. </p><p>Then three techniques I had received were valuable, each for different reasons. While my own superior skill level in palm techniques allowed me to defeat the cultivators easily, most of them, I had just overwhelmed through superior application of skill. </p><p>The only exception was the cultivator that used the palm technique. Even though his palm technique was very different than Verdant palm, both in terms of elemental conception and martial application, I was actually able to read his attack. </p><p>By adding a saber and a dagger technique into the mix, I hoped that, at a minimum, I would receive the ability to predict them. If I was lucky, those techniques might even help me learn the rewards. </p><p>After all, it wasn’t the first time I had used the System to receive a superior version of a technique. Black Tiger Onslaught Martial art, I received the same way, which was, for all intents and purposes, an advanced version of the traditional Tiger Fist. While my pill-enhanced martial talent meant I could have learned it either way, I could see that the expertise of its earlier form would help their learning greatly. </p><p>If it worked the same way, maybe I could learn the advanced variants of the same techniques without help. </p><p>It was the only path I had to learn the advanced versions. </p><p>“Of course. They will be interesting to work for me as well,” she said, and we moved to the training room. “Which one would you like to start with?” </p><p>“Let’s try with the dagger technique,” I said. “I’m in the process of comprehending a dagger-based martial art. It might help my comprehending a martial intent.” </p><p>“Worth a try,” she said as she sat next to me, and we started studying the dagger technique together. “The core of this dagger technique lies in misdirection, like the glimmer of light being reflected off a mirror…” she started explaining. </p><p>It was a quick start, suggesting that she had already studied them to draw some insights before gifting them to me. </p><p>Even better. </p><p>At this point, our study sessions had become familiar. Most importantly, she had long stopped bothering about whether an answer to her question would be too complicated or meaningless, and answered them even if it was a complicated one. I had convinced her that those complicated answers actually helped me make some interesting connections. </p><p>In reality, I merely used the System-granted knowledge to cheat. As long as her answers were complicated and accurate, the System didn’t care while multiplying, allowing us to jump levels. </p><p>However, as she delivered the lesson, we hit an unexpected snag. Another cultivator was approaching the capital. I didn’t need to react immediately, as he was just detected by the outer layer of the newly improved formation, and he was almost five hundred miles away. </p><p>He wasn’t very fast. He wouldn’t be able to arrive at the capital before dawn. </p><p>Aisnam explained the technique for an hour. “That’s all I know about this technique,” she said with a finality in her tone. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 50; Pampering Bonus - 75 (Capped)]</p><p>[125x Return - Five Draws Illusionary Dagger - Beginner, Major Familiarity]</p><p>I triggered it immediately, letting the information fill my mind. At this moment, I could easily handle that jump while keeping it hidden. </p><p>“Thank you,” I said even as I grabbed a dagger, indeed trying to deduce a martial arts technique based on the concept of illusory speed. The knowledge of cultivation, combined with my martial arts talent, allowed me to compile a decent one. </p><p>I waved my dagger around, showing off my findings. Of course, what I displayed to Aisnam was a flashier, incomplete, and cumbersome version that nonetheless required a great amount of skill. The last thing I needed was for her to actually get the idea of using my martial arts talent for practical purposes. </p><p>Luckily, Aisnam was proud and amused by my achievement, even though it was ultimately useless. Though, it was probably nicer to call it a martial art that took the art portion too seriously. </p><p>While I showed off my martial technique to Aisnam, I also processed the actual technique. As the name implied, the technique had five moves, each with a different effect. The one that had been used against me was the second draw, and my opponent had managed to reach Minor Familiarity. </p><p>Not bad, considering all he had was a damaged book with most of it missing. </p><p>“Now, the next technique,” I asked Aisnam with wide eyes. Now that I knew that the method was solid, I could always convince her for another lesson a few days later. Ultimately, more techniques was nice, but their expertise was supplementary. </p><p>Even a hundred techniques wouldn’t be as useful as formations, which allowed me to detect, avoid, and protect as I wished. </p><p>My enthusiasm helped Aisnam deal with the stress of the day … which was nowhere as bad as it could have been since she was still unaware of the bounty on her. Though, maybe I should let one of the weaker ones slip to alert her. </p><p>No, I decided to send another letter from her ‘ally’ which would also explain the situation in more detail, including the excuse I had used against the cultivators I let go. That way, she wouldn’t misjudge the situation, and could use it for her political purposes if needed. </p><p>For the next two hours, we repeated the same trick with the other two techniques. However, during those two hours, another cultivator had arrived in my detection range. It looked like I would be having a busy time soon. </p><p>The System managed to rescue my mood. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 50; Pampering Bonus - 75 (Capped)]</p><p>[125x Return - Fierce Palm of Four Waves - Beginner, Perfection]</p><p>[125x Return - Merciless Landslide of Three Swings - Beginner]</p><p>Her explanations lasted more or less the same, but the difference in her comprehension made a great difference. She was already an expert in palm techniques, which allowed her to understand the palm technique with a much greater capability. On the other hand, the saber was traditionally treated as a male-oriented weapon, and her experience was clearly lacking. </p><p>Luckily, with the assistance of the System, it was still triggered. </p><p>The contrast between the two techniques was interesting. Fierce Palm of Four Waves was a very interesting technique. The wave implied a certain gentleness and evasiveness, yet it had the fierce as a part of its name. </p><p>As competence reaching perfection filled my mind, I had to admit that the naming was accurate. The technique was based on being evasive like water, accumulating energy before finishing it with one barbaric hit. </p><p>Meanwhile, the saber technique was even more direct than its name implied. It had three moves, but all three of them maximized the death and devastation Qi might cause, with no regard to evasion and defense. One had to be a madman to have options, yet still cultivate this as their main technique. </p><p>I suspected the cultivation world didn’t lack such madmen. </p><p>Aisnam hadn’t been very interested in the martial variant of the palm technique, but had the opposite attitude toward the saber art, filled with sharp, domineering strikes. </p><p>“… How about this,” I said as I used a training saber to smash a reinforced training dummy. </p><p>“Excellent move. Show the next one,” Aisnam said, very interested in watching me. I smiled even as I showed off another technique based on the conception of a landslide, amused by her fascination. </p><p>It had nothing to do with the technique itself, and all about how I looked as I used the saber technique. I had already removed my shirt, and my upper body was glistening with exertion, every swing reinforcing my aura. </p><p>I was more like an actor in one of the movies who removed their shirt for no reason for the audience. Aisnam tried to hide it, but I was too familiar with her blush and the way she bit her lips to miss it. </p><p>I felt like a stripper rather than a warrior … in a good way. </p><p>I showed off for five more minutes, before my beautiful Queen let out a guttural sound and stood up, walking toward me hungrily. “That’s enough practicing. Let’s spar!” </p><p>There wasn’t much sparring… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Aisnam was being targeted. </p><p>The challenge I was facing was supposed to be scary, yet, I didn’t have much fear. It was arrogance, I knew, but the sight of a Fifth Stage cultivator, not only running away, but also thanking me for merely robbing him rather than killing him was enough to make it hard to feel humble.</p><p>I had to remember the Golden Core cultivator attacking the protective artifact to keep that arrogance under control. “There’s always someone stronger,” I muttered before I stopped pondering over what had just happened. </p><p>There were a lot of things that needed to be done to deal with the new threat. I should not only redo the passive detection formation and make it more sensitive, but also I needed to set up several traps and safe houses in case an enemy that I couldn’t defeat arrived, giving me a chance to evacuate Aisnam. </p><p>“However, first, the loot,” I said as I poked his bag from a distance, using a stick to reverse its contents. I didn’t expect any nasty surprise, but there was no harm in being careful. </p><p>There wasn’t much. A few essence pills for martial arts, about thirty broken spirit stones, and a few flame talismans that looked old enough that they might actually crumble when used. No wonder he was tempted by the idea of the bounty. </p><p>His lack of wealth wasn’t surprising. My long stay at the cultivation market gave me a lot of information about the way they lived. Itinerant cultivators, at least, the smart ones, didn’t try to accumulate riches, but instead spent their money for cultivation resources. </p><p>Stupid ones didn’t live very long. </p><p>Then, I turned my attention to the real valuable item. The book, radiated enough presence for me to notice. I grabbed and flipped it. “A technique manual, excellent,” I muttered. </p><p>Five Draws Illusionary Dagger.</p><p>It was an old, tattered book, large sections of it missing. Apparently, it was supposed to have five moves, but only the portion that was about the second portion had survived, describing something similar to the attack I received. </p><p>But not exactly. </p><p>I didn’t try to learn it. I was a cultivator, which meant that the techniques weren’t as incomprehensible to me as before, but that didn’t change my lack of inherent talent. I would still require a lot of time to decipher a technique, and even longer to actually develop any proficiency. Weeks, maybe months. </p><p>And, that was assuming I could actually practice a half-complete technique without hurting myself. The guy who had run away must have possessed a decent talent in dagger techniques to successfully cultivate it. </p><p>Luckily, I had a way to repair it. All I needed was to find a way to pass that to Aisnam indirectly, and use the techniques t</p><p>I was also tempted to bring it to Pearyin, and see if her talent would work equally impressively, but after some consideration, I decided against it. I had already seen that her incredible comprehension was very streaky — she was able to learn a palm technique in moments, but still struggling with the basics of calligraphy. </p><p>An incomplete technique was not a good test. </p><p>I put the useful items into my storage ring, burned the rest, and returned to the capital, however, I didn’t return to Spring Palace. </p><p>Instead, I started laying down another detection formation, one that would challenge my improved formation skill to the limit. This time, I decided to draw it in three layers. </p><p>The first layer covered only the capital and a mile around it, filled with enough nodes to catch a hint of Qi even if the cultivator was trying to hide. The second layer used the previous formation, and covered the hundred-mile radius. </p><p>The third layer covered much more. I had particularly focused on the road between the capital and Markas, adding enough nodes to give me an even better detection. </p><p>It was a good thing that I did so. While I was busy with the mess, I detected six more itinerant cultivators, all coming directly from the direction of the cultivation market, as if they had been racing for a reward. </p><p>I confronted them. Their reactions were more or less the same as the first attempt. They challenged me cautiously, but once they had been defeated, they were quick to surrender and postulate themselves. I questioned every single one of them. Since I had a better idea of what had been going on, I was able to ask more pointed questions. </p><p>Apparently, the bounty had been declared at midnight at the cultivator market, but they had been informed about it by their allies who used some one-time communication talisman, and they rushed forward to be the first ones to catch the opportunity. Their speed implied that they were already living in the Zaim Kingdom, or at least the wilderness between kingdoms. </p><p>It meant, there would be a lot of itinerant cultivators moving forward. </p><p>I welcomed it, particularly since it gave me a chance to finally increase my technique repertoire. </p><p>Unfortunately, not all of them had been carrying technique manuals with them. Out of the next five, only two of them had them, and both were mostly scraps. I wondered how many times they had come close to death trying to learn those techniques. </p><p>A palm technique called Fierce Palm of Four Waves, and a saber technique called the Merciless Landslide of the Three Swings. </p><p>The techniques seemed to be pretty simplistic, but that didn’t bother me. After all, as long as I could use Aisnam to upgrade them, it should be alright. I didn’t have the talent to cultivate the dagger and the saber techniques, and while my own palm technique knowledge might allow me to attempt learning Fierce Palm of Four Waves, I still wanted to see if I could receive a complete version first. </p><p>I continued laying down the formations even as I considered the sequence of events, and the sudden proliferation of cultivator attackers. From a larger scheme, their numbers weren’t too great, but not too low either. </p><p>It was likely that I wasn’t the only cultivator who decided to grow a small garden to support their cultivation. Of course, without sharing my advantages, they were nowhere near enough to match my success. They might generate enough to avoid starvation, maybe even enough to cultivate while they were still in the early stages, but that would be the limit for most. </p><p>However, that conclusion meant that they wouldn’t be the only itinerant cultivators that arrived. There would be others who tried their luck, and the more I rebuffed them, the higher the risk would get… Sooner or later, the ones behind the bounty would make a move. </p><p>They would either increase the bounty, enough to attract late-stage cultivators; or intervene directly, risking revealing their hand. </p><p>I wondered which option they would choose … but either way, I wasn’t scared. My discussions with Aisnam had already revealed that the argument between the family branches wouldn’t justify the mobilization of the Foundation Establishment elders, and anything weaker was not intimidating.</p><p>I had to admit, that finally having the confidence not to run away at the sight of the slightest trouble was a satisfying development. </p><p>It had been the four most difficult months of my life. </p><p>While I was dealing with the mess, I didn’t neglect to deliver the books to Aisnam indirectly. However, to prevent from disappearing halfway, I kept an eye on the process, while, at the same time, improving the formation around the capital even more — just because I was confident to defend myself didn’t mean I wouldn’t further turn things to my benefit. </p><p>The books, I packed with an old tarp and led a few guards who had been chasing a thief to it. Once the guards discovered the books, they were quick to realize those were too valuable for them to touch. Guards delivered it to their captain, the captain to one of the new ministers. </p><p>And, the new minister brought them to the Queen, earning a minor noble title for his efforts. Guard captain received a promotion, and guards received a hundred gold coins each for their great contribution. </p><p>Showing that, many things might be different in this new world, but the greed of bosses was not one of them. </p><p>I returned to the Spring Palace around midnight. I waited that much, because, thanks to the new formation, I could detect Aisnam’s location far more accurately. </p><p>She came carrying a small bundle. I greeted her with a kiss and a home-cooked meal. Once she extracted herself, she smiled. “I have a surprise for you,” she said as she opened the bundle, revealing three familiar books. “I know how much you like trying to decipher cultivation skills to support your martial arts,” she said as she passed them. </p><p>Her tone put a smile on my face as much as the success of my ploy. It was amusing. It was an indulgent smile, the kind a highly successful banker might wear while she gave a gift to her painter lover. Happy with the impact, but ultimately treating it as no more than a toy. </p><p>Of course, their real use was different. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 50; Pampering Bonus - 75 (Capped)]</p><p>[125x Return - Nine Draws Mirage Dagger, Cultivation Technique - Black-Low Grade]</p><p>[125x Return - Furious Palm of Nine Tsunami - Yellow-Peak Grade]</p><p>[125x Return - Desolate Quake of Seven Swings, Cultivation Technique - Yellow-Peak Grade]</p><p>Another day, another victory. </p><p>Now, I just needed to see if I could use the existing books into a lesson. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Even as I was running toward my first potential direct confrontation with a cultivator, what I was feeling was not fear, but excitement. </p><p>“Something must be wrong with me,” I muttered, but even as I said that I knew exactly where that feeling had been coming from. I had always been a competitive person, and liked to be better than other people. Not exactly the most flattering self-perception, but also true. </p><p>Otherwise, I wouldn’t have spent my life trying to be a world-class sprinter before everything had been derailed by an injury and I stumbled into my career as a professional boy toy. </p><p>My attitude was much different than the time I was trying to visit the cultivation market. Back then, cultivation was still a mystery. I had no idea what I would find at the market, armed with nothing but a bunch of defensive talismans. </p><p>Seeing that crazy swordsman Xantum casually slaughtering others hadn’t particularly helped me to calm down — thanks to every divine being he turned out to be the kind of outlier like a natural disaster than a normal encounter, closer to a meteor strike than a flood. </p><p>This time, I was more confident. Be it direct combat techniques or indirect support skills, I was strong enough to compete against even Peak Qi Gathering cultivators directly, and even if they had some surprises, I had more than enough surprises of my own. </p><p>Particularly with my formation skill taking the next step, allowing me to assemble formations much faster. Not instantly, but enough to turn a strategic tool into a tactical one. </p><p>“First time for everything,” I muttered as I moved to meet with the approach of the cultivator. The detection radius of my formations spread a hundred miles away from the capital, but I managed to catch up with him when he was still ninety miles away. </p><p>I observed him from a great distance, keeping my presence concealed just like he had been trying to do. A man, middle-aged, wearing coarse linen clothing, with a sheathed dagger the only weapon he was carrying. And, he had a large sack in his back. </p><p>An itinerant cultivator. </p><p>I wasn’t immediately able to pin down his exact stage, because he was trying to keep his cultivation hidden even as he ran. Just like me, he was trying to keep his cultivation hidden through martial skill — many itinerant cultivators did that. Unfortunately, he was nowhere near as skilled as a martial artist to do so against me. </p><p>A Bone Forging Martial artist, and Qi cultivator who was somewhere between the Third and Fifth stages. </p><p>I could easily ambush him, but I chose not to. He was not a threat, but a valuable source of information. I needed to understand why he suddenly appeared, and how it would go. </p><p>I moved a few miles back, and first prepared to set a formation that I could hide under just in case. I was confident in confronting him, but only an idiot wouldn’t take a safety measure that would only take a few seconds. </p><p>There was a nice valley that intersected with the path of the cultivator, which had a good geography that would help me to set the formation. At my level, I wasn’t restricted to geography anymore, but it would still quicken the process. I waved my hand, and a few strings of Qi spread around the valley, creating seven nodes to lay concealment and a protection formation. It could defend against a Peak Qi cultivator attack once, but if the need arose, I could reinforce it further. </p><p>With my escape path prepared, I stepped away from the valley, and started waiting for the cultivator behind a tree. I changed my clothes and put on a mask, and when he was near enough, I jumped to his path. </p><p>“Hello, fellow cultivator,” I said casually, which contrasted with the way I flared my Qi, and his face blanched. </p><p>“Fellow cultivator,” he replied, his tone respectable but tense as his eyes darted around, trying to assess my cultivation, and indirectly, his chances of success if he decided to fight. </p><p>From what I could gather, the confrontations between cultivators often turned into fighting, but it was not common for them to end up in death. Between itinerant cultivators, fighting was often a way to probe their general skill. The rest of the discussion went based on the difference in strength, especially when the stakes were not personal. </p><p>The stronger cultivators didn’t casually kill the weaker ones, because fighting was expensive in terms of Qi, not to mention there were many ways a weaker cultivator could harm a stronger one. </p><p>Assuming, the difference in strength was not an insurmountable gulf. </p><p>Now that we were closer, and I was flaring my Qi freely, I could see that he was at the Sixth Stage. Three levels above me. I was merely at the Third Stage, but with my Gate Transformation Technique at Major Integration, they were robust enough to match the output of a Fifth Stage. </p><p>The attack came in the form of a merciless slash, fast and flowing. His dagger jumped out, and half of his body was alight with Qi. A part of me, after years of living on Earth, shouted at me to run away, which was the appropriate response when a madman with a knife attacked. </p><p>It was even more intimidating when the said knife was covered with glowing Qi that lengthened the dagger five times, moving in an intricate pattern, like he was trying to attack the five locations at once, making it very difficult to understand. </p><p>As he attacked, his cultivation became even clearer. Fifth Stage. </p><p>I was unable to predict where was trying to attack. Retreating was the safest option … but I chose something different. I raised my palm, and waved gently. My Qi responded by spreading like a blanket in an effort to deflect all five attacks. </p><p>Three of the attacks had turned illusionary, while the other two had been deflected easily, the difference in skill levels proving vital. His Qi dagger attack was sharp and deadly, but my curtain of Qi embodied the concept of the Verdant Palm to a degree that was supposed to be impossible. </p><p>I felt a tension in me unravel. Even with all my advantages, a part of me had been afraid, that I wouldn’t be able to deal with the unfamiliar attack and would be defeated before reacting. But, it looked like I had underestimated the palm technique. I prepared for the second round…</p><p>Only to find the nameless cultivator kneeling in front of me. “Senior,” he said, his tone filled with fear and reverence in equal amounts, showing total submission, showing that he was ready to pay a lot for his disrespect. </p><p>Alright, maybe I was still underestimating the importance of such a great skill. </p><p>“Speak, what are you doing here?” I said. </p><p>“I’m here for the bounty, senior,” he replied readily. I didn’t bother asking who was the bounty target. It was clearly Aisnam. “I didn’t know such an esteemed one like yourself was interested in it. My apologies.”</p><p>“Which bounty?” I asked, deciding that it was a good way to ask that question. </p><p>“The one from Linnass, senior,” he said </p><p>“A mere mortal kingdom. I thought that finally, her family had decided to put a bounty,” I said. “What’s the bounty?” I said. </p><p>“Two hundred spirit stones, and a Profound artifact,” he said. </p><p>I frowned. It was an impressive amount. While the treasury of the mortal kingdoms might have more, they were under the protection of the cultivation families. Of course, such a bounty was not the fair price for a cultivator of Eight Stage, but it was very generous for an injured cultivator of Second Stage who struggled against martial artists even with the help of an artifact. </p><p>I had to admit, it was a nice ploy. There were only two possibilities. Either Aisnam had used her last trump card, and the assassins would be able to get rid of him easily; or she had more trump cards, and they would be revealed. </p><p>A cheap way for the rival faction of her family to get rid of her. </p><p>As I processed the effectiveness of the trick, I realized another reason why cultivators hadn’t taken over mortal kingdoms, which wasn’t fully restricted by their Pact. By taking the role of the Queen Regent, Aisnam had turned herself into an easy target, where the itinerant cultivators could target her with the flimsiest of excuses. </p><p>Cultivator politics were complicated. </p><p>“And, you want to move immediately, instead of discovering the reason for bounty?” I asked. </p><p>“This junior is stupid and impatient,” he said. “I didn’t know Senior was protecting her.” </p><p>“Not a problem. Mistakes are the domain of youth,” I said, acting like an old man. “It just shows in your lack of experience. You’re lucky to survive and learn.” </p><p>I was talking to gain some time. I wasn’t willing to kill him, and while I could break his cultivation for his ‘disrespect’ I didn’t want to do it either. Not because I was being too merciful … but I was wondering the best way to manipulate him.</p><p>It clicked. </p><p>“Another lesson. Don’t forget, small fish is not tasty,” I said. </p><p>His eyes widened. “You mean.” </p><p>“Exactly. I’m here because I expect them to increase the bounty. I will only act once the bounty rises to a point that satisfies me,” I said, giving a reasonable excuse for my intervention. Whether the ones behind it would believe, I didn’t know, but it was worth a try. “Now, leave your sack and the book that’s hidden under your shirt, but you can keep your dagger,” I said, like I wasn’t robbing him. </p><p>“Thank you, Senior,” he said as he followed my order, bowed one last time, and left. </p><p>Leaving me with my loot and my thoughts. </p>",

    "content": "<p>It was still night when we arrived at the land, so running had been easy. Moonlight was bright, but no matter how bright it was, it wasn’t enough to make me worry as I ran through the forest with the elegance of a tiger, passing like a whisper. The only thing that slowed me down was the occasional sources of water, and even then, it was because I deliberately stepped onto them, usually moving upstream in an effort to further obfuscate our tracks from hunting dogs. </p><p>Though, I also spent some time leaving false tracks leading toward Central Gaul, which was the more reasonable path. Hopefully, it would misdirect them. Unfortunately, after the battle, we had no hope of concealing our landing spot, or it would have been impossible to track us. </p><p>Those damned, busybody pirates. Why couldn’t just accept their defeat and get away? Their overconfidence ended them, but in the process, also ruined our escape… </p><p>Once those false tracks were laid, I continued to run, continuing to run. When the dawn arrived, I had another choice to make. Continue to run, and risk being seen, or stay and rest…</p><p>I thought about waking Lillian up, but she had been treating my arms as a very comfortable bed. No, letting her sleep was a better idea. While she was a skilled woman and a competent mage, counter-tracking was clearly not a part of her skill set. </p><p>Though, I was surprised that I even had an option. I had spent a couple hours desperately rowing, and the rest running faster than a horse. I should be a trembling and gasping wreck, maybe even dead from exhaustion like an overworked horse. Yet, my body was still throbbing with energy, like I hadn’t been dashing desperately for hours while carrying someone and just had a comfortable walk. </p><p>“Another beneficial effect of the failed breakthrough,” I muttered, but I couldn’t help but feel dread. Such an absurd event couldn’t have been purely beneficial, and the more advantages I noticed, the more I was afraid of the cost. </p><p>A cost that I had no idea how and when it would arrive, because what had happened was supposed to be impossible. </p><p>It was that fear, more than the strategic concerns, that helped me to make a decision. The more I pushed, the more I risked myself. Instead, I wanted to camp, eat something, and maybe meditate a little to understand what had been going on with my body. </p><p>That didn’t mean there were no strategic benefits to my move. As much as I was confident in my senses, trying to avoid every wandering eye was much harder during the day than the night. At night, as long as I stuck to shadowy areas and avoided open plains, I would be another nocturnal beast running around. A glimpse soon to be forgotten. </p><p>Also, I could spend some time hunting, and using hide to make clothes. Nothing that would be useful for a long time, as without tanning the hides, which required time and equipment — both lacking — but even that would be less suspicious than the way we were dressed. I still didn’t have a shirt, and Lillian still wore my shirt and the tattered remains of her silk dress. </p><p>Even if they were made terribly, fur clothes would blend much better. </p><p>I didn’t stop the moment I took that decision. Instead, I started moving around, trying to find a good hiding spot, which wasn’t as easy to do. Unlike Britannia — and certainly unlike that uninhabited island — beasts were not much of a problem in Western Gaul. The sparse woodland we were currently in was the closest thing to a wilderness, but even here, all I could sense around were first-order beasts. </p><p>The real problem was the hunters that would inevitably visit the area during the day. I didn’t want to be seen by them, because once I did, sooner or later, they would babble about the unknown travelers, which would be discovered by the others. Even as I decided to be merciless and dealt with them, their absence would be noted. </p><p>The current area wasn’t dangerous enough that the mysterious death of a hunter would be written off.</p><p>I had to examine the old tracks for a while to get a sense of their movement pattern, and put Lillian inside. Just to be on the safe side, I lifted a rock and put it to the entrance to prevent any beast from stumbling in. </p><p>Not a very likely danger. This close to civilization, even the first-order beasts would have learned to stay away from people. Still, no harm in being safe. </p><p>Only after I had stopped, did I realize just how hungry I was. I felt ravenous, like I hadn’t eaten for a week. It wasn’t the first time I had felt such hunger, but the weird part was I didn’t feel as exhausted as I was supposed to. </p><p>Still, the sensation alone was enough to change my plans. Initially, I had been planning to just gather some berries and roots, enough to sate our hunger, but my hunger didn’t feel like it could be stemmed by just that. </p><p>“It’s hunting time,” I muttered as I moved deeper into the forest, preparing for the thrill of a hunt. </p><p>I had always enjoyed hunting. Only in the wilderness, I could push the full extent of my abilities without the fear of alerting my uncle about my development. It felt good to test my limits away from civilization, where even the slightest mistake could cost me my life… Danger had a way of making me feel alive. </p><p>However, as I tracked the boar tracks, I met with an unexpected drawback. Hunting was not fun anymore, not with my enhanced senses giving me the location of every single beast around me. I felt absolutely safe. </p><p>And, it was different than my previous apprentice mage state. Yes, even back then, I could use my mana to activate my elemental cores in various states, allowing me to enhance my senses. However, at that time, every activation meant wasting a precious resource, and making a difficult decision to balance the risk and the cost. </p><p>Now, it felt like the few times I accompanied — well, forced to accompany — my uncle to one of his so-called hunting trips, where he and his friends had a dozen guards to keep them safe, and half a dozen scouts to discover where the beasts were. </p><p>“I need to find better things to complain about,” I muttered as I moved toward the wild boar I had discovered. It was a first-order beast, with a strong presence on Earth. It was supposed to be a deadly battle, one that would push me to the limit since I was armed only with a stone knife, but it lasted only a second. </p><p>I carried it back, strangely disappointed… Well, at least until I felt an intense flare of mana at a great distance, far farther than I should be able to feel, water against air and fire. The pirates had been just caught. Just what they deserved. </p><p>Too bad that indirect revenge came with a cost. The organization was too professional not to capture most of the pirates for interrogation, which would reveal some of our secrets. Though, my best hope was that they would assume I was just an Earth-natured apprentice mage who had got lucky against their captain than anything else. </p><p>The less they knew, the more advantages we had. </p><p>The reminder that I was being hunted by a mysterious professional organization led by a sorcerer, with enough political influence that even provincial governors were willing to do them favors, went a long way to blunt my disappointment about my hunting expedition. </p><p>It wasn’t like I had to work had to find excitement in my life. </p><p>I returned to the cave with the boar. I first removed the rock from the cave door, then I shattered another stone to make another primitive knife, and started processing the boar. “At least processing goes faster,” I muttered as I rapidly skinned the boar and dealt with the other critical mess. What was supposed to be heavy labor that was supposed to take most of the day was handled in less than ten minutes, my superior strength proving useful here as well. </p><p>While processing the boar, I also set a fire pit. Technically, it was a risk, as someone could see the smoke and decide to drift closer, but as long as I didn’t create too big of a fire, it should go unnoticed, especially since I had stayed as far as from hunter’s paths. </p><p>It would mean I had to cook in rounds, but that was acceptable. It wasn’t like we had anywhere to be. I didn’t wake up Lillian for the first set, or the second … or the fifth, which I devoured like a pack of starving wolves. </p><p>Each set weighed around five pounds, which I ate rarer than I usually preferred, driven by my hunger. Twenty-five pounds of meat later, I was still hungry, yet I could eat, as it turned out to be my digestion was working faster as well. </p><p>As for meditating, I didn’t dare to start before Lillian could wake up. I didn’t know if she could help in any way, but nonetheless, it was better than nothing. </p><p>Between rounds of cooking, I tried to process the hide of the boar into a useful state. It wouldn’t be enough to make clothes for both of us, but it would give material to patch them at least. </p><p>Before I could finish, I heard Lillian finally stirring from her sleep. </p>",

    "content": "<p>When I arrived at the shore, Lillian was already a hundred feet away from the shore, behind a large rock, breathing hard as she battled exhaustion. Trying to push the boat to the shore faster than the pirate ship while trying to defend herself against the constant ranged attack of two mages and a dozen ballistas was challenging. </p><p>I hadn’t seen her, as I was busy dealing with the captain for a few seconds, but from her exhausted state, I surmise that she tried to block all of them rather than only the ones with the risk of actual collusion. A mistake, but an inevitable one. </p><p>Even as I approached her, I shivered, not because of the close call we had, but wondering what my grandfather would have done during the aftermath. Though, I didn’t have wonder for long. My memories had the answer. </p><p>It wouldn’t be fun. I decided to choose the other way. </p><p>“Congratulations, beautiful. We survived,” I said as I lifted Lillian in a bridal hold. </p><p>Her arms wrapped around my neck readily. A bit too tight in her desperation, enough to cut my breath if it wasn’t for my incredible physical improvements. “W-what do you mean. We still have a pirate ship to deal with. And, the captain —” </p><p>I interrupted her even as I started jogging deeper into the land. While the rest of the pirates didn’t have the ability to catch up with us without the captain, and likely had no will to chase us either, they were not our only enemies. </p><p>“Don’t worry. The captain is dead.” </p><p>Her eyes widened. “How —” she started, then froze, and a growl escaped. “He was underwater, right? And you didn’t warn me!” </p><p>“There was no time,” I said. “He thought himself invisible, which gave me one chance to deal with him easily. Would you like to have full information, and duel with him while he was trying to kill us rather than just ambush us to capture you?” </p><p>“Is this another Scipio strategy thing?” she asked. </p><p>“More or less,” I answered. “Now, hold tight. We’re going to run for a long time to make sure we won’t have any bothersome chase.” </p><p>“Pirates?” she asked. </p><p>“No. They lack the means to follow us. And, more importantly, with the captain dead, I doubt they would even bother trying to follow us. No, they have more important things to worry about. Like running away from their trade partners.” </p><p>Their mention had made Lillian tense. “Do you think they felt the battle? But it was more than ten miles away?” </p><p>“They might have not felt it, but even if it’s the case, they are too connected not to receive the news of what had just happened. And, meanwhile, local towns would send some forces to check. We should get away before they gather.” </p><p>Lillian took a deep breath as I ran faster and faster, ignoring my exhaustion even as I easily passed the speed of a horse. Running was far easier than rowing an oversized boat. </p><p>“Do you think they can find us still?” Lillian asked. </p><p>I would have liked to say no, but the ease they had been able to trigger an island-wide manhunt for me was still clear. “Depends,” I said. </p><p>“Depends on what?” </p><p>“It’s about their connections,” I said. “They clearly held a lot of influence over the regional governor of Britannia, but we don’t know if it’s about some kind of personal relationship between the governor and the sorcerer that they had been leading, or they have a similar connection on other provinces.” </p><p>“Surely not,” Lillian answered, though her voice fading with exhaustion. “Britannia is one thing. It’s more than a peripheral province. Western Gaul is an important province. Only the strongest politicians are assigned to the post. Even a sorcerer couldn’t act willfully.” </p><p>“True,” I said. There was nothing wrong with what she had said. Just the number of legions assigned to each province was enough to show the difference in importance. Britannia had only one legion; one that wasn’t even at full strength, barely above three thousand rather than forty-five hundred that it was supposed to reach, and undertrained — another topic my late grandfather had liked to ramble about. </p><p>Meanwhile, Western Gaul had five, while, Gaul as a whole had eight permanent legions assigned, and these legions were experienced due to constant border skirmishes at Germania, able to hold back the raids of the dangerous hordes of tribal beast tamers and shapeshifters. </p><p>However, more than their experience, the governor of Gaul was treated as the most important governorship since its inception. After all, the man who had first invaded Gaul had promptly used its strategic location to take over Rome, triggering the great civil war that lasted two generations and had been finally won by Brutus the Great and Cassius the Brave. </p><p>A war that had ended up in an unprecedented move. Total destruction of a founding Patrician House. </p><p>House Julia was no more… </p><p>Of course, that was not the end of the tumultuous history of the region. There had been different attempts to rule the region, from splitting into smaller regions to letting only the most loyal and the strongest regions take over the whole region. After a whole number of betrayals, rebellions, and political jockeying, the balance had been reached. </p><p>Western Gaul, the part that was fastest away from Rome, had been assigned five legions, the central Gaul had been assigned two, while the Eastern Gaul only assigned one. That way, Eastern Gaul, despite its financial potential, turned into more of a gatekeeper. Not strong enough to march on Rome, but just strong enough to slow down any political attempt. </p><p>Meanwhile, Western Gaul turned into a military center, ready to defend the border or intervene in other regions as needed. </p><p>It was a fascinating history, but it wasn’t good news for me. It told me that, if my secret was revealed, I would have the largest, most experienced, and dedicated army of Rome, consisting of five legendary legions, chasing me. </p><p>Not for a second, I believed my secret would trigger anything lesser if revealed. Luckily, for the moment, no one had seen anything. Both for the pirates, and for the mysterious other organization, our escape was about a lapse of judgment and Lillian’s unexpected skills. </p><p>I was thinking about those facts, because I needed to decide where to go. Trying to return to Britannia was out of the question. The sea voyage had been dangerous enough, and I was reluctant to repeat it. Trying to stay in Western Gaul was similarly out of the question. I could still control the bubbling mana inside of me, and Lillian could always help me to drain it. </p><p>But, the risk of an accident was too high. Sooner or later, a burst of mana would escape, drawing beasts and mages alike. When that happened, I didn’t want to be at the epicenter of five of the most experienced legions, each led by an experienced Legate who was likely an experienced sorcerer as well. </p><p>Not an odd I would like to take. </p><p>“Where are we going?” Lillian asked a while later, distracting me from my musings. “Returning to Britannia…” she started, but I chuckled, showing that it was out of the question. She just nodded, showing that we were on the same track. “We can’t stay in Western Gaul either. How about Central Gaul?” </p><p>“No, that’s a bad idea. For both of us. It makes it easier for them to search you if they are as determined as we fear, and for me, it means there’s no escape path if I slip up and let out another burst of mana. Not to mention, I can’t experiment anywhere near the cities.” </p><p>“What then. Are we going to try cut South until we can go to Hispania, or maybe Africa…” she started, then noticed my expression. Her eyes widened, and her expression turned lively despite her expression. “Not Germania! You can’t be serious!” she gasped. “They are nothing but a bunch of violent blood-thirsty tribes with barbaric magic.” </p><p>“Really, Miss Druid. You’re saying that,” I said. </p><p>She blushed, but continued. “Hey, the highland warriors are true and noble warriors. Not like those barbarians. You can’t trust Germanic tribes.” </p><p>I chuckled. “Of course, I’m not going to trust them,” I answered. “We’re just going to the border, and not the Germania itself. Even I’m not crazy enough to try crossing the Rhine River. Any location that could actually dissuade the Roman Republic from invading them is not one I want to poke.”</p><p>“What, then?” she asked. </p><p>“It doesn’t matter how much political influence our opponent has. The border is always a hotbed, and even a sorcerer couldn’t move around safely. Add in my enhanced senses that would allow us to move in the wilderness safely…” I said, then under her gaze, I amended it. “Well, relatively speaking,” I corrected. </p><p>She sighed as she closed her eyes. “Whatever you choose, I trust you,” she whispered, and tightened her arms. </p><p>I ran, trying to ignore the warmth that was spreading inside me. Surprisingly, it was harder to tame than anger…</p>",

    "content": "<p>“When I give you the signal, start pushing the boat with your water, at full speed,” I ordered as I took a deep breath. </p><p>Using Lillian’s water magic constantly hadn’t been a viable strategy when we were in the middle of the sea. While it would allow us to move faster than the pirate ship, Lillian’s endurance had limits. If the captain decided to give chase the same way, he would have caught up, triggering a battle. </p><p>A battle that would have inevitably alerted the ships moored at the island, meaning even a victory would have been troubling. </p><p>It was different when we were near the shore. For the captain, reacting to our sudden change of pace would cost him some time, making catching up with us very difficult, if not impossible. </p><p>And, I much rather fight with him on land. </p><p>“Now,” I said as I pulled the oars even harder, one last desperate sprint. Lillian cast a spell with her full might, and a stream appeared under our boat, multiplying our speed. </p><p>The mist around the ship faded in an instant, and the pirate ship showed itself in its full glory under the moonlight, its bright black paint glistening. I had found their choice of color silly when I first saw it, but, watching as it appeared from an illusion effect, I changed my mind. </p><p>It was imposing and scary, and that was with me being aware of their presence. I could only imagine the reaction of the town militia if such a ship appeared at their port entrance without warning… </p><p>However, the surprise strategic depth of their paint scheme didn’t last long, and more important things took focus. Important things, such as a dozen ballistas firing toward us. </p><p>Another benefit of my transformation. I could read the path of a dozen ballista bolts at the same time, and conclude that they would miss. Something I wouldn’t have been able to do even with a four-element state active. </p><p>“They are going to miss us. Don’t worry and just keep using your magic to push us,” I said as I continued to row. </p><p>“What are —” she started, only to cry in panic as the ballista bolts rained around us. Her control over her magic weakened, and our boat slowed down. </p><p>“Faster!” I ordered. “I’ll use the oars to avoid them if necessary. Don’t worry!” </p><p>Someone else might have trouble believing if I promised them I could avoid a dozen ballistas, but Lillian saw me do too many impossible things to start doubting me right now. Her magic regained its might, and we picked up speed. </p><p>The second salvo came soon after. Another dozen bolts, but this time, it was accompanied by several bolts of fire and air. </p><p>Luckily, while mages had the ability to attack to a great distance, manipulating mana that was not connected to their bodies was impossible. That range was different for each mage, but it was measured in feet, not miles. </p><p>Meaning, that while they might be more numerous than ballista bolts, reading their trajectory was not harder. The air blasts replicated the effect of the ballista bolts and rained around us, but the fire bolts were different. </p><p>Six of them would have landed on our boat if I hadn’t changed our route, and the rest still fell dangerously close, surrounding us with steam. Publius once again showed his angry disposition, most likely ignoring his orders to attack us directly. </p><p>Nothing extraordinary for a pathetic angry waste who killed his own men because he was in a bad mood. </p><p>Lillian gasped in fear again, but this time, she didn’t slow down, which was all I could ask for. It was hard to handle attacks of that nature, especially since her back was still turned toward the ship, and she wasn’t able to see the attacks until they landed. </p><p>I would have congratulated her, but I was dealing with a problem of my own. As I dodged the third wave of attacks, I could feel my anger flaring once more, in the same unfamiliar way that wanted to make my enemies pay. </p><p>Breathe in … Breathe out … It was hard to do as the battle raged on around me. It was easy to lean on my enhanced anger. It would help me to row even faster, and, if the need arose, be a better melee fighter. Anger allowed me to hit harder, move faster, and ignore pain; all invaluable during the melee. </p><p>Anger was a luxury I couldn’t afford. Not in this battle, even if it would have arrived without a sudden and inconvenient burst. Missing just one detail might cost me everything… </p><p>Instead, I continued reading and dodging the attacks with the most minimal movement pattern, while I also did my best to feel what was going on under the sea. </p><p>The captain was still nowhere to be seen, but they were doing their best to slow us down. Technically, the captain being exhausted to the point of collapse thanks to the illusory mist he had been maintaining for more than an hour was on the board, but I didn’t believe it. </p><p>Ironically, it was Publius’ actions, more than anything, that allowed me to guess exactly where the captain might have been. He was a bully, but also a shortsighted coward. He wouldn’t have dared to target us directly if the captain was still with them … or somewhere that he could see him directly. </p><p>Whether I would have realized it on time without his help was a different question. While the trick itself was obvious — a water mage moving underwater — in the heat of the battle, I had only a few seconds to process everything and react appropriately. Even with my enhanced senses, I could have easily missed it. </p><p>So, even as I tried to read the attacks of the pirates, I kept my attention firmly on the sea. Merely seconds later, I felt his presence. It was subtle, easily mistaken for a beast by anyone who wasn’t looking for him. I shivered. </p><p>What a close call. </p><p>The ambush was a devastating strategy, but only if we were unaware of it. Now that we were aware of it, it turned into a liability. Combined with my ability to detect underwater, one advantage he could never foresee, I had a unique opportunity to at least wound him. </p><p>“When I ask, be ready to cast one water bolt to where I point, then continue pushing the boat to the shore while shielding yourself, no matter what happens,” I ordered. Lillian nodded, tense as her spell pushing the boat weakened. A mistake that might alert the captain, but I lacked time to correct her. </p><p>“Now,” I said instead as I pointed to the captain, who was almost under our boat. Lillian attacked. It was a good, strong attack, but before it could reach halfway, the captain already took over her spell directly, turning it useless. </p><p>Didn’t matter. I used my full physical strength to throw the oars into the water, once again using them as giant harpoons, and jumped into the water. “To the shore!” I ordered her even as the water buried me. </p><p>I swam toward the captain. He was easy to find. The old man currently bleeding from a stomach wound, where a giant oar was buried deep, one of his arms hanging uselessly, likely from the blunt impact from another oar. </p><p>I was impressed. Despite being ambushed by a combined elemental and physical attack — one that moved with a shocking might and accuracy, enough to rival a ballista — he not only countered the water magic, but also he managed to dodge the first two attacks. </p><p>Even now, with an oar buried in his stomach, he was simultaneously using his magic to heal the wound, and gathering another attack. He was a true master. Strong and precise in magic, deadly in strategy, opportunistic and ruthless. </p><p>He was the kind of man that I could imagine hanging out with my grandfather. </p><p>Too bad for him that battle had no mercy. Decades of experience, and practice, and all ruined because of a subordinate’s mistake as he faced the unknown. I swam toward him rapidly. He converted his attack speed to a pure mana blast. </p><p>An excellent response to slow me down … if I had been using water in haste. Instead, his misjudgment allowed for me to close in the distance. I grabbed a hold of the oar that was still buried in him … and, one violent twist later, the battle had ended, leaving the captain with a shocked expression.</p><p>And, without his life. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Lillian, try to not make any sudden move, but we have guests,” I warned her, breaking her concentration. She opened her eyes, her expression tense. However, she didn’t make any sudden move, which was good. </p><p>“Who are they?” she said, tense. </p><p>“Don’t look back, don’t even move,” I warned as I carefully maintained the same pace. It was not my quickest burst, but any sudden change would alert them that their concealment was no longer effective, forcing them to take action.  </p><p>And, the last thing I wanted was to fight with an experienced water mage in the middle of the sea. Persistent bastard. I hadn’t expected them to stick around after being defeated. Neither did the mysterious snake-marked organization, based on the way they had been camping. </p><p>I didn’t know whether the pirates were still focused on the riches Lillian represented, or stuck around for revenge and wanted to use Lillian as bait, nor did I care much. Either way, they wanted Lillian. </p><p>I had no intention of letting them. I wasn’t my uncle. I didn’t betray people. </p><p>“Did they realize we had managed to get away,” Lillian asked. </p><p>“No, it’s the pirates,” I corrected her. “Apparently, they stuck around.” </p><p>“How did they miss a huge ship hanging around?” Lilian asked, shocked and exasperated. </p><p>“It looks like the captain has some tricks in his sleeve. There’s some kind of shimmering mist around the ship. Combined with the darkness, it connects the sea and the horizon seamlessly, keeping the ship concealed. I would  have missed if it wasn’t for my improved sight.” </p><p>Lillian shivered with my explanation. “The control and the power such a trick requires … can we win against them. Maybe I should surrender to them so you can get away —” she started, which I interrupted with a flick to her nose. </p><p>“No, cut it out,” I said, not sure what to feel about the speed she offered to sacrifice herself for my safety. The defeatist attitude annoyed me, but the importance she put into my well-being was the exact opposite. It warmed me in a way that I wasn’t used to. I ignored that warmth to focus on the present. “Who said we have to fight?” </p><p>“What do you mean?” </p><p>I smirked. “They are following us from a distance, waiting for us to embark the sea, because…”  </p><p>Her eyes widened. “Because they don’t want me to escape.” </p><p>“Exactly. As a water mage, you have too many options in the sea. I don’t think they’ll act until we’re on the shore.” </p><p>She frowned. “That doesn’t make sense. I know my limits. The captain is so far above me that it’s not even funny. Sea or not, he can take me down in seconds.”  </p><p>I chuckled. “Actually, it’s a bit funny,” I said, which earned an angry glare from her. I was quick to explain. “Think of it from their perspective. You have not only escaped from their custody while they had been fighting against the other organization, but also you have survived on a beast-filled island alone, triggered a beast stampede to exhaust them, and then stole a boat … all without exhausting yourself.” </p><p>That made her frown harder in confusion. “What do you mean? That’s nowhere close to what happened. </p><p>It fueled my amusement even harder. I didn’t bother keeping my laughter down — especially since it was a good way to convince any pirate that their presence was not noticed. </p><p>“How can you be this relaxed. We are about to get into another fight!” </p><p>“Oh, come on. Compared to the miracle we had pulled, it’s not even a threat. It even counts as relaxing.” That didn’t help her stormy expression. “Let me explain,” I said. “First, their understanding of the situation is limited to what they could see from a great distance. So, from their perspective, I’m one of the people from the organization that you threatened to help you escape. Ergo, they assume that I’m at most an apprentice mage, probably an earth one, strong enough to row the boat alone.” </p><p>“But you came from their ship.” </p><p>“True, but they don’t expect someone to be on their ship, because the captain only arrived in the middle of the voyage. No motivation for a spy, so they won’t even consider it.” </p><p>“Won’t they feel that you’re not using any elemental power?” she asked. “They probably have  at least one scout.” </p><p>“No, not with the mana-mist around them. A wide effect like that would interfere with their detection, especially from that  distance.” Then, I passed, thinking. “Still, you make a good point. Be ready to take over and use your water magic to drag us away if they decide that  they are close enough and  remove the mist.” </p><p>“Do you  think they will catch up?” </p><p>“Maybe,” I said.</p><p>“Really? Everything else, you have an answer, but a simple question like that, you’re unsure.” </p><p>I shrugged. “There’s nothing I can do about that. They are faster, and they have more mages among their numbers. They have the initiative when it comes to making a decision. The best we could do is to continue playing our role, and hope that they would wait until we are at the shore.” </p><p>Lillian nodded, falling silent. I continued rowing while keeping an eye on the boat. With our tactics,  rudimentary as it was, in place, there was nothing else to talk about. </p><p>Or, that was what I had thought until I started paying attention to Lillian once more. She was breathing faster and faster, showing signs of growing hysteria. I realized my mistake. I had neglected a very important mistake. </p><p>Waiting for a fight was a uniquely challenging affair. And, in our case, the situation was even worse. She was tense about a fight that might start any second now, and it was driving her to panic. I didn’t blame her. It was the reaction of anyone who hadn’t been conditioned like I had been. </p><p>Still, I needed to distract her. “Do you have any questions?” </p><p>“Nothing urgent,” she answered. </p><p>“We are not doing anything,” I said. “Feel free to ask about anything.” </p><p>She looked hesitant, still stressed by the upcoming fight, but she nonetheless spoke. “How can you predict the actions of the enemy so accurately, from so little knowledge?”</p><p>Normally, I would have answered it succinctly, but it would take a while for us to reach the shore. A lengthier explanation was exactly what I needed to distract her from the upcoming fight. “What do you know about the Scipio Family?” </p><p>“Well, nothing much, I suppose. I know that they were a very important part of the Republic’s ancient history, before the split even happened, responsible for some of the greatest victories.” </p><p>“Succinct, but correct. Two of our ancestors, in particular, had played a very important role when Carthage threatened to destroy Rome, which, at that time, was nothing more than a regional rival. Ironically, before those two, despite being a Patrician Family, we weren’t famous for our tactics. They had learned those tactics from the devastation of many Roman armies,  in the hands of  Hannibals, two famous generals. From there, our unique brand of strategy was born.” </p><p>“How so?” </p><p> “You might have realized that Roman society, in general, has a very overbearing attitude when it comes to warfare.” </p><p>“Yeah, our family has some interaction with the local legions. They are rather … direct.” </p><p>“That’s the traditional military ethos of Rome. Better training, iron discipline, and relentless frontal assaults of superior firepower, both mana and iron… It often works, because very rarely, Rome had to fight against a superior enemy.”  </p><p>“And, how does the Scipio approach differ?” she asked, invested in the explanation. </p><p>“We have three core tenets: information is power, deception is a valuable weapon, and play to the weakness of the enemy. My ability to read the enemy is based on the first tenet. My crazy old man had taught me how to predict people, both by reading their actions and body language, but also understanding what drives them. It took years, but it helps.” </p><p>“It feels…” </p><p>“Trivial and useless, right?” I said. “And what would you say if the final victory of the second Punic War, which came close to destroying Rome, actually relied on that principle to achieve what everyone thought be impossible by using that principle…” </p><p>“I would say that it’s nonsense,” she said in disbelief. I was happy with it. It was much better than panic. </p><p>“Let me tell you the tale of it, then…” I said, and started a grand tale of the Second Punic War, which was filled with some of the greatest Roman tragedies, like Trebia, Lake Trasimine, and the infamous battle of Cannae, followed by Hannibal’s dominion of the Italian peninsula, and the reversal forced by Scipio at the battle of Zama. Though, I did my best to keep the tales entertaining, rather than the dry military and political dissections my grandfather favored. </p><p>Those had been his favorite talking topics while training me. </p><p>The way I told the story would hardly teach anything to Lillian. But then, it wasn’t the aim. It was to keep her from panicking as we steadily moved toward the shore, followed by the pirates. As long as they maintained the distance, I was happy to ignore their presence…  </p><p>Then, just as we were merely a mile away from the shore, the pirate ship started to pick up speed.</p><p>I cut my thrilling tale of how an ancient Scipio had countered the legendary elephant-tamer mages of Carthage. “It’s time. We’re going in the act in five seconds.” </p><p>Just like that, the tension was back. However, this time,  it was a different kind of tension. Not a directionless panic, but a shared determination to end up victorious.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Once I heard about the declaration of war, I knew that Aisnam would have to go and deal with it despite it still being midnight. It was too important not to be dealt with, but I also understood why she wanted to engage with it disguised as a servant. </p><p>She wanted her enemies to believe that, Queen the Cultivator was too wounded to respond, and spend nights recovering. </p><p>Aisnam waited at the door for a moment, processing the information. “Tell the guards that Her Highness will see them tomorrow.” </p><p>“Madam. What if they —” the messenger started. </p><p>“Her Highness’ orders are adamant. She’s not to be disturbed while cultivating. No envoy can change it,” she declared. “I’ll come and oversee the preparations.” </p><p>“As you wish, Madam,” the messenger answered as she gave a bow and left. </p><p>Aisnam returned to my side. “Let me guess. You need to go deal with an emergency,” I said. </p><p>“I’m sorry. It’s nothing important. Just an emissary, but…” she said as if the news hadn’t been about a potential invasion to mix with the current situation. </p><p>“I understand. With everything, emergencies are important,” I said. She kissed me one last time before leaving. </p><p>I had to admit, I wasn’t particularly torn up about the sudden intervention, not when I wanted to finally test my newest improvement. So, the moment Aisnam had left, I activated the illusion that made it look like I was meditating, and walked into the secret tunnel. </p><p>As I walked, I threw a fleeting glance toward the Stone Door, wondering if the next level of Nabata formation skill would allow me to comprehend some of its secrets. </p><p>Not enough to repair it. As I improved, I was starting to realize that even a Foundation Establishment level technique couldn’t repair it under normal circumstances. At a minimum, a Golden Core level technique was required. </p><p>Meanwhile, the Nabata formation technique was merely for the Qi Gathering realm. </p><p>My talks with Aisnam gave me some idea about the differences between various cultivation realms. For example, I learned that Foundation Establishment and Golden Core cultivators used a different form of Qi, transformed from available Qi, which required a completely different set of techniques to utilize. As a result, they were far more devastating. </p><p>Apparently, they could still use the ordinary Qi, but under most circumstances, chose not to. </p><p>So, no matter how much I improved the Nabata formation technique, I didn’t expect the ability to repair the formation of the stone door. </p><p>Comprehension was a different issue. </p><p>Even when my formation skill at Major Immersion, I could feel the general function. It held back some kind of mysterious being inside, that much was obvious, but it was not a prison like I initially expected. No, it was more of a conduit. </p><p>It was channeling something in … but nothing was left. I also knew that whatever it was channeling was not Qi, or I would have been able to detect it. </p><p>“Maybe I’ll understand it better once I leave,” I muttered. I was still afraid of the being hidden inside, so I was yet to touch the technique in my mind, that they forcibly imparted. </p><p>I wouldn’t do so until I got a better idea about exactly what that Stone Door was. Even Aisnam didn’t know. </p><p>Oh, she thought that she did. She had told me the story of a demon, trapped here, in a Qi-poor zone because it couldn’t be killed, and she was telling the truth. Or, at least what she thought to be the truth, which was not exactly the case. </p><p>No, there was a different mystery behind that door, especially since, according to Aisnam, to her knowledge, some of the other kingdoms — but not all of them — had similar crypts. I was tempted to go and visit the others, to see the differences between different gates, but I decided against it. </p><p>I had too many troubles already, and couldn’t afford to find more. </p><p>I started running once again. I left the tunnel behind immediately, and, an hour later,, so was the Zaim Kingdom. However, continued running, until I left Xanhum Kingdom behind as well, and settled into the desolate area between the two kingdoms. </p><p>I was tempted to go to Linnass Kingdom for the experiment so that if I failed to contain it, it would fall to their head. But, after considering it for a while, I decided against it. If such a thing happened the same day as their declaration, some people might decide to check Zaim kingdom just in case. </p><p>And, I couldn’t afford such a development. </p><p>Once I reached my target location, I spent some time searching for a deep cave, and even more time setting several layers of formations to ensure protection. Just to be on the safe side, I even activated several purification and protection talismans.</p><p>Considering the talismans I had been using were Peak Yellow grade, just by activating them, I had wasted a treasure that could have probably purchased a mortal city, maybe even two. </p><p> Not that it mattered when I could write hundreds of them each day. Not to mention, I couldn’t sell them without getting myself killed. So, ultimately, it didn’t matter. </p><p>“Now, let’s see the commotion created by Minor Integration,” I muttered as I triggered the skill —</p><p>And, immediately thanked every divine being I could remember that I had gone through all those troubles isolating myself. I had been surrounded by a multicolored glow, one that almost felt like a bridge. I found myself immersed in an illusory river, if only for a moment. </p><p>No, it was not a river, but a road that I had been walking endlessly. </p><p>No, it was not a river, but a mountain I was climbing…</p><p>No, an endless waterfall…</p><p>No, an avalanche…</p><p>And, many more. It was the single weirdest experience I ever had. However, with that weird experience, came an intense understanding of formations, the kind that turned my earlier understanding into a joke. As I glanced at my previous work that surrounded me, all I could feel was disgust for shoddy work. </p><p>The jump was many times greater than between Perfection and Minor Immersion. Even the gap between Perfection and Major Immersion wasn’t this wide. </p><p>“I’m so glad I had taken extra precautions,” I said as I examined my formation, and realized that, the energy from the breakthrough had eroded them significantly. </p><p>Worse, some kind of presence stuck around. As if, what I had done had left a mark on the world itself. I had no idea whether it would fade in a few days, or stay longer. </p><p>“Luckily, it happened with formations,” I muttered even as I started reinforcing the protections around the cave so that they would stick around for years, something I could achieve with ease with my formation abilities increasing even more. </p><p>I was about to seal it completely, when an idea occurred. “What would happen if Aisnam could discover here,” I muttered. Of course, I first needed to see if the aura had indeed stuck around like I expected or dissipated. </p><p>Either way, it was something that I would only address when my current trick of remote teaching stopped working. Just because the letters didn’t prevent the System from working didn’t mean that the aura wouldn’t either. </p><p>No need to waste things. </p><p>Once I reinforced the protections of the cave, I returned to Zaim Kingdom. It was already noon when I had returned, but there was an impressive commotion. There was a show at the entrance of the city. Five men were in cages, each wearing the sigil of Linnass Kingdom. </p><p>Their mouths were tied to prevent them from speaking, and their bodies showed strong signs of beating … but, with my strong medical knowledge, I could see that they suffered no permanent injury. </p><p>I just needed to listen to the gossip to understand exactly what happened. Apparently, once Aisnam declared that they wouldn’t have any audience, the envoy started causing trouble, even going as far as attacking the palace guard who delivered the news, injuring him seriously. </p><p>In response, Aisnam, as the Queen, declared that, by attacking her soldiers, they violated her hospitality, which removed their diplomatic immunity. As a result, they were captured and imprisoned. </p><p>Not a difficult achievement, as the envoy was barely at Muscle Refinement, while his guards were at Skin Refinement. It felt like an intentional provocation. I wondered if the king of Linnass actually would have preferred them to be killed. </p><p>Either way, it was another problem I only needed to be aware of indirectly. I prepared to return to the Spring Palace, to see if could delve deeper into the mystery of the Stone Gate. But, halfway in, I felt a tickling sensation. </p><p>A cultivator just triggered my passive detection formation around the capital, approaching the city. </p><p>I could easily ignore the threat of mortal armies.</p><p>Cultivators, less so. </p><p>I started moving in that direction. </p>",

What happened?” I asked as I caressed her messy hair gently, but didn’t prompt her to answer immediately as she closed her eyes, breathing softly. Being ignored might have been annoying for someone else, but I was used to Aisnam using me to release her stress after a particularly difficult day at the royal court. </p><p>Two weeks after her ascension to the Queen Regent, it was a routine. </p><p>Not that I was complaining. Spending my nights with a beautiful Queen desperate to deal with the stress of the day was hardly a chore. It was incredibly fun… </p><p>My cultivation improved despite staying in the same stage. Thanks to my gate transformation technique finally reaching Major Immersion, I was able to reinforce my gates to an absurd degree, to the point of easily matching the pure output of a Fifth Stage cultivator while still in my Third Stage. This meant, with my other advantages, I could probably take down a Peak Qi cultivator in a direct confrontation. </p><p>And, direct confrontation was not my biggest advantage. No, it was my indirect abilities. My talismans…</p><p>More importantly, my formations. It was hard to assess without fighting, but with proper preparation, I was confident that I could deal with a weaker Foundation Establishment cultivator. </p><p>It was thanks to my ploy of remote education, working as I intended. The System continued to trigger despite the fact that I was the source of her information, which allowed me to improve more … and, in turn, I was able to compile even better lessons for her. </p><p>It was a surprising positive feedback loop that reminded me of a video game glitch, the kind that allowed people to level up far faster than the game should allow. </p><p>Once that worked, I was even more convinced of my conclusion that, the irate mysterious being responsible for my appearance didn’t think to properly restrict my System … like it should have been in the first place. </p><p>I still remember her calling me a Potential, which implied that there were others with the System. This also implied that, eventually, someone might notice my exploits and close it … maybe even ‘ban’ me completely. </p><p>Unfortunately, even realizing that, I wouldn’t stop using the System. I have no Immortal Root and no cultivation talent. I didn’t have the luxury of turning my back to my only advantage. That was why I ignored those risks and focused on my skills. </p><p>Particularly, formations, which, thanks to my positive feedback loop, had not only caught up with my other skills, but actually reached to next stage. </p><p>Minor Integration. </p><p>Naturally, I didn’t trigger it. I wasn’t planning to trigger it until I found a nice underground cave a few countries over and covered it with formations. I had no idea what kind of effect it would create, but I wasn’t stupid enough to test it in the capital, where people were already keeping an eye on it. </p><p>Speaking of the capital where everyone keeping an eye on, I stopped thinking about the passage of time, and focused on Aisnam, who seemed to be ignoring my question. It must be particularly bad.</p><p>It was telling. Two weeks had passed since her ascension to the throne — even though, ostensibly, it was only temporary — and no day of her passed without an issue. Every day, there was news of cities rebelling, riots in the capital, and deliveries of food being delayed. </p><p>Ruling a country that was being invaded was not fun. </p><p>Of course, technically, there was no invasion. Publicly, one of the city lords, who had been also the cousin of the late king, had declared that the Queen was responsible for massacring them. He had no proof, but he had the Tiger Fist army supporting him, which was far more convincing as far as other nobles were concerned. </p><p>He was a convenient puppet. </p><p>Under his banner of rebellion, almost half of the country was taken by the Tiger Fist army already. That speed was supposed to be impossible. With the distance between the cities far wider than I was used to, the invasion of multiple cities required several months. </p><p>However, most of the cities just surrendered under the guise of joining the rebellion, even going as far as sending their own battalions to join the Tiger Fist army, thinking that they had already read the situation correctly. </p><p>They couldn’t be more wrong, of course. Even alone, she was capable of decapitating the puppet rebel and the leaders of the Tiger Fist alone. Only two things kept her back. The first was the Pact, which prevented cultivators from attacking ordinary people. </p><p>Her role as the Queen Regent gave her some leeway, but only when defending the capital. </p><p>It was already a big problem, but not as big as the other one. She needed to keep her recovery a secret until she could reach the peak of the Ninth Stage to prevent her family from targeting her, which could still take months, particularly since her Immortal Root still seemed to have some problems. </p><p>The accident she had experienced before we met had a bigger impact than she had assumed. </p><p>“… Training the new guards is difficult,” she finally said, which was clearly not the real reason. </p><p>“I understand. Trying to teach a hundred new martial artists at the same time is no simple challenge,” I replied. </p><p>She was referring to a squad of martial artists that she was raising personally. A hundred young women, each recruited from the capital personally by Aisnam. Some of them were palace maids, and some of them were ordinary citizens from the capital. </p><p>However, the common line was that none of them had ever been trained as martial artists. Aisnam decided to use my indirect help to elevate them from nothing rather than improving the palace guard. </p><p>I had to admit, it was a good call, particularly since Tiger Fist army and the rest of the rebellion were happy to grow more and more forces rather than attacking directly. That way, not only she could ensure that the new recruits would be loyal to her and only her, but also she could hide their development. </p><p>A counter-attack from a hundred Connate Realm Martial artists would be devastating enough. </p><p>A complete ambush, on the other hand… it would be spectacular. </p><p>However, even after saying that, Aisnam looked stressed. I didn’t prompt her to share it, but I rubbed her shoulders gently, slowly letting her share her burdens. Effectively, I was interrogating her, through the long-honored spy tradition of honey trap. I might have been feeling guilty about it if it wasn’t for one very important detail. </p><p>I used those secrets to help her secretly. I was still unable to bring myself to kill someone, but a few of her most problematic opponents had experienced some troubles during their martial cultivation, forcing them to stay inside to recover from their injuries. Also, several times, some of her most trusted palace guards caught people smuggling all kinds of valuables including but not limited to gold, high-essence food, and low-grade apothecary pills, solving some of her biggest problems. </p><p>“… Three other cities rebelled today and joined the Tiger Fist army,” Aisnam muttered after a while. “It makes fourteen cities. More than two-thirds of the country now supports the rebels. I … Her Highness is troubled that things are collapsing faster. What if they attack us before the new Shadow Guard is ready? They are still at the Entry Stage of Skin Refinement.” </p><p>I sighed. “I wouldn’t worry about that much. You mentioned that you deliberately asked your allies to keep their breakthrough slow to make sure their foundations are strong. If it goes badly, you can always hasten those breakthroughs and focus on their foundation later,” I replied. </p><p>“Maybe —” Aisnam started, but then stopped speaking. A few seconds later, I understood what silenced her. A lone Martial Artist was running toward the Spring Palace at full speed. One at Connate Realm. “I can feel a messenger approaching. It must be important. Her Highness is in seclusion, so I must see to it,” she explained even as she left. </p><p>“I understand. Being the right hand of the Queen is no easy job,” I said, ignoring the temptation to give her a hard time about her double identity. It was not exactly a big problem. </p><p>Instead, I stayed in bed while Aisnam went to the door to talk with the messenger. </p><p>“Report,” she ordered after she raised a thin layer of Qi to block her voice. Unfortunately for her, with the formations in place, there could be no secrets from me in the Spring Palace. I wondered if the emergency was worth ruining our fun, or if it was just another city rebelling. </p><p>“E-emergency, milady,” the guard declared. “Linnass kingdom had just sent an emissary … they are saying that they have demands, and unless they are not met, they will declare war.” </p><p>Well, I had to admit. A declaration of war was a good reason to ruin our fun. </p>",

Things are dangerous. We don’t know if the Tiger Fist army could return. I don’t want you to get hurt. Understood,” she said, referring to our plan. On the surface, she would spend her days working for the Queen, and during the night, stay in the Spring Palace to make sure there was no accident at the stone gate. </p><p>In reality, she wanted to focus on being the Regent Queen during the day, and spend her nights relaxing with me. </p><p>I was in perfect alignment with that plan, as it allowed me to deal with various things during the day, and spend nights relaxing and studying. It was an excellent balance between seeking new opportunities and improving my already existing skills. </p><p>“Don’t forget, I remember,” I answered even as I hugged her one last time. “I want to spend my day meditating in the first place. I think I have some new insights into my Forest Dance. Just try not to enter when I keep the door locked.” </p><p>That mention had a point. I had already covered the Spring Palace with enough formations to turn it into my domain, so she wouldn’t notice my absence, and feel like I was inside. I had taken a page out of her book and put a puppet in the room. However, unlike her puppet, mine was supported by several illusions, making it indistinguishable from real me. </p><p>The formations were amazing, which made me even more enthusiastic about triggering the Minor Immersion level and improving it even further. It's too bad that it felt too far away. The system returns were highly linked to her initial skill level, so, even with the incredible return rate, I expected it to take a lot of time. </p><p>Aisnam left, but I lingered a while, and triggered my skill rewards, immersing myself as the foreign information settled on my mind easily. “Wondrous,” I muttered even as I looked around, taking note of my formation, noticing a couple mistakes I had noticed before. It might have stayed in Perfection, but every time I received a System lesson, my capabilities sharpened further. </p><p>I was tempted to overhaul the formation of the Spring Palace completely. But, it required at least a week, so other than spending a few minutes fixing some esoteric mistakes that might have triggered a catastrophic risk, I didn’t stay here, and left the capital through the tunnel. </p><p>Outside, things were calm … as calm as things could be. The capital had already lost some of its population earlier, and now, with the Tiger Fist army hovered threateningly — but not from close, they were camping twenty miles away — people were too tense to leave their homes. </p><p>The palace guards had taken over the others, and even Connate Realm martial artists were on the walls. A rare sight, as they were supposed to be protecting the Royal family, but understandable. After all, there was no more royal family to protect. Just one Queen that could defend herself better than any Connate Realm guard despite her — fake — injury. </p><p>After a brief observation, I decided to pick the meeting spot in the capital, formations allowing me to hide from Aisnam even if she started to get curious. There was a lot of real estate for sale. Disguised as a merchant who was afraid of leaving the city, I purchased a nice home with a large courtyard, as far away from the palace as possible. </p><p>While I was confident I could avoid Aisnam’s gaze, no need to make it any easier. </p><p>I used one formation stone to set up a weak isolation ward, with some illusions to make sure no mortal or martial artists could actually pass the walls without getting lost, unless they were carrying a stone with an appropriate signature. </p><p>Perfect formation skills were very convenient. </p><p>Then, I set up a nice message box, one that would send a message to both Markas and the Spring Palace whenever someone had dropped a message. </p><p>Essentially, a bulky pager. </p><p>Once that was complete, I had written a long, formal letter that had congratulated Aisnam for her success, and wished her even more. I attached an even longer price list, which included anything an apothecary could make, putting as small of a price as I could get away with without making her suspicious. </p><p>I even went as far as promising her that, and Bone Refinement Martial artist that she sent would leave as Connate Realm martial artist the next day, and any Skin Refinement artist would only require a week. </p><p>It was underselling my abilities by a significant margin, but I didn’t want to look too strong. </p><p>Just as I was about to leave, inspiration hit. What if I started teaching Aisnam about cultivation. What would happen then? </p><p>With Pearyin, it was a failure, because she started viewing me in a position that was superior, and it didn’t look like it would change. But, I taught her directly. </p><p>With Aisnam, I had a chance to do so indirectly. </p><p>Technically, it was risky, but I decided to take it nonetheless. After all, as far as the System benefits went, what Aisnam could provide to me was already limited. Some of my skills reached Minor Immersion, and some reached Major Immersion, but for all of them, the next stage was too far away. </p><p>With that in mind, I grabbed a few pieces of paper, and started writing a lesson about Nabata formation art, one that explained several tricky points in a way that would help a beginner immensely. I even went as far as imbuing with with some remnant Qi, making it so that the lesson was not just transferred by writing itself, but also the impressions of Qi. </p><p>With my calligraphy at Major Immersion, I was able to convey a lot through that writing, while also making it look like it was written by an old master a few decades ago, to answer his disciple’s questions. </p><p>And, if those questions were very similar to the points that Aisnam was currently struggling with … what a fortunate coincidence. </p><p>“I hope it doesn’t screw it up completely,” I said. From my previous experiences, I was reasonably confident that it wouldn’t, but there was still a certain risk. </p><p>Still, it was nothing compared to what other cultivators faced as they fought and struggled for even a scrap, so I didn’t feel like I had any right to complain. </p><p>With those preparations complete, I went out, observing the Tiger Fist army, and checking the numbers. I noticed that they were split into two, one large, and one small. The small one was the one that stayed near the capital, and I noticed that there weren’t many Connate Realm martial artists among them. </p><p>Just ten. </p><p>Well, it was still more than enough to invade multiple cities, but nowhere near enough to actually fight against even an injured cultivator like they believed Aisnam to be. However, it was still large enough that, they could probably fight against any force the capital could realistically send out, or at least retreat safely. </p><p>As long as Aisnam stayed inside. </p><p>It felt like a bait, but I didn’t bother with it. If it was bait, they weren’t prepared to catch a vicious shark. </p><p>“Still, let’s make sure things won’t be reversed,” I said as I established a couple formations outside the city, something I had been avoiding carefully before, afraid of being noticed, but, with my formations ability finally at Perfection, I was confident that they would stay hidden. </p><p>Especially since they were doing nothing but detecting Qi passively, radiating none of their own. Essentially, it was a silent web that would alert me if a cultivator stepped into a hundred miles radius of the capital unless that cultivator was trying to keep their presence hidden.</p><p>Unfortunately, that was a tradeoff I had to accept to keep the formation hidden. </p><p>I might have expanded it even further if I wasn’t running out of the formation stones to stabilize it. I still had some, but I wanted to establish the same thing around Markas, as well as Pearyin’s hiding spot. </p><p>“It’s good to have the confidence to defend myself,” I muttered even as I moved on to my next target. The larger portion of the Tiger Fist army, which, to my surprise, wasn’t actually moving toward Markas. Instead, they had split, and targeted the cities closest to the capital. </p><p>Curious, I disguised myself as one of them and mixed with the crowd. Hiding myself among a moving army wasn’t particularly challenging. They had several scouts that kept an eye outside, but once I bypassed them easily, it was easy to move around. </p><p>An army was a logistical nightmare, so no one paid attention to another disciple running around carrying a box away from restricted areas. As I moved around, I listened to the discussion of the commanders, whose discussions were not a secret from a cultivator. </p><p>Soon, I understood their reasoning. The reason they weren’t attacking Markas was easy. They couldn’t, not when the whole excuse of their existence. </p><p>I had already given Aisnam the tools to prevent it if she thought that to be important. She could recruit hundreds of Connate realm martial artists and crush the army if she thought the risk was acceptable. And if she thought that it was too suspicious, anything I could do would be even more suspicious. </p><p>Most importantly, there was no need for me to take action. Time worked to my benefit. </p>",

    "content": "<p>When I returned to the basement, Emily had put on a shirt, working on the devices, but she was distracted. </p><p>“What was that, I heard gunshots?” Emily asked when I arrived. </p><p>“It’s not a safe neighborhood,” I said. She was tense, but not tense enough to realize what had happened was so close. She must have misjudged the distance. </p><p>“So, there’s no risk to here. Good,” she said. </p><p>“Yeah, we’re mostly safe here. We’re defended by a super,” I said. </p><p>“Mostly,” she repeated, catching on my deliberate mention. </p><p>I threw her a deadpan gaze, implying that she was missing something obvious, making her blush. “Of course, there’s some danger. Why else do you think we’re trying to set all this security equipment. For fun?” She blushed, avoiding my gaze. </p><p>It was not the kindest way to tell her that, but it was a deliberate choice. Before, I had done my best to downplay the danger and let her focus on the benefits and the excitement. Now, it reversed. I was doing my best to highlight the obviousness of the danger, and showing that, by visiting, she already accepted a certain amount of risk. </p><p>She lacked the strength of personality to argue against it. </p><p>Not the nicest of the moves, but trusted tech support was critical for my security with the Syndicate slowly getting more adventurous. And, only by binding Emily closer to me, I could use her in more sensitive activities. Not just occasional public search, but actual hacking. </p><p>On that, I was particularly hopeful. She might lack the technical know-how to do that through traditional methods, but I was confident that, with my power, I would be able to guess at least some of the passwords, which, in turn, would allow her to bypass the security measures. </p><p>That would give us three advantages. Two of those three benefits were rather obvious. It would allow us to gather information far more easily, as most people were unaware of just how much of their lives they were putting on the web. Also, there was a lot of money that could be made by stealing other people’s digital accounts and emptying them … of course, within limits. Steal too much, and you might find a national hero removing the roof of your house. </p><p>Admittedly, I was less interested in getting rich, and more about the ability to pay people in a way that couldn’t be traced back to me. It would give me some really interesting options. </p><p>However, the real benefit of Emily — once she accepted the job that might be closer to the dark side than she might be currently willing to submerse — would be to create a digital footprint for my mysterious employer. </p><p>It was not an easy challenge. For once, we needed to create a believable back story that would convince the experts they would have looking for it. </p><p>Then, there was timing. </p><p>It would have been already a difficult but doable job to set such a fake villain boss before we started. Unfortunately, my start was nothing but a desperate bluff that was supposed to keep me safe for a day, which then continued escalating just because I had the misfortune to buy a bar next to the center of a grand conspiracy. </p><p>Making a convincing story would be much harder. Not only did I need to create a digital presence, but also I needed to do it in a way that was reasonable for them to miss it during their first check. </p><p>It was like trying to plant evidence while the police were already at the crime scene. Far more difficult than simply doing it before. </p><p>No, Emily’s assistance was vital enough that I was willing to pull some tricks. </p><p>While I had been considering those, she dipped her head, thinking about the nature of what she agreed. I let her process that while I acted like I was testing the cameras and the other devices she had rewrote and linked. </p><p>I hummed in appreciation as I tested several devices. Their performance shocked me. She might not have any formal coding experience, but that clearly didn’t hold her back. Her performance was even better than I expected. </p><p>I realized the other part of her power, one that allowed her to interface with the devices directly, was even more useful than I had expected. I had already assumed that it would give her a deep understanding of the device to bypass her limited understanding of coding, but her performance was even better. </p><p>Fascinating.</p><p>However, even as I tested the surprisingly incredible performance of my new set of cameras, I didn’t let it distract me from the really important part of my task. </p><p>Emily’s mood. </p><p>I waited until the realization of what she accepted slowly sank into her psyche while she worked with the cameras, chilling her enthusiasm completely. </p><p>But, I intervened before she started to panic. She had received the metaphorical stick. Now it was time for the carrot to make sure she was happy with it. </p><p>I had the perfect excuse to change the topic. I walked toward her, and hugged her from behind. “Excellent work. More than excellent, even. I’ll make sure to fight a bonus for you,” I muttered, like I wasn’t the one that would make that decision. </p><p>“A - a bonus,” she muttered. </p><p>“Yes. Maybe even a hazard payment,” I added. </p><p>Her eyes widened. “Hazard payment. Y-you told me that we were mostly safe!” </p><p>“No, the hazard payment is about your workplace harassment claim,” I said. Her face scrunched in surprise, which lasted only for a moment as I pulled her shirt to the side, sending her buttons flying as I revealed her tits. </p><p>“This claim,” I said as I let my hand dip to her crotch, her nether lips rapidly getting wet as her body reacted to my trick. </p><p>“Ahh. I see —” she started, which was all she was able to say before I captured her lips, silencing her with a passionate assault. It was important, for more than my pleasure. I needed to make her associate her first job with a villain positively. </p><p>And, what better way to do so than a toe-curling, mind-numbing fucking at the basement of a villain den. I stayed behind her, but a step was enough to bring her against the wall. I pinned her between the wall and my body, doing my best to exaggerate my already tall stature. </p><p>There was no harm in giving her a few subtle reminders of her subordinate situation in the process in a way she would enjoy immensely. She moaned as she responded to my kiss, her gaze quick to turn dreamy as the pleasure invaded her body once more. </p><p>However, there was something missing. </p><p>She liked to be treated aggressively … just not as much as she loved being recorded. Luckily, we had a solution for that. </p><p>We had a room full of cameras. “Actually, let’s test the cameras,” I said. </p><p>“I …” she whispered, lost in her daze to understand the implication. “We’re stopping?” she asked, confused and disappointed. </p><p>“Of course not,” I said as I set several cameras and other sensors across the room, and linked them to the computer. “We need to make sure everything works as intended. Particularly, I need to see if they could pick up movement and facial expressions.” </p><p>She must have been affected by the pleasure more than I expected, because she just looked disappointed until I linked everything to the computer, and put the real-time feed on the screen. I also send a link to Tara, allowing her to watch from her phone. </p><p>Emily just posed, showing off her beautiful body, wearing only a pair of drenched panties. </p><p>“A good way to test the cameras, right,” I muttered as I walked toward her, enjoying the way the way she covered her breasts with her arms. </p><p>Technically, it was possible that she covered herself because she didn’t want to be recorded. </p><p>Of course, that meant that not only she wasn’t aware that the way she positioned her arms was perfectly popping her breasts while covering very little, even missing one of her nipples but it was pure accident that she twisted her body slightly and took a step to the left to catch the light perfectly. </p><p>Even without using my power, her expression of scandalous shock was not genuine. It wasn’t even good acting. It would look awry even on a student movie, barely reaching the middling ranks of porn movies. </p><p>Considering what we were about to do, it was the appropriate level of acting required. </p><p>“Oh, no,” she gasped in a beautiful, throaty tone as I approached. </p><p>“I’m sorry, beautiful. We have to make sure the cameras work perfectly,” I muttered as I closed in.</p>",

    "content": "<p>“What’s going on?” Emily asked, curious, not showing any sign of panic. </p><p>Understandable, as she had no idea about the difference between the two warnings. I didn’t give any outward sign of my panic. I didn’t want to ruin everything after I led her here. “It’s a bar emergency. She probably broke another tap. I’ll go and handle it first. Meanwhile, why don’t you start working on setting the devices,” I said, giving her a deliberately middling excuse, which I could escalate if needed. </p><p>She pouted. “But, I thought you would watch —” she said, unhappy that all the build-up of her fun strip show had been ruined, but I pressed my finger against her lips. </p><p>“Good things come to those that wait,” I said, gave her a promising smirk, then turned and left. Not the best, or most amusing way to handle her, but certainly the fastest. And, considering we were facing an emergency, I didn’t have the luxury of taking the entertaining path. </p><p>Especially since, with her in the room, I didn’t even dare to check the security cameras. Her power could make that very inconvenient. I didn’t give any sign of alarm as I climbed the stairs leisurely, and only started running once I closed the basement door behind me. </p><p>Tara was at the bar, wearing her modified biker costume. She had her helmet on, but that didn’t hide her worries. I walked closer. “Sir. I know you told me not to disturb you unless it’s an emergency, but —” </p><p>“It’s an emergency,” I completed. “What’s going on?” I asked even as I leaned next to her to catch what was going on. </p><p>“There’s three groups gathering. They haven’t done anything suspicious yet, but they were waiting at the spots you asked me to pay attention to, so…” </p><p>“You did well,” I said even before I could check the scene. I remember explaining to her the general layout of the neighborhood as well as the spots she needed to pay attention, based on a lengthy analysis that I employed my power. </p><p>As a result, I had identified several suspicious spots, ones that looked normal at first glance, but had some small problems that made those areas inconvenient. Bad drift, smelly garbage, or many other small problems that would dissuade people from standing there unconsciously, whether they were walking around idly, or trying to sell drugs. </p><p>Yet, there were some advantages of those spots. They had many items thick enough to act as cover, anyone that gathered there would stay hidden if anyone tried to see them from the bar, yet they would have a direct route. </p><p>And, most importantly, if all those spots were occupied, it would create a convenient kill zone around the bar, one that would prevent anyone from retreating. </p><p>The camera showed that every single spot had been occupied by Slasher’s henchmen, each carrying weapons. Merely automatic weapons, but they lingered. </p><p>“You did very well. We’re about to be attacked,” I repeated as I patted Tara’s back. Amusingly, her predominant emotion at that moment wasn’t the fear about the upcoming assault, but the pure satisfaction after she received a compliment. </p><p>Her submissive role played a role in that … but then, I could also see that she didn’t take the attack too seriously. After all, none of the henchmen had anything bigger than a handgun with them. </p><p>Interesting outlay. After dealing with the guild attacker, they shouldn’t have been limiting themselves to handguns. I could count twenty henchmen preparing for an attack, but Slasher was nowhere to be seen. That attack didn’t make sense —</p><p>Unless, of course, they didn’t realize Tara was immune to gunfire. After all, they only saw her fighting against the Chrome Defender, and during that time, she worked very hard to dodge everything. That time, she was able to do so, because I was directing every attack. </p><p>Thinking about it, someone without a similar power to catch the delay might easily assume that Tara had an evasive power to support her Strength rather than high damage resistance. </p><p>Of course, what they had was just an assumption. There was a gap between high-tech laser cannons and ordinary handguns. Even without something like my power, or the high-tech analysis capabilities of the top national guilds, they wouldn’t miss such an obvious reason. </p><p>No, they were here as a test, which probably explained why the Slasher wasn’t with them. After their previous attack had been ruined due to a ‘freak accident’ that ended in the death of two villains and one hero who was under their employ secretly, they were more careful protecting the rest of their assets. </p><p>The attack was restricted to henchmen. A few of them were on the phone, asking for orders. </p><p>“Be ready for action,” I said to Tara, but I didn’t make any sudden move. I could have asked her to attack the gathering forces, and she could have dealt with them with ease, but it would be a waste. </p><p>After all, it was not just an opportunity for them to test Tara, but an opportunity for me to create some convenient misunderstandings. </p><p>For that, I needed to understand exactly how they wanted to watch Tara. First, I checked the cameras, trying to see if the henchmen had any cameras. My security system might not be the best, but my power allowed me to identify two henchmen with button cameras and earpieces. </p><p>However, I doubted that it was the only source of observation. For that, I walked toward the window, ready to hit down if I noticed a dangerous observer. At a distance, about two thousand miles away, I caught a glint. </p><p>I tensed even as I activated my power, trying to understand if it was a sniper. It was too far to see properly, but I caught a double glint, suggesting that it was just a binocular and not a rifle. Not too shocking, as using sniper rifles was the kind of escalation that people were unwilling to commit, once again relating to the warped honor code between supers. </p><p>Killing each other with their powers was alright, but ordinary people and military weapons were not. It was the kind of thing that triggered too much attention. The Syndicate would avoid it, as not only did they value that unofficial code of conduct too much to openly violate it — as they benefited from that a lot — but also they didn’t want something that would bring undue attention to the warehouse. </p><p>I couldn’t help but sigh as I processed the way the world had been changed during the last decade, where an ordinary sniper rifle earned more scrutiny than a nuclear-powered power armor with multiple laser weapons, wantonly destroying buildings. </p><p>Still, even though a sniper attack was unlikely, it was not impossible. As I returned, I made a mental note to replace the windows with bulletproof ones. The current attack would be a good excuse. </p><p>“You can handle a bunch of henchmen with guns without letting them tag you, right?” I asked.</p><p>“They can’t hurt me either way,” she reminded. </p><p>“That’s not my question,” I said with a sharp tone, and she ducked her head down. </p><p>“No, sir,” she whispered, quick to accept my admonishment. “I’m … I’m not sure I could avoid all of them.” </p><p>“And, what if I command you like we did against the power armor.” </p><p>“Then, I can,” she said. </p><p>“Excellent. Then, I have a challenge for you,” I said as went to the kitchen, and came out with a small plastic bag filled with ketchup. She looked surprised. “Put this under your shirt, and carefully follow my orders. I want you to let one of the attackers actually shoot you, directly to the bag, but only after you dealt with certain targets, and on a visible location. Do that, and I’ll let you pick a reasonable reward.” </p><p>“Yes, sir,” she whispered, but this time, her tone was much perkier. </p><p>“Good…” I said. Still, I didn’t ask her to move until the henchmen started to move. I didn’t want them to realize just how many cameras we had around the neighborhood. It was counter-intuitive, but it would play well to our confidence. </p><p>As if our bar had some better protections, so we didn’t need to protect the area obsessively. </p><p>Only after the first group moved toward the bar, I asked Tara to go out. What followed had been easy. The first group was bait, pulling back quickly. I made Tara follow them. She dealt with half of them before the rest could bring her into what they thought to be a kill zone. With my commands and her speed, she easily dodged most of the attacks, and dealt with more than half of the henchmen, leaving them disarmed and with many broken bones. </p><p>“It’s time, to move to the middle of the street, get shot, and shout in pain,” I asked. </p><p>She did so. Neither her shout of pain, nor the fake blood was particularly convincing, but hopefully, it would a distant observer with a binocular. Especially since Tara moved even faster while she dealt with the rest, gathered their guns, and came back to the bar. </p><p>“H-how was it, sir?” she said as she removed her helmet, anxious. </p><p>“You just earned yourself a reward. Now, go and shower while thinking about it,” I said. </p><p>This time, I didn’t feel like following her to the shower. </p><p>She hesitated. It was a subtle shift, but it told me that she had something to say. “What’s wrong?” I asked. </p><p>“I … I have an idea for the reward,” she whispered. Intrigued, I gestured for her to continue. “I … I … I want to watch you,” she said, her blush threatening her life far more than the earlier guns. </p><p>“Your wishes, my command, sweetie,” I said. “Just keep your phone turned on.” </p>",

    "content": "<p>I had decided not to ask her ‘help’ again until we could reach the shore, but it was hard not to change my mind as I watched Lillian dress. The desire was dancing in my chest, begging me for another release. </p><p>Her shy, inviting glances didn’t make the decision any easier. </p><p>I refused the call, not just because I wanted to pay attention to our surroundings, but because I wanted to control my surprisingly intense instincts. I wasn’t completely inexperienced when it came to matters of flesh, but no one had awakened the same intensity of feelings I had felt toward Lillian. </p><p>A part of it was her incredible beauty. On that, there was no doubt. Another, even bigger part of it was our shared challenge. I didn’t remember the last time I had to face a threat or an enemy without the suffocating weight of the solitude. </p><p>Yet, even with those factors, I could feel that there was a wild, animalistic edge to my lust, begging me to disregard anything else and focus on my pleasure. Not the way I usually acted or thought. </p><p>I decided not to indulge that part of my instincts. </p><p>The rationale was simple. The timing of my new instincts left little doubt about their source, and it was not the best idea to indulge them until I got a better understanding of what had been going on.</p><p>My mental pondering had been interrupted by a movement I felt under the boat. I once again reached the oar and stabbed the fish with it before letting it drift away. I continued to row. </p><p>“It’s dangerous,” Lillian said, once again fully dressed as she looked at me. “They are far away. Maybe I should start scaring the beasts away.” </p><p>“No need,” I answered. “The biggest advantage of the first and second-order fish is their sneak attacks. Since I could sense their presence, there’s no benefit of scaring them.” </p><p>“And, if we were unlucky enough to come across a third-order beast?” </p><p>“We’ll think if and when that happens. There weren’t many such beasts in the channel in the first place, and it won’t be too late to intimidate them even if we stumble upon one. You can focus on your meditation. You have just received a lot of mana. You better start converting it to vitae.” </p><p>She chuckled. “You’re right. I should focus on practicing. With the threat we are facing, every bit counts.”</p><p>She closed her eyes, meditating. I continued rowing, but at the same time, I focused on my magic, giving myself a chance to observe the changes. While her ‘assistance’ helped to relieve the pressure, my body was still filled with mana, more than even an ordinary mage should be able to handle without burning up.  </p><p>I focused on my heart, where it all began. The moment I focused inward, the crystal glowed brightly, right in the center of my heart, my blood spreading the mana across my body with every throb with no limit, once again proving that the reputation of dragon hearts as great treasures was not for nothing. </p><p>With nothing else to do, I started wondering about one thing. The name. </p><p>The origin of dragon hearts was shrouded, at least for someone like me. The rumors, like the fact that they came from actual dragons that had been slain by the gods, were common, but even after I had received one, I didn’t waste any time wondering about it. After all, anything mana-related had fancy names, often linked to pointless old stories. </p><p>At that time, I confidently declared that I didn’t care about anything but their ability to generate an infinite amount of mana, which would allow me to reach the rank of mage of four elements, maybe even achieve the impossible, and turn into a sorcerer of four elements. </p><p>What a horrible miscalculation. </p><p>Now that I had one lodged in my heart, I was starting to believe that the name might not be as much of a coincidence. But, only might, because I didn’t forget that, only after I had merged the four vitae right in my heart, the dragon heart reacted. </p><p>Maybe it was just a coincidence. </p><p>I hoped so. </p><p>There were many stories of dragons, and if there was one thing that was common about them, it was the death and destruction that was linked to them as they raged endlessly, even their names were rarely mentioned. I knew there had been stories of Jupiter fighting against one, and almost being defeated. The great beast Typhoon. </p><p>A story that had been told to me by my grandfather. </p><p>My grandfather, famously paid attention to nothing else but my training. </p><p>“Oh, please not,” I whispered before I remembered Lillian. Luckily, she was distracted by her meditation, and didn’t notice my silent crisis. I wasn’t ready to follow that track, not when it would have no benefit. </p><p>Instead, I focused on my magic again, feeling its flow. It radiated out of dragon heart, danced around my body, increased the intensity of mana in my body, filling me endlessly, like a water skin being filled endlessly, its seams about to burst…</p><p>Not a good image, I thought as I continued to watch the way mana moved in my body. I would have channeled it to my elemental damaged and shivered elemental cores, to see if I could repair them. Such damage should have been irreversible, but I doubted anyone bothered to repair them with near-infinite mana. </p><p>I would try. After all, it was the only way all that mana would be useful. Humans needed the elemental vitae as a channel, otherwise the mana couldn’t be manipulated. That was one of the fundamental rules of magic. Mana couldn’t be used directly. Like I was unable to absorb the mana, and needed vitae as a medium. </p><p>Even now, that didn’t change. </p><p>Still, watching my body being filled with mana was not good. It was uncharted territory, and I had no idea how to progress. I wanted to shout in frustration, but remembered one of my grandfather’s saying. </p><p>The weak cries and curses and the strong acts. </p><p>Smart words. Wise, even, though as usual, the situation when he uttered those words was hardly a casual situation. I still remembered it.  I had just defended a farm against a small pack of hungry wolves. An ordinary pack, led by a mere first-order wolf that was wounded. My grandfather forced me to fight them alone while he watched.  </p><p>I was eleven. </p><p>I had hated him then, when he stood over my bleeding body, yet delivered a lecture about my mistakes before helping me, ending it with that quote. Frankly, no matter how much I love him, I still hate him. </p><p>A complicated relationship to have with a dead man.  </p><p>Still, his lack of mercy didn’t make those words any less true. There was no point in me to lament about my misfortune. I had taken a risk, and it backfired, ruining my breakthrough, either temporarily or permanently. </p><p>At least I came out with a new set of abilities instead of ending up being burned inside out. </p><p>I opened my eyes again, and focused on watching the horizon, ignoring the temptation to start repairing my elemental cores. I had no doubt it would be a painful experience, enough to rival the worst training exercises my crazy old man had been able to come up with, but it wasn’t pain that kept me back. </p><p>No, it was the fear of creating a commotion. The shore wasn’t too far away. Just a few minutes, and we would be safe. Once I arrived on the mainland, with my new capabilities, I was confident I could get away from anyone trying to chase me. </p><p>”I couldn’t believe that we actually got away. Incredible,” I muttered, but even as I said those words, I felt an elemental stirring somewhere at our West, a stirring that gave me a very bad feeling. Water.  </p><p>Talk about tempting fate. </p><p>I thought about changing direction, but I decided against it. That flare was too subtle, too controlled to belong to a beast. Also, there were only two possibilities. Either they were slower than us, in which case I would arrive at the shore before them, or they were faster than us, and trying to maneuver was useless.</p><p>I chose to continue, acting like I hadn’t noticed anything, hoping that our followers would choose to stalk us rather than push themselves to the limit, unaware of the advantage I would have on the land. </p><p>Not to mention, I much rather be close to the shore once that inevitable fight happened. Lillian was a water mage, which gave her a significant advantage on the water, but that benefit was already neutralized by the fragility of our boat. </p><p>I continued rowing, searching the horizon, hoping that we weren’t being chased by what I had been fearing. </p><p>Then, at the horizon, I saw a subtle movement, behind a cloak of shimmering water, enough to keep any ship camouflaged from wandering eyes — as long as those eyes weren’t enhanced more than what was possible in a freak accident.  </p><p>Even if that ship was coated with a bright, shiny black paint… </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Oh, you want to help me,” I said even as I continued to row, my smile naughty. </p><p>She avoided my gaze shyly, but that didn’t stop her from removing her shirt, once again revealing her ragged dress underneath, which, even after I repaired it, covered nowhere near as it was supposed to be. Not that it mattered much, when she got rid of it as well, leaving only her transparent silk undershirt, the view beautiful. </p><p>She turned her back, but this time, it was nothing to do with shyness. She looked amazing as the soft moonlight glistened on her damp skin. </p><p>“Amazing,” I growled even as I watched her. “However, I can’t stop rowing, so you have to work hard.” </p><p>“What a chore,” she muttered, but the excitement in her voice didn’t match her words. Her fingers were trembling in excitement as they grabbed the straps of her undershirt. A flick, and it was down, once again bequeathing me with the sight of her naked beauty, her blonde mane messy as it danced with the wind. </p><p>Then, she went to her knees before she turned toward me and crawled toward my side. She looked incredible already, but the suggestive nature of her pose as she crawled toward me, especially since, even as she posed,  she was too shy to catch my gaze. </p><p>She grabbed my pants. I lifted my hips and let her pull it. “May I use a small water spell,” she asked. </p><p>“As long as you are careful,” I said. A thin line of water pulled out of the sea, and got rid of all the dirt and sweat. It was convenient, but I wasn’t able to spend a lot of time when Lillian covered the distance and captured my shaft between her tits. </p><p>“Beautiful,” I muttered as she started moving up and down, cursing the circumstances that prevented me from giving my undivided attention to the scene around us. Instead, I had to split my attention in three directions, watching the horizon, trying to feel the presence of any sea beast that might approach us, and enjoying the incredible view in front of me. </p><p>At the same time, I had to row rapidly, but that wasn’t that much of a problem. It was just a rhythmic physical movement, and it was even helpful. With my movement, all Lillian had to do was to keep her amazing breasts pressing together and match my hips to turn things into something incredibly fun. </p><p>Then, she took it a step forward. She pulled back slightly and gave a lick alongside my length, making me tremble in excitement. The sensation of mana, making me feel like a boiling pot, didn’t help it either. A growl escaped my mouth. </p><p>She giggled. “It’s a pity we have to hurry up,” she muttered seductively. “I would have to test slowly and see which tricks my servants had taught me are useful. </p><p>I disagreed. It was not a pity at all. I was not in a condition to survive an extended teasing session. So, I just growled threateningly, and she giggled again before she stood up, and sat on my lap. I happily buried my face between her breasts as she took me inside her. Her hands landed on my neck…</p><p>And, she rode. </p><p>“Incredible,” I muttered, my voice muffled, wishing my hands were free so that I could caress her wondrous body as she deserved it. Instead, I continued rowing even faster, imagining all the things I would do to her when we were at the shore. </p><p>“Not incredible enough if you’re not moaning,” she said as she grabbed my hair hard, and pulled me for a kiss. I wasn’t complaining. She continued rocking on my lap as our lips stayed connected, her movements somehow even hungrier than our first time… Excitement, joy, fear, elation… </p><p>With mana pressure building inside me, I lost my ability to resist, so when she tightened around me, I exploded, filling her with my seed and with mana. She kissed me desperately one last time before she pulled back. “Do you need any more help?” she asked. </p><p>I did not, but I was tempted to answer yes. “Once we reached the shore…” I answered instead. “We just need an hour to arrive, then you can help me for a few hours … or maybe, a few days. Just to be safe.” </p><p>Her blush was beautiful. “If … If I have to.” </p>",

    "content": "<p>“I can’t believe we got away—” she started, her face flushed, excited with her success as the adrenaline filled her body. </p><p>I pressed my finger against her lips, silencing her. </p><p>“Don’t tempt fate,” I warned her. “We’re not away yet. Get in the boat.” </p><p>She followed me as we waded through the sea. I arrived first, and pulled her into the boat. “Should I cast a spell?” she asked. </p><p>“No. We don’t want them to notice us,” I said even as grabbed a pair of oars, and started rowing, my enhanced strength proving beneficial. Paradoxically, the farther we were away from the ships, the easier for them to notice our magic, mostly because they wouldn’t have attributed the mistake to one of their members. </p><p>“Do you mind checking the boat and see if they left any supplies on?” I asked, despite knowing they did not. My perception was sharp enough to notice the boat was clean. There were no discarded rations or weapons that required any repair. </p><p>Just two pairs of oars, and nothing else.</p><p>I asked her to search, because I wanted to give her a tedious job that would allow her to process her most recent excitement without crashing. While Lillian was distracted by the search I rowed rapidly. Not directly to the South, which would have brought us to Gaul, but around the island, hugging the shore close enough to be dangerous. </p><p>It was not a particularly dark night, so if we just rowed away, our silhouette would have been caught. </p><p>On the other side, I had already explored the shore and saw there were no inconvenient sentries that would ruin our escape at the last minute. </p><p>It was a mistake. </p><p>However, it was an understandable one. The commotion I had created during my breakthrough had forced them into a battle with the beasts of the island, which exhausted their mages. Then, they were still assuming that Lillian was either dead, or trapped in the middle of the island, alone, with no way to escape. </p><p>And, even if we had a boat, if it wasn’t for my new strength, we couldn’t have gotten away without alerting them. We would row with our strength, which would mean we could barely travel at most two miles without using enough mana to alert them, which would mean we would still be visible to the sentries at the crow’s nest when dawn arrived. </p><p>From their perspective, there was no risk. The viability of my plan had relied on my strength, one that I could sustain far longer than any earth elemental boost could have allowed to. I doubted that even the legendary changers of the Germanic wilderness would be able to match me. </p><p>As I continued to row, I felt a movement near the boat. Undersea. “Don’t move, and don’t use any spells,”  I warned Lillian even as I grabbed one of the spare oars, which was almost as thick as my arm, and ten feet long. </p><p>Not the most balanced weapon, but all that mattered was the side of the oars was sharp enough that I could drive it through the first-order fish that decided our boat would have made a good meal. I left it drifting in the water. I didn’t like wasting food, but we couldn’t afford any other beasts that it might have attracted. </p><p>I continued rowing. It took a little more than twenty minutes for me to row halfway around the island, which was more than five miles. </p><p>I thought about continuing until we were safely on the other side of the island, but that was another risk. Once they realize the attack was a distraction, they might decide to send someone to contact the sentries. </p><p>I paused a moment as I looked at Lillian, who had been watching the other side tensely. “We’re about to move to the open seas,” I alerted her. “I want you to watch the horizon and alert me if you see anything suspicious. Otherwise, be ready enough to defend the boat, but don’t cast any spell unless I ask.”</p><p>I asked it of her to keep her from panicking rather than anything. Ultimately, when we were in the sea, we had no hope of noticing the other ships before they caught us. It was not something I could solve, no matter how sharp my new perception was. </p><p>Without the elevation of a crow’s nest, our enemies would see us easily.  </p><p>She paused. “I can use my magic to intimidate the beasts. The ships on the other side. They won’t notice us anymore.” </p><p>“No, let’s avoid if possible. I could feel the presence of the beasts under the sea as well. I’ll ask you to do so if it is necessary. And, we don’t know if they have any experts specializing in detecting mana. Let’s not risk it.” </p><p>Lillian looked at my sweaty appearance. “Are you sure you don’t want to rest for a while? This is not a boat that’s designed for only one person.” </p><p>I shook my head even as  I smiled. “Don’t worry, we can leave right now.” </p><p>“You don’t have to push yourself too much,” she said. “I think we can afford to wait for five minutes while you rest.”</p><p> “Don’t worry. It looks like my endurance had been improved just as much as my strength. It’s nothing more than a light exercise.” </p><p>I was exaggerating a bit. Even with my improvement, using just a pair of oars to push a boat several times the speed it was designed for was not a simple achievement. I was tired, but I rather be on the mainland than in the middle of the sea, helpless. </p><p>“Really,” she said she put her hand on my back, and I felt her healing touch. If someone else dared to touch me without my permission, I would have reacted badly, but Lillian earned that right. </p><p>In more ways than one. </p><p>She frowned. “You’re lying. You’re exhausted.” </p><p>“Don’t worry. It’s not the first time I pushed myself more, and I don’t usually have as good of a reason as three ships full of mysteriously competent soldiers targeting me. Just another hour, and we will be on the mainland. Once we arrived, there’s no chance they could catch up with us.” </p><p>“True,” she said as she wistfully looked toward North, where the island of Britannia lay. “I wonder if we’ll be able to return to Britannia.”  </p><p>I smirked. It was not a nice smile. “Oh, yes. Sooner or later, I’ll return, and have a nice talk with my uncle. He has some questions he needs to answer.” </p><p>“Yes, your uncle,” she growled. “I have a  few questions of my own for him.” </p><p>“I understand. Don’t worry. When I meet with him, I’ll learn why they had tried to kidnap you before … before I have a discussion with him about how to treat one’s  parents.” Too bad it would be the last discussion my uncle would ever have. </p><p>Then, I took a deep breath, and calmed myself down. Not because I was ashamed of my thoughts. I strongly suspected that my uncle either directly poisoned my grandfather, or allowed those mysterious men to poison him. There was only one punishment for that act… </p><p>No, I calmed down, because I could feel my heartbeat picking up. Not the first time, as my heartbeat was quite intense while I rowed around the island as well. Yet, something was different. </p><p>As I focused on my anger, the crystal buried in my heart responded by radiating more mana, immediately straining my ability to contain it further. While it was good to see there was a way to get more mana during an emergency, the last thing we needed right now was to create a pillar of mana. </p><p>Even discounting the ships, would agitate the sea beasts. And, I didn’t want to deal with a beast wave at the sea, particularly not when we were on a dinky little boat with no weapon. I managed to stop the crystal from radiating mana. </p><p>But, not before it filled my body with enough mana that I was barely able to contain it. </p><p>While I dealt with it, Lillian had been looking at the horizon. She started speaking before turning. “You just want to keep me busy, right. With your senses, I don’t need to —” she started, only to stop when she looked at me. “Something wrong?” Lilian asked. </p><p>“I’m just trying to suppress my mana,” I explained. “I don’t want to let it out and ruin everything we had handled.” </p><p>“Really, you’re already at your limit?” she asked. “Even after you let it out?” </p><p>“Yes. It reacted to my anger and radiated even more mana,” I explained. I thought about keeping it a secret, but then, I decided against it. What was a small secret among every secret we shared? I expected her to focus on the emotional response, which was why her blush caught me with surprise. </p><p>“Do you want me to help you handle it?” </p><p>I smiled, realizing exactly how she had been planning to help me. </p><p>I had to admit, such a distraction was risky while we were at the open sea, but nowhere as risky as trying to suppress the raw mana that was flooding my body. I couldn’t use it with my elemental cores ruined, but I couldn’t let it out without ruining our hard work of getting away. </p><p>“I would love to…” </p>",

    "content": "<p>“ … Now, we have the last stage of our plan,” I said as I returned to Lillian’s side. I had circled around the island for the last hour, and searched for any sentries they might have placed. Luckily, there was no sentry. They assumed that they were safe after driving the pirates away. </p><p>That, or they chose to keep their forces together, assuming Lillian had no chance of escaping even if she was alive. </p><p>Our destination was their sole camp, and if most of the mages were as exhausted as I assumed after spending hours fighting against the third-order beasts, I would cause a distraction that would make people at the camp use their magic. </p><p>Which, in turn, would allow Lillian to use the presence of the other spells to cast a water spell, and drag one of the boats that had been pulled to the beach with an errant wave. </p><p>Simple. </p><p>As simple as my plans to get away from Britannia or the pirate ship had been… Therefore, I was already running several other plans in my mind as I did my best to prepare some contingencies. The first one was finding Lillian the perfect place to cast a spell rather than dragging her with me. </p><p>“I think you should wait here,” I said as I pointed a rock at the shore that was large enough for her to hide. “Then, get into the sea once you feel the first spell being used. Then, use the wave to drag the boat away. But if—” </p><p>“Yes, Marcus, you have explained it five times already,” she whispered back, frustrated. “I know you’re used to working solo, but trust me.” </p><p>I sighed. She was right. I was nervous enough to lecture her, which was pointless. She had some serious deficiencies in her battle approach, but none of them could be fixed by a simple lecture. “Be careful,” I still said before I turned and went back to the forest, the darkness comforting. </p><p>With my new senses, traversing the forest was as easy during the night as it was during the day. So, as I crawled toward the camp, there was no errant broken branch that made a crunch sound, no accidental stumbling on a nocturnal beast on the prowl for prey. </p><p>Not that there had been many of those around in the first place. The camp had a huge bonfire, making the camp comfortable and driving away smaller beasts that might be encouraged by the larger beasts at the same time. While it created the risk of drawing the stronger beasts, the kidnappers clearly thought it to be an acceptable tradeoff. </p><p>The layout of the camp was simple. They had six sentries watching the forest, each in the field of view of at least two others as they created a large semi-circle, each about two hundred feet away from the bonfire. It was a simple yet effective layout, especially since none of the sentries had been drinking or dozing off, showing admirable discipline. </p><p>The first real problem was the two sentries that were standing next to the beached boats. One of them was an apprentice mage, who was watching the sea carefully. Not all beasts were smart enough to target the empty boats, but there were some that had learned that trick. It was a good way to hunt careless sailors, forcing them to swim back to their ships where they would be vulnerable in the water. </p><p>The other problem was the solo mage right next to the bonfire, eating and drinking, showing no signs of exhaustion. His attitude confirmed my decision not to attack the ships during the day, assuming that such a group wouldn’t have committed all their forces to the fight against the beasts — not when the pirates might have been lurking around for revenge. </p><p>I wished that I had more of my usual gear. I wasn’t a qualified apothecary, but caring for my grandfather for the last few years forced me to learn some specialized medicines. One of them had been a sleeping powder, one that worked on an old man with serious pain problems. It would have worked on a careless mage as well. </p><p>Unfortunately, when I boarded the pirate ship under the guise of a forced recruit, I didn’t dare to smuggle anything but the dragon heart and some money, afraid of triggering a search. </p><p>I sighed. There was no point wasting time on plans that I couldn’t complete. I needed a better distraction. I went deeper into the forest, searching for a fitting tool. “It’s ironic that I’m relying on you,” I muttered as I put my fingers on my heart, listening to my own heartbeat. </p><p>One that felt subtly different. Stronger, but more rigid. </p><p>Like I had a crystal lodged in the center of my heart… </p><p>Even though it scared me for the future, the present benefits were hard to argue. Thanks to my advanced senses, I moved around the forest almost at a running pace, far faster than I could have moved even under the sunlight before the accident. It felt good. </p><p>Too bad mere physical improvements weren’t enough to take a force of multiple mages. I had thought about drawing them into the forest, and dealing with them one by one … but they didn’t look stupid enough to follow me deeper into the forest while losing their comrades one by one. They would just go back to their ships, surround the island, and wait for their leader. </p><p>Their sorcerer leader. </p><p>Ten minutes later, I had found the perfect target. A second-order snake, giving me the impression that it was a beast of air, wrapping itself around a mana plant of the same quality, trying to defend it while it bore fruit. </p><p>I didn’t recognize the plant, but the snake seemed to be determined to keep an eye on it, making it a good target. Snakes, particularly the venomous kind, were vicious ambush predators, but they were also relatively stupid with one track of mind. Even as a second-order beast, they were easy to mislead. </p><p>The trick was to survive their vicious reaction. </p><p>Catching a small, ordinary rat was easy with my physical improvements. I kept it alive as I went near the snake, and threw it several feet away from it. The snake lacked the capacity to question the sudden appearance of easy prey. Instead, it darted toward it with a dangerous speed, and swallowed it. </p><p>Eating didn’t slow down a second-order snake like it would slow down an ordinary snake, but it still distracted it enough for me to dart forward and uproot the plant. From there, I ran, and the snake followed with a furious hiss. </p><p>As the wind caressed my face, I appreciated my new improvements even more. Not only I was far faster, enough to leave a second-order beast behind — albeit one that wasn’t known for their speed — but also I was able to run with a shocking agility, like a tiger cutting through the forest. </p><p>Fast, deadly. </p><p>Yet, utterly silent. </p><p>My own performance surprised me. When I tested my limits earlier — as much as I could without alerting the mages — I didn’t expect it to act this smoothly. Therefore, I modified some of my plans on the fly. </p><p>I approached the camp a bit more than I expected while I squeezed the plant, making its smell spread. </p><p>And, threw it next to the nearest sentry with a tall arc. It plopped the ground with a wet sound, several feet away from the sentry. He didn’t miss it. He tapped a small drum that was with him with a specific pattern before he started moving forward to check what it was. The other two sentries moved close to the space he had just vacated. </p><p>Another show of their impressive discipline. </p><p>Too bad that didn’t save him from the fury of the snake blinded by anger after losing its bounty. The snake was simple-minded enough to follow the trajectory of the plant, and saw a man poking the suspicious plant with a stick. </p><p>The cries of the sentry were pitiful, but they stopped in seconds. The venom of a second-order beast was far more effective than an ordinary snake, which was a mercy. I pulled back three hundred feet into the forest, watching as the two sentries went to help. </p><p>The second one had experienced a similar fate, but before the third one could do so, the mage finally reacted, flaring his mana as flames danced around him threateningly. The area turned bright, enough for me to see one of the boats being caught by an errant wave. </p><p>The sentry responsible for boats missed it until it was too late, their attention caught by the reaction of the fire mage, but I could see that he would eventually react to it. I decided to distract them further. </p><p>I grabbed a stone, weighed it, and threw it. It cut through the darkness with a sharp whistle, moving toward the fire mage only to meet with a blast of fire. The fire mage reacted on time, and the heat wave that accompanied the blast was enough to change the direction of the small rock. </p><p>“Attackers, to arms!” he shouted, which gave all sentries, including the two that were responsible for the boats, something to do. Their reaction was slower than what I would have expected from such an impressive group, showing that the last thing they expected was to be attacked. And, now, the fire mage was setting several fires at the edge of the forest, overcompensating for it, unaware that it was creating the perfect distraction for us. </p><p>I slinked away and went to our meeting spot, where Lillian was waiting for me, drenched with water that made her ragged clothing stick to her body dangerously, with a proud smile on her face. </p><p>Behind her, was a small boat, designed for nothing more than to move between the ship and the shore. </p><p>Our best hope of escaping. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Are you feeling comfortable?” I asked Emily as we walked through the mostly abandoned streets of the slums. </p><p>“Not particularly, no,” Emily answered with a frustrated growl as she tugged her large work jacket. “When you said a disguise, it wasn’t what I expected. This jacket is so uncomfortable.” </p><p>“As uncomfortable as the fake beard?” I asked, earning a poke to my side. </p><p>“I hate you,” she growled. “Couldn’t I disguised as anything but a homeless old man?” she asked. “Is this about how much I spent in that lingerie shop?” She was referring to the large number of boxes that we purchased, costing me another six grand. </p><p>“No, I was very happy about buying those. I couldn’t wait until the pictures of them,” I said. Another honest response. I was glad for her shopping spree for multiple reasons. The simplest benefit was that, I would be the one that would ultimately enjoy them, so they were hardly gifts in the first place. It gave me another chance to show my generosity and appreciation, which was helpful. </p><p>Giving her another taste of glamour and ease of spending on an even minor villain was another bonus that I appreciated. </p><p>“Then, why the disguise?” she said. </p><p>“Because I don’t one anyone to notice you,” I explained. “And, homeless people are practically invisible in the slums.” It was not the first time I explained it, but I was patient, even though I looked around to make sure our disguises worked as intended. </p><p>I hadn’t been disguised as homeless before, but I had more flexibility when it came to changing my looks. First of all, I was a man, and not a beautiful woman, which meant people paid less attention to me, particularly in the seedier areas. Then, I had the benefit of my power, allowing me to quickly adjust my body language if necessary, which meant I could get away with simpler disguises. Emily, on the other hand, was liable to panic the moment we faced an obstacle. </p><p>Hence, the disguise of an old crazy man with a long beard, which had the added benefit of being easy to apply. A large hat, baggy jeans, a tattered jacket, and a fake beard, which could be put on or removed in a few seconds. </p><p>Soon, we entered the abandoned building. She looked around curiously but didn’t feel alarmed, which showed the extent of her trust in me. “Did you bring the cameras here?” she asked. </p><p>“Not exactly,” I answered as I led her toward the corner, and pointed at the dark tunnel. </p><p>“Oh, a secret tunnel, how exciting,” she muttered as she jumped in. I chuckled as I followed her, amused by her attempts to sway her hips to look attractive. Even her incredible beauty was helpless in her disguise. “You’re sure that no one will be there in the basement, right? No cameras either.” </p><p>“Yes, I made sure before leaving. I won’t let them learn your identity,” I ensured. </p><p>“Good,” she said, her voice naughtier than I expected. The reason, I learned soon after. </p><p>First, she pulled the beard and the cap, and threw both to me. Then, the jacket and the camisole followed, and my gaze widened. She had been wearing a red bra that I picked for her. A shelf bra that left her tits bare while supporting them from underneath. </p><p>I could have controlled my reaction, but it would have been rude when she had gone that far to pull a surprise for me. I gasped loudly. </p><p>Emily didn’t turn to look at me, which meant I was deprived of the biggest benefit of her new outfit. Her shoulders shook with an amused laughter. </p><p>“That’s unfair,” I said with a pouty voice. She chuckled, then followed with her next move. She removed her jeans, which were baggy enough that she could have done so without getting rid of her boots. I grabbed the discarded jeans as well, and focused on the view. </p><p>A blonde girl wearing nothing but old boots along with a sexy set of underwear, complete with stockings and a garter belt. It would have been comical if it wasn’t so erotic, the contrast between her environment and her pristine beauty doing wonders. </p><p>I continued watching her hips dance while she kept looking forward, each second giving me a deeper appreciation of her beauty, until we reached the basement that was filled with boxes. </p><p>“Wow, that’s a lot of stuff,” she said as she looked while she kept her arms around her chest at the large pile of concealed security cameras, motion sensors, pressure plates, and a plethora of other stuff, all surrounding a large, state of the art computer that cost me fifty grand to purchase. </p><p>I had purchased such a strong computer not to run the security Systems — which could have been done cheaper — but to give Emily a better toy to play with. Our previous experiments had shown that her power worked better with one strong computer rather than a multitude of weaker ones.</p><p>Of course, I had also installed the best software that was publicly available to obfuscate our connection. A tool she could use to dig around secrets safely. </p><p>Not to all of them, of course, but far more than she had been previously capable of. </p><p>“I told you it’s going to be a lot of work,” I said as I walked toward her. </p><p>“Still, why did you bother purchasing that many devices of different brands and functions? Isn’t it easier to put one big order?” </p><p>“It’s complicated. But as I spread them around, it’s inevitable that some people will discover them. I don’t want them to realize they belong to me.” It was more complicated than that, but for now, that explanation was enough. </p><p>“I see,” she answered, and didn’t ask any follow-up questions. After all, she didn’t care about the strategic nuances of villainous espionage. Her attention was already on the boxes that she was examining, and trying to look sexy as she did so. </p><p>“Why don’t you be a dear and help me unbox them,” she said. </p><p>I smirked. “Of course not. You’re the worker. I’m the supervisor. I need to watch you to make sure you don’t smuggle anything to your clothes,” I teased her, like she had anywhere to stuff them in the first place. </p><p>“Oh, how oppressive. Should I alert the villain union,” she said, her tone suspiciously like a moan as she teased me. However, even as she said that, she looked up, toward upstairs, where a sudden crunching sound had reached. </p><p>“What was that?” she asked. </p><p>“Just a steel block shattering,” I said. </p><p>She might be naive, but she wasn’t stupid and understood where I had been driving at. “Is that …” she started, then whispered even more softly. “The bouncer.” </p><p>“Yes, she’s the bodyguard they had sent. She likes to spend time breaking things. But don’t worry, she won’t come here. She doesn’t like the basement too much.” </p><p>Of course, Tara had no such problems. She was making noise on my express orders, an indirect reminder to Emily that, while I was nice to her, not everyone in the organization would be if she decided to spill secrets. A threat that was delivered without awakening any animosity in her. </p><p>Not a bad process. </p><p>“I see,” she said, her tone soft and trembling. If it wasn’t for my power, I might have assumed that it was just fear in her tone, but I caught excitement as well. </p><p>Perfect. It showed that, my extended ploy had an extended benefit. The adventure in the cafe where we confronted Eva the waitress, followed by the lingerie shopping, raised her mood to a distinctly amorous point. </p><p>And, now, when her body inevitably reacted to the threatening presence of Tara, her reaction was a jumble of fear and excitement. In a way, it reminded me of Daria’s mood. However, there was an important difference. </p><p>Daria was invulnerable, and danger was merely cosmetic to her. Emily had no such luxury. Yet, that didn’t prevent her from glancing at the door for a moment before she shivered, showing how excited she was getting. “Well, I should start working, then,” she whispered suggestively as her hands moved down, finally giving me a proper view of her breasts in the shelf bra. </p><p>Then, she turned her back, shaking her ass invitingly, which looked particularly fascinating when framed by the red garter belt. </p><p>Beautiful indeed. </p><p>“Is there no way I could convince you to help me directly…” she whispered as she leaned forward, pressing her breasts together with her arms while she shook her body gently.</p><p>“And, what would I get in return.” </p><p>“I would be so very grateful for your support,” she answered, her tone somehow managing to promise more than her revealing state. </p><p>“As long as I receive an advance payment,” I answered as I took a step forward. </p><p>But, at that point, another noise reached my ears. The ringing of a bell. It was once again Tara … but this time, it was not one for entertainment. She was informing me that we had an intruder. </p><p>It looked like my luck had finally run out. </p>",

    "content": "<p>As I chatted with Emily, enjoying our drinks while waiting for our food, I was doing my best to give signals of distress I was trying to suppress. I wanted Emily to take the initiative to prompt me about the reason for the urgent meeting. </p><p>Asking about my distress first would give me the chance to exaggerate the situation as much as I wished without looking absurd. By asking first and ‘ruining’ the mood of the dinner I had ‘worked’ so hard to set, she would feel obligated to help me. </p><p>Naturally, it was not a trick that would work on anyone. Daria, for example, would have just laughed at it and ignored it, too strong-willed to be affected by such a trick. </p><p>Emily was not as strong. </p><p>However, it turned out to be harder than I expected. And, ironically, it was because I was too successful earlier. Still riding the high of the earlier experience, Emily missed a great number of nonverbal signals, to the point that, if it wasn’t for my power confirming her obliviousness, I would have assumed she was ignoring those deliberately. </p><p>Talk about being a victim of my own success. </p><p>We were halfway through the dinner — brought by a different waitress, with Eva choosing to stay away — when I decided to ignore any hint of subtlety and sighed loudly, like an old married couple’s passive-aggressive communication. That barely penetrated through Emily’s bubble of happiness. “What’s wrong?” she asked. </p><p>“Nothing that’s worth ruining our incredible dinner,” I said. “I value this moment of calm too much to ruin…” </p><p>Like that wouldn’t have ruined. </p><p>Emily’s expression finally changed from her bliss, and a frown half-appeared, followed by an expression of realization. “You called me here for an emergency. Why didn’t you open with that?” she asked. </p><p>“Well, I was … but then that waitress disrespected you, and I wanted to help,” I said, trying to frame what I had done as a great sacrifice I had done for Emily’s sake.</p><p>Her flash of guilt was exactly what I had wanted. “I’m sorry. I was just annoyed by her disrespect. I shouldn’t have let it forget what’s important. I’m here to help you.” </p><p>“Really? Even if it could be risky? You know my situation, being forced to work for a villain,” I said, looking stoic, with just the right amount of pitiful mixed in even as I reminded her of my situation, including my work for my non-existent boss. </p><p>It was a good time to remind her about this fact. She was feeling a mixture of pleasure and pity, which would help her trivialize the threat and commit to helping me more easily, especially since what I was asking was a small thing. Then, the next time, it would be another small thing … until, she was entangled with my web. </p><p>Oh, it would be not without its rewards. I would offer her a far better life than what she could find working as a mere receptionist, but not without risks. </p><p>Risks that I was doing my best to minimize for the moment. </p><p>Not a nice thing, but hardly the worst misdirection a beautiful young woman might have encountered. </p><p>“I’m willing to take any risk for you,” she declared proudly. And, at this moment, she truly believed it, but I didn’t take it seriously. It was no different than declaring that she would run a marathon for me, without realizing the difficulty of it. It was easy to start, but hard to continue. </p><p>Luckily, what I needed was nothing more than an application of her power in a safe location. “Really?” I asked, hopeful and vulnerable; all artificial.</p><p>She nodded. “I … I will, no matter how tough,” she declared emptily. </p><p>I didn’t say anything, just grabbed her hand and kissed her palm gently. She blushed. “I need your help to set up a security system,” I said. “They were impressed with my abilities, and they want me to set a bigger one. They believed I could do it, since I didn’t need their help to gather information.” </p><p>“Oh, poor you,” Emily said, believing the underlying tragedy easily as she left her seat to hug me tightly, showing her sympathy. “Why didn’t you talk to me before things got overwhelming.” </p><p>“I didn’t want to bother you with my problems,” I whispered. She hugged me tighter. “I can’t ask you to always —” </p><p>“You’re not asking, I’m offering,” she said thoughtfully, which I appreciated. I murmured numbly as I hugged her tightly. We stayed like that for a moment. “Shall we leave?” she asked. </p><p>“Let’s walk,” I replied as I left the cash on the table, along with more than what I promised as a tip, hugged Emily, and together, we left the cafe. </p><p>Once we left, I started explaining exactly what I needed from a technical perspective, which took a while. </p><p>She smiled as she listened to details, which was a good sign. “Changing the way they work would be easy as long as they are not password-protected, especially since you bought a good computer for me to use as a vector,” she answered. “It shouldn’t take more than ten minutes.” </p><p>An expression of surprise appeared on my face, which, unlike the earlier story of a tragedy, was a genuine one. I had expected it to take at least three hours with the sheer number she needed to handle. “Really, even with more than a thousand devices,” I said. </p><p>“Certainly,” she said, her expression smug. </p><p>“Your training with the computer going well, then?” I said. </p><p>“Yes,” she said as she hugged me. “Using computers as intermediaries is making things really easy. It’s all thanks to you that I can do it.” </p><p>That development surpassed my expectations, and made me glad that I was working hard to tie her to me. Her lack of strategic thought was working for me. All she needed was to go to the Guild and mention that she had discovered a new, wondrous application of her power, and she would be promoted. </p><p>Nothing truly fancy, but considering the nature of her power, and the ease she could probably bury traps to anything she manipulated with her tech power, but certainly comfortable and well-paying. </p><p>So, I better nip that in the bud, before she even considered it. </p><p>“It’s good news,” I said happily, then let my face flash with distress and fear. </p><p>“What’s wrong?” she asked. </p><p>“Be careful never to reveal that to your bosses,” I said even as I grabbed her arms tightly. </p><p>“I - I won’t … but why?” she said, surprised. </p><p>“We know that the heroes are a paranoid bunch, and they are not as respectful to laws as they claim,” I explained. “What if they believe that you were aware of that capability all along, and infiltrated their guild to steal their information. What if…” I continued, then let my voice fade, cutting my words halfway just as her terror became palpable. “I’m sorry. I’m just reflecting on my own experiences. I’m sure it won’t go as badly for you,” I completed, my tone one of desperation covered with a layer of hope that even Emily could penetrate easily. </p><p>“There’s nothing to be sorry about. You’re just worried for me,” Emily answered gently as she hugged me, and chose not to talk about it. I momentarily overcharged my powers, just to confirm her determination. </p><p>Everything I had seen confirmed that she had believed in my explanation. Admittedly, it was mostly because it had been a reasonable explanation. The New Giant Force was not above capturing and forcing a support hero to work for them, as the puzzle had implied. </p><p>“What, now?” she asked. </p><p>“Now, we’re going to shopping to get you some new clothes,” I said. </p><p>She quirked her eyebrow, surprised. “Is this the time for it? I thought that it was urgent.” </p><p>“It’s about it. We need to make sure you’re properly disguised before we go. It’s safer that way,” I said. “Unfortunately, it won’t be the sexy clothes that you deserve this time.” </p><p>“Oh, really?” she said, smiling once again. “And, what if I need those sexy clothing.” </p><p>I chuckled. “Why? You look much better-wearing nothing,” I answered, then kissed her, a perfect way to destroy the earlier gloom. </p><p>“And, how am I going to dress? Like a villain?” she whispered once she pulled back. “May we buy spandex. I’ll look amazing in spandex.” </p><p>“As much it’s tempting to watch you trying to stuff those into spandex,” I said as I squeezed her ass, enjoying her moan in response, “this time, your disguise will be rather boring, I’m afraid…”</p><p>“Hmm,” she muttered as she looked around, before her gaze pinned to the lingerie shop near us. “As long as I’m allowed to dress up underneath.” </p><p>She was treating the mission like a fun outing rather than a dangerous affair, which I had no problem with. After all, the whole point was to let her experience the illegal side without being scared. “You have a deal.” </p>",

    "content": "<p>When Aisnam returned, it was already noon, and she was once again in her servant's disguise. Physically, she looked fine, which didn’t surprise me. </p><p>Cultivators had far bigger explosive potential, but one thing they lagged behind was endurance. It took a lot of time to absorb Qi, and even longer to actually subdue it enough that it could be used for their techniques, limiting the amount of fighting they could do under limited circumstances. On the contrary, martial arts essence was far easier to recover, allowing them to fight longer. </p><p>That would have affected Aisnam, considering she had spent the whole night fighting as a cultivator, if it wasn’t for one important difference. She fought while disguising herself as an injured Second Stage cultivator rather than an Eight Stage one, which meant she was in tip-top shape.</p><p>That didn’t mean it hadn’t been difficult mentally. All night, she had been walking a tightrope as she pulled a double-bluff, trying to convince any direct observer that she was at her last rope, injured and about to die, while also trying to convince the large Tiger Fist army that they were dealing with a cultivator that wasn’t as weak as the stories suggested. </p><p>I emphasized her difficulties. I had dealt with similar challenges, but unlike me, she didn’t have a System to help her smooth out any mistakes. </p><p>So, the moment she entered, I greeted her with a hug. “Thank the immortals you’re not injured,” I muttered as I hugged her. “I was worried.” </p><p>“There’s no reason to worry. I was with Her Highness, and no harm could come to me,” she answered, but made no move to stop my hug. </p><p>“It’s the battlefield. There are always accidents,” I answered as I explained my worry. We said nothing while I hugged her, letting her relax. She needed it. </p><p>While she experienced no physical danger during the battle, that didn’t mean that it had been easy. She had spent almost a day putting an act, where a mistake might bring more trouble than she could handle. And, her stress was evident. I started rubbing her back, once again putting my massage talent to good use. </p><p>“Do you want to tell me what happened?” I said once I led her to a seat, stood at her back, and started rubbing her shoulders. But, I asked that question only after the worst of her stress had been drained. </p><p>“Nothing much to tell. We have managed to deal with the assassins, but most of the royal family had already been killed. Luckily, one of the young princes was alive, and Her Highness deigned to take the role of the regent until the prince grew up.” </p><p>“Very good,” I said as I continued rubbing her shoulders, not asking any inconvenient questions like whether there was actually a surviving prince, or why a cultivator of Eight Stage took hours before he could reach the inner circle. </p><p>Politics was not my problem, nor something I was capable of. The system didn’t count the local political knowledge as a skill — why it was different from others, I didn’t know — so I couldn’t cheat. And, I didn’t want to waste months as I tried to learn the complicated political structure of the mortal kingdoms. </p><p>Aisnam was capable enough to handle the rest, especially since she could always receive some assistance from her mysterious allies in case of an emergency. </p><p>“There will be a coronation ceremony the next morning. You should come and be rewarded.”</p><p>“Thanks, but I rather not,” I said, and she looked up, shocked. I leaned down to kiss her, and pulled back after a considerable delay. </p><p>“Why?” she stammered, blushing after the kiss. “It’s a great honor, and the Queen will be very generous.” </p><p>“I don’t need anything but your company,” I said before kissing her again. This time, she responded even more passionately. I continued talking once we stopped. “I’m guessing you’re going to live here to take care of the security of that stone gate,” I said. </p><p>“Yes,” she said. </p><p>”Good. I can stay here and accompany you,” I said, and then a naughty smirk spread only my face. “And, without the Queen here to ruin our fun, we can use the whole palace for our fun. I had my eye on one of the balconies for a long time —” I continued, interrupted by a poke to my side. </p><p>“You’re so bad,” she said, but her giggles didn’t sound particularly argumentative. </p><p>Her thoughts were easy to read. I had no doubt that, with her taking the role of the Regent, she would not only be extremely busy, but she would have to spend all her public appearances playing the role of the sickly yet valiant Queen. Boring and stressful. </p><p>“I would have to stay with Her Highness to serve her,” she said reluctantly. </p><p>“Good. Then, I could serve you during the night, balancing things out—” I started, earning another playful slap, followed by a giggle.</p><p>She sighed. “At least you won’t need to risk yourself communicating with the mysterious apothecaries. The Queen will be sending her servants to deal with the trade.” </p><p>“Good. It means more time for training,” I said. It would have been inconvenient before I had received my formation skill, but now that reached Perfection, I could easily set an exchange location that would keep my identity hidden even against her. </p><p>I feared no Qi Gathering cultivator as long as I had the luxury of setting up the field beforehand. It was already challenging for cultivators to fight against an ordinary formation master, who was limited by the amount of Qi that they could channel during an emergency. Channeling Qi of spirit stones or other sources took a longer time. </p><p>With my Inventory, my constraints were much laxer. </p><p>After she informed me of the change in the trade, the silence fell to the palace for a while. I was the one to break it. “So, what are the next steps?” I asked. </p><p>“We don’t know. It depends on what Tiger Fist army does, and how the other cities would react. Markas will support us, but with Tiger Fist army between us, there was a limit on how much they could support.” </p><p>“Can’t the Queen just go out and deal with them? She’s strong enough.” </p><p>“No. She doesn’t have much freedom. The Covenant forbids cultivators from interfering with the mortal battles. The last night was alright, because they attacked her home. Regency is a bit more problematic, but unless the sects decide to intervene directly, she could use that temporary position as an excuse to defend the royal residence. Even operating the rest of the capital would be problematic … anywhere else, it would bring punishment to her.” </p><p>“Sounds complicated.” </p><p>She sighed. “I haven’t even started. There are still martial artists quotas, taxes to the cultivation families and sects, the relationship with the other cities, generals … it’ll be a mess. I don’t know what we’ll do if our trade partners decide to stop providing us or change the prices. We need a lot of essence pills.” </p><p>I shrugged. “We’ll figure a way if it comes to that. There’s no need to borrow trouble from the future.” It was easy to console her when I was the one responsible for those decisions. </p><p>“You’re right,” she said as she pulled a letter and stood up. </p><p>“Another delivery?” I asked. </p><p>“The last one,” she said. “Her Highness explained the procedures for the new trade deliveries, so you don’t have to worry about it anymore. You don’t have to do anything but rest.” </p><p>As she said that, she prepared to leave. That would not do. “Sounds like a fun time. I need to work on my techniques as well,” I said. “Watching you practice that palm technique, in particular, taught me a lot.” </p><p>“I’m happy that it could help,” she said. “Unfortunately, with everything, we won’t have much time together. Even now, I have to go and deal with the political mess.” </p><p>“Not immediately, right?” I asked as I rubbed the small of her back. </p><p>“Well, Her Highness is waiting for me…” she murmured, but her whisper was far more suggestive than determined. It was easier to ignore one’s boss when said boss was actually imaginary. Or, was it her job that was the imaginary one … acting multiple roles was complicated. </p><p>“Then, tell her we had some emergency about the trade or something. It’s not like she can’t handle your absence for some time.” As I said that, the hug started to turn into … more. </p><p>“Well, there’s no harm in a few minutes —” she started, which turned into a playful yelp soon enough. </p><p>I chuckled. “It’s cute that you think you can get away with just a few minutes.” She blushed. I continued. “Since the Queen is not here anymore, why don’t we play some games. Maybe make some noise.” </p><p>“I don’t know…” she whispered, then pushed me back with a big smile. “You have to catch me first.” </p><p>She ran. </p><p>I chased… </p>",

    "content": "<p>As I watched Aisman fight, I was making notes about the way to use the Palm of Verdant cleansing in combat situations. I might have the perfect understanding of the skill itself, but that didn’t automatically come with contextual understanding. </p><p>Also, watching someone with higher cultivation use the technique was a different thing. She was able to use some of the more advanced moves in a way I couldn’t do with just two active gates, which helped me a lot. </p><p>Of course, that was only because of my own Perfect skill, allowing me to dissect her moves in a way only a master could do. </p><p>Curious how any further improvement would affect my understanding, I decided to trigger the latest set of rewards I had received. The others were nice, but the real difference was the palm technique, which was the only one that went through a breakthrough.</p><p>The new formation around the Spring Palace was strong enough to keep that momentary glow contained, so I didn’t move away while Aisnam continued to fight. The new information about the palm technique filled my mind, and my perspective on Aisnam’s fight changed once more. </p><p>Not only did I get a better understanding of her strategies, which she was building based on her stronger perception and reaction speed, but also I developed a deeper list of her mistakes. I was already capable of seeing her tactical mistakes due to the gap between the two skills, but the difference between Perfection and Minor Immersion was like the difference between day and night. </p><p>Before, I could still enjoy the fight despite her lower skill, but once I reached Minor Immersion, that was gone. The number of mistakes I could see multiplied, turning it into a frustrating experience. Like I had mild OCD while walking in a museum of crooked paintings. </p><p>Luckily, that wasn’t bad enough that I had to leave. I just needed to focus on something other than her battle. </p><p>Like, exactly what had been going on. Their claim that the Zaim family had already been assassinated was interesting, but only in a theoretical manner. I might have a different opinion of the Tiger Fist army had been trying to invade the capital with their army — well, even more than they already did — which would end up in a bloodbath, I might have been tempted to intervene, though even that, I wasn’t sure. </p><p>I was self-aware enough to know that I was a selfish person. </p><p>However, the Royal Family didn’t even deserve that momentary consideration from me. The only one that I cared about was Aisnam, and since she was content prioritizing selling her injured state rather than trying to help the rest of the Royal Family, I was happy to follow her lead. </p><p>Pearyin fought for ten minutes, letting them push her toward the gate of the Spring Palace, where she would be seen by others. “Fight harder, morons. We’ll be noticed. I don’t want to fight our way out,” one of them said. “We need to leave before they discover the body of the King. Pull the weapons.” </p><p>“But I thought we were going to keep them.” </p><p>“You should have fought harder, then. Do you want to explain to the commander that we failed,” the first one countered even as he reached to his belt and pulled a dagger? The others did the same. The daggers didn’t look new, showing the signs of time and usage, but each had a spirit stone buried in their hilt. </p><p>Qi weapons that martial artists could use. “No! You’ll die even if I die myself,” Aisnam shouted loudly. Loud enough for every guard to hear. She pulled a dagger, one that glowed visibly, looking like it was an incredible cultivation artifact.</p><p>It was an ordinary dagger. </p><p>As Aisnam pulled the dagger, she even used the opportunity to bite some kind of small pill. Then, she spat out blood and trembled. “Excellent acting,” I muttered even as I watched her. She acted good enough that, if I wasn’t Qi-sensitive, I might have actually fallen for her trick. And, I certainly didn’t expect her to prepare some kind of blood capsule to fake coughing blood. </p><p>It was a good lesson. Just because cultivators were arrogant and reckless didn’t mean that they were above using dirty tricks to create misunderstandings. I wasn’t the only person in the world who understood the value of information. </p><p>Once Aisnam pulled that dagger, the Tiger Fist assassins dashed forward, pushing themselves to the limit as they wanted to take Aisnam down, but it was pointless. Aisnam killed one with a mere slash of Qi. No skill, just a burst of power that left several cracks on the knife as she tried to make it look like she was using a disposable artifact. </p><p> The second attack was missed, and the Tiger Fist assassins started running away. Aisnam chased them. “Assassins. Defend the royal family!” she shouted, her voice enhanced with her Qi, spreading every part of the palace and a good part of the city. </p><p>She slowed down noticeably, acting like using the dagger tired her out. But, the assassins continued to run away, but once they had reached the outer ring of the royal district, she had killed a second one. Meanwhile, the other two escaped. </p><p>More accurately, she had let them escape. “Guards, at arms!” she said. She looked damaged and exhausted, occasionally coughing fake blood, totaling far more than what she might have possessed in her body. </p><p>I watched the rest of the show from the roof while Aisnam ‘valiantly’ led the royal guards toward the palace, surrounding some of the assassins who had decided to raid the treasury after their victory. </p><p>The assassins were not a small force. Ten connate realm Tiger Fist Connate Ream martial artists, and six Royal Guards who decided to support the winning side. Well, at least, what they thought to be the winning side. And that didn’t factor in the four assassins that had been dealt with. On Aisnam’s side, there were only six Connate Realm martial artists, and all of them were already wounded. </p><p>Some of the royal guards ran away, thinking those odds were impossible to face, while some stayed with her despite what seemed to be impossible odds. </p><p>I stayed on the roof, making no move to support her. After all, I knew of her true strength, not just in reality, but also in my role as the wandering martial artist. Therefore, I didn’t need to ruin her plans to play more roles. I stayed at the Spring Palace, protecting her home instead. </p><p>I was glad that I watched the battle from such a great distance, away from the blood and gore. Meanwhile, Aisnam played the resistance as chess, using her fake artifact whenever the assassins and their collaborators seemed ready to win. </p><p>With every Connate Realm martial artist falling, the loyalist palace guards turned more passionate, their fallen comrades unable to blunt their enthusiasm. Whenever she pulled back, looking more and more exhausted — but only looking — she had delivered some inspiring words, calling the soldiers to defend the kingdom and save the king. </p><p>A man who had long deceased. </p><p>When the battle extended, I started to frown. I could see that she was using the counter-attack against the assassins in a way to establish her prestige, but I was worried about a pincer attack from the Tiger Fist army. </p><p>Since the Spring Palace was guarded by my formation, there was no harm for me to leave momentarily. I passed the weakened outer defenses easily, wanting to see exactly what the Tiger Fist army was planning. </p><p>I didn’t want to intervene, but there were certain strategies that might force me. But, when I arrived at the outer walls, what I had seen surprised me. </p><p>Tiger Fist army was retreating from the capital with great haste. </p><p>“I see,” I muttered as I remembered the scene of Aisnam letting the two Connate Realm martial artists escape. Their news, combined with the other Connate realm martial artists unable to get away must have given them the impression that Aisnam was stronger than she had first shown. </p><p>But that impression was temporary. Their spies would eventually report the details of the fight, and they would realize they missed their golden opportunity. </p><p>I had to admit. It was an elegant plan. By using a fake artifact, Aisnam not only intimidated an army, but she also did so in a way that didn’t reveal her full strength. She was still that injured cultivator, and only with a broken artifact she was able to fight against a few Connate realm martial artists. </p><p>There was nothing for me to do. I returned to the Spring Palace, and started to play with the formation. My objective, create a small hidden apothecary that could automate some of the processing through formations. </p><p>After all, I could easily imagine her next move. She was going to ask her mysterious trade partners for a lot of essence pills and other martial artist supplements. </p><p>Things would be very convenient if I didn’t need to go to Markas for every order… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Three days. </p><p>It took a week after I had helped Pearyin move to Markas before things at the capital had come ahead. A week that I had mostly spent in Capital, only occasionally leaving to check with Pearyin and develop the formation further whenever I went out to ‘facilitate the trade’.</p><p>It all came ahead in the middle of the night. We were … studying when the interruption arrived in the form of four Connate Realm artists approaching the Spring Palace. I noticed them the moment they had tripped the formation I had set at the perimeter. </p><p>Merely equivalent to a trip wire, alerting me of unexpected arrivals. It was a beautiful formation, as while simple, it was also nearly invisible. I was confident that it wouldn’t be noticed even by a peak Qi Gathering cultivator. </p><p>At this point, my Nabata-style formation skill had already reached Perfection, which increased the flexibility of my formations significantly. A mere trip-wire had turned into a work of art. Moreover, it was not the only change I had made. I had updated the formation around the house significantly, turning it into a nasty trap against anyone except Aisnam. </p><p>It was also the reason I didn’t react to the approach of the Connate realm artists, not even wondering whether they were Tiger Fists, or they were palace guards. Either way, even assuming Aisnam didn’t notice their approach — unlikely with her cultivation, even with my skillful … studying — there was nothing they could do. </p><p>That turned out to be unnecessary. Aisnam stopped a few seconds later. “We have intruders,” she said. </p><p>As she stopped, the System finally triggered the rewards I had been collecting all day. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 50; Pampering Bonus - 75 (Capped)]</p><p>[125x Return - Calligraphy Lesson- Major Immersion]</p><p>[125x Return - Verdant Brush Talisman Technique Lesson - Major Immersion]</p><p>[125x Return - Nataba Formation Technique Lesson - Perfection]</p><p>[125x Return - Palm of Verdant Cleansing - Perfection, Minor Immersion]</p><p>Not a bad haul. I finally received a chance to improve my Verdant Cleansing even further. Pity I couldn’t spar to test its benefits. Aisnam was out, for obvious reasons, but even Pearyin was not a good candidate. She had already reached Major Immersion after a day’s practice, and I was afraid of the effects of the next skill improvement. </p><p>The last thing I needed was my efforts to keep the formation hidden and wasted. </p><p>“Is there anything I can do?” I asked. </p><p>“Stay here and guard the Spring Palace. I will go out with the Queen and see the reason for the Tiger Fist to actually dare to invade the palace. Don’t forget what we agreed,” she said as she dressed. </p><p>Interesting. After a week of siege, I gave the Royal Family a higher likelihood. </p><p>“I’ll stay inside. I won’t try to conserve spirit stones and use the Verdant Sword against the enemies if they attack, and the moment a cultivator appears, I will trigger the fireworks and go into the tunnel,” I said, summarizing our plans, which was skewed toward protecting me rather than the Spring Palace. </p><p>Aisnam was growing very protective of her boy toy, which I appreciated. </p><p>“Also, stay out of the windows. We don’t know who’s watching,” she warned. She didn’t say anything else as she went upstairs. Naturally, I ignored her last comment I went toward the window, but activated a little concealment feature that I added to the Spring Palace. </p><p>One of many convenient features I had installed to formation that could only activated by me. At this point, I could confidently work on my skills in a room while Aisnam cultivated upstairs, confident that it would stay a secret. </p><p>Spring Palace was my domain now. </p><p>Including the escape tunnel. </p><p>Aisnam jumped out of the window a moment later, once again in her Queen identity, but this time, not the dark-colored one she wore when she sneaked out. It was a green dress with leaves, one that gave a domineering feeling, complete with some kind of stylized mask. </p><p>This time, assuming that I would follow her request, she didn’t even bother with the puppet she dragged around to maintain her double identity. </p><p>She appeared in front of the Tiger Fist martial artists, a hundred feet away. “Explain yourself. How dare you enter the domain of this Queen uninvited,” she asked in a formal tone. </p><p>Interestingly, none of the Connate realm martial artists stopped, but they slowed down. “We are sorry, exalted cultivator, but from now on, there’s no Zaim Royal family,” their leader said. His words were formal,, but his tone was smug and domineering. “You’re the last one to be removed.” </p><p>“You dare to attack a cultivator?” she asked, her tone scandalized. She was having trouble comprehending a martial artist daring to fight against a cultivator. I chuckled. Apparently, in her fury, she had forgotten that she was supposed to be injured. </p><p>Her opponent was kind enough to remind her. “Your injury is not a big secret, exalted cultivator,” he said. </p><p>I noticed Aisnam’s posture shuffle as she suppressed her momentary flare. She might have been caught flat-footed by the sudden intrusion, but that didn’t change the fact that she was a cultivator who worked for decades to improve, and tempered by her family’s betrayal. </p><p>“And, you are ready to face the anger of the Verdant family? Do you think they will accept one of them being killed by a mere martial artist,” she declared, but I was too familiar with her not to notice her outrage was fake. </p><p>She was baiting them to reveal more information. A smart strategy, but I didn’t miss the other implication. She wasn’t in a particular hurry to go and check the status of the other members of the Royal Family, even after Tiger Fist had declared that they had all been killed. </p><p>I didn’t blame her. Even back in my world, royal families were hardly the cuddliest entities. Moreover, there was hardly any love lost between her and their husband who abandoned her to wither and die in the Spring Palace, even going as far as sending experts to hasten her demise. </p><p>“There’s nothing to be worried about, exalted cultivator. We have merely learned that the Zaim family had been about to kill an exalted cultivator such as yourself, and decided to invade the palace to a great risk to ourselves. Unfortunately, we were too late, so we killed the Zaim family to the last member. We might even be rewarded by the Verdant family,” he said. </p><p>I had to admit, it was not a bad plan. If I hadn’t gone all the way to the cultivator market to pick the medicine to repair her gates, which reversed her declining cultivation back to the Eight Stage, she would have lost against four Connate Realm martial artists. </p><p>Especially since, their confidence implied that they had some tricks of their own. Maybe they had a weapon similar to the Verdant Sword that could be used by the martial artists, or maybe they had some one-time treasures that could counter any trick she might bear. </p><p>Or maybe, they had discovered that all of Aisnam’s trump cards had been taken by her family after her injury, and they were confident that they could take her down easily. </p><p>In the end, it didn’t matter. The gap between an injured Second Stage and an Eight Stage with perfect condition was bigger than an ordinary civilian and a Connate Martial artist. No matter their preparations, it didn’t matter. </p><p>It was an excellent opportunity to spread some misinformation. </p><p>I wished that I could go and explain to Aisnam to keep her abilities hidden, but that was not a luxury I had. For once, I wasn’t supposed to be watching her. </p><p>More importantly, I had already been skirting dangerous waters by helping her trade with a third party, and I didn’t want to get involved more. I still didn’t fully know the limits of the System, but it would be very inconvenient if Aisnam stopped triggering rewards as well. </p><p>Then, the fight started. </p><p>“Good girl,” I muttered as I watched Aisnam fight against the four Connate martial artists at the same time, only to be pushed back, like she was facing against stronger enemies. </p><p>She used the Palm of Verdant Cleansing style against the attackers, easily dancing between their attempts, but not ‘strong’ enough to counterattack, only hanging due to the profound nature of her technique. </p><p>Technically, if she was actually still in the Second Stage, she couldn’t have fought that smoothly, and would have been defeated as soon as her Qi was depleted. While cultivators had many advantages against the martial artists, their weakest aspect was endurance. </p><p>A cultivator of Second Stage would have been drained easily even by a simple technique like the Palm of the Verdant Cleansing. </p><p>But, only a cultivator could make that assessment, and they needed to be familiar with the technique. And, since her performance was solidly in Minor Accomplishment, that was only possible if the Verdant family had sent an observer that had been stronger than the disposable disciples that chased me at the cultivator market. </p><p>Not very likely.</p>",

    "content": "<p>“D-did you finish fixing my dress?” Lillian asked as she shuffled cutely, pulling her shirt down. </p><p>“Almost,” I said as I did my best to turn her dress into something wearable with a needle out of stone and coarse sewing thread I had managed to fashion out of plant fiber that I picked when I went out for scouting. </p><p>I didn’t tease her about her consciousness about nudity being a bit late after what we had just done, but it was difficult. </p><p>“How do you know how to make threads out of plants?” she asked. </p><p>“You learn a lot of things during hunting trips. Compared to some of the esoteric tricks, making ropes and threads is pretty basic.  So is sewing,” I said. “And, how come you don’t know how to sew. I thought it was a favorite among the nobles.” </p><p>“Not our family. We are too busy —” she started, then paused as a conflicted expression passed  over her face, “learning how to farm.” </p><p>I acted like I didn’t notice her close call. She had stumbled on her druidic heritage, but she didn’t want to talk about it. I didn’t want to push her, especially when there was no immediate benefit to it. </p><p>Still, unaware that her secret was not as hidden as she might think,  she was anxious to change the topic. “So, what was that blast that was with …” she said, only to freeze. She had just stumbled over another topic that she was uncomfortable with. </p><p>“Well, you know as much as I do. It’s another effect of my failed breakthrough. It’s not harmful, right?” I didn’t think so, as it was, she wouldn’t have asked for multiple doses. </p><p>“No … not particularly at least,” she whispered. “I just realized it turned into vitae easier than I expected.” </p><p>“Really?” I asked. “That’s good, because it reduced the pressure I had been quite a bit as well.” </p><p>She nodded. “That’s good news.” </p><p>I smirked. “Of course, you know what it means.” She looked at me questioningly. “It means that we need to do it often to prevent a disaster.” </p><p>My response was a small ball of water hitting my face and a furious blush as she turned away. I chuckled as I continued repairing her dress, not teasing her anymore. </p><p>“Your dress is ready,” I said, then looked at the piece in my hands, which was essentially rags. I was able to sew, but it was merely something functional. I was not a tailor, and the remains of the dress were hopeful. </p><p>“Turn your back,” she said, still blushing. I followed her request, ignoring my desire to tease her about it, no matter how tempting it felt. “You can look back,” she added soon after. </p><p>“Impressive,” I said. </p><p>“What’s impressive.” </p><p>“That you can still look good despite my terrible tailoring,” I replied. </p><p>“S-shut up,” she stammered, her blush beautiful. Then, she looked at the cave entrance, the sunlight absent. “It’s time to move, right?” she said. </p><p>“Almost,” I said. “The battle against the beasts had ended a while ago, and there’s a chance that they are still at the shore. I want to give them another half an hour before we go out.”  </p><p>“Maybe we should just stay in the cave. They might just believe that we have been consumed by the beasts,” she said. </p><p>I shook my head. “No, if they believed that, they would have sailed away in the middle of the day rather than trying to hunt down every third-order beast on the island. Without finding a body, at least bones, they wouldn’t stop.” </p><p>“I see —” she started, then froze. “Then, does it mean you would have been safe if you had just sacrificed me—” she started. </p><p>I sighed as I closed the distance and silenced her with a flick to her nose. “Maybe, but it’s not something I would do, so there’s no point talking about it. I might not be a hero, but I’m not a monster either.” </p><p>She said nothing but just hugged me. “You’re my hero,” she whispered. </p><p>I let her hug me while we waited, her presence even more comforting after our shared closeness. “So, you were saying that my mana turned into vitae easier? How easier?” </p><p>She sighed. “It’s hard to quantify, but usually, expanding my vitae requires me to meditate and work on my technique for weeks, and even then, it starts —” </p><p>“Watered down?” I interrupted, which earned a jab to my side. </p><p>“That was a terrible pun. Never do it again,” she said before continuing. “It starts weak, and requires quite a bit time to match the initial vitae that had been generated during the breakthrough.” </p><p>“And the mana you have been … gifted —” I said, earning another painful poke. </p><p>“You’re pushing your luck,” she said, but considering she continued to hug me, she wasn’t as serious as she tried to convince me. “I just needed to meditate and focus on my conception of water for merely an hour before it transformed completely, rather than the days it required.” </p><p>“Was it the case for mana from the dragon heart as well?” I asked as I suddenly tensed, realizing the implications of what she was saying.”   </p><p>“No, that was no different from ordinary mana. Purer, but otherwise no different.” </p><p>“You know that you can never reveal that to anyone, right?” I asked. Her tone and her position were already a silent declaration of such, but it was not a bad idea to be clear on such topics. </p><p>She chuckled. “Oh, don’t worry. I don’t want to spend my life as an experimental subject any more than you do. I know exactly what it would do if the Patrician families even suspected such a possibility.” </p><p>“Well, maybe they won’t target you—” I started. She poked again. “Come on, woman. Careful of that finger, or I start poking  back in revenge.” </p><p>Her blush was beautiful. “Shut up! You know what I mean.” </p><p>“Alright. No more teasing. I know what you’re trying to say. There’s no way they would let the only witness go free.” I paused, thinking for a moment, before I decided to reveal my knowledge of her abilities. It was a good time to inform her that. “And, since you used some kind of blood magic that  kept me alive, you’re hardly only a witness.” </p><p>This time, it was her that tensed. She tried to pull back, but I hugged her waist gently. She didn’t try to pull back. “You know about it?” she asked. </p><p>“Yes. Whatever pattern you had drawn was long gone, but the cut in your palm was rather obvious. Together with the impossibility of your situation, and your family occupation, connecting the dots wasn't too difficult. Your family doesn’t have a swamp with water-affinity, right?” </p><p>“We do … but we use some ancestral magic to increase the yield. We keep it hidden. Since the Boudican Revolts, especially after the third one, it’s not exactly something accepted. Our family decided it’s much safer to keep it hidden.” </p><p>“Believe me, I understand. While I’m sure my own family had no secrets—” I quipped, which made her start giggling. Understandable, as the thought of a Patrician family that could trace its existence back to the founding of the Republic having no secrets was a joke. The fact that my grandfather had a dragon heart despite being from a family of exile was one of them. </p><p>I wondered how many secrets that had been destroyed in that letter that had been burned … and how many secrets that had been lost during centuries of exile, never to be discovered again. </p><p>What a waste. </p><p>Lillian continued giggling, which soon started to gain a hysterical quality. It had been a long day. I wished I had the luxury of letting her rest, but with what was about to come, her assistance was vital. </p><p> I decided to distract her in a fun way. With a kiss. </p><p>As my lips touched hers, she froze for a moment, her blush beautiful, but it didn’t take long for her to respond. A fun way to solve her stress. Too bad that we didn’t have the time to explore the more advanced methods … again. </p><p>“It’s already past midnight. It’s the best time to start moving,” I said. </p><p>“So, no waiting and hoping we’ll be safe?” she asked. </p><p>“No, we need to take some risk. However, when I scouted earlier, I had already seen that they had a team on the shore, and their boat was ready. Once we steal it, we can use it to go to the mainland. Gaul shores are not too far away from the island.”  </p><p>She sighed. “I hope you’re right and we can get away unnoticed. Because otherwise…” </p><p>“Don’t worry. I’m a Scipio. We’re famous for our tactical brilliance,” I said, conveniently ignoring the fact that, as a bastard, I had never been trained about military tactics like it was traditional, and only as a warrior. </p><p>Still, it helped to calm Lillian down, which was all that was important right now. </p><p>We had a boat to steal. </p>",

    "content": "<p>As Lillian faced me, her beauty was captivating. She was wearing nothing but drenched and scrapped remains of her fancy dress, but as it gathered around her waist, somehow, it looked on her. Her arms were at her chest, trying to cover her breasts shyly, but not entirely succeeding. The droplets that remained of her magical bath made it look even more spectacular. </p><p>She was certainly blessed on the subject of curves.  </p><p>Yet, the sexiest part of her looks was her smile. Eager yet shy at the same time while she caught my gaze despite not having anywhere near a good view. “What are you waiting for?” she whispered. </p><p>“I’m trying to capture it for posterity,” I answered as I took a small step forward. She let her arms fall to her side, revealing her breasts for my hungry gaze. The next step came much faster. Then, she took a step of her own, making them tumble slightly. </p><p>I decided that using my new, enhanced speed was acceptable. I ended up in front of her. My arms wrapped around her waist, hers were only a fraction of a second slower as they wrapped around my neck, and I  felt her lips over mine. </p><p>Her breasts felt amazing as they pressed against my naked chest, and her tongue felt even better as it invaded my mouth, her passion burning a fire that was impossible to squish. I was lucky that she seemed just as reluctant to stop. </p><p>I stopped grabbing her waist tightly, but only because it turned unnecessary when she jumped and wrapped her legs around my waist. My hands started wandering around her body, enjoying her naked skin once more. I wanted to push her down and take her … but I also wanted the kiss to last forever. </p><p>A difficult dilemma. </p><p>Lillian decided to solve it before me. One of her hands wandered down, and tugged my pants, freeing me from the last piece of my clothing. I tried to replicate it by pulling her dress down, but I miscalculated just how poor the state of her dress was, and it just came off. </p><p>A problem … for the future. </p><p>I focused on the present, where my rock-hard shaft was locked between our bodies. I grabbed her hips and lifted her. “Slowly, I never…” she whispered with a sudden shyness. </p><p>I silenced her with a kiss, but I managed to clamp down on my burning arousal enough to slow down. Her reluctance would have been surprising — as Roman nobles were usually pretty hedonistic, with orgies treated as an acceptable social celebration — if she hadn’t already used a druidic ritual on me, showing their mixed cultural practices.  </p><p>Not that I was complaining. </p><p>We continued kissing as I pressed against her entrance, the tip slipping into her wetness. “Dance for me,” I whispered when I pulled for a desperate breath and continued kissing.  </p><p>The pleasure was incredible, but also the most uncomfortable. My body begged for me to push forward and take her, far stronger than I should be feeling even with her beauty. </p><p>It looked like I had some additional instincts I needed to deal with. </p><p>I knew I should have stopped, but as Lillian slowly pushed her hips down, devouring some of my length, that quickly turned impossible. Letting her pick the pace was all I was able to do to control those feelings, which soon turning into torture. </p><p>Luckily, Lillian was just as impatient. After a few gentle pushes, she suddenly pulled back with a beautiful, erotic smile on her face, and pushed her hips down, devouring me completely. </p><p>I kissed her desperately. Not to silence her — that was just a welcome side effect that kept us safe which I had forgotten momentarily — but to share my passion. Her hips danced up and down, each repeat driving my pleasure higher and higher. </p><p>The kiss was spectacular. </p><p>I had been determined to stay passive while letting her pick the pace, but that determination had been destroyed when Lillian pushed down again, taking my length fully. </p><p>“You have enough time to warm up, beautiful. Now, it’s my turn,” I whispered, my own voice feeling unrecognizable. A deep, desperate growl. </p><p>It made Lillian tighten even more. </p><p>I took another step, and trapped Lillian between my body and the wall, and started slamming inside her. Her moans would have brought the cave down if it wasn’t for my lips silencing her, they soon went into desperate wails. </p><p>Her hands landed on my shoulder, but rather than pushing me away, she pulled me even closer desperate. I shifted my hands to her hips, enjoying their incredible tautness while I also created better leverage. </p><p>I slammed inside her again and again, and soon, she started trembling, her wails turning into a listless yet erotic whimper. “Do you need me to stop?” I asked.  </p><p>“I-if you slow down, I will kill you,” she whispered. </p><p>“Well, who am I to refuse the orders of such an exalted noble —” I started to tease her, only for her to grab my hair and pull me into the kiss, not letting her lack of experience slow her down. I continued invading her with a merciless beat, exploring her depths.</p><p>It didn’t take long for her to regain her luster,  her hips moving passionately in an effort to let me join her. One of my hands traveled up, interjecting between our bodies as I finally grabbed her breast, sinking into its glorious depths. </p><p>“I've wanted to do that since I have seen you,” I whispered. </p><p>“While I — I tried to kill you,” she whispered. </p><p>I chuckled despite the overwhelming pleasure. “Well, not then, but soon after. Giving you that shirt was the hardest decision of my life.” </p><p>“Oh, true selflessness,” she whispered. “I think such chivalry deserves a reward.” </p><p>With that, she raised her hips before sinking down even more aggressively. Then again. And again…</p><p>Until I heard an explosion. I prepared to pull back, but just as I prepared, I felt some of my mana was following the movement of my seed. If I exploded out, we would get caught. Yet, it was too late to stop. I slammed inside her again, and filled her with not only my seed, but with my mana. </p><p>That triggered another climax. </p><p>“Was … that …” she stammered. </p><p>“No, not intentional. Another side effect. I’m sorry—” I started. </p><p>She kissed me again. “Don’t worry, I’m a healer. There won’t be any danger,” she whispered. I kept hugging her as we sat on the floor, still inside her. We both said nothing, then, she looked outside, where the sunlight was still coming in. “We can’t move until midnight, right?” she asked. </p><p>“Yes—” I said, only for her to push me down. </p><p>“Good. Then we can continue,” she whispered, and started riding me,  her beautiful tits dancing freely until I grabbed them… </p><p>I had to admit. Heroism had its benefits. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I was somewhat afraid as I looked out of the cave. While moving toward the tunnel, I had already realized that my eyes were more sensitive, which allowed me to see despite the low-light conditions. It had been useful … but I had hunted too many nocturnal beasts not to know that such sensitivity often came with a weakness for bright lights. </p><p>I put my head out of the cave, trying to prepare myself for a painful stab of pain as I squinted my eyes … but nothing. I opened my eyes fully, and there was no pain. The only thing that was out of the ordinary was how quickly my eyes had adapted to the brightness after staying in the caves. </p><p>Another benefit of my failed breakthrough. Combined with my obvious increase in physical power, it was not a bad consolation prize. </p><p>Too bad it came with too many side effects. </p><p>The most obvious one was the destruction of my elemental cores, drained into shivered husks unable to contain any vitae. With their state, I had no idea whether I could still reach the mage ranks, or that was forever impossible for me. </p><p>Of course, that implied that I could even survive more than a few days in the first place. After all, despite its name, a dragon heart wasn’t supposed to replace one’s heart ... Or so I believed. </p><p>Yet, I was alive, awake, and stronger than ever even with my elemental cores destroyed. I had far more mana in my body than I ever thought to be possible, and the dragon heart pumped more, power crawling under my skin. </p><p>The power that I didn’t dare to touch even bubbled under my skin, giving me an exhilarated feeling. Power that I didn’t imagine ever possessing … power that I had no way of using with my elemental cores useless other than discharging it. </p><p>The irony was fascinating. </p><p>“One day at a time, Marcus,” I muttered as I decided to ignore the fact that my heart had been taken over by the greatest mana treasure I had ever known, constantly giving me mana I couldn’t use, with unknown but potentially devastating side effects. </p><p>It already happened. There was no point in dwelling on something I couldn’t change. </p><p>I focused on observing my surroundings, trying to find a safe path. It was supposed to be a difficult challenge. With the battle between the third-order creatures and the mages still ongoing, the aftershocks were enough to displace the other creatures, turning the territory markers and the other indicators useless. And, with stealth our biggest advantage, we couldn’t risk fighting even a first-order beast. </p><p>It didn’t take long for me to realize just how well my senses had been increased. It wasn’t just my sight, but also my sense of smell, hearing … even touch, allowing me to catch even the slightest change of the wind. </p><p>It felt like someone had just given me a map marking the presence of every beast that was currently on the move. A hundred feet to the North, there was a snake coiled, waiting for a prey to stumble near it. Four hundred feet to the East, there was some kind of wild cat, moving toward the shore … and many more, some threats, some prey.</p><p>All visible. </p><p>I looked back into the cave, where Lillian was waiting for me. “Everything alright? You have been gone for a while.” </p><p>“Everything is perfect. I was getting used to my enhanced senses,” I said. She looked at me, worried, probably with similar concerns to what I had about possible drawbacks. “I can sense the location of the beasts easily. In some ways, it’s better than being a four-element mage.” </p><p>“Oh, really. I’ll try it the moment we find a dragon heart,” she said. “But no, it wouldn’t be fun to just replicate your method. How about if we come up with another brand new method that even a crazy old man would think of as risky…” </p><p>She continued complaining for a while, taking her frustration out of me. It was clearly not only about my mistake but the overall stress. I might have reacted badly if someone else tried to target me like that, but it was less than an hour ago that I had seen her facing an almost certain death trying to defend me from an army of earth moles. </p><p>That, and I could still see the wound in her hand, which was left from the blood magic that she had used on me, which was probably the only reason I managed to survive after that disaster. </p><p>Not a bad way to earn some forbearance. </p><p>I didn’t interrupt her, especially since even as her swears started to get rather pointed, she had enough presence of mind not to shout. While she did so, I paid attention to our surroundings, charting a safe path that would bring us to my first hiding spot. </p><p>At the same time, I was observing the battle between the mages and the creatures, their showy battle making their location clear enough that I could have pinpointed them without my recently upgraded senses. </p><p>The beasts were losing, which meant the battle was moving closer to the center of the island, and moving away from us. Waiting a while more would give us an even better chance to go unnoticed. So, I let her speak and curse without interruption. </p><p>I spoke only after she finished swearing. “Calmer?” </p><p>She blushed as she avoided my gaze. “I’m sorry. I don’t know what just came over me. I don’t usually…” </p><p>“Don’t worry about it. It’s just a side effect of the danger you’re facing.” </p><p>“I don’t know. You have risked your life more than I did, and came much closer to death. Yet, you’re still going strong while I’m a … mess.” </p><p>I chuckled. ”You have had more close calls with death since last evening than you had your whole life. It’s normal to feel a little frazzled. I’m more used to looking Pluton in the eye and refusing his call to visit his domain.” </p><p>She fell silent for a moment. “That’s it? Familiarity?” </p><p>I shrugged. “Not a method I would recommend, but certainly effective, especially when delivered by a crazy old man.” I paused for another second, checking the battle. “As much as I’m enjoying our talk, it’s a good time for us to start moving.” </p><p>She nodded. </p><p>“I want you to follow my orders, make no move, and unless a beast is a foot away from you, don’t use any mana without my signal. We can’t leave any track for them to follow, understand?” I said. </p><p>She nodded again. I taught her a few signals so we could communicate without speaking if necessary, and then our trek started. </p><p>As much as it was tempting to run toward the cave, I refused the temptation. Trekking without leaving any mark on our passage was slow, slower than walking even at a leisurely pace after the intense rain. We had to avoid mud and soft ground whenever possible by skipping over the rocks, and whenever we left a mark, I had to use a bundle of sticks to erase them. Several times, we had to take the longer routes to avoid the beasts I had detected, which added even more to our travel. </p><p>Traveling at least half of the distance by crawling on the ground behind outcroppings and bushes to prevent a random sailor from noticing us didn’t make our trek any easier. My enhanced senses proved useful there as well, allowing me to notice small things that I might have otherwise missed like a frayed piece of fabric, making it difficult for them to follow us even if they managed to track us through the underground tunnels that we had collapsed. </p><p>It was why I hadn’t laid any false tracks around the cave. That would have revealed our exit spot, making their search easier rather than harder. </p><p>It took nearly two hours, but we finally arrived at that cave. The area surrounding the cave was filled with footsteps, as well as the lingering effect of several elemental spells. Yet, rather than scaring me, those signs actually increased my confidence. </p><p>What better place to hide than one that had been already searched… </p><p>“Finally,” Lillian muttered once we entered the cave and I gave the all-clear signal we agreed before. “I can’t believe how tense it was just moving around. It was scarier than a battle.”</p><p>“It can be,” I answered. </p><p>“I can use water magic now, right?” she said.</p><p>“As long as you keep your presence low,” I said. She waved her hand, and water gathered around her for a quick shower, cleaning her body and her clothes at the same time. Convenient. I turned my back to give her some privacy. </p><p>I looked out of the elongated entrance, checking to make sure there was no motion. “You can turn back,” she said, and I did so… </p><p>Just when Lillian removed her shirt … well, my shirt that she borrowed. Underneath, she only had the scrapped remains of her own dress, nowhere near enough to hide her back. “Hey. Did you forget that I can see better in the dark,” I said, hating myself even as I reminded her of that and deprived myself of the incredible view that would have helped to pass the time until midnight. </p><p>Yet, she didn’t put back the shirt. Instead, she reached to the tattered remains of her dress, and with a flick, pushed it down. “I know,” she said with a sultry voice instead. “I remember promising you a reward if you survived…” </p><p>I knew that I should have refused. After my failed breakthrough, the state of my body was still doubtful, and the last thing I needed was to add a new variable. </p><p>Yet, as Lillian turned toward me, my blood started blowing faster, and I had just discovered another effect. </p><p>Arousal hit much harder … especially when I was trapped in a cave with a gorgeous blonde that had just offered the best present of my life. </p><p>I ignored everything I should be doing and walked toward her.</p>",

    "content": "<p>“How are we going to get out?” Lillian asked as she looked at the collapsed entrance. “I can probably cut through the rocks to reopen the entrance, but it would take too long. My kidnappers will catch up soon.” </p><p>“Probably,” I said. “The island is too small, and they are too professional to miss such an opportunity,” I said as I looked at the tunnel. They probably had scouts, already waiting. I performed shockingly well against the colony of moles, but a bunch of second-order beasts was completely different from a trained group of mages and soldiers. </p><p>And, even if they didn’t have any scouts, I doubted that the colony of earth moles was the only beasts that had been drawn to the commotion. They were simply the closest and the best equipped. If we tried to get out of the tunnel, we would be bogged down with the beasts, and eventually, the mages would catch up with us. </p><p>It was not a challenge I wanted to face. </p><p>There were too many elemental spell combinations that would negate my strength and speed advantage. It was not a confrontation I wanted, especially not before I could understand my changes after my breakthrough mishap. </p><p>My gaze turned toward the tunnels the earth moles had used to invade the cave, some large enough for a dog to walk comfortably. </p><p>Meaning, we could use them as long as we were on our knees. “How’re you with enclosed spaces,” I said even as I went to the tunnel, and peered in to make sure there was nothing. The cave was bright enough so I was able to see quite a distance, and there was no beast in sight. </p><p>“I don’t know…” she muttered, suddenly hesitant. “It’s too dark.” </p><p>“What are you talking about? We have excellent visibility —” I started before I froze. It was bright, too bright, but the shadows didn’t look the way they were supposed to. “Okay, I just found another effect from the failed breakthrough. I have a much better vision under limited lighting.” </p><p>That earned a gasp of her. That surprised me. Compared to my earlier display, better vision wasn’t exactly shocking. “What, a failed breakthrough?” she asked. </p><p>Her reaction made more sense in that context. “Of course. You can’t expect that I planned to absorb the dragon heart?” I said even as I crouched in front of the tunnel, only one dagger in hand. </p><p>That earned a growl of her. “How would I know? The only thing that you told me was that it was some kind of genius method from your grandfather that allowed you to make a breakthrough very quickly.” </p><p>I didn’t mind her complaining, as it was a good outlet for her stress. She had just another close call, and it was better for her to focus on her frustration than having an existential crisis in the middle of our escape. “Well, planning to absorb a dragon heart is crazy. No one would plan for that. It was an accident,” I explained. </p><p>“And, what was the plan?” </p><p>“I punctured my elemental cores at the same time, and mixed the elemental vitae,” I explained as I started crawling through the tunnel, with Lillian following behind, with a floating orb of water following her, glowing gently to illuminate our path. </p><p>She froze for a moment, and I looked back, watching her shocked expression. She smiled sardonically when she caught my gaze. “Oh, my bad. How dare I insult your sanity by daring to claim you tried to absorb a dragon heart intentionally. Mixing vitae forcefully is a perfectly sane method of breaking through, after all.” </p><p>“No need for sarcasm,” I said, feeling a smile spread on my face. </p><p>“I agree. You don’t deserve sarcasm. You deserve open insults for daring to even think that a method like that could work. You told me that your grandfather was confident about that method. How?” </p><p>I chuckled, feeling slightly hysteric even as we continued to move. Around us, I could hear the movement of the moles, which suggested that my hearing had improved as well. “Well, not exactly confident. He had warned that it was a very dangerous method, and it needed to be used only as a last resort.” </p><p>“Your grandfather warned you that it was very dangerous. The same man who decided that training a teenager with an intensity that would kill a team of experienced legionnaires was normal. He told you it was dangerous.” </p><p>“Well…” I muttered, feeling touched despite her anger. It had been a while since someone had worried about my well-being. </p><p>It was nice. </p><p>She growled. “We’ll talk about it very much once we’re safe.” </p><p>I suddenly felt mischievous. “Sure, dear. As long as we discussed the kiss as well.” </p><p>Her gasp was beautiful. I didn’t need to turn back to see her blushing, but I still did, catching her beautiful eyes widening shyly. “I don’t know what you are talking about,” she said.</p><p>“Oh, really —” I started, before I felt an unwelcome distraction. The sound of a beast, digging a tunnel toward us. It didn’t make much noise. Without my enhanced hearing, it would have been a nasty ambush. With it, it had an easy solution. “Cast a water blade here,” I said as I pointed where the beast would burst out.</p><p>She looked surprised at the sudden order, but she still cast the spell. She trusted me unconditionally, at least when it came to fighting. I had a feeling that she wouldn’t trust me easily when it came to elemental theory. </p><p>“Good work,” I said as the water blade cut through the dirt and killed the beast preparing to ambush. “Now, about what we were talking about —” </p><p>“We can talk about it later,” she said, her blush back. “Now, focus on the moles, and stop speaking.” </p><p>I was tempted to tease her more, but she was right. The moles might have been scared after I had massacred a portion of their colony, but they might change their mind if we drift too close to their living space. </p><p>I closed my eyes, focusing on my hearing as I tried to listen to their movements, trying to understand the direction of their voice. It was not easy, as the sound spread and echoed weirdly in tight and elongated enclosed tunnels. My job would have been much easier if I could actually feel their magical presence. </p><p>But, with my elemental cores temporary — at least that was what I had been hoping — useless, I couldn’t use my many methods of detection. As a water mage, Lillian couldn’t either, at least not without using enough mana to bridge the gap, shouting our location to our enemies. </p><p>That limitation slowed our journey somewhat, and added several false turns. Collapsing the tunnels behind us took even more time. Still, after almost an hour of crawling, and several false turns, we finally reached the surface, which was a small cave near the shore, one of many emergency exits of the mole colony. </p><p>Outside, some distance away, near our cave I could see the beasts of the island and the mages battling. Not very well, as there were too many objects on the way to catch a glimpse of the fighters. I could only see the spells themselves. </p><p>“Excellent. We’re safe … well, safeish,” I said as I watched Lillian walk out. “A little more luck, and we might actually get away from this godforsaken island safely.” </p><p>“Safe,” she muttered as she stood up, her tone wistful. I could see that her face was trembling, which was a beautiful reaction. “What exactly are we going to do?” </p><p>“First, we need to find a better location to hide, and wait for the darkness.” </p><p>She looked toward the center of the island, and the battle that was ongoing in between. “Isn’t it dangerous with the battle going on?” she asked. </p><p>“It would have been, if we were going there,” I explained. </p><p>“Where are we going, then?” she asked, her eyes widening when I pointed toward the cove where they had their ships moored. “You’re mad.” </p><p>“That’s actually our best option,” I said. “Once the battle ends, they will continue their search…” </p><p>“You’re betting that they will go deeper into the island rather than searching the shore again.” </p><p>“They don’t have any other choice, not with the beast stampede going on,” I said. “And, meanwhile, we’ll go to the cave we first met.” </p><p>“Really, why there?” she asked. </p><p>“Because, with the obvious signs of battle, it’s one-stop they had certainly searched, making it the likeliest place to avoid them until dusk. Not to mention, it’s close enough to their ships that we could make a move.</p><p>“Wouldn’t it be safer to just stay and hope we can avoid them?” </p><p>“No. We still don’t know who they are, and how determined they are to find you,” I said. “And, I don’t know how long I could keep my mana contained. Sooner or later, it’ll flare, and I much rather be in the vast wilderness of Gaul than locked in a tiny island with three ships worth of enemies searching for me. </p><p>“It still feels weird, trying to hide so close to their ships.” </p><p>“Sometimes, the shadow of a hunter is the best spot for a prey to hide.”</p>",

    "content": "<p>Emily’s lips were just wrapping around my girth when the waitress had returned with our drinks, and looked around. “Oh, your date is gone already?” she asked, her tone seductive as her hips started to dance even more. She looked beautiful with her curves stuffed in already-revealing exercise clothing that was purchased by someone leaner. </p><p>“Just visiting the bathroom,” I said. </p><p>“Oh, a pity,” she said, neither her tone nor her expression agreeing with the sentiment. I just chuckled, which was a good way to hide my reaction to pleasure. Emily’s head started to bob the moment she heard Eva’s voice. </p><p>“Not much. I’m sure she’ll return soon,” I said. </p><p>Eva walked closer, but once she put her drinks down, her hand landed on my thigh rubbing it softly, unaware of what she would have touched if she went just a few inches more to and pushed the tablecloth away. </p><p>However, with the tablecloth hanging between my legs, Emily saw where she had been touching. It might have been a problem if it wasn’t for our agreement that I would ‘punish’ her, but now, it merely made Emily bob her head faster. </p><p>“How about I help you keep … entertained until her return,” she said, then she noticed Emily’s phone, still on the table. She reached to her phone immediately and typed a message. She tried to keep it hidden, but with my power, it failed. It was a text to someone, likely to her coworker, asking her to block the entrance of the ladies' room for a few minutes, excuse it a mechanical malfunction. </p><p>Quick thinking. It also reminded me just how nasty women could be against each other once properly motivated, reminding me that I needed to be careful with my growing web of supers that I seduced. </p><p>“Well, it depends on how you keep me entertained,” I said even as I grabbed her ass. “You need to work hard to prevent me from going to the bathroom and visit her instead. </p><p>Eva’s eyes tightened just as her fingers tightened on my thigh. Yet, she stayed in place even as I squeezed her ass. Whatever memory that triggered her anger must have been spectacular for her to act like this. </p><p>“Well, I have to…” she said, unable to prevent a vicious edge from slipping into her tone as she rubbed my leg. “After all, we can’t allow our customers to get bored,” she added, though as she spoke, her voice weakened while a blush spread. She was no doubt realizing the absurdity of her words. </p><p>I gave her a confident grin, which made her quiver with excitement and fear in equal amounts. She tried to cover up her reaction by reaching for my drink and taking a sip, but she was nowhere near as successful as she might think. I grabbed her waist, and pulled her on the table, her legs dangling down in a way that Emily could see. </p><p>Emily must have enjoyed that, because her fingers fingers joined the game, cupping my balls for a gentle massage while she pushed herself down even deeper. </p><p>“Now, let’s see if you have what it takes to keep me entertained,” I said with a throaty tone that was working wonders on Eva to establish her mood. She was reacting to the bad boy persona very well. </p><p>She blushed as she tried to say something, but that staggered for a moment as I put my hand on her leg. “I …” she started, which turned to a gulp as I continued climbing up. Soon, I was touching her shorts, but that didn’t help her any. The elastic of her shorts was already thin enough before they had been stretched to the limit. </p><p>“What’s wrong, sweetie? Cat got your tongue? I thought that you were supposed to keep me entertained while my date is away. It’s hard to do that without talking, is it?” I said, but I could see her hesitation. The situation had escalated further than she expected, and she was having second thoughts. “Speaking of my date, I wonder just how long she’ll stay there. She was supposed to return,” I added. </p><p>That mention was not pointless. After all, she was still under the impression that she was the one who arranged Emily’s absence once she noticed she had left her phone back. A ticking clock that she had introduced, unaware that it became a tool to goad her to further action. </p><p>“Well, not necessarily,” she whispered, once again her vicious tone enough to suppress her shyness. </p><p>“Hmm, what an intriguing statement,” I said even as I let my fingers climb up, landing right at the center of her legs, where her lack of underwear was paying incredible dividends. Her growing arousal was spreading to her thin shorts, leaving irrevocable evidence of her growing desire. </p><p>I put my finger against her wetness. Two of my fingers landed on her entrance, while my thumb found her clit. A little aggressive for foreplay, but considering the constraints we had been operating, it was necessary. </p><p>Her eyes widened as my hand assailed her wetness in an aggression she was nowhere near prepared for. Lost in pleasure, she fisted the tablecloth aggressively as she moaned. </p><p>It was good that Eva was distracted, because it allowed me to slip my hand under the tablecloth without raising any kind of issue as I grabbed Emily’s beautiful hair … and started facefucking her, an escalation my naughty tech heroine was more than enthusiastic about. </p><p>She tried to keep her gagging down, but she wasn’t entirely successful. Luckily, Eva had her own concerns, such as containing her moans to register it. </p><p>“Show me your tits if you want to continue,” I ordered her. A daring, rough order, not my usual style, but, I didn’t forget that, as much as playing with a naughty musician with some really weird mental hangups was fun, it was truly about Emily. And, she would appreciate that humiliation. </p><p>Eva followed my order immediately and pushed her top up, the pleasure momentarily making her forget her exact location. A concealed corner it might be, it was still a public cafe, where any coworker or customer stumble upon the sight of her naked breasts. </p><p>Her incredibly beautiful breasts which defied gravity, instead shook as she started to tremble. I could sense that her climax was not too far away, the location enough to overwhelm her concerns. </p><p>“Now, play with your tits,” I ordered even as I pulled her bottom down enough to reveal her naked pussy, and slipped two fingers inside. </p><p>“I —” she started, which was all she was able to say as I started fingering her mercilessly, each second driving her deeper into the pleasure. “Impressive. I have to admit, you are fulfilling that promise to keep me entertained,” I said. </p><p>I didn’t push for more for a simple reason. Emily’s lips were still around my shaft, giving me the best blowjob she was responsible to date. </p><p>Then, Emily’s hand appeared under the tablecloth. For a moment, I thought that she had been asking for a reprieve, but then, she mimed taking photos — not very accurately, considering she was still busy with my cock in her throat, forcing me to rely on my power to understand it. </p><p>Naughty. I stopped holding her hair, and instead grabbed her phone off the table and passed it to her. </p><p>Then, I grabbed my own phone with the same hand, and took several photos of Eva, who, at this point, collapsed on the table. “P-pictures?” Eva whispered. </p><p>“Come on, sweetie. A nude is nowhere as bad as laying on your back on a random table at your workplace,” I said to her. She might have reacted negatively to it, but as I fingered her furiously, her reaction was just tightening around my fingers as she climaxed. </p><p>I took a lot of photos, each going to Emily, who responded by sucking me even more aggressively, so I summed up not too much after Eva. “Give me your number. I’ll send them to you,” I said. Eva, too dazed after her climax, rattled her number, giving me a way to maintain contact with her. </p><p>Was having her number necessary? No. </p><p>Did I want it still? Definitely.</p><p>“I … I need to go change,” she stammered as she regained her wits and pushed herself off the table, fixing her clothing to regain her modesty, which, considering her clothing, didn’t help much. Her bottom got even more transparent, and her top was not capable of hiding her hardened nipples. </p><p>Emily appeared from under the table before Eva could disappear, but luckily, Eva was too concerned about being seen by others before she could go back to an employee-only section and didn’t look back. </p><p>My sexy tech support watched her leave even as she licked her lips. “Well, that was—” she started, which I interrupted by my fingers into her mouth, still wet with Eva’s juices. </p><p>“Lick,” I ordered, and Emily did so, treating it as a part of her reward. Incredibly sexy, and it also allowed me to test her attitude toward some future fun. Incredible. </p><p>I teased her a bit more until she sat down. However, this time, I didn’t start playing footsie. </p><p>It was the perfect time to make her an offer she couldn’t refuse. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Hello, sir. It’s time to order,” the waitress said with a raspy voice that was surprisingly flawless. I had a feeling it was less about her seduction experience, and more about her skills as a musician. </p><p>Emily looked at me in shock, silently begging me not to abandon her, showing the extent of her fragility. I could see that, as she sat on her comfortable chair, her shoulders slouching, she didn’t know how to handle a direct provocation. </p><p>Once again, I was glad for my power. If it hadn’t allowed me to read the extent of her insecurities, I might have decided to flirt with the waitress to make her jealous, ruining all of our progress. However, I could also see that it was not jealousy. </p><p>She was afraid of being replaced. All I needed was to flirt with the waitress to give that impression … and I couldn’t imagine how she would react if I actually left. Of course, her reactions were explosive, because she was currently under a process of transformation. And, just like a beautiful butterfly, she was most vulnerable while leaving her silk cocoon. </p><p>In that metaphor, I was the spider that was content tying her to me with my web rather than devouring her immediately. I wondered if it was her fortune or misfortune. </p><p>Either way, as I turned to order, I had a challenge in front of me. I had convinced Emily that she was not under any kind of risk. Meanwhile, I needed to give my vengeful waitress enough to convince her that she was succeeding in her misplaced act of revenge. </p><p>Well, I didn’t have to, except for my self-appointed challenge. However, it was a good way to practice certain things, both in terms of reading people, and manipulating the more complex situations to my benefit. </p><p>I needed to see what worked, and what did not in such a low-stakes environment. </p><p>“Well, we’ll have a light dinner. Let’s start with a cheese platter, and some fresh juices,” I said, then went for some specific selection, enough to show I knew exactly what I was talking about. The cafe didn’t have any alcohol, and I wasn’t willing to order a second-rate drink in the first place. I had always been a tad obsessive about my drinks, and my power didn’t help. </p><p>It was a pity events prevented me from focusing on that part of my career. </p><p>“Oh, what an interesting choice. You’re a real gourmet, are you?” she said in a flirty manner. I smiled and winked, which would have been enough to send Emily deep into a personal crisis if it wasn’t for one important fact.</p><p>I had removed my shoe in preparation, and chose to bring my foot, rubbing against her inner thigh, both to distract her so she missed my wink, and to remind her I was here on a date with her, and a slutty waitress wasn’t enough to make me forget her. </p><p>Emily wore a smile at first, which immediately turned into a panicked one as I pushed it far more than a game of footsie had gone, particularly at the beginning. My toe landed directly on her panties, which were wet with arousal. </p><p>As my toe draw small circles around her clit, her face twisted with pleasure. The waitress looked at Emily, but her smug smile suggested that she had misread her expression significantly. Particularly after Emily avoided eye contact and looked down. </p><p>She might be an exhibitionist, but what we were doing was a bit out of her comfort zone. She still enjoyed it, but she was unable to weaponize it like the earlier show. </p><p>“Well, I try …” I said, then let my voice linger. </p><p>“Eva,” she completed. </p><p>“Interesting name,” I said, which was a pretty neutral comment, at least from the perspective of Emily, who had just closed her eyes to process the jolt of pleasure. For Eva, whose fingers were gently taken into my hand before delivering a seductive kiss to the back of her hand, it was far more suggestive. </p><p>She reacted to the kiss on her hand even better than I expected. “T-thanks, sir,” she whispered, her tone getting a hint of exaggerated formality that I only caught thanks to my power, highly suggesting that, while growing up as an ugly duckling, she had been a fan of regency romances. </p><p>It was fun to pull little nuggets about people from the air. Almost as fun as flirting with two sexy girls at the same time. </p><p>“So, I’m guessing you're a musician,” I said even as I kept holding Eva’s hand, my finger caressing the subtle callouses in her fingers. “Cello?” I guessed, knowing that it was wrong. I kept holding her hand, my fingers intertwined with her. </p><p>“Violin, but close enough,” she said as she leaned forward, giving me a deeper glimpse of her cleavage, then threw a smug smile toward Emily, misreading the reason for her tense expression. “You’re surprisingly intellectual for…” she said, then nodded toward Emily. </p><p>“Well, I try,” I said as I pulled her hand down slowly, which landed on my right thigh, one that wasn’t moving rhythmically to keep Emily distracted. Eva’s blush was spectacular, reinforcing that she wasn’t exactly a vixen, just a little rabbit trying to be one. </p><p>The proof, was just how quickly her expression shattered when I dragged her fingers to my crotch, and her fingertips touched my cock. “I … I better go and bring the orders,” she stammered and dashed away, her tone enough to make Emily look. </p><p>“W-what was that?” Emily asked, shocked. </p><p>“Don’t tell me you’re afraid that you have been noticed? You weren’t that concerned when you were putting on a show earlier.” </p><p>“I … of course not,” she said, quick to defend herself. And, at the same time, forgetting that, while she had been putting on that show, I was supposed to be unaware of it. Nothing like a combination of arousal, pleasure, and shame to manipulate such small details. </p><p>“Then, are you unhappy that I helped you to tease her?” </p><p>“Well…” Emily muttered, blushing even more as she squirmed; not helped by the fact that my foot was still between her legs, teasing her over her drenched panties. She tried to maintain eye contact, but failed against my smug smile. “Not exactly unhappy…” </p><p>“But you wanted to destroy that uppity bitch yourself,” I completed. </p><p>“Not the words I would use,” Emily said. </p><p>“But, the intent is the same, right?” I said as I opened my phone, and showed the picture of the sexy heroine that she snapped. “Don’t try to tell me that this was an accident.” </p><p>Her blush turned into an even deeper color, so I pulled my foot back. “I know it was wrong, but I can explain —” she whispered. </p><p>I grabbed her hand and squeezed gently. “There’s nothing to explain. I’m sure she’s one of the bullies that’s targeting you in the workplace, and you decided to take some revenge. Don’t worry, it’s not like you revealed it publicly. You just punished her appropriately for her disrespect, but no one got hurt.” My whispers validated her behavior, just like a devil trying to tempt an innocent angel. </p><p>Well, not so innocent with that blouse. I could see everything as she leaned against the table. </p><p>A bulky table, perfect for some escalation. </p><p>“Y-you’re right,” she whispered. “She deserved it. I was just…” </p><p>“Exactly. You’re smart, beautiful, and capable. It’s their fault treating you like this,” I said. My foot went back in place as I started whispering sweet words of corruption, which she accepted easily, her emotional fragility and her sexual gratification making an excellent combination. </p><p>She tried to maintain eye contact. She succeeded, but not easily. </p><p>“Well, I have an idea to punish her even more,” I said. Her eyes brightened, showing that she was ready to hear. “Do you want to see just how far she’s willing to go to get back at you?” I asked. </p><p>“D-depends,” she whispered, intrigued yet shy.</p><p>“I’ll do my best to punish her, with one condition,” I said. </p><p>“What do I need to do?” she asked. </p><p>I tapped the bulky table, where the tablecloth hid most, even as I caught her gaze, enjoying her hesitant expression. “You’re going to stay under the table, and keep me motivated, of course.” </p><p>“I — I,” she stammered as the offer came. “I-in public.” </p><p>“We don’t have to do if you can’t handle her —” I started, knowing that she wouldn’t miss such an obvious challenge. </p><p>Her smile flashed even as she interrupted with a soft kick under the table, unable to handle the insulation that she couldn’t handle the waitress who had just challenged her. Perfect. “I can handle it, of course,” she said, her anger making her conveniently ignore some obvious questions like how going under the table to provide me with some entertainment helped her to get back with her rival. </p><p>“Show me, then,” I escalated. </p><p>She slipped under the table. </p><p></p>",

    "content": "<p>Charlie tried to catch Umi’s gaze as she stood up to take her seat once more. He succeeded for a moment. “T-try to p-play along,” he said. “The game is almost over.” </p><p>Umi gave him a dismissive nod, not even bothering to look at him, her gaze firmly on Tiffany, whose success had annoyed her immensely. It didn’t surprise me. Charlie wasn’t doing particularly well in the respect department earlier, but his actions during the game had ruined any hope she might have for the aim. </p><p>Instead, she sat on my lap, and started rocking wildly, but this time, she didn’t pull her skirt up. </p><p>I didn’t ask her to. It didn’t matter, when Tiffany readily ruined our fun whenever things started to escalate. Of course, I could have asked Tiffany to stop doing that, but watching their petty argument was entertaining enough. </p><p>Also, as amusing as it had been taking their wives while they had been distracted with their effort to earn my favor, the poker game was getting stale. At this point, they were too drunk for it to be entertaining. </p><p>So, I started playing the game more seriously. Even if they weren’t drunk and the dealer wasn’t cheating in my favor, I would have won easily, but with those factors in, I managed to conceal my victory in a couple of wild hands, earning back what I put in, and even won ten thousand from them, leaving them looking at the table with gaping expression. </p><p>“I think that’s all for me,” I said as I stood up, though I made a show of stumbling. “Everything is getting blurry,” I added, then looked at their chips. “But don’t interrupt your fun for me,” I said. </p><p>“Actually, we—” Mark started, but I continued talking. A benefit of acting drunk. </p><p>“Since you two entertained me this much, let me add something to sweeten the pot. I’ll give the winner the right to take a sales region from the loser.” With that, I started walking toward the bathroom. </p><p>“Actually, I will go visit the kitchen, we need more drinks,” Umi said, which was objectively not true. My bottle was almost finished, but with most of it poured into the fake potted plant, I didn’t need to replenish it. Mark and Charlie still had some in their bottles, but they were in no condition to continue it. </p><p>However, Charlie just nodded absentmindedly, too focused on recovering their losses. </p><p>Tiffany, who had put some of her clothing back on in the process, looked at Umi. “Maybe you should deal the cards while I find them. It might be hard to find them,” she said. </p><p>“No need. I can handle it,” Umi said, a naughty smile blooming on her face as she walked faster, thinking that she won in their game of ‘Musical chairs - Naughty edition’, not realizing Tiffany was just goading her. </p><p>Umi accompanied me to the end of the corridor, trying to look calm, but the moment we reached the end of the corridor, she pressed her finger against my lips and grabbed my wrist. “Follow me,” she said, trying to sound authoritative, which was only as successful as a beautiful fluffy kitten trying to look threatening after watching a documentary about lions.  </p><p>And, just as adorable. </p><p>Amused by her attempt, I followed her, even when she dragged me toward the back entrance to the garden, gesturing to me to be silent. </p><p>I followed her as she opened the door, and we found ourselves in a well-maintained garden. “So,” I whispered. “Are you in the mood for some open-air fun?” </p><p>“No, we’re going to my apartment,” she said. “Tiffany had all the fun she needed. For the rest of the night, she can deal with two drunks.” </p><p>Who was I to refuse such a beautiful offer, at least in terms of leaving the place? I wasn’t as sure about visiting her apartment, but that part, we could negotiate later. </p><p>It took a while for us to circle around the house, mostly because I chose to steal a few kisses while we sneaked around. However, once we arrived at the car, I noticed a surprise. A large blanket in the back seat. One that wasn’t here before. </p><p>Excited by her ‘successful’ escape, Umi missed that. I was curious just how long it would take for her to notice it. “Why don’t you drive while I closed my eyes for a while,” I asked her even as I went to sit in the backseat. “Also, drive to my house,” I said, not wanting to stuff myself into her tiny bed, which might be enough for two people, but I suspected we would need more.   </p><p>“Yes, sir,” Umi said as I settled in the backseat, and turned off the internal lights. The backseat wasn’t pitch black, but it was dark enough. So, Umi didn’t notice that, once I sat down, the blanket moved slightly, but I was able to see the red strands of hair slipping out. </p><p>I wondered just how long it would take for Umi to realize her sneaky escape attempt wasn’t as successful. </p><p>Once her head was safely blocked by the seat, Tiffany let the blanket slip just enough to reveal her face. She looked up, biting her lip before glancing down at my growing bulge, her expression naughty. I chuckled even as I freed my shaft, happy to play along once again. </p><p>Tiffany’s intention was clear. Umi tried to sneak around, and Tiffany was teaching her how it was done. I didn’t know what she said to disappear from the house, nor did I care other than a momentary curiosity. </p><p>“Do you mind turning on the music, sweetie,” I asked Umi. </p><p>“Yes, sir,” she accepted readily, her smile beautiful as she rode the high of her success, unaware that Tiffany had countered her ploy beautifully. Her lips were already around my cock, bobbing her head enthusiastically, trusting the combined effect of the music and engine sound to keep her rumbling moans hidden. </p><p>Umi didn’t notice it. The relative darkness and the seat blocking her view were two smaller reasons, but the real reason was her driving. She wasn’t a bad driver. On the contrary, she was a very good driver, and a very careful one. </p><p>It worked against her right now. As she focused on the road, she missed the occasional movement of the blanket, just as she failed to register its presence. After a few minutes, Tiffany looked at me, a naughty smile on her face as she prepared to escalate. </p><p>Luckily, the beautiful imported sedan I used had a lot of legroom for comfort by design. Coupled with the fact that Umi wasn’t the tallest driver, so pulled the seat forward quite a bit, there was enough space for Tiffany to shift there. </p><p>She did so while the car was moving. Umi didn’t notice. I certainly did, particularly since, as the blanket slid off, Tiffany revealed that her presence wasn’t the only surprise. </p><p>She wasn’t even wearing a stitch. </p><p>Naughty, I thought even as I watched Tiffany’s naked body get between me and the seat, her naked beauty particularly alluring as we hid from Umi. It added to our fun. </p><p>It was already entertaining enough, then Tiffany reached under the blanket, and pulled out her phone. She typed a quick message, but her head continued bobbing. I didn’t try to read who she texted, but a second later, Umi’s phone, which she was using as a GPS device, had a little message notification, solving that particular mystery. </p><p>Umi smirked when she saw the notification, but she only sent a message when we stopped for a red light — which she didn’t pass despite the road being empty at this hour. They texted quite a bit. I didn’t have any problems with it, considering that, unlike Umi, Tiffany had no trouble multitasking.  </p><p>Though, comparing them wasn’t fair. Unlike texting and driving, there never had been a campaign against texting and sucking. </p><p>Or, deep-throating.  </p><p>“Who were you texting?” I asked. </p><p>“Tiffany,” Umi answered smugly. “She is wondering where we are.” </p><p>“And, what did you say?” </p><p>“I told her that she might have been lucky during the game, but mere luck couldn’t win against strategic thinking and preparation.” </p><p>“That’s certainly true. Strategic thinking and guile deserve a reward,” I said even as I grabbed Tiffany’s hair and pushed her down even more, invading her throat. Umi smiled, thinking that it was a compliment she earned. </p><p>With no traffic, the drive didn’t last particularly long. Soon, we were at my garage. Umi stepped out to open my door, even after everything, willing to prove that she was an excellent secretary.  </p><p>I admired her commitment to perfection. Most secretaries, after everything we had done, would have assumed that their real job description was optional. Umi seemed to be a perfectionist enough to pick another direction. </p><p>Fascinating. </p><p>Too bad her diligence wasn’t rewarded. When she opened the door,  she was met with a surprise. Tiffany, wearing nothing, doing her best to suffocate herself with my girth. </p><p>Umi gasped as I let Tiffany pull back. “W-why are you here?” Umi gasped in shock. </p><p>“Oh, sweetie. You are right in saying that mere luck couldn’t win against strategic thinking and preparation,” Tiffany said as she stepped out of the car, standing in front of Umi in her full glory.  “Too bad I’m better than you at that as well…” </p>",

    "content": "<p>I was whistling happily as I buried the formation stones around the valley. It was far more fun to set up formations without carefully calculating every scrap of Qi that needed to be spent to attain maximum efficiency. </p><p>Yesterday, I had to be very careful, as I had been wasting my subdued Qi, which could be the distinction between survival and death in case of an emergency. Meanwhile, spirit stones had no value for me. </p><p>Even the ones that were shaped like small bricks, holding a hundred strands of Qi comfortably. I had exactly a hundred and twenty-five of those incredible stones, enough to see up a far better formation around. I started with establishing a new core layer around the valley. The previous formation I had set up was established without a proper foundation, which was solved by the bounty that Aisnam had brought to me. </p><p>The core layer alone consumed ten of the System-provided spirit stones. A significant expense. </p><p>Technically, I could have attained the same effectiveness with half the cost, but I also wanted to keep the core open for further improvements. After all, unlike other formation masters, my skill level had been improving every day. Meaning, that every time I returned, I would need to make some serious changes in the formation. </p><p>Once the core formation was complete, I quickly drew fifty flame talismans, each at Yellow Peak Grade — the improvements in my Talisman skill were paying excellent dividends — and embedded them into formation. It was the easiest way for me to add an offensive method. It was expensive and one-use, but those constraints worked for my purposes. </p><p>With that, Pearyin was safe. </p><p>My next focus was the illusion formation, a tricky product that would lead any savage beast that was caught in a cave to die, while leading any human that stumbled away without them even realizing. It was a tricky construct, but made easier by the fact that I wasn’t trying to target cultivators. </p><p>The next formation was a supportive one, turning the dead beasts into fertilizer and feeding it to the plants, which would help them maintain their peak condition. Once that was done, my next aim was to populate all seven hills with spirit plants. </p><p>I first pulled the plants I had uprooted from the cave, only to freeze. All six plants were dead. “They should be able to last for a month, easily,” I muttered, wondering how I failed despite my spirit plant skill, but as I thought about it, I failed to come up with any. </p><p>“Maybe the problem is not my skill,” I said as I uprooted an ordinary plant and put it into my storage ring, and pulled it back out. </p><p>It came out dead. </p><p>“Alright, it’s a good way to learn,” I said as I quickly chopped the six dead plants. Then, I turned them into fertilizer and started working on the rest of the hills. Even with my skills and my cultivation-enhanced working speed, once I finished setting up formations on all seven hills, the evening wasn’t too far away. </p><p>Another day, gone just like that, but not wasted. I looked at the formation that covered the seven hills and the valley proudly, its interlocked structure making it much harder. Too bad it had cost me half of my spirit stones, but at least all the seeds I had turned into sprouts capable of producing a significant amount of Qi. </p><p>It should be enough to fulfill Pearyin’s needs, at least for a long while. If and when it stopped being enough … Well, that was a thought for the future. After all, my ability to deal with problems was growing just like her need for Qi was growing. </p><p>My loss was not guaranteed. </p><p>“Still, it’s a beautiful work of art,” I said as I looked at the formation. My skills might come from the System, but unlike the talismans, which was pretty much a rote repetition, the design of the formation was my own work. </p><p>I was proud of it. </p><p>Once everything was completed, I walked back into the valley, the new formation parting open in front of me. “Wow, beautiful,” I said as I looked around, and it was not an exaggeration. During the early morning, the valley was still a wild corner. However, in less than a day, it had turned into a beautiful holiday spot that a billionaire would claim for himself happily. </p><p>At the center of the valley, there were two cottages. One for her elusive master with the name plaque as I requested, and another cute cottage for her. Around the two cottages, the weeds and bushes had been dealt with. A few more colorful plants had remained, but she had carefully pruned them to make them look more domesticated. </p><p>A small distance away from the cottages, there was a spring, but she dug a small canal to connect it to a small pool. It was not large enough to swim, so it was probably a bath. </p><p>Pearyin immediately moved there. “Do you want to have a bath, sir?” she asked, her blush beautiful. </p><p>“Tempting, but not now,” I answered. “I still need to address a few things, but I promise I’ll test it during my next visit.” </p><p>She nodded, though I could see that she was disappointed. Well, I was as well, but I didn’t want to neglect capital with everything going on. With the siege of the palace, everything was a powder keg. </p><p>“Before leaving, I want to test your aptitude, come here,” I said. She nodded, and I started giving her another crash course on various concepts, wanting to see if there was a change. </p><p>Her comprehension had gone through a general improvement, and she was able to learn every topic I was teaching her several times faster than I thought was possible. Even a hundred times learning capability meant she needed months of dedicated study to surpass Perfection. </p><p>Of course, for a cultivator that could live for more than a hundred years, such a speed was more than enough. Just by having their talisman crafting skill at Perfection, they would live a life of comfort. A good deal for many. </p><p>Unfortunately, it was not exactly worthwhile for my purposes. Due to my System, I improved far faster… </p><p>And, due to the unique brand of luck I had been dealing with, I had to improve faster. </p><p>So, I didn’t ask her to learn anything other than the fundamentals of each skill … with one exception. The combat skills. </p><p>Well, the combat skill, considering Verdant Palm was still the only proper cultivation combat technique I knew. It was a beginner technique, which meant she could improve better. “Don’t forget,” I reiterated after I taught her all the stances. “This technique belongs to a cultivation family, so you can only reveal it to others as a last resort.” </p><p>“I understand, sir,” she said, nodding seriously. </p><p>“Good, start practicing while I draw some talismans. I’ll correct your mistakes when I finish with them,” I said, and sent her away before I started drawing two sets of talismans. For one set, I deliberately reduced their quality, as they would be delivered to Aisnam. Even with her contacts, I didn’t need her alerting others by trying to sell Yellow Peak-Grade talismans. </p><p>The ones for Pearyin’s personal use, I drew strongly. </p><p>I drew talismans for almost an hour, focused on my work, until I was interrupted by a sudden glow. A sudden, familiar glow… </p><p>Surprised, I went to the source, only to see Pearyin covered with an intense white glow. </p><p>The telltale sign of a skill breakthrough. However, as the glow fell on me, I suddenly gained some inspiration on how to improve my Verdant Palm if I started practicing now, but I ignored it and focused on Pearyin’s panic. </p><p>I had much better methods to improve. </p><p>“S-sir, what’s going on?” she asked. </p><p>“Don’t worry, it’s just a skill breakthrough,” I said, trying to hide my shock. “Why don’t you show me your palm skills.” </p><p>She went through the katas, and I watched her, unable to suppress my shock. Her movements were incredible, far smoother and sublime than what I was capable of — understandable, as I didn’t ask for any lessons in her palm technique since Aisnam’s recovery, prioritizing other skills, letting it lag behind others — confirming that her compression was not similar for all techniques. </p><p>I wondered if her aptitude was for cultivation combat techniques in general, or only for palm techniques. Based on my limited understanding, both were possibilities. </p><p>Either way, I didn’t have any other cultivation combat technique to test, so it needed to stay a mystery until I could solve that particular mystery. </p><p>“Incredible work, sweetie,” I said as I invited her for a hug. “Continue practicing, but stop once another glow appears,“ I ordered. That part was more of a precaution than anything. </p><p>I didn’t know just how big of a commotion the stage after Immersion would create, and I didn’t want to test it in such a volatile location. </p><p>After her breakthrough, I stayed with her several minutes longer than I had planned, making sure she was calmer before leaving. I might have even considered staying with her. </p><p>But, after I had taken the book about formations away, the Tiger Fist army was getting more and more aggressive. And, I preferred to stay near Aisnam as much as possible to intervene if necessary. </p><p>It was only a matter of time until an explosion.</p>",

One was my new sword in an ordinary sheathe to hide its extraordinary nature, and the other was a large bag, filled with jade stones for laying down formations, and talisman papers. </p><p>Two objects I needed the most, giving me confidence that I could improve the formation I had created for Pearyin significantly. As usual, I went to a cave before activating the rewards I had received, sublimating the lessons I had received. </p><p>The feeling of constant improvement was fascinating. </p><p>“If only I received more spirit stones as a reward,” I muttered. Pearyin gifted me a hundred spirit stones, which would be enough to jump-start a second garden back at the formation. Unfortunately, I couldn’t use them without making her suspicious about their sudden disappearance. </p><p>So, I had to rely on the reward. I decided to pull one of them from my Inventory, to see what the difference was. However, the moment I reached it, a large rock, similar to a small brick appeared in my hand, containing a hundred strands. </p><p>“Alright, now I see why the return was like that,” I said with a big smile, happy with the way System paid back even as I put the spirit stone into my storage ring. A hundred and twenty spirit stones of that size meant more than ten thousand strands of Qi. </p><p>More than enough to establish the formation and serve Pearyin’s needs at the same time. </p><p>I thought about reaching into my inventory and pulling the other sword, but I decided to delay it. Yellow Grade artifacts were enough for the cultivators to massacre each other, I didn’t want to tempt fate with a Black Grade sword unless I had no choice. </p><p>I had the storage ring, but treating it as absolutely safe was a dangerous assumption. It was much better to keep it in my Inventory as a trump card, if I faced a threat I couldn’t deal with two Profound Peak artifacts, and hundreds of Yellow Grade talismans that I could create thanks to my new paper delivery. </p><p>With everything done, I went to Pearyin’s cave. She was meditating. “Good morning, sweetie,” I greeted her. </p><p>“Good morning, master,” she answered as she stopped meditating, and stood up to give a traditional curtsy. </p><p>“Start gathering your stuff, we’re going back to Markas,” I said. </p><p>I expected a comment or a question, but she just nodded before she started packing her very limited personal effects. I shook my head. Even now, I was still surprised by her excessive obedience. While she busied herself packing, I collected the talismans I had spread around, noting that the Qi in the cave had already drained. Surprising, as I calculated the purified Qi should have kept her going for another day at least. </p><p>And, since I could see there was no leak, it meant her absorption had quickened. </p><p>“Give me your hand,” I said, and she did so. I probed her cultivation, and saw that her dantian was finally complete, which was far stronger than mine or Aisnam’s, though it was not a surprise considering the amount of Qi she had consumed to finally reach the first stage of Qi Gathering, significantly more than a cultivator required to reach to the Peak of the Qi Gathering realm. </p><p>I let her hand go, expecting her to ask a question. She did not. “You have finally reached the first stage, congratulations,” I said. </p><p>“I … I did,” she whispered, her expression split between elation, surprise, and worry. Understandable, particularly with the unique circumstances of her cultivation, progressing automatically without her involvement. </p><p>Even for me, meeting her consumption was a challenge. And I was cheating shamelessly. </p><p>“Perfect,” I said as I carefully uprooted the spirit plants and put them into my storage ring. </p><p>“Let’s go,” I said, and we started traveling toward Markas. The journey allowed me to observe the speed of her Qi-starvation. Luckily, while the amount of Qi she needed had increased, her improved cultivation had also come with a stronger body, giving her more time before her Qi starvation turned deadly. </p><p>We didn’t talk much as we moved, using the opportunity to test the benefits of her new cultivation. While she didn’t have any Qi in her dantian — all available amounts already absorbed by her first gate to boost her cultivation — the passive improvement she had received alone was enough to show the incredible nature of her cultivation. </p><p>In raw power, she was stronger than me, though it wasn’t as shocking as her comparison with Aisnam. Their passive improvement was close enough that I wouldn’t be able to say which one was stronger without direct competition. </p><p>A shocking result considering there were seven minor stages between them, which was supposed to be impossible to surpass. </p><p>I continued observing her as we covered the distance, but she soon noticed the many forts between the capital and Markas. “What’s going on?” she asked. </p><p>“Tiger Fist army preparing to attack Markas,” I started before giving her a rough breakdown of the situation. However, I didn’t mention what I had been doing to protect Markas at first, watching to see if she was alarmed by it. </p><p>I wanted to see how she would react to the distress of the city she had once lived in, but she seemed not to be particularly torn up about it. However, considering she had been living as an indentured servant there, maybe it was my mistake to expect patriotism from her. </p><p>“Do you need me to do anything, sir?” she asked. </p><p>“No. I have everything in hand,” I said. “I just want you to stay in the formation I prepared for you and cultivate… Speaking of it, we’re already there,” I said. </p><p>She gasped. “All those flowers. They are beautiful, sir.” </p><p>“Good, it’s going to be your new home,” I said as I pointed at the valley, and opened the formation, allowing her to walk in. “Now, the rules.” </p><p>“Your wishes, my command, sir,” she said, dedicated. </p><p>“Excellent. We have only three of them. The first rule: never reveal yourself unless you have no other choice. No matter what happens outside,” I said. “The formations will prevent anyone from accidentally coming here, so don’t believe if anyone visits, faking distress.” </p><p>She nodded. </p><p>“Good. Let’s move on to the second rule. If anyone manages to discover you, tell them an immortal had taken you as a disciple, and he set up the valley for you to cultivate until he returns. If they insist on attacking, activate the defenses and kill them.” </p><p>Another decisive nod, showing that she was far more comfortable with the idea of killing than I was. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said as I carved her a small sigil out of stone, and imbued it with my Qi before passing it to her. “This is a part of formation, and it’ll allow you access to formation. Don’t lose it, or you can’t walk out.” </p><p>She nodded again. </p><p>“Excellent,” I said. “Now, why don’t we walk into your new home,” I said, and together, we walked into the valley, which had nothing but a nice spring. The moment we walked into the formation, the Qi the formations had collected gathered around her, filling her body. Her face lost its tenseness. </p><p>While she looked around, I grabbed a piece of wood. A slash of my Qi dagger, and it turned into a nice plague. I carved a name to it, using my dagger. Normally, carving on wood required specialized equipment, but as my Calligraphy improved, I wasn’t limited by such pedestrian concerns. Everything could be a tool. </p><p>The benefits of Major Immersion were incredible. </p><p>There were only two words to it. </p><p>Seeking Immortality. </p><p>Pearyin gasped as she saw the text, which was not an exaggeration. The words carried the full weight of my Calligraphy skill, creating an oppressive feeling. “I want you to build an extra cottage. No need to put any furniture inside, but hang this plague inside. If any intruder manages to break in, they might be intimidated. </p><p>After all, there were many tales of seclusive masters walking around the world. I didn’t know just how common it was in reality, but I was more than happy to use it as a shield at the last minute. </p><p>“I will do so, sir,” she said, and immediately started working. She didn’t have any tools but a small knife, but she didn’t need any either. Not when she could casually break trees with a punch. She was getting stronger. </p><p>”Good, feel free to decorate the valley as you wish. It’s going to be your home from now on,” I said. Meanwhile, I turned back. </p><p>I still have formations to set. And, with the spirit stones I received from the System, I finally had the materials to do so. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I watched Aisnam leave the palace with her puppet, still decisively maintaining the illusion that she was a mere servant of the Queen. </p><p>I was tempted to follow her, particularly since the being locked in the tomb was still sleeping after its earlier exertion and the observation was unnecessary. Unfortunately, she was also a cultivator of the Eight Stage of Qi Gathering, and I wasn’t entirely confident I could stay hidden. I was confident doing so if she treated the outing casually, but not when she was on high alert. </p><p>I still went out, but it was a shorter trip, toward the outer palace, taking in the changes. The first thing I noticed was the guards around the Spring Palace were gone. At first, I found that surprising, but then, I discovered the reason. </p><p>All available guards had been transferred to the outer walls, waiting in alert. The reason was easy to see. The Tiger Fist army had surrounded the palace, led by five Connate Realm martial artists, leading an army of a thousand as they surrounded the palace, waiting for something. At a distance, I could see the Royal Auction house in ruins. </p><p>“Interesting,” I muttered as I returned to the Spring Palace. I had expected the Tiger Fist army to act recklessly after seeing them effectively rob people of the capital, but actually putting the palace under siege had surpassed my expectations. </p><p>I didn’t do anything to break the siege. After her recovery and her breakthrough, she was capable enough to intervene if she had a problem. Instead, once I returned to the palace, I dug the jade stones around the Palace, and I now realized that they were not merely talismans that were crafted into jades, but formation stones. </p><p>At this point, I was skilled enough to easily read and analyze the formation. Interestingly, it was actually laid down using Nabata formation art, which was easy to see with my expertise. </p><p>Even more interestingly, it was the work of a professional, someone who had reached Major Familiarity — which was significant for people who weren't casually cheating. Alas, the formation stones had been crafted well. Together, they were supposed to protect both the Spring Palace and the garden from cursed Qi. The formation expert was capable enough to do so. </p><p>Yet, the layout had several problems that significantly limited the performance, and they were clearly not accidents. However, someone had gone to enough trouble to make them look accidental, in a way that would erode slowly until it had collapsed. </p><p>Deliberate sabotage. </p><p>I didn’t know why the Nabata sect tried to sabotage Aisnam’s formation secretly, nor did I care. The Nabata sect had been destroyed by that crazy swordsman, burying any political machinations they had planned with their sect. </p><p>What scared me was how such a fault might have interacted with the imprisoned being. I shivered. What would have happened if the containment had failed when Aisnam was still weak and caught her without a protection charm. </p><p>I shivered. It would have been a disaster. </p><p>“Why every little corner of this fucking world is filled with landmines,” I muttered in frustration even as I started repairing the formation, but in a limited capacity. </p><p>Once I finished repairing it, its function stayed the same. I could have fixed its main function of containing cursed Qi completely, but someone might take notice of the sudden change in the garden and act. </p><p>However, while its surface stayed the same, its infrastructure had changed completely. I had not only removed the deliberately engineered fault, but also added several contingencies that would be triggered once the density of cursed Qi spiked. It would be enough to prevent any possession attempt on the surface. </p><p>Hopefully. </p><p>“I have done all I could,” I muttered as I went back inside, and started preparing the bath and other requirements. Everything needed to be ready for her return. </p><p>I was in the kitchen, preparing desserts when Aisnam returned, carrying a large bag along with her puppet. And, even from a distance, I could feel Qi radiating from the bag, signaling her success. </p><p>I quickened the preparations while she went upstairs, and returned with a small box. “Welcome back. Nice trip?” I said as I turned toward her, the mixing dish still on hand as I stirred the cream — one underrated advantage of cultivation, making whipped cream by hand was much easier. </p><p>A domestic scene. </p><p>“It was productive. The Queen was satisfied,” she said. </p><p>“Good. Then come here and we can work on letting you catch up with her,” I replied as she approached, and I hugged her. “So, that’s the trade stuff?” I asked. </p><p>“No, they are still with Her Highness,” she answered as she gave the box to me. “This is for you.” She didn’t need to say the last part, as the notifications that had popped were a sufficient answer. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 50; Pampering Bonus - 75 (Capped)]</p><p>[125x Return - Recovery Pill, Black Medium-Grade]</p><p>[125x Return - Great Blade of Verdant Domain, Black Medium-Grade]</p><p>[125x Return - 125 Spirit Stones, Low-Grade]</p><p>“For me?” I asked, my eyes widening as I did my best to act like I was impacted by the thought behind the gift rather than the gift itself. Another skill I had cultivated before my summoning. It was a good way to keep the gifts flowing. “Thank you,” I said as I hugged her, not even opening the box before kissing her. </p><p>She was smiling when I pulled back. “Are you sure you want to thank me before opening the box? Maybe you’ll not like the rewards.” </p><p>I barely held back a chuckle. I already knew that the box held a Profound Peak-Grade sword and Profound Peak-Grade Recovery pill, as at this point, I had already discovered that a hundred and twenty-five-time return corresponded to six minor ranks. The System’s ability to reveal the content of the box was nothing compared to its other benefits, but it was still an amusing gimmick. </p><p>The only thing that surprised me was the spirit stones. The return implied that there was only one spirit stone there. Still a treasure for a mortal, so I wasn’t complaining, but a curious choice indeed. </p><p>“It doesn’t matter what you have brought to me. The fact that you thought giving me a gift is all I need.” </p><p>“Very well,” she said, then gestured to the box. “Open it.” </p><p>“If you wish,” I said, and opened the box, though my eyes widened as I checked the contents. I didn’t need to fake my surprise, though the target was different. A sword, a small jade bottle that held the pill … and a pouch holding a hundred spirit stones. </p><p>“It’s a Verdant sword, a Qi-forged artifact designed for martial artists,” she said, thinking that my surprise was about the sword. “You can wield it without a problem, grab it,” she said. </p><p>I did so, acting fascinated as I grabbed the sword, once again very careful acting, as it was the second step of keeping the gifts coming. The claims about not caring about the gifts' price were just a basis, followed by a fascinated gaze. </p><p>But, it was important to have a good reason for such a thing. A sports car was not about its price, but its speed to support my fascination with racing; an expensive watch was about my fascination with mechanical clocks; a nice condo at the city center because it was closer to her. </p><p>In the world of cultivation, where expensive often meant significantly better, it was an easier fiction to maintain. “Fascinating,” I said as I grabbed the sword, which was green and inlaid with leaves, clearly belonging to the Verdant family. </p><p>I tested its balance as I swung it back and forth gently, testing its balance. It was not an exaggeration to say that it was the best weapon I had ever held. The dagger I had received from the System was stronger as it was made for cultivators, but it was also damaged, which damaged its balance and its functions. </p><p>The Verdant Sword felt perfect in my hand. “Is there a special way to use it,” I asked as I caressed its razor-sharp edge. </p><p>“It can use spirit stones to compensate for a lack of Qi,” she said as she opened the pouch holding the stones. The spirit stones were much better than the ones I had received from the cultivation market. They were small, misshapen rocks with no uniformity of shape or energy. </p><p>Meanwhile, the pouch she presented me had a hundred identical stones, each carefully chipped to fit perfectly to the small gap at the hilt of the sword. </p><p>She went through the steps to use it. “Can we try?” I asked. </p><p>“Yes, let me show,” she said as she put the spirit stone in place, and a thin layer of Qi covered the sword immediately. “Once the spirit stone is in place, it can cut through the natural resistance of the Connate realm artists and weaker cultivators,” she said. </p><p>“It looks expensive.” </p><p>“Yes, it was a part of the Queen's dowry,” she commented, her tone suddenly dark. It wasn’t a surprising reaction considering how both her husband and her family betrayed her after she arrived here. </p><p>Still, it was a dangerous topic, so I decided to change it. “Is there a way to discharge the Qi directly as some kind of slash?” I asked, and she continued going through the functions. </p><p>No need to ruin her mood by making her think about unproductive things when there were far more productive things we might have been doing. </p>",

    "content": "<p>As I left the old lady Helnam behind, there was only one detail that prevented my good mood from reaching the level of elation. </p><p>That, unless I was willing to face a small army of martial artists to transport savage beasts endlessly, I had to set the formation on Markas, which would link me to the proxy war that was going on there even deeper. </p><p>Unfortunately, arranging the delivery of that many savage beasts would probably be more problematic. At least, large swathes of Markas were currently abandoned, and there were enough savage beasts that the absence of a few would raise no suspicions. </p><p>And, if I was being honest, at this point I was scared that, if I tried to get away from Markas, I would still find myself entangled. At least, by establishing a secret formation beforehand, I would have a secure base that could be leveraged for many purposes, from counter-attacking to defense. </p><p>Especially if I could build an escape tunnel that would avoid the notice of even the stronger cultivators. Not possible at my current level of expertise … but it might not be as impossible as my skills continue to increase. </p><p>As I passed Markas border, I abandoned those thoughts for a different one. Namely, where to set up the formation. The direction of the capital was out, as there was a Tiger Fist army coming from that direction. Similarly, the direction of the anomaly with the highest density of Savage Beasts was out. Kartpa Valley was responsible for it, and I didn’t want to risk getting detected. </p><p>In the end, I picked a direction that was far away from both, toward wilderness near the official borders, which had little population even before the evacuation. A little exploration brought me to a nice concealed valley nestled between seven hills. </p><p>A nice geographical structure to set up a formation. I could establish the core in the valley, with seven supporting structures, one for each hill, which I would populate with enough spirit plants to act as batteries for the main formation. The extra space would be useful for the additional formations, like a small illusionary formation that would hide the valley from anyone that flew above it, maybe a misdirection one to lead any intruder away before they realized. </p><p>Formations offered truly endless possibilities. Of those possibilities,  most I couldn’t implement immediately, as I lacked time, skill, and most importantly, materials, but the initial Qi gathering array for the valley, and the foundation of the first spirit plant garden on the first hill was easy to do. </p><p>In that garden, I used only ten seeds from the System, and used almost three hundred Qi strands to hasten their growth; an amount that was supposed to be impossible for a Peak Qi cultivator, let alone one at the Third Stage, but it wasn’t the only topic I was cheating at. </p><p>Each seed took about thirty strands on average, which was several times higher than I had used for the plants in Pearyin’s cave, but their quality made a huge difference. Even as a mere sprout, they generated a surprising amount of Qi. </p><p>Around them, I added a hundred more seeds, the ones that I received from Helnam without the System improvement. They were almost dead, but once again, the higher skill level made all the difference. A few strands of Qi, a lot of fertilizers in the form of processed savage beasts parts. </p><p>The best part, I didn’t need to waste my own Qi. Instead, I used the meditation technique to channel the Qi that was generated by the first set of plants. I chose to germinate them after the first group, because they were too fragile to handle a bigger infusion.</p><p>They had to grow slowly. It was for that reason I set a smaller formation around them, slowly channeling the Qi generated by their higher-quality variants, and only the excess was transferred to the central valley. </p><p>Unfortunately, I lacked the time and materials for the formation that I planned to target the savage beasts, so I had to hunt them directly, which took some more of my time. Then, I had to hasten their breakdown with my snow and volcano essences, which took me even longer. </p><p>When I finished setting everything, it was already evening. </p><p>“Beautiful,” I muttered as I looked at the wild valley, the formation already gathering some Qi. Spirit plant care at Minor Immersion worked wonders with high-quality seeds and my generous Qi investment. Luckily, that was the last time I had been planning to invest such an absurd amount. </p><p>As a final touch, I set another purification setup with the talismans at the center valley, in order to supply Pearyin for the first couple of days, and departed. </p><p>Hoping that no cultivator would stumble by accident. There was no Qi leak, but the illusion formation I was able to set up was very limited. </p><p>Even with the skill increase, I would require weeks to properly set the planned formations. </p><p>With the initial setup done, I decided to return to the capital rather than visit Pearyin. She still had some Qi to meet her consumption until the next evening, and it would give a chance for Qi to accumulate a bit. </p><p>However, on my way back, I approached several forts Tiger Fist had been on the way between the capital and Markas, spying on their force deployment and construction progress, and writing another letter from Aisnam’s ‘collaborators’ about the latest movement of the enemy. </p><p>I also added a note, hoping for quicker delivery of talisman and formation supplies if possible, promising to pay a bonus on the agreed price in the form of different types of talismans, including lightning, shield, and concealment talismans if she preferred. </p><p>The new base I had created already had a formation, but I doubted if it could resist the assault of a Connate realm martial artist, let alone an attack from a cultivator. Using ordinary materials for formations had very clear limits. </p><p>The formation would have been stronger if I used all seven hills to defend the place, but without the spirit plant gardens to support them, the amount of Qi they consumed would have been counter-productive, at least immediately. And, without the correct materials, even setting a large formation that used all seven hills as anchors wouldn’t keep a peak Qi cultivator out. </p><p>I needed better materials, and I hoped that Aisnam would rob the royal family for it under the promise of sufficient rewards. I was betting that the royal family managed to get some formation supplies from the destroyed Nabata Mansion. </p><p>As for why I didn’t try robbing the royal palace myself … two reasons. Aisnam was far stronger than me. I might burst with a stronger speed if I was willing to reveal the full range of my abilities, but it wouldn’t be subtle. </p><p>Also, Aisnam was familiar with the inner region of the palace. I never stepped foot there, and currently, due to the aggression of the Tiger Fist army, they were on high alert, which made sneaking in an even bigger risk than usual.</p><p>Letting Aisnam do that was much easier. </p><p>While on the tunnel, I spent some time in front of the stone door. First, I tried to talk with the being, to see if they woke up. They were still sleeping, as indicated by the listlessness of the cursed Qi that filled the tunnel. </p><p>I spent some more time trying to decipher symbols on the stone door, but they were just as meaningless. Either I needed to have a deeper expertise in formation technique, or no matter how much I learned, the Nabata technique wouldn’t cover something that complicated. </p><p>I hoped the first was the case, but I feared the second… </p><p>“You’re late, again,” Aisnam said to me as I entered, frowning, but this time, it felt fake. </p><p>“Sorry about it, once again, they kept me out for the delivery,” I said as I passed her the letter and the package. Her frown stayed, which didn’t surprise me. After all, it wasn’t what she was baiting for. I hugged her from behind while she opened the letter. “Sorry ... about ... being ... late,” I whispered, kissing her neck after every word. “How can I make it up to you?” </p><p>“Well, I have some ideas for our study session,” she answered with a beautiful smile, her frown quick to disappear. </p><p>“Whatever you wish?” I said but continued raining her soft skin with kisses. “Do you want to do that thing with silk and ice that you enjoyed very much the last time?” </p><p>“Tempting…” she muttered, but her eyes were on the letter. “Unfortunately, it looks like I have to accompany Her Highness for a quick trip, so it has to wait for a while.” </p><p>I kissed her neck. “Disappointing, but why don’t I draw you a bath and prepare a meal so we can enjoy ourselves a bit before another study session,” I added. </p><p>“Excellent idea,” she said, kissed me once more, and left. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“I’m really glad that I could bypass sleep so easily,” I muttered as I once again used the cursed tunnel to leave, this time not collecting any of the Cursed Qi. With its flow stopping, taking any of it would be too noticeable, and under the circumstances, it was better to play safe. </p><p>I still remembered the commotion that awakening my first Major Immersion skill had caused, enough to scare me despite being in a cave. Therefore, I actually made sure to move out of Zaim completely before finding a nice, deep cave and triggering my new rewards one by one. </p><p>The amount of information that flowed into my mind as I activated Major Immersion calligraphy was impressive, but it didn’t shock me. Nor did the intense glow that stuck around for about ten minutes. </p><p>In contrast, the glow from the Minor Immersion talisman technique faded after ten seconds, but the information that it brought together was complicated. Absurdly so. I had a feeling that, without the System protecting me, my brain would have leaked out of my ears. </p><p>“I wonder just how the quality of my talismans is impacted,” I said as I pulled a paper from my storage ring, and drew a quick one. I used fully subdued Qi from my inventory, as at this point, I wasn’t exactly hurting for a mere strand, which helped the quality further. I drew a protection talisman, in case I needed against the imprisoned being once it woke up. </p><p>The result: Yellow-Medium Grade. </p><p>Incredible. At this point, after interacting with the cultivation world, I realized just how valuable such a high-grade talisman was. Too bad it was too valuable to be sold, even by Aisnam. Even giving them to Pearyin for self-defense, or using them myself was an unacceptable risk. Just their existence alone might trigger a hunt as cultivators desperate for a fortune risking their lives to kill her to find the source. </p><p>“Now, to the star of the show,” I muttered, and triggered the formation lesson. </p><p>The amount of information it triggered was far less than the talisman technique, yet that did nothing to hurt my growing smile. Learning how to draw better talismans was useful, especially since it was after just a dedicated study of one night rather than a lifetime. </p><p>Formation lesson, on the other hand, was a true treasure. I paused, examining my new capabilities, and understanding exactly what I learned. </p><p>It turned out, that my analogy about likening it to some kind of temperamental computer program was more accurate than I had first expected. The formation knowledge came in two main categories, one about the building blocks I could collect and how they could be used, and one about how it could be laid across a landscape based on its geographical features, Qi content, function … and hundreds of other features. </p><p>The best thing, unlike talismans, it meshed well with my existing knowledge. My ability with spirit plants, for example, gave me a good idea about how to integrate living plants into their structure. A fascinating benefit, especially since, while I couldn’t use my subdued Qi to feed Pearyin, I could use it to hasten the growth of spiritual plants as long as I had enough fertilizer.</p><p>Which meant, savage beasts. Hundreds of them … thousands, even. </p><p>“Oh, fuck,” I muttered as the realization hit. There was only one way I could bring around such a great number of savage beasts. </p><p>Markas. </p><p>Unfortunately, my only other option was the misty mountains, which was an even worse location than Markas. At least, in Markas, I knew cultivators wouldn’t be teeming in the wilderness. Misty Mountains was filled with high-level cultivators seeking fortune, including Foundation Establishment cultivators. </p><p>If I established a large formation there and it was discovered, hundreds of cultivators would siege it, thinking that there was a treasure. Itinerant cultivators were like locusts, never leaving a bite untouched. </p><p>In comparison, the challenge of finding enough seeds was much more mild. I already knew where I could find a spiritual plant enthusiast, one who might be willing to give me a lot of them if I visited her. Ideally, as a gift that would trigger the System, but if not, I was willing to pay with a talisman I had ‘found’. </p><p>There were several more options, from asking — or faking — a letter from Aisnam to flat-out thievery, but I doubted that any of them would be necessary. The old lady had already been impressed by the star-crossed love story between her grand niece who had been trapped in a loveless political marriage and the genius martial artist, and I would be a very incompetent freeloader if I couldn’t use that to get a bunch of discarded seeds. </p><p>Rabbit Dash once again proved its value as I covered the distance that needed weeks in mere a few hours, and soon, I was looking at the Verdant Mansion near the capital. I observed the mansion for a while, looking for changes. </p><p>The only difference was that the inner courtyard was empty, with guards banished away, focusing on the outer walls. Bypassing them had been easy, and soon, I was in the inner garden. Sneaking in had been easy, which would have been an oversight if not for one fact. </p><p>Even in her diminished state, she was many times stronger than her guards. </p><p>She moved, noticing my presence, but she didn’t show herself immediately. I waited for her patiently, giving no sign that I noticed her movement. I was already being presumptuous by visiting her without permission and bypassing guards, but that could still be framed as a valiant action. </p><p>Valiant was good, arrogant was not. </p><p>I knelt as I waited for her, no matter how much it was annoying to keep waiting while I had more important things to do. I felt her probing me with her Qi, which I tricked with my essence to hide my real cultivation. </p><p>She kept me waiting for an hour before she appeared. “Why are you here, boy,” she asked in lieu of greeting. </p><p>“I come here to inform you that Aisnam has recovered, an esteemed cultivator,” I said. Technically, it was a risk, but a very small one. If she wasn’t on Aisnam’s side, she wouldn’t have spent what was without a doubt a fortune to purchase that pill, probably overpaying significantly. </p><p>The Treasure Pavilion didn’t give me the impression of a business that worked on low margins. </p><p>The three-month deadline I had earned was about to end, which lowered the risk even more. Moreover, with things in the capital heating up, and sooner and later, someone would decide that a week or two wouldn’t make too much of a difference, and would try to deal with Aisnam to get help from her opposing faction. </p><p>That, or they would lead Tiger Fist to the Spring Palace, hoping to trigger a conflict between them and the mysterious cultivator. </p><p>She examined me for a few seconds more, using her Qi to check whether I was lying. I was not. Though, if I were, I could have tricked her because she was using her medicinal abilities to check my reaction, and my abilities were better. </p><p>“Very good. I was right to trust you, young man,” she said once she was confident I wasn’t lying and let her Qi go. “You earned a boon for yourself,” she said. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 30; Pity Bonus - 40 (Capped)]</p><p>[70x Return - 3 Qi Strand]</p><p>A nice little reward, valuable because it confirmed her attitude. </p><p>“I don’t need a boon,” I refused instantly. “I did everything for … well,” I added, pushing a deep blush to my face, which earned a nostalgic smile from her. It was a good way to bait her, but also I didn’t want her to reward me for my help, knowing that it wouldn’t trigger the System if she saw it as a transaction. </p><p>“I insist,” she said. </p><p>“Alright,” I said. “Then, I would like to learn if there is a way for me to qualify to get a token for Treasure Pavilion.” </p><p>“Are you sure you want to use it for that? You won’t like the answer,” she warned. </p><p>I nodded. </p><p>“No, there’s not,” she said. “No martial artist could trade with it directly, even the royal family. Even for cultivators, anyone below Foundation Establishment could only earn one-time trade tokens with great difficulty. And, paying their price is even more difficult. That’s your answer. Are you satisfied that you wasted your boon for it?” </p><p>I sighed. “I had to try. I wished that I could …” I said, then let my tone fade, doing everything to look like a love-stricken simp that lost his chance to help the target of his obsession, and watched her expression soften. “Your garden looks beautiful,” I said as I changed the topic, as if I was desperate to hide the depths of my sadness, looking like a kicked puppy. </p><p>From there, it had been easy to swindle another crash-course lesson on gardening and spirit plant care, because I had already shown interest the previous time. I even managed to strongly hint her to give me a large sack of useless seeds so I could practice my spirit plant care for when I could get better seeds. </p><p>When I finally left the compound, I had a pile of seeds that could only germinate after months of expert care and incredible effort that would prove counterproductive. </p><p>And, several beautiful notifications. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 30; Pity Bonus - 40 (Capped)]</p><p>[70x Return - Gardening, Minor Immersion]</p><p>[70x Return - Spirit Plant Care Lesson, Perfection, Minor Immersion]</p><p>Two of them were useful, and in the long term, far more valuable.

    "content": "<p>“You’re late, again. I was worried—” Aisnam started the moment I arrived, but I silenced her with a kiss. </p><p>“Sorry, sweetie, but the chaos in the capital had complicated things a bit, so the trade had been delayed,” I said. “But it was worth the wait.” </p><p>“I have to see to —” she started as she unfurled the fabric, only for her eyes to widen. “Is that…” </p><p>“A complete book on formations, yes,” I said, my arms still around her waist. “It’s written especially for beginners. I’m sure you’ll be very helpful to the Queen once you learn it successfully,” I added immediately. “And, we can study together, with me practicing my Calligraphy while you work on your formations.” </p><p>“I don’t know…” she started, but I kissed her neck, just the way she liked it. </p><p>“It would give you a reason to spend even more of your day together with me. Of course, if you don’t want to do that…” I whispered, then continued to kiss her neck, using my literal magical talents to great effect. </p><p>There was a reason honey traps had been a devastating tool forever… </p><p>“I’m sure — Her Highness would find that acceptable,” she whispered. “Now, let me go so I can explain it to her.” </p><p>“Of course,” I said, but I didn’t let her go for another ten minutes, and she didn’t mention anything about letting her go, at the risk of angering her imaginary boss. </p><p>When she went upstairs, I visited my room first and hid the storage ring. Luckily, it was very difficult to detect in its dormant state, and its small size made it even easier to hide. Then, I visited the kitchen, prepared a nice snack board with some drinks, and visited the study room, which hadn’t been used much since my return. </p><p>I had been prioritizing gathering Qi over my skills, which, I had to admit, was a bit of an oversight. I have been neglecting to work our skills together, too focused on improving my Qi. Hopefully, it would be enough to push my critical skills like calligraphy and talisman-making to Major Immersion. </p><p>Hopefully, to an even higher degree. </p><p>Aisnam returned several minutes later, using her time to categorize other items I had brought her to facilitate her deal. I didn’t know exactly where she would be trading them, or even whether she had been planning to travel, or using one of her contacts to arrange some kind of pickup. </p><p>Either way, she was here, nestled against me as she read her book, while I worked on my Calligraphy. She often commented on my work. And, since I made sure to work on letters that could be used for Talismans and Formations, I was able to use them as an excuse to squeeze more questions about talismans and formations, which she answered despite fully expecting them to be useless. </p><p>I had been using the same trick to get lessons from her since our meeting, and at this point, she was used to answering my inane, disconnected questions. It hurt her focus significantly as she tried to study, but luckily, at this point, in her isolation, I was the only source of entertainment, and she was willing to make some sacrifices to keep me happy. </p><p>Benefits of being a good boy toy. </p><p>Honestly, the success of this tactic was making me question just how well-thought-out the rules of the System were. That immortal woman was very annoyed when she sent me to this world … and I was wondering maybe, in her anger, she didn’t exactly consider the full implications of what even being a freeloader meant, and how easy it was to abuse the gaps. </p><p>Of course, just because I could improve far more rapidly than the others didn’t mean much. Yes, I could spend days improving faster than an ordinary cultivator that started at the same time, but I wasn’t the only freak of nature in this world. Pearyin, was one extraordinary example I had seen with my own eyes, and that crazy swordsman Xantum was another. </p><p>Who knew how many other freaks in this world. Worse, even discounting them, there were many Golden Core elders spread across many sects, each able to kill me with a flick of their fingers, and they were following the orders of even stronger cultivators… This world was a nesting Russian doll, mixed with a particularly innovative variant of Russian Roulette. </p><p>Touch the wrong thing, and it would reveal more and more enemies, until one strong enough to kill me. </p><p>I sighed, wondering why I was feeling pensive, then I realized. The encounter at the stone door, with the forced imparting of the cultivation technique, left me unsettled. </p><p>“What’s wrong?” she asked. </p><p>“Nothing, just getting frustrated by my lack of progress,” I muttered as I drew a symbol from the formations book, which could be used for many different formations. Of course, without proper materials, and without imbuing it with Qi, it was useless. </p><p>“It’s because you’re trying to draw a very complicated letter once again,” she said as she took my brush. “The sequence for this letter is not intuitive,” she said, first drawing one as I did, then drawing the second one properly. “This is how you draw it for a talisman.” She drew another one. “And, this is how you draw for a formation.” </p><p>“Why the difference?” I asked. </p><p>“It’s complicated. Why do you insist on drawing such difficult stuff? ” she complained playfully. </p><p>“I love a challenge,” I whispered as I wrapped my arms around her waist, rubbing her belly softly to pamper her. It worked perfectly as a counter-argument. “But, if you insist on not explaining, you can brush back and return to your book. I’m sure I could manage on my own.” </p><p>She chuckled, amused by my passive-aggressive needling. I used it sparingly. Passive aggressive behavior from a lover was cute and entertaining when used rarely, but as the frequency increased, it briefly touched the point of annoyance before escalating to the point of repulsiveness. </p><p>“The first thing you need to know is that it’s not a mere word, but a fundamental vessel that holds and channels Qi. The way it’s drawn affects the way it interacts with Qi, and its nature…” she started, her beautiful voice dancing in my ear while my lips danced on her neck, keeping her happy during the class. </p><p>It gave sucking up to the teacher a new meaning. </p><p>What followed was an hour-long lecture about talismans and formations. Talisman lessons were, as usual, quite intuitive. She wasn’t as good as me — inevitable considering my cheat worked based on her skill level — but her talent was still impressive. She had made considerable progress since our last talisman lesson. It was far more than any improvement I could achieve through self-study, that much was clear. </p><p>What surprised me was her insights on formations. It was hard to assess her true level with my lack of knowledge — as my knowledge of formations was limited to four hours of self-study — but at this point, I was familiar with her general attitude, and knew when she was talking about something she learned, and when she was sharing general guesswork. </p><p>And, her teachings on formations felt much like the first one. I was curious, but not enough to interrupt her lesson about formations, particularly since its importance had just risen to another level when the being that was locked behind the stone door went to sleep and stopped radiating cursed Qi. </p><p>Only after she had finished her extensive lesson on the differences, I poked that particular topic. “Have you studied Formations before? Because you sound like an expert when you talk about it,” I said, then chuckled. “It makes you very sexy.” </p><p>She chuckled, which turned into a moan as I bit her ear gently. “Not much, barely enough to see if I had any talent. I would have loved to learn more, but lessons on talisman making were expensive enough to take my contribution points already?” </p><p>“Really, you have to pay for the techniques as well,” I asked. </p><p>“Of course. Every technique is a secret. Accessing a book like this probably requires ten years of non-stop missions with serious danger.” </p><p>I didn’t need to fake my eyes widening. Here I was, thinking college was too expensive. “No wonder Tiger Fist are ready to siege the royal palace for it,” I said. </p><p>“Not my problem,” she said, showing no interest in that. </p><p>I decided to ask another question, even though I already guessed the answer. “So, do you think you can repair that stone door if you study that book?” </p><p>She chuckled. “Maybe if I have ten years, and ten more books like this…” she answered. </p><p>I said nothing else, letting her continue with her studying. Her answer didn’t surprise me. If the book could have solved her biggest problem in a reasonable timeframe, she wouldn’t have been indulging me here but instead stayed upstairs and focused on her studies. </p><p>I was a good boy toy, but not that good. </p><p>Not that I was complaining, because when the dawn arrived and she left to ‘attend’ her Queen — after a brief but very intense celebration — I was looking for a long line of notifications, with a new one earning a particularly beautiful honor. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 50; Pampering Bonus - 75 (Capped)]</p><p>[125x Return - Calligraphy Lesson- Minor Immersion, Major Immersion]</p><p>[125x Return - Verdant Brush Talisman Technique Lesson - Perfection, Minor Immersion]</p><p>[125x Return - Nataba Formation Technique Lesson - Beginner, Major Familiarity]</p><p>[125x Return - 129 Qi Strands]</p><p>Just like that, my biggest problem turned into less of a problem. </p><p>Hopefully. And, if not, convincing Aisnam to another study session wouldn’t be particularly hard considering the beautiful smile she departed with… </p>",

    "content": "<p>It was almost midnight when I managed to step into the tunnel that led to the Spring Palace. I would have loved to say it was the Tiger Fist army surrounding the palace that delayed me — my little trick with the Imperial Sword proving even more effective than I hoped — but that would be wrong. </p><p>It was Pearyin, doing her best to thank me for my patience while she was feeling distressed. </p><p>Naturally, Aisnam wouldn’t learn that particular nugget. For her, it would be the chaos of the capital that delayed me. Hopefully, the newest toy I was bringing her would keep her distracted. </p><p>I had a pack in hand, which held the forged letter, a stack of talismans for her to sell, and, most importantly, the book on formations, all framed as something for her, a payment for the services she had been preparing. </p><p>Still, I was tense as I walked into the dark tunnel, but it was not about fearing Aisnam’s response. The growing conflict with the Tiger Fist and the royal family was a good excuse for my lateness, particularly since it didn’t need any fake danger, just a delay in delivery. </p><p>I was afraid of Aisnam trying to protect me by keeping me in. After all, I was supposed to be a mere Skin Refinement martial artist, unable to fight against even a pesky Connate Realm martial artist. </p><p>However, it wasn’t the reason I was feeling tense as I walked into the dark. No, that was about the mysterious being that was locked behind the stone doors, yet aware enough to realize I was stealing the cursed Qi. </p><p>Unsettling. </p><p>I walked through the tunnel, the cursed Qi noticeably thinner after my continuous thievery. And, once I arrived in front of the door, a whisper bypassed my ears and reached directly into my mind, the method of doing so a mystery. “Naughty little cultivator. You took my Qi again. Has no one said to you that it’s rude to steal other people’s things.” </p><p>The voice was once again accompanied by memories of blood and violence. </p><p>I once again planned to ignore it, but just as I was passing in front of the Stone Door, the Cursed Qi, which was spread like a mist, stirred. It was a subtle stirring, almost like a gentle wind. It was probably nothing … but then, I was in a dark cursed tunnel, at midnight, looking to the stone doors of what most likely was a tomb with an occupant that was alive enough to communicate with me. </p><p>Taking precautions made sense. I grabbed my protective talisman while I walked forward, ready to move. </p><p>A good choice, as the cursed Qi suddenly gathered together and moved toward me. It didn’t take shape other than a soft, misty ball, with no indication of it being an attack. </p><p>I still activated a protection talisman, and jumped back. I noticed that, as the blast tried to follow me, it lost its shape rapidly. The remaining cursed Qi splashed against the activated talisman uselessly, but my success didn’t make me feel any better. The ability to mobilize Qi directly was new. </p><p>A deep breath later, I started examining the Qi flow, not wanting to commit to an escape route without checking if there was another attack. There was none. The way the earlier attack had dispersed showed that the being’s reach was limited to the immediate surroundings of the stone gate, but there was a chance that it was a deliberate trick to make me misjudge the impact. </p><p>I let out a deep breath even as I waited. It was a close call. Without my skills in meditation art, allowing me to detect the stirring, it might have ended differently. It didn’t feel like an attack … but that wasn’t a guarantee about it not being one. </p><p>And, even if it wasn’t a direct attack, there were many other results that might end badly. Maybe it was a curse, a possession method, or a way to use my power to break the restrictions. I didn’t know what was possible with cultivation, but considering everything I had seen, I suspected very little… </p><p>I waited, trying to understand their limits. Speaking was one thing, but the ability to manipulate cursed Qi was far more dangerous. I didn’t move until the activated protection talisman faded, and the second one was already in hand, ready to be activated. </p><p>“No need to panic, little cultivator, I just wanted to help, because I pity your condition,” the voice said, trying to sound wronged, which was difficult when every word awakened the images of a bloody massacre. </p><p>I started to suspect that it was not something the being had any ability to control rather than preference; that or they believed that such a mental image would help calm me down, and it was not a possibility I wanted to consider. </p><p>More importantly, I didn’t miss that, only after the activated protective talisman faded away it contacted me again, reinforcing the idea of limitations. I didn’t want to rely on my limited understanding trying to communicate with such a being, but I still depended on the cursed Qi to supply Pearyin, and Aisnam was tasked with keeping the same being inside until a formations master repaired it. </p><p>Ultimately, I decided to trust my observations, because the being tried to attack me, and failed. If they were much stronger, they wouldn’t have wasted their best chance like that.</p><p>“Well, color me surprised. It didn’t feel helpful.” </p><p>“No, it was. I was going to help you reinforce your Immortal Root. Such a diligent cultivator like you deserves better than staying forever on Third Stage. I pitied you, and decided to help it. Too bad you missed the opportunity.” </p><p>“Then, it would have been a waste. It’s not my Immortal Root that blocks me,” I answered. “I’m a mere itinerant cultivator, and I don’t have the rest of the gate transformation technique.” </p><p>It wasn’t that I wasn’t unaware of the risk mere communication represented, but at this point, trying to learn more about the being felt like the better option rather than ignoring its growing abilities. They were spending time getting on my good side for some reason now that their attack failed, likely to convince me to damage the formations that were keeping it trapped further. </p><p>I didn’t want to see what they would do if they were convinced of their failure. </p><p>“An itinerant cultivator, yet you can control that much Qi with a mere meditation technique. Very impressive,” the voice answered. </p><p>“Nothing I could do. For years, I practiced it before I could get my hands on an incomplete transformation technique. And, when I had acquired one just last month, I quickly reached the Third Stage,” I said. </p><p>I mixed lies and truths together to increase my value in their eyes — if they had eyes in the first place. Even if my trick to quicken my learning about formations worked, I would still need time to improve enough to understand what was going on there, which was not necessarily possible. </p><p>“What a waste of talent,” the voice said, and another whisper hit my head unprompted, and I wasn’t able to push it away. “Study it well. It’s a much better technique than whatever garbage you are using,” the voice said, but it was visibly weakened. Whatever it had done to transfer knowledge directly into my mind, it exhausted the being. </p><p>“Just like that. Why?” I asked. </p><p>“Because it’s a pity to waste such a talent,” the voice said. “Take it as a gift from me. Return after cultivating. Now, I need to sleep…” </p><p>With that, cursed Qi went through a subtle change. It was still a presence that corroded living beings, but it turned softer, more docile. I asked a few more questions, but there was no answer. </p><p>I continued walking toward the Spring Palace, pondering what happened. </p><p>I had no doubt that their claim that it was a gift was a bald-faced lie … well, first of all, basic common sense, as trusting the generosity of a being that evoked the dreams of massacres with every word was insane. Cultivators were supposed to be power-hungry, but even they wouldn’t go and cultivate a technique that was an obvious trap. </p><p>Right? </p><p>The second reason was more of a supporting proof. The being claimed that it was a no-string gift, but it didn’t trigger the System. </p><p>I wanted to get rid of the technique, but it was already in my mind, as if it was a book I could peruse easily. It was different from a System-enhanced lesson, as those were directly comprehended. What I received was more of a mental book. </p><p>Also, those guesses were unrelated to whether that technique was a trap, or it was the bait before the trap. Maybe it was a way for them to prove their good intent and it was actually a perfectly fine technique, or maybe it was a method to change my body so they could possess me. </p><p>Either way, I didn’t plan to use it unless I faced a great challenge. I barely checked its contents, only to see it hundreds of times more complicated than the Verdant Gate technique that I was currently using. It was impossible for me to check it for any possible traps. </p><p>But, as I moved away, I couldn’t help but sigh as I realized something else important. The stone gates stopped radiating cursed Qi, adding another trouble to my list. </p><p>With a sigh, I walked forward, hoping that learning formations wouldn’t be as hard as I feared. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Why so surprised —” she started, which was all she was able to say before I grabbed her wrist and pulled her to my lap, delivering a short yet searing kiss. </p><p>“W-wow,” she stammered with a beautiful expression of shock, though hers was more interesting than mine. As she sat on my lap, I enjoyed her smell. </p><p>“Looks like I’m not the only one that’s shocked,” I answered. It was fun to reverse the situation after letting her get one victory. “But, I can always shock you more…” I added, but the cute brunette waitress returned. </p><p>I didn’t need my observation to notice she had unbuttoned her shirt somewhat to get a better cleavage to bait for more tips. A good indicator that she was a poor waitress, considering she used that tactic while I was waiting for a date. </p><p>Maybe she just assumed Emily wouldn’t arrive soon, and wanted to try if she could bait for more tips. Either way, her expression was beautiful. I said nothing to Emily about our waitress to hide the fact I noticed her. Instead, I kissed Emily again before pulling back, allowing her to catch a glimpse of our voyeur. </p><p>I was curious about how she would react, by hesitation, or by daring. </p><p>The moment she noticed the waitress, she pulled back, her eyes widening. I tightened my eyes enough to make her think I closed them, giving her a chance to process the fact that our kiss, far too naughty for a public space due to her blouse, was being watched by a stranger. </p><p>She might be an exhibitionist, but she had also been shy enough to not dare explore that part of hers before we met, so I wasn’t sure how she would react to a real-life presence. At the same time, I watched the gaze of the waitress from the mirror. </p><p>Was what I had been doing necessary for Emily’s eventual recruitment. Certainly not, but I had spent most of my day walking around the electronics stores and digging through both the new and second-hand offerings to hide the source of my purchases. It had been a long and annoying afternoon. </p><p>I deserved some entertainment. </p><p>Emily and the waitress locked eyes for a moment. Emily looked shocked, which added to her beauty with the state of her blouse. The waitress was caught flatfooted. Slut, she mouthed to Emily, but there was no hiding her jealousy. Interesting. I didn’t expect our short contact to develop into a small crush… </p><p>Though, as I watched their silent stand-off, I realized it was less about the slight crush she might have developed toward the generous customer, and more about a personal hang-up. As she watched us, her gaze drifted to the left upward with a dazed expression, while her expression flashed with a momentary anger. </p><p>She was remembering something of her past. No wonder she reacted to the situation that badly. Interesting. I couldn’t help but wonder exactly what had been going on. </p><p>I expected Emily to flinch, but instead, her smile grew as she grabbed my head and pulled to her bosom, reacting to the waitress’ challenge more explosively than I expected. The waitress’s face blanched, her memories doing wonders. </p><p>Entertaining indeed. </p><p>Being buried in Emily’s incredible bosom made it harder to observe my surroundings, but not entirely impossible. I could still hear the waitress’ footsteps, hitting the floor harder than necessary, yet her gait was shorter than her usual walk. She wanted to confront Emily, but she was afraid to do so. </p><p>She came to an abrupt stop a couple of paces from us, and after a momentary silence that was only broken by her hands moving, no doubt making some gestures, she walked away, apparently disconcerted. Even with my power, I wasn’t able to read the gestures by the sounds they made, but luckily, the situation wasn’t hard to decipher. She tried to intimidate Emily, failed, and retreated. </p><p>I wondered if she would have made a move if she hadn’t been risking the promised six-hundred-dollar tip. </p><p>I stayed buried in Emily’s bosom, content to act passively while Emily enjoyed the stage I had set for her to fulfill her exhibitionist kink. </p><p>Even I hadn’t expected things to evolve this way, certainly not this quick. </p><p>Emily let me go only when the waitress had turned away, leaving us alone in the relatively concealed corner. “Not that I was complaining, but what was that for?” I asked, acting like I didn’t even notice the waitress. </p><p>That earned a smug smile from Emily, happy that she distracted me enough to completely conceal the waitress’s presence. “I just missed you,” she said as she finally left my lap, and took her own seat. She closed two of the buttons for her blouse, turning it back to merely erotic instead of downright obscene. </p><p>“Maybe I should keep you away for a few days more, and see what kind of greeting I would get,” I said with a smirk. </p><p>“Well, maybe I should stay away and see!” she admonished me, but it was just for show. </p><p>“Staying away will be hard, but rewards might be worth it,” I said, letting my gaze devour her beauty. She played with her hair, her blonde locks landing on her cleavage. </p><p>“You seem to be fascinated by my … hair,” she teased. </p><p>“What can I say, you have excellent … hair,” I responded. “An excellent pair.” </p><p>“You’re so bad,” she chuckled, though her tone was louder than usual, making sure the waitress heard it as well. We chatted for a while. While I called her for an important mission, there was no harm in delaying it more. It would feed her ego that she was able to make me forget a critical issue. </p><p>I cared about the mission, but not as much as converting her to my side full-time. With continuing to collapse, superpowered tech support was an invaluable potential… </p><p>And, it wasn’t like a date with a sexy blonde that was in the process of discovering her sexuality was some kind of great torture. </p><p>She smirked when we heard the footsteps, ready for the next confrontation with her accidental rival. It was different than her usual smile. Arrogant, yet sexy. It was also fragile, as if she was trying a new dress at the tailor before adjustments. Eager yet hesitant, ready to slip away at the slightest tremble, more show than substance, yet promising. It did interesting things to her lips. </p><p>I liked her new smirk. </p><p>Paradoxically, I liked her expression just as much when that smirk faded just as quickly, leaving only fragility behind. </p><p>The reason: our waitress. </p><p>Honestly, if it wasn’t for my experience hiding my true feelings, which had been perfected against deadly villains that would have no problems killing me if they caught a glimpse of the truth, it would have been difficult for me to hold back. </p><p>She had changed her clothes. Gone was the sensible jeans and shirt combo, replaced by a set of gym clothes, the kind that was designed not for people that actually exercised, but people that decided to treat gyms as a location to share their sexy photos. </p><p>It was supposed to be a simple combo of yoga pants and a crop top with spaghetti straps. Relatively modest, if it was not for one important detail. They didn’t belong to her, but someone with more modest curves. Therefore, the elastic of the yoga pants stretched to the limit, to the point that it turned slightly transparent, so that, even without my power, I could easily spot her lack of underwear. </p><p>Daring. </p><p>Her top was the same. It was already designed to leave the stomach of the wearer bare and stick tightly to not to impede the movement, but since they were designed for someone with smaller tits, it stretched badly, and the cleavage was deeper than intended. Her rock-hard nipples didn’t make its job any easier. </p><p>As she walked closer, her gaze was turned to Emily, answering her earlier challenge.</p><p>I had to admit, she was beautiful, but just like Emily, her confidence barely hid the fragility behind her. As she approached, I continued to read her attitude, making some conclusions about her past. Her talent at music, combined with her reaction to Emily — and a hundred little details that were picked by my power — told a cliche story. </p><p>She almost certainly experienced an ugly duckling story. She had gone most of her childhood and teenage years with relative invisibility, and focused on her instrument to combat her loneliness. Then, at some point, probably near her graduation date, she started to change, thinking that she could join the clique of the beautiful now that she was one, but learned that the popular people circle was far more merciless. </p><p>I was mostly sure that she started dating one of the popular boys, only to catch him together with a blonde cheerleader with certain … assets. Probably from an angle that was similar to ours, which would explain her visceral reaction. </p><p>I was also sure that she had another waitress inside who knew the story, and just goaded her to change and teach ‘that bitch’ a lesson. </p><p>Once again, as she approached, I was fascinated. Not by her beauty — though it was certainly admirable — but how much people had revealed about their past when they were frustrated and angry. I decided to tease them further, to see what else I could discover. </p><p>Was that the best way to train my power? Maybe, or maybe not? </p><p>But it was the most entertaining one. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Once I decided to get Emily’s help to secure my bar, I started working on how to expand those plans. </p><p>I spent most of the day shopping for cameras and other detection equipment under various disguises. Not just cameras, but also thermal detection equipment, noise detectors, movement sensors, the whole kit, enough to cover the whole neighborhood. Also, I bought three computers, one to stay in my office and act as a dummy, and the other two for the basement we dug, to create a real command center. </p><p>Carrying all of them while trying to avoid attention took quite a bit of time. I even had to bring Tara out to help a couple of times, leaving the bar temporarily defenseless. </p><p>Altogether, they were far cheaper than a full-fledged security system installed wholesale — barely costing around a hundred thousand — yet not many people tried to replicate my way. </p><p>There was a reason for that. Ordinarily, designing a security system from discrete, unrelated pieces would leave many security gaps, weakening the defenses. Even with Emily’s assistance and my power, the best we could do was to improve its performance to somewhere near a professional system, and not surpass it. </p><p>Ironically, unlike it would have been the case just several days ago, it wasn’t the high cost of such a system that had kept me back. I had the money, but I didn’t have the contacts, so if I purchased such a comprehensive security system from an established provider, it would inevitably be filled with backdoors. </p><p>Worse, the only reason I was safe despite being in the crosshairs of two threatening organizations was their belief that I had a bigger one behind me. I was able to convince them that my lack of apparent security was about information-gathering methods they were unable to identify, together with some hidden measures. </p><p>That illusion would shatter if I purchased commercially available protections. </p><p>That was the other reason I wanted to use a mishmash of different methods across the neighborhood. Even if the Syndicate started to swipe the area openly — which they were reluctant to keep their involvement as secret as possible — they would likely assume those came from different organizations trying to keep an eye on the area. </p><p>At least, assuming they bought it. </p><p>Once the preparations were complete, I sent a message to Emily, asking for a meeting. She replied positively … along with a beautiful picture of her that she didn’t have much in terms of dressing. That was beautiful, yet ordinary. </p><p>Yet, what put a smile on my face was the next one, that it was once again from the locker room of the heroines, and she had one of the minor heroines in the background, still wearing her mask, but otherwise dressed to her underwear. </p><p>Emily was carrying a tray of drinks. I guessed that she had been ordered to bring those, and probably quite rudely as well, considering the way Emily chose to ‘punish’ the girl. Risky, but I couldn’t complain about the view. </p><p>Also, I was happy to see Emily being petty. She was a cute girl, and a nice one as well. She had also been a good person, but she wasn’t good the way Daria was, willing to risk her life and endure intense discomfort. </p><p>She was good in a more ordinary way. She lived a middle-class, ordinary life, never pushing her limits. Therefore, her goodness was a position of passivity and ignorance. </p><p>And, considering she was willing to punish her superiors in a way that violated their privacy and risked their identity, she wasn’t willing to stand that test. </p><p>It made her a good potential recruit, but one that needed to be coddled and protected rather than one that could be trusted to meet challenges on her own. If it wasn’t for two details, I wouldn’t have even dared to think of pulling her deeper into my fledgling operation. </p><p>The first one was her power. Since her power was communicating with technology, even if I recruited her fully, she didn’t need to leave the base, avoiding the stressful situations that might have challenged her fledgling and fragile conviction. </p><p>The other was my power. Emily was not someone that was particularly hard to read even without my power. And, once my observation was factored in, I was reasonably confident that I wouldn’t miss any change on her side. Of course, it was not an absolute assurance…</p><p>However, my situation was not strong enough to allow me to search for the luxury of certainties. </p><p>I continued to text Emily even as I went to our meeting location, receiving several more photos in exchange. </p><p>When I arrived at the cafe that we arranged to meet — one that I picked because of a combination of expensive menu, limited popularity at this late hour, and lack of security cameras — I picked a seat near the other end of the cafe, and sat down with my back behind the door. </p><p>It would have been dangerous, but the cafe had a few distorted mirrors that I could see via my power. That way, not only did I observe the visitors, but also I could conceal that fact. </p><p>A waitress immediately. A cute brunette with nice curves and a friendly smile, but with my power, I caught many other details. Like the fact that she was a student, learning to play violin, and having trouble making a living. </p><p>Also, not exactly well-liked in her work, considering she was assigned to the worst shift as a sole waitress. </p><p>“May I get you something, sir?” she asked. </p><p>“Just water for now,” I said, and her smile trembled, probably assuming that I was going to be a stingy customer. Combined with the understated way I dressed to avoid the attention of the Syndicate, I looked like a stingy tipper. </p><p>That would not do. The last thing I needed was for her to annoy me during my talk with Emily, which, depending on the circumstances, might require the cute waitress to ignore some public decency laws. I pulled out a hundred-dollar bill and put it on the table. “I have a date coming…” I said. </p><p>“And, if I give excellent service, you might give me that as a tip,” she completed, but not looking particularly interested. Probably because people used it as bait and switch. </p><p>“No,” I said, and put two more bills. “This is your advance. Keep your eye on our table subtly, but say nothing, and you’ll receive double the tip,” I said, happy to throw around my cash. </p><p>I was surprised just how far a few hundred dollars and some confidence had gone when combined with a confident demeanor. “R-really?” she asked. I nodded. Her doubt was understandable, as I had just given her enough to afford a nice dinner. She took the bills, and left with a blush. </p><p>How entertaining. </p><p>“Here’s your water,” she said as she placed a glass of water on the table, followed by a small tray of snacks. “And, those are on the house.” </p><p>“Thanks, sweetie,” I said, smiling just enough to make her blush. When she left, she moved so that she could watch the table from a distance, though she mostly watched me with a blush, unaware that distorted mirrors allowed me to watch her. </p><p>By coincidence, she had been called from inside when Emily arrived. I noticed Emily immediately, but I acted unaware. Instead, I continued texting her, a gentle smile on my face, like texting her was the highlight of my day. Well, not exactly a lie, though it was less about her conversational skills and more about the beautiful photos she compulsively shared to fulfill her exhibitionist kink. </p><p>She approached, and soon, the perfume I had bought for her during our last trip reached my nose. Yet, I kept looking at my phone, acting unaware of her approach. I didn’t want her to realize I was hyper-aware of my surroundings. The more I could keep hiding my approach, the better. </p><p>However, she stood behind me with a mischievous smile rather than revealing herself. Curious, I texted her again, but she had enough presence of mind to keep her phone silenced. I wondered what she was planning. </p><p>While she waited, I took in the way she dressed. She wore a pencil skirt and a blouse, complete with stockings, but that I knew from her earlier photos. Still, without posing for a picture, they were relatively tame … until she started playing with them. A quick pull ensured that the pencil skirt didn’t cover her knees but barely covered a third of her thighs, revealing the stockings she wore underneath properly, including where they ended. </p><p>Even before she started unbuttoning her crisp white blouse, I had noticed that she had gotten rid of the bra that she had been wearing during work, but only after she started unbuttoning her blouse, it reached a point that I might appreciate. </p><p>At first, it was merely deep enough to tease. Sexy, but not enough to be inappropriate in the office. Yet, she continued unbuttoning it, turning her cleavage into a deep valley that was more like a stripper costume than a secretary. </p><p>Yet, that was not the extent of her surprise. She looked around worriedly, making sure there was no one around before she pulled her blouse to the side, and took a picture that revealed her amazing breasts along with me. </p><p>Her exhibitionist tendencies were getting more exaggerated every second … not that I was complaining. </p><p>When I received the photo, I made sure to widen my gaze appropriately before I turned, catching her seductive smile. </p><p>“W-welcome,” I faked a stammer, doing my best to look captivated. Luckily, with the view in front of me, it wasn’t particularly difficult. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I woke up. </p><p>It came as a surprise, particularly the memories of my failed breakthrough were vivid in my mind. I should be dead. Just the failed breakthrough should have killed me. The damage to my body, the dragon heart invading my body to destroy my heart, out of control elemental vitae… </p><p>Even if they didn’t kill me, they should have put me in a coma that lasted months, which should have ended the same. </p><p>Yet, not only I wasn’t dead, but also I was feeling good. Excellent, even… I opened my eyes, and saw Lillian’s beautiful presence over me, her blood dripping down from her many wounds as she tried to defend me, staining my naked chest. </p><p>She had a blade of water in her right hand, swinging desperately while she used her left hand to continuously send water blades, each taking down a beast. </p><p>She was at the edge of collapse, yet she was doing her best to defend me, despite escaping being the easier option. The beasts — mostly earth-natured first-order moles, with a few second-order ones mixed in, all probably from the same colony — spilled out of the tunnels they had dug, desperately attacking me. She could have easily circled around. </p><p>I realized that she had undersold her abilities as a healer. She must have somehow healed me from the effects of my failed breakthrough and brought me back to peak condition. </p><p>I rolled back slightly before alerting her to my presence. Surprising someone in combat was never a good idea, and I wanted a chance to dodge if she tried to attack me reflexively. As I rolled back, I was surprised at just how bright the cave was. Every single detail was visible, including the expression of the wild beasts. </p><p>“I’m awake,” I said once I stood up, tensing as I prepared to roll away. My preparation came useful, but not the way I expected. </p><p>Lillian turned back, her shock palpable as she looked at me, like she had just seen someone rise from death. Well, considering the circumstances, I didn’t blame her. </p><p>What I blamed was the way she froze, leaving herself vulnerable to a rushing beast. An elementary mistake, reminding me that while she was a mage, she had never been trained for combat, and didn’t even consider how deadly the mistake was. </p><p>I threw myself forward, ready to put myself between her and the attack, lacking time to even properly reach my cores to empower myself. The attacking beast was a first-order one, and it wouldn’t kill me even without the physical boost. And, since she was such an excellent healer, she could heal me later. </p><p>But, as I dashed, expecting to barely put myself between Lillian and the attacking beast, I realized that I somehow overshot my target a great amount. The only good thing, I had been aiming at the beast, so we collided halfway. The collusion should have put me down, but instead, I continued moving. </p><p>When I stopped — somehow still on my feet — I found myself in the middle of a larger group of moles, surrounding me as they attacked. I reached for my daggers even as I prepared myself. I shouldn’t have been able to react to that attack, not without activating all four elements …</p><p>Somehow, I did. Just as I pulled my bone daggers, I dodged two attacks, and delivered a kick to the third attacking beast, a second-order earth mole, risking a broken leg. Earth beasts often had bones stronger than metal. </p><p>Still, a broken leg was better than one bitten clean off. </p><p>However, rather than shattering my bone, however, the kick sent my attacker flying. Something was wrong … very wrong. Still, the analysis of what was wrong could wait until I dealt with all the attackers. I looked at Lillian, still losing blood while she watched me, shocked. I didn’t blame her. I wanted to find a mirror so I could look at myself the same way. However, that could wait. </p><p>“Heal yourself, and stay in a defensive stance,” I said as I crouched down, two bone daggers ready, and attacked. With the several tunnels spilling earth-natured beasts, I could see at least a dozen second-order beasts, and more than a hundred first-order beasts. </p><p>It was a shocking number, enough to give a group of mages pause, and threaten a small town. Yet, I danced among them, cutting, stabbing, slicing. And, once a quarter of them had been slain, the rest started to escape. </p><p>My breath didn’t even speed up. </p><p>“Well, that was fun,” I said, then I realized the blood on my skin was disappearing, being absorbed. Lillian was still healing her wounds, but nowhere near as efficient as I expected. She was a novice healer as she had said. Which was not a problem, except a novice healer couldn’t have saved me after my breakthrough had gone awry. </p><p>Interesting. I looked at Lillian and noticed that there was a thick cut in her left hand, right in her palm, one that was far too smooth to be done by a beast, yet refused to heal completely. </p><p>I doubted that it was an accidental cut. </p><p>My mind immediately went in a new direction. Blood magic. The fabled lost art of druids disappeared after the Republic had killed most of the high-ranking members during the initial invasion or subsequent rebellions, their mysterious abilities of blood and forests lost … or so everyone thought. </p><p>Suddenly, I had a better idea why they had gone all that trouble kidnapping Lillian. </p><p>“How long have I been unconscious?” I asked, not giving her any indication that I realized her use of blood magic. She clearly wanted to keep it a secret, and I understood her rationale. I would have done the same with the dragon heart if the situation hadn’t forced my hand. </p><p>She used to help me. That was all I needed to know for the moment. </p><p>“I don’t know. A few minutes,” she said, which surprised me. Even with her healing, I expected it to be longer. It was good news, though it required a change of plans. My plan, before a dozen unexpected factors had ruined it, was to defend the place with the power of a four-element mage, and once opportunity presented itself, use earth magic to dig a tunnel to escape. </p><p>But, the new situation was better than I had any right to hope. We could actually evacuate the cave before the mages or the third-order beasts could arrive to discover our location. </p><p>While she continued healing herself, I patted my body, still unable to believe my performance. Her healing spell must have been even more incredible than I expected. No wonder legions had hunted every druid they could find. They wouldn’t allow the power of such entities to spread. </p><p>“You can stop radiating mana now. I have enough to heal myself. We don’t need any more beasts finding us,” Lillian warned me. </p><p>I froze, realizing that it was the case. I was radiating mana, but I didn’t realize it because I had been too distracted by … well, still being alive. </p><p>I closed my eyes, focusing inward, not sure what to find. I wanted to believe that the sequence with the dragon heart was merely a wild dream, but it was not. </p><p>Instead, it had turned into a hollow, misshapen sphere that had expanded and contracted with every heartbeat, radiating mana to fill my body. No wonder I had been leaking mana. </p><p>I didn’t pay much attention to it, because I didn’t know where to begin. Dragon hearts were supposed to be unique pieces of crystals with the ability to radiate mana whenever they had contact with blood, and nothing else. </p><p>They weren’t supposed to encase a mage’s heart. </p><p>It was a mystery, one that required months, maybe years to solve, so I stopped paying attention to it. There was nothing I could do. Instead, I turned my attention to my elemental cores. They were supposed to be spheres, and the single puncture I had dealt with to extract vitae was supposed to be recovered. </p><p>They looked more like punctured water skins: dried, misshapen, and most importantly, empty. There was no evidence of where the vitae they had been supposed to be holding had gone … but I didn’t need evidence to guess that the mystical crystal around my heart was responsible for it. </p><p>After all, only after I had merged the four elemental vitae into one, did the dragon heart react to settle around my heart. </p><p>Another mystery that I lacked time to control. Instead, I focused on the mana that I had been radiating, and focused on keeping it in my body. It worked, but the dragon heart continued to spill mana, far more intense than its usual </p><p>Luckily, whatever happened to my body to make me faster and stronger also increased the amount of mana I could hold in my body significantly, or I would have exploded in minutes. After those improvements, I could probably suppress it for several hours, maybe even a day if I was lucky… </p><p>When I opened my eyes again, Lillian was free of her wounds, except the one in her palm that refused to heal, and looked at me with no small amount of shock, clearly struggling to understand how I was alive. </p><p>I didn’t blame her. I thought the same way. Unfortunately, the situation was far too dangerous to have a talk about it. </p><p>We needed to move, or we would get caught in a fight between third-order beasts and a considerable number of mages.</p>",

    "content": "<p>As much as the kiss and the implied promise made me more excited, as I tightened my grip around the dragon heart with one hand, my wild heartbeat was about my upcoming breakthrough. I was about to risk everything for a hasty breakthrough …</p><p>But, I didn’t have any other choice but to push forward recklessly, and use a method that even the crazy old man had treated reticently. </p><p>Breakthrough was a straightforward affair for a single-element mage. Not easy or safe, but simple in concept. Slowly feed the elemental core with more mana without letting it grow and adapt, apply pressure from outside to keep it small, until it inevitably cracked, and the elemental concept it had been holding spread into the body of the apprentice mage. </p><p>Of course, an elemental core was more of a mana construct than a physical organ, and the energy it contained spread into the mage's body, giving a mage the ability to connect with the elements of nature. Once that process was completed, the mage could use mana to connect the elements outside his body, feeding, controlling, and weaponizing their element with the ease they breathed. </p><p>The initial spread and the organs affected determined the mage's potential. Most chose the heart, as it gave the greatest overall improvement, and allowed the strongest spellcasting, but different organs had their own advantages. </p><p>A healer might choose to prioritize his hands, while a scout might prioritize his eyes, prioritizing passive improvements over spell power, but such choices were rare. Most mages started with the heart, and slowly created more of that compressed energy and attuned more of their bodies with mana. </p><p>Of course, that energy had been mana in the past, but after staying trapped and compressed in an elemental core for years, it turned into something different. Most called it elemental vitae, but quite a few people called it ichor — though never in the earshot of priests, who didn’t appreciate such heresy. </p><p>Ichor was the blood of the gods, and even for a mage, daring to compare themselves to Jupiter, Neptune, and other divine entities was daring … even if the divine hadn’t walked on Earth for centuries. </p><p>I took a deep breath, focusing on the present. The breakthrough for a four-element apprentice was a far more difficult and delicate process. The reason was simple. The elemental vitae didn’t interact well with each other. </p><p>That was why the only acceptable breakthrough method for a four-element mage was a sequential approach. Choose one element, overwhelm the core, shuttle the vitae into an extremity, and keep it there before breaking the second one. The usual pattern was head, legs, stomach, and heart, the heart always being activated the last. </p><p>Then, the mage would spend months carefully creating borders between them to prevent those energies from mixing. It was the safe approach — for a very loose definition of safe — but it was also laborious and limiting. It shackled the four-four element mage to the rank of mage, never to rise to the rank of sorcerer. </p><p>Still, it was a good deal for most. The breakthrough to the rank of sorcerer was filled with secrets and dangers. There was a reason people called it a minor apotheosis. </p><p>Four-element mages couldn’t rival sorcerers, but they had an overwhelming advantage against the other mages, making it an excellent choice for rich and daring minor nobles. </p><p>Even that process could go wrong in many ways. </p><p>Fire and water were a combustive combination, while earth and air rejected each other wildly. Those weren’t the only problems of vitae conflict. Earth absorbed water, air fed water, and fire tainted earth … at least, when mages had limited themselves to more traditional interpretations all the time. </p><p>The vitae from the core carried years of conceptual understanding of the apprentice. My grandfather had spent years and many painful lessons explaining that, for someone like me, who had used his cores for alternative understandings all the, even those reactions was not a given. </p><p>Which meant, his crazy theory was even more troubling. Unlike the traditional breakthrough, his technique didn’t require a lot of mana, as fitting for an emergency technique. The old man probably didn’t envision a sequence of events he had given me the dragon heart, yet I was still forced to break in a hurry. </p><p>Not that I blamed him for that assumption. The sequence of events that led me here was … exceptional. </p><p>I took a deep breath, and spoke. “It’s time for a breakthrough.” It was not just to inform Lillian that I was starting, but to gather my courage. </p><p>Then, I punctured my finger, and let the dragon heart absorb a drop of blood. Its multicolored glow spread in the cave, joining the blue glow of her spheres. This time, I didn’t bother containing the mana. I didn’t need to. The commotion from it was nothing compared to what was about to follow. </p><p>I gathered some of that mana, turning them into four identical needles in my body, and aligned them against my elemental cores, ready to puncture. I was betting a lot on my grandfather’s theory. If it was wrong, I would damage my cores, making it impossible for them to generate the necessary pressure to crack in the future. </p><p>“Focus,” I muttered, ignoring those thoughts. I needed to treat it like a fight. In a fight, second-guessing the tactics was a cardinal sin, as a momentary pause could prove fatal. My unorthodox breakthrough was like that … only worse. </p><p>I punctured the four cores at the same time.</p><p>The pain that followed was hard to describe, but I welcomed it. I was used to suffering, and it gave me something better to focus on than self-doubt. I closed my eyes, focusing on my cores, and four drops of vitae that followed, their feeling impossible to describe. </p><p>Yet, as I truly felt them for the first time, I understood why some dared to call it tainted ichor. The feeling was divine. Just their free existence allowed me to connect with my surroundings, feeling not just the mana, but the existence of the elements. It was beautiful and scary at the same time… </p><p>I ignored the feeling as I focused on the four drops. Earth, fire, air, and water, each carrying the distinctive tinge of their nature and more. I ignored every single nugget of wisdom people had advised, and instead pulled them all to my heart, forcibly colliding them right at the center of my heart. </p><p>The pain that spread was indescribable. My heart burned and froze at the same time, expanding and contracting. </p><p>Yet, along with the pain, came an understanding. I felt my nascent connection with the world shift. It was another hard-to-describe sensation. As if, previously, I was looking at the world from a broken, stained window. No, four stained windows, each distorting the view in a different way, forcing me to guess the reality of the picture …</p><p>As the four different vitae merged, the windows broke, giving me a glimpse of something much greater, beautiful, and terrible at the same time. </p><p>“T-that crazy old man, he’s right,” I stammered as I prepared to force another drop while I started connecting with everything at the same time. He was right. Developing only one element, and treating them as distinct entities crippled the true potential of the mages. Only by merging the four, one could truly coordinate with the world. </p><p>Of course, I still needed to survive. </p><p>The first attempt to merge the elemental vitae had succeeded, but it was not without cost. I could feel the presence of several internal wounds while blood forced itself through my throat. </p><p>I was glad that beasts already started to react, making Lillian too busy defending me to pay attention. The last thing I needed was a healing spell to break my balance. Even the slightest external influence could be deadly —</p><p>As I pulled for mana, the dragon heart suddenly turned into a liquid, and before I could react, seeped into my skin. I could feel it moving through my veins, forcing me to redefine the meaning of pain. Even the conflict of four vitae in my heart was nothing in comparison. </p><p>A desperate, foreign cry reached my ear. Intellectually, I knew that it was mine, but somehow, it didn’t feel like that. It felt alien … like everything except the liquified dragon heart climbing up my veins, burning everything behind. </p><p>I wondered if I was imagining the smell of burning flesh… though not for long. The dragon heart continued to climb through my veins, but it didn’t spread, moving in a determined manner. </p><p>And, settled right into the center. Then, there was no pain. I felt like I was about to die … when I felt Lillian cast a healing spell on me. </p><p>Then, darkness. </p>",

    "content": "<p>The potential arrival of a sorcerer made me rethink my strategy. My initial trick with the dress turned useless. It would be enough to trick a bunch of undisciplined pirates, but it wouldn’t work against professionals. </p><p>Especially since they were determined to catch Lillian. Their determination was not in doubt. Otherwise, they wouldn’t send three ships and fought against the pirates just to get her. Too bad we didn’t know why, or we might have used it some way. If I knew they wanted her unharmed, for example, we might have created some kind of hostage situation to get away freely. </p><p>Unfortunately, I suspected that they wanted her for some mystical reason — anything else didn’t justify the effort — so it was hard to guess exactly which condition they needed her. </p><p>Worse, with such dedication, they wouldn’t stop until either they had found a body, or explored every inch of the island to ascertain she couldn’t be found. The way they had deployed their search parties made sure of it. </p><p>I had been planning to trigger some fights between the search parties and the third-order beasts that were living on the island. When a mage and a third-order beast that could use magic externally fought, the smart bet was always the beast. However, that equation changed when mages had professional soldiers to support them and distract the beast… Especially when the mage had other mages to support them. </p><p>When I saw them from the cropping, I had also seen the search parties they were preparing to deploy, lined on the shore. Each group had a leader who was dressed the same as the mages I killed, marking them as mages, supported by sixteen armored soldiers. </p><p>There were six such groups, preparing to move. </p><p>“It looks like I’m going to make a stupid move,” I muttered. It was one of the things that my grandfather had taught me, with strict instructions never to try unless it was the last resort during a disaster. </p><p>The current situation certainly qualified. </p><p>I ran back to the cave. It was the best location, and Lillian’s presence would help significantly. I needed some support while I was taking such a risky step. </p><p>When I burst into the cave, I met with a glorious scene, one that forced me to turn my back immediately. “Sorry, it’s an emergency. I didn’t expect for you to be bathing … or have a bath here,” I said, giving Lillian a chance to put on her clothes back before I turned. Even clothed, her skin glistened under the blue light radiating from a sphere of water, the result of a spell. </p><p>The fact that she was wearing my shirt added another layer to it. </p><p>Her blush was visible even under the low light, but her shy gaze seemed to carry a suggestive question, her blue eyes with a soft glint. It would be a lie to say I wouldn’t have been tempted by it if the situation we were facing weren’t as dangerous. </p><p>”I thought it was better to have some water in the cave to use as a weapon if a beast attacked. It’s not just for comfort,” she explained hurriedly, then my words registered. “An … emergency?” she asked, still shy. </p><p>“Yes. I’m going to break through, and I need your help.” </p><p>She sighed. “Not exactly an emergency, then,” she said, slightly frustrated. “At least my kidnappers were tricked by my dress. It served me well,” She looked around. “While I don’t want to spend a month in this cave, but I would —” </p><p>“No,” I cut her off. “Your kidnappers are still here, and they are preparing to search the island,” I said. “That’s why it’s an emergency. I need to complete my breakthrough in a few hours, not a few weeks.” </p><p>“But that’s impossible. Even a normal mage needs a week at a minimum, and that’s with things going as well as predicted. You have four cores to balance while shattering them,” she said. </p><p>“All good points,” I said as I walked toward the center of the cave, carefully examining the ground. Preferably, I needed to find a solid ground. My breakthrough would inevitably attract the beasts. The last thing I needed was one to burst right under me. </p><p>She paused, watching me. “Do you have some kind of secret method known only for Patrician families?” she asked, her tone hopeful. </p><p>“My grandfather taught me one. The theory is solid, and I see no reason that it wouldn’t work.” </p><p>She froze. “The t-theory is solid,” she stammered. “What do you mean? Someone else tried it before, right?” </p><p>“No, it’s one of my grandfather’s theories. And, he was a genius of elemental theory. You have seen how good I can fight as a mere apprentice. It’s all because of his teachings. I have full confidence that it’ll work.” </p><p>As I explained it, however, I neglected one very important detail. My grandfather warned me many times about the dangers of the method, and he was the man who thought throwing a teenager with a broken arm armed only with a dagger against a pack of hungry wolves was a character-building experience. </p><p>I neglected to mention that detail to Lillian. If I failed, I would die, and she could make a decision between a last stand and surrendering. </p><p>“Of course, there’s a chance that I won’t be in fighting condition after the breakthrough. If that happens, you have to decide how to act. Since they are determined to take you alive, you might think of leaving me and surrendering. Once I start to break through, a lot of beasts will attack us. It’ll be dangerous.” </p><p>“And, what happens when you’re alone?” she said. </p><p>“One good thing about my grandfather’s method is that I will be able to fight during it. I will  be able to handle a few beasts that attack me.” </p><p>“Then, there’s no need to surrender, is there? Why mention it,” she asked sharply. Damn, I had hoped that she missed that. My mistake. She had been rather agreeable the last night … but a combination of exhaustion, mortal danger, and repeated shocks was hardly ideal. </p><p>“Well, there’s a chance that it would be worse,” I said. A very big chance. “I wanted to give you the option to surrender. You don’t have to risk yourself with me when there’s another option.” </p><p>She paused, thinking of my words. “Would you have surrendered if you were in my place?”</p><p>“Do you want to hear the truth, or a comforting lie?” I asked. She didn’t answer, but her stiff nod clued me still. “I would kill myself before letting them take me. The kidnapping, combined with the secrecy they had been aiming doesn’t create a nice picture. There are many options that would make death a pleasant alternative.” </p><p>“And, you would bet your life on it?” she said. </p><p>“Certainly,” I answered. “Even without the suspicious points, I wouldn’t have let them take me alive. What’s life without freedom.” </p><p>She stayed silent while I continued checking the cave even more in detail, trying to pick the most ideal location. In the end, I picked a spot near the backend of the cave, toward the left, with a thick stone floor. </p><p>Then, I pulled the dragon heart from its box, my hand trembling as I pulled it out. I was determined to use that method to break, but that didn’t make the prospect any less daunting. I took a shaky breath, trying to bring down my out-of-control heartbeat, but it didn’t work. </p><p>“Last chance,” I told her. “I’m going to collapse the tunnel before we start, so there’s no turning back if you stay. Even if I’m successful, the commotion will be huge, and it’ll trigger a big fight. The only question is whether the beasts or the people will discover our location first.” </p><p>She looked at me, her expression impossible to scrutinize, and then, without saying anything, she started climbing the steep tunnel. </p><p>It was for the best, and there was no need to be disappointed. Yet, my emotions didn’t listen to me. Barely a few seconds after she walked the tunnel, I felt a flare of magic, and the tunnel collapsed. “At least she helped me one last time,” I sighed as I closed my eyes, trying to focus on my cores…</p><p>And opened them back right on when I heard footsteps, and watched Lillian appear at the entrance, dragging a large sphere of water with her to add in the bath. It overflowed, covering most of the floor. It made the ground muddy, but it also helped her to fight much better. A welcome tradeoff. </p><p>“You look surprised, why?” she said, her smirk wide. </p><p>“Well played,” I said, unable to keep my smile down as she walked toward me. </p><p>“So, any idea how long it’ll take,” she said as she stood in front of me, the water following her movements. She looked far more competent when she wasn’t at the edge of collapse. </p><p>“If it wasn’t for the dragon heart, at least three hours. With it … I have no idea. Somewhere between fifteen minutes and an hour, but even that’s not certain.” </p><p>She turned back and gave me a pointed glare. “Why do I feel that it’s not as safe as you implied,” she said. </p><p>I shrugged. “It’s not like we have a lot of options. Now, I’m starting.” </p><p>She nodded, then paused. “A second,” she said as she turned toward me and grabbed my chin. Before I could process it, her lips landed on mine, giving me a gentle kiss, one that disappeared just as quickly. “For luck,” she whispered, her blush beautiful. “Survive, and there’ll be more.” </p><p>I did feel luckier. </p>",

    "title": "Dominating the Boss 61",
    "content": "<p>Once the ‘lap dance’ had ended, the game had settled into a new rhythm. As the ’drunk’ boss, I continued to play badly, but I made sure to win enough hands to stay in the game. </p><p>Initially, I had a long, careful plan in mind, where I would be juggling wins and losses while I tangled the hopes of victory in front of Mark and Charlie, dangling the opportunity for grand victory in front of them before pulling it back, making them escalate more even when it meant the sacrifice of their significant others. </p><p>However, even after that lap dance intermission, things started to go in a different direction. After Mark had made Umi give me a lap dance — at least, after he did enough to look responsible for it — the aura between the two was getting more and more tense. </p><p>Mark gave Charlie an easy target to blame for his problems, which made Charlie start targeting him. Mark didn’t feel the same way toward Charlie, but he was reflexively opportunistic, unable to resist the temptation of taking another step forward. </p><p>The earlier lap dance had somewhat solidified the rules. Any victory would save their significant other from my lap, and their streak of victories would keep them there. Meanwhile, any win from me would get rid of a piece of clothing, which the girls could ill afford to lose. </p><p>The rules incentivized them to win as much as the money, while they ignored their ‘drunk’ boss. Their supposed alliance was already gone, and the speedy way they consumed their hard liqueur wasn’t exactly making them better decision-makers. </p><p>It was not like how I envisioned it, but I wasn’t complaining. There were worse ways to spend a night than repeatedly switching the lap dances between two beautiful women under the jealous glares of their significant others.</p><p>“ … Suck it, Mark. I win,” Charlie growled as he looked at Mark. He was angry, but not enough to cover up his drunk state. “Umi, leave the seat of honor to our dear hostess.” </p><p>“Wow, great burn, honey,” Umi commented sarcastically as she got off my lap. </p><p>“Nice work,” I said as I slapped her ass, enjoying the way it jiggled despite her tight skirt. Not a lot, just enough. The feeling of her tight ass was almost as beautiful as Charlie’s victorious expression disappear. However, the fact that his angry glare pointed at Mark rather than me didn’t stop being funny. </p><p>Meanwhile, Umi was glaring as well, but her target was Tiffany, who was looking smug. “You need to be faster, sweetie, it’s my turn,” she said as she pushed Umi away, and sat on my lap. And, unlike Umi, she made sure to take me in. </p><p>Umi didn’t dare to do so when she was facing the other way, afraid of giving up the whole game. She was coming along nicely, but she wasn’t like Tiffany who could smile without strain even as she took me in slowly. </p><p>It wasn’t the first time. For the last few hands, Tiffany was making sure that every man won and lost in turn, which made my dancer change repeatedly, teasing Umi every time. </p><p>Fixing a game of poker was not hard when the players were drunk enough to notice just how much their significant others were enjoying what was supposed to be their punishment. Or that the recipients of those dances had their pants down the whole time. </p><p>Therefore, they didn’t also notice Tiffany fixing the games to keep things going. </p><p>“Why are you so smug? It’s going to be my turn soon anyway,” Umi whispered when she noticed Tiffany’s smug grin while she moved on my lap, unafraid of her fiancee hearing. </p><p>Luckily for her, Charlie was too focused on the next hand to hear her careless whisper. Not because of the risk to her relationship — no, that was already on life support, condemned to an eventual demise — but because I would have punished her if she ruined our fun. </p><p>She would have probably enjoyed that punishment as much as I did, but that was another topic. </p><p>“Oh, we will see,” Tiffany said smugly, while Umi just nodded seriously. </p><p>My eyes widened. Only then did I realize Umi was unaware that Tiffany had been fixing the game all along? Sometimes, her gullibility truly surprised me. Tiffany seemed to be equally surprised by that admission, but the devious smirk that followed was not good news for Umi. </p><p>For me, they were excellent news. </p><p>The game continued slowly while Tiffany made some quick changes to the deck while she continued to move back and forth, somehow managing to hide the intense fucking she was receiving as a mere dance. However, she did not bother to play the demure wife being punished as she moved, moaning. </p><p>“Honey, a little quieter, maybe,” Mark finally said. </p><p>“Are you trying to … int-interfere with my reward,” I commented, deliberately with an excessive slurring to imply I might fall asleep soon. </p><p>“Not at all, sir,” Mark said immediately. He was frustrated by my intervention, but he didn’t dare to contradict me, well, ever,, but it was even more pronounced in my fake-drunk state. He was afraid of triggering me after going to all the trouble to keep me entertained. </p><p>“Ex-excellent,” I slurred while Tiffany laughed, pressing her back against my chest. </p><p>The game continued, and Tiffany laughed sardonically. “Oh, sir. You won,” Tiffany commented even as she reached and pulled her skirt free, and put it on the desk while she continued to ‘dance’. She went for the skirt for two reasons. First, the table was conveniently on the way to keep her body hidden from the other two, avoiding a pesky pause to the game. </p><p>It also allowed Umi to watch the show uninterrupted from the side. Yet, the real attack came when the next three games concluded, and Charlie won all three of them. “I’m amazing, honey,” Charlie declared, missing that his victories didn’t bring any joy to his fiancee. </p><p> “I’m so unlucky, that my husband is a poor poker player,” Tiffany, but her gaze was on Umi as she spoke, playing the earlier angle, making me wonder how long it would take for Umi to realize she had been rigging the game. </p><p>But, it was clearly not immediately, so I decided to heat things up a little more. I let my hands slide down, cupping her ass while she continued to take me to her depths with her elegant dance. </p><p>Two more victories for Charlie followed, giving him a perpetual smile, not noticing Umi was frowning deeper than Mark. Then, another victory for me. Tiffany could have removed her transparent green visor, but she chose to keep that in place, and instead focused on her vest, which had nothing underneath. </p><p>However, once she unbuttoned a button, she caught Charlie’s gaze, and smirked. “Unfortunately, it’s only for the winners,” she said as she slid out, and changed her position on my lap in a smooth turn that would have made experienced strippers die of jealousy so that she was facing me. </p><p>Then, she removed her vest in one smooth move, smashed her naked tits against my chest, and took me in once again. “Umi, sweetie, do you mind dealing the next hand,” she said while she put both hands on my neck. </p><p>“Sure,” she said, and Umi started leading the game. Meanwhile, Tiffany grabbed my neck and started rocking her hips aggressively, likely assuming that Umi would cheat, therefore, stop her fun. She didn’t want her fun to end quickly. </p><p>However, I watched the game as much as I could muster, knowing that Umi wouldn’t do that, so the ending was pretty much undecided. So, just as Tiffany was reaching her climax, Charlie started celebrating his victory. “I win.” </p><p>“R-really,” Tiffany gasped, her voice thick with pleasure as the news surprised her enough to make her speak even when she was at the edge of a climax. </p><p>“It’s just a cold streak. Don’t worry, I’ll win soon,” Mark said as he poured himself another drink, feeling emasculated by his loss. </p><p>“Sure, sure,” Tiffany replied, not even bothering to register what he said, her voice thick with pleasure. I was glad that both men were rather lightweight, and their minds were too cloudy to understand what had been going on. </p><p>She didn’t pay any attention to the game as Umi distributed another set of cards, focusing on her upcoming climax, which arrived while Umi was flipping open the fourth card. Tiffany bit my shoulder as she tried to keep her moans down. It was not entirely successful, but it had been enough to avoid the suspicions of the two drunks. </p><p>It wasn’t enough to avoid Umi’s jealous glare. Therefore, when the game ended, and Mark declared his victory with a small dance, Umi wasn’t feeling particularly happy after failing to interrupt Tiffany’s climax. </p><p>Tiffany didn’t reach her vest as she shifted to her chair, instead selecting to twist her chair and use its back to cover her tits. “Thanks, Umi, you freed me… Now it’s your turn,” Tiffany teased. </p><p>Umi and Charlie frowned at the same time, but the engaged couple had wildly different reasons for it.</p>",
