    "content": "<p>Hi everyone. </p><p>As the story reaches chapter 79, it marks the end of book 1 where the main focus is showing our 'hero' grow from an unlucky passerby to an ambitious young man trying to survive against much greater forces in a complicated world. </p><p>The second book will focus on the offensive against the Syndicate and the Guild - along with lots of fun scenes. Chapter 79 is essentially an epilog for the book 1 and a prolog for the book 2. </p><p>However, since there's a lot of details I need to decide, I won't start posting the book immediately. There's a lot of details that needs to be decided for the story to continue developing the world and the characters in a fun way. </p><p>Instead, Blacksmith versus the System (A new story) will take its place as my 10$ exclusive story for the next few months. </p><p>Happy reading. </p>",

    "content": "<p>It was already afternoon. And I was lounging on Emily’s bed. She was next to me, sleeping soundly, exhausted with everything. Unfortunately, before I could join her, my phone buzzed. A message, from Daria. </p><p>‘We need to meet. Be in my apartment in an hour.’</p><p>‘How rude? What if I don’t have time?’ I wrote back. While acting like that against her was dangerous, it was better than changing my attitude after the last night. </p><p>‘You will be here!’ she wrote, no doubt trying to sound intimidating. Unfortunately for her, it was difficult to do so. </p><p>‘Not unless I get an advance payment,’ I wrote back. </p><p>‘What kind of payment? Weren’t you supposed to be rich?’ she replied. </p><p>‘I have a different kind of payment in mind. Why don’t you start it by sending a beautiful photo of your amazing tits, a little advance payment.’ </p><p>‘You’re a bastard. How dare you. I won’t send you a nude,’ she answered.</p><p>‘Then, I won’t come to the meeting,’ I wrote back, unable to hide my smirk.  </p><p>‘Right now?’ she said back. </p><p>‘I won’t even get dressed before you send the first picture,’ I said, deliberately pushing her. It was a good way to play to the character she was familiar with, while also showing the importance of the meeting. If it wasn’t important, she wouldn’t have accepted that quickly. </p><p>After a decent delay, my phone buzzed, showing a beautiful selfie from her. Interestingly, she was in the bathroom, with the door firmly closed. I could see her looking there hesitantly. </p><p>She wasn’t alone. </p><p>‘Beautiful enough to make me stand up, but keep them coming,’ I said. But, annoying her wasn’t the main objective of that message. No, the hesitance she displayed as she glanced toward the door revealed that she was not alone. More photos meant I could glean more, which would make me more prepared. </p><p>‘Maybe later,’ she wrote. </p><p>‘Why, do you have something more important?’ I asked. </p><p>‘Y-yeah, I need to take a shower, or I’ll be late,’ she answered, which was a terrible excuse. </p><p>‘No harm in multitasking, send one while taking a shower,’ I wrote back, imagining her shocked expression. She was truly terrible under pressure.  </p><p>She didn’t send anything immediately, but I didn’t let it bother me even as I took a quick shower and prepared, wondering who was her other guests. </p><p>I didn’t fear an ambush even for a moment, which was one benefit of cooperating with someone who could smash me easily. She had no need to trap me to get rid of me. </p><p>However, once I stepped out of the shower, I was surprised to get a picture of her while she was in the shower. She must have used the same excuse for her other guest, which, considering her general personality, made me believe that I was about to meet with Rosa, her mysterious leader who I only knew from the messages I had read. </p><p>“Interesting,” I said even as I woke Emily up. “I need to leave, but before, I need your help,” I said before I gave her several instructions. Then, I dressed and left. </p><p>While talking, I received a few more pictures from Daria, each more daring than the last. Her face was beautiful. More importantly, despite her frustrated messages, there was no hiding her arousal. Not too shocking, as while the situation that led to it might be an accident — at least, from her perspective — but there was no doubt that she enjoyed the experience. </p><p>‘Happy?’ she wrote after another sexy photo. </p><p>‘For now. See you in forty-five minutes,’ I wrote back, already walking. Her apartment wasn’t too far away, but there was a reason I started to walk early. </p><p>I wanted to make sure that they couldn’t trace me back to Emily’s apartment by tracing back my steps through public security cameras. Luckily, with my power, finding a spot to change my disguise had been easy. </p><p>So, I walked, no matter how much I wanted to sleep more. My mind wandered toward my plan. With her allies arriving in the town, I had a feeling that things would speed up. I needed to put my plans into operation as well. </p><p>I wasn’t exactly happy with the need to infiltrate a building filled with heroes, but this last meeting changed things. I had a feeling that she would save that imprisoned heroine sooner than later, and I wanted to be prepared.</p><p>Refusing her was not advisable. </p><p>Perils with trying to collaborate with someone who could play tennis while using a truck as a ball.</p><p>At least I didn’t need to fear an ambush. If she wanted to capture me, she would, and there was nothing I could do to prevent. </p><p>As I walked the unnecessarily complex route I picked, I started thinking about the other steps of my plan, including the details of our latest achievements. </p><p>My false backstory was a part of it. </p><p>The preparations we made hadn’t been limited to making money and creating a potential infiltration identity. Last night, I also asked Emily’s help to create a digital presence. Nothing much, just a few scattered mentions of me as a mercenary, hoping that it would look like I was a small-time mercenary that used a second-rate hacker to remove my digital presence, but inevitably leaving clues. </p><p>We even created a secret website to get job requests. Not that I expected it to ever be actually useful. </p><p>The other part of my preparation was to create a shopping list, and even make several orders. At this point, I still didn’t have the plan to save her — other than revealing the exact location and letting Daria loose, which was workable but not ideal — but it felt a better idea to get a sense of all the gear I could purchase first before making the plan based on what I could buy, now that I had some legitimate funds that wasn’t entirely cash. </p><p>Of course, that didn’t begin to solve the problem. My funds had increased, but also they were split between hundreds of different companies and shell companies. Even the combination of our powers didn’t give me the ability to easily move those funds around without triggering all kinds of checks. And, since I didn’t have any security clearance, I couldn’t purchase anything dangerous in the first place. </p><p>But, that didn’t mean the money was useless. They were a great deal of stuff that could be purchased, from bulletproof windows to support materials that I could use in the basement into a real bunker. </p><p>“Now, the delivery,” I muttered even as I started checking the buildings for sale, before identifying a nice house that had been demolished by yet another fight. The fact that it was destroyed was critical for two reasons. It meant that it was cheap enough to buy without combining the accounts of multiple companies. </p><p>It also meant that the constant delivery of construction materials wouldn’t be suspicious. </p><p>Was that a lot of work, certainly. Unfortunately, I couldn’t alert the Syndicate by suddenly ordering a truck of material to my bar. It might force them to act. </p><p>The house was an ideal delivery location. It was far away from the warehouse, making it unlikely that the Syndicate would notice the purchase. Yet, it was close enough that Tara could dig another tunnel there and carry the necessary material. </p><p>“Now, the necessary equipment,” I muttered as I checked some of the civilian-grade construction material, the most expensive I could afford without triggering any kind of red flag. Luckily, one benefit of the constant battle of the supers, an emergency material delivery for construction material was hardly surprising. </p><p>I even asked Tara to start working on the tunnel, marking the completion of another stage. </p><p>Ordering a more offensive arsenal was more difficult. Ordinary guns and explosives weren’t too difficult, but I didn’t think about acquiring those. Unlike any other gang, I lacked the numbers and reliable hires to use it. Emily was not suited for combat, and Tara didn’t need any weapon in the first place. </p><p>But, with a potential raid toward the guild, I changed my mind. I might not need extra guns — though a decent sniper rifle might be useful — but some explosives might give me the edge I needed. Luckily, a quick check gave me a lot of options, particularly since I was more interested in creating a commotion than causing damage. </p><p>No need to turn into a mass murderer. </p><p>I had a safe house, a supply chain for secret deliveries, a new secret fund, and a rough list of weapons. </p><p>Now, I was ready for the meeting. </p>",

    "title": "A Gamer Adventure - Epilogue Final",
    "content": "<p>“You’re late,” a trembling, ethereal voice greeted me the moment I stepped into the grand room that had been functioning as a prison and the core of the System for a long time, surrounded by a ridiculous amount of wards that were mostly put by the Eternals. However, those wards had some changes since they changed ownership. It was still functioning as a prison, but I had done my best to make it more comfortable. </p><p>I might not trust the goddess imprisoned in here, but that didn’t mean I had to needlessly antagonize her. </p><p>“Sorry, I had things to do, planes to conquer,” I said with a deliberately casual shrug as I looked at the empty room, then conjured myself a crystal chair, and a larger, more ornate chair for her, enough to classify as a throne. With the very limited interaction I had, I could feel that she was a dangerous, prideful being, and playing with that didn’t bother me. </p><p>It wouldn’t be the first time I played the servant for some advantage.  </p><p>“You have my offer,” she replied, still a disembodied voice. “Free me, and I will reveal the secrets you’re seeking.” </p><p>“Unfortunately, my goddess, that’s not really possible under the circumstances. You’re too dangerous as a variable to be let go under those circumstances,” I said, which was mostly true, and the slight exaggeration was another move to feed her ego some more. “Would you like to have our negotiations face to face, or insist on staying like this.” </p><p>“Fine,” the voice answered, and then an energy started to gather from all around the room. It wasn’t just the Divine Spark, but also a soul, spread with it. A spark that was similar to my Tantric spark. Similar, but not the same. </p><p>She appeared in the form of a woman in her thirties, wearing a crown of flowers … and nothing else. She radiated a motherly aura and an incredible aura of sexiness at the same time, an aura that she brought to bear against me. </p><p>I could have resisted, but I chose not to. Dealing with such a proud being with a bruised ego was a tricky thing. When her smirk widened slightly, I prepared myself for a magical blow. Insisted, she just spoke. </p><p>“I should have known that picking a mortal woman to carry my powers would have backfired, and created an abomination,” she commented. “Who would have thought that the madwoman would give her  life trying to imbue you with the power of creation.” </p><p>I let my smile slip away, and it wasn’t entirely a role. Her words implied that my mother died when I was born, meaning my mother — and possibly my father — wasn’t the real one. That part, I didn’t care much, as being treated as a burden for most of my life didn’t trigger a lot of loving feelings. I appreciated their effort to find me a decent career, and made sure to send a lot of benefits to their side now that I was in power, but that was it. </p><p>The idea of a woman I had never known sacrificing her life for me, no doubt granting me with the abilities of Tantric. </p><p>“I’m guessing that’s why my System started to have problems once I got stronger,” I said. “It’s because your power of creation is not supposed to be wielded by a man,” I commented. Observing her for months, I had determined that to be the case.</p><p>Her powers and mine functioned very differently, which was also why I kept her as a ‘guest’. She had enough potential to scare the gods when they were the height of their powers, before Eternals were even a concern. I wasn’t ready to take such a risk.  </p><p>“Of course,” she said with a scoff, her disdain clear. “Power of creation is a primal power, even more ancient than the elemental powers. It’s inherently linked to fertility, and never meant to be wielded by a male. You’re an abomination.” </p><p>“I would prefer a nicer word. Exceptional, maybe,” I replied, though my frustration was mostly manufactured. One of the benefits of being confident in my power. </p><p>She chuckled. “Too bad that others would disagree. The Power of Creation is already treated as a dangerous power. And, with those upstarts defeated and escaped, it’s only a matter of time before others discover the pathways to your tiny universe,” she said, her smirk wide. “And, once they did, they will treat you as an abomination.” </p><p>I sighed. “I’m guessing that it’s not just about mocking me. You have something in mind.” </p><p>“Let me free, and help me regain my power,” she replied. “As long as your little band of incompetent goddesses supports me fully, I can get strong enough to defend this dimension against the attackers, be it the endless armies of the undead, the soulless machine legions, elemental creatures, and even the other pantheons. And, they will come, in a few months, maybe at most in a few years, but  they will come.” </p><p>It took all of my considerable acting abilities to look interested in her offer. “Are they really that strong?” I asked, letting my tone radiate fear. </p><p>“Far stronger than you can imagine,” she said. “It’s easy to get strong in a newly formed universe fragment like this, because the laws are yet to be solidified. However, it also means that your power has limits. Only when someone understands and controls the laws of a universe, one could be classified as transcendent. It was the reason we abandoned everything and came here.” </p><p>“Where it went wrong?” I asked. </p><p>“Those bastards. All they needed to do was to protect me against the elementals while I hastened the maturation of the universe by implanting the law fragments we had brought along, and we would have had enough power to defend ourselves against any incursion. But they chose to betray and imprison me, thinking that they could force me.”</p><p>“Then, what happened?” </p><p>“They had underestimated the mortals, and were overthrown. Not really important at this point,” she replied with a dismissive shrug.  </p><p>“Despite the power of the other universes?” I asked. </p><p>“Of course,” she replied. “It’s not easy for the transcended beings to invade another universe directly. The whole structure of existence will reject them, forcing them away.” </p><p>“And, what about those enemies you mentioned. The undead armies, machine legions, mages, pantheons? Can they access our dimension?” </p><p>Her smile was vicious. “Why do you think I took such a risk to solidify the laws of this fragmented universe quickly. Without the laws, sooner or later, a transcendent being would come here, taking over with ease. All they need is a reliable path.” </p><p>“One that the retreating Eternals would sell,” I completed. She nodded smugly, obviously thinking that my decision was inevitable. Of course, I doubted that it was as straightforward as she was implying for a transcendental power to move between universes. She was exaggerating to make me accept her alliance offer. </p><p>Unfortunately, I knew that her words weren’t far from the truth either. Falsehood, I could detect. And, the truth made her words even scarier. </p><p>“Why don’t you tell me more about the threats of the future,” I asked. </p><p>More than happy to give me even more things to be scared of, she started telling me horror stories about the other universes. </p><p>Some burning in eternal fires as angels and demons battled for supremacy….</p><p>Some lost their spark of magic, ruled in the merciless grip of technology, and developed strongly enough to replace magic…  </p><p>Some were captured by the human immortals, reshaped to fit their will… </p><p>Some fall under the unfeeling hordes of undead… </p><p>And, many universes, shattered completely as the transcendentals stole their fundamental laws and drained all their energy… </p><p>A merciless picture. </p><p>I needed to find a way to defend my little corner. </p><p>And, sometimes, the best defense was a good offense… </p>",

    "content": "<p>I was glad that I focused on the formation, as merely a day later, a solo figure approached the capital, flying leisurely on a sword. The formation master. </p><p>I let out a relaxed sigh when I noticed his cultivation level. He was a Foundation Establishment cultivator. A relatively strong one — Eight Stage, which I could detect directly thanks to the improvements in my formation technique — but still, I was confident that I could trick him. </p><p>I walked to the living room, where Aisnam was practicing her palm techniques as she tried to perfect her technique. “I just received a message. The formation expert is on the way,” I said. </p><p>“Let’s greet him,” she said. </p><p>“Actually, we better not,” I said. “The message says our allies will check to make sure he doesn’t leave any trap. Until then, we better not stay at Spring Palace,” I said. “I can mix with the guards, while you better go get the Queen from the palace, and visit Entsa Pavilion disciples, just in case,” I said. “That way, they can’t sabotage you. And, it might help your disguise if they call you to fight immediately.” </p><p>It was a good excuse to make sure she wouldn’t worry about her disguise. By ‘knowing’ about her supposed switch between the Queen and the servant, I ensured that she didn’t need to worry about her identity. And, by sending her away from the capital, I removed the temptation of dealing with her directly. </p><p>There were too many ways a formation expert could attack her. And, while I was confident that I could protect her, depending on the type of attack, there was no guarantee I could do while keeping hidden. It was safer to just remove the temptation altogether. </p><p>The formation expert floated into the city without caring about anyone like he owned the city, confident that a mortal city held no danger. He was mistaken, of course, but luckily for him, I had to actually stay hidden. </p><p>I was strong, but not strong enough enough to challenge Kartpa Valley. I had no idea how strong they were, but considering they were sending Golden Core elders to handle their chores rather than treating them as dangerous strategic weapons, it was clear that they had stronger people. </p><p>I didn’t think I could survive learning their exact strength, not anytime soon. </p><p>Formation expert arrived at the Spring Palace unimpeded and floated in front of it. I expected him to step inside. Instead, he made a fist, glowing with Qi. After gathering his energy for a few seconds, he punched. </p><p>Demolishing Spring Palace completely. </p><p>“Asshole,” I muttered as I watched him destroy the closest place I had to a home in this world, ignoring the temptation to teach him a lesson, one that I could teach easily. </p><p>Back at the cultivator market, I had struggled against a weaker Foundation Establishment cultivator, but that was with no formation to help me. Here, I could take him down faster than he destroyed the Spring Palace, including a lot of rooms that carried some very pleasant memories with them. </p><p>I sighed, once again shocked by the pointless destruction cultivators spread. I might have understood if he was making sure there was no trap in the house, or something similar, but his attitude made it clear that he did so because of his arrogance.</p><p>However, rather than walking in directly, he waved his hand, and a pile of spirit stones appeared in front of him. Not a small amount, I noted even as I watched him slowly build a formation, trying to understand his capabilities.  </p><p>“Manageable,” I muttered as I watched the Qi lines take shape around the garden. There was some difference between the two different major stages, but just like the combat techniques, the difference wasn’t qualitative. It was like trying to build a house from thatch and wood. There were some differences, but the fundamental principles were still the same. </p><p>And, while the Qi lines he created were stronger and more functional, there was no comparing the speed between the two of us. He spent almost ten minutes creating a defensive dome, something I could do in seconds. </p><p>Probably wasted a lot of Qi in the process, but it wasn’t like I was lacking that particular resource — particularly with my prisoner helping me to gain Qi even faster than Aisnam. I had visited him a few times, and every time, he attacked me with his presence, trying to bully me from his prison. </p><p>It just helped me to accumulate a hundred thousand strands of Qi in my inventory. Nothing compared to the amount spiritual vein could provide, but not only was it fully subdued, but also it wasn’t bound geographically. </p><p>However, as I watched the formation expert, I stopped thinking about my prisoner, and paid more attention to him. He wasn’t just setting a defensive formation. No, he was also setting an attack formation, one that was buried in the ground rather than linking to the defensive one. </p><p>A formation that was strong enough to kill multiple Foundation Establishment cultivators. </p><p>He clearly had some ulterior motives. What, I had no idea, nor that I cared much. Even if he stayed with the formation, I could steal the control of the formation. More importantly, I could see him linking the formation to an artifact, which was less efficient than direct control, making it likely that he would pass the control to someone else. </p><p>I just didn’t know if it was something they were planning to use it directly, or keep it for a different time. </p><p>I was tempted to steal it immediately, but after a momentary consideration, I decided to wait until the formation expert’s departure. It would be safer. Though, I didn’t neglect to add a tiny, impossible-to-notice flaw to Qi transmission, one that would make most of the attack power fizzle uselessly. </p><p>A choice that I was happy with as I watched the expert ‘repair’ the stone gate. First, he had set up a temporary protective formation. Thanks to my improved formation knowledge, I could see its function. It was to keep the being behind the door imprisoned. However, since that formation wasn’t anchored, it wouldn’t last long. It would dissolve in a few weeks. </p><p>Then, instead of repairing the damaged section, he started working on the intact parts, erasing each of them before replacing them with counterfeit anchors, which completely destroyed the formation that was keeping the being under control. </p><p>As I watched him, I was glad I had spent a lot of time improving my formation skills, as without it, I would have to attack him to prevent a potential disaster. But right now, I didn’t need to. I could easily improve his temporary formation to a permanent one by making some adjustments, and linking it to the spirit vein to make it even stronger than the spirit vein. </p><p>Not to mention, a formation that I could manipulate easily finally gave me a chance to understand what was the being that was imprisoned, and why it had to be kept captive under the capital. </p><p>I wanted to explore it, for one simple reason. Up until now, everything I had touched had shown a tendency to grow out of control, be it visiting a city or helping someone. And, now, the mysterious gate that likely stayed intact for centuries was being used for a conspiracy merely months after my arrival. </p><p>Being proactive to prevent a future disaster was a much better idea than waiting until it exploded. Particularly since, to my knowledge, many mortal kingdoms had similar gates underneath. Even if I could keep the one in the Zaim Kingdom safe, I couldn’t do the same for the others. And, since a high-ranking disciple of the Kartpa Valley was targeting this one, it was very likely that they were targeting the others as well. </p><p>I had a feeling that it would turn into another mess soon enough, particularly since a Kartpa Valley disciple was setting a trap despite the fact that they were about to take control. It was clearly a complicated mess.</p><p>However, after I watched the expert finish his work and float away, I didn’t immediately start working on the formation. For one simple reason. </p><p>“Cousin! It’s time for your death. Come to the arena, and accept, so I could remove the stain from our glorious family! I promise not to torture you too long if you kneel and beg!” shouted Aisnam’s cousin, showing exactly how much they cared about family. </p><p>I had a death match to spectate … and if necessary, cheat. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Ten days. </p><p>It turned out, we barely had ten days before Kartpa Valley could send a formation expert to the Kingdom of Zaim. </p><p>“They are asking you to return, Madam,” I said to Aisnam, acting like I received a message rather than spying on the conversation of the two Kartpa Valley disciples. “Apparently, the formation expert to repair the gate is on the way.” </p><p>“So soon,” she muttered, looking tense. </p><p>I understood her concerns. She was about to fight against a Foundation Establishment cultivator. Fighting against someone of a higher major realm was not only a major challenge but stuff of legends. “Don’t worry, I trust you,” I said. “Your cousin will be underestimating you. You just need to goad him to deal you in melee. Once he does, he’s finished. And, we don’t know when he’s going to arrive, so you might have a day or two to practice still. Focus on your tactics rather than improving your techniques further.” </p><p>“You’re right,” she said. </p><p>“Don’t worry, even if that fails, they won’t let you die. Look at this place,” I said as I waved my hand. “I don’t know who our mysterious benefactors are, but it’s clear that they are stronger than a minor sect. They still need you, meaning they won’t let you lose.” </p><p>She nodded. “I hope so,” she said stoically, but not looking too convinced. I understood her lack of trust. From her perspective, a mysterious benefactor with equally mysterious objectives was hard to trust. She was afraid that she would outlive her usefulness at one point and be discarded. </p><p>Luckily for her, that was not the case. She was important to me, and not just because of all the benefits I was able to get from the System with her unwitting help. </p><p>Not that I was underselling the benefits. Ten days was not a particularly long time, but my setup, along with her assistance, allowed me to improve to an unbelievable degree. </p><p>The biggest improvement had been in the eight arts of combat, namely, sword, saber, spear, staff, bow, fist, palm, and kick. The palm techniques had shown the greatest improvement, with all of them reaching Major Integration — the highest I could reach without that weird gate thing — and the sword techniques were just a step behind them, ranging from mere Perfection to Minor Integration. </p><p>The sword control technique was in Major Immersion, but that, I received from my prisoner. </p><p>The other six weapon arts had smaller improvements, with no new technique passing Perfection. Of course, while it was below my standards due to my cheating nature, I had no doubt that, if I dared to say that to any other cultivator, they would have killed me out of jealousy. Others worked for years just to bring a technique to Perfection. </p><p>While my combat techniques had seen the biggest improvement, they hadn’t been the most important ones. No, that honor went to my two expertise. Talisman crafting, and formations. Thanks to her talent in those two topics, she was able to make good progress in both techniques. And, once I replicated the methods I used for Sword techniques — inspiration from learning glow, calligraphy that embodied the concept of the art, and carefully hidden guidance — she made great progress in both. </p><p>And, her great progress meant even greater improvement for me. And, just like in weapon techniques, multiple different techniques addressed the weaknesses of each other, making my skill even stronger. </p><p>I even received two rewards I didn’t dare to activate after what happened to Pearyin. </p><p>[145x Return - Nabata Formation Technique Lesson - Major Immersion, Dao Entry]</p><p>[145x Return - Verdant Talisman Crafting Technique Lesson - Major Immersion, Dao Gate Beginner]</p><p>Still, it was nice to have a name for the next stage. It was my first clue of what happened to her, and could prove invaluable once I dealt with the current crisis, and start exploring what happened. </p><p>I wished that I could replicate the same with Forging and Alchemy. Unfortunately, without a basis, it would have taken months for Aisnam to even develop a beginner understanding. </p><p>We didn’t have months. </p><p>The last benefit I received was the gate construction techniques. I managed to convince her to study the other techniques in a last-ditch effort to strengthen her cultivation. It didn’t help her directly, but it helped me immensely. By mixing several gate techniques, I was able to reinforce my three gates to an absurd degree. I had no doubt that, even without cheating, I could rival Aisnam in raw power. </p><p>Too bad I lacked the ability to modify her gates directly. My medical knowledge was limited to martial arts. </p><p>“Are you going to come with me,” she asked. </p><p>“No. I think they’ll arrange another transport for me,” I replied. “But I don’t think it’ll take more than a day.” I kissed her. “Don’t worry, I’ll be there to celebrate your victory.” </p><p>“You better be,” she said before she stepped on the flying boat, and waved for once before the shield around the boat darkened, hiding the environment from her. I changed my disguise before joining her as some kind of silent warrior, and brought her back to the capital. </p><p>I hid the view from her as we traveled. Important, as the last thing I needed for her to realize the sacred land she had been practicing was in Markas. It would complicate things needlessly. </p><p>Once she went back to the capital through the tunnel, I packed the boat and went into the capital. </p><p>I needed to take down and modify the formation to a serious degree. I had no idea just how strong the formation expert visiting would be, but I couldn’t afford him to realize the existence of my grand formation. I had already made some changes to the formation thanks to the improvements I had, burying it deeper into the landscape, nearly invisible. </p><p>However, it was easier to hide the formation that was on the outside, mostly because no one was looking for it. The same didn’t apply to the formation at the capital, which was centered around the Spring Palace. </p><p>And, it was harder to hide something like that when there was an expert who would be significantly stronger than me as far as raw power was concerned. Particularly since what I feared happened and they sent a Golden Core cultivator. </p><p>I should have done it earlier, but most of my free time had been split between studying with Aisnam, and further developing the fake mystic land, both time-consuming activities. </p><p>Wait that in mind, I started working on the formation around the capital… But, as I worked on it, I started to use the connected formation to keep an eye on things. Markas was my focus as usual, but with its army out, fighting the other rebels, there wasn’t much to pay </p><p>However, the said army had been moving faster than I expected, showing that Kartpa Valley wasn’t the only one that was using a flying ship to deploy troops. And, with that deployment, the battles between the cities happened more and more frequently. </p><p>Cultivators stuck to their rules and didn’t interfere with the fights, but only because every notable fight had multiple Foundation Establishment cultivators recording. It seemed that every sect was doing its best to catch the others violating the rules, making the ongoing war an even weirder journey. </p><p>I had been too busy to directly interfere with the battles of the Markas army. Luckily, it seemed that Entsa Pavilion chose to supply them with a lot of pills, because despite fighting constantly, the number of Connate Realm martial artists was increasing rather than decreasing. </p><p>I still visited Markas twice times during the ten-day period just in case, and secretly raised another squad of Connate Realm martial artists for Crane School, ready to defend the city in case someone decided to attack city. </p><p>With both the spirit vein and the Dao Field — which I decided to name the weird gate effect based on the System naming the skill level Dao Gate — in Markas, I was even more incentivized to keep everything in order. </p><p>A similar hidden army was in the capital, already numbering five hundred Connate Realm martial artists, ready to deal with any nasty surprises. Not that it seemed to be necessary. The loyalists were already making great progress dealing with Tiger Fist army and the rebellion, city after city accepting Aisnam’s rule. </p><p>Though, I couldn’t help but wonder how much of it was just about Kartpa Valley’s confidence in the upcoming fight. Once Aisnam lost the duel, the other branch of the Verdant Family would have an easy time taking back the capital. </p><p>“It’s probably why Markas is receiving such support,” I decided. Since it was Markas army, led by Falnaher and Marana, that captured rebelling cities rather than the royal army, it would give Entsa Pavilion the ability to launch their own rebellion. No wonder they were supporting the army with so many pills. </p><p>“Too bad it’s wasted effort,” I said as I continued to modify the defenses of the capital, removing the surface defenses completely, and replacing them with hundreds of formations buried deep in the ground, ready to be activated by just a thought. It included everything I had developed. </p><p>The traps were ready. Nothing would happen to Aisnam. </p><p>Not even if a Golden Core cultivator decided to intervene. </p>",

    "content": "<p>As I watched Aisnam practice her palm techniques, I had a large smile on my face. It had been three days since her arrival, and she had already brought the eighth Palm Technique to Perfection, and trying to push toward Minor Immersion. </p><p>More importantly, with every technique she learned, the speed of her learning was getting faster and faster. Even under the acceleration effect of that weird gate, it took almost a day for her to properly learn that first technique. Yet, she practiced the current technique for barely two hours before she reached Perfection, achieving what was supposed to be impossible. </p><p>And, that was with the constant commentary she was running to my benefit while I practiced near her. </p><p>It was good to see that I wasn’t the only one benefiting from the System cheats, mostly due to its restrictions being quite easy to bypass. It further confirmed my earlier guess, that the mysterious goddess didn’t put any thought about how things would work before sending me here.</p><p>I stopped practicing my martial arts when she was covered with the distinct glow of a skill breakthrough. “Congratulations, madam,” I said. “You have taken another incredible step toward the mastery of your cultivation.” </p><p>She stopped as well, marking the end of the lesson, and triggering the system hit. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 60; Pampering Bonus - 85 (Capped)]</p><p>[145x Return - Great Quake Six Palms - Beginner, Minor Integration]</p><p>“Yes, it has been … fascinating,” she said. “Eight techniques in three days … what a wondrous achievement.” She looked dazed as she hugged me, not that I could blame her. </p><p>“Well, do you want to visit the other hills,” I said. “They have told me to break this talisman if you ever want to practice the other techniques.” </p><p>She looked conflicted. “Do you think I should, or should I focus on my palm techniques?” </p><p>“You should at least study fist techniques and the sword techniques,” I reminded her. “After all, your cousin is a Kartpa Valley disciple, and they apparently favor fist techniques, and flying swords are common for every Foundation Establishment cultivator. There’s no harm in being prepared for them, and I’m sure learning other techniques wouldn’t hurt, particularly since you have such an incredible opportunity. You can learn them now, and practice later.” </p><p>“You’re right,” she said, then chuckled. “It’s a pity that they don’t have such a marvelous effect for other techniques.” </p><p>I shrugged. “I don’t know much about cultivation, but even I know it’s more or less a miracle to have one, let alone multiple, right?” I asked. </p><p>“Certainly,” she answered. “I doubt even Entsa pavilion has something this wondrous. They have their mystic lands where the time flows faster, but they have their costs,” she said. </p><p>I nodded, trying to hide my surprise at her casual comment. I thought that I was getting used to the wondrous nature of the cultivation world, but the idea that even time could be manipulated was surprising. I was tempted to bring her to the hill where I was housing the formation techniques, curious if one of them included the information about how to manipulate time, but decided against it. </p><p>It was tempting, but the priority was to arm Aisnam properly. While I fully intended to cheat, the situation in the region was getting too complicated. There was a chance that, after her victory, her allies decided to protect her by moving her. If something like that happened, I needed her to be as safe as possible. </p><p>“Why don’t you meditate for a moment and prepare yourself while I go and arrange the details of the visit,” I said as I crushed the Symbol I had been holding temporarily, and left before waiting for an answer. Unlike the palm techniques, which had an inherent booster, I needed to change things a bit if I were to help her. </p><p>For that, I went to the hill where I had placed the sword techniques. I started by finally activating the insult reward I had received from my prisoner — who was currently straining against the formations that were keeping him trapped under the illusion that he could free himself — and my mind once again flooded with information. </p><p>Once again I was glad that the System softened the delivery. Just like how ordinary cultivation techniques were far more complicated than martial arts, the techniques for Foundation Establishment cultivators were far more complicated than ordinary techniques. An order of magnitude better. </p><p>And, they were expensive as hell. The ordinary techniques used only used fractions of strands. Even the most expensive one used a strand or two. The flying sword, on the other hand, consumed five strands for its weakest hit, and it was possible to deliver harder hits by spending more Qi. </p><p>They were perfect for the Foundation Establishment cultivator’s higher capability. </p><p>While I processed that, the glow of reaching Major Integration covered the hill, once again imprinting the achievement of reaching the skill. Interestingly, it was just as strong as the other times, suggesting that the strength of the technique didn’t matter. </p><p>Or, if it did, it required a stronger technique. </p><p>Either way, I didn’t care even as I immersed myself in the sensation as I carved the words Sword Hill on a wooden board, embedding it with the strongest conception of the flying sword skill I could manage. Only then, I browsed the techniques, and realized that I could easily reach the Major Familiarity stage for each of them. It looked like mastering a Foundation Establishment technique helped even more than I expected, and the persistent glow helped as well. </p><p>More than happy to abuse that detail as well, I prepared a set of notes for every technique to hasten Aisnam’s learning, which took about half an hour.</p><p>When I returned, Aisnam shuffled from her meditation. “Everything alright?” she asked. </p><p>“Yes. They asked me to organize some of the notes for you first,” I said as I led her toward the hill. She stumbled once she saw the wooden board like I had punched her. Even her nose started to bleed before she avoided looking at the board. </p><p>I might have overdone with embedding the conception of sharpness in my calligraphy. A good note for the future. </p><p>“Are you alright?” I asked. </p><p>“Don’t worry about it. It was just that the sword intent is … too strong,” she muttered. “It’s a good thing. It’ll help me to learn even faster. I was just unprepared,” she said before she started reading. </p><p>As she started reading, I walked behind her, my hands on her shoulders, massaging her gently. “Don’t distract me,” she muttered. </p><p>“No, you need this,” I said even as I rubbed her shoulders, using my essence to relax her. “You have been working hard for the last few days, you know it affects your learning,” I said. “You’ll learn it faster. Trust me,” I said. </p><p>“I doubt it,” she muttered, clearly not believing me, but spending the last few days trying to decipher the new techniques without sleep, even with the learning assistance of that weird gate, had stressed her too much to object to a shoulder rub. </p><p>Luckily for her, the shoulder rub was actually helping her. Mostly because I was cheating by using my essence to slowly mimic both the concept of the sword and some of the basic sword moves coming from the Foundation Establishment sword control technique. Combined with the glow from the skill breakthrough and the calligraphy, she managed to reach Beginner comprehension rapidly, in just under an hour. </p><p>“It helps, right,” I muttered once she processed her progression properly. </p><p>“I must have been more tired than I realized because it actually did,” she responded as she leaned back, nuzzling against my chest while I caressed her hair, enjoying the momentary moment of calm. I was tempted to let her collapse against my chest and sleep, but I did not. </p><p>Things were getting more and more heated. And, while it was tempting to offer her to stay here forever and cultivate in peace, I knew enough about Aisnam that she wouldn’t be happy living like this. Not if it meant escaping the people that killed her brother and tried to kill her. </p><p>“Feel free to share your insights,” I said instead. “I’m planning to create a new sword-based martial arts, and I’m sure it’ll help.” </p><p>She chuckled. “You and your techniques,” she said cutely, but stayed leaning against my chest. “The technique I just learned is called the Merciful Sword, and it relies on the concept of a wind. It relies on moving fast enough that the enemy dies before they could even understand they are under attack…” </p><p>I didn’t interrupt her as I listened, already planning on the next steps of learning. Sword techniques were the biggest priority, mostly because she needed to learn how to defend herself convincingly against them.

    "content": "<p>“The food was delicious,” I congratulated Astrid. It was not entirely true. However, considering the reason, I chose not to mention it. </p><p>Lillian wasn’t as considerate. “Just slightly overcooked,” she commented with a big smile. “Were you doing something to distract you?” Astrid’s blush was spectacular. </p><p>“I’m sure she was just busy recovering her mana,” I commented, interrupting Lillian. “She had spent a lot of mana to tame her new beast, after all.” I ignored Lillian’s pointed glare as I ruined her fun. Though, it was fun to see her act freely. She was a different person with more people around. </p><p>However, it might be also about the fact that, for once, we weren’t running for our lives. </p><p>“That. Exactly that!” Astrid replied. That made me chuckle. She might as well shouted that she was doing something illicit. I wondered just how long it would take her to realize I could easily catch her peeking. I could have done so even without my enhancements. </p><p>She wasn’t a particularly good huntress. I guessed that her duties as a priestess didn’t leave her much time. </p><p>“What next?” I asked. </p><p>“It’s time to build a vegetable garden,” Lillian commented. “Astrid. Do you want to watch? </p><p>“Are you going to use your druid magic?” Astrid asked, almost as excited as she had been peeking at us. Lillian nodded. “Then, yes,” she said, then frowned. “Isn’t it a bit wasteful for you to spend your energy on ordinary food?” </p><p>“It’s better than foraging every day. The valley is not exactly teeming with vegetables.” </p><p>It was true. While wild plants were common, not all of them were edible, and a majority of the edible ones didn’t taste particularly well. Using her mana would have been still wasteful … but saying that we had mana to waste was an understatement. </p><p>“It’ll be fun to watch an expert at work,” I said. We walked to the spot Lillian picked. A sunny patch near the spring. </p><p>“First, the preparation,” she said as she waved her wand, and a thick column of water pulled from the spring. Astrid tensed at the display, but said nothing. I put my hand on her shoulder. </p><p>“You’re tense,” I said. </p><p>“It’s the elemental magic,” Astrid said, her tenseness clear. “It’s just cur—  unnatural,” she said, barely correcting herself halfway. Still, it was progress. </p><p>“I understand your feelings,” I said even as I took a step behind her, and started rubbing her shoulders. I might not be as perceptive as Lillian, but after the number of times she peeked at us, it was clear that she would enjoy my touch. Add in my identity as her savior, it was a good way to counter her negativity as she watched Lillian. “But, does using elemental magic for farming is such a horrible thing?” </p><p>As for her comments about elemental magic being cursed, I had no idea about it. It might be the truth, or it might be a complete nonsense. </p><p>I could proudly claim myself an expert of elemental magic, for anything below the domain of sorcerers. Not just the practice, but also the theory. Even as an apprentice, I could have leveraged the elements in ways most others couldn’t even contemplate, healing with fire, strengthening with air, and enhancing the mind through earth. </p><p>Unfortunately, that knowledge didn’t extend to the history of magic. Astrid’s whole argument for her distaste relied on elemental magic being some kind of a curse, a taint. Whether that had any truth, I had no idea. I just needed to make sure Astrid didn’t feel so hostile. </p><p>So, as I rubbed her back, we watched Lillian use her water magic to infuse earth, plowing the earth with the efficiency of a small army of peasants. It took merely a minute for her to finish preparing an acre of land. </p><p>I was impressed by her performance. When we first met, Lillian was barely able to control a water blade, focusing on efficient usage of her mana for subtler applications of magic, like creating a mist to feed some fragile mana plants. When we fought, she was able to create one water blade, which wobbled under her control. </p><p>And, now, she was able to use half a dozen water plows simultaneously with great speed, each leaving lines of upturned earth behind. Impressive, even though the lines she created were a bit crooked. A part of it was her developing vitae. She was several times more powerful than when we first met, which certainly helped her, and accessing a limitless amount of mana was certainly beneficial. </p><p>However, while there was no doubt that her power and utility had increased, the same couldn’t be said for her control. The blades of water weren’t stable, changing shape as they constantly bled their energy, and attempts to utilize them were wasteful. </p><p>Not that I blamed her. With her raw power increasing that much, it was an inevitable end. I had noticed during our escape, but at that time, prioritizing power had been the more reasonable option. Now, I needed to come up with an exercise for her. </p><p>I already had designed some exercises for my eventual breakthrough — before it developed toward an unexpected direction —  but I didn’t hate her enough to subject her to those. </p><p>Still, coming up with an appropriate exercise would take some time. I loved my grandfather, but there was no arguing that he was a true madman, and since I had been trained by him, my own perception was a bit warped. I needed to find something less resembling torture for her. </p><p>“I have never seen elemental magic used for anything but killing…” Astrid whispered as Lillian continued to prepare her vegetable garden. </p><p>“I won’t lie to you and say that it’s common practice,” I admitted. “There’s not many mages that bother to spend their time doing menial work. Why bother, when they have peasants and slaves to handle everything. Still, it’s not the fault of the magic itself, is it?” </p><p>“True,” she muttered reluctantly as my fingers continued to dance on her shoulders, relaxing her further. “But, that doesn’t mean the elemental magic is not cursed and against nature.” </p><p>“True, but we all work with what we have,” I admitted, not pushing her about the topic. It didn’t matter whether she was right or not. I just needed her to drop her outright hostility, so that if she noticed my damaged elemental cores while helping me, she wouldn’t suddenly panic. </p><p>Once Lillian finished preparing the garden and started planting the seeds, Astrid relaxed noticeably. The reason: Lillian had stopped using her elemental magic, shifting to druid abilities. She placed a seed before she closed her eyes and let a drop of blood fall on the seed before covering it. </p><p>As she progressed, some of the earlier seeds had already sprouted, showing the impressive ability of her heritage. I could enjoy it even if I closed my eyes. The subtle flare of mana the plants let out as they grew gave me a comforting sensation. </p><p>Under that feeling, I couldn’t help but feel that Astrid had a point. Even if elemental magic itself was not cursed, the way Rome had used it to destroy the heritage of the others certainly was. Invading Britannia wasn’t enough, they had also destroyed every druid they found to make sure there would be no rebellion. </p><p>Indeed, disappointing. </p><p>“You’re much more comfortable watching her use her druidic abilities, right?” I asked Astrid. </p><p>“Yes,” Astrid admitted. “I don’t exactly know how her blood magic works, but I could feel it align with nature. It’s not touched by the curse of the elements.” </p><p>“Really,” I asked, curious. Inevitably, I thought about my own sudden calm, one that I hadn’t felt since my botched breakthrough. I closed my eyes to focus, only to realize, for once, that the crystal embedded in my heart was not throbbing wildly, pumping mana. </p><p>Instead, it was almost slumbering. That was an unexpected development. Unfortunately, I didn’t think that it was a solution to my problem. Even as my foreign instincts calmed down, I could feel that it was something temporary. Underneath that facade of calm, unlimited power was still vibrating wildly. </p><p>“Of course. As a priestess, I’m particularly sensitive to the state of the plants,” she declared, like it was something obvious. </p><p>Interesting. I thought about questioning her in an indirect way, digging for answers without ever alerting her, but that wouldn’t work. “And, why is that?” </p><p>“It’s because of our vitae. We’re sensitive to all life, but particularly the plant life,” she said. I didn’t ask another question, but my fingers moved faster. “Since we carry the essence from the Tree of Life, we—” she started, only to freeze, tensing under my fingers. Not only that, but I could feel her heartbeat driving me crazy. </p><p>I suspected that she had just let out a huge secret… </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Hey, girls. The food delivery is here,” I called from a distance. Lillian just waved smugly, while Astrid flinched. Then, she relaxed, no doubt thinking the distance was enough that I didn’t hear Astrid listening to Lillian’s stories about her mana-draining assistance. </p><p> “Wow, you must be feeling really hungry,” Lillian said as she pointed at the huge deer on my back. </p><p>“No, actually. This is a gift for our beautiful priestess,” I said as I put the unconscious deer down. </p><p>“It’s alive,” Astrid gasped, surprised as she bounded forward. </p><p>I nodded. “Yes. Not only alive, but completely pristine. When I saw him, I thought that it would make a good target to tame. He’s strong enough to give you some defenses, and I’m sure he’ll be more amenable to be treated as a mount than that wolf.” </p><p>”Certainly,” Astrid muttered, fascinated. Then, she looked at me. “And, you trust me with a tamed beast,” she added. </p><p>“Of course I trust you,” I answered with the softest smile I could manage. Admittedly, she was misreading the situation somewhat. Giving her the deer wasn’t the show of trust she expected. She was under the impression that, during the escape, I had shown the full range of my capabilities. </p><p>That wasn’t the case. In truth, even I didn’t know the full range of my capabilities, which were changing and expanding continuously. Still, letting her believe that was harmless. </p><p>Astrid looked at me with appreciation even as she put her hand on the head of the deer, her mana slowly turning into a web of strings … well, somewhat. Even with my senses, it was difficult to catch the intricacies of her casting. </p><p>However, while I called it mana, it was certainly not the wild, pure mana of the environment. It was changed and transformed in some way, but I didn’t know about the method. I didn’t ask her, not wanting to ruin our nascent trust. </p><p>Lillian was watching her just as carefully. We might differ in almost all ways, but there was no denying her passion for magic rivaled mine. Watching Astrid work on her beast-taming magic was a unique talent. </p><p>“The first step is done,” Astrid said. “When he woke up, he’ll stay around and not attack, but taming him truly will take some time.” </p><p>“Fascinating,” Lillian said. “Now, why don’t you go and thank Marcus.” Astrid opened her mouth, but before she could do so, Lillian continued. “The Roman way, of course.” </p><p>“The Roman way?” Astrid asked. I was tempted to ask the same question, as I certainly didn’t know a unique way we thanked each other, at least not a method that required Lillian to have that tone. However, Lillian’s smirk showed that she had a plan, and I didn’t want to ruin it, so I kept my mouth shut. </p><p>“Yes, let me show you,” Lillian replied as she grabbed my shirt, and pulled me for a heated kiss. One that I responded immediately, enjoying the kiss. Though, amusing as it was, there was no chance it would work. After all, living in a nomadic tribe didn’t mean Astrid was an idiot.</p><p>“T-that’s a way to thank?” Astrid stammered, her blush spectacular. </p><p>“Yes. It’s traditional,” Lillian replied. </p><p>“Well… Traditions are important,” Astrid muttered, her blush spiking as she took another step, and covered the distance. My eyes widened as Astrid put her hand on my forearm, trying to balance herself. There was no way that she believed that, right?</p><p>I looked at Lillian’s smug expression, and then Astrid’s hesitant reach. My eyes widened as the trick finally clicked. Naturally, Astrid didn’t believe it, but she decided to act like she believed it, even at the expense of looking like an idiot. </p><p>Under different circumstances, such a move would have made me very suspicious, making me wonder whether Astrid was trying to lower our alertness to pull a trick. Admittedly, even now, without the benefits of my transformation, I might have still thought that. But, one benefit of my improved senses, was that there was no way for Astrid to hide her sudden spike of arousal at the idea of thanking me via this so-called Roman way. </p><p>I could have leaned for a kiss, but I didn’t. If she was going to play games, she better take the initiative to finish. However, she just waited, hesitant yet excited, her pouty lips trembling. </p><p>I had to admit, Lillian managed to read her well. She was much better than me when it came to understanding motivations and giving gentle nudges. Maybe it was the benefit of a proper noble education, instead of the torture I received from my dear old grandfather. </p><p>Was that training useful, certainly. The only reason I even survived the constant trail of disasters that followed me since my escape was his intense training, but it left some weak spots as well. However, the comparative benefits of traditional versus crazy training for noble scions had to take a backseat, because Astrid finally took the initiative. </p><p>I couldn’t help but smile as she wrapped her arms around my chest and rose to her toes to cover the distance. Only when her lips pressed against mine, did I put my hands on her, wrapping her waist gently. Astrid stayed there, giving me a chaste, hesitant kiss that showed her lack of experience. </p><p>Inexperienced she might be, but she was certainly enthusiastic. Soon, her lips started to move, trying to initiate a beautiful dance. I allowed her to set the pace, no matter how tempting it was to take control and … test her willingness to share Lillian’s mission to help me drain my excess mana immediately. </p><p>I knew it was a bad idea. But, actually following that was difficult, particularly when she was kissing me so enthusiastically, our bodies pressing together to tempt me even more. </p><p>And, Astrid had a lot of temptation under her clothes. </p><p>Letting her go when she pulled back from the kiss was a supreme act of willpower, especially since Astrid was gasping as she had just sprinted a mile while being chased by a tiger. “Thank you,” Astrid muttered as she looked down, avoiding my gaze. I loosened my arms, and she took a step behind me. </p><p>Meanwhile, I looked at Lillian, making sure she wasn’t reacting badly. It wouldn’t be the first time someone realized the idea of something was more palatable than the real thing. I was afraid of seeing jealousy — or worse, anger — on her face. </p><p>Instead, I just saw desire as her eyes bounced between me and Astrid, her excitement surprising, but not a big one. Britannia might have been treated as a puritanical backwater province, but it was only when compared to the rest of Rome, where orgies were treated as perfectly acceptable social bonding activities. </p><p>“It was my pleasure,” I said to Astrid. </p><p>Lillian waited expectantly for things to escalate, and sighed when it proved not to be the case. “So, what’s the plan for the rest of the day.” </p><p>“That depends,” I said. </p><p>“On what?” </p><p>“Whether our guest priestess is any good cooking?” I asked as I looked at Astrid, and smiled at her gently. “Do you mind preparing the lunch?” I asked. </p><p>She didn’t answer immediately but opened the bundle that had the vegetables I collected, her eyes widening. “That’s a good haul,” she said as she checked the variety. </p><p>Lillian looked at me surprised. “Why don’t you cook. I like your cooking.” </p><p>“I can, but I need your help. I stumbled into a mana flare while exploring, and I accidentally absorbed too much. I need your help … dealing with it,” I said, whispering the last part while throwing a furtive glance at Astrid, like I was trying to keep it hidden from her. </p><p>I might not have Lillian’s interpersonal skills, but I wasn’t exactly a slouch either. </p><p>“I see,” Lillian said, her eyes widening. “That’s troubling. We better not let it linger for long.” With that, she grabbed my hand and started dragging me away. After a few steps, she stopped and looked back at Astrid, who was trying to hide the fact that she was watching us disappear with an even bigger blush. </p><p>“Anything else?” Astrid managed to whisper shyly under Lillian’s gaze. </p><p>“Make sure to keep the seeds. Since we’re going to stay here, a vegetable garden can be useful.” </p><p>“That’s it?” Astrid asked. </p><p>“Yes,” Lillian said, then smirked. “Unless, of course, you want to watch the ritual for … dealing with his excess mana. It’s very interesting … magically speaking.” </p><p>Astrid looked at her in shock, but also with desire. It was an offer she was interested in, considering she had spent a lot of time peeking at us the previous time. Yet, an open invitation seemed to be more than she was ready to accept. “M-maybe later,” Astrid whimpered. </p><p>”Sure. Feel free to join if you change your mind,” Lillian said and winked at her. With that, we were off.  </p>",

    "content": "<p>After the show she had watched with an intense focus, I wasn’t able to talk with Astrid. At some point, she sat in a concealed corner, and acted like she was meditating to avoid talking to me. I knew that she wasn’t meditating as the mana around her wasn’t showing any turbulence, but she was too distracted by the memories of the show to notice that detail. </p><p>And, that was with thinking she managed to stay hidden while peeking. How entertaining. </p><p>As much as I was tempted to talk to her, secure. And, since we finally had a camp that would stick around, we could eat something else than roasted meat. This time, I didn’t just want to hunt but also forage, hoping for some herbs to change the taste at a minimum. If I was lucky, I might even find some roots or wild vegetables, enough to make a side dish or two. </p><p>While I wanted to learn about the ways of the shapeshifters as soon as possible, I didn’t need to talk with Lillian to know that pushing Astrid too much would only backfire. A day or two wouldn’t make too much difference either way at this point, and letting Astrid feel confident and secure while letting her take things at her own pace was more important. </p><p>I needed to trust Lillian. </p><p>Without the sensation of mana churning on my body, I didn’t need to hurry up while foraging. I deliberately walked at the edge of the valley, mixing it with a scouting expedition. Just because I believed that we managed to ditch our opponents didn’t mean that there was no risk. The world was more complicated than that. </p><p>And, our little group was certainly suspicious. Three people, a man, and two women, with one clearly Germanic origin while the other clearly had a rich upbringing, was a notable sight. I didn’t trust either to conceal their origins in any hope of success. Such a setup shouted easy pickings. </p><p>Revealing our magic would have protected us from any opportunistic enemy, but revealed a new problem. It would bring a whole new set of attention. At this point, I didn’t know which one was worse. Lillian couldn’t use her powers, because the identity of a blonde water mage with noble bearing was distinct enough to be a part of the gossip, and might be enough to bring our enemies to us. Astrid was a Germanic priestess, and the idea of one moving on her own behind the border would surely catch the attention of the legion scouts. </p><p>Then, there was my abilities. The best case was for them to mistake me for a shifter, which would be the same case as Astrid. The worst option was for them to realize that there was something extraordinary about my abilities. </p><p>I shivered. </p><p>It wouldn’t have gone well. </p><p>However, just because extending the foraging trip was done out of necessity didn’t mean I hated it. On the contrary, I loved it quite a bit. The valley was wild, untouched. It might have been irritating for others, but I always liked wilderness. There were no pointless insults or annoying relatives there, just the plants, beasts, and the gentle caress of the sun. </p><p>I climbed the edge of the valley, enjoying the challenge of the steep stone wall that even a mountain goat would have found challenging. The midday sun rested against my skin, but the usual sweat that would have followed was nowhere to be found. My new strength meant that the climb was nowhere near challenging. </p><p>A smile popped onto my face as I finished my climb, and looked at the valley in front of me, unfolding like a beautiful painting. The previous times, I didn’t bother looking at how it looked, focusing on the more practical things like the magical fauna and hunter access. </p><p>Now, I was in a mood to enjoy the towering presence of the trees, their leaves shining emerald under the sun, the chirping of the birds a gentle melody. </p><p>“Not a bad place to set a camp for a month or two,” I muttered as I realized the valley was mine to explore, and I intended to do exactly that. Amusingly, I couldn’t help but feel glad for the constant war at the border. Otherwise, such dense magical locations wouldn’t have been ignored, and one noble family or other would have moved on, turning it into another farm to raise mana plants. </p><p>No one did here, as having such a valuable asset near the border would have been just an invitation for constant raids. </p><p>As I was lost in thought, a flicker in the far side caught my eye. A deer, its coat the color of burnished copper, its antlers thick with an unnatural soft glow. A second-order beast, fire-natured. It gnawed on a patch of wild grass with some mana, its attitude lacking the usual fear of its kind. </p><p>It didn’t surprise me. While each beast had its embodiment of their elemental nature, it was rare for a beast of fire to have weak explosive strength. The beast was probably confident enough with its strength to deal with any second-order predator. </p><p>Too bad he was about to get a new one. He would make a nice present for Astrid. She lacked the offensive means, and giving her a beast would help her feel secure, representing our trust in the process. </p><p>I slid down the valley silently and moved toward it. I managed to sneak to it from its downwind, easily avoiding its attention until it was too late. </p><p>He flinched when he noticed my presence, its body locked as its elemental nature fought with its beastly nature. For a deer, escaping was the best way to get away from danger, but its fire nature leaned more on aggression. </p><p>In the end, its beastly nature proved stronger, but it was too late. I had already darted forward, the stones crunching under my feet as I covered the remaining distance, and grabbed him from behind. </p><p>The beast raged as it tried to get away, but it was hopeless. Even with elements boosting its presence, his situation was hopeless. With me on its back, tightly wrapping its throat, he had no way to counter me. A third-order beast might have attacked through its magic, but a second-order beast was helpless against my presence on its back. </p><p>With a smirk, I tightened my hold, achieving something that was impossible for a normal man. I put a deer into a successful chokehold. Soon, it collapsed silently, its eyes wide with shock. </p><p>“Not a bad haul,” I muttered as I went back to our camp, with the unconscious deer on my back. It was a significant haul, almost reaching five hundred pounds, but it wasn’t enough to convince me to extend the trip a bit more, picking the wild vegetables I managed to find, and even managed to hunt a few pheasants and a large rabbit. </p><p>All needed to prepare the meal. But, before I could return, I felt some kind of presence in the depths of the valley. Overwhelming yet threatening, it went as quickly as it appeared. Any sane person should have feared, yet, my heart started to beat with excitement, pumping more mana to my body. </p><p>Apparently, my new instincts decided to treat that prey as a worthwhile one, and started to pump more mana. “Inconvenient,” I muttered as I moved back to the camp faster than I planned. Luckily, as that sensation disappeared, so did the sudden mana flood to my body, but not before reaching the point of another intervention. </p><p>When I returned, I saw Lillian and Astrid chatting. Lillian noticed my presence, but Astrid did not, allowing me to hear their conversation. And, with my hearing, I didn’t need to get too close. </p><p>Lillian was giving a highly redacted version of my situation, particularly, my ability to ‘soften the mana I gather from the environment, helping Lillian to progress faster. Also, I had a problem with draining mana constantly.  </p><p>As she explained, Astrid was using her particular brand of magic to check for any possible side effects, finding none. Lillian impressed me. Not only she was informing Astrid about my unique condition, but also she was doing it as safely as she could manage under the circumstances. </p><p>Constantly devouring environmental mana was much less sensitive than actually generating mana. Hopefully, learning the magic of shifting would be enough to solve my problem, and we wouldn’t have to reveal it. </p><p>Then, as I continued to approach, the story turned to how Lillian enjoyed ‘helping’ me deal with the excess mana. </p><p>It was a good point to interrupt, I decided. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I woke up abruptly, with a blaring phone ringing. Yet, despite that, I was happy waking up. It took more than that to ruin the impact of waking up in the arms of a sexy blonde that was still filled with my seed. </p><p>Emily answered the call. “Where are you? You’re late,” a sharp voice shouted from the other side. </p><p>“I’m sorry, supervisor,” Emily gasped as she shuffled, her eyes widening as she checked the phone. “I had a little accident. I’m on my way.” </p><p>“Why didn’t you call and inform me,” she asked. Emily tried to stand up, but she failed to do so, mostly because I chose to hug her. She was wearing the ruined remains of her yoga pants, which made her extremely sexy. </p><p>She sent a warning glare, which I ignored. “I’m sorry, supervisor. I had a little accident, and I was a little … unsettled,” Emily answered, her voice turning suddenly shrill as my fingers started exploring her body. </p><p>“What’s wrong?” she asked, her concern obvious. “You don’t sound normal.” </p><p>“Just the — p-pain,” Emily gasped as I slipped my rapidly growing cock in, and pushed her down on her bed, making her lay prone. </p><p>“Pain? Why? Are you injured?” she asked. </p><p>“Liar,” I whispered, earning another warning glare. </p><p>She muted her phone for a second as she looked back. “You - you want me to continue working there. I can’t do that if I’m fired,” she admonished me. </p><p>I slapped her ass before she could unmute the call, forcing her to moan as she sent another scathing glare at me. “Go on,” I said mockingly. </p><p>“Nothing serious, just a sprain, but it delayed me a bit,” Emily answered, her strained voice very convincing as I continued to invade her tight core. “I promise that I’ll be there in an hour.” </p><p>The voice sighed. “No, stay at home. I’ll send you an email. Just make sure to finish working on them before the end of the day, and we’re golden. Just don’t tell anyone.” </p><p>“R-really. Thank you, supervisor,” Emily replied. “I’ll make it up to you.” </p><p>They chatted for another minute, mostly her supervisor giving her some basic tasks, though Emily’s voice started to get more and more strained with each second as I continued to invade her core. </p><p>Still, my growing smile wasn’t about her incredible tightness … well, not fully. No, that was about the task Emily was assigned. It was some basic procurement jobs, something that shouldn’t be important in any shape or form. </p><p>Yet, it was interesting for two reasons. First, technically, it wasn’t a part of Emily’s job description, a fact that was confirmed a moment later when the documents arrived at Emily’s personal email account. </p><p>Second, it was an area I was interested in. Procurement, the department responsible for the purchases. Critical since I was hoping to use the Guild to purchase some critical equipment to boost my security. </p><p>“You’re evil —” Emily gasped, which was all she was able to say as I picked up speed, now that I wasn’t afraid of alerting her supervisor. </p><p>“Old news,” I teased her even as I spanked her, and pulled her phone from her fingers. “Let me check those,” I said as I opened the mail she had just received. It was a huge spreadsheet, filled with lines and lines of purchases. Unfortunately, those lists were not really useful, mostly limited to pens, printer cartridges, and other mundane office equipment. </p><p>No wonder the supervisor took the risk of </p><p>“That’s a lot of work. What’s this about?” I asked. </p><p>Emily shrugged. “It just needs to be double-checked and formatted before being put into a presentation. With my power, it was merely taking half an hour, so I help her when she asks.” </p><p>“How rude, abusing my dear secretary like that,” I said with a chuckle even as I spanked her again. She moaned, enjoying my possessive words as much as more direct aspects of her treatment. Still, even as I fucked her, I went over the huge spreadsheet, which included all the office supplies the guild needed for the month. “Do you have any other emails like this she had sent?” I asked. </p><p>“Yes, I didn’t delete them,” she moaned. </p><p>“Good girl,” I said without stopping. She moaned again, her body trembling. As much as teasing her more actively was tempting, I started going through her emails, checking every additional work she had received, my smirk growing bigger and bigger. </p><p>I had been wondering how to infiltrate the guild, when an opportunity had just come to my feet. The procurement lists Emily had received weren’t limited to office supplies. There was catering, computers, repairs … even entertainment for company events. </p><p>A full list that included the names of the suppliers, delivery dates, and many other items. </p><p>I should have been surprised. Ordinary purchases as they might be, a guild was too sensitive of a location to give such a vulnerability. But then, unlike its predecessor guild, the New Giant Force wasn’t the most professional outfit when it came to such detail. </p><p>I was glad of it. After all, if they had been, they would have discovered the true nature of Emily’s power sooner. </p><p>Of course under normal circumstances, such a vulnerability wouldn’t matter much. For a hostile attacker, there were easier ways to attack the guild building. However, it was a godsend for someone aiming to infiltrate the place. </p><p>It didn’t suddenly turn trivial, but it was not a level of progress I was expecting to make … particularly since I could turn it into a red herring. I went over the procurement lists, marking a few companies. </p><p>“Find me everything about the companies I marked, immediately,” I said as I passed her phone back. </p><p>She let out a disappointed sigh, clearly expecting me to stop. I spanked her ass again. “Immediately,” I added, my hips not slowing down even the slightest. She looked back, her eyes wide in excitement as she realized I expected her to work while ‘working’. </p><p>I said nothing, just smirked as her gaze shared her emotions. She didn’t stop looking at me even as she put her hand on her phone, which was more than enough to handle the task I had assigned to her. She finished the report without breaking eye contact as I fucked her, and passed the phone back to me. </p><p>“Let’s see,” I said as I started to go through the report. But, just as I finished the report on the first company, my eyes widened. Halfway in, she had put a picture of hers, wearing one of the sexy lingerie that I purchased for her, posing. “Naughty,” I said as I chuckled. </p><p>It wasn’t the only picture she put. Some were almost demure, while the others showed off her body completely, once again showing her naughty nature. </p><p>Just as important as the pictures she put, the reports she had put together in seconds were equally impressive. Not only did it include every public detail for the companies I had picked, but also it included detailed dossiers on every employee from the lowest part-time employee to the upper management. </p><p>Going through some of their select social media pictures, I could see at least two owners with spending problems. Checking further, I found some debt collection orders and multiple bankruptcy suits. Already, a plan was taking shape. </p><p>I thought about using our newly acquired funds to purchase one of them and use them to infiltrate, but I decided against it. Such a big move would surely be noticed. Instead, I decided to lean on my more ordinary abilities. “I need you to set a fake profile for me as a young chef, and send a job application for the catering company. At the same time, forward the location of the current chef to the police, and make some complaints about selling drugs.”</p><p>He already had a warrant, so the police would arrest him, leaving the company to find a last-minute replacement for the chef for the upcoming event — some kind of an office party for the ordinary employees. </p><p>A perfect excuse for me to be inside the perimeter. </p><p>“As you wish, sir?” she moaned as I tightened my grip on her hips, and started drilling her with an absolute lack of mercy, her moans spectacular. </p><p>The feeling of a plan getting together was too spectacular to ignore. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Fifteen hundred meter race in Kazakhstan. My contacts are saying that the favorite has some health issues he kept hidden, so we’re betting on the second biggest favorite.” </p><p>Bet on number 4 from accounts 35B, spread three thousand dollars; 29C, four thousand, and 228K, and 21D, ten thousand,” I said, making a bet below twenty thousand dollars, spread between more than a hundred accounts. “And, spent five thousand to bet on the favorite from the other accounts.” </p><p>An effort that was only worthwhile thanks to Emily’s power, for a potential payoff of a hundred thousand dollars. Of course, it wasn’t a message from an imaginary contact but another discovery with my power as I scoured the globe for random sporting events. </p><p>“Done,” she answered though I could feel the exhaustion in her tone. I could understand that well, as I felt the same. I was suffering a headache, and for once, it wasn’t about overdriving my power, but due to sheer overwork. Watching multiple screens while at the same time taking notes and making calculations about the spreads wasn’t easy. “What next?” </p><p>“Now, we watch the game and see whether we win the last game of the night or not,” I said as I moved to stand behind her, and started rubbing her shoulders. She was stiff, though it was more about stress than exhaustion. She was not an experienced gambler, and the constant rollercoaster of wins and losses took a toll on her. </p><p>Not that I blamed her. The body reacted explosively to the wins and losses. Otherwise, people wouldn’t have got addicted to gambling. I knew that feeling intimately … from my previous attempts to earn some cash before I got my power. </p><p>However, right now, I find it a strangely dull affair. A part of it was no doubt my power. The fun of the gambling came from the excitement of the unknown, and the ability to observe made things very predictable. </p><p>Not to mention, even if that hadn’t worked, the possibility of losing money didn’t make me afraid. Just like the prospect of winning some didn’t trigger one. Not when I had a game that I had been playing with much higher stakes. No amount of gambling could match the excitement of seducing one of the most dangerous heroes of the world while also manipulating her for my own aims… </p><p>Amusingly, so was seducing and teasing Emily, despite her lack of offensive capability. She might lack the ability to casually throw buildings, but her power was turning out to be even more important than I expected. </p><p>I was never more glad that the Guild missed her ability to use stronger computers for incredible multitasking efficiency, which turned her power into something incredible. Combined with mine, it was enough to turn it into something truly spectacular. </p><p>When compared to it, a sporting event that might bring a hundred thousand dollars didn’t mean anything … particularly after repeating that a hundred times tonight. Right now, I was ten million dollars richer, a number that was impossible to imagine. </p><p>Of course, spending that money wasn’t as straightforward, especially for anything related to combating supers, but it should be usable for some more ordinary things, like purchasing a few houses around the country and turning them into safe houses. </p><p>But, that was something that needed to be decided before. Instead, I turned my attention to my beautiful assistant, who was watching the four-hundred-meter race with excitement. I had to admit, she looked particularly alluring as she was illuminated by the glow of the screens, her exaggerated sexy hacker getup making her even more alluring. </p><p>It was the time to properly reward her. Even as she continued to watch the race, fascinated, my fingers started moving down her back, my observation proving its usefulness by allowing me to quickly unravel the stress knots. </p><p>I worked faster than I preferred, as the race was merely fifteen hundred meters one rather than a marathon, giving me a limited time before it ended. My fingers danced on her back just like her power did on any computer system, her neck covered by a blush — her hood long pulled back. </p><p>As the race reached its end, I let my fingers move forward and unzipped her hood, revealing her beautiful breasts. “No hanky-panky while working,” she said, which might have been more effective if she hadn’t pushed her arms back at the same time, allowing me to pull off her hood easily. </p><p>“It’s a good thing that we finished working, then,” I said. “That was the last race.” </p><p>She whimpered. “Already. Maybe we should play some more. It was … fun. Who knew that gambling was such fun.” </p><p>I chuckled even as I cupped the underside of her breasts, caressing her expanse playfully. She whimpered. “No. Without the advantage of those illegal tips about the matches, our job will be much harder,” I replied. “Still, it’s good to see that it worked even better than we expected. We have made a lot of money.” </p><p>“For your boss,” she gasped. </p><p>“Well, indirectly. Apparently, my mission parameters changed, and this, along with any other money I could collect, will be my resources. I can keep the rest.” Then, I smirked as I leaned, kissing her neck. “We can keep the rest.” </p><p>“R-really,” she whispered. “I can’t wait to quit my job.” </p><p>That was not allowed, but I needed to handle that delicately. “You can if you wish, but it’ll help very much if you can stay in for a few more days. You can help my mission directly.” </p><p>That made her hesitant despite the pleasure she was feeling. “I don’t know,” she whispered. “Helping you is one thing, but helping a villain during their mission…” </p><p>“Even if that mission is saving a hero from the hands of the villains?” I asked. </p><p>“Really,” she gasped in shock. </p><p>“Yes,” I answered even as I let my fingers move up, and capture her nipples, teasing them gently. “I promise.” </p><p>“Why would your boss want that? Don’t tell me that he’s secretly good?” </p><p>“God no,” I answered with a chuckle. I could have possibly convinced her about it if I worked enough, but there was no benefit. “It’s just that the Syndicate is forcing the hero to create a lot of weapons, flooding the black market. He just wants to keep the prices up.” </p><p>“That’s better,” she whispered. </p><p>“Yes, and the reward is even more incredible,” I said. “He promised that, if it’s allowed, I can actually get independent from him, and act as a mercenary. It would mean I can pick my own missions.” </p><p>“Would you be free?” she asked excitedly. </p><p>“Not fully. I’m sure there would be some missions I would have to accept, but he would be much more lenient,” I said, giving her a story that mostly aligned with what I had told to Daria. The closer the stories they had, the easier it would be to keep it together. “And, once I’m free, there’s nothing preventing me from giving my genius secretary a bonus based on how much value she generates.” </p><p>Then, I leaned forward, kissing her shoulder even as I let my finger trail down, and caressed her wetness over her yoga shorts, which might as well be nonexistent as far as my touch was concerned. “Not to mention, the side benefits —” </p><p>She silenced me with a sudden, heated kiss. I let her do so even as she pushed me to her bed, and sat on my lap, humping me desperately. “I accept,” she whispered, making her recruitment even more official. My hands shifted up and cupped her breasts while she returned to the kiss. </p><p>Her kiss was more aggressive than usual. Normally, I liked to take control, but even without my power, I could feel that she wanted to prove something. And, to celebrate her recruitment properly, I decided to let her. </p><p>So, I obediently kept my hands on her naked breasts, caressing and teasing her while letting her control the pace. She rocked on my lap as desperately as she kissed me, her moans spectacularly beautiful. “Worthy of a secretary of a shady mercenary,” I whispered. </p><p>She moaned even louder as her hips turned wild, pushing herself toward a climax aggressively. Even without my aggressive intervention, she soon climaxed, her wetness exploding to drench my pants. “It’s an excellent role, sir,” she whispered as she put her head to the nook of my head, nuzzling. “But, I remember you talking about the perks. It won’t be a proper orientation without giving you an orientation.” </p><p>That earned a chuckle as I flipped her to her own bed, and ripped her yoga pants. Her gasp of desire was beautiful. I quickly freed my shaft, and without wasting any more time, invaded her core. “This is one of the many perks you’ll have working for me…” I whispered as I drilled her hard and fast. I would have liked to tease her a bit more, but after working for hours, she was already exhausted. </p><p>So, after a quick explosion from both sides, I lay next to her, embracing the sleep. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“The food,” I said as I extracted myself from the hug a while later. “It’ll get cold if you don’t eat it immediately.” </p><p>“You’re right,” she said as she sat on the floor even as I served her the food. “How about you?” she asked. </p><p>“Don’t worry, I already ate while preparing,” I said. She looked at me questioningly. “I didn’t know if they would allow me to stay with you once I brought the food,” I said, then looked toward the formation as if I expected it to create a gate for me to leave. It did not. “It looks like they want me to stay. Perfect,” I said with a big smile and fed Aisnam directly. </p><p>She blushed. “Stop, they are watching,” she muttered but didn’t actually stop me. </p><p>“So,” I said with a shrug. After I glanced at her for a while, I acted like I had just noticed the pile of books in the corner. “What’s that?” I asked. </p><p>“They are for you,” she said. She blushed a bit before continuing. “I arranged all of them as a gift for you.” </p><p>I would have teased her for stretching the truth for a bit, but I was too busy gasping at the system result. Almost two hundred notifications. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 60; Pampering Bonus - 85 (Capped)]</p><p>[145x Return - Six Slash Dead Sword, Cultivation Technique - Black-Low Grade]</p><p>[145x Return - Endless Flame Alchemy Technique - Yellow-Peak Grade]</p><p>…. </p><p>[145x Return - Great Wave Sword Control Technique, Cultivation Technique - Black-Peak Grade]</p><p>[145x Return - Endless Sea Foundation Building, Cultivation Technique - Black-High Grade]</p><p>“You’re the best,” I stammered, and not even teasing her. She had just given me more than a hundred complete manuals, across every topic, covering everything from combat techniques to gate construction. There were multiple books for alchemy, formations, talismans, and even beast taming. Meanwhile, there were multiple combat techniques for eight main weapons, namely sword, saber, spear, staff, bow, fist, palm, and kick. </p><p>A treasure trove indeed. What I had would probably rival the libraries of some of the sects, and I doubted that any would just let others control those techniques. </p><p>A fascinating output. Now, I just needed to find a way to recycle them efficiently. </p><p>Once we finished with the food, Aisnam returned to practicing her Tsunami Palm Technique. Luckily for me, at this point, she was quite used to my questions interrupting her training, and had no problems teaching me. And, since she had already reached Major Accomplishment, her teaching was very efficient. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 60; Pampering Bonus - 85 (Capped)]</p><p>[145x Return - Furious Palm of Nine Tsunami - Beginner, Minor Immersion]</p><p>An excellent reward. I decided to reward her by carefully pulling the other palm techniques from my inventory and making them appear in front of her, once again encased behind a Qi screen that prevented her from talking to them. </p><p>“T-that’s … incredible,” she gasped as she started examining the other techniques, overwhelmed by the opportunity. Meanwhile, I had pulled the other books from my inventory and spread them across the other hills. There was no point in keeping them in my inventory at the moment. </p><p>Asking Aisnam’s help while I guided her to the other hills during a tour was a much better opportunity. However, I wanted to leave that for later. For the moment, I wanted her to study Palm techniques as much as possible. The more expertise she developed, the easier it would be for her to learn. </p><p>While she studied, I left the formation to get her some tea, and once outside, I activated the skill I received, knowing that it would only hasten her learning further. Of course, the bonus from Minor Immersion was nothing compared to the constant inspiration from that gate, but every little bit counted. </p><p>With the Furious Palm Nine Tsunami added to the mix, I was the proud expert of three different techniques. Moreover, I realized something fascinating. Thanks to the combined expertise of the three, my ability to understand palm techniques improved. </p><p>I was holding an incomplete palm technique manual in my hands which I had purchased. I had been holding it mostly for show, not expecting to understand anything, as it was missing quite a bit. Yet, once I processed the Furious Palm technique, the technique started to make sense despite missing portions. </p><p>“Excellent,” I muttered. While I wanted to use the System to cheat as much as possible, the ability to handle them directly was still a valuable benefit. Ideally, I wouldn’t need any, but like it was with everything, it was better to have and not use than the reverse. </p><p>More importantly, it could benefit Aisnam directly. Once I improve, I could write some guides for her, which she could use to improve further, until she reached at least Perfection in multiple weapons. </p><p>I didn’t forget that she still needed to fight against a Foundation Establishment cultivator, and my most recent experience showed just how big of a challenge it was. Of course, I had every intention to sabotage that fight and let her win, but the more eye-catching her abilities were, the more believable her victory would be. </p><p>However, that was for the future. At first, I connected with the formation, trying to observe the presence of the others. The five foundation establishment cultivators still stayed around the capital, and currently, there was no movement around it. </p><p>It wasn’t true for every location. To my surprise, a sizable army of martial artists was leaving Markas and marching toward the nearest city, their speed suggesting that the weakest member was Bone Forging, similar to the Tiger Fist attack. </p><p>I might have been scared if they were moving toward the capital, but luckily, they were moving in the opposite direction, where one of the rebel armies was moving around. Probably some kind of counter-attack, I assumed, but even if they decided to betray, it wasn’t exactly a huge problem. </p><p>At this point, even armies didn’t scare me. There were too many tricks I could pull to protect the people I wanted to protect, especially from growing a nest. Thanks to a combination of the spirit vein and my expanding library, I felt safe despite the escalating danger. </p><p>With that in mind, I returned to Aisnam’s side with a pot of tea. “Hello, my beautiful madam. It’s time for a break,” I said even as I brought her a tea made from spiritual plants. </p><p>“Delicious,” she muttered. “Though, whoever prepared requires more experience. They ruined the leaves,” she commented. </p><p>I shrugged. “Do you want me to warn them?” I asked, acting like I wasn’t the one to prepare the tea. </p><p>“No,” she said. “We’re guests here. It’s better not to mention it.” </p><p>“Does it really make that much difference for Qi-infused tea,” I asked, prompting her to ask. As much as I didn’t care about tea, having the ability to prepare it might be beneficial in terms of my disguise. </p><p>“Of course it does,” she answered pointedly before she started giving an angry but very pointed lecture on appropriate tea preparation … or at least, that was what she claimed. Halfway in, it started to feel more like a philosophy class than a cooking one. </p><p>Though, ultimately, the System agreed with her interpretation rather than mine. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 60; Pampering Bonus - 85 (Capped)]</p><p>[145x Return - Tea Preparation - Beginner, Major Immersion]</p><p>[145x Return - Essence Tea Preparation - Beginner, Perfection]</p><p>[145x Return - Qi Tea Preparation - Beginner, Perfection]</p><p>I shrugged even as I picked up the pot to bring it back. Once I had left the formation, I triggered all three methods, receiving a great deal of information. I had to admit, it was greatly complicated, but even having all that information didn’t suddenly help me. </p><p>Yes, correctly prepared tea had some benefits, but that was true for all kinds of foods and drinks. I still didn’t understand the deal about the tea. </p><p>Ultimately, I shrugged, writing it off as a cultural reverence I was missing. “At least, the next time I prepare the tea, I’ll make her happier,” I said, ready to claim that I had taken the same lessons from the apothecary to impress her. </p><p>Aisnam would appreciate it. </p><p>Once I cleaned the pot, I visited the essence plant garden I had raised, collecting some of the plants that had been forcibly matured thanks to the excess Qi before I turned them into apothecary medicine, wanting to empower the army at the capital even further.</p><p>“I wonder how the cultivators would look if they realized the amount of Qi I’m wasting for essence plants,” I chuckled. However, while it was technically wasteful, it was like exchanging gold for water. No matter how excessive, a man dying of thirst in a desert would always make that trade. </p><p>Once that was done, I visited the capital, raising the cultivation of Aisnam’s shadow guard even further, bringing the number of connote realm martial artists to two hundred, which was truly a shocking number.</p><p>Then, I returned, ready to have another study session with Aisnam. </p><p>It was time for her to take a break from palm techniques. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I couldn’t help but tighten the hold on my dagger even as I looked at the unconscious man in front of me, feeling conflicted about what to do. I wasn’t feeling merciful, as the glee he showed while he planned to kill me, just because of my disrespect of resisting his attack, would have destroyed it even if I was inclined to do so.</p><p>However, that didn’t solve my problem. I was still reluctant to kill him. </p><p>“Well, it’s a problem for later,” I thought even as I moved toward the downed spiritual boat and forced it to miniaturize, lamenting the damage it took. It didn’t look like it could handle another journey. </p><p>Luckily, it was not my only tool. I had summoned my other boat from my dantian before I had tightened the formation around my prisoner, and carried him to the boat before I traveled back. Regardless of my decision about his ultimate fate, a Foundation Establishment cultivator was a source I wasn’t willing to let go. I wanted to interrogate him first. </p><p>However, I wasn’t stupid enough to do so in the middle of misty mountains, famous for its danger. Not to mention, the amount of Qi I could use for formations was limited, and I didn’t trust myself to keep him a prisoner here. </p><p>Markas was a different question. Luckily, with my Black Grade flying boat, I could carry him along. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have dared to drag him with me while walking. Such a journey would last a month, making it too much of a risk. </p><p>I didn’t even search for him while we traveled back, and I made sure to take a wide detour to avoid any itinerant cultivator. An hour later, I was back on the outskirts of Markas. I didn’t bring the prisoner to the spirit vein, or my hiding spot. Instead, I found another cave before building several formations that prevented anything I could think of from summoning artifacts to soul attacks, until I was reasonably confident to imprison even a Golden Core prisoner. </p><p>Only then, did I dare to search him. </p><p>The first thing I had paid attention to was his sword, which was far stronger than any artifact I had ever used. If it wasn’t for the spirit vein, I could never ever dare to touch it, but under the constant flood, I slowly erased his ownership mark. </p><p>When it was completely erased, he spat blood, showing that it damaged his cultivation somewhat. I wasn’t torn up about it. Instead, I started examining the sword, feeling its structure. It was far more robust than any artifact I touched, including the Black Grade Verdant Sword I had used. The reason was simple. </p><p>It was a Foundation Establishment artifact. Unlike Qi Gathering artifacts, they were made for cultivators who could leverage far more Qi with ease. For that reason, I didn’t dare to use it. </p><p>My next target was his storage ring, which, to my fortune, was still a Qi Gathering grade artifact. It was bigger than my System-provided ring, but not considerably so. I decided to give it to Aisnam. </p><p>The contents, on the other hand, were a different issue. </p><p>Erasing his imprint on the ring and forcing the contents to spill was even easier. The first thing I noticed was the riches. A nice pile of spirit stones, more than ten thousand. Several talismans, including some I hadn’t seen, increasing my potential abilities, a few broken artifacts…</p><p>But, most importantly, several technique manuals, including a complete one about gate construction and the Foundation Establishment method. I tried to read it, but once again, it was more complicated than I could comprehend. </p><p>I decided to wake my prisoner up, but before doing so, I added a little illusion of a mist filling the cave entrance. It was better for him to believe that he was imprisoned at Misty Mountains. It would make his situation more believable. I even put a fake formation plate at the entrance of the cave, giving a clear weakness to the formation. </p><p>That way, he would have the hope of escaping. Hopefully, that would be enough to convince him. “Good morning,” I said with an excess cheer as he woke up. </p><p>He blinked as he woke up, then noticed me. “You!” he said as he tried to flare his Qi. Remembering the last time someone had tried that, I adjusted the formation to actually let his Qi infect me, while I made a show of stumbling back. Admittedly, it was only partially a show. His Qi, even when imprisoned, hit hard, trying to overwhelm my Qi. </p><p>But, it was worth it. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 140; Insult Bonus - 240 (Capped)]</p><p>[380x Return - 4,291 Qi Strand]</p><p>Just like that, I almost doubled my Qi reserves in my inventory. An excellent source. </p><p>I made a show of stumbling back and activating the formation plate again, which weakened his Qi attack temporarily. Still, he chose to repeat the trick. This time, I resisted it far more easily. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 140; Insult Bonus - 240 (Capped)]</p><p>[380x Return - 928 Qi Strand]</p><p>I was happy with the result, as it gave me another way to renew my Qi reserves. “If you stopped acting pointlessly, how about if you answer a few questions of mine. That way, I might let you go,” I said. </p><p>“Never,” he answered. </p><p>“Really?” I said. “Even if I promise to let you go afterward,” I said. “After all, you’re a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator. Hardly a threat to me,” I said. He looked at me angrily, but said nothing. “How about if you teach me how to use this?” I said as I raised his sword. </p><p>That earned a mocking laugh. “Like you can even process the true complexity of a Foundation Establishment technique,” he mocked. </p><p>“Oh, really. Why don’t you try me?” I said, goading him further. “Are you afraid that I’m going to turn your sword into my toy?” </p><p>“Arrogant little worm,” he said mockingly. “Try to listen then. The truth of the sword starts with the …” he started, which turned into a sermon. Soon, I could feel my brain getting overwhelmed, almost like it was an attack. He hadn’t been joking. </p><p>I used the formations to weaken his voice immediately, while at the same time, I bit my tongue to act like I was overwhelmed. Still, I looked at him blankly while he continued to deliver the sermon, occasionally trembling like it was affecting me. His method of imparting a technique was certainly not friendly. </p><p>Too bad it was also limited. He paused merely ten minutes later, exhausted. “How was it, little worm,” he mocked. </p><p>It was excellent. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 140; Insult Bonus - 240 (Capped)]</p><p>[380x Return - Blue Wave Sword Control Technique - Beginner, Major Immersion]</p><p>“I … I will come for another lesson,” I stumbled away, acting like I was drunk, making a show of collapsing where he could see … and, if that body was an illusion, he wouldn’t know. As I walked away, I listened to his mocking laughter, happy with his victory. </p><p>As I left him behind, I couldn’t help but smile widely. His sudden appearance forced me into a dangerous situation, but that didn’t mean that I didn’t benefit. Just one technique lesson, and I already received a Foundation Establishment technique to Immersion Realm. </p><p>Still, I didn’t trigger it, keeping it for Aisnam. I could trigger it while she was training her sword techniques, and it would give her even more benefit. </p><p>Before leaving, I made a few changes in the formation defending the cell, adding some fake weaknesses. I wanted him to believe that I was careless, and that he could get away once he struggled enough. </p><p>After all, I needed him to stay confident and arrogant so he could continue to insult me. </p><p>I went back to the hidden valley, and used the formation to transfer all the technique manuals I had acquired to Aisnam, including the foundation establishment technique, and the flying sword technique. I only kept the flying sword for me, knowing that Aisnam wouldn’t gift it back to me, mostly because it would be worthless for a martial artist. </p><p>I watched Aisnam from behind the formation as she went through the technique manuals, trying to see if there was anything for her own use. However, after she had gone through about twenty of them, she stopped going through them. “They are all useless,” she muttered, not even reaching the Foundation Establishment technique. </p><p>Instead, she returned to practicing Tsunami Palm, which was a correct choice. Normally, learning a new technique should have taken weeks for her. And, here, just a few hours later, she had already managed to reach Major Accomplishment, moving four stages successfully. </p><p>Not only that, but I could also see that she had leveraged the abundance of Qi to break through, reaching to ninth stage of Qi Gathering. </p><p>I still waited an hour before I changed to my martial artist look and entered, carrying a tray of food. “Madam. Your loyal servant is here,” I said as I brought her some food. </p><p>“You’re here,” she gasped as she threw herself into my arms, immediately stopping her training. Her arms were even tighter than I expected, showing just how unsettled she was about her current location. Then, she stopped. “Do you know where we are?” she added.</p><p>I shrugged. “No madam. They have just told me that you’re going to fight in Queen’s place, and you might need my assistance. I just followed them when I learned I could help you,” I explained, giving her a readymade excuse about why she was the one working hard to improve rather than the Queen. </p><p>It earned me a kiss in the process. From her expression, it was clear that she wouldn’t have limited herself to a kiss if she wasn’t under the impression that others were watching us … but one couldn’t have everything. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Once I activated the flying boat, I jumped on it immediately and commanded it to fly, expecting the other cultivators to watch helplessly as I got away. After all, damaged as it was, it would require a lot of effort to bring it down. </p><p>Unfortunately, before the boat could even pick up speed, cultivators all around me drew their weapons, attacking the boat simultaneously, trying to take down the boat aggressively. “Fucking savages,” I muttered in shock even as I mentally reached for my storage ring and pulled a stack of shield talismans. </p><p>Truthfully, I wasn’t surprised because of their decision to attack. No, at this point, I had long realized that, for all their supposed exalted nature, cultivators were worse than a drug addicts looking for their next fix when it came to robbery. No, I was surprised, now that they had noticed I had the means to escape, they didn’t waste even a second before violating the supposed peace zone to attack me. </p><p>And, it wasn’t just a few that violated it. No, every single one of them attacked at the same time. It would be one thing if they belonged to the same team, or even coordinated before, but neither was true. </p><p>They simply attacked together, because robbery was truly a reflex for them. </p><p>Luckily, they didn’t belong to the same team, or I would have been truly screwed. Even though everyone attacked me at the same time, and looked like they were putting their best, no one actually pushed themselves to the limit. I could tell thanks to my own expertise in many weapons. </p><p>It was good, because even a portion of those attacks would take down the damaged boat, forcing me to reveal the upgraded version … something I wasn’t willing to commit, as such a treasure might even trigger an action from the sects. I wasn’t ready for it. </p><p>Instead, I pulled a dozen shield talismans, and activated all of them together. A layered shield appeared around the boat, defending me from the attacks. </p><p>“A master,” more than one gasped in shock, which was understandable. Normally, talismans could only be activated one by one. However, my talisman abilities allowed me to bypass that requirement by linking them together, a nice trick I had learned during my last knowledge infusion thanks to the System. </p><p>However, under the attacks of more than two hundred cultivators, even a dozen shields weren’t enough to hold. The attacks rained on the shield one by one, each attack moving at a different speed. The first few shields shattered almost instantly, as the attacks of the stronger cultivators were the first ones to land. I ignored the next wave, and instead forced the boat to start moving. However, rather than going forward, I forced it to move up first. </p><p>At the same time, I raised the dagger with one hand, feeding it Qi, trying to read which attacks would bypass the shield, and preemptively countering them with my own attacks. Those cost me more than a hundred strands, enough to drain most peak Qi Gathering cultivators, but for me, it was just an insignificant part of my reserves. </p><p>“Stop, or we’ll make you pay,” many cultivators shouted as they sent their second wave, but it didn’t matter. I had already picked enough altitude. Even when damaged, the boat was able to move fast enough to dodge the attacks, especially with my own ability to read the trajectory of many different weapons. </p><p>The knowledge of many fighting styles and weapons was coming in handy. </p><p>I still replenished the shields around the boat just in case, even though I didn’t expect anyone to catch up with me as I flew toward the misty mountain. Technically, I wasted treasure worth thousands of spirit stones, but it didn’t matter at all when it came to improving my safety. Who knew if one of them had some kind of super treasure. </p><p>As I successfully escaped, the stronger cultivators decided not to hold back as they chased me, some even using movement arts to keep up with the boat as they attacked, but it was in vain. They might have had a chance if it wasn’t for my weapon skills allowing me to read their attacks, but with it, most of their attacks just flew away uselessly as I dodged them. </p><p>Ultimately, Qi Gathering cultivators were landbound, limiting their methods of attack. I was confident that I would get away freely. “And, that was a good outing,” I muttered. </p><p>However, I must have cursed myself with those words. Merely a few seconds later, I heard a sharp whistle, and before I could react, the first shield layer shattered. Then the second one followed. Third, fourth, fifth…</p><p>It finally stopped when it came to the eighth one, and I was able to see the source. A sword, flying with its own power. Luckily, rather than continuing forward, it pulled back, returning to its owner … who had been floating at the edge of the mist, cutting my path. </p><p>A Foundation Establishment cultivator. </p><p>I recognized him. He was the Foundation Establishment cultivator I had faced the first time I had visited the market. At that time, he was a titan to me. Now, he was a great white shark, smelling blood. </p><p>I cursed myself for my arrogance. Even if it would have wasted my spirit stones, I should have built a formation before coming, but I didn’t expect him to be here, let alone attack. A huge mistake. I still had a lot to learn. </p><p>But, that was for the future. I first pulled shield talismans to refresh the shield around the ship, the endless talismans I had prepared became useful. Then, I pulled a dozen lightning talismans, activating all at once. </p><p>It wasn’t strong enough to kill a Foundation Establishment cultivator, but it didn’t need to be. All I needed was to slow him down while I adjusted my path, trying to escape from him. He responded by raising his hand, and suddenly, and a wave of Qi appeared, trying to drown the flying ship. It wouldn’t take me down, but it would knock me out of my path. </p><p>I responded with twenty flame talismans, forcing the Qi wave to evaporate. It wasn’t complete, but it still weakened significantly. The sword attacked once again, this time even stronger, forcing me to replenish the charms. </p><p>“We will see how many more charms you have!” the cultivator shouted with an anger that shocked me. I didn’t understand why he was acting like I had killed his family. “A mere Qi Gathering cultivator, daring to deny a true immortal!” he added even as he chased me. </p><p>“Ahh, pride,” I muttered in frustration, surprised at the fragility of his ego. Just because I dared defend myself, he was furious. I could see that he wouldn’t stop. “A mere itinerant dog, how dare you speak with this young master like that!” I shouted back. </p><p>I didn’t try to intimidate him, but anger him even further. Since he looked too angry to stop, with a fragile ego to complete, I decided to fuel his anger further. That way, he would make a mistake easily. </p><p>I entered the mist. He followed. I didn’t expect to ditch him, as even with the mist blocking our senses, it had its limits, particularly at the edge. It wasn’t enough to hide a flying boat, or a flying Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p>However, it was enough to keep a weak Qi cultivator hidden. I continued to move, replenishing shields after every attack, while he closed in the distance. </p><p>Then, I found what I was searching for. A pocket of Qi. I let the spiritual boat dip down as I jumped, and let the boat continue. At the same time, I started building a trap formation. The natural Qi pocket hid me. Unfortunately, even with my skills, setting a formation required time. Merely a minute, but during a fight, it might as well be an eternity. </p><p>The anger of my enemy worked to my benefit. He attacked the flying boat twice more. One attack shattered most of the remaining shields, and the other forced the flying boat to the ground. “I finally caught you, you bug,” he said as he lazily floated toward the downed boat, confident in his victory, savoring it smugly. </p><p>He was clearly confident in his superior cultivation. A mistake. Then, he compounded it by flying over the Qi pocket, dragging himself into my trap. I activated it, and suddenly, he found himself wrapped in Qi chains and illusions at the same time. </p><p>“What’s going on — A formation,” he gasped. Then, he laughed. “Do you think a formation plate could hold me back,” he laughed as he forced himself to free himself, shattering the chains. Unfortunately for him, I pulled one of the large spirit stones the system provided, and started reinforcing it. Now that he was trapped, he couldn’t escape. </p><p>“No! How’s this possible. What kind of a formation plate is this!” he shouted even as he fell unconscious, unaware that he was fighting against it in the first place. </p><p>Now, I had a decision to make. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“You’re evil,” I said once Lillian dragged me to the bubbling spring. </p><p>She chuckled. “Is this the thanks I get for helping you,” she answered even as she pulled her shirt up. “Maybe I shouldn’t bother. I’m sure you can find a better way to deal with your mana buildup. Maybe you can try releasing it to the environment.” However, as she said that, she threw her shirt to the side, showing no signs of slowing down. </p><p>“As long as you’re happy dealing with the legionaries checking the valley, searching for the treasure that’s releasing a shocking amount of mana,” I said, not slowing down either. </p><p>“You’re right,” she said with mock teasing even as her skirt pooled around her ankles, revealing her beautiful body. “So, helplessly, I’m going to sacrifice my body to solve your problem. You owe me once again.” </p><p>Her words would have been more convincing if it wasn’t for her extreme enthusiasm as her legs parted open invitingly, her wetness glowing under the starlight. I was quick to replicate her state and crouch between her legs, my tongue out. “Let’s start with pampering you a bit,” I said as I positioned myself between her thighs. </p><p>“R-really,” she whispered, excited yet blushing. </p><p>“Of course. You deserve a reward after today. You have handled Astrid perfectly,” I said. Speaking of her, I could see her approaching us carefully. “Speaking of her, she’s approaching to us.” </p><p>“Really,” she whispered. “I can’t see her.” </p><p>“It’s because she’s better at hiding than spotting your manipulations,” I said, once again glad for the utility of my transformation. Not only I could see her sneaking toward us, but also I could see her expression. So, I knew that she was here for her carnal curiosity rather than any ill intent. </p><p>“Let’s give her a show, then —” Lillian replied, which was all she was able to say before I leaned forward and pressed my tongue. My tongue danced, and her moans exploded. She tasted amazing as my tongue danced. Still, even as she moaned, she wasn’t my biggest source of entertainment. </p><p>No, that honor went to Astrid, scuttling nearer before throwing herself behind a thick bush, not wasting even a second to watch the show. Her desire was a bit abrupt, but not unexpected. After all, not only I had saved her life during the darkest moment of her life, but also she spent the rest of her day slowly being manipulated by Lillian and being carried by me for the majority of the night.</p><p>On top of it, I wasn’t exactly hideous. Altogether, it would be a surprise if she wasn’t crushing on me. Though, I wondered if she had underestimated my eyesight, or forgotten about it in her excitement. </p><p>Either way, it promised an entertaining follow-up. But, that was for the future. Soon, Lillian’s thighs were around my head, blocking my view. I could have asked her to loosen her legs, but it was supposed to be her reward, so it would be rude. </p><p>I focused on her lips, each brush driving her even madder. Soon, she was gasping and moaning until it turned into a spectacular climax. “A good start,” I said as I pulled back, barely glancing at Astrid’s shadow. Not only her head was peeking through the bush, but also her upper body. Unfortunately, she was still dressed, limiting me to her cleavage. Still a spectacular show, but nowhere as spectacular as it could be. </p><p>“Now, beautiful. Do you want it hard … or harder,” I asked. </p><p>“Do you even need to ask?” Lillian answered as she flipped, her ass pointing toward me. I slipped inside without wasting even a second, her wetness greeting me with great fanfare, her walls tight around me. </p><p>I grabbed her flowing blonde hair, turning it into a perfect handle as I started invading her again and again, finally free to make her moan now that we didn’t have anyone else but our voyeur for miles in the distance. </p><p>Lillian either realized that as well, or she wanted to put on a show for Astrid, so her wanton moans were equally explosive as I continued to invade her core again and again. Soon, her arms lost their strength and she collapsed prone. I learned over her, trapping her under me as I continued to invade her body, her arousal turning it into a spectacular dance. </p><p>“Do you want to give her an even better show,” I asked. </p><p>“Yes,” she muttered between her moans. “But, I don’t think I can move.” </p><p>“That’s easy,” I said as I hooked my arms under her legs, easily lifting her as I stood up. With that, her body was in full display as her core devoured me again and again, turning it into a proper entertaining show. </p><p>Luckily, our location had the perfect excuse. I carried her to the bubbling spring and sat down again, keeping her on my lap as I treated her lithe body as a beautiful toy, invading her again and again. Her waist was an excellent leverage. </p><p>Astrid’s moving figure froze, her mouth open in shock, suggesting that she appreciated the show. </p><p>“That’s — perfect,” Lillian gasped as her back arched, showing the trigger of another climax. However, even as she trembled desperately, she accepted the invasion openly, showing how much she enjoyed putting on a show. </p><p>Her legs parted even more, trying to give Astrid the best view. Soon, I reached my own limit and exploded, filling her with both my seed and my mana. “Can you handle another?” I whispered as I hugged her. </p><p>She chuckled. “While I would have appreciated a small break, I don’t want to disappoint our audience.” With that, she twisted on my lap, and started kissing me. </p><p>Well, who was I to refuse such a reasonable request. </p>",

    "content": "<p>The retreat from the border had been a smooth affair. It might not have been the case if the guarding legion alerted to our presence — which was certainly a possibility since Astrid’s enemies were now a part of it — but with my trick with the river able to convince them, we were able to retreat from the border as easily as we arrived. </p><p>Though, we didn’t get too far from the border. As much as it was tempting to get away from the border, one important thing stopped us. We needed a mana-dense location to stay safe. And, only near the border, such a location wouldn’t be occupied. It was why, we only bypassed one checkpoint rather than several. </p><p>In our situation, safety was a relative concept. </p><p>The only challenge was carrying two people at once, and even then, it was more about the leverage than the weight. Ultimately, we solved it by Lillian hanging on my back, while I carried Astrid in a bridal hold. Lillian insisted on that configuration, no matter how much Astrid blushed. </p><p>“Another checkpoint cleared. Now, we just need that mana-dense valley we discovered, and we can actually set up a semi-permanent camp,” I said. “Trying to set up a new camp every day is getting boring.” </p><p>“True,” Lillian said. “Luckily, there was a nice spring there. I need to take a long, relaxing bath. It’ll be perfect. Right, Astrid?” </p><p>“S-sure,” she stammered. “But, shouldn’t we start working on Marcus’ problem first?” </p><p>“She’s right, Lillian,” I said. “Work first, fun later,” I said and winked at Astrid, which didn’t help her blush any. Particularly since Lillian didn’t give her any time to repair her shirt, which meant all night, she had been a very revealing shirt. A fact that she was yet to get used to. </p><p>Even in the dark of the night, the valley was beautiful, but I didn’t let it ignore the deadly nature of it. During our previous visit, I had already detected two third-order beasts the last time I scouted, and I didn’t even go too deep into the valley at that time, just enough to make sure it would make a longer-term hideout. </p><p>There was even a concealed spot where we could build a small cottage rather than continue to live in caves if we decided to stay longer. </p><p>We camped near the spring we had discovered. “Finally,” Lillian chuckled as she jumped down, her feet comfortably on the ground. “Now, what’s the plan. A bath first, or a lesson on magic?” </p><p>“A lesson on magic,” Astrid said immediately, recognizing Lillian’s naughty tone easily after her constant teasing, and preventing her plan from succeeding. </p><p>Or, thinking that she had prevented her plan from succeeding. Unsettled by Lillian’s suggestive tone, she had missed her sharp gaze, and how she manipulated. By creating a situation Astrid wanted to avoid, Lillian had just made sure Astrid would be incentivized to keep that lesson as long as possible. A small, but intentional manipulation I would have missed if it wasn’t for my sharper eyesight, allowing me to catch her expression even in the dark. </p><p>“Why don’t you start with why you hate elemental magic,” I said. “It’ll help us understand your perspective better.” </p><p>“First, I want you both to swear that you’ll never tell anyone about it. It’s a secret of highest order,” she said. </p><p>“I swear on Pluto that I would keep it a secret. May I never walk in his halls if I break it,” I said. As far as the vows went, it was a big one. She nodded in appreciation. Lillian repeated it. </p><p>“It’s going to be a long tale, so don’t interrupt,” she said. “And, don’t argue.” </p><p>We nodded again. </p><p>“It’s because our tribes believe the elemental magic is not something that should exist in nature, but something that was brought to the world by Romans,” she said. “At least, that’s what the secret stories that are only told among the priestesses claim, but the timeline is a bit complicated. Some believe that it was when Rome was founded, while others believe it was something to do with the fall of the last king,” she added. Even as she told so, she was uncomfortable, showing her discomfort in revealing those secrets. </p><p>I caught Lillian’s gaze and nodded subtly, thanking her for her achievement. Earlier today, I had seen just how determined Astrid could be, willing to die for her principles rather than surrender. The fact that Lillian managed to convince her to spill those secrets through friendship in less than a day was an incredible achievement. </p><p>Astrid continued, unaware of our silent communication. “Even if those tales are not true,” she said, her tone making it obvious that she didn’t even consider the possibility, but trying to be kind, “there’s no doubt that our sacred magic doesn’t mix well with elemental magic,” she said. </p><p>“How so?” I asked. </p><p>“In two ways,” she said. “It’s impossible to tame a beast that’s tainted by elements directly,” she said. I quirked my eyebrow, as I distinctly remembered her riding a third-order elemental wolf. “It’s possible to command them directly,” she explained. “But, it’s an active battle, and sooner or later, they snap out of control, making it a dangerous challenge at best. Not like the immaculate beasts,” she said. </p><p>“And, why was your tribe wasn’t using those beasts,” I asked, curious. </p><p>“I thought I said no questions,” she said, but she looked a bit frustrated. “If you must know, our tribe wasn’t the strongest even before the betrayal. We didn’t own one of the holy lands, untainted by the elemental curse.” </p><p>“My apologies,” I said, and she nodded. “You said there were two ways.” </p><p>“The other relates to chosen warriors,” she said. We looked at her blankly. “Shapeshifters, as your people call them,” she continued. “In order to embody their elevated forms, they require the essence of an immaculate beast. There had been some tribes that tried to use tainted beasts for it, but…” she shivered. “Let’s just say it ended badly.” </p><p>That was not exactly good news for me, but nowhere near enough to make me panic. After all, ultimately, I was not a shifter. </p><p>“And, how does the shifters are made,” I asked. </p><p>“Why are you asking that question?” Astrid countered, surprised by my words. “Don’t you know it already?” </p><p>“I don’t fully remember what happened. I wasn’t in a good state back then,” I said, deflecting the question, not sure how much to reveal during the process. It wasn’t a good deflection.</p><p>“Yes, finish the explanation so we can have a bath,” Lillian joined in as she put her hand on Astrid’s leg, distracting her better, once again helping me in a way I hadn’t expected. </p><p>“There are two main ways of annotating a holy warrior,” she said. “The first way to use the living essence. The warrior lives with the immaculate beast for months while the essence of the beast is slowly grafted into his body. It’s the superior way, allowing the warrior to slowly grow into his powers. Only by that way, they have the ability to slowly grow into their power, and change back.” </p><p>She took a breath before continuing. “The second method is easier in the application. Rather than using the living essence, it’s possible to graft the solidified essence of a deceased beast to the body directly. That way, a warrior could be elevated in power in a few months.” </p><p>“I’m guessing that there are some drawbacks to that method,” I said, ready to listen to them. Clearly, that situation was relevant to me. The dragon heart certainly qualified as a solidified essence. Of course, that created a lot of other implications, like the fact that dragons might be actually real beasts rather than legends as I had previously thought. </p><p>But, before I could delve into that question deeper, Astrid waved her hand. “Oh, I wouldn’t worry about it,” she said. “I don’t know why you can’t remember the process, but your situation is clearly the first case. Only the transfer of the living essence could grow and change with the passage of time. And, since your scales are growing slowly, it clearly belongs to the first category. You should be able to handle it easily as long as you can learn the proper magic to suppress your inner beast.” </p><p>“That’s good news,” I said. I didn’t think that it would be that easy, but it still looked like a worthwhile first attempt, especially since we didn’t trust Astrid enough to reveal our more dangerous secrets. “And those suppression techniques, are they difficult,” I asked. </p><p>“They are not, but they require me to create some rituals. It’ll have to wait until I recover my mana, and I need to make some preparations.” </p><p>“We can help with that if you join us in the bath,” Lillian offered as she grabbed my arm and started dragging me toward the spring. </p><p>“I … It’s not necessary, the valley has more than enough,” Astrid answered, her blush back with a vengeance. </p><p>“Your loss,” Lillian said as she dragged me away like a toy, one that she offered to share. It was amusing enough that I let her. </p>",

    "content": "<p>The patrol was boring, with no notable events. In other words, the best kind of patrol, particularly since we had already achieved our mission. </p><p>However, when I returned, I was met with a surprise. Lillian and Astrid, sitting side by side, gossiping like idle maids as they giggled while Astrid was braiding Lillian’s hair in a very complicated pattern that looked wild yet regal at the same time. </p><p>I was impressed. When Lillian promised to handle Astrid’s hostility, I was expecting a grudging acceptance. Not … whatever that was going on. </p><p>“You two look chipper,” I said as I arrived. </p><p>Lillian chuckled and waved. “How do I look?” she said as she gestured herself. </p><p>“Nice braid,” I said, then paused. Her outfit was different as well. </p><p>She noticed my gaze and giggled, which was clearly fake. “Well, since your needlework is horrid, Astrid was kind enough to adjust my clothes a bit,” she said, then stood up to show off her new clothes. She was right about my skills, as while I knew some needlework, I was far from a tailor, and what I created could best be described as oversized sacks. </p><p>Astrid clearly had far more skills in that aspect. The clothes were still made of leather and fur, which could hardly count as finery, but whatever Astrid had done managed to elevate them. Right now, those clothes looked less like functional travel clothes, and more like something the captured slaves would wear during a gladiatorial show. The outfit, a midsized skirt with a slit, and a top with strings, which Lillian left loose enough to create a deep cleavage, was sexy enough to show off every curve, while still distinct enough to look like a tribal warrior. </p><p>“Amazing work,” I said. Lillian smirked knowingly while Astrid blushed, though I noticed that she was sitting a bit weird, slouching excessively. </p><p>“Wait until how my new best friend looks. She looks even better than I do,” Lillian said as she took a step back, and grabbed Astrid’s arm, who slouched even more, her blush rivaling her hair once more. Yet, when Lillian pulled her arm.</p><p>Astrid didn’t resist, instead, she stood up, showing that she was wearing a matching outfit, a knee-length skirt with a slit, and a shirt with strings on top. However, unlike Lillian, the strings were tightly tied, leaving no hint of cleavage. </p><p>Just as Astrid looked at me, Lillian waved her fingers, and a thin line of water coalesced in the air, cutting the strings. </p><p>The first was technical. While a water blade was hardly an impressive trick, the speed she was able to gather the water from the air was incredible, showing that her power once again took a significant leap during her meditation. Every day, she was getting stronger. </p><p>Astrid’s reaction was equally shocking. Earlier today, she was treating the mere existence of elemental magic as a rabid beast that needed to be destroyed. Yet, when Lillian used a spell on her as a prank, she blushed shyly as she tried to cover her chest. And, even then, when Lillian grabbed her wrists gently, she stopped, showing that I had underestimated the progress she had made softening Astrid. </p><p>Then, there was the last point. Astrid was a beautiful woman with certain assets. And, cutting every string of her top showed those assets in an alluring light. A very alluring light. It would be a lie to say that I wasn’t tempted even discounting my new set of instincts that made those primal desires far stronger. </p><p>Yet, it was Lillian’s gaze that surprised me. Instead of an angry glare, I found an expectant one, like she had just given me a present. I caught her gaze, and she smiled, miming me to speak. </p><p>“Beautiful dress,” I said with a throaty tone, letting a tempting smirk appear on my face, flirting hard. </p><p>Astrid blushed even more under my smirk. “T-thanks,” she managed to mutter before she pulled her hands from Lillian. “I think I’ll check if everything is in order before we start moving.” A very bad excuse, considering our possessions were very limited to make sure we stayed mobile. </p><p>I waited for her to walk away for a bit before I turned to look at Lillian. “Mind explaining what was that,” I said. </p><p>“You seemed to like her so —” she started with a saucy smile, but under my sharp gaze, she fell silent. “Alright,” she said, her tone serious. “You need to seduce her,” she said, then a mutter followed. “Not that you’ll have to work hard.” </p><p>“Why?” I said, but from the way she explained, something tickled me. A soft blush, one that didn’t imply jealousy, but desire.</p><p>Intriguing, but I didn’t confront her about it directly. </p><p>“Two main reasons,” she said. “It’s a good way to get close to her, so eventually, she will trust us enough to not want to return to her homeland. With that risk gone, we can trust her with some of the trickier aspects of your condition.” </p><p>“And, you think we can convince her not to return,” I said. </p><p>“Yes,” she said. “She told me her story. Her tribe is basically gone. Apparently, the mage that was chasing her had decided to betray them and join the legion as an auxiliary force. Apparently, he also managed to convince their tribe’s strongest. Anyone that didn’t agree with his decision was dealt with. Astrid managed to escape using the mount of their old chieftain, but most of it was gone. She wants to return back to her lands to convince the other tribes to fight against her old tribe…” </p><p>I shook my head. “They will either force her to join them, or just sell her back to her old tribe depending on the situation,” I said. “It’s a suicide mission.” </p><p>“Exactly. And, once you seduce her, it won’t be hard to convince her that we are the better option to take revenge.” </p><p>“As long as she can help solve my problem,” I said. </p><p>“Exactly. I have no idea what’s going on with you, but I don’t think you’re close to your limit. Once we solve your problem, you’ll be strong enough that dealing with a tribe weak enough to sell themselves as an auxiliary force will be trivial.” </p><p>“As long as I can survive,” I completed. </p><p>Her expression tightened. “We’ll make sure that you can survive. I didn’t question her too much about the details, but from the little she revealed, I’m confident that her information would help to control the transformation at least.” </p><p>I sighed. “I hope so. And, what’s the other benefit.” </p><p>That made her blush. “We … we need to keep your mana levels low, and I don’t think I can do it alone. If you seduce her, she can help.” </p><p>“That would require her to know about mana generation. Not something I will trust her with immediately, if ever,” I said, which was the truth. The last thing I wanted </p><p>“Not a problem. I already have an excuse ready. Not every person has the same efficiency in absorbing the environmental mana. We could just say that you have such an ability, and as a side effect, it makes mana easier to control. It’ll have the same effect, but you’ll be doing her a favor … by hugging her every night.” </p><p>Her blush was spectacular as she said the last part, confirming my suspicions that, for some reason, she was actually enjoying the idea. Not that her excuses were false, but that didn’t change the reasons she wasn’t ready to voice. </p><p>“Alright, you convinced me. If she’s receptive to the idea, I’ll do it.” </p><p>She chucked. “Good,” she said as she walked away, chuckling as she did so. As she walked away, she started muttering to herself, forgetting my enhanced hearing. “If she’s receptive to the idea … blind idiot. As if any girl can resist him after he valiantly saves their life. She can hardly stop herself from throwing herself.” </p><p>Her words were amusing, but not as much as the desire I could hear in her tone. I had no idea why me and Astrid together excited her so much, but with everything else going on, I wasn’t going to look a gift horse in the mouth. </p><p>I might be dealing with the chase of a mysterious organization and an even more dangerous disease … but at least it wasn’t a boring adventure. </p>",

    "content": "<p>There was no working around the fact that I needed money. A humongous pile of it. Not just for my own purchases — though they were vital — but also for Daria. </p><p>She was clearly above attacking me for money, if she wasn’t, she would have been living in luxury. I wouldn’t miss the chance to buy her goodwill by providing her some much-needed cash. </p><p>Funding her lifestyle wouldn’t be too difficult, but the same wasn’t true for her heroic activities. Their ambitions required a lot of cash to support properly. While funding them completely was not an option, even small but timely support could help me make inroads with not just her, but the others. </p><p>With that in mind, the moment the bar was closed, I put on my disguise once more to visit Emily. I wanted to start making money, and the combination of our powers should give us the boost we need. </p><p> The easiest path was to hack people’s bank accounts. The combination of our powers was very promising for it. However, I decided against it. For the scale I wanted, it wouldn’t work. It would be noticed. And, I didn’t want anyone getting ideas about the potential of my power combined with Emily. </p><p>The stock market was potentially tempting as well, but I had no doubt that there were many safety measures there to prevent market manipulation by superpowers. Exactly what kind of things, and what they would catch, I had no idea. And, I would avoid it until I had some. </p><p>“As far as the scale goes, I’m nothing more than a speck,” I muttered even as I moved into the city, ignoring the dangers of the night. “Like a rat … no not like a rat, but an ant,” I added, suddenly smirking. All the stories I had read about money laundering and shell companies finally gave me an idea. </p><p>Emily’s technology power had its deficiencies, her inability to bypass the digital protections one of them, but she had one incredible advantage. Multitasking, is one that I used to my advantage when trying to dig information on people. </p><p>Why not do the same for another reason. </p><p>Opening shell companies to act as the front was a challenge, mostly because it took a lot of time and effort to make them real, and even then, as soon as they grew to a certain size, people started to look at them. Rivals, tax authorities, police, guilds… All gather like flies. </p><p>What if I had a thousand front companies, none with enough operation to actually catch attention. That way, I could actually hide their potential, and Emily could slowly build a presence for them. </p><p>It felt like a viable method, particularly if we could keep the links between them a secret. </p><p>“I’m on fire today,” I muttered even as I climbed the stairs to Emily’s apartment, a smile on my face. Now that I had a way to hide the money — potentially, pending a practical test — I needed to find a way to make a lot of it without getting attention. </p><p>Amusingly, the idea came in the form of a spam message, inviting me to a fantasy football league, offering some sign-in bonus to achieve. My eyes widened to a smirk as I found an excellent method. </p><p>Online gambling. </p><p>Trying to get millions out of a site wouldn’t work. Even assuming that they could pay, it would almost certainly trigger the same kind of protection scheme the stock market had. But, what if we created thousands of accounts across hundreds of sites. </p><p>Even if we failed most of the bets, just the bonuses we would get from signing in would turn a profit. And, with my power, I could pick some sure wins, particularly if I overcharged my power in some tricky situations. </p><p>I started chuckling as I realized the simplicity of it. All the while, I was trying to find a way to make money, ignoring the most excellent method available. This way, I should be able to make a hundred thousand a night easily. </p><p>Not enough for my needs, but certainly a start. </p><p>Even with my power, I couldn’t simply guess the results of the matches, but it was the beauty of it, I didn’t need to. I just needed to beat the odds. Doing so in a hundred different sports events, while Emily put thousands of bets at the same time, would be excellent. </p><p>The best thing, since Emily was using her power, she wouldn’t trigger the usual protections that were there for the bots. </p><p>I knocked on the door with a big smile on my face. Emily opened it immediately, showing she had lingering near the door since she received my call informing my arrival. However, my eyes widened as she opened the door. </p><p>Considering we had spent a lot of time not only fucking, but also recording a high-quality amateur porn movie, I wasn’t expecting her to be in the mood for more sex. Especially since, when I called her and woke her up, I explained that I needed her expertise in hacking. It was very late, enough to be classified as early morning. </p><p>Emily clearly had different ideas, or she wouldn’t have been wearing what she was wearing. She was dressed as a hacker … or at least, what a hacker would look like in a terrible B-movie. One with a lot of unnecessary nudity. </p><p>She wore a hoodie with its hood pulled enough to partially hide her face, which, under normal conditions, hardly qualified as a sexy outfit. She solved that problem by cutting its lower half to turn to leave not only her belly, but also the underside of her breasts naked, which made her lack of a bra clear. </p><p>Underneath, she was wearing yoga pants that strained to the limit, making it clear that they were not designed for someone with her curves. It was tight enough to show that her bra wasn’t the only piece of underwear she neglected to put on. </p><p>It was an interesting mishmash, one that wasn’t supposed to be alluring. Yet, somehow, when combined with Emily’s absurd eagerness, it was enough to make my pants tighter once more, making me glad I hadn’t overindulged with alcohol while working. </p><p>It would be rude to skip. </p><p>“Hello, beautiful,” I said as I hugged her for a kiss, but pulled back when she tried to deepen it. “Work first, fun later,” I said, but even as I said that, I put my hand to her ass, squeezing. </p><p>“I … see,” she squawked, making her even cuter. I led her to her computer setup, teasing her as we walked. Just because I didn’t want to tire myself with some extra fun before trying to see if my plan worked didn’t mean I was not captivated by her seduction attempt. </p><p>So, I kept teasing her even as I explained the details of my new plan, though with an interesting twist. “… And, we’re going to do everything for you, and not just for your boss,” she said. </p><p>“Yes. I’m using one of my boss’s contacts to get some tips, and we will need to pay them quite a bit, but we’re doing it for me,” I said, not just slipping an excuse to keep the money in her control, but also giving a reason to make most of the money disappear as needed. </p><p>With some emotional component that not only explained my need for more money, but also created a hook for the future to ask her help with the purchase of high-power equipment. “Today’s events scared me a bit, and my boss refuses to equip me.” </p><p>“Don’t worry. We’ll handle it,” she said as she leaned against my palm and I caressed her cheek. “I will protect you.” </p><p>She was cute and determined as she declared it. In an amusing twist of fate, I couldn’t even argue her statement of protecting me. Right now, the abilities she was offering were even more critical to me than Tara’s combat abilities. </p><p>What a twist of fate. </p><p>“Let’s start with creating a dozen shell companies to start,” I said. She nodded as she put her hand on the keyboard, which was enough to activate her power. Through that, she started the process of not only creating a dozen companies across a dozen island nations famous for not asking questions, but also building a comprehensive digital presence for them. </p><p>I picked those, because no one would target them, at least for the money we would be making. </p><p>While she worked, I browsed through the different gambling platforms and the events that were currently ongoing, deciding on the platforms and the bets we would be putting for each platform to avoid looking suspicious. </p><p>And, I was already tired. </p>",

While unplanned, the opportunity was excellent, not only allowing me to extract one of the most dangerous time bombs I had been dealing with in her identity as Blue Princess but also giving me a number I could call if the Syndicate decided to break the pattern and bring even more force on me. </p><p>I didn’t expect them to as long as they continued to underestimate me and fear my imaginary backing at the same time. Such a move would be very uncharacteristic for them, but I wanted to be prepared nonetheless. </p><p>One could never have too many trump cards, especially a superpowered variety. </p><p>Of course, getting in contact with a famous heroine had been risky. Frankly, I didn’t know just how well my identity as a mercenary would hold, but it should be possible to arrange something with Emily’s assistance, particularly if she was using the new gear we set up in the basement. </p><p>After all, the stronger the computer, the stronger her abilities were. </p><p>“First step, the bar,” I muttered even as I walked downstairs after a shower. There were no customers yet, but one or two would inevitably appear, to check just how well I had been holding up after their attack. </p><p>Speaking of the attack, I remembered one detail I had missed while dealing with Daria. I needed to hit back to the Syndicate. I didn’t want to confront them, but it didn’t make sense for my mysterious backer to let that attack slide. </p><p>“This is why people stay away from crime,” I muttered even as stood back in the bar, mixing myself a drink. It wasn’t as strong as I needed, but I needed to work all night. Soon, a few customers arrived, looking tense. It didn’t surprise me. No criminal in their right mind would visit a place that had been just attacked. And, since their attitude showed that they were aware of the risks, they were not here of their own will. </p><p>I stayed behind the bar, acting like I played with my phone lazily. In reality, I was doing a sweep of the Syndicate members, hoping to identify them even better. It was hard work, as the higher in the ranks, the less digital presence they had. </p><p>Their friends and families weren’t as careful. As I browsed through a truly humongous pile of photos, school reports, news clippings, and many other documents. It was all public knowledge, as I was still not confident in Emily’s skills to let her hack things without touching, afraid she would leave some kind of digital fingerprint. </p><p>For the effort, I used my power nonstop, but avoided overcharging it. What I had been doing was more like sifting sand for gold nuggets rather than searching for a gold mine. A consistent boost was far more useful. </p><p>Especially since, Emily’s reports got much more accurate. A part of it was learning how to use her improved equipment better, but actually allowing her to </p><p>I wished that I could bring her back to the bar so that she could live here full-time and use the even better computer I had set up for her, but that was not yet possible, for one reason. Her continued access to the guild hall was still a valuable asset, and even if the guild didn’t pay much attention to the actions of their employees too much, I didn’t think they would miss her moving to the den of the villain they had attacked before. </p><p>No, for the moment, she would stay in her own apartment. Maybe after we developed reliable access to the guild, things would change. Her distance was making things harder. What we were doing, for example, would take much shorter if we were working with the multiple-screen setup we had downstairs, and talking directly. </p><p>Luckily, tonight was just about identifying targets, so we didn’t suffer from real problems. </p><p>Whenever she was looking for other things, I was paying attention to my other problem. </p><p>The lack of funds. </p><p>While I still had a lot from the two million I had received from the Syndicate as a ‘gift’, which sounded a lot, it was nothing in the big leagues, whether for villains or heroes — if it was, the New Giants guild wouldn’t have coordinated with the Syndicate to sell illegal weapons across the globe. </p><p>It was not a straightforward problem. The scale was the first problem. The truly functional equipment, rated for the usage of the supers, or designed to resist them, cost a lot. Even the cheapest stuff started from the six figures, and climbed up rapidly. It was also a reason why Daria didn’t call bullshit when I mentioned the job having a twenty million dollar payout, with a potential for further bonus. </p><p>It was just the scale the game was played. </p><p>However, if it was just the scale, it would have been easy. Collecting the money was easy. Just rob a few banks, kidnap a few rich people and drain their accounts, and viola. Unfortunately, that brought the next problem. How to purchase the said equipment. </p><p>In general, there were two channels to acquire equipment. The high-tech companies, sanctioned and overseen by the governments and the guilds together — mostly the guilds, with the government more of a pawn — and the black market. </p><p>Unfortunately, purchasing the equipment legally was a true hurdle. Not only did the money have to be squeaky clean — which either meant legal sources or excellent money laundering — but also the purchaser had to have an impeccable background to even have a chance of receiving it. Then, they had to prove their track record of responsibility, prove their ability to not damage the public, and many other hurdles that I didn’t even know. </p><p>The government wanted to keep the destruction of the country to a minimum, while the last thing guilds wanted was for their monopoly to be challenged. It wasn’t a huge surprise that I didn’t even begin to qualify. As an unknown villain that popped out of nowhere, I couldn’t get even get near the restricted equipment. </p><p>That left the other change. The black market. </p><p>Unfortunately, while it was free from the control of the government, I doubted that it was actually free from the control of the guilds. Even if I had any doubts, the fact that the New Giants cooperating with the Syndicate to supply the black market was proof enough. </p><p>That meant, while they might be laxer about the source of the funds and the reputation of the buyer, their concerns about maintaining their control over power were still valid. So, while there was a lot of equipment that could be purchased there, finding something that powerful enough to go toe to toe with top-tier talents was practically impossible for me. Maybe it might not be for a bigger, more established organization, but that was a different issue. </p><p>Then, there were the other problems. The first one was the price. Due to their illegal nature, the black market products were far more expensive. Horses, it was not a flat multiplier, like everything costing double. </p><p>For example, a laser rifle that could bypass some of the weaker damage resistances could be found relatively easily, and purchased not too far away from public price — still easily costing somewhere around a hundred thousand officially, and two hundred on the black market — but a power armor like the one that attacked my bar would probably cost ten times the official price, maybe even more. </p><p>I couldn’t even imagine just how much money the Syndicate was making through their illegal sales. </p><p>Then, even with all the price differences and the difficulty to contact, there was no guarantee of quality, or even delivery. It wasn’t rare for the seller to disappear once receiving the product … almost as common as the buyer tracking down and attacking the seller to recover their funds after the purchase. </p><p>Safety was not exactly one of the core features of the black market, and my enmity with the Syndicate made it even more of a challenge to use. I needed to be very careful if I used them. </p><p>I started to wonder if there was no other option. Like, using Emily’s access to the guild to put some fake orders in their name, or at least find a way to copy their credentials. It couldn’t work for bigger issues, but I should be able to get away with some smaller purchases like truly effective cameras. As long as I used my own funds to pay for the purchases, it should be doable. </p><p>That, of course, left the next problem. </p><p>Making money. </p>",

    "content": "<p>When Aisnam arrived at Spring Palace, I was ready to meet her, but I was wearing my apothecary disguise. “Your Highness, you’re lucky. The higher-ups decided to support you,” I said even as I gestured to her. “Follow me, please.” </p><p>She didn’t look convinced, but considering the situation, she didn’t complain even as we moved toward the tunnel. As we moved, I activated the formation to create a fake presence for her. I hoped that the cultivators would avoid the building, but even if they did not, the defenses were in place. </p><p>“Won’t they notice my absence?” she asked. </p><p>“Don’t worry, Your Highness. We have already solved that issue,” I answered. </p><p>“And, what about Arthanum?” she asked. </p><p>I barely held back a chuckle, impressed that she thought about my safety even under the circumstances. “He will be brought up to your location later. You’ll need a servant there,” I answered, giving a reason for my current absence and future appearance. I didn’t say anything else, and neither did she, at least for a while. </p><p>She gasped in shock when she reached the other end of the tunnel, only to see a sleek, perfect flying boat burst out. “W-who are you?” she asked in shock. </p><p>“Just as we said, a small organization trying to get a foothold,” I said. “However, the latest development allowed us to get some support from the headquarters. You won’t be able to see where we’re going next,” I added as I gestured for her to step into the flying boat. </p><p>She was hesitant, but the presence of her cousin, who looked ready to murder her, forced her hand. Obediently, she stepped on the boat and put on a blindfold. I put a small formation around her just to be safe, blinding her even further, then started moving. </p><p>The boat not only moved with a shocking speed, but it also did so without revealing any obvious presence. Even without the formation of the region allowing me to completely conceal the presence, I doubted that anyone weaker than Golden Core would have noticed it. </p><p>The speed was fascinating. It took us barely a minute to arrive at Markas. I directed the boat to the small cabin where Pearyin disappeared, but stopped outside. Before asking Aisnam to remove the blindfold, I added another formation, which created a sphere of fifty feet where she could practice. At the same time, I placed the Tsunami Palm into another formation, which would allow her to read but not take. </p><p>It was not ideal, but giving her a stronger technique, hopefully in a location that would allow her to practice further, was the best I could do. </p><p>“You can remove the blindfold,” I said. She did so, and when she did so, she gasped in shock. “This is…” she muttered. </p><p>“A blessed land, where you’ll practice,” I said. </p><p>“Did we teleport,” she asked. </p><p>I nodded, acting like it was a reflexive move, before frowning. “Don’t ask what you shouldn’t ask,” I growled, acting like she had just touched a secret. It was better for her to think that we had teleported than to realize that we were still in her kingdom. “You can practice here. I have already arranged a technique for you. Depending on how much time we have, I’ll try to arrange more,” I added. </p><p>Then, I created a circle. “Anything that appears here, you can take with you, or gift as you wish,” I added. “Arthanum is a good kid,” I added, giving her express permission to do so. Also, by giving that hint, the appearance of some broken techniques and other stuff that she might treat as garbage would suddenly make sense. </p><p>It was a risky move, but from everything I had seen, it should still trigger the System. </p><p>With that, I moved away, leaving her to practice the technique. As much as I wanted to stay and practice with her, I had another task to complete. I wanted to visit the cultivator market. </p><p>I had been looking for an opportunity to visit that place again, this time without fearing for my life, but the distance had been a problem. However, now that I had a flying boat that allowed me to move at a shocking speed, the situation was different. </p><p>I cut through the mortal kingdoms with great speed. However, as I moved, I had a big frown. Even without searching for it, I had seen many armies currently moving, not just at the surrounding kingdoms, but all of them. </p><p>I realized that, in my efforts to conceal what was going on, I might have accidentally triggered a bloody regional warfare. I wanted to feel guilty … but then, I wasn’t the one who decided a war between mortal kingdoms was a perfectly acceptable way of competition. </p><p>“Fucking cultivators, and their pointless bloodshed,” I muttered even as I continued toward the cultivator market, circling widely until I entered the Misty Mountains. Once there, I put the flying boat back in place — its reserves noticeably lower thanks to the journey — changed my disguise into a well-dressed cultivator, and placed my talisman brush noticeably on my belt. </p><p>This time, I wasn’t afraid of revealing some of my talisman abilities.</p><p>However, before leaving the mist, I spent a few minutes refining the boat Aisnam had gifted me, erasing the emergency command she had left in the device — which she did because she still thought of me as a martial artist, therefore unable to use an artifact. </p><p>The boat was about the same size as my own, and still a decent quality. However, just like I had suspected, it was damaged, barely strong enough to handle one or two trips. Still, good enough to extract me from the market if needed. </p><p>Still, I moved to the market on foot. </p><p>As I entered the market, the people had been already gossiping about someone displaying his craft talent openly. I ignored them as I muttered repeatedly. “Just one step, just one step,” I muttered repeatedly even as I walked through the opening. I didn’t buy anything, just glanced. “I almost got it, I just need an inspiration.” </p><p>Then, I opened a stall at the corner, and to a paper that I pulled from my storage ring — using it as an excuse to display my riches — I wrote a list of pricing, much to the shock of people, giving people a list of exchanges, giving a list of talismans for techniques, including ones that were damaged, with missing pages and everything. It must have been a perfect deal for anyone. </p><p>“Hey, are you really exchanging Yellow Grade Talismans for damaged manuals,” someone asked. “Do you even have—” he started, only for me to throw a stack of talismans there. “Yellow-Peak,” he gasped. </p><p>“Yes,” I growled even as I pulled a dagger and sank it on the table. It was an artifact. “I don’t have time to waste. I’m about to break through, and I need inspiration,” I growled, acting as manic as a drug addict looking for his fix. As I did so, I pulled ten strands of Qi from my Inventory and radiated, acting like I had lost control. </p><p>That was enough for the cultivators around me to pull back. Yet, rather than attacking me, people actually started to line up and actually start exchanging their technique manuals based on my prices. </p><p>What I was doing looked absurd at first, and shouldn’t work, but I had some advantages. Cultivators were famous for getting somewhat … irrational, when it came to their power, and getting slightly mad due to the possibility of a breakthrough was acceptable. </p><p>That madness also made my threat more believable. While there was supposed to be no violence at the market, there was no guarantee about the actions of a crazed cultivator when pushed. </p><p>Of course, above everything else, the most important factor was that I was seriously overpaying for the techniques. A Yellow Peak talisman was a luxury, but to the right buyer, it would easily go for hundreds of spirit stones — at least, the broken variants with one Qi strand. People lined up, as no one wanted to miss such an excellent deal. </p><p>A few people asked for offensive talismans, but I refused, limiting myself to shield talismans and other auxiliary benefits, not willing to enhance their offensive capabilities. After all, soon I would need to escape them. </p><p>I pulled more and more talismans from my storage ring, while it slowly got filled with many broken technique manuals. Some were about gate construction, some were about combat techniques, and some were even about various craft techniques, making them even more valuable. </p><p>Just like that, I had made a fortune. Of course, the more fortune I revealed, the more cultivators started watching me, ready to free me from the burdens of riches. Hundreds of cultivators, spread around widely. </p><p>Cultivators liked to say wealth above one’s strength equaled sin. It looked like they were ready to give me an applied display of it. Luckily, it looked like no one wanted to be the first to start fighting. </p><p>As the line came to an end, I shouted. “Is there anyone else?” There was no answer. “I’ll visit again if I can’t attain a breakthrough,” I shouted as I moved away from the market. </p><p>Then, to everyone’s surprise, activated the damaged flying boat. </p>",

    "content": "<p>When I returned to the capital, I stayed outside, observing as Aisnam shuffled the defense. At the same time, I modified the formations I had built, making sure that they would stay hidden from the approaching Foundation Establishment cultivators that were getting closer and closer, as well as the newly embarked Tiger Fist army. </p><p>The flying ship stayed behind, no doubt waiting for an opportunity.</p><p>Curious about exactly how things would unfold, I stayed in place, ready to intervene in case Aisnam needed help. The most recent gift I had received was enough to save Aisnam in case of an emergency. I didn’t know if it was strong enough to hold back the cultivators, but since I could cheat with formations, it didn’t matter. </p><p>The Foundation Establishment cultivators were the first to arrive. One belonged to Kartpa Valley, and one belonged to Entsa Pavilion. Others, I didn’t recognize. </p><p> But, to my surprise, they didn’t enter the capital. Instead, each picked a nearby hill and activated some formation plates to defend themselves. Curious, I approached them, hidden behind my formations, trying to understand what was going on. </p><p>They were holding recording crystals. </p><p>“Interesting,” I muttered as I realized exactly what they were doing. They were here as observers, to make sure the battle was limited to martial artists like it was supposed to be according to their so-called Covenant, like some kind of United Nations observer watching the battles in Africa. </p><p>I didn’t even need to wonder about the reason. With the fake ruins discovered, the importance of the region suddenly increased significantly, probably enough for cultivators to pull even dirtier tricks. The reason for multiple cultivators observing the battle was likely that each side wanted to prevent foul play. </p><p>I examined them. The unknown cultivators were calm, while, I could see that the disciple of Entsa Valley was the only one that was showing signs of her nerves. Kartpa Valley disciple, on the other hand, looked smug, no doubt thinking that their victory was assured. </p><p>Too bad for him that I had stacked the deck otherwise. </p><p>Aisnam had deployed the royal guards to the outer walls, showing her intent to defend the city. Her secret guard, on the other hand, secretly moved to several warehouses near the walls, ready to be revealed as needed. </p><p>While waiting, I started studying the Furious Palm Nine Tsunami Technique once more. And, to my surprise, I made nice progress. Not a lot, but my previous knowledge, combined with the passive learning effect thanks to Pearyin, allowed me to progress much better, giving me hope that, even without the System tricks, I could learn techniques. </p><p>While I was busy learning, the newly embarked Tiger Fist army arrived. The moment they were seen, the Entsa Pavilion disciple looked shocked, showing that she hadn’t been expecting it. Thanks to my formations, I could watch them from a distance. </p><p>She tried to leave her observation spot, but Kartpa Valley disciple moved to cut her off immediately. “Where are you going, fellow cultivator,” he said smugly. “I thought we had a battle to observe. You can’t be thinking about breaking the neutrality, can you?” </p><p>“Of course not,” the woman answered through squeezed teeth, glancing at the other observers. It looked like the only thing that prevented her was the presence of the others. </p><p>I stayed in place even as the Foundation Establishment cultivators stayed locked in place, while the Tiger Fist army moved closer and closer to the city … and suddenly, stopped. Some of them had been carrying huge bundles, and they started to assemble them rapidly, turning them into catapults. </p><p>I smirked as I realized what they were trying to do. Aisnam had explained before. Even as a cultivator, Aisnam had the right to defend the city, but with the Tiger Fist using siege weapons, she had to leave the city. </p><p>A weird technicality, but it looked like they wanted to use it. </p><p>As they set the siege weapons, the Tiger Fist army started to shout many slogans about freeing the kingdom from oppression and other nonsense. I shrugged, not paying any attention to the details. Ultimately, the Tiger Fist army had many Bone Forging experts and more than a dozen Connate Realm martial artists, their lack of organization showed that they were gathered in a hurry. I guessed that they had been living in the schools that were on the path of the spiritual boat, and they had been gathered together in a hurry. </p><p>I had already provided Aisnam with all she needed to fight against an inferior army like that even without revealing her recovery. </p><p>She didn’t disappoint me. Before the siege weapons could even be set up properly, fifty figures departed the walls, and rushed forward, each dressed in long black outfits that covered them completely. They moved forward with the speed of a Bone Forging realm warrior, but I could see that they were Connate Realm artists. </p><p>I wasn’t the only one that realized it. The two flying cultivators that had been arguing earlier had a change of expression, with Kartpa Valley disciple looking like he had just swallowed a lemon. “What a surprise,” he growled. “It looks like your pavilion has been hiding some secrets, fellow cultivator,” he growled, suddenly finding himself in a reversed situation. </p><p>“We have,” she answered, trying to hide her surprise to act like she was aware of it all along. “It’s not easy to take over Zaim Kingdom. Our pavilion is the greatest sect of the continent.” </p><p>“We will see,” he said as he pulled a talisman and activated it. It was a communication talisman. It was easy for me to tap into the communication while he was in my domain. The combined expertise of formation and talisman made it possible. </p><p>The destination was just as easy to identify. It was where Aisnam’s cousin was waiting. The message itself was simple, calling him to arrive at the capital as soon as possible and deal with his cousin. It made the flying ship to suddenly move toward the capital quickly. </p><p>Just not quickly enough to prevent the massacre of the Tiger Fist army. Fifty Connate Realm fighters, even if they were inexperienced, were too strong to deal unprepared. The mismatch had been enough to devastate the Tiger Fist army easily. </p><p>However, before they could even return, the flying ship had arrived, its presence enough to shatter the morale of the city. </p><p>I looked at the ship again. Now that I had something to compare, I could see that it wasn’t a particularly good one. Its only advantage was its size, while every aspect of its quality was inferior to my flying artifact. Not that it was a surprise considering the nature of my cheat. </p><p>However, the shock started when the cousin in question appeared on the ship, floating down in his own power. </p><p>Foundation Establishment. </p><p>I immediately turned my attention to Aisnam, who was at the walls to watch the battle, her face distorting with fear and surprise. </p><p>“Hello, cousin,” the voice of the Foundation Establishment boomed. “It’s time for you to stop shaming our family and return home. Aisnam’s expression showed that it was hot a good thing. The disciple of Entsa Pavilion disciple looked just as shocked. However, she made no move to cut his path, nor did any other disciple. </p><p>It was clear that his identity as a family member allowed him to bypass the rules about the situation. </p><p>I tensed, even as I used my formation to send her a message. </p><p>‘Make a fist if you can delay any confrontation for more than a day,’ I said to her, already thinking of all the ways to handle the situation without revealing myself. I could still take Aisnam away with my flying boat, but that was the last resort. </p><p>I had some ideas that I could use to solve her situation instead. </p><p>She made a fist, no doubt assuming that the message was from her mysterious allies. </p><p>“What a great surprise, cousin,” Aisnam shouted back, looking like she had been struggling from the exertion, still looking like she was injured. “I wonder what brings you here.” </p><p>“Have you not heard me,” he shouted back, his voice turning into an attack that targeted Aisnam. She was strong enough to resist it, but she deliberately received it, which sent her tumbling down from the walls. Her injury might be fake, but it still annoyed me. </p><p>“I’m sorry, cousin. But I won’t be able to follow your order. I’m in a critical period of my cultivation, and I can’t leave here before the formation is repaired. Unless, of course, you’re willing to take responsibility for all damages,” she responded. As she said so, I triggered the formation, and let out a burst of cursed Qi, enough for the Foundation Establishment cultivators to notice to further her message. </p><p>That brought him short. He looked at the other Kartpa Valley disciple, who activated another talisman, saying not to accept it, and that they would arrange a formation expert to visit the area soon. </p><p>It made me wonder once again just what was behind those doors that just the risk alone slowing down their plans significantly. However, my curiosity wasn’t strong enough to try using the technique that was embedded in my brain. I still had some sense of self-preservation. </p><p>“Very well. I won’t hold you back from such an important mission,” he said, his anger palpable. Clearly, he wanted nothing else than to kill her at this moment, but the complete political situation didn’t allow it.</p><p>“Good,” Aisnam said, then looked at her army. “Defend the walls, no matter what,” she ordered even as she mounted a horse and rode back to Spring Palace. The royal guard looked hesitant, but as another fifty black-dressed guards appeared, it stabilized the situation despite the presence of the cultivators. </p><p>I chuckled even as I moved back, wanting to arrive to Spring Palace before Aisnam. </p><p>I needed to work quick to ensure Aisnam’s safety. </p>",

    "content": "<p>When I returned to the capital, I moved to Spring Palace, and quickly penned a letter from her ‘allies’ explaining the latest changes in the region. I wanted to have a talk with Aisnam, to understand the political ramifications of the latest changes, so that I would know exactly what could be done. </p><p>The moment I finished writing the letter, I lit a candle and put it in a prearranged window, which was a prearranged signal that declared her that we needed to talk urgently. She might be in a meeting, but her servants would alert her of that.</p><p>It wasn’t the most urgent alert we agreed on, as few relied on fireworks, but my current one was the highest we had that didn’t include an actual commotion. Therefore, it wasn’t surprising when Aisnam arrived in her servant disguise barely a minute later. </p><p>That delay was welcome, because while waiting for her, I felt the presence of multiple Foundation Establishment cultivators as well, each approaching the capital. I added that information to the letter as well. </p><p>“Madam,” I said with a nod as I passed her the sealed letter. She ripped it open, and read it, which included everything I had seen, including the presence of the flying ship that included her </p><p>“It looks like my cousin is here for another visit, this time as a proper disciple,” she growled, her anger intense enough to make her forget exactly what was going on, enough for her to forget that she was supposed to be the servant. I decided to look outside the window and act like I didn’t hear her. </p><p>Her anger suggested that the cousin in question was the same person responsible for her earlier plight, a plight that she had mostly recovered, but left mental marks. </p><p>However, my ploy didn’t work, as her eyes widened and she realized exactly what she had slipped. “I mean …” she stammered. </p><p>“You don’t have to explain. I know that cultivator families are not kind to their members when they don’t have the potential. It’s not your fault that they forced you to be a servant to a family member, or targeted by others,” I said. “She might be a stronger cultivator and the Queen, but you’re the one I value.” </p><p>Aisnam blushed far more than I expected. “R-really,” she said. </p><p>“Of course,” I said as I crossed the distance and sealed her lips with mine. She moaned under my short yet heated kiss before I pulled back. One danger was dismantled … but many remained. “As much as I wanted to continue, you need to alert the Queen quickly to the developments,” I commented, reminding her about her role. </p><p>“Y-you’re right,” she said as she kissed me again, and looked toward the door. But, rather than continuing forward, she moved upstairs first. When she came back, she was holding a small toy in her hand. </p><p>Only, it was radiating far too much Qi to be just a toy. </p><p>“Here, take this,” she said as she passed it to me.</p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 50; Pity Bonus - 60 (Capped)]</p><p>[110x Return - Personal Flying Boat - Black-High Grade]</p><p>“W-what’s this? It feels … strong,” I muttered, acting like I didn’t know exactly what she had given me. A flying boat. A strong one, considering the return of the System. I was not an expert, but I could feel that it was badly damaged, enough that it would probably last for one use, at most two. </p><p>“It’s a device to enable your escape in case of an emergency,” she explained quickly. “I don’t know what will happen if my family discovered you, but I can’t take the risk,” she said. </p><p>“What about you,” I asked. </p><p>“Don’t worry, I have my own methods to escape, and so does the Queen,” she said. I could see that it was a lie, but I didn’t confront her. As a martial artist, I wasn’t supposed to know about that detail, or even the fact that what I was holding was a very expensive treasure. It was probably her last resort to escape, one last trump card, useful even under the circumstances. </p><p>The fact that she gave it to me showed how much she cared about me. I was touched, enough that I would have probably rejected it … if I hadn’t already done enough to secure her safety even during the approach of the Foundation Establishment Cultivators if the situation got bad enough for her to use it. If the situation turned that badly, I could always intervene as her mysterious ally to save her. </p><p>“I still don’t want to leave unless it’s an emergency,” I said. “I can stay in here, in one of the rooms, and as long as I stay near the basement entrance, they would probably overlook my presence,” I said. </p><p>“No. That’s too risky —” she started. </p><p>“Maybe, but I won’t leave when there’s still a chance I can help you,” I said stubbornly, which, despite how it looked, wasn’t exactly sacrificial. With the hidden formation I set around the capital, I was safe here regardless of the circumstances, and I didn’t want to stay away from her just in case things had degraded too much. </p><p>I could stay yet hide from Aisnam, but I was reluctant to do so unless I had no other choice. Disappearing meant I would lose the chance to trigger the System consistently, which was not something I wanted to miss. </p><p>I needed to get better. As much as formations gave me incredible flexibility when it came to dealing with my enemies, I didn’t ignore the fact that, the only reason I was able to do everything I wanted was the limitless Qi I was able to get from the spirit vein, and, in the process, wasting enough to actually cultivate a small sect if given enough time. </p><p>The itinerant cultivators fought for a dozen strands of Qi, while I spent millions. I would have felt far more confident if the spirit vein could be moved, but unfortunately, that was not the case. And, with multiple sects and families paying attention to the region, I couldn’t even assume that I would keep it forever. </p><p>So, the stronger I got, the better. </p><p>“You’re stubborn,” she said. On her face, I could see the conflict. “Keep the artifact with you, and activate it if you face any danger. I don’t want them to target you.” </p><p>“Would they? I’m just a weak martial artist,” I said. </p><p>“They would love to kill my happiness,” she said as she hugged me. “I need to go, I need to deal with the emergency.” </p><p>I nodded, and she left the room, returning to her throne room to arrange the defenses. The moment she went out, I left as well, using the tunnel, and soon I was at the cave, which was defended by another formation, strong enough to conceal a similar flying ship I had seen earlier. </p><p>I reached the System space, and pulled the boat, which, once again, came out as a miniature, which, unlike the one Aisnam gave, had no presence. However, I knew that, it was the quality of the System provided tool, preventing leaks. </p><p>Just like any other artifact, it came out fully refined, so all I needed was a mental command for it to turn full-sized. “Fascinating,” I muttered. </p><p>The first thing I paid attention to was the size. After the previous flying ship, I expected it to be another giant device, hundreds of feet long, but it was merely thirty feet. It looked like it was designed for personal use, more similar to a sports car than a cargo ship. </p><p>A very high-end sports car, even, I thought as I examined the sleek brown surface, made from a wood I didn’t recognize, but smelled amazing, inlaid with some complicated patterns that reinforced the surface. On each side, there was a bow that looked like an artifacts, giving the boat some offensive capabilities, and there was a Qi shield around it to defend against attacks. </p><p>The only problem, even as it stood still, I could feel it devouring its Qi reserves with a noticeable speed. It was luxurious and spectacular, but cheap, it was not. </p><p>Luckily, as long as I had the spirit vein, I didn’t lack Qi, and with the giant formation spreading around the capital, linking it to the boat to constantly provide it with energy was trivial to someone with my expertise.</p><p>To test it, I tried to miniaturize the boat, and not only it was easy, it actually moved to settle in my dantian. </p><p>“Convenient,” I muttered, ignoring the desire to use it for its virgin voyage, and instead returned to the capital. Not only multiple Foundation Establishment cultivators were getting closer, but also the Tiger Fist army, though Aisnam’s family member stayed away for the moment. </p><p>Still, it was good to know I had to tools to extract Aisnam safely if things had gone worse than I expected. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Welcome to our temporary camp,” I said an hour later, after taking another complicated route. It wasn’t as complicated as I would have taken if I wasn’t planning to abandon the camp immediately, but still enough to waste quite a bit of time. </p><p>Lillian was still in the cave, meditating. As I approached, I made several quick sounds, giving one of the signals that we agreed upon, asking her to come out the moment she could handle without sacrificing her gains from meditating, which, ideally would only take a few minutes, but could extend to half an hour depending on the point where she was in vitae condensation. </p><p>I stopped some distance from the cave entrance, thinking about how to handle Astrid. Finding her a proper outfit was vital. Luckily, we had prepared a few. </p><p>However, before I could even let her down, Astrid looked around for a few seconds, then suddenly tensed as her gaze turned to the entrance of the cave. “There’s an elemental mage here,” she growled, almost spitting out as her arms and legs tensed around me in anger. Then, she let go and landed on the ground. </p><p>I focused on her anger rather than the way her body reacted to that sudden move, but with the way she dressed, it was a close call. “And, that’s a problem, why?” I asked. She looked frustrated. “She’s an important ally and her presence is vital,” I told her. </p><p>“You expect me to work with a heretic,” she asked. </p><p>“Yes,” I said. “You have to suffer the indignity for a while.” She looked extremely frustrated. “Why does it matter? I know your people use elemental magic as well. Not as much as Romans do, but it’s hardly rare.” </p><p>“It’s because those tribes lost their true ways and picked the path of the heretics and desecrators,” she said. I had no idea where her anger toward the elemental magic was coming from. </p><p>My best guess was it was a reflection of the constant warfare between the tribes and Rome, both the Empire and the Republic, but it was just a guess. And, it didn’t matter much. I could see her conviction shining in her gaze, which implied that she wouldn’t change her opinion by a few words. </p><p>“We might talk about it later, but her presence is not subject to your approval,” I said sharply. “You just need to help me for a few weeks and guide me through my problems, and your debt will be paid.” </p><p>“And if I don’t,” she asked, her tone challenging. </p><p>I paused. I didn’t know if she would take it as a deal breaker, but either way, Lillian’s presence, with her healing abilities and druidic secrets, was vital. “Then, you can leave and try your luck whether you can last by yourself,” I said. </p><p>“You would leave me alone in Roman territory. It will be a death sentence,” she said. </p><p>I shrugged. “Maybe, but it’s not like you’re my responsibility. You were already on this side of the river when I saved you from almost certain death. The rest, I’m offering a simple trade.” </p><p>She paused, her frustration flaring. I didn’t say anything, waiting for her to decide. While I was an expert on many things, negotiations, and diplomacy were certainly not a part of those. Still, I didn’t even bother convincing her to wait until Lillian could finish her meditation. The reason for it was simple. </p><p>Despite my complicated situation, I was an elemental mage as well. A disabled one, but still the point stood. And, considering the nature of the assistance we required from her, I doubt that we could hide that fact from her forever. Sooner or later, it would come out. And, if she found the presence of elemental mage abhorrent enough to risk almost certain death, she would never help me. </p><p>Her silence stretched for a long time, and I continued to look at her eyes. Her determination was impressive, but I had been raised in a household hostile to my whole being. The angry glare of a beautiful woman could never dissuade me. </p><p>Particularly since I was still getting a show from the corner of my eye. </p><p>“On one condition,” she said. </p><p>“State your condition,” I replied, hoping that it was not a difficult one. </p><p>“One week. I’m going to help you one week, and once the time is up, you’re going to help me cross the river.” </p><p>“A month,” I countered. She looked ready to argue. “And, not only I’m going to help you cross, but also I’m going to make sure you replenish your mana and your equipment. I’ll also help you capture a second-order beast at the other side so you won’t be defenseless.” </p><p>She looked torn up about the offer, but ultimately nodded. </p><p>“Good,” I said. “And, speaking of equipping,” I said as I walked a bit, where we kept our meager possessions and pulled a cloak. “Let’s start with something more substantial to wear.” With that, I threw the cloak at her. </p><p>She looked confused at first as she grabbed the cloak, but that lasted only for a second. She looked down, which was enough to remind her of the state of her clothing. The blush she sported was spectacular, matching the color of her hair even as she wrapped the cloak around her body in a hurry. </p><p> I couldn’t help but chuckle. Seeing her react like that was just too amusing when compared to her unyielding stance earlier. She said nothing, blushing as she turned away, keeping her cloak around. The silence ruled the opening for a few more minutes until I heard footsteps. </p><p>Lillian walked out. “What’s going on?” she asked once she noticed that we weren’t alone. Astrid looked at her with an angry gaze, as if she was at fault for her situation, but said nothing. </p><p>I gestured for her to take a seat on a nearby rock. “This is Astrid, and she’s a priestess,” I said. </p><p>“You’re kidding, right?” she said. </p><p>I pushed my fingers through my hair, feeling amused. “Oh, I know how it sounds, but wait until you hear the whole story,” I said before telling her the whole story, starting from my meditation mishap. </p><p>“That sounds like an incredible coincidence,” she said. “Or not…” </p><p>I frowned. “Do you think it’s a trap? It’s impossible. Even assuming that we failed to ditch them, it’s impossible for them </p><p>“No, but what if there’s something else. Something divine?” </p><p>I shrugged. I was never a fervent follower of the gods, and the fate was even more complicated. “Maybe, but if it’s the case, there’s not much to think about. If gods wants to help us, we’ll take it. And if they want to hinder us…” </p><p>She sighed. “We have no choice but to take it,” she completed. </p><p>“Exactly. Let’s talk about something more practical,” I said. </p><p>“Yes, like her hostility toward elemental mages. Any idea why?” I opened my mouth, but she didn’t allow me to interject. “Other than the heretic comment, of course,” she followed. </p><p>“Then, I have nothing,,” I said. “It’s not like we were able to talk a lot,” I said. “I’m lucky that she’s amenable to making a deal. A month of her time is far more than we hoped for.” </p><p>“What if a month is not enough,” she said. </p><p>I chuckled. “Then, we’re going to hope that the gods are willing to grant us another boon,” I responded. ”That, or we will make her another offer. After all, while we were lacking when it came to coinage, we can always offer mana plants and help her tame high-order beasts.” </p><p>“I’m not afraid of that part. Her hostility is the bigger problem,” she said, looking at her for a moment, then turned to me. “What are you planning to do?” she asked. </p><p>“Since we’re going to pass a couple checkpoints, we can’t start moving until the night,” I said. “And, after the latest debacle, I won’t dare to experiment unless I could find a mana-dense location. I’ll probably patrol to make sure I didn’t bring any enemies to the camp.” </p><p>“Good. Then, I can start working on reducing her hostility,” Lillian offered. </p><p>“Do you think you can?” I asked. “She seemed pretty adamant in her hatred.” </p><p>“We have no other choice. Sooner or later, she has to know about your elemental mage status,” Lillian answered. I sighed. She was right. “Don’t worry, I have spent years dealing with spoiled merchants and nobles with overblown egos. I can handle her.” </p><p>“As you wish,” I said as I stood up, and went for the patrol. Though, just in case, I stayed near for some time, watching them interact. I was too far away to hear them even with my enhanced senses, but reading their body language was enough. </p><p>Astrid started stiff at first, like she was facing a mortal enemy, though that intensity lasted for a few moments. Her sharp expression turned into intrigue, which then softened further when Lillian cut her hand to show her druid magic by making a small sprout grow several inches. </p><p>I decided to go for my patrol. Lillian had the situation under control. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I didn’t say anything for a moment as I stood at the riverbank, watching the raging river, appreciating its majesty as it roared, reassessing the danger. </p><p>I had already known that the river was dangerous. It was hardly a secret that a fast-flowing, mana-rich river with a lot of third-order beasts might not be a location for a casual dip. But, standing at the edge, close enough for the occasional burst of water washing my feet, I could feel something different. </p><p>Bloodlust. I could feel the centuries of endless fighting had left its mark, radiating a suffocating threat despite its faint nature. I wondered why I hadn’t felt it before. Maybe it was the fact that I had just killed. Or maybe, it was a side effect of my botched meditation. </p><p>An interesting phenomenon. The kind of thing I wished to see once I got free from my uncle's shadow to travel the world. </p><p>Too bad I had other pressing concerns. Astrid opened her eyes once again when she realized we stopped moving. “Is your base on our side —” she started, then looked at the river, and noticed there was no crossing in sight. “What are we doing here?” </p><p>“We’re going to make sure your pursuers can’t catch up with us,” I said. </p><p>She looked at me like I had just promised to extinguish the sun. “How, by killing ourselves?” she said. </p><p>“Not particularly,” I said even as I took a few steps back, and let her sit on a rock. I could explain my situation, but instead, I decided to show by jumping into the river. She cried in shock, blanching as she thought that I had just killed myself. </p><p>Only to stop when I appeared on the surface again, easily floating on the turbulent and fast-flowing water with a few easy strokes, my legs doing the lion’s share of the work. </p><p>Astrid looked at me in shock as she realized the extent of my strength. “What kind of shaper are you, able to show such strength with such a minimal transformation?” she asked even as I pulled myself back to the surface. </p><p>“It’s complicated, hence the reason I need the help of a priestess,” I said. “A favor for a favor. Simple as that.” </p><p>She didn’t look convinced, but her situation was desperate enough to ignore her reasonable doubts. “Aright. What’s the plan?” </p><p>“The immediate part is simple. You’re going to do your best to hold onto my back as I swim upstream until we’re unlucky enough to deal with a third-order beast in the water. We’re going to pull out, circle around, and do our best to leave no trail as we return to the campsite. Then, we’ll move away from the river, and find a safe location.” </p><p>“We need to stop at one point. I’m completely drained of mana.” </p><p>“That, you can do at the camp,” I said. The camp didn’t have the densest concentration of mana, but considering neither Lillian nor I bothered to siphon any, it should be enough to keep her going for a while. </p><p>As for the secret of my mana generation … it would continue to stay a secret. I wasn’t wholly comfortable even with Lillian knowing about it, and our fates were tied together. </p><p>“Alright,” she said, not resisting the plan. She said nothing as I looked around, finding an overgrown ivy. It was an imperfect substitute for a rope, but it was better than nothing. It wouldn’t hold her alone, but it would share the load and make it easier to hold on. “You can’t be serious,” she said. </p><p>“Stand behind me,” I said. She hugged me from behind, and I tied it around our waists as tightly as I could. Without my new strength, it would have been a death sentence, but with it, it should be manageable. “Don’t forget to warn me if you can’t hold on. I don’t trust the ivy to hold on for long.” </p><p>The moment she confirmed it, I threw my spear to the other side of the river, which was only possible with my strength. I hoped that it would be another evidence of our passage, still stained with the blood of her pursuers. A good use, since I couldn’t carry it with me while swimming. </p><p>Even with my strength, swimming upstream in a raging river while carrying a deadweight was not fun, though the balance had been a bigger issue than the power. “Hold your breath,” I ordered as we dove down. It was easier to swim without the turbulence of the surface. And, as an added benefit, it protected us from accidental observers. </p><p>I had to adjust our direction several times, sometimes getting away from the shore to avoid the beasts concealed along the riverbank, looking for easy prey, and sometimes getting closer to the mud to dodge the carnivorous fish. </p><p>Deep in the water, the sense of bloodlust was even stronger. Immersed in the water completely, I could develop a better understanding of it. It wasn’t a sharp, directed sense of murder, more like the imprints of untold number of deaths that had happened around it. Wars, raids, slaves trying to escape, hunting accidents… All washed away by the raging streams of the river, but not forgotten. </p><p>I shook my head, forcing myself to focus on the present. </p><p>Even with all the impediments, I was fast enough to travel two miles in less than ten minutes, which was a welcome development, as even with all the benefits, I could feel Astrid’s grip weakening. So, the moment I found a nice, rocky edge that would leave no footprint, I pulled out, and dashed into the forest without wasting a second, still afraid of an accidental observer. </p><p>I didn’t put Astrid down until we were three miles deep, and came across a nice grassy, concealed alcove. She was panting hard, barely able to hold on. She was too exhausted to walk. </p><p>“We will rest here for a minute before we start moving—” I started as I finally loosened the rope, and let her down. However, the moment I turned to face her. I was silenced by how she looked. Luckily, she was too busy trying to catch her breath to notice it.</p><p>The reason for my sudden silence was simple. When I saved Astrid, she had been covered with mud and dirt due to her escape attempt. While she had healed her wounds, the dirt had remained. </p><p>After ten minutes of swimming through raging waters, all that dirt and mud was gone, leaving the job of hiding her body in her clothes, which had turned into scraps during her escape. And, being drenched didn’t make them any more modest. It revealed a lot of her curvy body. </p><p>And, I had to admit, I liked what I was seeing. </p><p>The show started with her hair. I had already seen its color, but after the water washed away the mess, it revealed a bright, almost flaming quality. Even as it stuck to her body, it looked amazing. I found myself wondering how it would look once it was free, flowing with the wind. Her beautiful face, adorned by her bright emerald eye, looked even better, her pouty lips inviting. If she was dressed properly, she could easily pass for a scion of a noble family. </p><p>As she tried to catch her breath, my gaze dipped down even lower, catching more than a glimpse of her curvy body that showed through the gaps of her shirt, multiple tears that she acquired during her long escape revealing a delicious show of pale skin underneath. </p><p>Her waist was thin, but the same didn’t apply to her hips, which showed particularly well with her drenched skirt sticking to her skirt. Her legs were long, and toned enough to make them particularly appealing. The fact that I had spent the last ten minutes with those legs wrapped around my waist was fun. </p><p>I was suddenly hit with the temptation of repeating the same pose, but this time with her hugging men from front rather than behind. Desire rose in me … too intense to be just my own desire. </p><p>My instincts from my transformation were acting up once again. I sighed even as I turned my back, avoiding the unintentional show. I didn’t want to make a move on her, which wasn’t a wise move in the first place considering we didn’t trust each other, no matter how tempting was her beauty. </p><p>Not to mention, I was still afraid of indulging those foreign instincts. So, I walked around while she recovered, and hopefully fixed her clothes as much as it could be done. “Ready to move?” I asked a moment later. </p><p>“As long as you continue to carry me, yes,” she said, her voice resentful. </p><p>I couldn’t help but chuckle. “Oh great priestess, your chariot awaits,” I said as I crouched down in front of her, and she wrapped her hands around my neck once more just like we did minutes ago. </p><p>Unfortunately, with the memory of her beauty, it felt much different. I sighed, and started running… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Once the main fighting force left, following the injured wolf, I approached the meadow even faster, though still making sure to stay concealed. Just because the remaining opposition looked weak didn’t mean I wanted to neglect an ambush. </p><p>A Scipio family teaching. Never give up an advantage unless it was an absolute necessity. A sneak attack might not be glorious, but turning my back to such a beautiful advantage was never a good idea. Even when my heart beat wildly, fury rushing through my veins, begging for me to show my absolute dominance. </p><p>I took a deep breath to suppress them as I arrived at the edge of the meadow, making sure to approach from the upwind so as not to alert the wolves, happy with my new abilities. The lack of emotional stability was annoying, but the ability to sneak into a tamed pack of wolves was an incredible reward. </p><p>However, even as I took the perfect position, I chose to watch as the two of them dismounted their wolves and approached the priestess with their weapon drawn rather than intervening directly, trying to catch the gaze of the priestess without alerting the fighters. </p><p>It was not a risk I took happily, but one important detail forced me. I was going to ask her for help with magic, complicated, dangerous magic where she could damage me seriously by omitting some important details. The last thing I wanted was to kill someone she didn’t want dead, and create a pointless grudge. </p><p>The real challenge was to catch her gaze without alerting the others. Luckily, the warriors were focused on her rather than their surroundings, and didn’t notice me even as I tried to catch her attention. </p><p>While I was trying to catch her attention, I finally managed to get a good look at the priestess. The first thing I noticed was her clothes. Badly damaged, carrying a lot of mud and blood stains, but none of those stains were older than a day. It told the story of an intense chase. </p><p> Underneath, her skin was flawless — at least from what I could see from all that caked blood and mud — revealing that she had either possessed some self-healing ability, or her unfortunate mount had some really interesting abilities. The former was more likely, but the latter was not impossible either. </p><p>She only had a dagger as a weapon, which looked more ceremonial than functional. She had it raised against the approaching warriors, who chuckled in amusement at first. Then, the priestess turned the dagger to herself, pressing it against her throat and delivering what was clearly a threat, which stopped the warriors immediately. </p><p>One advantage of my sharper eyesight, I could read the details of her expression like she was standing next to me. She was determined to kill herself rather than get captured. I decided it was a safe bet that she would find a few murders acceptable for her continued freedom. While it wasn’t certain, nothing in the life was. </p><p>I took another deep breath before I moved forward in a silent yet deadly dash, wielding my new spear. I first focused on the two that were riding wolves. Trying to attack someone mounted from the ground was supposed to be difficult, but not when one could casually jump ten feet vertically. I didn’t even bother stepping on the wolves. Two stabs, one to the back of the neck of the warrior, the other to the wolf. </p><p>The first one was gone. </p><p>Even as I moved, I watched the redhead from the corner of my eye. She froze in shock at my appearance. However, despite her intense shock, she waved her hand, casting a spell. Three lines of mana moved, touching the wolves. </p><p>The wolves looked dazed. </p><p>I could feel that whatever hold she had was much weaker than what she had over her previous ride, a mere string compared to the chains that controlled her. I could sense them weakening in real-time. But, it didn’t matter. </p><p>It gave me the chance to ignore the beasts as I moved between the three remaining warriors, taking them down before they could even realize what happened. It helped that the two who were close to her decided to take her down first rather than turning toward me. After dealing with the last mounted warrior, I dashed toward them, my speed allowing me to catch them at the back. </p><p>She pointed to the wolves and said something. “Sorry, lady, but I don’t understand you. Any chance you can speak Latin.” </p><p>“Y-you’re a Roman,” she gasped. Her speech was accented, yet clear, showing some proficiency. However, her hatred was clear. </p><p>“Britannian, actually,” I corrected, which was truth only in the most technical sense. But considering the tense situation, I wasn’t willing to explain her situation in any more detail. “But first, what do you want me to do with the wolves.” </p><p>She looked at me suspiciously, but still spoke. “Kill them. They are about to get free.” </p><p>I nodded before I turned my attention to them, bequeathing death to them. Three quick stabs later, we were the only ones still alive. “Now, let’s get out of here,” I said as I walked toward her. </p><p>“And you think I’ll come with you,” she said, which I could see more of a probing question than rejection. Good, she was smart enough to realize that the worst thing I could do was to turn back and leave her to her freedom. She was already swaying in exhaustion, tethering on the edge of collapse. There was only so much distance she could cover on foot in her condition, and covering her tracks against her fellow tribals was pretty much impossible. </p><p>“We both know that it’s your only option,” I said. “Luckily for you, I need the help of someone competent in shapeshifting to help me, so you actually have something to trade,” I said as I showed the scales on my arm. </p><p>It was a bit more direct than I preferred, but showing her that I actually needed her help was the best way to make her trust my intention. It showed her that, even if she came with me, she had some leverage. It gave her another reason to follow a mysterious man deeper into the forest, along with her desperation. </p><p>“You’re a changer,” she said. She looked like she wanted to speak more, but instead, she swayed badly. She had pushed herself to the limit during her escape, and now that the threat was gone, her body was extracting the price. </p><p>I covered the distance between us with one large step, and caught her before falling. Of course, even as I helped her to stand, I kept my focus on her to make sure it wasn’t a trap — more on her magic than her ugly ceremonial dagger. </p><p>It was not a trap. She just collapsed in my arms, barely holding on. I lifted her in a bridal hold, and started running. “Where are we going,” she said. </p><p>“To my camp,” I said, but I moved in the opposite direction, directly to the Rhine, running as fast as I could in the forest. I wanted to lay a false trail to them, and what better distraction than to make them think that, once I had saved the priestess, I went back to the other side. </p><p>She asked nothing about the camp or the occasional changes of direction. She just closed her eyes, trying her best to recover. However, a minute later, she opened her eyes. “Maybe you should pace yourself,” she suggested. </p><p>“Don’t worry about it. My stamina is not that bad,” I replied even as I continued to run, nowhere near my limit. I didn’t push myself to the limit, as I still wanted to pay attention to my surroundings. The last thing I wanted was to stumble upon a beast's nest. </p><p>Or worse, a team of patrolling legionnaires. </p><p>However, while I didn’t want to stumble on such a disaster, I still skirted close to a couple beast colonies I had detected on the way, hoping that they would react badly to a team of wolf riders. A fight would have been preferable, but I would settle for the beasts retreating in panic. The chaos of their movement should be enough to cover up my tracks further.</p><p>“By the way, I still don’t know your name,” I commented as I ran through the forest with the ease of a wild animal. </p><p>She opened her eyes, giving me a frustrated glare, but that didn’t prevent her from speaking. “Astrid,” she said. </p><p>“And I’m Marcus,” I said. </p><p>“No last name. I thought Romans loved those,” she said. </p><p>“Not all Romans,” I said, which was another deflection. She looked curious. Luckily, she was too exhausted to confront me about it. I didn’t want to lie to her about it — for practical reasons, as any lie would destroy the minimal trust she had in me — but also I didn’t want to give her my last name. </p><p>Even in exile, the Scipio Family was famous. Or, from the perspective of the enemies of Rome, infamous. While the greatest achievements of our family had happened in the south, particularly in Hispania and North Africa, that didn’t mean a lack of presence on other borders. A history of blood and glory … until, of course, they decided to back the wrong horse one too many times during the civil wars. </p><p>Then, we arrived at the riverside, where there was no one on either side. For good reason. There was no passage nearby, and the Rhine raged wildly, threatening to drown any that dared to step in. </p><p>However, I was confident in my newly acquired strength. I just needed to convince my unwitting companion that a quick dip into one of the most dangerous rivers of the whole continent was a good idea. </p>",

    "content": "<p>She floated in front of me like a blue specter of death, hard to read. Hard, but not impossible. “Let me tell you how’s this going to go,” she started, her voice even more threatening with her power giving it a weird echo. “You’re going to give me every recording you have, erase all the backups you have, and in exchange, I’m not going to crush you to a fine paste.” </p><p>A complete bluff. While she was shocked, she wasn’t shocked enough to commit murder. So, rather than begging like she expected, I just smirked. “Is the voice a side effect, or something you do deliberately?” I asked. </p><p>She stilled, shocked by my question. “Are you mocking me!” </p><p>“No, genuinely curious,” I said, which was true, but not the real objective. The real objective was to take over the conversation rather than bargaining based on her threats. “But either way, keep it up if you want to throw a tantrum and make pointless threats rather than talking as adults. There’s no way I’ll erase those recordings, especially not now.” </p><p>“What, so that you can blackmail me!” she said. </p><p>I smiled gently. “Of course not. I’m not an idiot, blackmailing someone stronger than me.’ </p><p>She stilled. “But you just told me that you’re not going to erase them.” </p><p>“Yes, but did I tell you that I’m going to use it to make you do anything. They will stay, but only to make sure you don’t demolish my bar. You do have a reputation, after all,” I said. </p><p>It was amusing to see her power actually flicker as she dipped her head in shame. It seemed that she was sensitive about her identity as the Lady of Destruction.</p><p>She floated above me for a few seconds, examining me. “You’re not afraid,” she commented. </p><p>“Should I be?” I said. </p><p>“Of course. I’m one of the strongest supers, ever.” </p><p>I chuckled. “Irrelevant,” I said. She tensed, giving signs of actual anger. Clearly, she was sensitive about her identity. “Sweetie, I’m a normal man. It doesn’t matter how strong a super is. Even the weakest one could easily deal with me. Hell, even if you had been normal, you could have smashed my head with a paperweight while I was lost in your beautiful pussy. Mortal danger is hardly a new thing for me. You could have killed me then, and you could kill me now. Style points hardly matter.” </p><p>I was distorting the facts a bit, of course, but, it still gave me enough reason to actually ignore the threat she posed. She said nothing. </p><p>“Now, why don’t you sit here, and we can talk about it as adults,” I said as I patted the desk. “Feel free to keep the force field active if you’re afraid of poor old me, of course.”</p><p>Removing the force field had nothing to do with her actual safety, as I had read the reports showing that sneak attacks didn’t work on her. However, she didn’t know that I knew, which made it a challenge to her pride. </p><p>So, rather than dignifying it with an answer, she floated down and sat on the desk. The glow faded off everywhere but her eyes. Unfortunately for her, while removing the glow did nothing to weaken her physical defenses, psychological defenses were a different matter.</p><p>It was hard to ignore the fact that she was naked. She crossed her legs to hide her core, and her arms crossed on her chest, reducing the show. Which, ironically, was even sexier than if she owned her nudity, and more vulnerable as well. </p><p>“Speak.” </p><p>“Let’s continue where we left off. You were about to tell me how many cameras you require, and I was going to tell you how many nights you have to be under me to pay it off.” </p><p>The glow in her eyes intensified. “And, where’s your promise not to blackmail me,” she said. </p><p>I laughed. “Where’s the blackmail. I had already offered you that deal when I didn’t know your identity, and I’m just offering you to continue using the same deal.” </p><p>“And if I don’t accept,” she said, trying to sound in control, but she had long lost control of the discussion. Her belligerent attitude was a way to get back control. Unfortunately for her, I had no intention of letting her succeed. </p><p>“Well, then you can leave,” I said with a shrug. </p><p>“And, how would I know you won’t release … my identity, regardless.”</p><p>I chuckled. “How would I know that you won’t destroy my bar if you feel like it, Miss Blue Princess,” I said, deliberately condescending using her name. “For once, you’re going to just live with the uncertainty like the rest of us mortals.”</p><p>She hissed in anger, yet said nothing, unable to keep up with the discussion, only the glow of her eyes showing that it was not just a lovers’ quarrel based on the way we were dressed. </p><p>I waited for half a minute, letting the silence stretch while she tried to process the situation, before I spoke again. After all, while I wanted her to calm down slightly, I didn’t want her to be completely used to the situation. “Now, it’s your lucky day, because we have a common enemy,” I said. </p><p>“The Syndicate,” she said. </p><p>“Yes, we both want to take them down because of their weapon trade,” I said, deliberately misreading her mission. I knew that they wanted to save the tech expert, but taking down the Syndicate overlapped with it enough to give us a chance to collaborate.</p><p>“And who do you work for,” she said. </p><p>“Whoever pays me,” I said with a shrug. “I’m a mercenary, and I have a mystery client who’s annoyed with all the weapons that the Syndicate is transporting to their territory,” I said. </p><p>“And why are you telling me that,” she said. </p><p>I gave her a deadpan gaze. “You’re a first-tier hero. There’s no way you’re gallivanting in bars because you want to take down a bunch of drug dealers. You’re here, because you know it’s a cover. Not even a good one.” </p><p>She had no choice but to nod. “True, but doesn’t that mean you want to collaborate with me,” she said. “I can offer you much more than … what I had been previously doing. Maybe I can pay you as well.” </p><p>“Sure, if you’re willing to pay me thirty million, with several bonus clauses if I could discover who’s behind them,” I said, throwing a random number that stole her breath. Her gasp was beautiful. “Being a mercenary pays well … not this well usually, of course, but this is a special mission. The Syndicate annoyed a lot of people with their move.” </p><p>“That’s a lot of money —” she muttered, then froze. “Wait, who’s behind them?” </p><p>“Yeah. The Syndicate is not big enough for the national stage. They have supporters. We just don’t know who,” I started, acting like I didn’t notice her shock even as I gave her a pretty big piece of information. At the same time, it showed her that she actually needed me to handle her mission successfully. </p><p>It was good to show her that she could still get the upper hand. </p><p>“We can still collaborate,” she said. </p><p>“It’s difficult,” I said. “My reputation as a mercenary would be gone if it’s known I work with heroes …” Then, I smirked. “At least openly. But, people couldn’t blame me for getting a new girlfriend, could they? And, if my girl browses my cameras while I’m distracted, there’s nothing I can do.” </p><p>“That’s absurd,” she said. </p><p>“Really, it works to your benefit as well,” I offered. “Or, would you prefer to tell your superiors that you were careless enough to reveal your identity and failed your mission,” I suggested. I wasn’t able to tap into their communication a lot, but from what I read, she wanted to impress her mentor quite a bit. Then, I put my hand on her leg, caressing her again. “And, it’s not like playing my girlfriend is something you hate, right … Amelia. We still didn’t have our bike trip, after all.” </p><p>She blushed as my hand climbed up suggestively. With the fear of a near-disaster gone, her adrenaline was coming down. And, such a shift was perfect for rekindling arousal. </p><p>“I don’t know…” she muttered, but I could see that she was already coming around to the idea. </p><p>“Think about it,” I whispered, offering my Faustian bargain. She shivered. The glow in her eyes faded, showing her acceptance. “You will accomplish your mission and earn the admiration of your allies, and you’ll solve a very dangerous problem in the process. And, in the process, you’ll have a lot of fun…” I added. </p><p>“Maybe…” she whispered. </p><p>“Have you ever been fucked while riding a bike at full speed,” I whispered. “Imagine doing that, while wearing nothing but the skirt we have purchased for you…” Her legs parted open invitingly. </p><p>“I still need to think,” she said as she jumped off the desk. “I need to go.” </p><p>“Sure,” I said even as I typed Tara to bring new clothes for her. She might not know her answer, but I did. She would accept the offer. And, while I could hasten the process, I didn’t want her to realize just how little role she played in that decision. A good sleep should help her deceive herself. </p><p>I grabbed her waist and walked out with her. “You know where to find me…” </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Y-you’re going to give me the records,” she whispered even as she was pulled up to her feet. </p><p>“Of course. Let me help you to the office while my beautiful bouncer puts everything back in order,” I said, gesturing for her to clean the mess before reopening the bar. </p><p>Daria smiled smiled. It was a weak smile. Not because she was feeling stressed, but because her face was still feeling slack with pleasure. “No need to help. I can walk —” she started, only to be interrupted by a moan, which might or might not be about the way I chose to help her walk. </p><p>Standing right behind her, pushing my hips forward to sheathe my cock into her core aggressively to make her wetness devour my girth, it was certainly a unique method. “No, I insist,” I said even as my hands settled on her hips. “Now, walk.” </p><p>“Y-you’re so kind,” she sassed, or, at least, she tried to sass, but her moans prevented her from being successful. I chuckled in amusement even as I started ramming her hard, making it even more challenging for her to take a step forward. Her legs trembled badly as I invaded her hard, but she still took a step forward despite her trembling legs. </p><p>“It’s my pleasure,” I replied, not bothering to conceal my chuckle even as I slapped her ass, using her roughly. She tried to keep her moans down, but failed. “My pleasure indeed.” </p><p>A few steps later, her legs almost gave under her. And, I pulled out just as she was collapsing. She turned back until she was facing me, looking at me angrily while I smirked. “Well, you said you don’t need any help,” I started mockingly. “But, if you need it, you can always beg for me.</p><p>The flash of anger on her face was beautiful, especially since it was accompanied by arousal. Playing with one of the greatest heroes ever was certainly entertaining. “Right,” she murmured. “May you help me walk to your office, sir?” she said. </p><p>“My pleasure,” I said even as I grabbed her ass, and slid inside her again, this time facing her. </p><p>“I — I can’t walk like this,” she muttered. </p><p>“You only complain,” I teased her. “But this time, you’re onto something,” I added as I lifted her. “Wrap your legs around my waist. I’ll carry you,” I added like I was doing a great favor. </p><p>“You’re so kind,” she replied, though, between her moans, only my power allowed me to catch the intended sarcasm. I chuckled, though it came more as a grunt as her legs tightened around me, taking me even deeper than I had been intending. </p><p>It felt spectacular. </p><p>I said nothing else as I buried my fingers in her hips hard, ramming her violently. Her hips swayed in response, rocking as hard as she could manage as I walked toward my office. Halfway in, I caught her gaze again. “Break time,” I said even as I pinned her against the wall, fucking her even harder. </p><p>Her lack of protest was noticeable. </p><p>I continued caressing her naked body until she was near another climax but didn’t let her succeed. Instead, I started walking once more, and even stopped invading her repeatedly, letting my cock stay in her. At the edge of a climax, she had no choice but to take over. Her hips rose before landing back, taking me fully. </p><p>The sudden, desperate mewling that exploded from her instead of a frustrated growl showed the effectiveness of the move. I continued walking as she did her best to bring herself to completion. </p><p>Too bad I was cheating. </p><p>Just like my power could be used to move her to the climax faster, it could also slow her down. Or ruin her completely, but it wasn’t the point. A brush here, a sharp touch there, and she stayed at the edge, getting more and more desperate as she tried to push herself to the climax, but she was yet to succeed when we sat on my chair. </p><p>“Why don’t you check the security feed and see how much of the recording you need,” I said even as I grabbed her ass, preventing her from moving. </p><p>“R-right now?” she stammered, her eyes widening as she caught my expression, and realized I deliberately stopped her before she reached her climax. </p><p>“No time like the present. I’m a busy man,” I said even as I grabbed and lifted her, only to put her down again after helping her turn the other way, looking at the screen. </p><p>A screen that was currently showing the office, where she was being fucked. Her eyes widened even as she raised her hips, preparing to go down again. At that moment, I grabbed her hips and pushed her down. Already at the edge, it proved her to push over the edge. </p><p>I joined her, filling her core with my seed. She just moaned in shock. “Think of it as an advance payment,” I said before I caressed her cheek. She leaned against my chest, breathing hard. “Now, let’s talk about the actual payment.” </p><p>“You want me … in exchange for the camera recordings. I thought we agreed to it.”</p><p>“Yes, but the question is how many cameras you want,” I said. “And, which historical records do you want,” I said. “I have many cameras,” I said as I started flipping through them. The old set only, and not the set Emily had installed. </p><p>She tensed when I stopped the camera at a random alley. I smirked, not expecting her to recognize it. It was the alley where I caught her transforming into her alter ego. </p><p>As she lay against my chest, breathing hard in growing panic, I slowly started to consider a daring move. I might have not considered it if it wasn’t for the earlier attack from the mob, showing the Syndicate’s intention to escalate. That, and my earlier snooping, showed that neither she nor her allies were interested in busting a small-time villain, their objective far more grand. </p><p>It was an excellent opportunity. I could have shown the recording of her transforming to Blue Princess immediately, but instead, I moved my hands to her breasts, and caressed them. That reveal needed to be handled delicately. </p><p>“Why did you tense suddenly,” I said. “Don’t tell me you have done something embarrassing there,” I added even as I squeezed her nipples. My words made her relax slightly. </p><p>“Nothing much, it just looks disgusting,” she said, trying to find an excuse. It wasn’t a particularly good excuse, once again showing her limits as an agent of infiltration, and limits of her small team. </p><p>“Oh, really,” I said even as I squeezed her nipples, ready to take the opportunity to confront her about her real identity, which was much better than just revealing that I had known it all along. </p><p>One of my hands stayed on her breasts, alternating between her glorious mounds, while the other slid down between her naked legs once more, teasing her knob, her moans enough to make my cock come back to life. “I wonder exactly what I would find there if I bring the recording back,” I said. </p><p>She tensed more. “Don’t think about destroying anything,” I said. “All of my security records are backed up in several offshore servers, and while no one can access it as long as the computer stays intact, it changes if the bar gets destroyed. I don’t know if the destruction of the computer would trigger it. I don’t want whatever embarrassing secret you have to fall in the hands of my business partners,” I said, immediately spinning a reasonable excuse that would prevent her from relying on brute force. </p><p>She froze, not even reacting to my cock. It would not do. I twisted her nipples even harder even as I grabbed her hair, pulling her head back hard to kiss her hard. She was completely under my control, this time in more ways than one. Unfortunately, my power helped me to read immediately that she didn’t enjoy it. </p><p>A fake loss of control was quite different than a real one, it seemed.</p><p>So, even as I pulled back, I quickly played back the recording under her horrified glance. “Stop it. I warn you,” she said, her voice sharp and intimidating. “You’ll be sorry!” </p><p>I had to admit, I would have believed it if it wasn’t for my power. Even without her power on display, she could be intimidating, and that was with her still naked, freshly fucked, and with my cock still inside her. </p><p>Her identity as a world-class hero was not for nothing. </p><p>Unfortunately for her, my identity as a cocky villain was a good excuse to ignore her sudden change of attitude. Under her horrified glare, the screen showed the aftermath of her last visit, where she flew away using her powers. </p><p>At the same time, I typed a message to Tara, telling her not to burst in no matter what she heard unless I gave her a signal. The situation was too delicate for her to help. </p><p>“Wow, that’s a twist I wasn’t expecting,” I lied. </p><p>She growled in anger even as a blue glow covered her, and she floated in front of my desk, turning to face me. Unfortunately, her power hid her body away. A great disappointment. </p><p>Now, not only do I need to pacify a panicking heroine, but also miss a show while doing so. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“So, that was one of the more interesting first interviews I had,” I said with a chuckle even as I sat next to Amy, enjoying her confused her expression. She clearly didn’t appreciate me sitting next to her, but even as she spat her makeshift gag — her roommate’s underwear — she didn’t complain about it. </p><p>It was a bit difficult considering we had just a threesome. There had been no direct contact between use, but Carol had been a bridge. </p><p>As far as icebreakers went, calling it effective was underselling it. </p><p>“Not the craziest?” she asked, choosing to take the out I granted her rather than talking about the elephant in the room. </p><p>“I’m a fashion photographer. So, believe me when I say it was not,” I said with a chuckle, enjoying her silence as she checked my body. I was happy see that, now that she was not distracted by the presence of her roommate — and secret love — she was looking my body with appreciation. </p><p>“Good, now untie me,” she said as she turned slightly, presenting me her tied arms. I touched the belt, but rather than untying her immediately, I let my finger drag along, enjoying her slight shiver. “What are you waiting for?” she growled, clearly frustrated by her own physical response. </p><p>“Well, I can … or I can leave it for Carol to unwrap. Which one you prefer?” </p><p>“Why would I prefer the second one?” she declared, her tone abrasive, like her body didn’t shiver far more intensely at the idea. </p><p>I thought about challenging her about her intense crush, but after a momentary consideration, I changed my mind. “Well, I thought you might be interested in pranking your roomie. Imagine how she would react when she leaves the shower, only to see you being fucked in her own bed, your hands still bound,” I said. </p><p>As far as pranks went, it wasn’t a particularly creative one … and that was assuming it could be classified as prank in the first place. </p><p>Her thoughtful expression showed that she cared about the prank factor even less. Instead, she was clearly more interested in another threesome opportunity, this time with something more than just licking.  </p><p>“It would be fun to see her face,” she said. </p><p>“Good,” I said as I grabbed her arm and forced her up, not enough to be truly painful, but enough to be intensely annoying. “Feel free to tell if you can’t handle a little pain,” I challenged her. </p><p>And received a scathing angry gaze that might have actually scared me if it wasn’t for her bound arms. Yet, she was just in the mood, and clearly took that as a challenge, not complaining the slightest as I yanked her arm as I pushed her toward Carol’s bedroom. </p><p>Her challenging silence continued as I pushed her on Carol’s bed face first, her naked ass pointing upward. She was tense as I dragged my finger against her entrance, but also expectant. </p><p>Clearly, her love of Carol didn’t exclude her from having a little bit of fun. </p><p>She finally let a gasp once I grabbed her hair, pulling just enough to hurt rather than slipping inside. Instead, I lay next to her, and my fingers started dancing at her entrance. </p><p>“Why the delay,” she challenged. “Don’t tell me you’re not hard yet. We might need to think about this threesome idea if that’s the case,” she declared, her tone abrasive as she challenged my male pride. </p><p>If I was any less confident about it, I might have tried to prove just how wrong she was. Instead, I chuckled as I continued teasing her. “Don’t tell me you think I can be manipulated that easily,” I commented with a chuckle. “You can always beg for it.” </p><p>“Only in your dreams —” she started, only to let out a gasp once my fingers twisted, triggering a jolt of pleasure. She looked surprised, not expecting me to play with her body with such an ease. </p><p>“It sounds like a challenge,” I said. “Do you want to bet?” </p><p>“What’s the bet?” she asked. </p><p>“That I can either make you beg for it, or make you cum, before Carol gets out of the shower,” I challenged. “And if I win, I want this…” I said, dragging my finger along her puckered hole. She tensed in a way that suggested she had never done it before, but despite her panic, she didn’t say anything about it. </p><p>Instead, she followed with her challenge. “And, if I win, I will tie you and we’ll tease you for the rest of the night,” she countered. </p><p>I had to admit. She played it well. If she won, she would have what she truly wanted, but with an excuse that prevented her from admitting any kind of emotional vulnerability, which she clearly cared more than her anal virginity. </p><p>“Good. Don’t worry. When I win, I will make sure to let you prepare it properly,” I said even as I continued to tease her entrance. I could see that affected by it, but she still accepted it with determination. When I sneaked nearer to kiss her neck, she reacted better, no doubt not expecting a gentle approach, but it was her mistake. </p><p>Bondage and edge play didn’t mean sadism. Unfortunately, I didn’t have hours to properly drive her mad, not with Carol still in the shower. I expected her to stay there for a long time, using it an excuse not to confront her roommate, but even then, it would be measured in minutes, not hours. </p><p>So, I cheated. “I just need to decide one thing about our appointment,” I whispered into her ear. </p><p>“And, what’s that important question?” she asked. </p><p>“Whether to ask Carol to join in,” I whispered. “It might be interesting to double the fun,” I whispered. “I couldn’t help but imagine how beautiful her expression would be as I pushed my cock through her puckered hole. Do you think she’ll cry or moan?” </p><p>“T-talking about another girl when you’re busy with me. T-that’s rude,” she said, which might have been effective if it wasn’t for the way her voice trembling. </p><p>“Don’t tell me you’re jealous of your precious roommate,” I whispered. “You didn’t seem to care while she had been licking you in the living room, every brush of her tongue making you shiver more and more…” </p><p>Amy whimpered as I continued to talk about Carol while I fingered her, her wetness getting thicker and thicker. She clearly didn’t expect that from me, and she wasn’t handling it very well. </p><p>Even that was an understatement, I realized barely a minute later, when her body started rocking, and she desperately bit her pillow to keep her voice down. She must have spent a lot of sleepless night dreaming of Carol if that was her reaction after a minute of teasing. </p><p>“Well, that was easier than I expected,” I said with a chuckle as I moved back. </p><p>“I … I didn’t cum,” she said, which I didn’t even deign with an answer, not with her body rocking desperately with the aftershocks. </p><p>Instead, I moved behind her. Not for my rightfully gained reward … no, that was for later. For now, I wanted to properly enjoy everything she was giving for me. I pressed my shaft against her entrance. Her only reaction was to raise her hips up slightly, showing just how desperate she was for someone to douse her arousal. </p><p>She moaned as I impaled her aggressively, once again biting the pillow to keep her voice down, but failed. I tightened my grip on her hands — still bound behind her — as I picked up speed, finally fucking her properly after all the teasing. Soon, even the pillow stopped containing her desperate cries, howling and gasping in equal measures. </p><p>At the background, I heard the sound of the shower stop, and rapid footsteps approaching. A second later, Carol appeared at the doorway, her expression panicked as she took a note of what was going on … which turned into exasperation. </p><p>“Try not to moan that much, baby. It’s not a competition,” Carol complained, announcing her presence, unaware of the impact it had on Amy. Amy tensed around my girth as she realized she was being watched, trying to bite the pillow even more desperately.</p><p>I didn’t let her. I grabbed her bright pink hair, using the handle to raise her head up, her cries filling the room, Carol’s presence not helping her to contain herself.  </p><p>Carol chuckled, though I could see that it was more about suppressing her confusion. “I’ll go and dry. Try to finish quickly,” she commented. </p><p>“Nonsense, come sit,” I said, disagreeing with her, but I didn’t stop my main work even for a moment. </p><p>“I don’t want to ruin the bed,” she answered, but I interrupted her with a chuckle. </p><p>“I think it’s a bit late for it,” I said as I pointed at the sheets, already ruined with Amy’s earlier explosion. “Just come here and enjoy the show.” </p><p>“Well…” Carol said, conflicted, but she was unable to resist under my gaze. She was not the only girl in the room that couldn’t let a challenge go unanswered…</p>",

    "content": "<p>I watched as the other cultivators retreated with fear on their faces. I understood the reason for it, as the pressure from two Golden Core cultivators was enough to physically change the landscape even as they floated in the sky. </p><p>I didn’t retreat, staying safely behind the safety of the defensive formation I had created, confident for my safety as long as I avoided a direct confrontation. I needed to watch them, because I wanted to be ready to destroy the ruins the moment they tried to push forward. I didn’t trust my defenses to hold back Golden Core elders, and while I had set up some automated defenses, I didn’t want to rely on them. </p><p>However, it wasn’t the biggest reason. No, I wanted to see the prowess of Golden Core, to understand just how far behind I was of them. It would affect my future significantly. </p><p>Still, I couldn’t help but curse Pearyin’s mystery disappearance. The only reason I took such a risk was her disappearance. I couldn’t run away and leave her, so I needed to understand the limits of true power. </p><p>The old woman of Entsa Pavilion raised her hand for a palm attack, and a suffocating wave of Qi hit against my formation, even the aftereffects enough to make the defenses creak. Through formation, I could feel that the Qi she used was different. It was denser, almost liquified. </p><p>At the same time, a palm imprint that was as big as a house appeared in the air, and flew toward the other old man. </p><p>I was glad for the existence of my formation, as I watched the palm attack, I found myself mesmerized, as if I was a teenager and saw an incredible view at the party. I wasn’t able to pull my eyes away from the movement of the mystical energy cutting through the air. </p><p>It was far more spectacular and complicated than anything I could come up with. </p><p>I could have watched for hours. However, before I could get more than a glimpse, the old man replicated a similar action with a punch, which neutralized the palm attack, which only threw him a few steps back. </p><p>“Do you really want to fight against Kartpa Valley about this? Wouldn’t it be better for you to deal with your problems instead? It would be a pity if your precious Pavilion gets destroyed while you’re busy outside.” </p><p>“Our great sect is not weak enough that the absence of an outer sect elder would make a difference,” she answered, but she didn’t follow up with an attack, her gaze turning toward the ruins that had been creaking at the aftermath of their attacks. </p><p>They looked at each other silently, in a tense standoff. “Usual rules, then,” the old woman sighed. “The ruins are clearly for Qi cultivators. We will let the younger generation fight for it,” she declared. </p><p>“Agreed,” the old man answered, and both of them waved their hands, and two layers of pure Qi appeared around the ruins, sealing it temporarily. It was not as strong as their previous attacks, so I believed that it was more of a warning than actually keeping people out. However, it would probably still keep any ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivator away. </p><p>It would have kept me away as well, but my formations already gave me a secret tunnel I could use. </p><p>I stayed in my hiding spot for an hour even after they disappeared, making sure everything had gone perfectly. Luckily for me, the elders that had visited didn’t seem like formation experts, allowing me to pull my bluff better than I expected. </p><p>Of course, it was clear that the move had only made things more complicated in the longer term, when the real experts arrived, but at this point, I was happy to distract them for a few days. </p><p>And, if it came to worst, I could always trigger the destruction of the ruins when an expert started poking, making it look like it was their mistake that the ruins had been destroyed. </p><p>On my way back, my first stop was Markas, checking to see if there was anyone who had discovered what had been going on. Seeing that it was safe, I reinforced the formations around the valley to a significant degree. </p><p>Then, considering the danger that was going on, I created another medicinal garden and started flooding it with excess Qi from the spiritual vein, focusing on growing plants that could provide essence for martial artists. </p><p>It wasn’t immediately needed, but with everything going on, I wanted to be ready to create Connate Realm martial artists en masse. </p><p>However, I wasn’t able to expand it as much as I had wished, because,, merely an hour after I had started, I felt a strong Qi presence entering the border of Zaim, flying toward the capital. Whatever it was, it wasn’t just a flying cultivator, radiating too much Qi for it to be the case. It didn’t take long for me to realize that its destination was capital. </p><p>Whatever it was, it moved far faster than me, forcing me to race toward the capital with all my might. Luckily, whatever it was, it slowed down halfway, allowing me to reach the capital with some advantage of time. </p><p>Once I arrived at the capital, I felt myself relax. With the spiritual vein giving me a lot of Qi I could leverage, I was confident to deal with anything below Golden Core, and even against them, I could probably get away with it. </p><p>I thought about alerting Aisnam, but she was still in her throne room. While I could contact her, there was limited benefit to talking with her. Instead, I went toward the hidden training room, where her army of female warriors had been training. </p><p>I paused just for a second to change my looks into an old man before I appeared. “Gather around. It’s time for treatment,” I called, and even as I said so. Knowing the structure, they lined up one by one, and I started feeding them essence pills while applying acupuncture, allowing them to break into the Connate realm,, using all my pill reserves in the process. </p><p>While I didn’t know what was about to happen, there was no harm in preparing myself for the worst. And, giving Aisnam a stronger army seemed like a reasonable precaution. </p><p>While I worked on what was going on, the Qi presence stopped somewhere near the edge of the territory of the capital. Even though I was yet to finish empowering the army, I left for a while and rushed out, wanting to what was the object I could feel through my detection formation. </p><p>A mad dash later, I was looking at a … flying ship. It looked like an ordinary seafaring ship but without the sails, and it was quite large, easily a hundred feet from one end to another. Its ability to fly was not shocking, considering it was leaking Qi. An expensive tool to run. </p><p>I heard a few cultivators mentioning the existence of flying ships that stronger and richer cultivators used, though I didn’t expect to see one, as they were supposed to be out of the reach of even the smaller cultivator families, let alone the itinerant ones. </p><p>Though, it was hard to argue its usefulness. </p><p>While the flying ship was fascinating, two other details caught my gaze. The first one obvious. A small army was currently disembarking the ship. They were dressed ordinarily, but my gaze was too sharp to miss the fact that they were Tiger Fist experts. It looked like they decided to add some reinforcements, which, ultimately wasn’t too surprising after the most recent development. </p><p>What truly surprised me was the flags that were on the flying ship, declaring its ownership. There were two distinct symbols. One of them belonged to Kartpa Valley, which was not a surprise. The real surprise was the other flag. </p><p>Verdant Family. </p><p>I was tempted to intervene directly, but I didn’t dare to. I wasn’t scared of the flying ship. At this point, I had too many tricks to be leveraged against such a threat. </p><p>What scared me was the flag of the Kartpa Valley, making me fear the potential consequences if I touched the ship. Things were getting too complicated. </p>",

    "content": "<p>As I looked at the solitary hill I picked as the location of the mystic land, I started processing what I knew about such places. My knowledge predominantly came from the gossip of the itinerant cultivators during my long stay at the cultivator market. Hardly the most reliable source, but creating a fake target was better than letting the cultivators search desperately until they stumble upon it. </p><p>Based on their gossip, I learned the existence of three common types of mystic lands. </p><p>The first type of the ruins of a sect or a civilization, which, considering the constant warfare that defined the cultivation world, was not surprising. Sometimes, the cultivators die but the physical location of the sect stays hidden. At least until the protective formation slowly erodes due to the passage of time, and finally reveals the remains. </p><p>The second type was the lands of natural treasures, which were more similar to misty mountains, but usually more compact. I knew even less about it, but apparently, some natural treasures were strong enough to distort their surroundings enough to turn themselves into mystic lands. </p><p>However, what I planned to build was the third one. </p><p>A land of inheritance. </p><p>The one thing that the cultivators were obsessed about was the concept of inheritance. They valued their disciples, and apparently, some of the cultivators went as far as building some treasure lands that could teach their techniques to future generations. </p><p>I chose that, for one important reason. It was an accepted fact that any such land of inheritance could have strict rules. Forbidding the access of cultivators stronger than a certain level, going as far as adding explosions, was common. </p><p>That fact was my biggest reliance.</p><p>I started by building an outer layer of formation, with three different functions. It would allow the passage of the Qi Gathering cultivators. It would block the approach of the Foundation Establishment cultivators, and if they insist on approaching, actually attack them. </p><p>And, if a Golden Core cultivator tried to enter, it would start self-destructing. I added that, because I didn’t trust myself to deal with a cultivator of that level, even with effectively endless Qi under my control. </p><p>By limiting access to Qi Gathering cultivators, I hoped to limit the value of the mystic land, which was a tightrope to walk. It should be valuable enough to explain the region-wide palm technique inspiration, but not to the point of drawing the real heavy hitters. And, if I could make sure the cultivators would stick around a few months while I reinforced the formations around the spiritual vein to keep even a Golden Core cultivator away for a considerable time. </p><p>“Now, to the finishing touch,” I muttered as I reached my inventory, and pulled the Verdant Sword, the Black Medium Grade one. “Fascinating,” I muttered as I examined the weapon, which was only roughly similar to the one Aisnam had given.</p><p>The difference between the two major grades was too much.</p><p>Then, there was testing. </p><p>The original sword had a limited capability. Even a full-powered strike merely consumed a strand of Qi. As a result, it was unable to penetrate the defenses of a cultivator easily. A threat to lower stages, but against a Peak Qi Gathering Cultivator, it was just as useless as a mortal weapon. The Black-ranked sword, on the other hand, was much stronger. It could easily handle hundreds of Qi strands for a hit. </p><p>Then, there was the biggest advantage. It was designed to work with external Qi, making the task of linking it with formation even easier. And, as a Black-ranked artifact, a full-powered strike was enough to threaten a Foundation Building cultivator. </p><p>Well, hopefully. </p><p>Setting the outer layer of the formation took a long time, and once it was complete, I let the entrance I had built out a spike of Qi, alerting cultivators that flew around the region, looking for the source. </p><p>And, as I waited for the others to approach, I started working on the next stage … forging lots and lots of fake evidence. First, I used some old paper to create a lot of calligraphy works, and various words that all focused on the concept of palm. </p><p>And, once all those finished, I added one last touch, a signboard with a name that would be visible the moment someone approached, one that reflected the full range of my understanding of Palm Techniques. </p><p>‘Trial of Endless Palm.’</p><p>Of course, what I was building was not a huge place that would deserve such a fancy name, but a much smaller part. Merely an entrance, with some protective formations and multiple crystal formations where cultivators could ‘prove’ themselves in order to access the further stages. </p><p>Creating one fake room convincingly was much better than trying to build the whole structure. With that room in place, I would have the time to work on the rest of the structure as needed. And, hopefully, that mysterious gate would disappear in a few days, freeing me from the obligation. </p><p>If not … well, I would think that when it happened. </p><p>I was still working on the room when one of the foundation establishment cultivators appeared, floating over the fake ruins. His uniform identified him as a member of one of the cultivation families. He floated down until he reached the range of detection. </p><p>Only for an illusionary palm attack to appear and target him. I had designed that attack based on the Furious Tsunami technique. Even in its raw form, it was strong enough to threaten an unprepared Foundation Establishment cultivator. And, now that it was using the energy of the spiritual vein, it appeared with far more strength. </p><p>The cultivator managed to dodge it barely and retreated. Around him, a Qi shield appeared as he prepared to defend himself against a follow-up attack, but no attack came. </p><p>“Only the prospective students of the Qi Gathering realm can approach!” a voice boomed loudly instead. It was an automatic message I had integrated, informing the intruders about the so-called rules of the place. </p><p>“Is there no room for negotiation, master!” the Foundation Establishment cultivator shouted back. “I am an elder of the Untara family. Maybe we could come to an agreement.” </p><p>However, as he shouted, there was no answer. I only programmed a limited number of responses, and they would only trigger against various acts, and not through communication. </p><p>He shouted for a while and received no response. However, when he tried to intrude, he had been pushed away by another palm attack, threatening to suffocate him. He managed to dodge it and moved closer … only to be confronted by two palm attacks at the same time, which swept him away despite his shield. </p><p>While he was trying to regain his balance, another flying cultivator appeared. “It seems that you are having trouble, my friend.” </p><p>“Elder Yinamta. You’re here as well,” the elder of the Untara family responded, his attitude making it clear that he was not welcome. “Too bad I was here first. According to the deal between our families, it means the ruins belong to me.” </p><p>Yinamta chuckled. “Don’t be ridiculous, old friend. Do you think such a deal has any meaning against what’s clearly such a valuable treasure? This place clearly holds a true treasure to allow people to comprehend palm techniques in such a wide area. It belongs to whoever is stronger. And, you know that I was always the better one when it comes to palm techniques.” </p><p>With that,, Elder Yinamta dived toward the ruins as well. The first palm appeared. He dodged easily. The second wave, he dodged one, and countered one with his own palm attack. </p><p>Giving me my first real glimpse of the Foundation Establishment cultivator. His attack was significantly stronger compared to anything I could do, mostly because of the difference between the Qi. Both Qi gathering and Foundation Establishment cultivators released the same type of Qi. Both types … for the lack of a term, were gaseous, but a much greater density had been gathered into one attack, making it far stronger than a Qi Gathering realm attack. </p><p>Well, an ordinary Qi Gathering realm attack. </p><p>Once he dealt with the second wave of attack, he moved forward, only to meet with four attacks, each four times stronger than the previous attacks. Soon, Elder Yinamta found himself flying back as well. </p><p>“It looks like your vaunted palm skills disappointed you, old friend,” the first cultivator said. “Maybe we should cooperate —” </p><p>That was all he was able to say before a suffocating pressure hit both of them, and they were forcibly floated down. “Leave this place, little cultivators. This place belongs to our sect,” said the cultivator who had just appeared from nothingness, wearing the outfit of the Kartpa Valley. </p><p> “Oh, really,” another voice responded just as another cultivator appeared, not too far away from the Kartpa Valley cultivator. And an old woman, wearing the outfit of the Entsa Pavilion. “I thought this region was under our protection. Since when it belongs to your sect!” </p><p>I watched the show from a distance, too afraid to move. </p><p>I had expected that my ploy would get the attention of the Golden Core cultivators eventually, but it was still a scary realization when it finally happened. </p><p>I wondered if I pushed my luck too much.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The first reaction I had after the discovery of the spiritual vein was to freeze, panicking as I realized I had just touched something that belonged to one of the four strongest sects of the continent. I wanted to run before a dozen Golden Core cultivators came to eviscerate me. Incredible formation skills or not, dealing with hostile Golden Core cultivators was not something I could do. </p><p>But then, my rationality managed to reassert itself. </p><p>The current mortal region didn’t belong to Kartpa Valley but Entsa Pavilion, which was another of the four great forces, meaning Kartpa Valley couldn’t just send their forces to take over the region without starting a war. It probably explained everything that had been happening at Markas, with the rebellion and anything.</p><p>However, one thing didn’t make sense. If Kartpa Valley discovered the area and wanted to take over, why their initial moves were so weak and wishy-washy. Even trying to stay undercover, I didn’t believe that it was the limits Kartpa Valley would go to take over the area. I expected something more intense. </p><p>“The formation is the clue,” I suddenly muttered, realizing one important thing. The formation around the spiritual vein was powerful, but it was more of a raw power than skill. And, I didn’t believe that Kartpa valley not having at least one formation expert. </p><p>It led me to conclude that it wasn’t a ploy of the Kartpa Valley, but one solitary elder. An elder who sealed the vein with his meager formation skills rather than informing his sect, probably to take possession of it. </p><p>No wonder the Qi had built up enough to be suffocating. </p><p>He tried to take over Markas silently, and once it failed, he escalated slightly, but his hands were bound, because he was not only trying to hide it from Entsa Pavilion, but also from his own sect. </p><p>“So, that’s how it was,” I muttered as everything that had been happening in Markas shifted, the things that had been incomprehensibly silly turned meaningful. “It’s not as bad as it could be.” </p><p>It was a great opportunity. Not only did I have enough Qi to literally create every single formation I wanted, but I could do so freely. With the commotion from Pearyin’s mystical disappearance, Kartpa Valley Elder wouldn’t dare to unravel the spiritual vein. At most, he would come to check the formation from outside. </p><p>Tricking him was easy with his talent. </p><p>First, I turned my attention to the spiritual vein, which was letting out only a fraction of what it could generate because of the formation sealing it. The formation around the spiritual vein was better than what was outside, but it didn’t feel like it was applied by an expert. </p><p>It was probably some kind of formation plate built by someone else. </p><p>It was better, but also it was designed for ease of use. I loosened it slightly, increasing the density of Qi even as I started using it to dig a tunnel that created that formation from outside, and connected it to my already existing detection formation. </p><p>“I’m so glad that I had designed the formation in a way that allowed me to modify it remotely,” I muttered even as I closed my eyes, and started using the remote nodes I had created for laying a huge formation on top of the previous detection one. </p><p>Turning Markas and the capital into a secret, impenetrable fortress. I had never even thought of creating something like that before, mostly because of the cost. A detection ward was easy. It cost merely fifty strands or so. </p><p>One that could actively defend and counter-attack without me present … absurdly expensive. </p><p>However, it didn’t matter, because the spiritual vein was more than enough. At most, I could loosen its restriction to provide even more. Such a vein was enough to satisfy the growth of thousands of Qi cultivators without a noticeable dip.</p><p>It was good to be rich … even if it came from the equivalent of robbing the mafia. </p><p>When I added the defensive and offensive layers, it was already dusk. But, I didn’t leave. While the spiritual vein was an amazing discovery, it wasn’t an instant win card. I didn’t even know if I could resist a Golden Core cultivator if they were really determined. I assumed so, but multiple ones would eventually break it. </p><p>No, I needed to build a distraction, one that would dissuade the elder from poking around … and before that, I needed to understand exactly what had been going on. And, there was only one source I could trust. </p><p>Back to the capital. </p><p>Even though I could feel multiple Formation Establishment cultivators floating around, I wasn’t afraid. The upgraded formation allowed me to manipulate the Qi of the spiritual vein even from a distance. There would be some efficiency loss, but it wouldn’t matter to anyone but the strongest. </p><p>When I arrived at the capital, Aisnam was at the palace, at a meeting. Later than usual, which was likely about the latest emergency. </p><p>I went to the house I designed as a drop house, and found multiple thick letters from Aisnam waiting for me. The letter was clearly penned in a hurry. </p><p>The first letter asked whether I knew anything about the sudden shift in the world, one that made comprehending palm techniques far easier to comprehend. </p><p>“Just how far did it spread,” I found myself asking. It clearly spread enough to cover the capital, but if it was the limit, the Foundation Establishment cultivators would have focused their search on the capital. Instead, they were spreading their search around in a huge pattern. </p><p>Curious, I decided to practice the palm techniques, and realized that the effect was still going on. Practicing the palm techniques was several times better … yet it faded the effect of doing so right next to the gate. </p><p>Then, I moved to the second letter. On that, it mostly repeated the same questions, followed by explaining several news she had received from her allies. In that letter, she explained the situation in more detail. </p><p>It was a mixed bag. The good news was the cultivators had no idea about the exact source of the event. She had mentioned some of the theories. Some thought that it was a secret land, while others believed it to be some kind of natural treasure appearing nearby, strong enough to increase people’s comprehension. There were no guesses about someone disappearing in a mysterious gate from a skill breakthrough. </p><p>Of course, just because Aisnam didn’t mention it didn’t mean that it didn’t actually exist. </p><p>The third order was asking for a truly huge number of essence cultivation resources, enough to build an army of thousands, to be paid in formation stones and other materials, far more than her previous resources could bring. I didn’t panic, as she openly mentioned it was a trade opportunity from her allies rather than something the Zaim Kingdom needed. </p><p>It was probably because some of the weaker cultivation families wanted to raise a high number of martial artists to search. </p><p>Excellent. </p><p>I wrote answers to all her queries, mostly acting like my organization didn’t know anything about either. I accepted her trade deal, and then left the capital. </p><p>My destination, was the border of the Linnass kingdom, though not one that it shared with Zaim kingdom. </p><p>Since the cultivators were searching for some kind of mystic ruined land, I would give them one. Right at the edge of the Linnass kingdom. </p><p>Of course, the location was not ideal. Once the mystic land was complete, a lot of cultivators would inevitably arrive, and some might decide to drift toward the Zaim kingdom. The earlier annoyance caused by the Linnass kingdom wasn’t enough for it. </p><p>Unfortunately, there was a limit I could expand my formation and still control it. Expanding it to Linnass was already the limit. Anything more, and I wasn’t confident to keep the transfer hidden. The best I could do was to place it in the empty wilderness there, and hope it didn’t spread into the mortal kingdoms too much. </p><p>The cultivators were supposed to stay away from them. I hoped that they would follow their creed. </p><p>Covering the distance didn’t take long. It might have taken longer if I had tried to expand the formation to cover the whole kingdom, but I chose to create a concealed line, more like a railroad, merely detecting a few miles on each side while transferring Qi to the target location. </p><p>Then, I arrived at the target. </p><p>It was time to build a fake mystic land… </p>",

Though, I didn’t want to do that unless it was my last resort. Interrupting her meditation would destroy her gains. </p><p>And, her improving strength was very important. Thanks to our cheat, she actually had the chance to become a sorceress. It was important, not just for our security, but also for my hopes of understanding what was going on with my body. </p><p>I was willing to risk facing a third-order beast alone for that possibility, though my confidence about retreating successfully played a big part in it. Ultimately, with my speed and senses,, I wasn’t risking anything but some time. </p><p>Even with my improved power, I wasn’t one to take pointless risks. I stayed concealed, waiting for the beast to arrive, to see if I could handle it alone. </p><p>However, I hit an unexpected snag. My new instincts shouted for me to go and deal with it alone, my blood pumping with forced excitement. Once again, the foreign instincts were trying to control me. I ignored them forcibly and stayed concealed. </p><p>Merely a minute later, I was glad for my decision. Soon, as the beast approached, I realized that it wasn’t alone. Its voice was overwhelming, but it was mixed with other beast sounds, mixed with shouts I couldn’t understand. </p><p>Germanic tribes. </p><p>As the shouts and howls got closer, my grip around my new spear tightened even more, ready to fight or escape as needed. However, as they approached, I was even more glad that I didn’t bring Lillian along. She was powerful, but my mobility and my ability to stay hidden would be far more important during the upcoming battle. </p><p>Soon, a huge wolf dashed into the opening, looking pitiful and majestic at the same time. Majestic, because just like what I had guessed, it was a third-order beast. A wolf of water element, in particular, with its blue fur carrying hints of blue even as its immediate surroundings turned into mist, the ground turning muddy. </p><p>Just like mages of the same order, the third-order beasts were able to express their natures outwardly, radiating their mana and transforming their environment. They couldn’t use their mana as directly as a human mage, but that was hardly a weakness when they could use it to transform their surroundings and counter the magic of the mages. </p><p>It would have been bad enough if suppressing the spells of the others was the only thing they could do. They could still use elemental effects. They were often simpler than human abilities, but not weaker. Then, there were their naturally strong bodies, which only got stronger after their transformation, turning the third-order beasts into a true disaster. </p><p>One by one, they facing against them was disaster all but the strongest third-order mages, like the poor pirate captain we had dealt with. </p><p>Yet, for all its majesty, the beast was pitiful as well. Its body was littered with wounds, its fur dirty and damaged, showing that it had been running away for a long time. </p><p>Then, I noticed something else that was interesting. A woman, barely hanging on its back, her magic mixing with the beast. A redhead, wearing the traditional garb of a priestess. </p><p>A beast tamer, I realized even as I noticed the desperate way she hung to the beast, her eyes firmly closed as she infused her mana to the beast desperately. Interesting, I thought even as I watched her struggle from my hiding spot, trying to understand what was going on. She was clearly a third-order entity as well, but she was able to control a third-order beast. </p><p>I didn’t know much about beast taming, but I knew that it was a formidable feat. </p><p>Her appearance was truly a stroke of fortune. The only reason we were at the border was to get in contact with the tribes, planning to interact with them for weeks and trade with them, hoping to get some of the secrets of their unique magic. Yet, no matter what we offered, the best we could hope was some peripheral secrets. </p><p>Far less than a priestess would know. </p><p>Yet, I stayed concealed, watching her. The opportunity might be great, but I didn’t want to show myself before understanding what she was facing. I was ready to follow if she continued to run, but she did not. Instead, she opened her eyes, looking around desperately, searching for something. </p><p>I guessed it quickly. While she was running away, she felt my botched vitae refinement, and mistook it for some kind of natural mana treasure. And, since it matched the element of her tamed beast, she hoped to use it as a last-second boost as desperate hope. </p><p>Unfortunately, it didn’t work. Before she could start running once more, several figures appeared. Five people, each riding second-order wolves that looked very similar to the third-order beast she was riding, and six men that were on foot. </p><p>The six men looked even more striking than the wolves, as the lower half of their bodies were shaped as a mixture of wolf and human, giving them speed that was impossible to match by a human. </p><p>Supposed to be impossible to match, I corrected a moment later, remembering my own condition. But then, wasn’t the reason I needed their knowledge was because my own humanity was at risk. Looking at them, I felt more confident about Lillian’s decision to seek their knowledge. </p><p>They shouted at each other while I carefully got closer to them, but I didn’t hurry up. Their hostility was obvious, but their intention to take the woman prisoner was equally obvious. I didn’t react when they started shouting at each other. I didn’t react even when they started fighting. </p><p>I was glad for it, as one of the men who was riding a wolf attacked the woman with an earth spike, showing his identity as an elemental mage. It surprised me, as to my — admittedly limited — knowledge, Germanic tribes detested the use of the elemental magic for some reason, thinking it as sacrilege. </p><p>The third-order wolf charged toward the mage while the priestess desperately tried to heal it. However, the shapeshifters were carrying huge spears, and they harassed the wolf from the side, preventing it from reaching the target. </p><p>Spears that looked suspiciously like legionnaire weapons, making me wonder whether elemental mage tribal was just a coincidence or a part of the conspiracy. After all, it wouldn’t be the first time Rome suborned the locals to their side by money and knowledge. It was one of the reasons it spread into three continents, even with Romans spending more time fighting with each other than foreigners. </p><p>However, as I continued to approach, I ignored the potential conspiracy and paid more attention to their tactics instead. The tribals worked well, though ironically reminding me of a wolf pack. They never faced the third-order beast directly. Whenever it attacked the mage, he tricked the beast with spikes and earth walls while he retreated, while shifters attacked with their spears. </p><p>At the same time, whenever it tried to shift direction to attack one of the shifters, the mage focused on offense, delivering more and more attacks. </p><p>Soon, one of the earth spikes found its target, stabbing toward its eye. A magnificent howl escaped to highlight the tragedy as its eye was ruined. </p><p>The moment it happened, something shifted. The wolf howled again, but it was more feral and desperate. I had to focus on my mana senses to understand the reason. The spell that was keeping it under control shattered, and it turned feral. </p><p>And, with it, any sense of control disappeared. Ignoring the fight, it turned and ran away despite the threat, its sudden shift enough to throw the redhead from its back. She hit the ground hard, dazed due to a combination of the fall and the backlash of her spell. </p><p>I waited silently, waiting for an opportunity. If I appeared now, I would be facing a substantial force that could rival me physically, but also supported by a mage. Or, I could follow them until their readiness had weakened. It would take more time, but it would be much safer. </p><p>Then, that plan turned unnecessary, because they had made a move that surprised me greatly. The mage had given an order. I didn’t understand the words, but the order itself was easy to understand. The mage, and the shifters dashed to chase the injured wolf, clearly not willing to let go of such an incredible treasure. </p><p>Leaving four riders to capture the priestess. </p>",

    "content": "<p>The next few days passed in a routine as we steadily traveled toward the border. Our journey slowed down slightly due to my need to … keep my mana build-up low, but otherwise, it passed in a surprisingly calm routine. </p><p>Then, we started to get near the Rhine, the border of Rome, and travel started to get more challenging. For multiple reasons. Reasons I couldn’t help but think even as we prepared another camp.</p><p> The first reason was the military presence. Germanic tribes often raided the border to bolster their limited riches. That was something that was known even back in Britannia. And, as a result, there were a lot of patrols at the border, not just legionnaires, but also local auxiliary forces. They operated in multiple layers, making it difficult to pass them. </p><p>Unfortunately, that was not the biggest problem. The beasts were. </p><p>In most civilized areas, the beasts were not a big problem, their numbers kept low due to constant hunts. Unfortunately, the same didn’t apply to the border. A proper hunting expedition was difficult to organize when fearing the constant ambushes. So, the area near the Rhine River was teeming with second-order beasts, and third-order beasts were also common. </p><p>I would never dare to camp so near the river if it wasn’t for my enhanced senses. </p><p>“At least I could still use magic,” Lillian muttered as she used her water spells to dig a hole through a cliff to create a better residence. </p><p>“One advantage of beast density. The ambient mana is thick enough to conceal magic unless we use it as a burst,” I said. “Try not to widen the entrance too much. We are going to stay here for a while.” </p><p>“Until we could contact one of the tribes and arrange a trade,” I said, going over the plan. “Assuming, of course, we could convince someone.” </p><p>She smirked. “As long as we can take down third-order beasts for trade, it shouldn’t be too difficult to find a trainer. I doubt anyone takes the risk of raiding the border unless they are in dire need. We should be able to come to a deal.” </p><p>“True,” I said as I fell silent, focusing on preparing our semi-permanent camp. I doubted that connecting with the tribes would be as easy as Lillian hoped, meaning we would have to stay here for a while, making some extra effort worth it.</p><p>Lillian interrupted the silence a while later. “Do you think there’s any fourth-order beast here,” Lillian asked. </p><p>“I don’t know,” I answered. “What I know about fourth-order beasts is limited, but I know they are smarter than the others. If there are any, they would stay in even more mana-dense locations to keep away from the soldiers. Or, they would have been hunted already.” </p><p>It was inevitable. If a third-order beast was a treasure, then a fourth-order beast was worth a king’s ransom. Even the weakest and smallest of them would be worth a lot, enough to mobilize a cohort or two meaning they were hard to find in easily accessible locations. </p><p>Like the edge of a river. </p><p>Therefore, even if there was any beast, they must be living somewhere hard to access, likely under a thicker cloud of mana. There were several such spots along the river, but we avoided them while picking our hiding spot, afraid that those would be watched by the patrols. </p><p> “I can handle the rest. You should start meditating,” I reminded her once I saw she had finished digging the cave. </p><p>“I can help—” she started, but I interrupted her. </p><p>“I need you to consume the mana you have taken. The build-up is getting too much already,” I reminded her, and she blushed. </p><p>“Right,” she muttered, shy and frustrated at the same time. I could understand her frustration. As much as the process of draining the mana was fun, the speed my body regenerated was making it more of a challenge than we expected. </p><p>On the positive side, she was getting far stronger. With my mana easily converted into vitae, her power had gone through a qualitative change. While she still needed to work on her finesse, from a pure power perspective, she was as strong as the pirate captain we had dealt with. </p><p>Too bad it came with dangerous side effects. </p><p>The passage of a few days had been enough to make some radical changes in my body. I was even faster and stronger, with more endurance … but I also sported several more scales along my body. </p><p>Frustrating. </p><p>“I’m going for a walk,” I called Lillian even as I reluctantly walked away from the cave, leaving the work half-complete. I could always finish it later. I needed to clear my mind. </p><p>As I walked, I noticed a tree radiating mana. I broke one of its branches that looked straight, and started working on slowly whittling it away. I wanted to make myself a new weapon. It wasn’t strictly necessary as I had some bone daggers, but I liked spears as much as swords. More importantly, working on a weapon distracted me properly. </p><p>As my hands danced on the surface of the branch, I kept my eyes closed, focusing inwardly. For the first time since the accident, I was in a mana-dense location, and I could actually experiment on my damaged elemental cores. </p><p>There was not much change inside me. The crystal of the dragon heart was still embedded in my heart, radiating mana with every throb. The four elemental cores stayed in their place, deflated with no sign of movement.</p><p>It was the time to experiment. </p><p>I decided to start with the water core. Originally, water wasn’t my strongest aspect, but due to the unique medical intervention of Lillian to manage my mana, I developed more familiarity with water vitae with more than I had previously, particularly on the aspects of growth, nurturing, and healing. Considering my conditions, those aspects were beneficial. </p><p>I closed my eyes, focusing on channeling my mana to the water core, slowly repairing the punctured point. It was an expensive process, but luckily, one thing I hadn’t been lacking. It didn’t even cause a noticeable dip. Ironically, I would have preferred it to consume more, relieving the pressure I had been dealing with. </p><p>Slowly, the elemental core was repaired, being reinforced until the initial puncture point had turned much stronger. With that done, I channeled the mana to the core, while delving into the concept of water, trying to imagine a calm river, flowing endlessly as it nurtured everything around it, trying to create a particularly passive variant of vitae. </p><p>It was a softer variant than my original, but I deliberately chose it. Once successful, I would expand its features more, but, to start, healing and nurturing were the better options. I kept my eyes closed, immersing myself in the sensation to trigger the generation of vitae. </p><p>Then, just as the first drop of vitae had been generated, I felt the crystal in my heartthrob. At the same time, I felt the mental image change and transform. The calm, steady river I had been trying to keep in my mind shattered, replaced by a merciless, devastating flood, covering everything in sight, and wreaking havoc. </p><p>At the same time, I could feel the patched spot of my elemental core being destroyed, and the sole drop of the elemental vitae I had generated drifting toward the dragon heart like it was being forcibly pulled. I expected it to be devoured.</p><p>Instead, it had been evaporated. </p><p>My eyes widened. Not because of the destruction of the vitae, as while it was an incredibly important medium, the vitae was hardly indestructible. The problem was borne from a different aspect. </p><p>The destruction of the vitae created a flare. Thankfully, it hadn’t been a strong flare, and with the relatively dense mana radiance, there was a chance that no one had noticed it. All I needed was some luck and —</p><p>Then, I heard a howl. It was loud enough to reverberate in my bones, telling me that my hopes of going undetected went wrong. The howl was strong, magically charged, too strong not to belong to a third-order beast. </p><p>A wolf, in particular. </p><p>I grabbed the primitive spear I had just completed. It looked like it would see combat sooner than I had expected. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Lost in her success, Daria didn’t pay attention to my footsteps. I was tempted to sneak, but once again, her power dissuaded me. Instead, as I approached, I made sure to stomp a bit harder, so when I stood behind her, she was just acting like she didn’t notice my presence. </p><p>“I’m sure you finished searching that region,” I said. “Why don’t you continue.” </p><p>Daria pulled back, smirking. “Why? Are you afraid that I’ll steal her.” </p><p>“Maybe,” I said amusingly. “After all, you’re so good at seduction. I can never rival you,” I added, goading her. </p><p>“Of course—” she started, but I interrupted her. </p><p>“Too bad my little bouncer wouldn’t allow you,” I said with a sudden shift in tone, growling in faux-anger as I gestured, and Tara pushed her against the table, hard enough to make an explosive sound. Painful, but not enough to ruin her fun. “I think you are yet to finish searching her,” I said as I patted Tara’s naked shoulder, whose shivers of excitement were far stronger than the time Daria was licking her desperately. </p><p>It was good to see I still had a hold on her. </p><p>Tara started fingering Daria with one hand, the other on her back, keeping her pinned. Daria moaned. </p><p>“Keep it slow. We don’t want to miss anything,” I said to Tara even as I unbuttoned her pants and pushed them down along with her panties. Soon, my fingers were at her wet entrance, replicating the treatment she delivered to Daria. </p><p>“Try to hold back, my little informant,” I said to Daria with a chuckle. “The first one to cum would lose her reward.” </p><p>That made both beauties stiffen at once. Daria followed it with a moan, but that was more about Tara’s fingers, picking up speed. I immediately slapped her ass. “No cheating,” I warned even as I matched up her speed until she slowed down. </p><p>Meanwhile, Daria growled in satisfaction. She might be enjoying her position, but as a famous hero, she was too competitive to ignore my earlier challenge. Despite her pinned position, she glanced backward, no doubt hoping that Tara’s climax wasn’t too far away even without her contribution. </p><p>I could have certainly done so if I felt like it, as my Observation allowed me to play with Tara as I wished. I knew how to give her pleasure, and I knew how to break the pace of pleasure she was enjoying with a few innocent touches, breaking her composure. </p><p>Unfortunately, those skills applied reverse as well. I could easily keep Tara on the edge, both as a punishment, and as a challenge to Daria. And, when her gaze caught mine, I immediately confirmed my intention with a big smirk. </p><p>The growl of frustration she let out after realizing the competition wasn’t as easy as she had first thought was simply beautiful. And, as the pleasure built up, the competition started to lose its importance to her climax. </p><p>She moaned exaggeratedly as she shook her ass, trying to goad Tara to win. Unfortunately for her, after my warning, Tara stayed true to my order. “Please, faster,” Daria moaned, but Tara ignored her begging, maintaining her stoic silence. </p><p>“What’s the hurry, red,” I said teasingly. </p><p>“U-use my name,” she answered shyly. </p><p>“I don’t know,” I said, tempted to do something dangerous. “The name Amelia doesn’t fit you. It feels fake.” The way she froze was beautiful, but she assumed it to be just an offhand remark rather than a pointed statement. </p><p>I smirked, enjoying the stretch of silence. </p><p>“Still, don’t call me red!” she answered, more aggressively than the situation required to cover up her earlier reaction. “Amelia is the perfect name.” </p><p>I chuckled, as even as she argued her hips didn’t stop, trying to take Tara’s fingers deeper. Her panties, pushed to the side, had turned into a drenched mess, unable to contain her dripping arousal. “If you say so.” </p><p>“What does your loyal bodyguard think,” she asked. Tara didn’t respond without my permission. “Is she a mute?” </p><p>“She doesn’t like small talk,” I replied for her. As much as I wanted to let her play a bit more, I wasn’t confident that she could continue her role while speaking. Unlike body language, there were too many mistakes that could be made while speaking. </p><p>“B-boring —” she started, trying to goad Tara. It would have been a daring choice if Tara was a cutthroat criminal like she displayed, but it was only fun. Still, that didn’t mean I would let her continue to disrespect my beautiful and loyal employee. </p><p>“Make sure she doesn’t speak,” I told Tara, pointing to what I meant. Tara didn’t make a sound as she ripped them easily, and stuffed them to Daria’s mouth, silencing her. Meanwhile, her other hand continued to caress Daria’s wetness. </p><p>Playing her role, being silenced like that increased Daria’s pleasure even more. Her body tensed as she started to react to Tara’s fingers even more, the aggression paying incredible dividends. It was fun to see that, despite her heroic persona, which was belligerent and dominant, she was acting like a party girl. </p><p>Soon, she started shuddering. “You lost,” I said even as I stopped teasing Tara, and walked to the other end of the table. However, even as I pulled her panties down, I was pulling out my shaft. “Now, it’s time for your punishment.” </p><p>She opened her mouth, not to argue, but to get her so-called punishment. Not that she looked torn up about the situation, even as her mouth parted, devouring my length completely. </p><p>Her gasp echoed in the room for a moment before it was muffled by my invasion. I pushed in deep mercilessly, invading her throat. Tara’s fingers weren’t any slower as they invaded her core, throwing her earlier slow pace away under my command. </p><p>Even as I invaded Daria’s throat, forcing her to gag repeatedly, my gaze was on Tara, sharing an intimate look. In any other situation, the gaze would have been romantic, but having a sexy redhead between us, behind treated as a toy, calling it romantic was a big stretch. </p><p>Still, I could see just how much Tara was enjoying the moment, which was a win. Even as she fingered Daria, her half-naked body swayed, putting her beautiful tits to a perfect display. </p><p>Soon, her body swayed even more, forcing her to spread her legs apart to maintain her balance. Her body arched back until it turned into a beautiful bridge, chest thrust towards her while her hands were still busy with Daria. </p><p>She didn’t stay in that position for long. Soon, her pleasure started to get too intense, and she started shivering, climaxing. All without a touch. </p><p>Meanwhile, Daria was busy gagging and moaning deliriously, losing herself even more than in our previous adventure. I kept my shaft in her throat, pushing her closer and closer to the unconsciousness. Yet, even as the lack of oxygen started to get overwhelming, she climaxed rather than panicking, intense enough for her to lose any sense. </p><p>I couldn’t help but chuckle as I realized something. For all her confidence in her power, I could push her a bit more, and she would fall unconscious. The great and scary Blue Princess, taken down by sex. </p><p>Yet, I pulled just before she fell unconscious. She was lucky that I was merely acting as if I worked for the Syndicate rather than actually working for them, or she would have likely ended up </p><p>Well, theoretically. There was also the chance that her power would activate automatically if she fell unconscious, but it was not something I could guess even with my power, if I was working for the Syndicate, it would have been a risk worth taking. </p><p>Though, for a moment, I wondered if it would be alright to push her, and make her destroy the bar. That way, I could get away from the Syndicate with relatively little loss, and even disappear safely. Instead, I pulled back. </p><p>The reason for it was simple. </p><p>Greed. </p><p>Maybe it was arrogant, but after everything I had accomplished during my accidental bid, I got a taste of power. Maybe I could retreat safely by making her destroy the bar, but it would also make sure that I could never appear in the world of supers again. The heroes would treat me as a villain, while villains would treat me as a dangerous source of instability. </p><p>No, I thought even as I helped Daria stand up, enjoying the way she needed against me. I wouldn’t stop now, not when everything was aligned for me to make a bid for power. I didn’t need much. Just establishing myself as a third-rate power was enough to secure my living forever. </p><p>“W-what,” Daria muttered. </p><p>“You wanted to see the security records,” I said as I dragged her to my office. “Let’s go see them.” </p><p>“Shouldn’t I dress first,” she muttered. </p><p>“Oh, you won’t need your clothes yet,” I replied. </p><p>Yes, I didn’t want to give up my meager power just yet… </p>",

    "content": "<p>Daria said nothing even as Tara removed her leather jacket and patted it before discarding it, just trembling with excitement, letting herself swept into the fantasy, showing enthusiasm for Tara’s involvement. </p><p>It was good. With Tara to potentially distract her, I could check her phone without alerting her. Not to mention, joining was a reward for Tara as well. I could see that she was excited even as she followed my commands perfectly. </p><p>Tara managed to hide her excitement somewhat. Daria wasn’t as successful as she was left wearing only her sexy boots, panties, and a misaligned tube top. Then, Tara grabbed her top and ripped it off with incredible ease. Daria moaned, going even deeper into the land of pleasure, even as her panties remained the only piece of clothing that protected her chastity. </p><p>Deficient protection. Luckily, she didn’t have much chastity to protect. </p><p>“Pat her down. We don’t want any skin-colored hidden patches transmitting information,” I said. </p><p>“Of course, I don’t …” Daria started, only for her argument to die as Tara followed my silent order, and put her hands on her stomach, caressing erotically. Daria’s gaze shifted, checking Tara from the mirror, who was still in her full biker gear. “I see. One can’t be too careful,” she complied. </p><p>As she said that, she put her elbows on the counter and propped her chin in her hand, studying me through her cloudy eyes and thick, long lashes, lost in pleasure yet utterly secure as her red hair sprawled. One of the things that appealed to me about her was that even though she used her charm and femininity relentlessly to look vulnerable, she had no concept of true vulnerability. Even as she leaned against the bar of a seedy establishment, being patted by a super, she was utterly confident. </p><p>Not that I could blame her after seeing her in action. Even with her waning powers, she was a true powerhouse. </p><p>Tempted to play with her further, I gestured for Tara to take her search slowly. She complied instantly, as her fingers danced on Daria’s stomach with a tender crawl. Daria was excited at first, but soon her eyes narrowed, realizing how slowly things were going. </p><p>I smirked, showing her that it was intentional. She stared at me in frustration for a moment. Then she tilted back her head, as if to accept the challenge. “Maybe I should make sure your bouncer doesn’t have a hidden camera as well. After all, my reputation is on the line,” she said. </p><p>Suddenly, I was very glad about our previous encounter. Before it, I could have never accepted such a suggestion without tipping her that I caught onto her identity. Luckily, after our adventure in the bike shop, it fitted our little dance perfectly. </p><p>“Well, as long as you can convince her,” I said. “After all, I can’t order my employee to get naked. It would be harassment.” </p><p>“And, that’s a crime.” </p><p>“Exactly, I would never dare to commit a crime,” I responded mockingly. Daria laughed, which was a beautiful sound, throaty and rich. The fact that it made her beautiful — and mostly naked — body tremble made her joy even more spectacular. </p><p>“If you say so,” she said even as I gestured to Tara again, and she walked toward one of the empty seats. Daria watched her saunter with great interest — as Tara might not be too experienced, but her abilities allowed her to learn how to walk sexy — before she sat down. Another hidden gesture from me, and she removed her helmet, revealing her face. </p><p>I expected her to be blushing and excited, yet she wore a stony expression. I was impressed. If it wasn’t for my power, I would have actually believed in her expression. However, under the surface, thanks to her micro-expressions, I could see her excitement battling with her shyness. Yet, to her credit, she managed to keep both bottled in.</p><p>Just because I ordered, showing me that, even after everything, I was underestimating the depths of her submissiveness. </p><p>Daria, on the other hand, just looked more excited. Since she lacked my ability to read people, she assumed that Tara was another dangerous criminal with great experience, which worked to feed her fantasy. Yet, even as she slowly closed in the distance, the way she shook her hips was aimed at me. </p><p>It continued even when she plopped herself on Tara’s lap, and started rubbing herself. It was a good lap dance, but I had to admit. I particularly enjoyed the fact that, even as she rubbed her body coyly against Tara, I enjoyed the fact that I was still the focus of her attention. And, the same was true for Tara. It was still a show for me. </p><p>The fact that two incredibly beautiful and powerful woman were doing their best to entertain me did good things for my ego. However, as much as I wanted to go and join them, I stayed in place. Instead, I smirked even as I poured myself a glass of my best bourbon, and watched them. </p><p>I had two reasons for it. First, I didn’t want to interrupt Tara’s reward. More importantly, Daria was clearly angling to seduce me, and while I planned to ultimately join that, it wasn’t something I wanted to do immediately. After all, unlike Tara, Daria was not a natural submissive. Her current vulnerable state was an excellent chance to graft some of those habits onto her. </p><p>But, before that, I needed to put her into a more receptive state. Time was on my side. </p><p>I watched as Daria rocked repeatedly on Tara’s lap, catching my gaze invitingly. I just took a sip from my drink, acting like I was watching a TV show, one that was entertaining enough to kill time, but not truly captivating. </p><p>The expression of frustration on her face was as beautiful as her naked body,. That soon turned into ambition as she stood up, only to sit back facing Tara. She pressed her face to Tara’s neck, slowly kissing while she grabbed her jacket and removed it, revealing the simple t-shirt underneath, one that still looked sexy as Tara’s nipples pressed against the white fabric to show her lack of a bra. </p><p>Her breasts were more honest than her face. </p><p>I couldn’t see Daria’s expression, but from her body language, I could guess that she was smirking. Without stopping to kiss her neck, she brought her hands lower and started playing with Tara’s nipples, twisting to earn a moan. </p><p>I barely held back a chuckle when I noticed Tara’s lack of chuckle. Tara was very vulnerable to some rough teasing, but there was a reason for it. The invulnerability aspect of her power didn’t work on a percentage. Instead, it activated for any pain above a certain threshold. With my power, I could easily stay below that, but Daria didn’t have the same experience. </p><p>Worse, when she noticed her lack of a reaction, she decided to squeeze even harder. It didn’t work either. I chuckled, while Daria wrote off the rougher side of the spectrum completely. </p><p>Instead, she grabbed Tara’s shirt, and pulled it up. Tara raised her arms, revealing her upper body. Daria froze as she pulled it up, looking at Tara’s tits in shock, not expecting them to be that big. Her reaction was understandable, as Tara had been wearing some deceptive clothing to hide her curves, which apparently succeeded even with their closeness. </p><p>Or maybe, she was just captured by their supernatural perkiness. </p><p>Either way, for the first time since she arrived, her attention was not on me. “Well, we have to make sure that nothing is hidden around them,” she growled, almost like their mere perfection was an insult to her. It was misguided at best, as while Tara’s tits were perfect, Daria had nothing to be ashamed of either. </p><p>However, I wasn’t bothered by that misunderstanding when Daria decided to get even by pressing her lips against Tara’s great expanse. Her lips danced on her tits, creating a beautiful spiral until she reached her target and captured Tara’s nipple, playing with it. </p><p>Then, a playful bite that stayed under her power threshold triggered a moan from Tara, finally giving Daria what she had been looking for. Her first explicit success was in her self-appointed seduction challenge. </p><p> I chuckled even as I finished my drink and started walking toward them. I had let her play enough. </p><p>Now, it was time to join the fun. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“What the hell!” I gasped even as I tried to follow Pearyin, but the gate was already gone, leaving only a persistent glow where the gate was, showing the outline of the gate. That glow allowed me to practice my techniques far more efficiently, but I didn’t care about it. </p><p>I was trying to understand what was going on, but no matter how much what formation I had used, it didn’t help. My knowledge about it was truly limited. </p><p>After an hour, I stopped trying to find out what had happened. It was clearly above my understanding. The best I could hope was to hope that, just like other events that had been triggered when skills had reached their next stage, it was harmless. </p><p>At least, that was what I hoped. </p><p>The only good thing was that the door stayed, giving me the hope that it might also allow her to return. Assuming, of course, it wasn’t destroyed. Though, it didn’t matter. I had to keep the area safe whether the gate could be destroyed or not. </p><p>If I let someone else capture it, even if the gate couldn’t be destroyed, Pearyin would fall into their hands. Not something I would allow for her. </p><p>I was planning to stay in the dojo until the evening, waiting to see if Pearyin could appear soon … when I felt a warning from the formation. Another cultivator was here. One that was stronger than the others. Foundation Establishment, and from what I could feel, not a weak one either. </p><p>“When it rains…” I muttered in frustration as I continued running toward the capital. I was confident in dealing with a Foundation Establishment cultivator, but only if I was already at the capital and activated some of the protections. </p><p>I didn’t have any confidence otherwise. </p><p>As I continued to run, I wondered why the other faction in the Verdant family reacted so rapidly. I had already covered the distance halfway before I realized that I hadn’t misjudged it. </p><p>The Foundation Establishment Cultivator was not moving toward the capital, but circling as if they were searching for something. They must have been looking for me —</p><p>Then, I noticed another Foundation Establishment cultivator, this time near Markas, staying the range of formations before going away. Another appeared … then another. </p><p>“Can they be looking for Pearyin?” I asked. I had done my best to contain the aura, but there was a chance I failed. After all, what happened was too mysterious. However, even with that possibility, I didn’t return to the formation.</p><p>There was very little I could do if I returned. </p><p>I had done my best to keep that valley concealed. And, even with the hundreds of spirit plants, the formation had its limits. I could keep a Foundation Establishment cultivator away for a time, but not for long. Eventually, that Qi would be depleted, and I would be defeated. </p><p>I could defeat two Foundation Cultivators if I took the offense rather than defending passively, maybe even more … but considering the speed they mobilized at least two Foundation Establishment cultivators, they would send more and more. </p><p>“Damn,” I growled. I didn’t want to abandon Pearyin. But, I couldn’t just trust my formation would stay hidden. I had no idea just how many cultivators that would be searching. </p><p>I needed something stronger, something that would give me an edge over the sect cultivators if they decided to move on en-masse. My mind inevitably went to the mysterious being imprisoned under the capital, wondering whether I should try to earn their pity. It would be risky, but it felt like the best method. </p><p>Or, maybe I should risk it and improve my cultivation. That seemed like the best way — </p><p>“The Kartpa Valley artifact,” I suddenly muttered as I interrupted my own thoughts as I reversed direction, and moved deeper into the Markas territory. I had long identified the location of the artifact they had been using to boost the growth of the plants and savage beasts. </p><p>While that artifact wouldn’t be enough to support the formation, it would be different if I could recycle it once through Aisnam. Of course, I needed to find a creative way to do so that would not only prevent her from getting suspicious, but also trigger the System. </p><p>But, I didn’t want to waste time thinking about the exact method, because the size and the nature of the artifact they had been using to generate Qi mattered. It would be easy if it was something palm-sized, and less so if it was as big as a house. </p><p>I had to admit, whatever the source was, they hid it well. If it wasn’t for my gardening skills, I would have to spend weeks searching for the source. Instead, I immediately reached the source, which was sealed with a formation. </p><p>“Pathetic,” I muttered even as I examined the formation despite the intimidating power it was radiating off it. Most of the intimidation came from the material of the formation. It was still Qi, but unlike what I had been using, which was less dense than the air itself, it had a more liquid, robust feel. </p><p>It was applied by a Golden Core cultivator, one that wasn’t very skilled. The condensed nature of the Qi made the formation far more intimidating, but the strength of the walls didn’t matter when the lock was not complicated. </p><p>A few touches, and the formation shifted slightly, creating a small gate for me to enter the protected area, without disrupting the rest of the formation. “Skills are amazing … if only they didn’t come with a spontaneous disappearance feature,” I muttered, unable to resist thinking about Pearyin’s sudden disappearance. </p><p>Every single detail about the process made me feel that it was harmless, but regardless, I didn’t want to experience it myself, not unless I had no other choice. I had already experienced spontaneous interdimensional travel once, and I wasn’t looking to repeat the experience. </p><p>Especially since I had no idea what was on the other side. </p><p>“In a way, I was lucky,” I muttered even as I stepped through the gap I had created. While I didn’t appreciate the risk Pearyin had experienced, it was better than the alternative. With the way I had been using the System, it would have been long before I would have a chance to surpass the Major Integration stage, and once that chance arrived, I would have traveled to Misty Mountains to trigger it. </p><p>I would have set formations, but none of those formations would have expected the coordinated search of Foundation Establishment cultivators. And, with I was lost in whatever mysterious place that gate led, the remains of the gate would be inevitably discovered, surrounded, and maybe destroyed… </p><p>Not exactly a good fate. </p><p>“I have just avoided a calamity, lucky me —” I muttered as I finally arrived at the other side of the formation, only to be slammed by a wave of Qi so thick that, for a moment I thought I was under attack. </p><p>I was already ready to defend myself when I realized it was just the density of Qi, alone to make it difficult to breathe. It was a lot. I realized whatever artifact Kartpa Valley had used was not simple. </p><p>I didn’t try to measure just how much Qi there was in terms of strands. It would be as meaningless as trying to measure a lake by drops. As always, the answer was … too much. The good news, it was enough for me to use a lot of Foundation Establishment cultivators. </p><p>Bad news, since Kartpa Valley had put such a valuable artifact here just to take over a mortal city, there had to be something even more important. Even worse, I didn’t have the luxury of just turning back and leaving the place. </p><p>Even now, I could feel the number of Foundation Establishment Cultivators above Marks and Capital increasing. Currently, there were five, and inevitably, there were even more nearby. </p><p>The only saving grace was that their search pattern indicated that they didn’t all belong to the same force, and they were afraid of each other. That, and they were clearly searching blindly, showing that my formations were at least somewhat effective. </p><p>I thought about how best to use the artifact to counter them. I hoped that it was enough to be carried easily, allowing me to add some more confusion, but even if it wasn’t, I should be able to move it with my formations. It wouldn’t take long, but as long as it was under my base, everything would be fine. “Still, it’s lucky. At least, it’ll solve my current problem once I —” I started, only to freeze when I reached a large underground cave. </p><p>With a huge spiritual vein. </p><p>“Damn it. When I will learn about tempting fate,” I muttered as I looked at the mystical crystal, one the most famous wonders of the world. A treasure that was even more valuable than a giant oil field back on Earth, enough to trigger wars. </p><p>A treasure that was already discovered by one of the strongest sects of the continent. </p><p>Suddenly, the problem with Pearyin didn’t look too bad. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Once the threats of the assassination had ended, my next destination was Markas. Particularly, the valley I had created for Pearyin. It was time for another visit. </p><p>I ignored the forts of the Tiger Fist army. Their construction had slowed down significantly after their latest change of strategy, focusing on the rebellion rather than Markas. I didn’t go there either. I had already extended the outer layer of the detection formation to the city, so I didn’t need to check periodically. </p><p>The moment I stepped through the protective layers, I was greeted by a wave of pure Qi. And, immediately, a sense of comfort enveloped me. I wasn’t suffering from the danger of Qi starvation with my inventory full of Qi, but the sensation of comfort was different. </p><p>It was like breathing using an oxygen canister and walking around in the mountains, but the difference had only turned noticeable after Qi concentration had reached a certain point. </p><p>No wonder most cultivators didn’t like leaving their sects. </p><p>Pearyin was once again at the center of the valley, surrounded by trees and flowers as she meditated. She was merely at the Third Stage, contrasting greatly with the amount of Qi she had absorbed during the past two weeks.</p><p>I approached without alerting her, examining her cultivation speed. She still built her gates instinctively, but the speed she absorbed was different, occasionally slowing down and picking up speed. “It looks like you can control your cultivation better. Good work,” I said. </p><p>Her eyes opened, her concentrated expression turning into a beautiful smile. “Sir, you’re here,” she said with a beautiful smile. “Do you have any orders?” </p><p>I opened my mouth to say no, but at the last minute, I changed my mind. “Actually, yes. I’m going to give you another task,” I said as I moved toward my cottage, which I had yet to use. “I want you to build another building here. It’ll be my library, and you’ll be tasked to guard it,” I said. </p><p>“You can trust me, sir. I won’t step inside, or let anyone walk in.” </p><p>I waved my hand. “No, you can walk in and read anything you want. Just don’t take them outside the building,” I said. The library was another excuse to bypass the System restrictions. The System didn’t like me giving things away, but letting someone else use them, as long as I maintained ownership, was not a problem. </p><p>Then, I removed the three scrolls from the System. </p><p>Her eyes widened as she looked at the scrolls. I didn’t blame her, because even I was impressed with them. Of the three techniques, three of them were Peak-Yellow Quality, and one of them was Low-Black. Also, all three were impressive cultivation techniques, each with its own aura. Holding all three of them in my hand, even I felt intimidated. </p><p>Nine Draws Mirage Dagger felt almost invisible, but also radiated a sense of sharpness. It was a confusing juxtaposition, which would have been meaningless if it wasn’t for my expertise with a similar technique. </p><p>A similar confusing sensation also affected the other two techniques. </p><p>“Why don’t you start building the library first, then you can read them,” I offered. </p><p>Pearyin bowed enthusiastically as she started using her Qi to take down a few trees and started processing them. </p><p>Meanwhile, I opened the first scroll. The Furious Palm of Nine Tsunami. I started with that because of two reasons. The first, I already had two palm techniques, and even the weaker one was at Perfection, which gave me the best chance to understand the technique without any potential nasty side effects. </p><p>Also, I wanted to see if there was anything wrong with it before passing it to Pearyin. </p><p>As I unfurled the scroll, I was glad that I started like that. The aura it radiated intensified, and I felt suffocated, like I was trying to push through endless waves trying to bury me. </p><p>Tsunami indeed. </p><p>Still, it took a few seconds for me to take that mental illusion under control as I focused on comprehending the technique … a process that had gone surprisingly well. A few minutes later, I was able to replicate the first move easily. An hour later, when Pearyin was putting the finishing touches, I could move through all nine moves. </p><p>It was merely at Beginner competency, but still an impressive achievement. It looked like my initial assumption about similar techniques creating a basis for the technique was even more correct. </p><p>“Do you want to study this?” I said as I passed the technique to Pearyin. Meanwhile, I opened the next technique. Desolate Quake of Seven Swings … and promptly closed it when the aura slammed against me like an angry bull. </p><p>I had thought that the sensation of being suffocated was bad enough, but it was nothing compared to the effect of the saber technique. It was like trying to run through an earthquake on a metal surface, which had been shattering and forming sabers that attacked me. </p><p>It was a mere illusion and nothing more, but it actually rattled my gates, forcing me to repair them with some subdued Qi. It was a minor injury, but it would have taken an ordinary cultivator a week to repair. </p><p>I didn’t work with that technique, merely a minute, or maybe five. The aura made it a bit confusing. However, either way, that time was enough for Pearyin to not only comprehend the Furious Palm technique, but also raise it to a level I couldn’t assess. Easily, Minor accomplishment. </p><p>Or, perfection, I adjusted as a sudden glow surrounded her, raising her to the Minor Immersion realm. “Stop,” I called her even as I focused on the light that was diffusing from her, and the inspiration that followed. I went through the nine moves once more … and felt myself reach Minor Familiarity smoothly. </p><p>Fascinating. </p><p>Not the achievement of earning another rank. Thanks to the System, I was used to jumping multiple stages at once. However, the difference between the two was different. From the System, the information arrived in a complete form, while the inspiration gave me the strength to resolve its mysteries. </p><p>The system was still superior, of course, but there was no harm in having additional methods. Particularly since there was a limit to the techniques I could launder through Aisnam. For example, I couldn’t give her the Furious Palm of Nine Tsunami technique without making her suspicious. </p><p>Even her mysterious allies had to have some limits to stay believable. </p><p>Pearyin watched me practice with a confused expression, no doubt wondering about my display of incompetence, but she was too shy to ever take the initiative to speak about it. It gave me some time to consider how to best leverage Pearyin’s ease of breaking through. </p><p>“Follow me,” I said as I brought her to one of the hills. </p><p>Once we arrived at the hill, the first thing I did was reinforce the formation. I based the protections on what did it took to contain the breakthrough of the formation skill, and made sure to build it strong enough to contain another light effect hundreds of times stronger. </p><p>While I did so, she built another building, this time to function as a dojo. I reinforced that with multiple formations as well. </p><p>I pulled a high-grade wood plaque from my inventory and wrote one word, infusing it with my conception. </p><p>Palm. </p><p>“From now on, I want you to practice your palm techniques here,” I said. </p><p>“Should I start with the Verdant Palm, or Tsunami?” she asked. </p><p>“For the moment, just focus on Tsunami,” I said. I didn’t know what would happen when two techniques mixed, but I wanted to test it on the secret cave of Formations first. No need to waste a potentially one-time resource. </p><p>“As you wish, sir,” she said as she started practicing the technique once more, her hits devastating enough to destroy the dojo if it wasn’t for the formations even using her Qi at minimum. </p><p>Furious palm indeed. </p><p>I watched as she danced between the moves, trying to follow her patterns. Soon, another glow appeared, even more intense. Major Immersion. </p><p>I practiced under its effect, feeling my competency deepen. It wasn’t enough to bring me to Major Familiarity, but it was still impressive enough. We continued practicing, and soon, she reached the Minor Integration. </p><p>This time, the multicolored glow landed over us. I once again found myself in floating on the mysterious path that felt like a mountain and a bridge at the same time… I reached the next stage of expertise. Yet, even after the glow faded, the effect remained. It was far easier to practice palm techniques here, like I was gliding on ice. </p><p>Pearyin continued to practice, losing herself in the ecstasy of development until another, even more intense multicolored glow covered us, but this time, the path felt even more robust. I could feel that, under my feet, there was solid ground. </p><p>Pearyin continued to practice. I called her to stop, but she didn’t hear me, lost in practice. I thought about interrupting her, but she was in a state of epiphany. According to what I had learned, trying to wake someone up from epiphany was far worse than waking up a sleepwalker, with the potential to hurt them. </p><p>“Well, that would not do,” I muttered, and started building another, stronger formation, one that would keep the inevitable invasion of glow. </p><p>Just as I completed the third layer, another multicolored glow appeared, but this time, it didn’t spread. Instead, it turned into an ephemeral gate, and what followed was a path. </p><p>Pearyin took a step. </p><p>And disappeared. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“… Alright, I changed my mind about the assassins. They are not welcome anymore,” I muttered as I extracted myself from Aisnam’s arms, who had just recently fallen asleep, earlier than our usual time, because I had to focus on tiring her.</p><p>Which meant, fewer rewards. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 50; Pampering Bonus - 75 (Capped)]</p><p>[125x Return - 239 Qi Strands]</p><p>I had to do so due to the number of cultivator assassins. It was not even dawn, yet I could see eight cultivators rushing toward the capital through my detection formation, with four of them fast enough to suggest either higher cultivation near the peak of Qi Gathering or a movement art. </p><p>I hoped for a movement art. As much as my Rabbit Dash was useful, martial essence had its limits. I would much rather have a Qi-based movement art for emergencies. </p><p>My first target was the cultivator I had detected the earliest. Another early stage Qi cultivator, merely at the third stage. Based on his speed, I assumed that he was still coming from the Zaim Kingdom, but the outskirts. I wondered why he was trying. It should be obvious to him that he was late…</p><p>Not the sharpest challenger. </p><p>I summoned one of the disposable daggers from my inventory, wondering if maybe I should try something different against him. The old man, hunting the weaklings for a better payday was nice … but why not beef up that story with some extra fun. </p><p>Rather than confronting the enthusiastic assassin directly, I lay on his path for an ambush, waiting for him to approach. Once he appeared, I took a view of his looks. He was not young, but he walked confidently. </p><p>One that a mere Third Stage cultivator shouldn’t have, particularly whose skills were subpar. It suggested that it hadn’t been a long time since he had the opportunity to cultivate. </p><p>He was the perfect target for my next move. </p><p>I waited until he was nearby, and attacked him from ambush, using the Five Draws Illusionary Dagger’s first move. The Qi turned into a sharp wave, which turned into three, and rushed toward my target like a deadly specter. </p><p>He was lucky that I only aimed at his shoulder, leaving a deep wound that only prevented him from fighting effectively rather than risking his life. He reacted late, retreating against a rock. “Who are you! Show yourself, coward!” </p><p>I shook my head. Not the sharpest tool in the shed. Unlike other cultivators I faced, he seemed to lack the unofficial ethics of cultivators. Still, it worked even more to my benefit. I appeared in front of him, wearing a dark cloak that covered my face. “Leave everything you own, and I’ll let you live,” I said with a booming voice that I enhanced with my Qi. </p><p>Ostensibly, to intimidate him, but I deliberately let it echo far and wide, enough that some of the other assassins would hear, as well as many of the martial artists around. </p><p>I wanted to give them the impression that there was more than one party that decided to target the assassins rather than the target. The more they were careful, the better. </p><p>“Never!” he gasped as he leaped on top of a rock and pulled a sword. Merely a Profound artifact, too damaged to last more than three hits. I could have disabled him a dozen ways before he could succeed in his attack, but I deliberately let him complete, and chose to dodge instead. </p><p>It was a good test against an unfamiliar weapon. He was too weak and wounded to present any risk, allowing me to familiarize myself with fighting against cultivators in a </p><p>“How dare you try to rob me as a coward!” </p><p>“Because someone else robbed me. I need the spirit stones to return to the market,” I said. </p><p>“Market? What market?” he said, showing that his knowledge about cultivation was even more limited than I expected. He probably found a technique by chance. Too bad he didn’t have it with him. </p><p>Maybe I should follow him to his base. Based on his speed, it couldn’t be too far away. </p><p>I didn’t answer, instead clutched my side like I was suffering from a deep wound. While I knelt, I tagged him with a subtle formation, one that would flare periodically to give his location, but it would be activated a day later. </p><p>I wanted to visit his hiding spot if I had time. If possible, I needed another gate transformation technique. I was hoping that, once I had several of them, I could improve mine even further. </p><p>Once that was done, I moved to the next weak target. This time, he was using a saber. Once again, I sparred with him to test myself and get used to cultivator combat, while also selling the story. However, now that I knew a saber technique, even though it was a different technique, and a beginner one, the difference was incredible. </p><p>I could predict his attacks far more easily, countering and dodging them as needed. </p><p>It only improved my desire to collect more weapon techniques to improve my capabilities. Not many cultivators chose that path, as being an expert in one technique was far better than mediocre in many. </p><p>Luckily, I cheated. So, for me, the choice was between being a master of one, and a master of many. </p><p>I dealt with four other weaker cultivators the same way, but I used different weapons and techniques for each case, making the story of a robbing spree far more believable. Luckily, one of them carried a ripped book about gate transformation, supporting my mission to gather more knowledge. The technique seemed ordinary, but it didn’t matter much. </p><p> I also collected a fist technique and a sword technique in the process from the two who decided to bring their technique books with them. However, the others, I didn’t tag. They didn’t seem to be as naive as the first cultivator I dealt with, so I didn’t expect them to keep their treasures with them. </p><p>Now, only the real challenge remained. </p><p>Four strong cultivators. </p><p>Well, two of them, I corrected as I checked their locations. Two of them were already pulling back, retreating from the area, while the other two were continuing toward the capital steadily, unaffected by the fights. </p><p>I was tempted to fight against them, but I decided against it. One of them was at the eighth stage, and the other at the Ninth. And, the world of itinerant cultivators was dangerous enough that reaching that level couldn’t be done easily. Either they were smart and calculative, or they had some kind of advantage that allowed them to survive despite being reckless and stupid. </p><p>Either way, it meant they might have some dangerous trump cards that could take me down if I tried to replicate the earlier trick. </p><p>Was I confident to take them down by using formations? Certainly, but that didn’t mean I could counter every single thing they had in. Formations, particularly at my level, was an incredible source, but I needed to actually know the risks and their working principles — at least roughly — to counter them. </p><p>“But, maybe I could pull a different trick,” I muttered as I realized that, once the two had continued to approach, the routes they had picked were not too far away. It wasn’t impossible to adjust their route slightly with the application of the formations. A slight illusion here, some savage beasts with the potential to be annoying there … and soon, the two Late Stage cultivators looking at each other tensely, each trying to assess the other. </p><p>I activated a talisman I placed between them. It was just a purification talisman, with no offensive effect, but it didn’t need to. They were already tense due to the fighting that had been going around, which was the reason the other two Late Stage cultivators had retreated. </p><p>It was like throwing a firecracker at a tense meeting between two gangs with bad blood between them. </p><p>Both cultivators reacted to it by attacking. The one at the Eight Stage pulled a staff, while the one at the Ninth Stage pulled a saber, and they launched simultaneous attacks. A sharp wave of flame collided with a mist as they moved toward each other, their fight intense enough to shake the ground. </p><p>I was safe behind the formation, but that didn’t prevent me from feeling intimidated. I realized that, watching Aisnam gave me a misleading impression of the potential of the cultivators of Qi stage, mostly because Verdant Palm was a weaker technique compared to what they had been using. </p><p>I could have easily used my Verdant Palm to defeat them if my cultivation was higher, but that was about the unnatural advantages of mastery. At the same level of expertise, what they were using was certainly better. </p><p>It was probably Yellow rank rather than merely Profound. Intimidating, but also exciting about the three techniques I had received from Aisnam. </p><p>I didn’t interfere with their battle other than manipulating their perception slightly, delaying their defenses to make sure they both received some dangerous wounds. </p><p>The commotion they created, along with their losses, should be enough to keep any assassin from visiting for a while. And, as much as losing the opportunity to get easy loot was a pity, it was better for me to focus on the techniques I had already collected, and be ready for the eventual arrival. </p><p>Now, all that remained was to see whether the Verdant family would put enough bounty to tempt Foundation Realm artists, or stop instigating and rely on Tiger Fist army to finish. </p>",

While I would have preferred Tara to be a better actress, there was little I could do to change that in short order. </p><p>I asked her to lock the door rather than doing it myself, because I didn’t want to trick Daria when it came to the capabilities of Tara. Letting her underestimate us too much wouldn’t be to our benefit. </p><p>That, and if the Lady of Destruction decided to demolish our bar, that little subterfuge wouldn’t help us any. </p><p>Admittedly, Daria wasn’t any better when it came to acting. Even with everything we had done together, a spoiled party girl was supposed to react badly when she suddenly found herself locked in a seedy bar regardless of anything else we had done. Yet, she didn’t even acknowledge the possibility of the risk. </p><p>She wasn’t a bad infiltrator when she was properly briefed, but when left to her own devices, she was nowhere as impressive. The difference was stark enough that I started to get even more curious when it came to Rose, her mysterious ally and trainer. </p><p>But, that was for another time. </p><p>“So, Amelia,” I said as I teased her, deliberately using her fake name. “You want to check my cameras because you lost a personal item,” I asked, enjoying the way she nodded confidently, mostly due to the way it made her mostly-naked tits dance. Tara was still in the room, which made the moment even more erotic. </p><p>“Yes,” she said. </p><p>“Really,” I added. “And, couldn’t you come up with a better lie, sweetie,” I added, and she flinched. </p><p>“W-what do you mean, lie,” she said, tense, but not enough to throw her off her role. Normally, an inexperienced undercover agent like her would have panicked. Of course, such panic would have been about fearing for her life, which was not exactly a problem for her. </p><p>Amusingly, it worked more to my benefit rather than hers, as it allowed me to push her more without truly scaring her off. </p><p>“I mean, isn’t it obvious. You’re not that good of an actress,” I said, which made her eyes widen as something clicked in her gaze. I could see her tensing, ready to show off her power. I immediately continued, as the last thing I wanted was for her to actually reveal her power. I didn’t want her to know that her heroic identity was known. It would make things much more difficult than necessary. </p><p>“It’s clear that the local police probably saw us together, and now forcing you to be an informant for them to deal with the drug trade,” I continued in a casual, smug tone, like I was playing poker and saw her bluff. </p><p>“What?” she gasped, surprised by my conclusion. </p><p>“Actually, I would love to hear about the details. Tell me, were you actually caught with drugs, or are you silly enough to help them just as your civic duty.” </p><p>“I …” she muttered, pausing for a moment as she realized just how convenient was misunderstanding was, and choosing to believe that it was just a coincidence. </p><p>A dangerous assumption on her part. </p><p>“No need to lie, I can read you easily, sweetie,” I said as I reached forward, twisting her nipple, the familiar move working two ways. It not only distracted her from thinking too deeply but also it convinced her of the perception of the situation even more. “Now, just tell me how the useless local police managed to convince you that just coming out and asking you to see the security cameras of my excellent establishment is a good idea.” </p><p>“You mean this dump,” she answered, smirking far too confidently for a woman who was supposed to be caught as a snitch by a dangerous criminal, but considering my palm was still over her breast, it wasn’t entirely unrealistic that she didn’t feel the threat for her life. Her chastity would have been a different matter, but that ship had already sailed. </p><p>“Hey, it’s my dump you’re mocking,” I said playfully. The way I twisted her nipple was far less playful, along with her incredible moan. “But, about the situation.” </p><p>“Well, apparently there’s a federal case targeting the drug dealers, and they promised to help some of my problems go away if I could visit this place a few times and use a wire to stake the warehouse,” she said. </p><p>“I hope you’re not wearing a wire right now,” I teased her. </p><p>“Well, you can always search me and make sure,” she offered. </p><p>It was tempting, particularly since I could see the way her eyes brightened with desire as she offered. I thought about taking that offer, but I decided to listen to her excuses first. I had to admit, the federal case was a good excuse. Not something a minor villain could just wave away, but not dangerous for me either, giving her an excuse to hang around. The wire excuse was particularly good, giving her an excuse to hang around more, while also letting me know that those imaginary agents were not targeting my bar. </p><p>“Later,” I said. “Are you sure they are not targeting my bar,” I added even as I moved my hand to her hair, and suddenly pulled her closer, making sure the pain was kept within the limits of what she enjoyed. Her moan confirmed that I pulled it off. “Because, I would make you pay.” </p><p>“Pay, how?” she moaned, showing just how much she enjoyed the idea. </p><p>I smirked, enjoying the sudden stiffening of her naked nipples. “Maybe I would chain you in my basement. I’m sure the feds wouldn’t care about their slutty informant disappearing too much, and your sinful body would be enough to pay for my losses.” </p><p>“Please, I’m worth a hundred of this dump,” she declared between moans. </p><p>“Well,” I muttered as I leaned closer, about to capture her lips. “I can’t argue with that, slut. You’re worth my whole fortune,” I said as I captured her lips, deliberate in my compliment. She wanted to be treated roughly by her criminal paramour, but that didn’t mean she wanted to be treated as just another disposable whole. She clearly wanted the danger — well, the illusion of it — but also her warped version of pampering.</p><p>I was happy to give her. </p><p>“It doesn’t mean much, considering your place —” she said, only to moan as I bit her neck playfully. </p><p>“Believe me, sweetie, I’m worth much more,” I declared, deliberately pompous. “But, before talking about that, we need to make sure that you’re not wearing a wire,” I said as I gestured to Tara, who had been in the room, watching from the shadows, to walk closer slowly. </p><p>She walked silently, which was why I made a point of looking at her until Daria noticed her slow approach. As much as I wanted to set up a spicy inspection scene, I didn’t want to surprise her. </p><p>Surprising any super from what could be classified as an attack from behind was a terrible idea in principle, and that principle went tenfold when the super in question had the word Destruction in their title. And, as distracted as she was, Daria was still a hero with a lot of experience. She caught my gaze, and used the bar mirror to check behind her, noticing Tara’s steady approach. </p><p>I noticed her tense just slightly, no doubt ready to use her powers to defend herself against Tara if she decided to attack her, but it was a subtle thing. She was clearly not afraid. I smiled smugly, like I was about to pull an incredible prank. I ‘subtly’ gestured for Tara to grab Daria’s tight leather pants before speaking. “Now, let’s get rid of those leather pants. Who knows if you have a wire there…” </p><p>“Do you want me to remove them slowly like the last time —” she started, only to gasp playfully when Tara grabbed her pants. </p><p>The next gasp was far more honest when Tara pulled her leather pants, ripping them with shocking ease as she used her strength, leaving Daria in her panties, a sexy, crimson thong. “I … that…” she gasped, excited and surprised, but not shocked. Clearly, she was aware of Tara’s strength, which was not exactly a great secret considering she had publicly dismantled a power armor with her bare hands. </p><p>“Sweetie,” I said smugly. “I’m the boss here. Do you think it’s my job to pat down suspicious customers? No, that honor goes to my sexy sidekick here,” I whispered. “Now, put your hands on the bar and spread your legs, so she can examine you properly.” </p><p>Daria followed that immediately, her expression a beautiful mixture of shock and desire. </p><p></p>",

    "content": "<p>Shooting a home movie with Emily was fun, though Tara’s shy reaction was even better. I didn’t need to ask her whether she watched it, as her blush already revealed that she watched the show, and enjoyed it immensely. </p><p>Unfortunately, what followed was not as fun. As Emily modified and updated the security equipment, I shuffled through multiple disguises and installed them across the neighborhood, one that went far farther than the immediate surroundings of my bar. </p><p>It was hardly perfect coverage, but I was hoping that the combination of cameras, motion sensors, heat detectors, and many other gimmicky tools would work well enough for my purposes once they had been adjusted by Emily’s power. </p><p>Once she finished working on the devices and linked all to the security computer, I accompanied her to her home, though leaving took some effort when she was tempted to shoot another home movie and send it to Tara. Luckily, after using her power non-stop for such a long time, she was tired enough not to move. </p><p>Not that having fun with Emily was a chore, but I was on a tight schedule. I had more things before it was time to open the doors of the bar. </p><p>I didn’t want to skip the evening, even though I didn’t expect too many visitors after the earlier attack. I wanted to operate, mostly to make a point, showing the Syndicate that we were strong enough to handle a small threat like that. My hope was that they would take it as a mixture of truth and bluff — particularly with Tara’s fake wound, giving them the impression that they could use guns to take her down — which would keep them from acting immediately. </p><p>If they did, the combination of Tara and the laser cannon should be enough to handle a stronger attack, but I didn’t want to reveal those cards easily. </p><p>The reason for my hurry was related to that. With the Syndicate acting aggressively, I didn’t want to be forced to use all of my trump cards. Meaning, I needed to distract them from something else…</p><p>Luckily, I had all the necessary pieces to create a distraction. The captured tinker, the junkyard, and most importantly, Daria, also known as the Blue Princess and the Lady of Destruction. Combining all three would distract the Syndicate from me sufficiently. At a minimum, I hoped that they would change their location despite the warehouse being a good teleporter spot. Hopefully, Daria would be able to save the tinker, removing the whole reason the Syndicate had a reason to pay attention to my little bar. </p><p>And, I would attain the safety I had been searching for. </p><p>Unfortunately, while that plan was simple in theory, it was anything but so in practice. Daria was strong, but whether she was strong enough to take down both the New Giant Force guild and the Syndicate was another question. Especially since, at this point, she had no reason to suspect an official guild, and probably only suspecting the Syndicate. </p><p>So, not only did I have to alert her to the true danger, but also did so in a way that didn’t reveal my help as the first step. Then, I needed to feed her some information about the exact location of imprisonment, and, in the process, alert her about the location of the prisoner and the cooperation between the two forces. Junkyard was the best target for it, but I couldn’t do it without more information, as it was a trap. </p><p>It was why, while I had used most of the modified cameras to ensure the security of the bar, I had spared some of the best ones, particularly with good zooming, for this exact purpose. I couldn’t visit the junkyard directly without alerting them, but accessing the rooftops of some of the others was not too much of a problem. </p><p>It wasn’t the way of collecting the highest quality information, but at this point, every little bit counted. </p><p>The task of placing the cameras was very important, but exciting, it was not. All I needed was to walk into a few apartments, my power allowing me to easily pick their entry codes. From that point, I just needed to access to their roof, plug the camera like it belonged to their standard security operation, activate their upload link … and voila, another eye to my growing detection capabilities. </p><p>Once the task of setting the new security cameras was complete, I returned to the bar, once again using the security tunnel, feeling safer than ever. The fact that I had an actual security system with some automated alerts that didn’t rely on me constantly watching the cameras was a happy occasion. </p><p>“Hello, beautiful. Everything ready?” I asked Tara, who once again dressed in her usual ensemble, though she had changed her top. </p><p>“Yes, sir. Everything is cleaned, and ready to go.” </p><p>“Good,” I said. “We have just one thing before starting,” I added. She looked at me questioningly. “You’re supposed to be injured, but trying to hide it. You need to lean more to your side, and occasionally gasp when you make a sharp motion,” I added. </p><p>She tried to do what I suggested, which wasn’t particularly believable. She might be very agile thanks to her powers, but a good actress, she was not.</p><p>“Try to limp more, make your expression of pain a little less nuanced …” I started, giving her several corrections until she could move steadily. “Try not to make obvious moves, but be ready to act.” Once the acting lesson was complete, I gestured for her to sit in a different, more concealed spot. It wasn’t exactly hidden, but it would make her keep in the shadows, reducing the challenge of her acting while also selling her wounded state better. </p><p>Altogether, it was the best I could do in short order without the risk of overplaying my hand. </p><p>Once everything was ready, I opened the doors, wondering if I would even have any customers after the earlier fight. Most ordinary criminals would avoid the mess, but the question was whether I would have any other visitors. </p><p>However, when the door opened, I was met with an unexpected first visitor. </p><p>Daria. </p><p>“Hello, stranger,” she said as she strode forward, confident as she put her outfit to best use. She had chosen not to wear a skirt this time, instead choosing to wear pants. However, considering she wore leather pants that were tight enough to look like a part of her body, it wasn’t exactly a huge improvement. She wore heeled boots, a sexy set that elevated her sexiness even further. The thin tube top that showed off her lack of a bra and her leather jacket completed the combo, and her red hair looked striking. </p><p>She smirked at me as she entered. I liked her smirk. It did interesting things to her lips, and hers were already attractive. Even without the knowledge of her true identity, she was a striking example of femininity. With the truth of power that lay beneath the surface, she was a true display of femininity. </p><p>“Hello again, stranger,” she said. “Long time no see.” As she said that, she put her purse on the bar and slid up onto the stool in front of me, her whole aura seductive, this time without any attempt from me. </p><p>Thanks to my power, I could see that her arousal and desire were genuine … but that wasn’t enough to hide one fact. She was this forward, because she wanted something. </p><p>I said nothing, just smiled before I poured her another drink, enjoying the glint of her green eyes. She was beautiful. </p><p>“So, big crowd tonight,” she muttered as she leaned forward while tugging her top lower, which created a cleavage for her already deficient tank top. Her breasts were too big to be going around without a bra, not that I was complaining. </p><p>I didn’t even look at Tara, suddenly glad for Emily’s visitation earlier. My unique way of coaxing her had worked well to show that Tara had no problems with jealousy, which was a welcome development. It meant I could focus on Daria even when Tara was inside. </p><p>“Well, every business has its ups and downs,” I said. She chuckled, and we started flirting for a few minutes, while her actions getting more and more obvious. She threw a few measuring yet smug glances at Tara, who was in her seat, her biker helmet hiding her expression. </p><p>“So, I need a favor,” she said as she leaned toward me, enough that a glance down would have afforded me a view that was not just sexy, but downright erotic. </p><p>“Oh, what’s that,” I said, keeping my gaze on her eyes. </p><p>“I have lost a family heirloom when I visited the last time. I need to check your security cameras to find it,” she said. “I’ll make it worth your while,” she added as she pulled her tube top down, revealing her spectacular tits for me once more, still carrying the marks of our last time together. </p><p>I smirked as I gestured for Tara to lock the doors. Whatever message I planned to give to Syndicate wasn’t as important as her… </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Let’s start with washing your back,” I said as our bodies dipped into the refreshing water of the spring. </p><p>“You don’t need to—” she started, which died just as quickly as my fingers danced on her back, dealing with the stress of our trek. </p><p>“Nonsense. That was a difficult journey,” I said even as I dipped my hand in the water and grabbed her foot, gently pulling it onto my lap before pressing my thumb on her soles. “You deserve some pampering for your impressive performance and lack of protest.”</p><p>She deserved a reward. </p><p>“You did much better,” she murmured as she leaned back, her breasts hidden under the shimmering surface. She tried to look nonchalant, but she failed to hide the fascination hidden behind her eyes. She still enjoyed the novelty of our … closeness. </p><p>For a while, I said nothing in favor of watching Lillian’s expression change as I gently rubbed the soles of her feet. It was a beautiful sight, her naked body barely visible under the shimmering surface of the water with strands of her beautiful hair sticking to her shoulders in their wetness. </p><p>“It feels good, but my feet were hardly strained since you carried me,” she said. </p><p>“True,” I said casually while my hands climbed up her thighs, dangerously close to her entrance. “After all, you spend the whole night riding me. Your thighs deserve the attention,” I explained. </p><p>“Really-YYY!” she said, her shy response turning into a shocked moan as I caressed her entrance, making her moan. She tried to look angry when she found herself under my amused gaze, but my finger around her clit prevented her from saying anything, converting her words to moans.</p><p>“Did you say something?” I asked, not bothering to hide the amusement in my tone as she trembled under my touch once more. Her inability to answer left her frustrated, but after the stress of our latest discoveries, the release was welcome.</p><p>Seeing that she was busy biting her cheeks to hide her moans I decided not to waste too much time in foreplay, particularly since we still had a lot to do. I grabbed her waist with my other hand and pulled her onto my lap. Distracted by the pleasure, she reacted only when she landed on my lap, her back pressing against my chest, my shaft trapped between her tight asscheeks. </p><p>She responded with a moan when I caressed her entrance. My fingers sank deeper into her breast. </p><p>“You’re an excellent healer, risking your body for me,” I whispered into her ear, making her shiver. She didn’t respond verbally, but the way she leaned back and parted her legs, giving me full access to her body was enough of an answer. I let my hands roam over her body, moving back and forth freely without consequence as I pushed her arousal higher while also getting rid of all the dirt and grime our bodies collected during our desperate escape. Miraculously, she managed to keep herself from moaning, for a while, at least. </p><p>Then, I leaned forward and pressed my lips to her neck, biting her softly for a moment before my lips started to dance over her skin. In response, her hips started to dance up and down, massaging my shaft nicely. “Better,” I whispered in approval even as circled my finger around her nipple. She shivered sexily, tempting me to push forward. </p><p>I decided to tease her a bit more. </p><p>I caressed her entrance once more while her hips rocked, her tight asscheecks doing their best to imprison my shaft between them. She stayed on my lap, naked and obedient as I nibbled on her neck. </p><p>“So, tell me, Lillian, do you like this?” I said even as my fingers once again probed her entrance, making her shiver helplessly. </p><p>I liked the way she turned to face me, once again her shyness showing itself at my reminder. She knew that what she was doing was wanton and slutty, but her desires, combined with my impressive heroism prevented her from acting on that guilt. Instead, she obediently nodded, and when I leaned forward, accepted my kiss. </p><p>It was all I needed to let my fingers loose on her body mercilessly. My left hand teased her clit, again and again, even occasionally slipping inside whenever she was too distracted by my kiss. </p><p>Under my determined assault, it wasn’t shocking for her to start shivering. I captured her lips in a domineering kiss without warning, the invasion of my tongue doing wonders to dispel her drowsiness. Then, just as she was getting in the mood, I pushed her back a bit, and under her confused glare, pulled myself out of the water, and sat on the corner of the spring, my legs still in the water.</p><p>Her lack of understanding only lasted until I pointed at the massive monster between my legs, waiting for a release for too long. After everything that had happened today, I had no intention of going to sleep with blue-balls. “It’s time to pay back the favor,” I said with a smirk. </p><p>“I…” she murmured in shock, her eyes firmly locked on my shaft, no doubt trying to process just how dangerously close it was to truly ruin her. She stood up, the water barely deep enough to cover her thighs, but she didn’t bother to cover her body with her arms. </p><p>“Come on, beautiful,” I said lightly as I leaned back a bit, which only highlighted my erection further. </p><p>Her fingers were trembling as she wrapped them around the base of my shaft, her eyes widening a bit more when her fingers failed to connect. </p><p>“I’m going to…” she murmured before taking a deep breath, but continuing with a whisper that would have been impossible to hear without the changes my body was going through. “… suck you.” </p><p>“Good girl,” I said as I patted her head gently. “Then, suck it,” I said as I gently grabbed her head and gently pulled her forward until her lips pressed against my head, and my shaft trembled in excitement. </p><p>She opened her mouth obediently and moved her head forward, engulfing the tip with her warmth. She moved back and forth a bit, her eyes firmly shut. </p><p>“Good girl,” I said once more as she actually pushed herself halfway down my shaft despite a gag that escaped her mouth, and looked at me victoriously. I didn’t know what she was expecting, but seeing her watching me victoriously while trying to open her mouth as much as possible to accommodate my shaft, the site of it managed to trigger my new instincts once more, begging for me to dominate her. </p><p>This time, I was too aroused to resist. </p><p>“Good attempt,” I said as I put my hands to the back of her head, cutting off her escape route. “But now we’re going to do the real thing. Open your mouth as much as possible, and relax,” I ordered, unlike the other times, my tone neither calm nor mocking. Instead, a deep rumble escaped my mouth, more animal than human, something I didn’t know I was capable of. </p><p>Lillian trembled. </p><p>She trembled, but it wasn’t fear I saw flaring in her eyes for a moment before she firmly shut them and swallowed my shaft. Instead, it was submission, triggered by my primal tone. That expression destroyed the last of my restraint, and I pushed deep into her throat, her gags echoing in the cave. </p><p>I should keep my instincts back, but it was hard, even with the sudden increase in mana generation.</p><p>Her determination to keep her eyes closed didn’t last long when I pushed deeper into her throat, widening in shock to reveal her beautiful eyes in a novel expression. I ignored her failure to breathe, and slowly pushed deeper in her throat, her throat wrapping around me nicely even as a bulge appeared. </p><p>“Letting my new instincts win was obviously dangerous, but seeing Lillian’s pouty lips around the base of my shaft while she struggled to breathe was not something that helped me control my desire. My instincts took control as I moved forward a bit, enough for my feet to press on the bottom of the spring before cutting loose, drilling into her throat mercilessly. </p><p>Then, without a warning, I pulled back, leaving her gasping and coughing helplessly. “That was…” she managed to say between her attempts to breathe. “… Fun,” she continued a moment later.</p><p>”Excellent,” I said as I repeated the position, until I exploded into her mouth, pushing the excess mana alongside as she desperately tried to catch all. </p><p>My condition might be dangerous, but the medicine was incredible… </p>",
