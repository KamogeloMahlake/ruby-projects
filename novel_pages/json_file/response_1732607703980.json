    "content": "“What do you mean Thomas is gone,” Sarah asked. <p>“It’s very simple, honey,” Erik answered. “Your husband was very enthusiastic about validating the agreement and departed to visit his company lawyer. After all, what’s the harm leaving his wife alone with his new business partner, right?”</p><p>Sarah would have liked to say Thomas wouldn’t leave without even bothering to send a message, but it would be a lie. With the recent threat of bankruptcy, the company had started to take more and more of his attention. The fact that he had decided to leave her with Erik without a warning was eerily believable. But just because he left her there didn’t mean she had to stay there, she decided. She stood up. </p><p>“Sit down,” Erik ordered. It wasn’t that his voice was loud. It was barely above a whisper, yet under his sharp gaze and slight frown, Sarah found her legs following the command without consulting her brain first. “Good,” he continued. “You still haven’t had your dessert.” </p><p>She stood frozen, wordless, a state of affairs that started to become disturbingly common. She tried to come up with something to say, but before she could construct one, the waiter came, carrying a tray of dessert. “Panna cotta for the lady,” Erik said, and the waiter turned to her and lowered the plate. His hand was a bit shaky, and it made contact with the table harder than necessary. Not surprising, Sarah thought as her arms rose reflexively, trying to cover up the cleavage the waiter was so busy looking into. But she saw Erik shaking his head subtly, and her arms fell onto the table once more, leaving a clear display for the waiter to enjoy despite the burning feeling on her skin. </p><p>The waiter went away, though only after spending several seconds more than necessary loitering around the table, filling himself with the view she was providing. But his absence did little to calm Sarah. Erik continued to loom over at the other side of the table. His gaze fell on her dessert, and she found herself raising the spoon, the sugary smell filling her nose. “How is the dessert,” he asked casually a few seconds later like everything was completely normal. </p><p>“It’s okay,” Sarah found herself saying. </p><p>He looked like he was about to answer, but his hand brushed his fork, and it fell on the ground. “How clumsy of me,” Erik said. “Sarah, be a dear and pick it up, would you.” </p><p>Sarah was about to tell him just to call a waiter to bring a new one when his smile twisted wider, and she heard the sound of a fork dragging on the floor. She looked at him incredulously, realizing it was not an accident but a deliberate move to make her go under the table. What awaited her under the table, she had no trouble imagining. She opened her mouth, about to reject his ridiculous proposition when he locked her into his gaze, with steel behind. </p><p>Her words aborted, she sneaked under the table after a glance making sure no one was around to observe it, thanking the gods for the relatively isolated location of the table, and even more importantly, the tablecloth was long enough to touch the floor. Concealed under the thick white fabric, there was barely enough light to see the silhouettes of the objects. But that was a nascent comfort when his shaft stood tall and intimidating, wrapped in a hulking darkness. Sooner she started, sooner she could finish the ridiculous suffering she was under. </p><p>She reached, wrapping her fingers around his shaft, her fingers failing to touch as she did her best to envelop his girth. Her hand started to move up and down as his shaft throbbed against her skin. “Good start,” she heard him saying. “But don’t dally too much before starting to eat your dessert.” She didn’t want his taste in her mouth once more, not after she spent most of the night trying to forget it. And more importantly, she found it was much easier to defy him when she wasn’t overwhelmed under his sharp gaze. She continued pumping him for a while, hoping that he would climax, but minutes passed with no result. </p><p>Not willing to take him into her mouth, she decided it was enough, and sneaked out of the table, though her earlier determination took a fatal damage as soon as she met his iron gaze, capturing her as soon as she pushed her head above the table. She froze for a moment, waiting for a command she felt she was about to receive. She knew that, at that point, she lacked the willpower to reject any command, no matter how degrading. A command that failed to arrive, much to her shock. With trembling legs, she managed to push herself back to her seat, remembering to check her surroundings only after her ass made a contact with the seat. </p><p>“Are you enjoying your dessert,” he asked with a casual tone, contrasting with the fire that burned in his eyes. Unable to find the willpower to actually form the words, she refrained from answering, just nodding instead. “Good,” he added. “At least you can enjoy a nice moment before we move to your punishment.” </p><p>“Punishment,” she repeated in shock. She should have felt pure outrage at the suggestion that she was responsible for following his orders to the extent that failure required restitution, but the shock seemed the limit she was able to gather. </p><p>“Yes, punishment,” he repeated in a confident smirk. “But since you were timorous enough to talk back, I should start now. Give me your panties.” </p><p>She couldn’t do anything but look at him in a total shock, or at least her conscious mind did. Only after she felt a sudden drift under her skirt that she realized her hands already capitulated to his demands before her mental approval, pulling down her panties. Helpless, she rose in her seat a bit, enough to allow her panties to slide down her legs. The distinct click of a phone taking a photo didn’t exactly make things better, especially when one of his hands were under the table, leaving no doubt about the scene he just immortalized. Still, she was already helpless, and a couple of photos weren’t likely to ruin her life any worse than the material he already possessed. </p><p>Her fingers were trembling badly as she pushed her fist forward, a bunched up underwear hidden in her fist. At least, she escaped the humiliation of being caught as she passed her underwear to a man in a public setting. He smiled as she dropped the bundle in his hands, but she was happy to note that he put it in his pocket instead of unfolding to check, advertising the circumstances of their lunch to other visitors. “Good,” he murmured in good humor, causing her annoyance to rise, but it was targeted more to her sudden satisfaction rather than his words. </p><p>Their lunch fell into a silent flow, broken by the occasional visit by the waiter to check whether they had any other request, far too often than they should. Sarah would’ve assumed it was because of Erik’s relative standing in the restaurant, but the waiter’s gaze that stayed stuck at her cleavage at each visit told a different tale. Even worse, the waiter ignored the obvious signs of her discomfort after receiving a subtle nod from Erik. His chuckle at her begging gaze after the waiter left for the first time told her in no uncertain terms that it was a part of her punishment. </p><p>She couldn’t help but feel elated when she saw Erik gesturing the waiter to bring the check. The sign that her public torture was about to come to an end brought a smile to her face, one even the waiter’s hungry gaze unable to erase. She said nothing as he paid the check, though her eyes grew a bit when she saw the size of the tip he left, another sign of his wealth. “Shall we,” he said as he stood up, presenting his arm to her. She would’ve liked to ignore his arm, but there was a tightness in his smile, telling her that she wouldn’t enjoy the consequences. </p><p>She placed her arm on his arm, ready to go. “Ups, I almost forgot to leave the tip,” he said, reaching for the check. She was about to remind him that he already handled it, when she realized he wasn’t holding cash in his hand. She felt a burning sensation of shame invading her body as he left her panties on top of the check, and the smirk of the waiter didn’t help any. He started walking without uttering another word, and she followed, a sinking feeling in her stomach as she did her best to ignore what the waiter was going to do with her panties later on. </p><p>She felt naked as they traversed the restaurant, each step carefully to keep her skirt from flaring. Her skin crawled as every eye tracked her movement. She would like to discount the feeling as paranoia, but with the absence of her bra, her blouse failed the task of covering her breasts, a generous silhouette on display for every wandering eye, not made better by the strong afternoon sun shining behind her. The only detail that could be construed as positive was the lack of familiar faces. The last thing she needed was to explain why she was dining with a man other than her husband, in a dress that would fit perfectly for a sorority party. </p><p>“Here are your keys,” the valet came to them the instant they stepped outside the restaurant. She understood the reason for his excitement in the form of a hundred-dollar bill, hidden in Erik’s palm which transferred to the valet in a firm handshake. Still, she felt sympathetic to him, as he wasn’t doing his best trying to memorize every detail of her cleavage like the earlier waiter. </p><p>They took a few steps forward, her eyes looking for the car he used for yesterday’s visit, but she was unable to find it. Instead, he led her towards another car, this one a high-end sports car with a distinctive green paint. “How many cars do you have?” she asked before her brain could fully engage. </p><p>“Enough,” he answered as he continued towards the car. Focused on the car, and the extent of his wealth if he had multiple cars of that level, she failed to notice the movement of his hand until too late. Only after she felt a distinct sense of chill on her bottom, she realized the absence of the comforting feeling of the fabric rubbing against her skin. With a panicked yelp, her hand found her skirt and pushed down, covering her bottom once more, though the errant glance she sent backward showed her that valet was observing her steps with a dazed interest. </p><p>Ashamed, confused, and helpless, she put no resistance as he opened the door and led her towards the passenger seat before taking the driver’s seat himself. He pressed the gas, and the distinctive rumble of a sports car reverberated across her body as they sped away. Despite everything, she felt excitement spreading through her body under the sudden acceleration. </p><p>Her attention divided between the sudden thrill of the ride and the utter humiliation she had experienced moments ago, it took a while for her to gather herself to speak. “What the hell was-” she exclaimed, only to cut like a knife as he turned towards her, holding her under the sharp gaze that was starting to get disturbingly familiar. </p><p>“We can keep your mouth better occupied if you have enough energy to speak,” he spoke as his fingers found his zipper, and released his shaft. </p><p>She would have liked to claim that she had resisted his ridiculous proposal, or at least resisted until he had brought up the blackmail video that was in his possession. Unfortunately, both would be inaccurate. The delay between his order and her lips wrapping around his erection was negligible, and only after she bobbed her head several times she even remembered the existence of the blackmail video. But before she could think on the implication of her sudden obedience, she felt a hand over her head, and the sudden pressure pushed his shaft deeper into her throat in a scene that was disturbingly similar. </p><p>There was a silver lining, a part of her mind recorded morbidly. At least she wasn’t trying to keep her voice low as he mercilessly invaded her throat, afraid of alerting her husband. A sudden wave of guilt welled up inside her as she realized that she was recording her ability to cheat her husband with no risk of getting caught, the reasons for it suddenly paling in consequence. She would’ve liked to pull away, but the pressure of his hand didn’t allow it, and she lacked the confidence to push for it. </p><p>Then, she felt the pressure that locked her to the position disappear, and she heard the glove compartment opening and closing. Instead of trying to guess what he removed from there, however, she was busy assessing relative advantages of pulling back versus continuing her horrible task. On the one hand, she would be escaping the humiliating position she was suffering, and on the other hand, she would be inviting an even worse punishment for her resistance. </p><p>However, a realization pushed both options to the background. She was aroused. A fresh wave of guilt was ready to accompany the realization, tainting her heart. It was ridiculous, she would have shouted if her mouth wasn’t busy with another task. She couldn’t feel aroused under the hands of her blackmailer, regardless of the eroticism of the situation, or the impressive ravings of the engine she felt across her body. It was simply impossible. </p><p>Confused, she almost welcomed the weird noise that reached her ears. A familiar one that she managed to identify as scissors, but in her dazed state, she failed to consider why exactly he was using it for until she felt the distinct chill of air condition on her back, unbroken by the fabric of her blouse. But before she could react, his fingers grabbed her blouse and pulled away, leaving her breasts fully naked as well. </p><p>This time, she felt an outrage spreading through her chest, annoyed that he was playing her like a toy. That would be enough to cause her to pull away, but once again, he proved the superiority of his reflexes, preventing her escape by pressing his hand on her head, pushing her even deeper. The higher level thoughts escaped her mouth as she focused on more primal needs such as breathing, a simple task impeded by his shaft invading her throat. </p><p>She gagged, she wheezed, she begged… Also, she occasionally breathed when he was generous enough to reduce the pressure, allowing her to get enough air to keep her conscious, but not enough to dispel the drunk sensation that filled her mind. He pushed into her throat countless time until she felt a sudden shot of liquid filling her mouth. “Don’t you dare to spit,” a familiar voice ordered. In a haze, she did her best to follow the order, swallowing the load to the best of her ability, her hands rising to her chin to catch the excess. </p><p>A few seconds passed until she noticed the overwhelming sound of the engine was absent for a while. “Welcome home,” he said with a drawling voice, and suddenly, she realized she was in front of her house, naked other than a skimpy skirt, her chin covered with cum. And to make things even worse, her arousal was sliding down her legs, the remainder of two orgasms she experienced during the drive. She would’ve liked to slap him for putting her in such a horrible situation, but she had much more important concerns, such as whether she was seen by a neighbor. The driveway was relatively obscured by the trees and hedges, but that wasn’t enough to give a total cover. She said nothing, just opened the door and dashed out to the door, praying that her husband wasn’t at home yet. </p><p>Explaining her current state was an impossible task. </p>",

    "content": "Several hours passed as I went over through the spoils of the latest session, with satisfactory results for the client. And more importantly, for me, I added as I examined the pictures, blown up for maximum effect, revealing my landlady’s delicious skin under the insufficient cover of the string bikini I had tricked her to wear. It was simply marvelous. <p>I could spend hours examining those pictures, but unfortunately, I had other things to do, such as food shopping. I quickly changed, my body stiff after sitting for hours in front of the computer, on an uncomfortable chair. I needed to but a decent chair, I murmured as I climbed the stairs. </p><p>I wasn’t planning to dally around the house unless Nicole was around, but the view I met at the entrance changed my mind. Katie was alone, sitting on the kitchen table, looking stressed. The shopping wasn’t as critical building up a rapport with her, I decided, walking towards her. “Hey, Katie,” I said, trying to sound concerned. “Are you okay?” </p><p>Lost in her thoughts, she hadn’t noticed my presence until I spoke. A jolt of panic passed over her face, her head turning towards me with an abject expression of panic, one that melt after she got a good look of my face. “You scared me,” she murmured, her breathing still quick as she tried to reign her adrenaline. </p><p>“Sorry, I didn’t realize you would be troubled enough to ignore my approach. I’m not easy to miss, after all.” </p><p>A chuckle escaped her mouth. “You certainly aren’t,” she said. </p><p>“So, are you going to tell me the reason you seem lost?” I added. </p><p>“It’s nothing,” she murmured, trying to brush it off. With her sad expression and her wistful tone, the statement was hardly convincing. </p><p>“It’s obvious that it’s not the case. Why don’t you tell me? Maybe I can help,” I answered as I sat on the table, looking down on her. People usually missed the importance of relative positioning, but perching over someone gave a position of dominance that was hard to ignore. It wasn’t an absolute advantage, of course, but when supported by appropriate mannerism, it worked perfectly, especially against a young and impressionable woman like her. </p><p>She continued to look closed until I leaned forward a bit more, brushing my fingers gently on her shoulder. That proved to be the key that unlocked her concerns. “I did something really stupid,” she wailed. </p><p>A nineteen-years-old woman doing something stupid, truly a disaster that hadn’t seen before. Unfortunately, needling her would be counterproductive, so I went with the kinder option. “Come on, I’m sure it’s not as bad as it sounds.” </p><p>“I told Madison that I have a boyfriend!” she said, an expression of total despair, but the reason of it avoided me completely. </p><p>“And this is bad, because…” I trailed. </p><p>“It’s horrible, because I don’t have a boyfriend, and she invited me to a group date!” </p><p>“It seems that I’m missing some subtext, why don’t you calm down and explain it from scratch. Who is this Madison, and why do you care about her enough to panic.” </p><p>“She is the lead cheerleader of the school. We used to be best friends, but then she got in the cheerleading team, and we drifted apart. However, today she was talking about how I wasn't ever going to have a boyfriend because I was a nerd, something snapped in me and I said I already have a boyfriend. But she knows I'm lying, so she invited me to a group date.” Another wail escaped her mouth. “I'm going to be humiliated.”</p><p>“That was it?” I said. She turned towards me in a display of wholehearted anger only a young woman who thought her valid suffering being trivialized could summon. I raised my hand in surrender. “Sorry, it's just that the solution is very simple. Why don't I just play your boyfriend.”</p><p>“You would do that for me?” Katie said with a total shock, followed by a tight hug. “Thank you,” she whispered repeatedly, her arms tight around my chest, but my attention was more on her breasts, pressing to my chest, showing that they were quite impressive, something I had missed due to her loose t-shirts. She let me go a few seconds later, her face burning bright, just realizing what she did, but I just smiled softly, not wanting to discourage her from initiating contact. “Can you be ready in fifteen minutes,” she said as she dashed upstairs to prepare, not even waiting for my answer. </p><p>I walked down to change, my shopping trip delayed once again. A quick shower later, I was standing in the entrance, dressed in a black t-shirt and jeans. I didn’t want to stand out too much. Katie didn’t keep me waiting for too long, appearing at the top of the stairs a minute later. I whistled appreciatively, making her blush. She deserved it though. She was wearing a skirt that passed the middle of her thighs, revealing her thin yet fit legs, and a blouse that wrapped her tighter than her usual clothes. They were far from able to bring her full potential, which made me wish to take her shopping to wrap like a present, but unfortunately, it was not possible at the current point of time. “Ready?” I asked instead. </p><p>She nodded, her face intensifying its reddish tone under my attention. It was clear that she wasn't used to attention with her beauty hidden behind her nerdy appearance, making it far easier to penetrate her defences. Easy enough dissuade me from my nefarious objectives if I was a nicer person. Unfortunately for her, I was not.</p><p>“Let’s go, then,” I murmured, presenting my arm to her, which she looked in surprise. “It would look suspicious if you look too uncomfortable with my touch,” I explained, which was technically correct, yet it didn't represent the reality. I wanted her to get used to physical contact. It would make the next step much easier.</p><p>Unaware of my nefarious reasoning, her hand gently pressed to my arm, a shy smile adorning her face. I didn't say anything, knowing the silence would affect her much stronger than any word I could come up with. </p><p>The silence lasted until we arrived at my car. “Milady,” I said with an intentionally overdone show of respect as I opened the passenger side door for her. </p><p>“Thank you kind sir,” she answered, followed by a giggle. She sat, and I walked to the drivers side. I started driving. </p><p>“So, how did we met?” I asked her after a brief discussion about our destination. </p><p>“What do you mean?” she asked, her confusion clear. </p><p>“I mean, when did I met you, when did we start dating at first, where was our first date…” I snorted. “These are some of the most common questions for a new couple. If we don’t have an answer, it would be definitely suspicious.” </p><p>“I didn’t think of it,” she said before stilling for a while. “I got it. We were in a French Fusion cooking class, and you came the class late, and the only place was next to me. Then, our hands touched and-” she went on, only to be cut by a chuckle. </p><p>“Hold your horses, honey,” I cut her. “It’s all well and good, but it’s too interesting. Such a story will induce them to ask questions, and you never know which extra question could unravel the whole story.” </p><p>“Sorry,” she said, trying to get smaller in her seat in an effort to disappear. An interestingly exaggerated response being called for a small mistake, I noted with interest.</p><p>“There is nothing to be sorry about, everybody misses things from time to time. But for now, let’s focus on crafting a small but robust story. How about if we met in a cafe. You saw the book I was reading, felt curious, and asked a question. We started talking, I invited you to join me, we talked for a couple of hours. Before leaving, I asked for your number. Two days later, I asked you for a date as well.”</p><p>“It sounds so mundane…” </p><p>“Mundane is good, makes it much less suspicious. Most people tries to embellish their lies in a way that puts them in the best possible light, making easier to catch them.” </p><p>She nodded, looking bummed. “I understand. What about the first date, then?” We were barely able to craft a coherent story at the remaining duration of the journey, a task that hadn’t been helped by her desire to embellish the story, trying to make it a romantic comedy. </p><p>“We’re here,” I said as I parked the car. “Are you ready?” She nodded, though it wasn’t exactly convincing with her panicked expression and her quickened breathing. “Perfect, let’s go then,” I said, knowing that sitting down and talking would only make her to focus on details, which was going to make her panic. Still, I wasn’t too concerned with her excitement, which could be easily disguised as teenage love. </p><p>We started walking, and I took a hold of her hand. She looked startled. “You need to be more relaxed about casual physical contact,” I warned her. “Reacting with panic when I touch you could give the game away.” </p><p>“Sorry.” </p><p>“As I told you before, there’s nothing to be sorry about, we just need you to get used to it.” With that, I raised my finger, raising it towards her cheek. She froze like a cornered rabbit, tracking my fingers with her eyes, but I didn’t let it dissuade me. It would be useful her to get used to my touch to sell the ruse. It was her unluckiness that I had other, more sinister objectives down the line. I pressed my finger on her cheek softly, dragging to the side, tracing her lips. Her mouth opened in reflex, betraying an underlying attraction. </p><p>I said nothing, just let my finger drop to her neck, dancing at the rhythm of her shivers, then pulled back. “Let’s go,” I said, wrapping my hand around hers once more, her heartbeat much stronger this time. No answer came, and we walked towards the restaurant we were supposed to meet, an Italian restaurant that could be deemed fine dining if one squinted hard enough. Still, well-outside the range of regular high school students. Probably another subtle bullying from Madison’s part, who likely knew about Nicole’s economic hardship. Still, I couldn’t help but annoyed with her, as bullies weren’t my favorite people. </p><p>As long as they didn’t look like that, I corrected myself as we entered to the restaurant, and a red-haired beauty waved to us, calling Katie by her name. She was exquisite, perfect body, adorned by long, straight red hair. And she dressed to put her assets to the maximum effect, a non-existent skirt black skirt, complimented by a white shirt that left her stomach bare, both her toned legs and flat stomach betraying the long hours she had put to practice. I had a sinking suspicion that she had dressed like that to overshadow Katie, or maybe even humiliate her by stealing her boyfriend. </p><p>Too bad for her that I was a photographer, and had sufficient exposure to perfect female bodies for them to lose their shock value. I still enjoyed them immensely of course, but in a way that a gourmet enjoyed his food. Slowly, teasingly, and always with my own terms. Madison’s little game was transparent from the first second, with the suggestive glance she threw to me, far too innocent to ever to be real. Still, I had to give her props. The plan was simple, but worked to her strengths, and had been likely to work. It was her unluckiness that she ran against me. </p><p>“Hello, I’m Madison,” she gasped, stepping closer than necessary for a handshake, her chest pushed strategically to maximize the effect of her cleavage. I kept my gaze steadfastly on her eyes, amused with the frustration at the lack of success. She must have been used to success, manipulating her way through the schoolyard. </p><p>“Stephen,” I answered succinctly before turning to her date, who didn’t look exactly thrilled with her display of enthusiasm. Still, he gave no outward reaction as we repeated the ritual of greeting. I guessed he was afraid of dissatisfying his date. Big mistake, I thought. Girls like Madison seldom reacted positively to submissive attempts to satisfy them. </p><p>I stepped to Katie’s side and pulled her chair, allowing her to sit before I moved to my own seat. “Thanks, honey,” Katie murmured, the word of endearment that escaped her mouth shaky and forced. </p><p>“Not a problem, sweetheart,” I answered, reaching across the table to caress her hand, mostly to tease her, though it helped to sell our ruse. This time, she managed not to act like my hand was made of hot steel. “I hope we didn’t kept you waiting for too long, guys,” I asked, deliberately turning to Madison’s date instead of her. A flash of anger passed through her face at being ignored, but it failed to do anything other than amuse me. </p><p>With that, the dinner commenced, though it was more of a late lunch considering it was still quite early. I let the discussion slow around me, deflecting it away to Madison’s date whenever she tried to bring it to me, other than answering the basic questions about how I met Katie. Her own date had been quite helpful in that regard. Like all football players, he was more than willing to talk about his latest heroic actions that snatched the victory from the jaws of defeat, obvious of Madison’s artful attempts to silence him. I used that time to subtly pamper Katie, a touch here, a caress there, occasionally broken by a joke whispered into her ear that left her giggling in shy amusement. </p><p>Madison’s anger was hard to hide when the dinner came to an end, though her date, true to every stereotype about football players, somehow managed to miss it. Her anger wasn’t helped when I stood up and disappear when there was the time to pay the check. She looked victorious at first, obviously assuming I was trying to skip the pay. But her anger returned with interest when I returned and told them we could go. In a monumental display of stupidity, her date thanked me with an obvious relief, decorating Madison’s anger with burning cherries. </p><p>“Guys, we are going to check this shop,” I said, pointing at the first shop to the right, pulling Katie with me. I wanted to give the guy some space to be dumped in dignity. “So,” I said after Madison and her unlucky date disappeared from the view. “What do you think?” </p><p>The answer came in the form of a tight hug, locking my arms before I could pull them out. “Thank you…” she whispered repeatedly. “It was amazing to see her face red with anger, not getting her way for once.” </p><p>“It was a pleasure,” I answered, pulling my arms out of their impromptu prison when she her grip loosened, only to wrap around her, patting her back slightly before I wrapped my arms around her, sliding towards the small of her back, but not any further, not wanting to make her aware of my real intentions. “So,” I added a minute later with a chuckle. “Do you want to step out, or would you like to do some shopping first.” </p><p>She looked around, only to blush immensely, realizing that we were in a lingerie shop. She ducked her burning face down, trying to bury herself in a vain attempt to hide. I chuckled and led her outside. “Thank you,” she whispered once again. </p><p>“You’re welcome, but don’t let yourself relax, the game is not over yet.”</p><p>“What do you mean?” she asked curiously. “Do you think Madison is going to come back?” </p><p>“I know she is,” I added. “I know her type, accepting their defeat graciously is not something they are capable of. I’m willing to bet that she is going to find us in a few minutes, telling us a tale about how her boyfriend had an emergency call, and whether we could drop her off home.” </p><p>“I don’t think so,” Katie answered. “That’s too much even for Madison.” </p><p>“What’s the forfeit, if you’re feeling that confident.” </p><p>“I do your laundry for a week,” she answered cheekily. </p><p>“It’s a bit boring for my taste. Instead, why don’t we say that you’re going to follow my lead handling this Madison situation. I can still do your chores by he off-chance of your victory.” </p><p>“Deal,” she answered cheekily, sure of her victory, and we walked through the corridors of the mall, window-shopping. Until it was interrupted by the appearance of Madison, of course. </p><p>“Sorry guys, Brad had a last minute emergency and he had to leave early. Is it possible for you to drop me off to home Stephen. Mine is not that far away from Katie’s.” However, the details of her appearance made it even more interesting. She had a fresh make-up on, but that wasn’t as interesting as her lack of a bra. I had to give it to her, her persistence was impressive. </p><p>Katie’s mouth opened, her face flickering in anger first time for the evening, but a gaze was enough to silence her. “I don’t think it would be a bother, don’t you think so, honey.” </p><p>“Really,” Madison said in a forced display of joy. “Thanks, Katie, you’re a doll as always.” </p><p>Katie looked like she was about change her mind, but I squeezed her hand gently, reminding her about the bet she just lost. “Sure,” she said, though her dissatisfaction was obvious. “It would be a pleasure.” </p><p>We walked in the car, between their pointless bickering, only their beauty allowing me to listen their nonsensical arguments about school work and extracurricular activities. When we arrived at the car, Madison looked wistfully to the front seat, considering whether she could get away by sitting there without arousing Katie’s ire, but Katie walked past her to took the seat.</p><p>“Aren’t you going to open my door, Stephen,” she said, with a fluttering smile, trying to display her bust to the maximum effect. </p><p>“You have hands, don’t you,” I answered, but this time, I let a teasing smile appear on my face, painting my rejection in a playful tone rather than my earlier dismissiveness. A fact she was aware of, if the mixture of satisfaction and frustration was any indicator. Satisfaction because she was finally making some inroads with her objective, frustration because she had a long way ahead of her. Yet, she decided a small reward was in order. She opened the door and stepped inside the car, however, it was a careless step, letting her skirt flutter freely, providing me with an arousing glance that informed me about her choice of underwear, a lacy, red piece that looked eerily transparent. </p><p>It was hard to keep the smile off my face as I walked around the car. Luckily, it was not something that was critical. Yes, it might make Katie a bit annoyed with me, but that required for her to understand the reason in the first place. I took the driver’s seat and started the car, and soon, we were at the road. “So, Madison, where exactly is your house?” </p><p>“Mine is a bit farther than Katie’s house, but it would make you drive the same road twice. I think it was easier for you to drop Katie first.” </p><p>I didn’t know what she normally expected from a statement like that, but luckily for her, it worked into my plans completely. Katie didn’t look happy, but a glance from me was enough for her to understand. Smart girl. “I suppose,” Katie answered with a perfectly exasperated voice. “It would be unfair for my boyfriend to suffer just because you had a shitty date.” </p><p>The flash of anger on Madison’s face was a sight to see, but she managed to suppress it in a few seconds. It wasn’t gone entirely, the traces of fury was still dancing on her face, but a good attempt. Madison followed with another unkind comment, which Katie countered, and soon, their bickering start once again. Pointless, I would have deemed, especially with Katie proving she had a really mean tongue when needed, but the path Madison chose to get revenge was equally interesting. She was sitting behind Katie, who couldn’t see her reflection from the angle. Same thing didn’t apply to me however, so I had been treated to a long, lingering view of her as she parted her legs once more. </p><p>Then, we were at my new residence. “It was a fun outing,” Katie said before making a slight gesture towards Madison. “Despite some unexpected irritants,” she added. “Anyway, call me when you arrive home.” </p><p>“Let me walk you to the door,” I answered and left the car, driven by my ulterior motives as usual. The house had several bushes and trees around it, enough to obscure the pathway from the curious eyes of neighbors, but Madison could still see us in front of the door. It provided me with a unique opportunity, an opportunity that I had no intention of missing. “So, how was it,” I whispered as we closed on the door. </p><p>“It was amazing, thank you very much. She went absolutely crazy,” she said, her face flush with excitement, unable to keep her eyes on me, lost in the effect of the date. She stopped, her expression turning worried. “Be careful with her though, she might get a bit extreme to get even.” </p><p>“Then, it’s better if we show her just how deep is our relationship, right?” I said. She raised her head, her eyes wide, realizing what I was about to do, but it was too late. My lips were already hovering just an inch away from hers, and with her back pressing against the door, she had nowhere to pull back. Her lips parted in an expression of alarm, but my lips were already on hers before she could utter a word. </p><p>She stiffened in surprise, but I didn’t let that deter me, knowing a second’s focused attention was all that needed to plow through her reticence. My lips danced over hers, trying to coax her to join my dance. The first verse passed alone, but for the second, she joined, her movements unsure, trembling, but nevertheless participating. My arms around her waist tightened, pulling her tight across my body, feeling her out of control heartbeat on my skin. </p><p>When I pulled back, I met in a view that was enough to convince she was drunk if I hadn’t been with her for the whole evening to see she hadn’t had a drop of it. “My first kiss,” she murmured in a haze, illuminating the reason of her shock. My smile turned up in intensity, excited to see that she was even more naive when it came to touch of a man. It would be an absolute delight to train her. </p><p>I let my hand slid down from her waist until my hand were resting on her ass, caressing gently. I was tempted to sank them deep as I leaned for another kiss, but that would push her too far too quick, risking to destroy all the progress I had made. “It’s time for you to go inside,” I said. Still in the haze of her shock, she had no will to reject. She turned obediently and opened the door. Still, I didn’t let her go inside without one last molestation, a playful spank landing on her bottom as she was closing the door. The expression of shock, tainted by a measure of outrage, was delicious to watch. </p><p>The door slammed shut, and I walked back to the car. Madison was sitting on the front passenger seat, not missing the opportunity to increase the intimacy of the rest of the journey. Moreover, I could see that her shirt was carefully folded a couple times to make it even smaller, turning it into something little better than a special event variety bra. My tongue darted out, trying to moisten my drying lips. It was nice to have confirmation that her efforts to sabotage her rival’s relationship was going to continue in her absence. Though it wasn’t going to end like she hoped, because Katie was away, allowing me to bring the full range of my abilities into the game. She was in for an interesting surprise. </p><p>I sat on the driver’s seat once more, struggling to hold back a comment about jealousy, but it was hard. Her expression, clouded in fury after the sight at the doorway was a sight to see. I couldn’t even begin to guess the reason of the weird rivalry between them, not that it stopped me from abusing it though. “So, miss cheerleader, where do we go?” </p><p>She described the route, but it was hard to pay attention due to the way she leaned forward as she explained, her cleavage revealing top of her breasts, and the bottom hidden only for a loose interpretation of the word as the shirt stuck to it. Still, I hadn’t said anything, just drove the direction she described. </p><p>“So, what exactly made you attracted to Katie. She is one of my best friends, but you had to admit that she is a bit plain,” she said, her hand, slowly climbing up her leg in a way that made me to stop the car and ravage her in the middle of the road, leaving no doubt about the meaning she packed to the word plain. </p><p>“She has a spark,” I answered. “There is something unique in her, one that calls to you.” The annoyance on Madison’s face was hilarious. She was just too easy to play. At that age, every girl had the absolute belief that only they were unique in a sea of conformist. Losing that title must have annoyed her. </p><p>“Really,” she said as she casually reached for her phone. Too casually to be anything else than an attempt of distraction. So, naturally I watched her carefully from the corner of my eye, only to see an unfamiliar application flash on her screen. But it wasn’t hard to understand its function, with a big, red, and familiar record button shining in the middle. Clever girl, but not clever enough, I noted as she placed the phone between us. It would have worked much better if she had done it as I said my farewells to Katie, or kept the phone away from my hand. </p><p>I waited until she looked outside, then carefully reached the phone, pressing to the power button, triggering a reset that would close all applications, including her voice recording app, all without making her aware. Then, I reached and put my hand over her leg, resting there gently. “Interesting accident, maybe you should be careful,” Madison said, but her expression victorious, happy that she was finally having some results. </p><p>“What accident,” I have answered as I let my hand climb higher dancing at the edge of her short skirt. </p><p>“Oh really,” she answered. I said nothing in return, just pulled to the car to the side, leveraging the fact that we were currently traveling through a deserted opening with no car on sight. I let my seatbelt free, pushed the seat maximum to the back, and turned towards her, my hand still on her leg. I slid it further, pushing it under her skirt. “Why is your hand under my skirt, Stephen,” she asked explicitly, playing for the recording that didn’t exist anymore. </p><p>“You had been a restless bitch all day, my slutty cheerleader,” I answered as my hand slid inside her panties, her eyes growing in shock. “You didn’t think that you were going get away scott free after teasing me all day long, right?” With that, my fingers found her clit, twisting around, earning a cry of pleasure off her. It was loud and exaggerated, clearly playing for the recording, but I didn’t let it discourage me, intending to turn them into real in a few minutes. </p><p>“Yes, Stephen, slide your fingers into my pussy,” she exclaimed, trying to leave no doubt about what was going on. Of course, I was more than willing to leverage it. </p><p>“As you wish, slut,” I answered and two of my fingers slid inside her tunnel. I didn’t spend any time probing softly, pushed inside mercilessly, intending to punish her for her presumption to trick me, my thumb still circling her knob. Her mouth opened in shock, and a cry of pleasure escaped, this time much more genuine, though not as intense as I would’ve preferred. I pushed in and out rapidly, the build-up of pleasure obvious on her face. </p><p>“What are you doing?” she managed to murmur. “It feels-” she tried to continue, only to be overtaken by a moan. </p><p>“I’m not a bumbling high school student, my new toy,” I answered, my beats focused on an extremely sensitive spot I managed to discover. “I know exactly how to tame an uppity bitch like you.” An expression of outrage was clear on her face, but she wasn’t able to say anything in response, busy trying to control her voice. </p><p>Her chest was moving attractively as she twisted with pleasure, and one of my hands were still free. It was an opportunity that shouldn’t be missed, I have decided as I reached for her chest and pulled her blouse down, displaying her perfectly shaped tits to my attention. I wished that I had enough time to play with them for hours, showing the respect they deserved, but unfortunately, I was short of time. Delaying too much would have destroyed the progress I made with Katie. So, I grabbed her tits, sinking my fingers in the depths of her flesh, extracting another cry of pleasure from her. </p><p>Under my furious assault, it wasn’t a surprise that she started to tremble in a merciless climax. However, I was yet to be convinced that she had been punished enough, so I continued her assault. “Stop,” she managed to murmur, her eyes glazed with pleasure, but I continued. A second one didn’t take long to arrive, damaging her already weakened foundations. Her cries rose unbidden, filling the car with a painful echo. She collapsed listlessly, her eyes barely open. </p><p>I chuckled and pulled my hand away, but not before I pulled down her panties as well. I deserved a trophy, after all. After that, I drove the rest of the direction she described, occasionally glancing at her pleasure-ravaged body, her tits marked with my attention still on display. “Nice display, I murmured as I pulled to the driveway of her house. Only then, her eyes popped open in shock, fixing her blouse, hiding her treasures away. </p><p>“Shit, that was close,” she said, then turned towards me. “Give my panties back as well.” </p><p>“Nope,” I said in a cheerful manner, waving her panties. “I don’t think I’ll give them back. I deserved a trophy, after all.” </p><p>She said nothing, just glanced to her phone. “So be it,” she said, trying to sound haughty and impervious, but that was quite hard when one’s face was still glowing with pleasure. “Keep them, after all, this is the only time you’re going to see this,” she added, gesturing to her body. “Maybe you can use it to masturbate miserably when sitting alone in your bed. And with that, she opened the door, picked up her phone, and stepped outside, walking as quick as she could without breaking to a run. </p><p>I chuckled and pulled back, taking a note to punish her for her impudence the next time we met…   </p>",

    "content": "A smile popped on my face as I read the mail from my client, approving my request to increase the charge rate for the next set of clothes. He had been as happy as me when he saw the outcome of the session with Nicole, strongly suggesting me to continue working with her. At that point, I decided to take a risk, and informed him that it was something I couldn’t afford with the current agreement, that I worked with her despite losing money on the deal, because I had promised him a deadline, and my usual model had bailed. <p>I wasn’t expecting him to casually double the payment for the next job, as well as adding a decent bonus to the set I had just delivered to compensate for my loss, but it was by no means unwelcome. I still needed to convince Nicole for another shoot, of course, but that was a challenge easy to clear. </p><p>I stood up, my body stiff from sitting in front of the computer for hours. I considered going out for a walk, but a sudden grumble from my stomach interrupted my thoughts, reminding me that I hadn’t eaten anything apart from half a bagel for breakfast. A problem, considering that I hadn’t bothered to go out shopping. </p><p>The solution was simple, I realized. Why don’t I ask my new landlady for some food? It wasn’t absurd considering our closeness earlier today. With that in mind, I walked upstairs to the ground floor. </p><p>Nicole was already downstairs, on the dinner table, accompanied by an unfamiliar young woman. “Hey, Nicole,” I said as I walked towards the dining table. “Would it be a bother if I got a bite with you guys.” </p><p>For a moment, no one spoke, and I used that to examine the girl that was accompanying Nicole. She was a young, either nineteen or twenty, with a lithe figure, and a thin, but beautiful face. However, only due to my experience working as a fashion photographer allowed me to see her beauty. Her make-up was nonexistent, and her hair was clean but not well-cared. She spoke before Nicole could utter a word, busy with blushing instead. “Hey, you must be our new tenant,” she said, a curious expression on her face as she carefully examined me. </p><p>“That’s correct,” I said with a slight nod. “My name is Stephen.”</p><p>“Katie,” she answered as she shook my hand. </p><p>“My pleasure,” I answered as I pulled a chair without bothering to wait for Nicole’s approval, because even a glance was enough to show she was in no state to answer, her abashment thick enough to seal her lips. She was lucky that Katie’s attention was fully on me, allowing Nicole’s condition to pass unnoticed. Nicole stood up wordless and walked towards the kitchen. </p><p>I considered going to the kitchen after her, curious about how she would react to be in the same room alone, but Katie acted faster. “So, Stephen, tell me a bit about yourself. Are you a serial killer?” </p><p>“Katie!” Nicole shouted from inside, her shyness forgotten for a moment. </p><p>“Sorry mom,” Katie answered with a laugh. “But it’s best to learn such things early.” </p><p>“My apologies Stephen,” Nicole said, still in the kitchen. “Unfortunately, Katie’s mouth lacks a control chip.” </p><p>“Mom! Don’t give up my secrets,” Katie said between giggles. </p><p>“No worries, Nicole, it’s not a bother,” I shouted before turning towards Katie. “There’s not much to tell about me,” I explained. “I just graduated from visual arts, and currently trying to set up my own studio.” I smiled wryly and continued with a whisper that I was sure Nicole wouldn’t be able to hear. “And unfortunately, I don’t show where the bodies are buried until the third date.” </p><p>A sudden blush invaded her face, showing me that for all of her blusterous manner, she was unused to flirting. My tenancy was getting more and more interesting. But before she could answer, Nicole stepped out of the kitchen, a plate in her hand. </p><p>“Thank you, Nicole,” I said, my mouth watering as the smell reached my nose. “That looks amazing.” </p><p>“It’s no bother,” Nicole said, her composure back in place other than a slight blush, one I only noticed because I had been looking for it. </p><p>“So, Stephen, tell me a bit about being a photographer. Is it exciting.” </p><p>“It is really amazing, especially when you have the creative freedom to reflect your imagination rather than taking stale old angles that your boss asks. Fortunately, I’m working for an unsophisticated client, which leaves me free to express my vision, however I see fit.” </p><p>A smile appeared on Katie’s face, one that tried to reflect confidence, but it was easy to see she was trying to put a front to hide her earlier abashment. “So, how it’s, working with all that beautiful models.” </p><p>“It varies,” I said in a neutral tone. “Most of the time, you don’t even register it, but sometimes, you work with some amazing talents that’s a true pleasure to work with.” I let my gaze slid to Nicole, meeting her eyes in a fleeting moment. “Let’s take my last model, for example. She was a true delight to work with. Smart, beautiful, obedient, and very sexy. I just wish that all of my models were as good as her.” </p><p>“Oh, she sounds impressive,” Katie said, not noticing Nicole’s face sliding towards a deep vermillion. “Anyway, could you tell me about some of the interesting things that happened during the shoots.” </p><p>With that, the discussion moved to some of the more interesting mishaps I had during my limited career in photography, while taking occasional bites from my meal. Then, suddenly, Katie checked her watch. “I need to finish and submit my homework,” she said in a panicked tone, and without waiting from an answer, dashed out of the table, leaving me alone with Nicole. </p><p>“It was a delicious meal,” I said, enjoying her expression as the control she managed to collect over her composure dispersed after we were left alone. “You’re an amazing cook as well as being an incredible model.” </p><p>It took several seconds for her to compose herself, something that aroused a different type of appetite in me. There was something incredibly alluring on seeing such a self-possessed and confident woman falling into pieces with just a few well-placed compliments. “Stephen…” she started, her tone reproachful, no doubt about to inform me about the inappropriateness of my comments. </p><p>It was a discussion I had no intention of having, so I simply changed the topic. “By the way, the company is very happy with the final pictures. They strongly insist that I establish a working relationship with my new model.” </p><p>“Really,” she asked in astonishment, her earlier reticence forgotten on the sideway. </p><p>“It’s not a topic that I would joke around. They are really enthusiastic about continuing to work with you.” Before I could continue, however, the doorbell rang. </p><p>“Let me get it,” she said and jumped from her seat, leaving me cursing whoever picked the time to disturb our conversation in such an inconvenient manner, providing her with the opportunity to gather her wits. I was confident that I could eventually convince her, by promising to increase her pay if all else fails, but it was not something I wanted to do. Not that it was a bother to pay a bit more was a chore, the latest raise had left me very well compensated, but the less we talked about the money, the better. </p><p>She came back to the room a few minutes later, carrying a large packet in her hands. “That came for you,” she said.</p><p>I lost all my negative feelings as soon as I saw the package. My self-appointed mission just got a lot easier. “How lucky, your next set of clothing is already here,” I said, conveniently ignoring the fact that she was yet to agree for anything. </p><p>I stood up before she could process my words. She reached towards me, her intention was to pass the package, but I grabbed her hand instead. “Come down, let's took a few test shots,” I said, even as I started walking towards the basement, with her in tow. I hadn't had to put any strength to my pull, she just trekked next to me. No comment, no resistance, silent even after we arrived at my makeshift studio. </p><p>“Why don’t you go and change for one of the swimsuits, so we can take a few test poses,” I said. </p><p>“Swimsuits,” she repeated, her voice sounding like she was being strangled. </p><p>“Yes, swimsuits,” I repeated, turning my gaze on her. “It’s not a problem, right?” It was obvious that it was, but she was having trouble talking about it. “Why don’t you open the package and check them behind the screen. We can always cancel them if you’re not feeling comfortable.” I had no intention of canceling, but the swimsuits were pretty conservative, so I doubted she would bail out. Not when doing so would sacrifice a considerable payout. </p><p>“Okay,” she murmured and walked behind the screen. I could hear her pulling the package open, followed by a low-key sound of fabric ruffling, signifying that she was changing her clothes. Meanwhile, I focused on setting up the set, waiting for her to step out. </p><p>Several minutes later, I was still waiting for her to step out, trying to hold myself from calling her out, knowing that it would be much easier in the long term that if she could defeat her shyness herself. </p><p>I turned towards the screen when I heard the screen shuffling, just in time to catch her stepping into the opening, struggling to abort the whistle of appreciation that forced my lips. I knew that her body was exquisite, as the last dress we shot was not exactly conservative, but seeing her in a swimsuit was differently alluring, even if the said swimsuit was a conservative one piece. </p><p>“Ready,” I asked, and received a nod in response. With that, I have ordered her into several simple poses, allowing her initial panic to drain under the rain of flashes. It was a delight, watching her doubt getting erased a bit more every time she bathed under the blink of light. Soon, after making sure that she was in the appropriate mood, I called her to stop. </p><p>“What happened? Did I do a mistake?” she asked with a panicked expression. </p><p>“No, Nicole. You were perfect,” I answered as I walked closer to her. “I just need to fix the back of the suit.” I was already behind her as the last words formed in my mouth, depriving her of the opportunity to do it herself. I brought my fingers where the suit met with her silken skin and dragged softly. A tremble passed through her skin, but she gave no other outward reaction about its effect. I did another pass, this time pushing the top of my finger inside the suit, dragging softly until my finger grazed the side of her breast. </p><p>I would have liked nothing more than to continue, sinking my fingers in her firm globes, but unfortunately, that was not viable for the time being. Instead, I returned to my camera and continued the shoot. “That’s good enough for a practice shot,” I said, concluding the night’s effort. “But everything was perfect. Will you be available if we do the next session nine in the morning?” </p><p>“It’s better if we do it after 11,” she countered. I raised my eyebrow in question, and the explanation followed a few seconds later. “Nancy’s writing group meets around noon, so she leaves the house at 11.” </p><p>I nodded approvingly, preferring to be alone in the house as well. It raised some really interesting possibilities. </p><p><strong>     *****       *****       *****       *****       ***** </strong></p><p>I was planning rest after Nicole left, but the sleep proved elusive, assisted by the dryness of my mouth. In another display of lack of forethought, I didn't have any water in the room, forcing me to leave my warm bed for a short trek to the kitchen. </p><p>I wasn't expecting to come across anyone that late, which was why it was surprising to see Nancy, whom I met only briefly in very interesting circumstances, was sitting in front of the TV, reaching towards the remote panickedly. </p><p>There was only one obvious reason for someone to change the channel in such an obvious display of panic when it was past midnight and they were the only person in the room. Her face, its redness obvious even with the flickering light of TV, was another clue to reinforce that conclusion. A smile tried to break out, but my efforts to suppress it had been nominally successful. “Good evening,” I said before walking towards the kitchen, giving her time to gather herself. </p><p>I returned to the living room after filling a large glass with water. She was still in front of the TV, and her face was still burning red. There was a black and white movie running on the screen, a poor attempt to convince me that she had been watching a classical movie all along. </p><p>I could have said nothing and leave her alone, but where was the fun in that. Instead, I stood in front of her, ready for a handshake. “We haven’t properly met yet. I’m Stephen,” I said.</p><p>“Nancy,” she answered, her voice cracking, not helped by being reminded our first meeting, where she was clad in her underwear. </p><p>“A pleasure to meet,” I said, and sat next to her without asking permission. “It seems like an interesting movie. What’s it about?” </p><p>“It is … a classic movie…” she said, trying to come up with something, but falling short of being convincing. </p><p>“How interesting…” I drawled before turning my attention to the screen, giving her a minute to collect herself. “So, what do you do?”</p><p>“I'm a writer,” she answered in a tone that was utterly familiar. I had several friends that introduced themselves in the same manner, shaky and without conviction. Their shared traits were their lack of success, no magazine print, no short story on the web with any traction… Nothing. And another shared trait they had, they all hated people asking whether they had anything published because it reminded them of their lack of success. The same question she expected, her shoulders fallen in shame. </p><p>“Interesting,” I answered instead. “A tough road for the newcomers. You must be very brave, able to take such a huge risk for your artistic vision.” and just like that, her face brightened like the sun. The statement was a total overreach, of course, it was hardly brave when you had the option to live with your parents, but I wasn't an idiot, so that detail got glossed over. Still, it explained why Nicole was desperate enough to get a tenant. It must be tough, trying to pay for your adult daughter as a widower. “Which genre are you writing in?”</p><p>“Mostly science fiction, but what I'm trying to do…” she said, launching an hour-long explanation into her project, with all of its nuances and details, even as I struggled to keep my mouth open, her earlier reticence long forgotten. Despite all my exhaustion, I didn't cut her off, instead of listening to her explanation with an appropriate level of feigned interest, welcoming the opportunity to build a rapport with her. </p><p>Her explanation stretched well after the movie ended, forcing me to cut her off. “That is really interesting,” I said, cutting her explanation about the difference between the sociological impact of hyperspace and wormholes, and consequent importance for her novel. “However, I need to catch some sleep. I have a busy day tomorrow.” </p><p>She looked disappointed until she checked the clock, realizing she was holding me hostage for the last one and half hours, and her expression switched with abashment. “I’m so sorry! Sometimes, I lose myself when explaining-” she continued, only to be cut once more. </p><p>“Honestly, it’s not a bother. I would have cut you off if I wasn’t interested in what you were telling. But we can continue the discussion another time.” I smirked. “It’s not like it’ll be hard to meet, right?” </p><p>“True,” she said, followed by a nervous laugh. “Anyway, have a good sleep.” She turned off the TV and walked upstairs. Unfortunately, she was wearing loose pajamas, so I was denied of another beautiful view. </p><p>Still, the first day at my new residence went much better than I had expected. I couldn’t wait to see what tomorrow would bring.<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>      *****       *****       *****       *****       ***** </strong></p><p>I woke up to the sound of the alarm at ten, sharp. Going back to sleep was attractive, but I had one hour before the shoot, and if yesterday’s trial was any indicator, Nicole required a bit of convincing before donning the swimsuit. So, I took a shower, trying to ignore the fact that it was little more than a hole in the wall. Then, after spending a few minutes making sure everything was in place, including the surprise I had set up carefully, I walked to the upstairs. </p><p>Nicole was in the living room, sitting in front of the TV. Nancy was also there, trying to finish a bowl of cereal in hurry. It was almost eleven, which meant that she was already late. “Good morning,” I said. </p><p>Nicole answered with a greeting of her own, and Nancy just waved, not stopping her eating. “Don’t be rude, Nancy,” Nicole said, her tone more exasperated than angry, showing it wasn’t the first time they had an argument in that topic. </p><p>“Sorry Stephen, but I’m about to be late,” she said before returning to her breakfast, stuffing one last scoop into her mouth. Then, she stood up as she chewed, waved to Nicole, and dashed to the door. </p><p>Nicole looked at where Nancy just disappeared, looking like was about to complain, so I cut her off. I didn’t want her to work herself over Nancy’s attitude. An aggressive mood run contrary to my objectives. I wanted her soft and pliable. “Are you ready for the shoot?” I asked. </p><p>“Now?” she said, her expression getting a panicked tone. </p><p>“I prefer to start as soon as possible,” I answered. I wanted to start before she had time to get used to the idea. More panicked she felt, easier for me to direct her thoughts. I started walking towards the basement, only to stop and turn against her after a few steps. “Come on, what are you waiting for. An invitation?” I added. It wasn’t the nicest statements, but the occasional sting was necessary to remind her that disobedience was not welcome. </p><p>She said nothing, just followed me a step behind until we were in the basement once more. “Your costumes are already behind the screen,” I said. “Why don’t you go and change the one piece you have tried yesterday. It would work better with the one you’re already familiar with.”</p><p>She just nodded before following my direction and stepped behind the screen. I was tempted to walk nearer it, trying to catch a flash of skin, wanting to see her devoid of any clothes, but I held myself back. In the current situation, it was a pointless risk, for a reward I would get after a few days nevertheless. </p><p>Still, it was a struggle to prevent myself from catcalling as Nicole stepped behind the screen, mouth-wateringly alluring. Instead, I watched her behind the camera. “Let’s start with a few simple poses…” I said, directing her through several dozens of poses, but none of them really revealing. Just like the last time, I wanted her to get used to receiving orders. </p><p>First three sets passed in a normalcy that belied my objective, but that was intentional. Not only we moved out boring clothes out of the way -two one-pieces, and one bikini that almost covered as much-  it allowed her to follow my commands quickly. </p><p>Then, she stepped outside the screen’s cover, wearing a burnt orange bikini, looking delicious. It wasn’t something that would be called risque on the seaside, but away from the water, under the spotlights, it had a different allure. </p><p>First, I focused on the technical photos, taking enough photos to cover the requirements of the client. Then, I lowered the camera and looked straight to her face. “It’s not working,” I murmured. </p><p>“Why?” she asked, panicked. “Am I doing something wrong?” </p><p>I walked towards her. “It’s the top, it’s too loose, damaging the mood I’m trying to reflect.” </p><p>“Should I tighten-” she started, but I was already behind her. </p><p>“Stay still,” I said, as my fingers found the strings that kept the swimsuit together, and without a warning, pulled. A panicked yelp escaped her mouth as the top slid off, treating me with a flash of her breasts. I would’ve preferred to let it slide, leaving her breasts bare for my gaze, but unfortunately, I wasn’t in a point I could do that without ensuring an explosion. Instead, I pulled the strings and tied the top much tighter than it previously was. </p><p>She tried to say something, but I cut her off. “Let’s continue,” I said, and snapped a picture from point-blank range, destroying her argument before it started. I let it flow naturally until she got into the flow once again, cycling through poses, following my directions. </p><p>“Loosen the top once more,” I ordered. She blushed, but said nothing as she turned back, one hand reaching for the string, the other keeping her top in place. She untied it once more, but my voice rang once more before she could fasten it. “Perfect, leave it like that,” I ordered. </p><p>Her head turned to me in shock, a perfect expression I immortalized with a click of my camera. “Amazing, now give me a smile.” </p><p>“But-” she tried to argue, but it wilted under the tapping of my foot. She struggled to put a smile on her face. It wasn’t convincing at first, but under the rapid blink of the flashes, her concerns eroded soon after, leaving her with a flickering smile on her face. I was tempted to throw down the camera and walk towards her, pulling off her bikini, tasting her until the hunger inside my quenched. But I held back. </p><p>“That’s enough for this one,” I called off a few minutes later, happy to catch a glint of disappointment in her gaze. “But, as usual, you were amazing. Why don’t you change into the last one, so we can wrap it off.” </p><p>“But that’s the last one,” she said in confusion. </p><p>“No, they said that they had four sets. Why don’t you check the bag once again? Maybe you missed them at the folds of the package or something. They are not always very careful when packing the clothes.” </p><p>“Maybe,” she murmured before walking towards the changing section, her arm still around her chest, trying to keep her top in place. She disappeared behind the screen, followed by the sound of ruffling. “You’re right, apparently I missed it,” she said, only to cut by a sharp intake of breath. “I can’t wear this!” she exclaimed. </p><p>“Why, what happened?” I asked, despite perfectly knowing the reason for her protest. </p><p>“That’s too revealing,” she said with a pleading tone. </p><p>“Come on, Nicole. We already completed most of the shoot, don’t bail on me now,” I answered, trying to plead with her instead of ordering. I had no doubt that I could force her out with a strict comment, it didn’t fit my objective. I wanted her to step out of there in her free will. Muddied by my manipulations, of course, but her free will nevertheless.</p><p>“It’s indecent,” she murmured. </p><p>“Okay,” I murmured in a fake defeat. “I won’t force you if that’s what you want, but unfortunately, we have to cancel the shot if we don’t have the last set as well, which means no pay for both of us.” That was a total bullshit, as the client’s request was already complete, and the fourth costume was my own addition. </p><p>“We have to cancel all of it?” she asked, alarmed. </p><p>“Unfortunately, yes. I had already informed the client that you reviewed and okay with all of the costumes, so they won’t agree to change it at the last minute. It would be economically damaging for both of us, but still, I don’t want to push you into something you’re not willing.” </p><p>A minute passed in silence before she spoke once more. “It’s not possible to identify me in the pictures, right?” she asked with a soft murmur, barely above a whisper. </p><p>“I promise that no one other than me would know you are the model of those pictures.” It was doubly true since I was taking them for my personal collection. I received no answer, but that did nothing to remove the smirk on my face. I could hear her changing once more. I occupied myself with changing the battery of the camera, wanting to be ready for the next step. </p><p>I was struck with the strongest urge to whistle in appreciation as she stepped out in the open, clad in a string bikini that was little more than three tiny triangles, connected together with dental floss. Her arms were around her body in a struggle to keep it hidden, one trying to hide her perfectly shaped globes. A difficult struggle, but nothing compared to the impossibility of the task of her other hand, trying to obscure the amazing expanse of her hips. </p><p>I said nothing as she skittled towards the set, finding it amusing than annoying. After all, she was going to be forced to pose in any pose I could imagine in a minute, so the only thing she achieved was to make herself more desirable. </p><p>“Ready?” asked. She nodded shakily, but her expression shouted no. Something I steadfastly ignored, of course. What was the point of pushing her into the sea of insecurity if I was going to pull her out in the first cry of help? I looked at her arms as I patted my foot on the ground in a display of impatience. Her blush intensified even through the make-up, but the important thing was her arm, falling to the side, leaving me to observe her body without any barrier. </p><p>I leaned forward in a poor attempt to hide my raging boner. Luckily, she was not in a state to pay attention, occupied by the realization of just how much skin she was displaying. “Relax,” I said. “There is no reason for you to feel self-conscious. You’re beautiful.” The compliments worked, and her skittishness subsided. “Okay, take a simple pose, like you are walking, hands flowing…” </p><p>With that, a repeat of the earlier moments started, but with a very interesting caveat. Her panic disappeared after just a few shots, and she started following the simple poses with little protest. I licked my lips in a failed attempt to combat the dryness, but my excitement was the victor. </p><p>I pulled the camera from the tripod and walked closer, wanting to immortalize the scene from a closer perspective. She raised no protest as I filled my memory card with the close-ups of her poorly covered, glistening skin. </p><p>I walked behind her, the flash exploding on her bottom repeatedly. “Turn towards me, fast enough to swing your hair,” I ordered, acutely aware of the frailty of her current clothing. A fact she was liable to forget in the heat of the moment. </p><p>She turned, her hair flailing freely as she intended. However, her beautiful globes, replicated the movement against her intention, straining her top to the limit. They failed to break out of their prison, much to my disappointment. But it wasn’t completely useless, their wild dash towards freedom managed to move them a bit, a part of her pink areolas on display. I snapped two quick photos, then ordered her to stop.</p><p>She stopped, not realizing the issue. I reached towards her top, and her eyes fell down, tracing my movement. Her mouth fell open as soon as her eyes made contact with her breasts, revealing just how much she was revealing unwittingly. She tried to raise her arms. “Stop,” I ordered, arresting her movement. </p><p>I hooked my finger underneath the fabric that was responsible for hiding her breast from wandering eyes, poor in their job, and pulled it a bit, catching a glimpse of her nipple before fixing it to its earlier state. </p><p>She whimpered. It was a soft, needy, and most importantly, a familiar sound. Many times, I had heard my old girlfriends making the same sound whenever I stretched the foreplay, deliberately keeping them on the edge. But none of them, I was able to bring to that point with a few fleeting touches. I wondered the purity of ecstasy she would experience when I finally pushed her down, slamming inside her repeatedly. Alas, it was something I had to wait a bit to test. </p><p>Instead, I pulled back and continued the shoot. I was tempted to ask her to remove her top, but I held back because of two reasons. First, I already pushed her a lot and didn’t want to push her above her tolerance, ruining all the progress I had made. Second, I didn’t trust myself to keep control, a difficult task against the mature goddess in front of me. </p><p>“And, that was the last one,” I said after pressing to the shutter one last time. “Once again, it had been an amazing session, Nicole. Congratulations.” </p><p>“Thanks,” she murmured, her earlier confidence evaporating as soon as the session was over. </p><p>She started walking towards the dressing section, but I cut her off. “Aren’t you forgetting something,” I asked, opening my arms in preparation. </p><p>She looked at me, the twitching of her arms displaying her nervousness about her state of dress. It was clear that she was trying to come up with a way to reject it without coming across as rude, or hoping that I would take pity and let her go.</p><p>Seconds passed in silence, and she failed in both accounts. She walked to me, her assets jiggling attractively with each step. She stood in front of me, and I enveloped her between my arms. It wasn’t a soft, safe hug that I enveloped her in. I held her close, her barely covered tits squashing against my chest, tight enough that I could feel her out of control heartbeat. </p><p>I placed my finger on her spine, just below the strings of her top. She stiffened. Then, I dragged it down softly, in a twisted facsimile of a caress, replacing her stiffness with a shiver. I pulled my hand after exploring the small of her back, pulling just before reaching her generous booty. It wasn’t something I was happy about, of course, I would have preferred to sank my fingers in her naked flesh until she was moaning in pleasure, but the situation hadn’t yet evolved enough to allow it. </p><p>“You’re an amazing, talented, and beautiful model,” I whispered into her ear before pulling back, happy to see a smile breaking out in her face, despite the brightness of her blush, so red that I was surprised she managed not to faint. “Why don’t you go to your room and rest a bit, you deserved after this challenging session.” </p><p>“Good idea,” she murmured, half-drunk, before turning and climbing the stairs, forgetting her earlier decision to change back before going up. Not that I was unhappy, of course. It was a delight watching her climb the stairs in her non-existent bottom, her almost naked bottom rippling in each step. </p><p>After the next shoot, she was going to be mine, I decided. </p>",

    "content": "For Sarah, every step she took towards the living room was torture, struggling to put one foot ahead of the other. She found it easy to fall behind the two men who were laughing to yet another story Thomas shared, despite the target was once again Erik, targeted by the thoughtless cruelty of her husband and his friends. Under the effects of the alcohol, Thomas didn’t even bother to soften the stories, telling them with all their nakedness, making her eyes grow in shock. She was learning about another side of her husband, a side she wasn’t sure she liked. <p>But then Erik turned towards her with a mocking smile, and she realized why he was showing no sign of anger for these stories. He was relaxed because he already knew how he was going to take his revenge… She was struck with a desire to turn back and leave, not caring about the business, or her future. She could always start working once more, and if Thomas could find a sales job, they would make more than enough to live a cozy life.</p><p>Still, she followed them to the living room. As heavy as her feet were, it was nothing compared to the weight of a deadened future. The men were already sitting on the couch when she entered, with Erik reaching for the remote. The TV blinked open a second later, showing a basketball game going on. “Nice, our guys are leading by seven,” Thomas said with a happy tone, his eyes stuck on the screen. “I wouldn’t have guessed that you now follow basketball,” Thomas said to Erik, his eyes firmly glued to the TV. </p><p>“It’s an acquired taste,” Erik answered. “But I have no doubt that tonight’s encounter is going to be quite enjoyable.” The fact that he was turned towards her with his hungry gaze left no mystery about the source of said pleasure. She walked towards the couch with heavy steps. </p><p>She would have preferred to sit on Thomas’ left, away from Erik’s hungry paws, but that required her to ignore Erik’s hand pointing at the seat that was between him and her husband. She could, of course, but that would mean that the earlier humiliation she suffered under his hands was a complete waste. </p><p>Still, it wasn’t all bad. With her husband sitting next to her, and without the visual cover the table provided, the only thing he would be able to do was to look. Not that she was happy with providing him with such a revealing view. She would have liked to pull her dress up a bit, which would significantly reduce the amount of cleavage she was providing, but only with the cost of increasing the number of legs she was displaying, and an added danger of revealing much more in an errant movement. </p><p>Then, her eyes caught the brown blanket she occasionally used when cozying up against the TV. She turned towards her unwelcome guest. “Erik,” she said, satisfaction from her victory coloring her tone, however small. “Could you pass me the blanket, I’m feeling a bit chilly.” </p><p>“Of course,” he answered with a matching smile of his own. An actual chill spread through her face against his confidence, but she still placed the blanket over her legs, hiding them from the view. She pulled her dress up a bit, reducing the cleavage that was on display. </p><p>A couple minutes passed unremarkable, broken by the occasional comments on missed scores. Complacent, Sarah started to relax. The match was already in its third period, meaning she had to suffer the position for less than twenty minutes. Since they were too drunk to talk business -her husband was, at any rate- which would necessitate Erik’s departure, ending her torture for the night. Disaster still loomed at the horizon, but she was sure that she could develop a solution after a good night’s sleep. </p><p>However, she soon learned that she wasn’t able to accurately assess the lengths he was willing to go. The first sign was a small movement she felt at the blanket. She looked down, only to see his hand disappearing under the cover. A second later, she felt his fingers brushing her thighs, and a tremble passed through her body, leaving her motionless. The last thing she expected was for him to be that daring, while her husband was literally next to her. </p><p>The blanket was a huge mistake, she realized too late. Without, the only thing that he would be able to do was to look, but under it, she could feel his fingers tracing her inner thighs, angling dangerously closer to her core. She turned towards him with a pleading expression, hoping to find a shred of mercy, only to find an uncaring glee in the depths of his gaze, mocking her for her mistake. </p><p>Still, she sat there until she felt his fingers caressing her core, sending an unwelcome jolt through her body. She grabbed her wrist, trying to push his hand away, but it was a losing battle, especially since she was unable to push too hard, afraid of alerting her husband. His fingers twisted, teasing her nether lips. </p><p>Then, his fingers moved even further, probing her entrance, trying to slip inside, a fact that she couldn’t allow, not with her husband in the swinging distance, even if he was distracted by the TV. She didn’t think she had the ability to control her voice if that was the case. She stood up, her hands on the edge of her skirt, pulling the dress down enough not to reveal much, then got away from the coach with rapid steps. </p><p>Her husband didn’t even bother to comment. Normally, she would admonish her husband for rudeness, but at that moment, the lack of attention from him was a welcome miracle. But she wasn’t able to enjoy it when Erik stood up as well, walking to the back of the seat, calling her closer with a negligent gesture of his finger. “Do you want something to drink from the kitchen,” he asked Thomas, who didn’t even bother to turn to answer, just raising his scotch glass. </p><p>Afraid of what he had in his mind, she didn’t follow his command to walk closer, instead stood in her place. But that stance lasted until he started walking towards her. Then her reflexes took over, and she took a step back before her conscious mind took the control and stopped her journey. There was little point in running away after accepting his outrageous proposal. At least, with her husband in the room, his actions would be limited, even if her husband was distracted by the match. And, the game was already closing to the end, so she had to suffer his attention less than fifteen minutes before the match was over. </p><p>She was unable to breathe as he stood just a step away, towering over her by a considerable margin. She wasn’t unfamiliar with the difference in size, her husband was as tall as him, nevertheless, she felt suffocated. It was the expression in his eyes, she realized as she tried to stand still. Her husband had never looked at her like she was a songbird, captured in his trap, helpless… At that moment, she realized, even ten minutes was far too long, but it was too late, with his hand caressing her arm, poised to prevent her from escaping, slowly crawling towards her shoulder, naked other than the flimsy string that was holding the dress up.</p><p>She wasn’t expecting him to pull it on the side, leaving her shoulder completely bare. Her hand rose in reflex, wanting to fix it. Him touching her was one thing, as they could stop if her husband ever tried to turn, or maybe come up with an explanation, but being undressed was much harder to explain. However, her hand froze halfway under his warning gaze. Her hand fell down, despite the fear that her husband might turn towards them, however unlikely with the match still going on. </p><p>He replicated his move on the other side, leaving her dress without support. Still, the dress stayed in its place, its tightness helpful for once. “Tasty,” he mouthed as he dragged his finger into her cleavage until it was pressing her dress. She looked into his eyes beggingly, hoping for a scrap of mercy. It just took a glance from her husband, and her marriage was dead. But, in the depths of his eyes, there was no mercy. With a smile that reminded her a tiger, he pulled the dress down. </p><p>She knew that she should have reacted in any way, slapping him, covering herself, shouting for her husband, turning and running away… Anything… But never expecting such a daring behavior, the only thing she was able to do was to freeze in panic, even when he grabbed her arms and dragged her towards her husband. </p><p>She realized his plan only after he dragged her until she was standing behind her husband half-naked, forced to her knees. She watched him with an unbelieving expression as he casually unbuckled his belt, unable to believe he could be this daring while her husband was just a foot away, even if he was distracted with the alcohol and the match. </p><p>Helpless, she did the only thing that was possible. She parted her lips, swallowing the head of the shaft that was teasing her lips. She had no other option, not if she wants to keep her husband unaware. She forced her mouth to open, struggling to take all he pushed inside without making a sound, a task she had realized impossible when she felt the head pressing to the end of her throat while she could still see a sizable amount was outside the confines of her mouth. It was unfair, a part of her brain commented, for such a miserable human being to be rewarded with such a huge shaft. </p><p>However, acknowledging the size did nothing when he pushed even more, and a reflexive gag escaped from her mouth, ringing in the room. She froze, mortified with shock and fear, when she heard the voice of her husband asking a question. “What was that?” Thomas asked. </p><p>“I got a bit of a hiccup,” Erik answered smoothly even as he pushed his shaft deeper into her mouth, forcing her to struggle to contain her voice. She was lucky that her husband failed to recognize the source, but didn’t want to risk a repeat, as if he turned backward even for a second, her life would be over. Luckily, Erik was leaning forward, forcing her husband to look up to talk to him, leaving the ongoing activities outside his field of vision. </p><p>Erik pushed deeper into her mouth, and only the full application of her willpower was enough to prevent her from gagging loud. She looked up him incredulously, sure that her gaze was conveying the full extent of her anger. Infuriatingly, she received only a mocking smile in return, followed by a pumping motion with his hand. The message was clear, if humiliating. </p><p>But she had well-past the point of humiliation, considering she was giving a blowjob to her husband’s schoolyard victim inside the swing distance of her husband. Sooner it ended, the better, she decided and brought her hands to the base of his shaft. After a bit of struggle where she tried to wrap her fingers around the base, pumping as quickly as possible without making a noise.</p><p>“I see that you are a supporter of our guys as well,” she heard her husband saying to Erik. “Considering that you are looking that satisfied with a prospect of victory.”</p><p>“Do I? How interesting,” Erik said, and she was sure that her husband had completely missed the mocking undertone, having no reason to suspect he was busy fucking his wife’s mouth. </p><p>“Yeah,” Thomas answered with a coarse laugh. “You look like you're about to cram in your pants, man.”</p><p>“No, I'm sure that I'm not going to stain my underwear,” Erik answered with a laugh of his own, few shades darker. “Anyways, let's drink to victories.” She was sure that he wasn’t talking about the match. She heard the clink of crystal, followed by gulping as they drained their glasses. </p><p>“By the way, have you seen Sarah,” Thomas asked. “She is not around for a while.”</p><p>“She was looking hungry, so I'm sure she is busy stuffing herself.”</p><p>“Really, snacking is not a common habit of hers,” Thomas said.</p><p>“You might be surprised,” Erik added, making her realize that there was no limit of feeling humiliated. Every time she felt like she had hit the rock bottom, he managed to push deeper through the barriers that she thought solid, unbreakable. </p><p>With the match drawing closer, her husband lost her interest for the discussion, a fact she welcomed as a silver lining to her vigil. She focused on her attempts to bring him to a climax because she wanted to extract herself from the situation, more time she had to slip away unnoticed. She squeezed her fingers tight, a feeling that was enjoyable if the moan that left his mouth was any indicator. She could hear Erik continuing to talk with her husband, a discussion that interrupted often with the clink of their glass, though she wasn’t able to discern the content, her attention firmly on the thick meat that was trying to push deeper into her throat despite her struggle to keep it at bay. </p><p>She felt something was wrong when she heard the volume of the TV getting louder, but before she could come up with a reason, she felt two hands wrapping at the back of her head. A strain of fear passed through her, but it was already too late to react as he pushed his cock into her throat mercilessly, passing through her throat. </p><p>She had always hated deep-throating, even when she was in college, well aware that it was just another way for males to feel dominant. The fact that she was actually being dominated did little to take the sting out of that fact. She would have liked to push him away, but she was busy with something much more important. To keep her voice low. The TV was masking the unwitting gagging and wheezing that was escaping her throat, but only up to a point, forcing her to use the entirety of her focus to control her voice. A fact that didn't make any easier with her cut breath, making her lungs burn painfully, and her sight blotted.</p><p>She wasn't proud of the fact that the first emotion she felt when she felt his shaft throbbing deep into her throat, filling her mouth with a viscous liquid, was a satisfied relief. Though understandable, considering she managed to avoid alerting her husband throughout her torture.</p><p>But she met with a thoroughly unwelcome sight when she looked upwards. Erik’s face, adorned with a smug smile, she was expecting. The phone in his hand, much less so. “Nice camera presence,” he mouthed silently, shaking the camera jokingly as he pulled his shaft out of her mouth, leaving her frozen with cum dripping from her lips. </p><p>She was filled with a red-hot helplessness, humiliating bright enough to suppress her desire to stab him. She couldn't even tell, or attempt to take the camera. It would be hard to explain to her husband why she was wrestling with Erik bare-chested while a suspicious pearly liquid stained her lips. So, she said nothing, just pulled the dress up, stood up.</p><p>The mystery of her husband's awareness revealed itself. Her husband was passed out drunk, his mouth open wide, his snores hidden by the volume of the TV. She felt a stab of anger worming itself into her heart. It wasn't her husband's fault, other than drinking like a frat boy, but nevertheless, he was a convenient target to her rage.</p><p>Then she realized the opportunity generated by his untimely unconsciousness. She turned back, and grabbed Erik’s phone off his hand, and before he could react, she slammed it on the ground, blasting it to the smithereens. She sent a smug smile to Erik. “I think that’s enough for the dinner, you can see yourself out,” she said, the sense of victory coloring her tone. Then, she turned and started climbing the stairs. Her sense of victory wasn't entirely warranted, she knew, but after the horrible night she suffered, every bit counted.</p><p>     *****     *****     *****</p><p>Sarah wasn’t feeling very energetic when she woke up, alone since she hadn’t bothered to wake her husband up. A horrible night’s sleep on the couch was the least he deserved after leaving her at the mercy of his rival, focusing on a bottle of scotch instead. She licked her lips, still tasting the pungent aroma of Erik’s cum despite the hours passed and the several rounds with mouthwash. She was sure it was physiological rather than physical, but it tasted disgusting nevertheless. </p><p>Normally, she would have changed into something more attractive. It was the usual weekend ritual in their home, starting the holiday with some hot action. However, she was not feeling charitable enough after the horrible night she had experienced, still present in her memory. So, she just pulled a morning gown over before walking downstairs. </p><p>She wasn’t exactly surprised to see her husband sitting on the couch, trying to rub his head in a desperate attempt to bring some relief, beset by the hangover that remained from the last night. “Morning,” she said, intentionally loud. </p><p>“Could you speak a bit softer please, honey,” Thomas answered. “My head is killing me.” </p><p>“How surprising. You barely drank anything,” Sarah responded, not breaking her stride towards the kitchen, not feeling even the slightest bit of mercy towards her husband. </p><p>“You don’t have to be such a bitch about it,” her husband murmured. </p><p>Sarah felt her anger roaring into an inferno with his words. It wasn’t enough that he had chosen a horrible business partner which caused the most humiliating moments of her life, and spent the night drunk instead of focusing on the deal that was supposed to save their business, but he was also trying to act like he was the victim of the circumstances. “I don’t?” she shouted. “Even when you spent the whole night drinking instead of signing the agreement that was supposed to be vital.” </p><p>A panic went through Thomas’ face. “Didn’t we sign the agreement? Shit!” With panic, he reached for his phone, trying to call Erik. Sarah walked back to the kitchen, knowing that Erik wouldn’t be able to receive the call with his phone destroyed. She wanted her husband to suffer a bit. It was the least he deserved. “By the way,” she said as she walked out of the kitchen, carrying a green smoothie she prepared for herself. “I remember his phone falling last night. Maybe it broke down or something. Have you tried calling his office?” </p><p>“Why didn’t you tell it earlier,” her husband tried to berate her, but she just shrugged and walked outside. She wanted to relax a bit next to the pool, enjoying the soft breeze, getting her mind away from the last night’s disgrace. But that was not to be, proven when her husband came to their back-garden, his eyes squinted in a vain attempt to avoid the bright sun. “I managed to reach Erik. He is inviting us for lunch to sign the agreement.” </p><p>“Us? Can’t I just stay at home?” </p><p>“No, you can’t. He explicitly called you to thank you for the last night’s dinner, and I already accepted the invitation for you. Just go upstairs and change. We leave in ten minutes.”</p><p>“Of course,” Sarah spat as she stood up. “God forbid if you try to get a deal without parading your wife like a stripper.”</p><p>She started walking away without waiting for his answer. She wasn’t being entirely fair, she knew, but the anger and humiliation burning inside her didn’t allow for anything else. “Don’t play the martyr,” Thomas shouted from behind. “You just wore a short dress, it’s not a big deal. No need to exaggerate.”    </p><p> “I’ll show you what is a big deal,” she murmured in a tone that went unheard, determined to make her husband eat her words. Not to mention, they were going to be in a public place, meaning Erik would be able to do nothing but look longingly at something he was never going to taste anymore. With the deal about the be sign, and the video he took gone, he simply had no leverage he could use to solicit anything from her. With those thoughts in her mind, her hands reached for a short, plaid skirt, and a white blouse. Both were on the conservative side, but she folded the skirt on the waist a couple of times, shortening it effectively. A similar treatment to the blouse as well, popping a couple of extra buttons free, and the view was much more revealing than the poor material initially suggested, especially after she picked a set of lacy red underwear, much more fitting for evening fun instead of wearing under a white blouse. </p><p>She could see the anger flashing in her husband’s face as soon as she stepped into the living room. “What the fuck are you wearing?” he exclaimed. </p><p>“It’s just a short skirt, right? It’s not a big deal. There is no need to exaggerate,” she answered, mirroring her husband’s earlier comments with glee, underlining each word. </p><p>“Fine,” Thomas answered blithely, the realization clear on his face. “I don’t want to be late, let’s go.” </p><p>The drive passed in absolute silence. Suffering under a combination of anger and hangover, Thomas showed no inclination of speaking, a fact that suited Sarah just fine. The last thing she wanted was to talk as well. They arrived in the restaurant they were supposed to meet, a small but sweet French Bistro, and Sarah stepped out of the car, without even waiting for the valet to reach for the door, got off the car and walked towards the restaurant. She could see the burning jealousy in her husband’s eyes and understood that valet was busy watching her skirt dancing with each step. But instead of pushing it down, she put an extra swing to her every step. She didn’t like to be ogled like a piece of meat in the normal circumstances, but she was willing to make an exception to annoy her husband.</p><p>The waiter on the door was more professional, meaning he just spent several seconds examining her cleavage before pulling his gaze up, pulling the door open for her. She stepped inside, and Thomas was next to her a second later. “Please follow me, sir, madam,” the waiter mumbled, trying to deflect her husband’s gaze. A few seconds later, they were on a partially separated section, with Erik already waiting for them in the table. “Thomas, Sarah, welcome,” he said as he stood up.</p><p>Thomas shook his hand first, then Sarah pointed her hand towards him. She would have preferred not to let her hand in his clammy grip, but that would be hard to explain to her husband. She was glad that almost no small talk happened, with their attention stolen by the final agreement, going on line by line to ensure that they were aligned on the topics. She started to hope that Erik had gotten the message, and was going to leave her alone. She pulled her phone to browse the net.  </p><p>It didn’t take long for him to invalidate that assumption. She felt something rubbing in her inner thigh, too rough to be a hand. She turned towards the source, only to met with a smug smile. She let one of her hands sneak under the tablecloth, trying to push him away, but her struggle was in vain, even when she pushed harder than she supposed to. </p><p>“Is everything okay, honey,” Thomas said, the annoyance obvious on his face. It was less that he was trying to understand if there was something he could help, and more of his warning for her to stand still, not to distract him while he as busy with important stuff. She could have stood up and gone to the bathroom, of course, but she hadn’t wanted to risk the deal at the last minute. Just until they sign the deal, she repeated in her mind, again and again, trying to ignore his toe caressing the edges of her flimsy underwear. </p><p>She hoped that he wouldn’t go too far in a public place, a hope that had come empty a few seconds after its inception when his toe moved sideways until it was resting on her slit, separated by her flimsy underwear. Once again, she cursed herself for letting to be carried by a silly argument with her husband, leaving herself vulnerable for his predations. </p><p>“How is everything, Sarah,” Erik interjected. “I hope you are enjoying the lunch.” </p><p>“I can’t complain,” she answered, not bothering to force her expression to display anything other than pure contempt since her husband was captivated by the agreement, not bothering to turn towards her even when an involuntary gasp escaped her mouth. </p><p>Minutes passed where she silently suffered under Erik’s toe, and the slow tingling that was starting to fill her belly didn’t make her feel any better. Nor the sudden presence of the disappointment, flaring surprisingly in her as Erik and her husband signed the deal, and Erik pulled away. “I need to make a quick call to my lawyer,” Thomas said as he stood up, leaving them alone in the room. “I’ll be right back in two minutes.” </p><p>Her husband left, leaving her alone with Erik, who had a huge smile on his face. “You had your fun,” Sarah said in a scathing voice. “But the deal is signed, and your little game came to an end.” </p><p>“Oh, really?” Erik answered, his expression amused enough to worry Sarah. </p><p>Still, she bulldozed through the worry and answered with a tone that sounded much more confident than she was feeling. “It’s too bad that your phone had been broken in that unfortunate accident, right?” She smirked. “We might be talking a different game if you still had the video, of course. Maybe you should learn how to hold onto your phone.” </p><p>“It’s an interesting comment,” Erik said, pulling his phone out, obviously new, and pressed a few buttons. </p><p>Sarah felt her phone buzzing. “I don’t see what you expect me to do when you spam-” she started, only to be silenced by a soft gesture of his hand. </p><p>“I would check that message if I were you,” Erik said. </p><p>Her earlier confidence drained in an instant against the absolute confidence oozing from his eyes. She unlocked the screen and saw that she had received a picture from an unknown number. She tried to click, but with the sudden trembling of her fingers, she succeeded only in her third try. She felt the blood draining off her face. “How? Your phone was in pieces?!” </p><p>“I had to admit, it was a good thought,” Erik answered, his smile getting wider. “It’s too bad that my phone backs up automatically to the cloud.” </p><p>Sarah could feel her breathing getting out of control, her hands trembling. Without saying anything else, she stood up, and dashed towards the bathroom. Thankfully, it was empty. “Fuck. I’m a total idiot,” she murmured to herself. “What was I thinking, taunting him verbally, dressing like a slut.” She had a bad feeling about her future. </p><p>She decided to stay in the bathroom for several minutes in order to calm herself a bit. The last thing she needed was for her husband to see her ragged state and ask questions about it. But once again, her plans didn’t work like she expected, when she heard the door opening a few minutes later, revealing the last person that she wanted to see. </p><p>“You can’t be here,” she said reflexively as she took a step back. “It’s the ladies room.” </p><p>“Come on, Sarah,” Erik said as he slowly prowled towards her. “Such concerns are beneath us, with the closeness we are already sharing.” </p><p>“Please, we don’t have to do it,” she said, trying to convince him to change his mind, even though she had no intention of doing anything of sorts. </p><p>“Oh, I disagree,” Erik answered. “I was not going to do anything, but then you tried to mock me in your perceived stupid victory. Did you know I was going to let you free until you stupidly ran your mouth?” Sarah stood frozen, cursing her stupid pride. “But now,” he continued, close enough to put his hand onto her body. She watched his hand slowly drawing closer like a rabbit hypnotized by the approach of the snake, motionless. </p><p>He placed his hand on her chest, the flimsy fabric of her blouse affording her no protection. His fingers sank deep into her flesh, extracting a moan from her. She said nothing, consoling herself with the fact that her husband was at the restaurant, meaning Erik wouldn’t be able to keep her inside for long without triggering her husband’s suspicions. </p><p>Still, it was a small consolation when someone she despised was busy exploring her body without paying the slightest respect for her needs. Even worse, she could feel her body responding his touch, her breathing quickening due to something other than panic this time. Wanting it to end, she said nothing when his other hand slid at her back. It was too late when she realized his intention. His fingers were already around the clasp of her bra. He unlocked it one smooth motion, and his other hand slid through her cleavage, and pulled it off. “Much better, right?” Erik said, then chucked her bra into the trash can. </p><p>“What the hell!” Sarah shouted in a panic, a part of her mind trying to come up with an explanation to her husband, only to fail miserably. </p><p>“You look better like that,” Erik answered, his hands back on her chest, caressing it softly. “And I’m interested to see how you are going to explain the absence of your bra to Thomas.” </p><p>Shocked, Sarah barely reached when his fingers wrapped around her waist and pulled her towards the entrance. She just followed without any resistance, a part of her shocked at her own obedience. But she wasn’t able to focus on that, because as soon as they stepped out of the bathroom, they came across the same waiter that she saw at the entrance. His eyes dipped down after spending the second recording just who she stepped out with before sinking back into her breasts, his smile getting wider when noticed the obvious absence of her bra. She blushed, her free arm jumping up to cover up her chest. They continued walking through the corridor, but Sarah pulled her arm off his grasp. Things were hard to explain as is without him holding her. </p><p>She decided to frame it as another attempt to make him jealous. It was going to cause a huge row, Sarah knew, but it was easier to explain than why she lost her bra to his new business partner. </p><p>More than one table was discreetly watching her as she returned the table. She was just glad that their table was relatively covered. Even more importantly, her husband was not there yet. She sat down, trying to slouch in a poor attempt to hide silhouette of her breasts, visible through the thin white fabric. “By the way,” Erik said. “Thomas already left, he had to visit the lawyer to finalize the deal. But don’t worry, I promised him that I’ll drop you home.” </p>",

    "content": "It was a weird feeling to look at the new place that was going to be my home for the next year. It was a nice, two-story building, one that would be an achievement to own as a fresh college graduate, even to rent.<p>Unfortunately, it was only the basement I was able to afford. Sad, but not unexpected. After all, I had chosen my major in visual arts, focusing on photography, willfully ignoring the fact that it was almost impossible to get a well-paying job, or even a job, after graduation. I believed that I had the ability to burst through the unbreakable ceiling, working with the best magazines, spending my nights with models who were desperately trying to get a photo shoot with me…</p><p>The reality didn’t agree with my generous plans. There were no cushy jobs in top magazines, nor models desperately begging, willing to anything for a favor, and the student loans were crushing. The only luck I had was to find a freelance gig for an online shopping site, and even for that, the pay dwindled into nothing after I subtracted the pay for the models and the rent for the studio.</p><p>Which was why I was standing in front of this house. I was lucky enough to come across the ad a few days ago, where I was desperately looking for an affordable place to stay, since I had to leave the dorm. The basement was amazing, completely lacking windows, but with a tall enough ceiling that I could leverage it as a makeshift studio until I could make some money, freeing me from one of the biggest costs, renting a studio for each photo shoot. The landlady wasn’t intending to rent it to a male, but a bit of playing the good boy, together with the offer to pay first three months in advance was enough to change her mind. </p><p>I even managed to stop myself from flirting with her, which was a veritable challenge. The landlady was a drop-dead gorgeous lady in her early thirties, one of the best bonuses of the place. I pressed the doorbell, and the door opened after a small delay, and the landlady stood on the other side, dressed in comfortable looking, but very conservative, sweatpants.  “Stephen, welcome to your new residence,” she said in a kind, welcoming voice, inviting me inside with a gesture, though it wasn’t hard to catch an underlying reticence in her tone.</p><p>I wasn’t really surprised to sense the reservation in her tone. She had mentioned me that her husband died a few years ago, and she was living with her daughters. It made sense that she was feeling stressed about a stranger about to reside in their house. Still, she was lucky, as the safety and happiness of the children were sacrosanct to me. I would do my best to protect and assist them. Unfortunately for her, the same protection didn’t extend to sexy, voluptuous widows. </p><p>I followed her to the living room, my eyes were firmly on her bottom, watching as it shifted enticingly despite her loose pants. I spend a bit of time imagining the treasures that lay underneath, and how long it would take to convince her to reveal those treasures to my eyes. I opened my mouth to ask for whether the basement was ready for me to move in, but only a strangled gasp left my mouth.</p><p>I wasn’t proud of the noise that I made, but I had a good reason for it. I wasn’t expecting for a young woman to walk down the stairs, clad only in her underwear, no matter how conservative, and a pair of fluffy rabbit slippers, her eyes half-closed lazily. Curious, my landlady followed my gaze and looked upstairs, only to start shouting. “Nancy, what the hell are you doing! I told you that we are going to have a guest!”</p><p>Nancy’s eyes popped open, and a strangled gasp left her mouth. “Mom!” she shouted, the mortification clear in her tone before turning and dashing through the stairs. I knew that it was wrong to look, but knowing its wrongness and actually refraining from watching as she climbed up the stairs was two different things, so I stayed focused on the lithe body that bounced the stairs. I was lucky that my landlady was busy watching her disappear instead of looking towards me. I didn’t think that she would have taken well that I was watching her daughter run away.</p><p>“I’m so sorry for embarrassing you,” she said as she turned towards me, reading the reason for my redness wrong. “It's my fault, I should have reminded her that you were going to arrive today. My oldest is a bit absentminded.”</p><p>“Not a problem,” I answered, but my mind was already on the next issue, trying come up with a nice way of asking. When she had first mentioned having a daughter, I assumed she would be a small child, considering my landlady didn't look a year over thirty, and even that was a stretch. But the girl who called her mother was clearly in her twenties.</p><p>She spoke before I could verbalize the question. “She is one of the daughters my late husband had from his first marriage,” she explained, resolving the minor mystery. “But the lack of direct blood bond doesn't make her my daughter any less,” she added, complete with the threatening gesture. The message was clear. They were under her full protection.</p><p>“Understood,” I said with a placid smile. She was off-limits, if there was a risk of my landlady being aware, of course. Otherwise, it was the free season. “Is the basement ready? Sooner I set-up there, the better. I already have a shoot that I need to clear until tomorrow, and the model I arranged is going to be here in a couple hours.”</p><p>She nodded, and I grabbed my luggage once more, trying to ignore their crushing weight. A few minutes later, I was looking at the room that was going to double as my workplace and my residence for a foreseeable future. On the one side, all of my personal effects were piled over a small bed, not that there was many, as I had to sell a lot of my belongings just to raise some capital for the tools of my trade.</p><p>I looked proudly to the items that rested on the left side of the room, and an early model camera that was perched over a worn-out tripod, the reflectors with more than one patch to repair the holes left by the careless smoking of the previous owner. Lenses rested in a beaten box, dirty with scratches. Still, I looked at them lovingly, knowing just how lucky I was to get them for less than two grand. They would have cost well above ten thousand if I tried to buy them brand-new. </p><p>I left my clothes as a pile, and turned my attention to my studio instead. I wanted everything to be perfect for my first shoot…</p><p>PAGE</p><p>PAGE</p><p>PAGE </p><p>I was trying to contain my annoyance as I climbed the stairs, but it was a difficult task when an uppity slut had screwed up most of my plans, just because she remembered that she was supposed to attend a party at the last minute.</p><p>It wasn't that she was a unique beauty that was hard to replace. On the contrary, she was sub-par, both in attitude and in beauty. But there was one advantage that was hard to beat, that she was willing to work below the industry standards. It was important, because the job itself wasn't very lucrative. I tried to call a couple other cheap models that I occasionally worked with, but none of them were available for the day, which left me in a bind. I was supposed to finish the three dresses I had today. </p><p>Of course, I could always reach for an agency for a model, but their rates were much higher, high enough that I might actually lose money if the process if the shoot was delayed for any reason and I had to keep her for an extra hour. </p><p>\"You look distracted,\" I heard my landlady saying. I turned, and saw her in the living room, watching TV.</p><p>\"A bit,\" I answered. \"My model just canceled on me. I'm trying to arrange a replacement, but with the time crunch, I'm not having much luck.\" Then, I noticed something important, one I might not have noticed if I wasn't under such a big pressure. Her sizes looked very similar to the model that was supposed to come. I wasn't completely sure with the loose clothing she was wearing, but I was sure enough to risk it. I let her continue talking, trying to come up with a delicate way to breach the topic, one that wouldn't leave me on the curb on the first day of my tenancy.</p><p>\"Too bad that you couldn't use me as your model, right?\" she said with a soft laugh. From her expression, it was obvious to see that it was a self-deprecating joke that wasn't meant to be taken seriously.</p><p>But I wasn't an idiot, so I pushed forward. I took a step forward, and let my gaze browse through her body in an obvious manner until she shifted in discomfort. \"Actually, I'm not sure about that,\" I added, using the most professional and calm voice I could muster.</p><p>\"What do you mean?\" she asked, her discomfort taking the backseat for a moment as her curiosity asserted itself.</p><p>\"You are a tall, beautiful young woman with a well-cared body. I fail to see why you can't be a model.\"</p><p>A blush much thicker than I have expected spread on her face. \"But, I can't… It's not proper. And I’m not exactly young anymore\"</p><p>\"It's a job like any other,\" I said, a bit of passion infecting my voice despite my best effort. \"There is no shame involved in modeling.\"</p><p>\"I don't know…\" she murmured once more, looking like she was about to reject the proposition.</p><p>I decided to change the tracks, focusing on the most important detail. She needed money enough to rent her basement to a man she didn't know, for a sum of a few thousand, indicating that she was having severe financial issues. \"The pay is two hundred dollars per session,\" I said.</p><p>Her expression changed immediately. \"Two hundred for a days' work?\"</p><p>\"Not for a day's work,\" I added, then continued hurriedly as her enthusiasm seemed to drain. \"For two hours, or three hours tops.\" It was actually a bit more than what I was going to pay for today's model, but still well below what an agency would charge.</p><p>\"A hundred dollars an hour,\" she murmured, shocked.</p><p>\"A hundred that IRS has no idea about its existence,\" I said.</p><p>She looked conflicted, and for a moment, I was sure that she was about to accept, but then she spoke once more. \"No, I can't,\" she said, though the conflict was obvious in her tone.</p><p>\"You can put on a wig, some make-up, and a bit of careful digital retouching later, I can make sure that no one could identify you,\" I added, trying to break the most likely cause of her unwillingness. Luckily, there was actually a wig in today’s set, because the company was obsessive about the hair color of their model. </p><p>\"Really, no one?\" she murmured, making me smile inwardly with the satisfaction of a perfect hit.</p><p>\"Sure, let me prove you,\" I said, turned back and started walking. She followed me and soon we were in the basement.</p><p>\"It looks nice,\" she said, her attention grabbed by the changes.</p><p>\"I did my best,\" I added even as I reached for the clothes pack that was sent by the company, pulling the wig out. For once, their cheapness was helpful for my needs. They were quite peculiar about the hair color they wanted their clothes matched with, but they were not willing to pay enough to actually find a model that had that color naturally or as a die. \"Why don't you put that on and walk just in front of the screen, so I could prove just how different I can make you.\"</p><p>She said nothing, but followed my directions nevertheless, which was the important face. Soon, she was cycling through a few basic poses based on my commands. \"Good instincts,\" I said, impressed. She was quite easy to work with, despite the fact that it was the first time she was posing professionally. Not only she was able to follow the commands correctly after a few tries, she also didn’t have the undeserved ego the failed models I usually worked with, wasting half of the shoot with their pointless opinions and bickering. \"Now let's see just how different we can make you without destroying your beauty,\" I added, leaving a big blush on her face. A bit of flattery was never amiss.</p><p>I worked on the computer silently for a couple of minutes, mostly applying predefined filters and some broad strokes, prioritizing speed over the quality since it was not a final product but just a conceptual sample. \"It's so beautiful and foreign,\" she murmured when I showed her the picture.</p><p>\"Just foreign,\" I said, and her expression started to sour until I uttered my next words. \"You are already beautiful, we just changed a few details.\" And just like I expected, she blushed once more, surprising me with the vulnerability she was showing towards even the simplest components. She must have stayed away from the dating scene for a while to take care of her stepdaughters, or the fact that she had daughters scared a lot of guys, like I expected to share the home with a few brats instead of hot twenty-somethings. \"So, are you ready to start?\"</p><p>\"I don't know…\" she murmured yet again, but this time, I could see that I was close to victory.</p><p>\"You know, if they like the poses, there is no reason for us to not to work together for the other shootings as well. I'm sure that the extra revenue of a thousand wouldn't hurt.\"</p><p>\"A thousand a month?\" she repeated in surprise. \"Do you think I can earn that much?\"</p><p>\"I don't see a reason not to, you are young, beautiful, and skilled,\" I repeated. \"Why don't you go and try the clothes on the pack. And as an added perk, I'm sure that I could convince the company to gift them to you, including the make-up set they added to keep the color.\"</p><p>\"Really,\" she said with a clear enthusiasm, making me realize that I should have started on that. Women and clothes, I would never understand it. Ironic, considering what I was making my living off. She picked the clothes and went upstairs, ignoring the small section I separated as a makeshift dressing room. </p><p>I turned my attention to the set as I waited for her arrival, conducting one last check on the equipment. I wanted everything to be ready before she came back. More time I spent trying to fix things, more time she would have to change her mind, and I didn't want that to happen. I needed this job to be completed without a hitch.</p><p>I raised my gaze as I heard the door open, only to see my landlady dressed in a nice dress, a bit tighter than it should be owing to her generous bosom and voluptuous bottom, but it worked even better like that. I was sure the company wouldn't have any problem. I certainly didn't have any. \"It looks perfect,\" I said.</p><p>\"Really,\" she said, doubt clear on her words, but nevertheless climbing down the stairs. \"Don't you think it's a bit too tight?\"</p><p>\"Nope,\" I answered without skipping a beat. \"It's just perfect. Now, stand in the middle, and give me a relaxed pose.\" She complied. \"Now raise your hand a bit, and give me a bright smile…\"</p><p>The next half an hour passed in a similar vein until I was able to gather an appropriate amount of decent pictures, a nice surprise. Even with the best estimation, I was expecting it to last more than an hour for the first set, owing for her lack of experience, but that she adapted much better than I had hoped to. She wasn't suddenly a top-tier model, but her ability to emote and pose was more than enough for the third rate website I was working for. More importantly, she followed my every command without any delay.</p><p>\"Excellent. You’re a natural,\" I said, breaking the flow. \"Why don't you take five minutes to rest, maybe drink some fluids, then we can move onto the dress.”</p><p>\"Really!\" she asked, her face bright with excitement, acting more like a teenager. \"You're not telling me just to make me feel better, right?\"</p><p>\"Certainly not, Nicole,\" I said, deciding to take the chance to use her first name, testing the closeness that had inevitably built up during the period where she followed my every order.</p><p>\"It's a relief,\" she answered, not commenting on my usage of her first name, instead of walking towards the package that was holding the second dress. \"Isn't it a bit on the small side,\" she murmured, raising the dress over her silhouette.</p><p>I certainly agreed. It was much more revealing compared to the other dress, but thankfully, not as much as the one that would come after it. I had a feeling that she would have called off the shoot if she saw the other dress, but my luck held true, and her attention was firmly on the second one instead. She disappeared, holding the dress in her hands, only to appear a few minutes more, wrapped tightly in blue fabric. It fitted even better than I had hoped for, the dress hinting everything while leaving the mystery intact.</p><p>\"Ready? Go back to the screen,\" I ordered, already looking through her through the camera. I could see that she wasn't completely sure about the dress, so I decided to push her a little. And to my pleasant surprise, she followed it almost automatically.</p><p>I was happy to be holding the camera in a way that would block my face, because it hid the sudden predatory smile that bloomed on my face. I noticed that my landlady was displaying several submissive tendencies, so it was like an unexpected gift. Even better, with still two dresses remaining, I had the perfect excuse to test just how far I could push her.</p><p>Still,  I did nothing out of the ordinary for the first few minutes, allowing her to come to terms with being recorded while wearing a revealing dress, at least to her sensibilities. But her hesitance drained quickly once she bathed under the reflectors, signaling it was finally the time to push forward with the plan.</p><p>\"Now, turn your back,\" I ordered, and she did like she had done several times before. The next part, however, was something new. \"Now, lean forward like you were about to pick something from a low table.\" She followed my command, but decided to bend her knees instead of leaning forward. \"Knees straight,\" my voice rang, sharper, more commanding than the usual.</p><p>Her body complied automatically, and she leaned forward, the dress riding up, displaying her milky thighs. I pressed the clicker with the full knowledge that I couldn't use that one for the site, as it was much more suggestive than they would be comfortable for such a dress.</p><p>The realization passed through her face a second later and she turned, her expression telling that she was about to complain, but I interjected before she could verbalize her grievance. \"Good job, now, stand straight, and look to the side with a smile.\" And just like that, her argument was stalled as she rushed to her new pose.</p><p>\"Turn towards me and reach towards the ground, your knees bending a bit,\" I ordered, and she did so. To her defense, she raised her hand to cover the cleavage that would occur in such move. Until my next order, that was. \"Press your finger to your lips like you were surprised,\" I ordered. She tried to bring the hand she was using for the fake reach, but my voice rang commanding. \"Keep your right hand in position,\" I ordered. It wasn't that I shouted, but my tone brokered no argument, demanding obedience. I had a submissive girlfriend when I was in college, and I knew what would work best in that case. </p><p>This time, the panicked expression came before the motion, fully aware that she was going to reveal more than she initially intended, but she did nevertheless. She brought her hand to her lips, leaving her cleavage, which would be quite modest if it wasn't for the peculiarity of the pose, revealing a delicious hint of flesh.</p><p>I could have let her go up, in the same way a lion that just caught a deer might let her go. Theoretically possible, but not very likely. \"I want a bigger smile from you, but without erasing the surprise.\"</p><p>\"How?\" she murmured.</p><p>\"Try to imagine yourself in that pose unwittingly, but try to enjoy the feeling that someone is looking down into your dress, captivated by your amazing breasts.\"</p><p>\"But-\" she started, only to fade when I let the camera fall down a bit, peering into her eyes, my face stern, without inflection. Without saying anything else, she took the pose once more, her lips tugging with a hesitant imitation of a smile.</p><p>\"Better,\" I said with a soft tone, rewarding her for her good behavior. \"A smile fits your beautiful face much better than a frown.\" Her smile trembled for a second, but this time, instead of trying to disappear, it was struggling to expand. A second later, the smile won the impromptu contest, spreading on her face. I took several shots even though it wasn't the pose that I had in mind, there was little reason to associate happiness with punishment. \"Now, try to add a little mischievousness in that smile,\" I gently directed her. \"Like you are playing a little joke at me.\"</p><p>She did so, causing my pants to go tighter. There was something innately erotic with that particular pose, one that awakened a desire to taste it without delay. Unfortunately, that was not a possibility, at least, not yet. Still, there was no harm in a bit of a preview. \"Bring your arms to the side of your breasts, but keep the position stable otherwise,\" I ordered, and to my surprise, she did so without hesitation, enhancing the view even further. \"Excellent,\" I added. \"Now why don't you stand up once more,\" I added, letting her pull out from that particular revealing pose. I could have pushed further, of course, but there was little point testing her resistance until the third dress, where the real fun was about to begin.</p><p>\"That's it for this one as well,\" I said, calling the session for a close.</p><p>\"Was it as good as the first one,\" she asked, her face glowing with excitement.</p><p>\"Even better,\" I answered. \"You have a real talent for modeling. Now, why don't you change for this,\" I added, passing the dress to her. \"Hurry up, we are a bit restricted for time.\" It was bullshit, of course, as I have informed her earlier that there was no time crunch. But just as I hoped, with the elation of a well-done job, she missed the contradiction with my earlier statement, just as she missed checking the type of the dress she just picked up.</p><p>Fifteen minutes passed, a time that was more than enough to change, leaving me worried that she had a change of mind after seeing the dress. But just as I was about to walk to upstairs, to check whether I could convince her, when the door opened, and her head pointed out from the entrance, rest of her body hidden behind the door. \"I don't think this dress is the correct size,\" she murmured.</p><p>\"Hard for me to comment without seeing,\" I said, letting just the right amount of annoyance to slip into my tone. She ducked her head in shame, yet appeared in the doorway. She looked amazing with the small black dress around her body, tight and short enough that even a slutty girl would have thought twice before wearing it to a club, and the fact that the dress was sized for someone less curvy than her made things even better. \"Why are you waiting there, come down so I can take a good look of you,\" I added, watched satisfyingly as she climbed down the stairs, the tightness of the dress failing to hide the way her body trembled with each step.</p><p>“It seems perfectly okay for me,” I said, trying my best to sound clinical, hoping that my arousal was going to be unnoticed. “Stand in the center, we are starting the shoot in a minute.” </p><p>“But-” she murmured, her complaint aborted by a glare once more, and she took a relaxed pose in the middle of the room. I started, excitement blossoming in my heart. The time for compliance was getting shorter with each order, making me curious that just how far I could push her. Again, I kept my orders strictly limited to the safe poses for a while, until I decided it was the time.  </p><p>“It’s not working,” I said, with a sudden sharp tone. “I can see the line of the underwear. Go and remove your panties.” </p><p>That comment was more than enough to break her silence. “What?” she murmured in shock.</p><p>“You need to remove your panties,” I repeated, pointing at the small section I sectioned to change clothes. “We can’t use the poses where the lines are caressed.” She looked like about to argue, even though my sharp tone had drained the fervor her first comment carried. “Hurry up, we need to finish it in a bit.” In actuality, we were already finished, the pictures I took were more than appropriate. The rest was just for my personal enjoyment. </p><p>It was a delicious view to see her walking towards the curtain of the changing section. Slow, hesitant, blushing, but walking nevertheless. She disappeared behind the fabric, invisible other than the rustling of the curtain. The blush on her face, and the insistent grasp of her fingers around the skirt was the proof for the absence of her panties. I assumed she left them on the rack. But I decided to risk flying closer to the sun. “Why are you still wearing your bra,” I said. </p><p>“That needs to go as well?” she questioned, only to receive a stiff, unforgiving nod in response. She ducked her head, but walked behind the screen nonetheless. </p><p>She was out once more after another round of fumbling, in a visual that would be enough to trigger arousal in a rock. Her tits squeezed by the tight grasp of the chest area, the lines mysteriously alluding to the treasure underneath, her nipples shouting their presence proudly. “Excellent,” I said. “You are an amazing model, Nicole,” I said, once again rewarding her for her good behavior. “Why don’t you walk back to the set so we can continue our business.” </p><p>She followed my command, once again without a complaint, cycling through the poses, though in every pause, her hands found the hem of the dress, pulling down obsessively to ensure nothing was revealed. I said nothing to prevent it, because that action had a side effect she failed to notice. With each pull, the dress was getting lower, enhancing the cleavage she was sporting. I decided to use it to the maximum effect. “Remember the pose we took with the last dress, where you lean forward, surprised. Do it.” </p><p>It was a testament of her obedience instinct that she followed my command without even a blink, one of her hands pointing the ground, the other pressing to her lips in a facsimile of naughty surprise, both arms pressing on the sides of her breasts, when combined with the angle, providing the perfect view for my attention. I was tempted to ask her to pull her dress even lower, but I was afraid that the spell would be broken if I push too hard. </p><p>Instead, I decided to use some reverse psychology. “Nicole, pull your dress up a bit, you are displaying too much cleavage for the pose.” She looked down, only to blush into a painful red when she realized the extent of flesh she was showing. She tried to rise, but I was ready to prevent it. “Don’t break the pose,” I ordered. She kept the pose, but grabbed and pulled the dress until the cleavage turned downright modest. Just as I planned, I noted as I took a few more pictures. “Now, the same pose, but turn your back to me.” </p><p>Distracted by the latest realization, she failed to realize just how shorter the skirt had become when she pulled to overcompensate for the cleavage. With the dress riding upwards, I was treated with the perfect view of her pussy, its shining wetness a good confirmation about her particular inclination of following orders. I took a few quick photos before ordering her to stand up for another, more conservative pose. I would have liked to continue in that pose, of course, but unfortunately, it wasn’t worth the risk. </p><p>“I think we can call it a day,” I said with a smile, noticing a discernible expression of disappointment passing through her face. Another sign that I wasn’t the only one that enjoyed the proceedings. “You were an amazing model, Nicole, and an absolute delight to work with.” I left the camera fixed on the tripod and took a few steps towards her. “Now why don’t you give me a hug, it’s traditional.” </p><p>“If it’s traditional,” she murmured in reticence, standing passively as I walked towards them. Her arms rose, wrapping tight around my shoulder, and I put mine on the small of her back. I would have preferred to slid it under her skirt to molest her poorly covered bottom, but unfortunately, that wasn’t a probability. Instead, I focused on the sensation of her breasts pressing against my chest, barely reduced by the soft fabric of the dress. It was a long hug, one that would be awkward if her hold was any looser, but with the mood she was in, it wasn’t hard to guess I wasn’t the only one enjoying it. </p><p>“Anyway,” I said as I unwrapped my arms around her. “I need to process the photos, but we can go over them after the dinner, before I sent them out. Would that work for you?” She nodded. “Also,” I asked. “I don’t have any time to go out for a dinner. It wouldn’t be a bother if I joined you for the dinner, right?” I received another nod, then she turned and climbed upwards. In her distracted state, she had managed to miss the effect it would have when she walked upstairs while wearing a short dress made shorter by her fixing, especially since her panties lay forgotten on my impromptu dressing room. </p><p>My new tenancy was going to be more fun than I had initially envisioned, I realized as I watched the amazing view my landlady created. </p>",

    "content": "“Are you sure it is the best way to go, honey,” Sarah asked. “I know that things are bad, maybe we can take a bank loan or something instead of this partnership.” <p>“I’m afraid that it isn’t possible,” her husband answered with a shrug. “We already have several loans that are about to mature, and our assets are almost completely depleted. Taking a loan is simply not possible. But even it was, it wouldn’t save us, just delay the inevitable. The problem is not just money, but the new model that’s coming from this mysterious new competitor. They are simply cheaper and better than ours, and they destroyed our sales completely. We need to be able to do something different to get back our competitive edge. This partnership will allow us to package our tools with the some of the best software in the market. Frankly, it’s a matter of life and death. We either get this deal, or we end up in the streets, and the company that my great-grandfather built ceases to exist.” </p><p>“I understand, but making a deal with Erik… From the stories you told, you two weren’t in the best terms in high school or in college,” she murmured, trying to reflect back to the stories without accusing her husband of bullying.  </p><p>“Don’t worry about it, sweetheart,” Thomas said, dismissing her concerns. “It was just some childish scuffle, and it helped to build some character. Look at the difference, he was just a wimp in the high school, and now he has a very successful software company and has a net worth of millions. It would be impossible without me putting some character in him.” </p><p>“If you say so,” Sarah answered, her tone more than enough to convey her doubts. </p><p>“Don’t worry about it, my beautiful, and please make sure that tonight goes without a hitch. We need this deal, or the company is dead.” He chuckled, followed by a suggestive wink. “And don’t forget to dress to impress, it certainly wouldn’t hurt.” </p><p>With a sigh, Sarah stood up and started climbing up the stairs, trying to push her mind away from the concerns. She knew that she should trust her husband, sometimes it was hard. Still, she was going to give him her full support. There was a lot in stake. If the company went down, her comfortable lifestyle would go down with it, and the last thing she wanted to do was to get an actual job. If she was going to work, what was the point of marriage? </p><p>Inside the dressing room, she quickly undressed, revealing her shapely curves, carefully sculpted through hours of pilates and careful dieting, with a result she was proud of. After a bit of consideration, she decided to weaponize her sexiness. After all, her husband mentioned that it was a matter of life and death. If she wore a dress that was a bit shorter, or tighter than, usual, what was the harm in that? </p><p>With the objective in mind, she quickly cycled through the dresses, until her hand was hovering over a silk dress, colored silver. For a moment, she held back in hesitation, trying to decide whether it was appropriate for the night. It was a short dress, barely reaching to the middle of her thighs while she was standing, and it was even worse when she was sitting down. The cleavage wasn’t anything to scoff as well, dipping deep into her chest, revealing a generous amount of skin. Still, neither problem was the real one. The actual problem was its tightness. She had purchased the dress when she was weighing a couple pounds less, and even then, it was tight. </p><p>Her hand hovered over the dress for a few seconds, undecided. “What’s the harm trying,” she murmured, and pulled the dress off the rack. A brief struggle later, she was looking for a disappointing sight. While the dress fitted nice, both her bra and her panties shouted their presence bulky, a problem that she hadn’t experienced before. She was about to remove the dress in disappointment, when the devil on her shoulder whispered that there was no harm trying the dress without the underwear. After a brief struggle with its hooks, the bra came off, and she slid her fingers under her skirt to pull off her panties. </p><p>The result was magnificent, she realized with a proud smile, with the dress hugging her figure tight, outlining every line she had while somehow still managing to maintain the mystery, like a silvery dream. She took a note to wear that dress for a private dinner, when she wanted to blow her husband’s mind. She reached for a pair of silver stilettos, wanting to see the dress with the full ensemble. It wasn’t that she was going to wear that for the dinner, but she wanted to see how it looked. Some make-up and hair work followed the shoes, and she found herself examining herself in the mirror, for a dress she absolutely had no plans of wearing. Captivated, she paid little attention to the passage of minutes. </p><p>Then, she heard the door opened and her husband peeked on the door. “Erik sent a message that he was going to be there, hurry up.”</p><p>She felt the tendrils of panic spreading through her body, realizing that she had wasted too much time examining herself in the mirror instead of trying to pick a more appropriate dress. “Not ready yet, honey,” she said. </p><p>“It has been twenty minutes,” her husband’s answer came, his voice much harsher. “How the hell you still couldn’t find a freaking dress. It’s not one of our usual dates, where you can keep me waiting for three hours!” </p><p>“I tried something, but it was a bit more revealing than I expected,” she answered, trying to justify herself, ignoring her husband’s jibe. </p><p>“Doesn’t matter, just come out,” he answered. “Maybe it would help him make up his mind,” he added with a laugh. </p><p>Shocked by her husband’s uncalled comment, she wasn’t able to utter a word before she heard his footsteps, getting away from the bedroom. Shocked, and a bit angry. She looked at her reflection for a second, a spark in her eyes. “If you say so, husband,” she murmured to herself, her expression determined. If he wanted revealing, she would give him revealing. She wasn’t going to wear it for the dinner of course, but she wanted her husband to throw a jealous fit before changing.  </p><p>She followed stairs to the first floor, where her husband was putting the last touches on the dinner table. Hearing her steps, he turned, only for his eyes to grow. “What the hell are you wearing!” he said, not bothering to hide his anger. </p><p>“I’m dressed to impress, just as you asked me to,” she informed him with great pleasure enjoying the expression on his face as it lasted. She was sure that he was going to ask her to go back and change her dress, and it was more than okay for her. She made her point, after all. </p><p>“That wasn’t what I had in mind,” he said. She felt a victorious smile spreading across her face, enjoying pulling one over her husband, one that he noticed as well. At that point, the bell rang, but Sarah’s attention was taken by something much more important, the sudden stubbornness on her husband's face. “Anyways,” he said viciously, sure of his victory over their small battle. “It’s too late for you to change your dress anyways. Why don’t we just go greet our esteemed guest.” </p><p>His play was clear, he wanted her to fold first. Sarah kept her eyes locked with his, trying to convey the impression that she was not willing to fold, expecting him to be one that folded first, considering the jealous grumbles he had even when she wore revealing clothes even when they weren’t at the level of her current attire. </p><p>They were still staring each other when the doorbell rang for a second time, this time lasting for a bit longer, declaring impatience. She took a step towards the door, sure that her husband was going to call her off. </p><p>But he didn’t. </p><p>Instead, he took a few quick steps until he was at her side, and started following her trek towards the door. With each step they took towards the door, her certainty about her husband’s staying power faded a bit more, but conversely, her determination rose with it. If he was willing to risk her wearing such a revealing clothing next to his new business partner just out of spite, who was her to disappoint. </p><p>“Sarah,” he murmured in a reproachful tone once they were standing in front of the door. </p><p>“Yes,” she answered, but she realized her mistake before the word finished forming. Her tone was smug and victorious, and one thing her husband didn’t like, was to admit defeat, and her voice was a good example of it. Still, she had to admit, she had a similar disposition, which was why she said nothing as his husband reached for the doorknob, putting his best business smile as well. She turned towards the door, a fake smile on her lips, a sinking feeling in her stomach.</p><p>Still, she thought. Maybe it wouldn’t be as bad as she hoped. </p><p>But her hopes were dashed as soon as the door was opened, revealing the prospective business partner of her husband, whose eyes flicked to her body for a moment, his smile widening, though thankfully her husband missed it. She knew just how jealous her husband could be, and the last thing they needed was to burn their last hope in a spark of anger. “Erik,” his husband said in a tone so sincere that there was no chance it wasn’t faked. A tone that matched to the pitch by their guest as they shook hands. </p><p>Sarah used that time to examine Erik, and she wasn’t really impressed. He was tall, almost as tall as her husband, but he was skinny, lacking the carefully maintained bulk of her husband. Similarly, his hair had a decent amount of gray, making him reflect his actual age of forties. If she didn’t know already, Sarah wouldn’t believe her husband was at the same age in him. </p><p>“Let me take your coat,” Sarah interjected, making him turn towards her. His back turned to Thomas, his eyes dipped low towards her cleavage, not even bothering to hide as he passed his coat to her. She felt her skin crawl, but her smile stayed strong, repeating in her mind that it was critical for the business. But even now, she was regretting her ridiculous streak of stubbornness, resulting in her wearing such a revealing clothing with a man she just met. She wished that it was possible for her to go and change her clothes, but unfortunately, that was impossible, not without insulting their guest. </p><p>She did the only thing she could, she gave no outward reaction for his hungry gaze, not wanting to galvanize Thomas’ ire, which would doubtlessly destroy the deal they were supposed to sign. Instead, she took the coat, turned, and reached for the hanger, trying to ignore the way the dress climbed up. </p><p>“So, Erik, how have you been since we last talked,” her husband interjected, pulling Erik’s attention away. </p><p>“All well,” Erik answered before raising his hands. “By the way, please accept this humble gift,” he added, passing the bottle he was carrying to Thomas, wrapped nicely. </p><p>“You shouldn’t,” Thomas said as he took the lead towards the living room, to have some casual talk before moving to the dinner. Sarah followed them a step behind, not wanting to feel his gaze crawling over her skin once more. Though she had a feeling that she wasn’t able to avoid that for the rest of the night. </p><p>“Why don’t I put some drinks for us,” Sarah asked after they reached for the living room, taking the wrapped bottle from her husband’s hands. Then, without wasting any time, she moved to the kitchen. In the kitchen, she run her fingers over the cover, carefully unwrapping it without a damage, a childhood habit she was yet to overcome. </p><p>An annoyed sigh escaped her mouth as the bottle stood in front of her, naked. “Great, another scotch nut,” she murmured in distaste. Contrary to her husband, she was never able to develop a taste to stronger liquors, and scotch was no exception, even the nicer varieties like the one she was holding in her hands, evident by number thirty-seven, highlighted proudly in the middle of the bottle, declaring that the bottle was considerably older than her. “Ironic,” she murmured, but still feeling hopeful. She didn’t know how much a thirty-seven-year-old scotch cost, but she was willing to bet that it was at least mid four-figures. Erik’s willingness to bring such an expensive gift was an indicator of his acceptance. People didn’t waste thousands of dollars on the deals they were planning to reject, after all. </p><p>She quickly prepared a tray, three glasses carefully arranged around the bottle which was holding the center, all surrounded by some high-quality snacks, just enough to whip up the appetite. She took the tray and walked back the living room, only for both males to turn to her, their gazes lingering. However, both managed to look at the wrong place. Thomas’ eyes were stuck on the bottle while Erik’s were firmly on her cleavage instead, the grin on his face making her feel dirty. For the business, she repeated in her mind, doing her best to keep her face neutral. </p><p>“Erik, you shouldn’t have to,” her husband said with a tender tone that was enough to make Sarah jealous of the bottle. “Such an exquisite selection, it must have cost a fortune.” </p><p>“No worries, nothing is too much for my old friend,” Erik answered, and Thomas nodded happily. Sarah knew that she should have relaxed as well, as the discussion between them was indicating that their past relationship was much more friendly than she had guessed. But her instincts shouted otherwise, unable to trust the smile Erik displayed as he mentioned their past friendship. So, she mumbled an excuse about checking the dinner and walked back to the kitchen. </p><p>Another mistake, she realized ten minutes later, when she walked back to the living room after completing the finishing touches, only to met with an unwelcome surprise. The liquid level of the bottle had already passed the half-level, and even worse, from the reddish glow on her husband’s face, it wasn’t hard to guess who was responsible for it. She wished that they were in a setting that a kick in a shin was an appropriate response… “Dinner is ready,” she called instead, hoping that she could discourage her husband from drinking any more. </p><p>She didn’t have much hope on that, with the loving way his fingers wrapped around the bottle, carrying it on the table. Still, she tried. “Honey, how about we leave the scotch after the dessert, remember, we have that beautiful merlot we picked up.” </p><p>“Maybe it’s the best if we leave it on the rack. It’s best if we don’t mix the alcohols, right, Erik?” </p><p>“I agree,” he answered, his mocking smile missed out by her husband. “It’s best if we stick to scotch.” </p><p>“See,” Thomas said, patting Erik’s shoulder, unable to control his strength due to his drunkenness. Erik stumbled forward, and Sarah smiled amusedly, though her smile only lasted until she saw the flash of a furious expression on Erik’s face, sending chills inside her. It evaporated as soon as it came, but it was enough to leave a lasting impression.  </p><p>But if that was like that, why he was here, she tried to understand. Why chipping in to save the business of a man he didn’t like… </p><p>Distracted by her concerns, she paid little attention to the table other than serving the appetizers, which was why she was caught blindsided by the sudden laugh let out by her husband, loud and distracting. </p><p>“Oh man, do you remember the gym class when we were at high school, when we hid your clothes after the shower, wasn’t that hilarious,” he said, his slurring much more noticeable. Just a glance was enough to discover the reason, the bottle was almost finished, and with the reddish glow on Thomas’ face, it wasn’t hard to guess who was the responsible for the majority. To make things worse, she could see Erik’s eyes flashing with anger with the mention of the story. Yet another clue that so-called hearty jokes were much crueler than her husband remembered. </p><p>Then, she felt something caressing her leg. She turned to her husband, and was about to warn him about getting frisky, only to realize his arms were above table, moving heatedly as he reminisced about yet another story of his past. The realization about the source hit her like a punch, her head whiplashing towards the guest, only to meet with a smile she couldn’t decipher. </p><p>Her mind went into overdrive, but her body was frozen. She stood helpless as his foot slowly climbed up her thigh, edging the skirt of her dress. His brazenness was enough to break through her shock, and her hand slid towards his foot, pushing it away, hoping that it was enough to fix whatever misunderstanding that led him to think she was interested in him. </p><p>Her hopes were dashed when instead of the admonished realization, his face flashed with a nasty smile, and his foot was back on her leg, playing a game of footsie she neither wanted, nor welcomed. She turned to her husband, thinking about asking for help, but the words died in her mouth. If she tried to tell her husband, she didn’t know what his reaction would be in his drunken state. </p><p>She tried to push it away once more, but this time, his foot didn’t budge from its destination, partially because she was unable to push too hard, afraid that the commotion would grab her husband’s attention. She turned to Erik and mouthed him to stop, but the only effect was the widening of his smile. </p><p>Panicked, she decided retreat was the best option. “Who wants some dessert,” she said as she stood up.</p><p>“I wouldn't say no to some sweets,” Erik answered, letting his gaze crawl over her body, leaving no doubt about what he was referring to.</p><p>Not that her husband noticed it, of course, using the opportunity to reach towards the bottle once more. “No for me,” he simply said before focusing on the bottle. Her hands squeezed, wanting to use the bottle as an improvised weapon. On whom, she was undecided.</p><p>She was already in the kitchen, reaching for the plates when she realized that she wasn't alone. She would have liked to notice it due to footsteps, or something similar, but unfortunately, it occurred it through an unwelcome intimacy. </p><p>“Let me help you,” a voice that definitely didn't belong to her husband whispered simultaneously with two hands resting gently on her waist. She flinched, the plate that she was holding slid from her hand, only for his hand to blur towards it, catching it in the air. “Careful, sweetheart,” he said, the other hand sliding to her stomach in an undeserved intimacy.</p><p>She tried to get away, her skin crawling with his uninvited touch. She managed to turn, but his other hand was back in place before she could completely get away, locking her between his body and the kitchen counter, face to face in a caricature of an intimate embrace. </p><p>“Get away from me,” she said with as much as bile she could muster in a whisper, putting her hands on his torso, but her attempt to push yielded no result. He was much stronger than his frame suggested. She wanted to slap him, pushing it away, but she held back, wanting to see whether she could handle it without escalating it to an outright violence, a certainty if her husband was going to get involved. </p><p>“I will if you repeat it, but I want you to think it very carefully before saying so,” he whispered in a tone that could be mistaken for tender if she wasn’t seeing his face. “If I go, I'll leave the house, and take the deal with me, leaving my good friend for bankruptcy.”</p><p>“What If you go, we can always find a new partner,” she answered, trying to bluff. She was aware that they were simply out if time to find a new partner, but she hoped that she could convince him otherwise. </p><p>“With less than twenty days of cash to sustain the business, not to mention the debt that is about to mature in exactly thirty-four days?” </p><p>Her next words died before forming, replaced with a question. “How do you know that?” she asked because she was sure her husband would never tell those particular details.</p><p>“You would be surprised how easy to bribe the accountant of a failing company to reveal financial details. Something about knowing just how close he is about to be jobless,” he answered. </p><p>A sinking feeling passed through her stomach, realizing the full extent of the position she found herself in. She could push him away, or call her husband, but that would destroy the last chance of saving the business, leaving them penniless… She said nothing, but she didn’t have to, her expression told everything that was needed. </p><p>“Good girl,” he said, bringing his hand to her cheek, patting softly like she was a particularly slow child who managed to come with the answer after the teacher all but spelled the solution, smug and patronizing… She hated it, the feeling of being trapped, a sensation that she was familiar from the past. It was like when she was a college student, auditioning for modeling gigs. The first time the photographer came with that exact offer, she had slapped him, only for him to blacklist her from all agencies, waiting for her to fold. That time, meeting Thomas saved her from the debacle she was facing, allowing her to escape the debacle. Not an option this time, not when he was the exact leverage Erik was abusing to force her into compliance. </p><p>She could feel tears gathering in her eyes as his hand slid down to her neck, moving down at a torturous pace, leaving a track of flame aftermath despite its fleeting pressure. She took a deep breath, steeling herself. She was cornered, but she refused to cry. “Such a beautiful red color,” he murmured, passing his fingers through her hair, though she barely paid attention to that, her focus stolen by her other hand, moving on her belly. Once again, she cursed herself for picking that particular dress. She could feel his touch like the fabric wasn’t there at all, his fingers directly on her skin. </p><p>Her desire to run away rose as his hands crawled past her collarbones, and arrived the generous cleavage she was sporting. He used one finger to slowly drag inside, touching her skin. “I feel that it was the exact result you were planning, Sarah,” he said as he continued tracing the revealed portion of her breasts. </p><p>“No,” she answered in a moment’s rebellion. </p><p>“Really,” he answered, deeply amused. “Then please explain to me, why are you dressed in a way that would make a streetwalker blush?” </p><p>She said nothing, because there was nothing to say. She could explain how an argument, built on a ridiculous misunderstanding, ballooned through stubbornness of both parties until she found herself wearing a slutty dress for a man she was yet to meet, but both knew that he wasn’t interested in that. It was just another way for him to molest her, like the fingers that were caressing her body. </p><p>“I think that’s enough for now,” he said, making her relax despite the ominous meaning of the last two words. “If we spend more time, my precious friend will start to wonder where we are.” She ignored the tone of victory his tone held, as all the pity she had felt about his difficult school years evaporated when he decided to use her a tool for his revenge. </p><p>He took a step back, and she walked away from him, directly to the kitchen to remove the desert. She would have preferred to leave the room instantly, but she didn’t want to explain to Thomas where the dessert was. But her walk to the fridge was aborted halfway when an arm wrapped around her waist, preventing her movement. She felt a distinct presence pressing to her bottom, its size apparent even through his pants. Before she could comment, she felt his fingers grabbing her breast over the dress, but this time, it wasn’t the soft, fleeting touches. His fingers sank into her flesh without warning, forcing a loud cry from her. </p><p>“Are you okay, honey,” came the voice of her husband from inside. </p><p>“I hit my toe to the counter,” she answered automatically. </p><p>“Smart,” Erik whispered into her ear, patted her bottom like he was rewarding her, then pulled back as quick as he first came. “See you inside, sweetheart,” he added, and left the kitchen, leaving her trembling with an impotent rage. </p><p>“I hate this,” she murmured to herself, trying to process the horrible turn the night took. Just a couple hours ago, she was playfully arguing with her husband, happy that the company was about to be saved, only to find herself helpless as she found herself being paved by a stranger. Still, she forced a fake smile on her face before going back to the living room, not wanting for her husband to realize something was amiss. It wasn’t a particularly convincing smile, she knew. Not that it mattered though, her husband was well-past the stage to distinguish the difference between a fake and a real smile.</p><p>“Dessert is here,” Erik said with a suggestive voice as she stepped inside the living room, a comment that was enough to erase the smile off her face. “Strawberries and cherries,” he added, making her glad for her husbands sloshed state for once. She was carrying chocolate mousse in the tray, which had neither strawberries nor cherries, making it an obvious reference to her hair color. She said nothing, just placed the tray in the table, and preparing to sit in her seat, but Erik patted to the chair next to him instead. She thought of rebelling and sitting next to her husband, not wanting to lose the protection that it afforded, but a pointed glare towards the door changed her mind, reminding her that he could leave at any second, and only her compliance stood between them and the bankruptcy.   </p><p>She sat next to Erik, and directly across her husband, who was insistent on paying more attention to the glass filled with the amber liquid. “Thomas, I’m curious where you met with this beautiful young lady? Why don’t you tell the story, I’m sure that’s quite romantic.” </p><p>“It was fate,” Thomas answered with a grandstanding manner, the question finally reminding him of her presence, his bloodshot eyes turning towards her. But it was too little, too late, as she could feel Erik’s fingers mapping her thighs. “We were visiting the college campus because Megan was trying to decide which college to start, and Sarah was the student that was responsible for leading the group.” </p><p>“Megan was your younger daughter, right?” Erik answered, and Sarah’s expression shifted angrily, for once not about Erik. Her relationship with Erik’s daughters was not the best. Admittedly, it was not a big surprise. The older one, Kelly, was just a year younger than her, and wasn’t very receptive to the idea that her father was marrying a woman a year senior to her. Sarah was yet to convince her that she actually loved Thomas and not just his money. </p><p>“Yes,” Thomas answered before switching back to the story of their first meeting, enthusiastically skipping through the details, occasionally getting lost in unexpected tangents. Normally, Sarah would be joining the story, highlighting the favorite parts of the story, like him purchasing an ice cream, only to collide with her, ruining both of her clothes… But if things were normal, there wouldn’t be another man sitting next to her, his fingers caressing her flesh, sliding dangerously close to the hem of her skirt. </p><p>Then, her problems suddenly multiplied when his fingers slid under her skirt and started exploring her inner thighs, dangerously close to her nether lips. Even worse, she could feel that her body starting to react his touches. Her body had always been weak to the foreplay, and for all the revulsion she felt intellectually, the body reacted primal, arousal building up slowly but steadily. </p><p>Her husband occasionally directed his statements to her, inviting her for her side of anecdotes, but she deflected them with answers that consisted a few words, afraid to speak any longer. At first, she was afraid of her potentials, but the presence of an errant moan started to become more of a problem with each passing moment, as his fingers caressed the sensitive skin of her thighs skilfully, contrasting his reprehensible personality. </p><p>“You seem a bit silent today, honey,” Thomas asked her suddenly, breaking his explanation. “Is something wrong?”</p><p>There was, but she was helpless to verbalize it. “Just focusing on the dessert-\" she started only for her explanation to be broken with a moan, because Erik leveraged the exact moment to the break the barrier and slid his fingers inside her, sending a fresh wave of stimulant through her body.</p><p>“Wow,” her husband said. “Is it really that good,” Thomas said, misunderstanding the driver of her loss of control.</p><p>“I hope it is,” Erik interjected, his finger pumping furiously inside her, leaving her unable to answer the question.</p><p>She filled her spoon with a generous portion of the mousse, wanting to have an excuse for not talking, but his fingers twisted just as she was putting the spoon in her mouth, her twitch causing the dessert to paint her lips inside. </p><p>“Let me help you clean, honey,” Thomas said, leaning forward. Sarah leaned to met him in the middle, afraid that he would see what was going on under the table. She felt his lips press hers aggressively. Normally, his touch would be enough to make her feel relaxed and happy, but this time it was different, the relaxation she felt as Erik’s fingers left her body overwhelming everything. </p><p>But her relied hadn't been long lived. She had missed one really important fact about her position. To reach her husband, she had to raise her bottom off the chair, and that had the unforeseen side effect of giving an easy access to her assaulter, a fact she realized when she felt three of his fingers slid inside her, mercilessly ramming her. And to make things even worse, her husband was feeling randy from the alcohol, his arms gently holding hers to prevent her from pulling back. And the fear of her husband noticing what was going on wasn't exactly a helpful measure to the mixture.</p><p>Her torture lasted for an eternity even if the clock would say for just a minute until finally, the climax hit her. She would have preferred to rejoice that the most humiliating experience of her life was over, but trying to stay on her feet was taking all the focus she could generate. </p><p>Her husband pulled back a few seconds later with a large smile on his face, completely unaware of the humiliation she just experienced. </p><p>Before she could even begin to relax, however, Erik spoke once more. “Should we go back to living room, to discuss some business,” he said, but his eyes were on her, telling that it was just a beginning...</p>",
